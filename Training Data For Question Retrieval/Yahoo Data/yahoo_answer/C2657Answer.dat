There's also been TV Ads on by WRangler with this slogan.  They're pretty neat - I like them too.    If I find one in one of the many WH mags I'm behind on readin' I'll be glad to send it to ya or something....|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Never heard of it.    Sorry.|`|wM8qRy5laa	Yes I love that ad too. You can look it up on youtube if you want the video but the ad just buy a magazine that has it in there.
b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	Its always best to be safer than sorry ~ if your concerned and or something is just not right, it would not hurt to call and question to see if  you need to take him in.    If he is only 2lbs, diarrhea can dehydrate a dog real fast ~ I'd call if I was you...|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	only a vet can diagnose what is going on. if your instincts are telling you to see a vet then trust that instinct. he does need to be examined and it can be treated. the weight seems too low. sounds like he needs to be screened for worms. yes. take him in.|`|W0buucLsaa	You better take him to the vet tomorrow and have them do a fecal sample... he could have caught parvovirus. And that would need immediate treatment just to ensure his survival. He probably needs to get some shots or something anyways.    If he starts vomiting or stops drinking water, take him to the vet IMMEDIATELY, do not pass go, do not collect $200.|`|9UttDvcsaa	I would take him to the vet and get him checked.  He is young and you want to rule out anything that might be a minor problem now.  When you go take some of his poop with you, they can see if he has parasites, most pups do!  Good Luck with your new dog! :-)|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Yes, take him to the vet.    He needs to go back to his mama for another 4 weeks.  His mama would have know exactly what to do.  You probably made him sick with what you fed him,  maybe he didn't get his shots & hes got Parvo.    Here it is against the law to release a pup under 8 weeks of age.  Some breeders will not release a pup until is is 12 weeks old.    That like keeping a child out of school for 12 years & then telling him he has to be out of the house now.  That child may be only 18, not educated at all, speaks but uses poor language & he is expected to go out & get a job.  Doing what?  What does he know?    Puppies need to stay with in the family unit until they have learned things you take for granted.  Bit inhibition, pecking order, teat placement determines a lot, mom is still stimulating the pup to pee & poop.    Your puppy isn't going to be very smart as he gets older cause he was not allowed to learn from mom & siblings.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Puppy was born Christmas Eve '08. That makes him 6 weeks old today, he could have stayed with his Mom a little longer. How long have you had him? The reason is that Mom's milk builds his immunity to diseases like Parvo, Distemper, Leptospirosis and others. Try to get him to a vet ASAP, if his poop smells rancid, worse than usual, it could be an early sign of Parvo. I don't mean to scare you but Parvo is can be really bad for a 2 pound pup. Even if it is not Parvo Virus, being so small will lead to dehydration even faster. If it's just Gastritis or an intestinal bug you still need to get him to a vet. He needs deworming and vaccines. Being that small and taken from the mom so young you don't want to take chances.    ADD: You where told not to take him to the vet because in most states it is illegal to sell a puppy before 8 weeks. You will not get in trouble and you pup will not be taken away, but some vets will report the breeder and she can get fined, lose her breeder license or get it suspended if she has one. No, this will not affect your unborn child or any child. It is not a zoonotic disease. Regarless if the pup is sick or not. He should get his first round of shots and fecal right at 6 weeks and again 3 weeks later, the vet will give you a vaccine schedule just like a babies. Good luck and Congrats.|`|Toj8xh3laa	has he been to the vet to get his shots and be wormed? all puppies have worms...they need to be wormed each time they get their shots...this is what it sounds like to me....|`|5Up1iL3Saa	My husband and I had a boston terrier that had diarrhea. I think you should take him to the doctor if it don't soon stop.|`|f96dbdfb33ecfe1ebea6423d5d7fc870aa	This is a young pup. YES take to a vet. It could be as bad as parvo, or poisoning from eating something it shouldn't have, or as easy as an upset stomach. Either way, the puppy can die from dehydration. When in doubt, always take your pet to a vet, better safe than sorry.  If you cannot go to an ER vet, please start hydrating the puppy with water, via a eye dropper drip in it's mouth, or adding TONS of water to a tiny bit of wet food, ensuring the puppy is drinking.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	yes you should take him to the vet. its not normal for any puppy in any breed to loose weight and be lethargic.|`|jaFwZN8Caa	crismas pups always have problems|`|AA11097877	U can give him orginal non flavour glucose drink , and bring the dog to the vet . Yah . Pet need to vaccinate against distemper(Diarrhea) is one of the symptoms. A pup need to be vaccinate at least 2 times when they are just born. Bring the dog to vet , u dont want a dead dog in the house .
hJAtgbb8aa	The hamsters should be separated from the mother when they have weaned, as in, they know how to eat themselves and do not depend on mother's milk anymore.  Hamsters can become sexually mature as young as 4 weeks old...so if the males have weaned by then, it is wise to separate them from the females when they are a week old, while you can leave the girls with the mom for another 2 weeks.  The fight for territory usually begins when they are 6 weeks old...that is when they should be separated from the mother, and kept in their own cage.  I've had my hamster pups (all females) attack the mom and she was badly injured...so never underestimate them.    The correct age would be 5 weeks after the birth.      (\_(\  (=' :') --  (,(")(")  ? -To?'? ????-?  ?- -??? ??????- -?  ?- ?-- ?- ?  ?????????|`|TTs6GBBUaa	5 - 6 weeks and make sure to take the males out from the females. The females can stay with mom but the males need their own cage.|`|vdDK1Gikaa	4 weeks minimum|`|UG9Yb7ERaa	You can take baby hamsters away from as young as 3 weeks old, but if they don't seem mature enough(i.e. still drinking mama's milk, not eating solid food, etc.) you can keep them together until they're 6 weeks old. Be sure to split them into separate sex groups by 6 weeks because they are sexually mature at that age and before you know it you will have oodles of hamsters.|`|6fgdYkHAaa	You will know when the time is right they will start eating and drinking on there own .
8EyDsAt6aa	I'm really sorry for your loss. The problem with pet stores is they never take care of their small fury animals right and many die in the store or are about to die anyway since pet stores treat small and furry animals as merchandise and not animals. PETA has done a great job of changing that for in the store but unfortunately Rainbow exotics still mistreats the animals before they get to the pet store.  I recommend finding a local breeder or adopting one from a nearby shelter. Normally craigslist always has guinea pigs or adoption everyday. Babies even. I got two guinea pigs from a local breeder and they ended up being the happiest little guinea pigs ever. The best you can do is try to adopt a young one and give it a happy home.|`|E9cIfOf1aa	Aww I have three guinea pigs, and I feel your pain. I suggest getting a Syrian hamster or pair of same sex Roborovskii hamsters. They are very hearty, but do not get them from Petsmart or Petco! I get all my animals from my local Humane Society and they come cheap and usually socialized. Syrian hamsters can have a lot of genetic defects but if it is in the shleter ask an employee about it. Or you could get a Deguu! I love my old Degu.|`|QXffenE8aa	that has to be the saddest guinea pig story I've ever heard. i recommend a dwarf, syrian, and/or roborovski hamsters. very small, very cute, and they're the best cure for loneliness on the planet. other than chocolate and old sit coms...|`|PCwrBQ4Paa	That is a sad story :(    I suggest getting a rat or a teddy bear hamster. They are both recommended for first time pets (rats a little more because they are less likely to bite). And both are lovable! But a word to the wise a lot of rats are likely to get a tumor normally later in life tho. And use dust free bedding to prevent respiratory illnesses. And I agree with the others that adopting from a humane society is a good way to give those animals a loving home.|`|P7XZFK8Baa	I have a chinchilla and i love him  they're so soft, have no claws, and i have yet to be bitten   they live for 15-20 years, if they're taken care of  but they are slightly high maintanance  they require daily excercise (i let mine run around in my room for about an hour)  they need to bath in chinchilla sand bath regularily (whenever i let him out)  they eat strictly chinchilla pellets once daily, and timothy hay the rest of the time  they also can't have pine shavings, and need lots to chew on       it sounds like a lot of work, but it becomes routine and it takes little thought for me now,  but they are adorable and entertaining little creatures    if you do decide to get one, contact me for waiting periods and any other questions =]

4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	A lot of us old folks are just as glad that our "gay blade" days are behind us!    Seriously, his weight loss and increased appetite are symptoms of hyperthyroidism.  The condition is treatable with daily medication and it MUST be treated.  So please take your former Romeo in for an exam and a blood panel, including the special T-4 for thyroid function and get him on medication if he needs it.|`|AA10091923	as my vet has said..."this bothers you more than him".  he is not embarrassed, he is not wanting to hang with his buds...he probably is not having a medical problem...but the fact of the matter is that he is old!  9 yrs old is approximately 52 yrs old...yes not tooo old for us..but for a small 4 legged creature it is!   He now prefers to be by your side instead of out catting like his younger days.    Yes, many of them do get thin in later years...but compare that to your grandma or someone older...didnt they get thinner as they got older...my mom did!  my grandma did!  I am!  it happens....and cats are the closest to humans in anatomy....so it follows that everything you are seeing is because of aging.  Make his life as easy as possible and make things extremely easy for him.     I have 4 cats ages 18yrs to 15 yrs (88 yrs to 76 yrs) and the oldest can no longer jump onto the sofa or bed...so i have provided steps for him, i make his eating easier, a lower cat box etc....    Please just love him and make his life very easy....you may also want to make sure you get an annual check up for him.      I have included a link to an age chart for cats for you.  http://cats.about.com/cs/healthissues/a/...    good luck  :)  and thanks for asking|`|rsp33Aysaa	You could try feeding him some kitten food, it has more fats in it.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Yeah it's normal.    My cat's a fatty.  We just feed him whenever he stands near his dish and meows.. Which is 24/7.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Has he had a checkup lately?  He's at the age where cats can get illnesses and "mask" them, so that we don't know they're sick, until they CAN'T HIDE it anymore.    Since he's always hungry, but is not gaining any weight, he may have an illness that can be treated if caught soon enough.  Is he drinking a lot of water?  Does his breath smell like acetone ( nail polish remover )?  These two things, along with the constant hunger and weight loss, are signs of diabetes!    To be on the safe side, take him to the vet for a blood test, to see what ( or if ) he has any illnesses.  Better to be safe than sorry.......    Hope this helps........Good luck.|`|x3RBy8Ljaa	This is the age where cats can develop a hyper active thyroid,  it doesn't matter how much he eats, he is not getting enough food.  Take him to the vet and ask for a thyroid check.  He can go on medication, he probably won't gain the weight back to due his age but it will stop the losing of more weight.    I went through the same thing with one of my boys and he made it to the age of 22 .   Good luck!

I know of no dogs being banned from the US....    Are you taling about the Corso, they are not banned from the US........|`|P0Fjh59Eaa	There is no single breed of dog that is nationally banned. Each individual state has the right to chose it's own legislation on laws and regulations. so while even if the supreme court rules one breed of dog banned from the US any state legislation can over rule the national law at the state level claiming the law to be unconstitutional.    there are many cities, counties and a few individual states that have bans on certain dog breeds. Mostly of the bully breed variety. which i find ridiculous.    there are other countries that ban certain breeds of dogs, but those countries have a different governmental structure from the US.

7Zqn3DdEaa	Well, really young dogs like that shouldn't eat sugary things.  Keep a SHARP eye on that puppy, and if you notice any changes (throwing up constantly, whining from stomach pain, or a change in his "poop", or anything abnormal) take him to the vet as soon as you can, because he might have swallowed something bad.  Its likely that he'll throw up at least once, and that MIGHT do the trick, if he gets all the disagreeable things out of his system.  If you're still unsure, you should call the vet and see what they have to say.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	anything sugar free can kill a dog. contact your vet soon.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	Call er vet.,  The sugar free ice cream maybe has xylitol in it and that is toxic to dogs.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Sugar free can be dangerous for dogs.

There is nothing of good quality sold at Walmart, but PetSmart does have Blue Buffalo Wilderness.    95% of the protein comes from real meat.   Grain-free.

Thus the best is the cheapest in my books.    But if you're going to be feeding your cat wet food extremely often (like every day because maybe it has no teeth or something), try to buy cat food that has meat (not 'by-products', but REAL meat!) as the main ingredient(s), that is very low in ash (always important, no matter what food you buy!), and if your kitty is pudgy, low in fat will not hurt it either.|`|AA10859773	Walmart-nothing.    Petsmart may also carry By Nature Organics which is a good food.  I don't know if they all carry it, but if yours doesn't you could ask them to.|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	I suggest taking a look at petfooddirect.com and looking at their selection of grain free foods. From there, you can go to the website of the brands of food you like the best to use the store locator.     I'm the most impressed by Wellness brand wet foods since most of them are grain free and list actual organ meats instead of just "by-products".     I actually go a step further and feed my cats raw meat. It saves me a lot of money since I have 3 large cats and a kitten to feed and I like knowing exactly what they're eating. A lot of people think that feeding raw is a lot more expensive but I buy whole meats and break them down to cat size myself so I only spend about $30 a month to feed 4 cats when it would cost around $75 a month to feed them all high quality wet food.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	Whiskas|`|5W18CzEsaa	Last week, I found, well balanced canned cat food in cheapest price at http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c2...  .

AA10470681	If it's a possibility I would ask your parents to take the time to start socializing her. Some of their friends must have dogs. maybe she could start making friends that way. But, if that's not possible then:     I think most people understand that it's the little guys who pretend to be the toughest and I'm sure there will be plenty of other dogs that will have something to say for themselves. Dogs LOVE going for walks and in my experience most of them are so happy that they forget everything else. At 8 lbs you can always carry her in something if you need to like one of those purse dog carriers or the front style backpacks.    And No they are not going to ask you to leave and your going to have so much fun with your little one. No more worrying, OK ? It's great that your raising money and your going to have a great day ! :~)|`|9UttDvcsaa	If you have time before the walk, hopefully weeks.  Take her to dog parks and get her socialized.  Don't just drop the bomb on her the day of the walk when it matters to you.  Dogs need socialization from People and other dogs.  If she barks her head off, trust me she won't be the only one!  Good Luck!|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Just don't walk near anybody.      and/or get a muzzle|`|Toj8xh3laa	start socializing her now...get her to your house and start taking her to dog parks,etc...anywhere she can be around other dogs...most small breeds have "little dog syndrome" and will generally calm down once they realize that the other dogs are not going ot hurt them or you...good luck to you|`|K97esxDsaa	If you know your dog reacts in an aggressive way to other people and dogs, do not take her to a place with many people and dogs. In addition to scaring other people and dogs, it will probably stress her out and may lead her to bite, even if she's never bitten anyone before.    It would be safer and more responsible to just leave her at home.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	It's good that you want to support a charity but for heavens sake if your dog is disruptive and aggressive don't take it to this walk because it will cause fights with other dogs.  Only well behaved dogs should be taken on these walks.    I truly hope that you are told to leave if your dog causes trouble. It's not fair to other dogs or their owners and it spoils what should be a good day for all.

NaM4ZT64aa	Do not add more polish.  Simply continue to use your regular oils and conditioners and the scratch will gradually fade.      Putting polish on the saddle is a bad idea for two reasons.  One, it is made to be used in sporadic amounts, so that would be pretty expensive to rub it into the entire saddle.  Second, you would probably discolor all of the leather, resulting in it looking dark and mottled.    If the scratch is bad enough, it is possible that you will always be able to see it a little, but if you simply continue maintaining the leather in a normal routine, it will fade until you won't be able to find it unless you're looking.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	if the first application didin't blotch up the saddle then perhaps more application won't either. also where is the scratch. it might not show when your sitting in it. i would keep polishing.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Use it on the whole saddle.
Ayn7tpXKaa	Unless you plan to be a lovebird breeder, hens laying eggs can deplete them of calcium, so it's best not to encourage it.  Yes, you need a male and a female to have fertile eggs - however, hens lay eggs regardless.    Anything that resembles a nest box should be taken out of the cage if you don't plan to breed them.  And if you DO plan to breed them, it is very time consuming and a lot of effort, hand feeding many many times a day, etc, so do a LOT of research beforehand and make sure you can commit to it.  Make sure you'll be a responsible breeder, as well.    As for toys.  I make twisty boingy toys out of paper towel rolls cut up so it's like a loop.  I also notice they love bells, swings, and mirrors with bells and beads.  Make sure they have enough perches.    Lovebirds also LOVE spray millet, and it's good for them.  Good luck!|`|AA11174528	My little lovies LOVE swings. I don't know what it is but they do. Paper seems to be a fun toy (lovebirds are very destructive). Little strips of fabric (they sell these at pet stores as well) also seems to be popular with mine.   They will need a nestbox if you want them to lay and do NOT put two lovebirds of the same sex together, there is a good chance that they will fight and try to destroy eachother.|`|7W8mw4qoaa	they love bells :p    females can lay eggs no matter what, but you'd need a male to fertilize it if you want babies|`|vkT38799aa	They lik swings..And you do need a male for your female if u want chicks...And pls put a nest box inside ur cage for your female love bird to lay eggs in.... Without a nest box she won't lay....|`|r7I7FoNMaa	Is this for real?  Too much time on your hands?  Then read!  Google raising lovebirds.    There are many commercial small toys made for love birds.    And YES you a male and female if you want fertile eggs.  If you want a pet just get one lovebird.
qp7ssYJcaa	Make sure that it is safe for her to eat. Cat litter/cedar/pine or any clumping litter can be fatal to your hamster.
euj0PYpgaa	They love attention!!! I use to have one and she loved getting all the attention she could. She did not like being confined to one area, she loved being out and about around the house and I would take her outside with me sometimes, but only supervised cause otherwise she would take off. She liked to sleep right next to me, sometimes she wanted to sleep down by my feet other times she wanted to sleep on the pillow next to me... she was definetly independent and very friendly...|`|wM8qRy5laa	My is so fun to be around.

px27V5N9aa	I don't know why everyone is saying he's too thin..he's not.  If anything he's got some fat on him.  See that divot running down his spine?  That little gully?  He's got fat on him.  You can't even see his ribs when he's running.  He's not skinny or thin.  He's 5...he's gonna bulk up now. He's gonna get thicker.    I don't like his knees.  They look calf kneed  No life in his eyes.  Neck...I dunno but I don't like it.  I don't like his hoof care  steep croup  I want to say weak loins too.    I don't see a jumper or dressage prospect here.  I'm not even close to picking them out for this sport...but I don't see one in my eyes.  This guy is more cut out for police work, wagons, or parades.     He's what I've been looking for though :)    EDIT:  hey, don't go by what I said!  Get input by people like....HPTS7 or HPTSEQ.  They know their stuff.   by the way:  the add says FOALED: 2005  so he is just 4y/o  His temperament was a 5  Only $350!!???  HOLY SMOKES!!!!!!

THANKS HPTS!!!|`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	he's a gorgeous horse but he looks to heavily boned to jump..sorry.. :-(    Also, look at the state of those hooves...|`|8bTder08aa	My knee-jerk reaction when I saw the first two pictures was "Too much draft!", but the subsequent pictures look a little less "drafty."    I don't know.  Snowman, who is in the show jumping hall of fame, was supposedly a Percheron cross.  (I've heard other breeds have laid claim to Snowman's ancestory, but since I don't think anyone knew for sure it's all guess-work.  http://www.showjumpinghalloffame.net/ind...    Myself, this wouldn't be the kind of horse I would look for as a jumper, but horses regularly make fools of people who believe they can predict what a horse can/can't do before they try it. I think that's about all you can do:  start him over fences and see how it goes.  Good luck.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	yes draft x Tb can make great jumpers. here in Australia we x clydes and friesian with Tb's to get preformance horses. the most important thing is that you like the horse and think that he can do the job you want him to do. don't worry about the bulk, although he seems to have thrown the draft way. any horse can break down it's up to your management that keeps them sound.|`|sbB0TpGXaa	His problem is that he is light on muscle in the rear which is why everyone is saying he is thin.  He isn't thin.    However he has an anvil for a head and a very short neck attached high.    Overall I would say a 5 out of 10.  He doesn't look like the conformation will cause problems, but he he won't place very high.    I reserve lower numbers for horses that are likely to have problems associated with their conformation.  He doesn't appear that he will have.  He just won't be a top athlete.  Or for that matter much of an athlete at all.  Still he may perform ok at local shows.  Where the competition isn't as fierce.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	He's too big.. Like, his height is fine, but he's to bulky.. Ya know?    I wouldn't use a draft horse for jumping.    But it also depends on how high you plan on jumping.      &&OMG We rescued a PMU foal too ^^      Good job, if you're rescuing it. lol.|`|04QDV97kaa	He's beautiful. :)  I think he would do fine jumping. I'd recommend riding him over some jumps first to make sure though..  Best of Luck!  Lucy|`|7FQH8pcYaa	I have raised draft crosses, strictly for cattle, your horse in my thought he / she is just to big for jumping but that horse would make a great cattle horse long legs and stout body. Looks great.|`|Of0fyh2Saa	I agree with the others that's he's not built for jumping. Draft/TB's can be great jumpers but one thing that I've noticed is that the nicest crosses are Clyde/TB, and shire crosses tend to be bulky and not as good of movers/jumpers. I've seen some gorgeous looking Clyde crosses though. Best of  luck!|`|TTLIp8Beaa	despite what everyone is saying he could probably do great on smaller courses (3'6 and under)  my perchXtb is built the same and is now 25 years old and STILL jumping 3ft!    on the downside, he needs to be toned up, his feet desperately need to be trimmed, and he is also not broke to ride. he has a heavy head attached to a short neck. it shouldn't really effect his jump as long as you teach him who to stretch out over fences.     and also, to that idiot owner or rescuer or whoever actually owns him.. turning out your horse in a NYLON HALTER is STUPID. and too make it worse, it doesn't even fit him so they put a ROPE halter over top of it. GREAT horse care right there...|`|SzW9GmRsaa	There is no way that horse is four or five.  I'd be very interested to see inside its mouth; I'm guessing he's a two year old.  That's what my eyes are saying to me.  He's not thin, he's just immature.  It's like the difference between a 15 year old boy and a 25 year old rugby player.  It has nothing to do with gaining weight, it's about bulk of muscle and bone, and the only thing that can bring that on is a few more years and good management.    If he really is as old as four or five, he's a poor wee soul and needs to be turned away for at least two more years to mature.  I have a feeling that if he's given the time and opportunity, he may well turn into a nice horse.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Oh, I like him.  He looks like a big baby, I don't think he's finished growing yet and he has no muscle to speak of.  Looks more of a heavy hunter type than a competition jumper though.  His neck does looks short.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I'm with see arr harr - I don't think this boy is as old as 4, either.  I also see more clyde than I do shire, as he's quite leggy.  However, that would make sense if he was under the age of 4.  I wonder if the "shire" was added as a parent because they are more expensive and desireable than clydes.  It seems odd to me that a PMU farm would employ an expensive shire stud when they could get a clyde stud far more cheaply.    Conformationally I don't love him at all, especially his neck.  But he's a draft cross that was bred all willy nilly, so that's to be expected.  He is at least a nice color!    How high do you want to jump?  I think this guy would be OK for small shows and small jumping, but he probably won't ever be a high level contender.  If that's OK with you, then I say go for it.  The price is certainly right.|`|NiQAfFUPaa	My friend from Ireland said that warm bloods take longer and do not stay as sound as thoroughbreds.  Somewhere there is a balance, there is such a thing as to big.    The number one jumber ever was a throughbred.  A lot of thoroughbreds have good bone mass.   Also thing grand national, they can jump.      Draft horse does not ring agility to me.   The horse in the photo looks like he needs groceries (he is underweight) with giant bones. My guess is muscled up this horse could gain 200 lbs.    You want a horse that would be great a dressage, nice mover.          .|`|1c6TmvrZaa	Sorry, I know nothing about jumping. But I just had to say that he is an absolute beauty! Anyone who owns this horse is extremely lucky. His confirmation is gorgeous, as he is bulky and tall, but not fat awkward. I am not sure how he would do in the jumping circuit, but I can tell you one thing...if you even remotly ride Western he would be an amazing all around horse. He has the large sturdy looking feet and the muscle to be an athlete. I also think that he would be outstanding in Dressage. Depending on his gaits and the way he moves, you would have quite the looker and Drafts have the sweetest temperment. The thorougbred in him is definatly a good quality because he will have the endurance for anything. Sorry that I can help with the whole jumping thing. From what I do know, he looks a bit too bulky and he has pretty thick legs which I have heard causes problems with landing and joints etc. I hope that you choose well and even if he does not turn out to be a good jumper, keep in mind that he would be amazing all around. Even in English. Good luck!|`|pShlJVvraa	He will make a great western pleasure,  or even roping horse, where is he for sale at again;) Im in the market for a big blue beauty!|`|dt2DUI1uaa	I think he is gorgeous.  And you are right about draft / TB xs making great jumpers!  Beautiful, simply beautiful horse!|`|XsBIITFvaa	I'm a western rider, but I work at a jumping/dressage barn. The dressage trainer sent a ThoroughbredxClydsedale to the olympics, and there's a PaintxShire who does both dressage and jumps. He's about the size of the guy you were looking at, but she doesn't compete in the hunt ring. Only jumps for fun. He's mainly a dressage horse, but he doesn't seem to have any trouble jumping. If your looking for a competition horse, I'd go with a thoroughbred. They're amazing jumpers, and so versatile.     But the horse you have listed is beautiful. So unique. I don't think I'd pass him up...only 350? Wow. With some training you could easily profit off of that. Just something to think about...|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Wow that horse is thin!  With some extra padding and tone, he could probably make a safe and sane trail mount.  I've seen full drafts jumping, not high but they can safely do small courses.      Anyway, the only reason he doesn't *look* too heavy is because he's too thin.  Poor guy needs a couple hundred more pounds on him.  He's not bulky because he's hungry!  If he were fed he'd probably be too bulky for jumping.    His legs look well assembled, his back is a bit long (will make it hard for him to do tight turns).  He looks like a decent mover from the pics.  He could be very good at flat work but he doesn't look like he has the build to be a jumper.    Anyway, draft x tb horses don't make great jumpers, usually too heavy.  Get a real warmblood if you can afford one, like a hanoverian.  A draft TB mix isn't really a warmblood.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	The male is pretty but the breeding is not as easy as you maybe....its very dangerous because they could end up seriously hurt or even worst kill each other. You have to be really careful and keep open eye on the bettas so that you can quickly rescue them if they get out of control. The male is ready to breed when you see him building the nest, other than that do not place the female with him otherwise they might fight to death.

W02kTOqmaa	German Shepherds were originally called German Herding Dogs, but the name was too vague and broad, so they switched it to the German Shepherd Dog. The breed was originally bred for it's working ability, not it's looks. therefor several german herding dogs were used, and there wasn't a really set look to the breed. broad look, broad name. When a reliable physical standard started to form, a set name formed.    There was no specific reason DOG was left in the name. German shepherds were bred to be the perfect working dog, perfect herding dog, so they became the german shepherd dog. And no, there are no other "german shepherds" out there. there are other german herding breeds out there|`|nsJpNnm1aa	Probably so they won't get mixed up with human sheep herders (shepherds) who live in Germany...|`|ZuxmbhQ6aa	So does:    Bernese Mountain Dog  Pyrenean Mountain Dog  Old english Sheepdog  Chinese Crested Dog  Portugese Water Dog  Bulldog    It's just that rather than having a 'name' for the breed (ie Alsatian is an alternative name for the GSD) the breed title is more of a 'description'      Hope that makes sense.|`|NbvTyN7saa	No idea.  Been asking that question for decades.  I guess it was one of those things that stuck somehow and now is common place so people rarely question it anymore.  LOL!
GdBG4PGYaa	Maybe they just like it? Maybe it helps them sleep better, like people on their stomachs. My dog does this.

GdBG4PGYaa	Well yes, but first, anything you do to those things may not do anything to make your cat like them. Cats choose where they want to sleep, and your bed is warm, and has her favorite thing in it- YOU! :)    Make her bed warmer with a big soft blanket. Put a little cat nip in it. Sleep on a pillow, then put it in there. Put one of your t-shirts in there that you have worn recently.     Hope I helped! Good luck! =D|`|8nvesSFFaa	Well cats will sleep wherever they want to sleep.  But you could try putting her favorite things in her bed and maybe a t-shirt or something of yours that smells like you because she obviously wants to be with you all the time! After all she's just a kitten and your her momma! Babies never want to be away from their momma!  :)|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	Try wearing an old t-shirt for a day then putting it into her bed for her. Then put her in the bed. She may like it because it smells like you.
459JmuSxaa	Yes you spelled it right lol.    As long as you try to handle it every day it should be fine to leave your bird. It will need a large cage with lots of toys. Cockatiels love to shred and chew and need a lot of mental stimulation. Its best to buy several toys and change a few around every week because it will get bored and constantly chirp. I would not recommend getting a second bird if you want this one to be very tame. The first bird will focus on the other as a friend, and not on you and they may both become untamed. If you do get another bird you will need a separate cage. New birds should be separated for a month in case it has a disease that will end up killing both of them. It does happen. After the separation period you can move the cages side by side for awhile. You never put a second bird in a cage that has a bird already living there. The first bird will be territorial and possibly kill the other, they will fight at the least and neither will be happy. Not to mention unwanted breeding if you are not careful about the gender.  My recommendation would be to get one female cockatiel and leave it at that. females don't talk but they are known to be more friendly and cuddly. If you are ready for a second bird down the road, a separate cage is a must. Good luck with your new bird.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	An hour or two of dedicated time will be fine. if you can talk to him for a minute every time you walk by that would be good too.You can make a few minutes here and there . Get up 10 minutes early to feed and talk to him before you go to school. This is a big obligation you are taking on. If you don't want to make the effort don't get the bird. The bird will need you to tend to it whether you have nothing else to do or there is a big party going on.|`|S7Demh3Raa	that will be just fine. i have 2 birds who i think keep each other alive haha but i hardly ever play with them (sorry!) thought i would but dont really. their perfectly happy they chase eachother around the cage and play all the time. it will be just fine!|`|yUIeiQI1aa	Great answers have already been posted so as far as being able to afford one I would suggest you to go to craigeslist.com for purchasing your bird.  At least check it out you may not find what you want but sometimes people cannot keep there birds for some reason and you would be giving one a good home.  Sometimes they come with cages and toys talk to the owners so you can get an idea that the bird has been cared for.|`|8HpTium5aa	yea thats fine, my bird gets lots of attention on weekends and not so much on week days, i no how u feel of wantin it to be urs, im like that to *-*. what u gnna name it, i named my chichi|`|tYmqg6rgaa	the bird will be asleep by that time! if you don't have the time for a bird, don't get one!!|`|iMz85oCjaa	That should be enough as long as you make sure it gets at least an hour out of the cage every day. And make sure to have some toys in the cage so it can amuse itself during the day. They are very social birds though so make sure it gets attention everyday. My cockatiel got so lonely that he started plucking his feathers. My brother and sister tried to keep him company but he won't let anyone but me and my mom near him. After we got him a friend he was much happier though. :) So yes just make sure he gets some social interaction each day and time out of the cage!
TjLCnxkKaa	http://www.goldfishinfo.com/ailment1.htm...      "Cloudy Eye-    Cloudy eye can have many causes.  Look for signs of Velvet Disease, Ick, and Fish tuberculosis. However, sometimes this is caused due to bacterial infections.      Symptoms:     One or both eyes become cloudy, and take a whitish appearance. Fish may show signs of distress, and be off-color and behave abnormally.      Treatment:      Establishing the likely cause of the problem and treating it as soon as possible is the best way to prevent damage to your fish's nervous system.  The incidences of cloudy eye can be maintained by keeping the water quality in a good condition, and adding a small amount of aquarium salt to the water at water changes.  There are many good medications available at your local pet stores that deal with this problem. Follow the recommended accordingly"|`|GHpcc5iKaa	1. hes molting.  2. hes dying.  3. hes blind!    Best of luck! (By the way i put them in order of probability! Yay  1!)|`|Wt81sGW5aa	a  cloudy eye means he is blind
NwwhSpYAaa	Keeping your pet on preventative will stop the microfilarea immutus (baby heartworms) from growing into dirofilarea immuts (adult heartworms). However the already adults will be able to grow in the heart and have the chances to spreading into the lungs depending on how bad the infestation is already. Listen to the vet, they know what they're doing.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	The low dose of the preventative will not cause a massive die-off that would cause issues unless your dog is very heavily infested.  Listen to your vet.  If you have misgivings, phone your vet and talk to them about why they want you to keep her on the preventative.  They will be able to put your mind at ease.|`|9UttDvcsaa	If a dog has light infestation the best way to treat them is by giving them ivermectin (heartguard or iverhart) it will slowly kill the heartworms but it does take time.  If your dog has light infestation continue giving the pill once a month and get it rechecked in a year.  Coughing is normal and throwing up clear fluid is normal when the worms begin to die off.  Bleeding, throwing up blood and bad diarrhea is not normal and you should have them checked immediately.  Usually with light infestation there are few problems and your vet was correct in telling you to keep her on preventative.  If the infestation is moderate or heavy I would recommend getting the 2 part injections.  My rescue dog had to have the 2 part injections and after the treatment is heartworm free and in perfect health.  Another dog we came across had light infestation and is on preventative and has a very good prognosis. She will get rechecked in year.  Sentinel, Interceptor and other heartworm medications that don't contain ivermection could be very dangerous and maybe that is why your sister was worried.  Good Luck with your dog, I hope she is heartworm free in a year!      **Even if you don't have the money and your dog has mod heartworms your vet might suggest just keeping her on preventative, they will eventually die off and she will be healthy again and worm free.  Hang in there!    ***There is a risk of blood clotting with both forms of treatment.    ****The adult heartworms have a short lifespan actually, as you kill the young growth with the pill you stop the cylce, the adult worms die and the problem is solved.  I just had a very lenghly meeting with a vet over this.      ******the only advantage of the injection (which is 2 part and painful) is that it is definite and faster.  With a light infestation the pills do work and in some practices only what is recommended.  They do a blood test before prescribing heartworm preventative because they would not prescribe sentinel or interceptor to a HW positive dog and heavy infestation is risky for a slow kill method.  Good Luck!|`|ZJ2tem3baa	Your vet.  There are different grades of heartworm disease and obviously your vet feels that your dogs is not bad enough that he has to stop the preventative.  It will keep your dog from getting any worse til he can get proper treatment.  Basically it will kill the microfilariae (baby heartworms) so no new worms can grow in his heart.|`|YV1bOajXaa	I had heard if dogs have heartworm they should not get the preventative - I mean, that is why they give them the blood test before they give them the preventative in the first place.      Start the treatments and owe the vet - or apply for Care Credit.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Your sister.    If you continue giving the preventative, it will kill the worms.  Obviously, I know-shocker!.  That's a bad thing because once the worms die, the dog's system may have an allergic reaction to them.  A large, quick, fatal allergic reaction.     Clumps of dead worms, or blood clots caused by dead worms, may cause stroke.    Both these things are quickly fatal.    Waiting isn't great, but try to keep her as quiet as possible.  Stress on a worm filled heart may damage it, and break worms off causing the above problems.    Good luck|`|4hNRTWtDaa	They are both right, in a way.  Your vet would be the best to explain this to you.  There is more than one kind of medication available to prevent heartworm.  I am assuming your vet has advised you on what preventative to use.  Have they explained to you what the treatment consists of?  Don't put it off any longer than you have to.  Depending on how long your dog has had heartworm, you may run into more problems if you wait too long.  After the treatment, keep your dog on the preventative, EVERY month, forever.  They can get it over and over.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	How about checking into Care Credit financing and just getting the treatment started now? That's the best thing.
9QHwLQEraa	Bearded Dragons are a lot of fun! It was my first lizard and it was fun.

e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	Since the "Cats" forum has questions and answers from people all over the world, your chances are minute that you will hear from someone who knows about the area you specify.   I suggest you re-post your question under "Local Businesses." This way, you will be more likely to hear from someone who is familiar with the area and can point you in the right direction.   Good luck. I hope you find a good place for kitty.|`|kPVtIQDMaa	Go on line or in a phone book and look up shelters in your area.  You can call your local police too.  You will have to make phone calls and ask if they are a No Kill shelter.  The police might know.   When I find and catch strays, I have the police pick them up in a cage of mine that they bring back.  They take it to a local no kill shelter for free.  If I were to take it it would be $50 to $100.  They check to make sure it is not diseased and can be with people.  So far the cats have been adopted I have turned in.  Also look for TNR places...Trap...Neuter...Return.  They support strays and ferals living outdoors.  Probably not where you want to take this cat, but they can give you advice or places that are no kill shelters.  Good luck...would love to hear what you do!|`|dx9msaNzaa	I have no idea what state your in but I'd call an animal shelter and ask them. Also put up ads, lots of people want kitties.    on a side note-I'm looking for a companion for my kitten so if your around the Hunterdon county area in NJ I'd be willing to take her/him(?)
CdRlOsnyaa	no they will be okay turtle are very resistant to things like that it takes along time for them to get a disease
GSkA8wh9aa	A healthy cat should not have stuffiness. Did you mention this to your vet?  A few of my cats have a "thing" for plastic grocery bags. It's a love/hate thing. They love to lick them and lay ion them but I think the static it creates annoys them.|`|ZKlCzdjnaa	You really need to pick the bags up and put them  out of kitty's reach.  Even though cats do, as you mentioned, have an attraction to plastic, your Vet should have also informed you of such related various hazards. first,  the cat could possibly end up chewing off a piece of the plastic and dying as a result of a blockage in it's digestive system.  Second, as we all know kitties get very wild during playtime... and getting stuck as a result of being  twisted up inside the plastic bag could possibly lead to suffocation........a horrific CATtastrophy that could have easily been avoided.   Finally,  you don't know what kind of chemicals may have either been used to treated the plastic bag or have accidentally been spilt or sprayed on the bags --(and your kitty is licking these bags???)  This last scenario is an unlikely  chance but with my babies lives any chance is too far great a chance for me.) So for their sake and yours---please pick up the bags!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Today's kitty has so many choices in toys, treats, and gadgets alike that  it completely baffles me why something so potentially harmful could continue to amuse and fascinate many of both kitty and their obviously oblivious yet devote and loving owners as well.
w1lh1INHaa	Actually, I would suggest your mom get some therapy. Phobias can be debilitating, and they do not get better with age. In fact, they usually get worse.    A phobia of animals minimizes your mom's world and what she can do and where she can go in life. Some therapy would do your mom a world of good. She is trying very hard to please you by letting you have pets, and she evidently doesn't want you to have the same phobias. So, she now needs to do something for herself, and seek some therapy or support groups that can help her overcome the phobia. Sometimes just getting to know an animal and letting it get close will help, but sometimes it takes more.|`|7e1XN1Jeaa	Maybe you should tell your mom that the kitten is nice! She will want to explore eventually! She'll probably won't want to stay in one place forever! Hope it works out for you! :)|`|AA12322387	The cat will eventually learn that there is more to the world than just your room and she will want out...as she should.

S9B8Fr4daa	Oh, your in for it! Your about to be 'PUGGED'!  Some things that you should know about a pug from my own experiences as a pug owner.  -Patience..and lots of it.  Pugs are known to be difficult to potty train, but with a VERY regular schedule, and walks every 1-2 hours..They should catch on quickly..  -Energy..  While you don't have to exercise a pug as much as you do most other breeds, you still have to give them LOTS of play time with you..Or they'll destroy your house in what i'd like to call....Pug tantrum style.  ((NOT pretty lol))  -For the first 2-3 YEARS this little one is going to give you a run for your money in the energy department..You'll need LOTS of it to make it through this rambunctious stage.  -A crate.  I believe in crate training..The younger you start--the better.  Sets some boundaries in your relationship with them.  -LOTS of lovin'!  This baby is going to DEMAND you give them as much if not all of your attention.     -A boat load of toys.  Or else your shoes or panties will be their next option.   - I would recommend stainless steel or plastic bowls...I've had several broken dishes because the pugs scoot and roll them around when they empty them out..  Also..a LEASH from day one that you have it...Pugs LOVE to run off sniffin things..The next thing you know they'll be down the road and under the neighbors fence in horse poo or something lol.    Last but certainly not least...  Be ready to fall in love so fast you don't even know what happened.. Pug antics are the greatest..and they have such great personalities!    Well thats all I've got for now.  Good luck and congrats!      Add: Kenfolks--Dont' come on here pushing some puppy mill breed on people! There is no such thing as a 'hybrid bug'  That is just a crapily bred  boston terrier pug mix.  Which is talking even MORE problems than a pug alone has.    And it is NO guarantee that ANY dog is going to be healthy--OR unhealthy.  You should not OWN a dog if all you care about is health issues that MAY or MAYNOT come up.   Yes--Pugs shed alot...Just like any other dog.    My pugs shed just as much as my hounds, and my hounds shed just as much as my rottweilers..So your point is invalid.  And never ONE time have I had to sweep OR vacuum 3 times in one day.  I sweep one time in the morning and MAYBE one time at night..Has more to do with keeping dust under control that dealing with 'pug hair'/|`|HcR3TEhpaa	Dont DO IT!!!!   They "SHED" Horribly  unlles you like to vaccum your floors 3x a-day and love showering the Vet. with cash, dont even think about a Pug!

I do not get sad about puppy mills...I get angry and pissed off.  And what is even more anger-inducing is that while "responsible" breeders spend so much time pissing about possible breeding laws/mandatory spay and neuter laws and such, they spend ZERO effort on putting away puppy mills for good.

I8Tahe4Jaa	I said "Horse-y" meaning Horse Related. It's something my sister and I say a lot to each other in everyday conversation, so no, it doesn't bother me, and yes, I do know that there is a distinction.     And just so you know, I don't refer to my equestrian friend as a "horsey". No need to be so short.    If we're going to get into the nitty gritty, I don't particularly like the words 'like seriously' in every sentence, either. Let me give you an example; "Like seriously we are all old enough to know the correct term for a horse so why cant we use it?"|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	No.  Questions like this, however..|`|qdtU1Q1Laa	Haha yes, it does bug me a little when they can't spell, but sometimes they're just typing too fast and don't catch it.|`|eWVqUjtYaa	wow man seek help|`|lTeXIjpOaa	as long as i can understand what the person is trying to say i dont mind, but when someone posts a question and it is so uncomprehensible that you have absolutely no idea what they are saying then it is annoying|`|QTT9380Yaa	Totally! You are supposed to be 12 to be on here anyways so people really need to grow up and start acting their age.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Not so much the horse thing, but definitely the baby talk and incorrect spelling. I mean, they expect us to help them, yet they cannot use proper grammar for the life of them so you can't even understand what they're asking.    The worst is when someone tries to put themselves off as professional, or like they know what they're doing, but they still use horrible grammar. It's like come on, you try and tell us that you own 3 horses, a champion jumper, yet you're asking why your horsey is doing this in the most incoherent way possible.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Yes. I find the bad spelling the worst. It completely defeats the purpose of communicating.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	For being so mad, I'd think you'd capitalize your "I" 's hahahaha    but I think it's more funny... once I answered a girl who's question started out, "help !! i need edvis!!!"

Ugh|`|MBwln1m7aa	I get bugged when I have to try and decipher what people have written. Learn how to string a sentence together!! This this also has spell check - use it!|`|u1HahCoqaa	Yup.....I'm kinda a freak about that. Although it's sad that there are alot of adults on here who cannot spell, or form coherent sentences, as well as a 15 year old high schooler. So I call them on that.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	Sometimes - it really depends on the context of the question.    Asking about horsey gifts for people etc is one thing but someone trying to ask a serious health related question that starts with "my horsey is poorly" is really not doing themselves any favours.|`|WxACyBbgaa	No, every one makes mistakes including ME and YOU, Mis perfect,maybe you should start capitilizing your I`ssince your so perfect.People like you is what bugs me they think they are so perfect.|`|5LGIrOjVaa	Not really.|`|mnXxJtqmaa	No.|`|aJRP6WWYaa	It don't bug me.|`|pYdtTEzfaa	Yes!

I have a dog i call boober(her name is misty) and I call my rabbits my buns. I would never use it online when its just as easy to say dog or rabbits lol|`|EaNjIhoQaa	The misspelling bothers me a bit but not too much. Saying horsey instead of horse...I do it!|`|9BwQMXycaa	bad spelling, using the WRONG terms and ESPECIALLY...    USELESS QUESTIONS!!!!!!|`|IbbQK960aa	It don't bother me.|`|wM8qRy5laa	Sometimes because it makes them look unprofessional.|`|04QDV97kaa	I know that sometimes it can be annoying, but I try to overlook those things and just help them in what they asked for help for.  I know when people only use half a word and replace an "s" with a "z" or anything like that it can even sometimes be hard to read. :)   It really doesn't matter though how people type or spell as long as everyone else can figure it out.|`|9zzuz66Kaa	I think baby talk's okay, depending on how their using it...   like if they're telling a story, or something like that.  But what REALLY bugs me is when people put 'u' in stead of 'you' and 'r' for 'are'... it's just really annoying to me... and dis and dat... I seriously want to punch them through my computer...  haha|`|at7LXbEfaa	Meh.  i dont really care  i call my boy a horsey  and im 14/|`|NwhrZt9Saa	The spelling bothers me. But saying horsey does not. But I hate how tons of people ask this same question-"How do I make my parents buy me a horse". I think that is really rude, they spend enough money on you. And you should be grateful. Not asking there parents for something huge like that if they can't afford it.|`|yScsvA4Taa	Depends
KEYgd73saa	As you're aware, it needs a much bigger tank.  If you can get your friend to buy a 10 gallon tank, that'd be a good start, but he/she should really be looking at a 20+.  Other than that, all I can really recommend is frequent (every few days in that tank!) water changes and a diet high in vegetable matter (algae wafers, blanched spinach, lettuce, zucchini, cucumber, etc.).    Unless you can definitively identify that the fish has pop eye, I'd really not recommend treating for anything-- pop eye can be caused by kidney failure, and adding meds to that will only lead to toxic blood.  Water changes are, once again, the best thing you can do.  Consider adding aquarium salt, though, as Mollies do much better at raised salinities (all the way up to full marine conditions).

bDPVRtCNaa	I'm sorry I don't have a video. When I siphoned my fry tank I used the smallest siphon I could find, and moved it very carefully through the tank. I kept it close to the bottom so that I vacuumed up just what wasn't eaten to keep it from decaying in the tank.    The frozen food is a bit too big. The microworm cultures are really easy, and not expensive at all. It's worth it to use live foods. Store bought foods ruin water quality.

He just stares at me like "I sat wheres treat"  I feel for ya and hope you get an answer that will work for me.|`|CNer40Xhaa	Well, you should of thaught her earlier. Chihuahuas can be easily trained early. When she sits, say sit. She should catch on eventually. Teach her to stand by something dog trainers call "catching a behavior". Cross your arms with a treat in one hand. Wait until she stands up. Say stand and treat her. Then when you want to train her more, you can communicate whether you want her to sit or stand to start.    It seems easier to train cute tricks when the dog likes what it's doing. Here's an expierience of mine:  Keeshond loves belly rubs. So I taught her to play dead. When she rolled over halfway for a belly rub, I said bang, and told her she was a good girl. (this dog attention motivated. I wouln't recommend this method with your dog) She cought on FAST. She would do that for anything after that.|`|hPhQkT79aa	Say sit and then push her back until she sits down   If she did it give treats  Continuously repeating it until she gets it|`|0TvSFiVMaa	get a treat, make it so she looks at it. Then slowly, bring the treat up over her nose and over her head. she'll probably keep on looking at the treat. if she jumps on you give her a sign of negativity or a "NO" Try again and if that doesn't work. you need to get a clicker. clickers are good things not bad you might wanna just make her know a clicker is good by dispensing treat whenever the is on the ground 4 paws all on. If you too lazy to get the clicker just give her a sign of positive stuff when she doesn't jump on you. when all feet are on the ground give her a treat. do that for a while then try the nose thing and up over the head thing again. i don't know if your dog will do so but... ya|`|5Ho7uxMVaa	First, let me say,  Chihuahuas may seem dumb, but they are actually smart when they are trained well. Not saying that you are wrong, but I'm just saying in general. What you do is wait for to get up. Then say sit. If she goes nuts over the treats, just take a few out of the box, and put them in your pocket. Then say   "Sit" (Put her name in front of the command).  Then when she sees the treat, she will sit, if that is what she does when she sees treats. But, what she is doing is good behavior in some ways. If she won't get up. While she is sitting, say the command, and reward her.

KeevlZnTaa	It is very difficult to bond with adult gliders, so if you have an adult than it is going to take time. You need to literally wear them for at least a few hours per day. You have to get something called a bonding pouch and during the day while the glider is sleeping, you wear the pouch around your neck. This gets them used to your smell. Don't bother them while they are in there, just wear the pouch, you want them to feel secure in the pouch.    When you are not wearing them, you need to spend time just sitting with them. Get a small tent, and go in there with the glider. Do not try to touch them, or pet them, just let them jump around, and on and off of you. By not touching them, it lets them know that if they come near you, you will not grab at them, or try to touch them. You need to build a respectful relationship and have trust before even trying to really touch them.    Bonding with an adult glider is a slow and sometimes frustrating process. It can take months to years to develop a relationship with an adult glider. The key is patience, and understanding. be aware that you may never bond with them, b/c that is a possibility. Time builds trust, so don't try to rush it.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Never owned sugar gliders before, but maybe this will help:  http://www.sugarglider63.com/bonding.htm

bDPVRtCNaa	This is not abuse. I am just answering your question.    1. Your tank is too small to support the fish you currently have. Adding more to the tank really isn't an option.  2.

Do you realize what goes into declawing? It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.    Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't put your furniture over your cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

Read this about declawing:    http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...|`|Jguzosm2aa	Preferably, never.     Declawing is a traumatic, painful and debilitating procedure which can be compared to having your fingers cut off at the first knuckle. To remove the claw, part of the toe is removed. It is not unheard of for cats to experience lasting pain, requiring medication throughout their life. Should your cat get lost, it will not be able to forage for food, defend itself, or climb to escape danger. You may intend to keep them indoors - which is good - but this doesn't mean they will never manage to get out.    Scratching posts may be enough to solve the problem. You can even buy them to fit against the corner of furniture. for climbers, save up and buy a cat tree. If this is not enough, nail caps are another option. They're relatively cheap, come in packages which last more than one use, and are harmless to the cat. They will wear off, so your cat is not doomed should it get outside. They also allow enough grip that a cat can still hunt with ease and defend itself just fine.    There are a number of medical and behavior problems associated with declawing. Declawed cats may experience lasting pain where the toes were removed, and the pain of scratching or digging in litter can be associated with the litter box itself, prompting cats to use soft material such as carpet, clothes or furniture to relieve themselves. Declawed cats, having lost the defense of their claws, are known for biting, and hard, in warning instead of a little swat. The removal of the toes and claws prevents them from getting vital exercise from stretching. Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. It is not uncommon for join problems to develop in cats who are declawed. Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints.    The costs really outweigh the benefits, and it's an expensive procedure that cannot be reverse if you change your mind. You wouldn't want the tops of your fingers removed, and neither does your cat.|`|8uqbNrICaa	There are only a very few reasons to declaw a cat!    The ONLY reason we had my mother's cat declawed was she couldn't bear not to have him and her skin was so tender, painful to touch and brittle so any scratching bled like crazy.    It is a traumatic operation, and one that can't be undone. The cat can never be let outside again. He will start biting to show he doesn't like what you're doing as he can't scratch.

Permits involve a lot of screening and cost money along with being "surveyed" meaning the permit giver people will search your living space and surrounding area to make sure 1.) you have the ability to care for such an animal 2.) the environment is safe 3.) you have the money to care for the monkey 4.) you have a habitat like the one it comes from to insure it being happy and becoming depressed and 5.) you have the time. Monkeys are very social animals. I'm not telling not to further your want for a cute little monkey but they do take time, a lot of money because they are exotics and if your monkey were to get sick you would have to go to a Zoo vet special which alone will cost you a kidney to be sold. I realize you have done your research but what you need to look into now is finding a place that will grant you a permit. Before you go searching for a cute monkey to buy you need to get a permit and make a living space for the monkey, then you should worry about where to get the monkey and such. It's not cruel to own a monkey, but it is cruel to own a monkey and then not take care of it or not give it the proper requirements for a healthy life. Good luck
13xTQ5lsaa	Knowing the type of fish is really important to deciding the best way to go.  Can you try to describe them?    Don't use soap to clean the tank - the residue can kill the fish and it will kill all the beneficial bacteria causing the tank to have to cycle all over again (very dangerous for the fish).  You don't want to aim for a perfectly clean tank right off the bat.  Cleaning the tank to pristine conditions immediately after it has been that way for 6 months can shock the fish (rapid changes in water chemistry are bad).    To move them - try getting "virgin" buckets - one that has not had any chemicals put in it.  Siphon water from the tank into the buckets and put the fish in them.  Drain as much water from the tank as you can - and move the tank to where you want it.  Fill it half-way with dechlorinated water that is the same temperature (and if you can the same PH) as the water in the buckets.  Add as much water from the buckets as you can to the tank while still leaving water in the buckets for the fish.  Once you can no longer add water from the buckets (there isn't enough left for the fish in the buckets), put the fish back in the tank and top it off with the remaining bucket water.    The faster all this done - the better (more likely that the good bacteria will survive).    Bring the water conditions in the tank back to "good" gradually by doing a 20% water change daily.    *** Edit *** - How old is the tank?  If you decide to move the tank with a lot of water still inside, it can stress the silicone seams and start leaking.  Some people take that chance - but if the tank is over a few years old - I wouldn't chance it.    *** One more addition *** - what I wrote pertains to freshwater fish.  Make sure the fish aren't marine or brackish (if they are - you'll have to get the salinity/specific gravity right as well.)|`|5knGTf5paa	ya...syphin the water/rocks, and scrub the algae off the glass and  decorations if their are any. find out with kind of filter it is and go to wal mart or pets mart and get new attachments for the filter(new active carbon and sponge).  to move it to you apartment just empty half the water and have you and a friend carefully move it to your place and just fill it back up with water. and as to what that other kid said...do NOT clean the tank with soapy water.. you dont even have to take the fish out to clean the tank just take out about half of the water and scrub it.. and if you do take the fish out to clean it still dont use soap it will kill the fish.|`|s80ED7Ygaa	Please post a picture up.

Ever, The soap can not be rinsed out!  DO NOT USE BLEACH! if there are fish in the tank.  DO NOT USE VINEGAR! if there are fish in the tank.    Make note of the brand and size and go to the pet store and pick up some new fiter cartrige and a gravel vac.    To clean the tank take out all of the decor wash in Plain hot tap water.   drain off have of the water and replace with fresh tap water that you have added declorinator and make sure the water temp is as close as you can get it to the water in the tank.     To clean the walls of the tank use a brand new scrubber sponge that you have rinsed in hot tap water for 3 mins.    Clean the gravel using the gravel vac.    To move the fish place them in a large bucket(5G) with a lid...keep bucket with fish at the same temp as the tank was at.    Do not wash the gravel plain tap water... you need the good bacteria.
qgeI6Chxaa	If you decide to get a puppy from a breeder, make sure it's a reputable one. Look up the breed's parent club on the AKC website to find a list of good breeders. Quality doesn't come cheap (depending on the breed, the puppy will generally cost between $750-2000) but in the long run you'll save on vet bills because the puppy will be healthier. Many breed clubs also run rescue programs.    Adopting is great, but it's a gamble. Especially with mutts, you have no idea what to expect in terms of size and personality. You also don't know the dog's background, so there could be serious health or temperament issues later. If you want to adopt, make sure that the dog is a good choice. It's okay to be picky and not just take the first cute dog you see.|`|bIaywrBCaa	If you want a specific breed and want it young, your best bet is to go to a breeder. Just make sure you check the breeder out thoroughly. Get references from past buyers and the breeder's vets as well. If anyone will not give you that info, go somewhere else.|`|Jguzosm2aa	Why not compromise by going through a breed-specific rescue. You can find the breed you want and still provide a home to a dog in need.|`|Y4pfVX10aa	go to a a specific dog breed rescue site|`|cdXMQai8aa	Get yourself your own dog from a breeder and donate money to the pound every month =]    Who noes how those dogs will turn out, im sorry.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	How about adopting a dog through a breed rescue or a foster-based rescue organization?  Dogs that are in breed rescues/foster-based rescues tend to be more thoroughly evaluated than dogs from the shelter because they are usually living in a home-environment in the foster home rather than in a kennel environment (which can create some behaviors that aren't really typical of that individual) like a shelter or pound.    Whether you go through a reputable breeder or a rescue/shelter/pound you're still able to train the dog yourself.  All dogs need training regardless of their age or where they come from and training is the best way to build a bond with a new dog.  Also, dogs of ALL ages are in need of new homes.  If you have your heart set on a puppy then you can still get a puppy, even a young puppy, through a rescue situation.  You just might have to be a little more patient because puppies are more quickly adopted than older dogs and they do tend to come in a bit less frequently than adolescent and adult dogs.  Filling out an adoption application and getting it pre-approved even if the organization doesn't currently have any dogs that you are interested in will speed things up and help you a lot if you are looking for a puppy.    While all shelter dogs are going to come with some sort of "baggage," this does NOT necessarily mean that they are going to be more work than a puppy from a good breeder.  The vast majority of dogs in need of new homes have never been abused and are there simply because their previous owners did not understand the commitment that a dog needs.  Most of their "issues" are simple training fixes (like pulling on the leash or jumping up on people) and something that you're going to have to work on with any puppy anyway.  The only disadvantage is that they have had longer to get into the habit than a puppy.  But as long as you are consistent then they will quickly learn how to behave properly.|`|a4qyasMHaa	well i know how you feel we bought 2 dogs from a breeder so..i can imagine how you are torn. Breeders most of the time will be purebreds (depending on what breed you are wanting) . Rescue centers are mostly mutts but if you like that then it really is up to you|`|MLC97M1Baa	Go to the pound and get a sense of all of the dogs, puppies, etc. There are also breed specific rescues you coud look into.|`|bMYv0fBHaa	There is no "better" option, providing and assuming that you are going to a reputable breeder, and not going to a "breeder" that is really a money-hungry backyard breeder, or a puppy mill.    Since you have some time (which is excellent), I would suggest you do some hardcore research. Evaluate what you are looking for in a dog--size, temperament, drives, EVERYTHING. Once you have it down to a select few of breeds, get very specific on the research. Check out the kennel clubs for the breed, talk to owners in the area (if possible), go to shows (if possible). Make sure you know diseases, find good breeders (and talk with them to see if it is a good fit), know drives, and are 100% sure you are ready to make the major commitment to this breed.    If, somewhere in the process you decide that owning a specific breed with specific traits and drives isn't what you want, or that you are unsure if you can keep up with a driven dog, or that you just don't care about having a purebred, you can of course adopt. You can even check out mixes of the breed you are interested in.    There is also breed-specific rescue, which is saving a life AND getting (for the most part) a purebred dog.|`|Yw1zIYK6aa	Why dont you go to a breed specific rescue? You're getting a purebred from a rescue! Everyone wins!!!   Dr. Dog|`|VxKH7KHmaa	I have always had purebreds from breeders, and my one shelter dog turned out to be the best dog I have or will ever own.     Usually most shelters are pretty good about matching the right dog to you and your lifestyle, and do behavior tests and history screenings on the dogs before being adoptable.     If your really concerned about not knowing what to expect, I suggest adopting a puppy or young dog that is more of a clean slate when it comes to training and already developed bad habits.|`|sMBuotwZaa	You should take a step back and look at what you plan on doing in the next few years at least.      Where are you going to be living, what type of activities are you going to be doing, and what not...    If you have a pretty clear Idea of what you are going to be doing, Then you need to thinks of the needs of different types of dogs that will fit your lifestyle.  If its pretty flexible, then a mix from the pound may be ok, especially if you have a lot of time to work with it (they tend to have baggage,and need extra attention to reinforce good things in their minds)    If you have a specific set of needs, or lifestyle you may want to look into a specific breed that best fits you.  Also this is good if you want predictiablity on size and what to expect as the dog ages.    Breed Specific Rescue is a good way to go if you want specific traits and Qualities in a dog. And it still allows you  to give an orphan a home.    Its good to be cautious and concerned.  The reason we have so many pound puppies, is because people don't research what best fits them and buy the wrong dog, and then get rid of it when it doesn't "work out"    Good luck, and I hope that you find the pup of your dreams.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Do you have small children? I would adopt a dog personally since I have small children. I think it is more of a risk to them. Not that bad things always happen but I would feel very bad if I put my children in danger by helping a dog.  I guess if you have a specific breed in mind that fits your lifestyle the best go with that. If you are open and easy with knowing you could get a dog with more issues adopt. Adoption is a great thing just not for everyone. Good luck.|`|iLrp65oXaa	I would get a dog from a breeder if I am able to get another dog in the future.  I adopted and it became fairly clear that my rescue did not temperament test my dog.  He has had increasing aggression issues (from day one) and I have already spent hundreds on trainers and behaviorists.  I can't even take him anywhere anymore because he lunges and snaps at other dogs and people.  Because he is become dog aggressive I may never be able to get another dog, which had always been the plan.  I live in constant fear that he will bite someone and I will be liable.    If you adopt make sure you know everything possible about the dog and that the shelter temperaments tests your dog.  If they don't do this many dog behaviorists will temperment test pound dogs for a fee.  It is worth it.|`|0TvSFiVMaa	Just to be safe. Go with the pure breed because pound dogs might look sad and cute in the cages but how would you know how the past owner treated it. So it could hurt or disobey you.|`|FjpLk2v8aa	i would get one from the pound..iv gotten 4 from the pound and the are so loving...they take a little more work but its worth it|`|eHidj8pcaa	GO TO THE POUND.  so many dogs are put down every year because they weren't adopted.  please, save a dog. :)|`|AA12322387	For some reason you seem to have a warped view on shelter dogs.

You can search under breeds, age, locations. I would start with a rescue group who has the dogs in  homes and can evaluate the dogs and find one that is best for you.

They're also extremely loyal. I don't see a problem with going to the pound because plenty of shelters have specific breeds. Also if you know that you like a particular breed don't neglect to see if that breed will fit into your lifestyle. For example, sure labs are great dogs, but they need lots of exercise. Someone who is going to be out and about without being able to devote lots of time to more energetic dogs shouldn't get that breed. Also I've had plenty of rescued dogs and they're wonderful and grateful companions! Good luck with your search!|`|3kqsbpIbaa	While some think breeders are the way to go.  You have to make sure they are reputable.  You may not know what you are getting.  There are a lot of dogs that come from breeders that have major health issues.  I am not saying that getting a dog from a breeder is bad, just make sure you do your homework if that is the way you want to go.  I would suggest the pound.  We have had several dogs from animal shelters and they have all been wonderful companions.  Just make sure you take the time to visit the dog and make sure the breed(s) are a good fit for your lifestyle.|`|y6QtbuHMaa	well, usually dogs were abused and went through some bad times at a pound, but now they might be taken better care of it, however its a little more expensive.    a breeder is okay, but they arent as well taken care of and in reality you might be paying mroe for all the rabie shots and getting fixed, e.c.t.    so i would get it from a pund becasue you come be saving a dogs life, they might not have enough room so they might put one to sleep. :(|`|YdI0TLczaa	I've had pure breeds and mutts. Honestly, one of my favorite dogs was a mutt, and was super smart. I have found that mutts/strays make wonderful pets. They are so used to being neglected that when they do find an owner who really loves them, they become your best bud. I also found that they seem to have fewer problems, especially skin problems. I vote for the shelter. I would recommend walking through the shelter. Usually there will be one dog that will catch your eye and you will feel an instant connection with. The feeling of adopting is phenomenal. I would recommend getting one who is under a year old (easier to train). Although, if you want a calmer dog, you might check out some of the older dogs.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	Breed specific rescue is good. However, it depends on the breed too.. Huskies, Dobermans, Dalmatians for examples can be very tricky especially if you are first time owner. I would read up. There is nothing wrong going to a breeder.. those dogs need homes too. My first dog was from SPCA (hound mix), my second one from a breeder (doberman) due to the temperament and health issues. People say I could of gone to the SPCA but it was a personal choice and I don't regret him. I know his pedigree and was capable of proper training and he needed a home too!  Good Luck|`|FDZNJXxcaa	there are often pure breed dogs at the pound that needs homes too you just have too look and mixed breed dogs often have less health issues that the pure breed dogs do... and if you get a dog from the pound they know you saved them and are forever loyal...|`|cbWWqqDiaa	I no you'll think getting a dog from a breeder it will be cute and perfect but personally i think pound dogs and cross breeds turn out to be more loyal and you will be saving its life.
tPGxPDvBaa	Doesn't sound like mange.  Sounds more like she has been scratching near her ear instead.  Check her ears to be sure they are clean.  It is possible for them to injure themselves like you said w/o hardly blood. The no hair on her feet sounds like allergies - either food or environment.   You should research into switching foods to see if it clears up.|`|nctxHm8Qaa	GO TO THE VET.  It isn't rocket science and we're not psychic.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	A vet really needs to see your dog.  Not being able to see what you are talking about makes it hard for us to help you.  We could take wild guess & we can tell you what it might be but the Vet is the one that need to see the spots & do skin scrapings to see if it is mange or a dermatitis, it could also be hormonal.    Demodex  Sarcoptic    Are the two different types of mites that cause mange.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mange
Bm3vyuNpaa	Look, you don't need to take her to the vet! I f the signs they told you about are showing, she'll probably give birth soon, but what you need to know is...  1) when 3-5 days old (Babes) start to interact with them.  2) put a piece of toilet paper in a corner of the cage before she gives birth.  3) They should open their eyes and grow fur and hear 1-5 months.  4) separate girl and boy when 5 months  5) separate dad before gives birth.    :o) good luck!!!|`|uKDGtBHgaa	well, was the other mouse male? are her nipples inlarged? has she benn  pregnate before? if her nipples are inlarged and she is fat, you have a pretty big chance of her being pregnate. but she might have a health problem. wait a week and if these signs continue take her to a vet.|`|3Sc1szTvaa	Make sure it's not just her cheeks. If it isn't she may be pregnant. You may need to go to a small animal vet. Do not wait a week like she says. They give birth 4-5 days after getting pregnant. Please take her to the vet.

An easy way is to get a tape measure and a pencil. Stand the dog next to a wall. Put the pencil levelly across the top of the dog's withers (the highest point of the shoulder blades, which are located just behind the neck). Make a tiny mark on the wall with the tip of the pencil. Then measure the height of the mark. This is the dog's height at the withers, which is how dogs are measured.
rrFbQZzIaa	as said, it depends on where you go but i know who has the cheapest supplies where I live so my prices are going to be lower than others. If you are getting a baby, you'll want a 20G long. If you're getting a adult, atleast a 40g breeder. There's about $20-$30 price difference between the two w/ a 40g probably going for $80-$100. You would need two light fixtures and you can buy these at walmart for under ten dollars each. A coil UVB bulb will run you around $25-$35 and a heat bulb $5-$10. You can do w/out a water dish, just by a spray bottle to mist the cage, $2, and some bedding, $6, and something for the dragon to hide in and possibly climb on, $20-$30 and you're set. The dragon itself will cost around $20 to a couple hundred but a average price would be around $70 for a normal baby dragon. Calcium and vitamin dust will run you $15-$20 and a small dish would be about $5. Again this is going to depend on where you live and where you buy from but you're looking at $200-$400. This does not include weekly food or enclosure for the crickets or other accessories that could be useful or needed. If your house gets cold for example, you may need a night lamp.|`|kBek6QCLaa	for the best queality for the bearded dragon depending on how much money you buy the tank from but the tank and all the accessories will at least cost 300-400    then the bearded dragon, which varies upon an adult and a baby and juvenile, could be anywhere to 20-100, which are usally baby and juveniles, adults cost more|`|RwQmN7Reaa	It depends on where you buy your beardie and supplies from and how old he/she is. I got my little girl for $70 but she came from a friend of mine, if you get one of a larger color variety or from a certain breeder they will be more expensive. I have seen them anywhere from $20-$100+. The tank can sometimes be more expensive than the lizard itself depending what size you start with. The full grown beardie will need a 45-50 gallon tank to live comfortably (larger is better but you can start small and upgrade) brand new they can be as much as $300+, also depending on the store. A good place to check is someplace like craigslist or possibly ebay if you feel comfortable buying from that kind of sight. You would also need food and water dishes which don't need to be anything complicated you could just use shallow bowls, a heat lamp, a natural sun lamp, substrate, calcium powder, and other foods, both live and plenty of vegetables and fruits. The initial cost of the beardie along with tank and the accessories not including food would probably be somewhere around $200+ depending on the specific brands and exact items you buy and where they come from.|`|JkrVo263aa	Well at local pet stores bearded dragons cost around 60$ and you will need a BIG tank, minimum of 20 gallon for just a baby. Im not exactly sure how much the tank will cost. bearded dragons need the right lights, there is one light that has all the needed lights included. That lightbulb is 80$ and then a holder for the lightbulb is about 15$. that's about 155$ together. Plus you will need all the food. it depends where you go, but i get 24 crickets for 10 cents. You will also need something for the bearded dragon to climb on and you will need sand for the bottom of the cage. im sorry i don't know what that costs. If u shop really cheap u might be able to spend 180$, ouch sorry  that's the reason i didn't end up getting a beardie, hope this helped!
qdtU1Q1Laa	I've seen some pretty good jumpers who are partially blind.  It may take some extra work, but I don't see why he couldn't jump.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	That would be really hard, but I know of a few horses that jump and are blind in one eye.    When you can only see out of one eye, you have no depth perception... Something that's critical in jumping.    I say, go for it. Take it a LOT slower than you would with a horse that can see. Make sure you give obvious cues when you get to a jump. And if it doesn't work out, don't push him. Just try something else.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Difficult, dangerous, possible.  Start over poles on the ground.  Work your way up.  You can't really go too high, because he could injure himself.  Be really careful!|`|QTT9380Yaa	I think you could train him to do that but you would have to go REALLY slowly with him. I know a horse that is half blind and still jumps 2'6 (he used to do grand prix). It will just take a ton of patience and you really need to go at his comfort level.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	I used to ride a 16.2 mare who was totally blind in one eye. Her owner used to go eventing with her and when she retired from that she did hunting and schoolwork.  She was brilliant.  He needs to learn to trust you.|`|ajj7ATyAaa	It's possible.  But unless you have LOTS of experience training green horses to jump, I would not recommend.    Having vision in only one eye really can screw with depth perception, which is very important.  He could have trouble judging where to take off, and without his full sight, a couple good knockdowns could scare him out of it.|`|xg4MK2JCaa	Well, I see no problem why he can't jump o.o  So he probably can c:  Although, I'm not a professional rider or anything like that...so don't take my advice lol|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	I once knew a horse who was blind in one eye and he could jump exes... but we never took him higher than that, so yes!    I'd be EXTREMELY careful though!!!!!|`|9BwQMXycaa	well for one, he is only a quater blind.  He can still see out of his right eye a bit and completely in his left eye...right?   well I had a horse once, she only had one eye(she had to get the other one removed because someone decided to poke it with a metal rod.....) and I rode her over 4 foot courses...jumper....  there are NO reasons why a half blind horse can't jump.  Just make sure he is completely desensitised and not spooky whatsoever and he listens to all your aids perfectly and hell be jumping in no time!  :-D    good luck!   hope i've helped!|`|jQvT6k7raa	People who are saying that it's incredibly dangerous...  Well, they are wrong. They obviously do not understand how much different a horses vision is from ours. Humans tend to rely on sight above the rest of our scenes. it is part of being a predator animal. Horses, rely mostly on their incredible hearing. Honestly, not being able to see clearly is something horses are born with...losing a little more of it is tragic, but not really a big deal. What would be INCREDIBLY problematic would be a deaf horse, but anyway, back to the question. Unless the horse is entirely blind, I can't imagine it would make much difference!  It sounds odd, but really. Think about it:  A horses eye's are placed on the side of his head, and he has a blind spot directly in front of him. Even a horse with perfect vision looses sight of the jump as he approaches it.   Most jumping horses really don't know what they are jumping over. what they really pick up on is what YOU see, and tell them. you are the eyes of the team. The horse will know how high to jump by the intensity and timing of your cues.  So as long as you keep int under 4 feet, don't try to run the Olympics, and remember that, as a horse just learning to jump, he is at a slight disability, and may hit more poles than most at first. He will most likely need a lot of precise cues from you, but once he know;s what do do, I'm sure he can ace the competition!  However, I suggest two things:  1: have a vet give you their opinion. All sight limitations are different, and your horses' may be more severe than we realize.  Other than that, Arabians are not incredibly gifted jumpers, in general, so just have your horse's conformation and such OKed.     2: I suggest you have your horse wear closed-front splint boots.  For most jumping, I suggest open front, because the horse really knows when he's hit a pole, and is more likely to avoid it. However, because your horse can't see what he's doing as well as other horses, and could hit every pole at first, you don't want him to get frustrated by the constant punishment for jumping. If he gets smacked in the knees every time he jumps, he may eventually, just refuse to jump at all.  Best of luck in all things horsey!|`|nIskOkn2aa	My favorite eventing horse is completely blind in one eye; it doesn't faze him.    When I started jumping him seriously, he was half blind in the one eye - he could see some forwards, but not back.  And he'd spook at shadows; things would JUMP out at him (or so he thought).    Give him time to adjust to his blindness, and he'll be fine.     The most I jump my horse is three feet, but that's because of me (I'm too old to bounce when I hit the ground!) not him.  He shows no fear and is a bold jumper in the field.    Good Luck with yours!  The eye will be a minor handicap; the real test is in his heart and mind.|`|04QDV97kaa	Dangerous, but possible. I read once about an almost blind horse that knew how to jump. But he had been trained before he went blind so that's kind of different.   I'm sure that you could train him to jump but it would take a lot of work and whole lot of patience.   You would need to start out with just getting him broke to ride.   I would suggest that at the same time you are doing that to take the times when you're not training to get him used to things like rattling tin cans, and plastic bags. Start out with a cloth bag and let him sniff the bag. Then rub it on his legs and back and slowly progress toward his head. Whenever he starts to show any signs of being at all nervous take the bag away and try again later. When he is completely used to the cloth bag you could progress to a paper bag and repeat the steps. After that you can go on to plastic bags and cracking plastic bottles. Each one of the items might take an hour, a day, or even a week for him to get used to them. Go slowly and don't rush him at all. Eventually, if you stick to it, you'll have a bombproof horse, even with his one blind eye.  During that time also start leading him over poles laid out on the ground. The poles should be placed about 3-4 ft apart for walking over them. When you progress to trotting in hand they should be 4-5 ft apart. Once you have him going over the poles easily raise them about 2 inches off the ground. Keep walking and trotting him over them gradually raising the bars.  By the time you have done all that you would probably be getting close to or already be riding him. Once you are riding him start riding him over the ground poles laid on the ground again at a walk and slowly progress back up untill you get the poles off the ground again.  (Also rub him with bags while on the horse and have a helper wave bags and drop things near him while the horse is in a controled area)  Once you have all that groundwork laid I would recommend getting some jumping lessons from a reputable trainer.  I wish you the best of luck!  Lucy|`|4884c661c8938910239d7729a16fc338aa	Yes they can. I knew a horse who did not have his right eye. He lost it in a trailer accident. He competed regularly in 3'3" hunter classes. The woman who rode him would click at him at the take off spot of the jump to reinforce him to jump. He was an awesome jumper. He won all his classes.|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	My horse is half blind. And she does mini jumps on the lunge line! SO I see no problem.=]|`|UhiRrojoaa	Depending on how long his vision has been that bad he may not ever get used to the shadows, on jumping, once he is broke, his depth perception will be off due to only one eye working. You should have him walk over some logs, or whatever you have, and if he stumbles over them he may not have the coordination needed to do anything over four feet. Start slow. Good luck with him though.|`|mSTwx1Kwaa	Totally. I've heard of a totally blind horse who did everything a normal horse could do even xcountry! desensitize him to all that you can. talk to him when he gets nervous let him know you are there and with you around nothing will ever hurt him. He will feel very vulnerable with only one eye so be careful to not come up on him or anything.
AA10091923	as of this date...i am pretty sure there is not a pregnancy test kit for a cat...so call your vet and ask for the signs....they may want to see her...but if you dont have the cash to go..just ask what you should be looking for.    if she is pregnant---after the babies are born - call the vet and ask how soon she can be fixed since she will be nursing...the MALE can be fixed now.    and if she is pregnant...what a wonderful miracle you will get to witness.    she will be fine either way...cal your vet with questions in the morning.    good luck  :)|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Take her in to be spayed immediately.  The outcome for such a young cat to have kittens isn't good.  She should be fueling her own growing body, not a pregnancy.|`|FDZNJXxcaa	she would need to see a vet... though while you wait to see if she is pregnant get your male fixed so if she isn't it doesn't happen again. she should do just fine if she pregnant   do some research on helping her along with pregnancy, birth, and mother hood|`|ZWg8VBXJaa	Well, she still seems a little bit young. But I guess it is probable. If you get her spayed now, they will (maybe) remove the kittens IF there is any. Yes, cats do go into heat in winter. They can go in heat at any time. Being in heat is when a cat's hormones say, I'm ready to have kittens. Some signs of pregnancy can include hot pink nipples, eating alot, and she will be looking for a place that is secluded where she can have her kittens.|`|a32c1304cb0d1f4dfc740a147b2bc39faa	She probably is "beginning" to be pregnant. Well IF this is her first batch, and you were to late to spay her, I would make a comfortable place for her to give birth because most first batches aren't so well because of inexperience. But you can be there to help her.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You can still get her spayed in the early stages of pregnancy. I suggest calling your vet to make an appointment ASAP. You don't need a litter of kittens!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO if she just was bred by your male, I'd take her in NOW and spay her.  They don't have to be "in heat" to breed and can breed anytime.  Your male needs to be next in line and soon!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	You can get her spayed now. The sooner the better actually. She's too young to be having a litter and it will be better for her to be spayed now.|`|zguucR8yaa	A veterinarian can tell by an xray, ultrasound or just palpating her abdomen. If early enough in her pregnancy, abortion is an option. She is too young for this pregnancy.  Please spay her.
56mYVHTyaa	The only thing that I can think of to get rid of the smell of urine is vinegar.  Use a cloth to blot up as much urine as possible.  Mix one part or more vinegar with three parts water and put it in a spray bottle and spray your boots with it.  You might have to use straight vinegar on your boots because cat urine is super strong smelling.  It should kill the odor.  Repeat if necessary. This works really good with carpet. I have a chihuahua and sometimes she has accidents and I use vinegar to get rid of the smell.  Vinegar is usually safe on fabrics.  I have never tried it on suede so maybe you could test a small area first.  Keep in mind that the vinegar smell will go away.|`|AA10091923	without ruining your boots?    well that will depend...did you treat them with the water repellant that you buy with them?  if you did then it will be easy...if not -well we will get to that.    so if you did treat them with the water repellant spray...then wipe them off with a damp cloth and then spray them completely with Natures Miracle -for cats only ....you can get this at any pet store (make sure it is for cats only)....this will take out stains and ordor.    BUT...if you did not treat your suede...this could be pricey.  you may need to get online with the manufacturer to see what they suggest.  Or contact your local cleaners who do suede cleaning...in the mean time I have given you a couple of websites which address this issue.    http://www.allnaturalproducts.com/faq    http://snowcleaners.com/services/leather...    good luck  :)|`|B8Gwxo1laa	http://www.cat-lovers-only.com/how-to-re...|`|Nx52cSsDaa	thats funny :D ahhahaha, good luck try ice and never side rub.  BLOT !|`|CR7xpXPuaa	i would try to wash them with this stuff. it's all natural so wont hurt you and it is supposed to work on all surfaces, prob worth checking out.    http://www.w4petproducts.com/cat-urine-r...
d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	that tank is way too small to house a discus.   not even one.    wait on these cichlids until you can get a 70 or bigger, just for them. It will need to be pretty heavily planted as well.|`|ZVYY7nOlaa	Discus needs at least a 50 gallon tank. They are very delicate and expensive fish. I would not recommend it, but you can try.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	Discus are diva fish, they prefr to be in small groups of thre own kind.    A discus will not like your setup....It's best to get 4-5 but at least 2.    i would wait till you have the right size tank first.      good luck!!!
lMOXHh45aa	start yellin and slappin your bed, then get up and grab the gat and a couple of grenades and bomb the *SH!T* out of it... shoot anything that moves|`|4TqadRJYaa	Set some mouse traps.|`|DfQCtjXraa	Call people that come over to kill that little bastards..^^|`|NLAek2bJaa	Seriously get some traps.. Mice love bread and peanut butter.. You will definitely get a bite on one of those things. It worked every single time for me when I was living in a basement when they would constantly eat all my hamster food!!|`|uKpBVAyvaa	Ask somebody to  scare it out of room then set traps in there|`|2Mvrxdn7aa	buy some rid and let it do the work for you..i had that problem years ago when I lived in milwaukee. my dang ol nasty neighbors had got them somehow so we had to use that to get rid of it. they disentigrate on theor own so you don't smell anything or see anything. hell, you really don't have to do much but place it where you want it.|`|86b28287757c82684fcf1bf59441d9aeaa	I would say continue sleeping in your moms room until the mice get trapped.  The same thing that you said. lol|`|6cEwF2Vraa	Do you have another bed or couch?!?!|`|C5UUltHtaa	Seriously, mice are more afraid of you. They will run and hide if you take a broom or something to clear out what anything that was under your bed. Get some traps and get them out before they invite all their relatives for the party.  Good Luck    P.S.   A cat would make a good pet for you.|`|QXffenE8aa	leave the room
58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	First baby incisor teeth, (the two in the middle) appear between birth and the first week of age. (The permanent set arrive between 2 and a half- 3 years).  Second baby incisor teeth (either side of the first two) arrive between 6-9 months (permanent set between 3 and a half- 4 years).  Third baby inscisor teeth (either side of the above set) arrive between 6-9 months (permanent set 4 and a half- 5 years).    Both a year old and a grown horse will have a full set of incisors, so it is important to look at the incisors and determine if they are dedicious teeth or permanent teeth. The baby teeth (decidious) look different from the permanent teeth. The surface of the milk teeth is white and there are usually several grooves on the surface. The permanent teeth are larger, more rectangular and are usually more yellow in colour. The gum margin of the baby teeth incisors is also rounded compared to the margin of the permanent teeth which is more square. If the horse is in the age where they are shedding their incisors, it is easy to tell the difference between the two sets of teeth. Don't try to determine the age of the horse by the incisor wear on the basis of baby teeth.    I'm guessing he's at least 9 months old, but could be slightly older.    Edit: From your further information regarding his teeth, he's more likely to be somewhere around 7 months old.|`|0kh2HEFMaa	Heres a few websites:    http://www.petpeoplesplace.com/resources...    http://www.essortment.com/hobbies/horses...    http://www.ehow.com/how_2067858_tell-hor...    http://www.wiwfarm.com/horseage.htm|`|NiQAfFUPaa	Probably about 10 months|`|034f5753f9ad6567e841eda4b3bd8210aa	The general rule for teeth is 6 days for the first pair, 6 weeks for the second pair, 6 months for the third pair.  So if your weanling has all six front teeth top and bottom he is  at least six months of age.  Generally 6 months is the time their wolf teeth start coming in as well.|`|mWsadBZRaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_teeth...  http://www.hanne.com/teeth-anatomy.html|`|px27V5N9aa	Here...    http://horses-arizona.com/pages/articles...      You know he was born in the summer of last year so just pick August.  So he is 6 months old now or you can call him a year.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	If you are having a vet come out any time soon, then they could tell :)  Google it, and you'll find some good sites with pictures of different ages.  :)  EDIT  Ah.  Well, judging by the tooth situation, its probably 9-11 months old, I could be wrong, however.|`|04QDV97kaa	Everything I have read says that when a horse has 6 teeth they are around 2 years old.  But if you are counting the milk teeth it would make him much younger.  Here is a quote from a different website.     "6 months - 2 years: At a young age, the horse will only have 4 incisors. They will have their milk teeth, but these are small and shouldn't be counted. By the time the horse reaches two years of age, two more incisors should have grown in to bring the total to 6.   2 years - 4 1/2 years: At two years, there should be 6 incisors in addition to the milk teeth. The teeth will continue to grow and spread until the horse is around 4 1/2 years old, at which time they will begin to replace the milk teeth. The milk teeth will disappear as the teeth continue to grow. "    I hope this helps.  Lucy|`|uVgqDlrcaa	it's kinda easy to tell an age..     well for an experienced person.. lol just by the size of him..    but yes, a vet or horse dentist can give you a good guess at the age.
6puzMUP1aa	never feed your bearded dragon meal worms they cannot digest the shells that the meal worms have. they love live prey they like to chase and hunt. here is a list of things to feed your bearded dragon.|`|JkrVo263aa	well , it is best if u feed the bearded dragons live food. You would probably have to ask the pet store if u can actually feed them frozen food. But live food is best and is preferred by your bearded dragon.   I hope this helped!|`|NIPmV4uMaa	At your local petstore, you can buy freeze-dried insects such as crickets, locusts, fruit flies, worms, etc. Some beardies will eat them, some won't. However, recent studies have suggested that in the process of freeze-drying, insects lose some nutritional value. If you are going to use freeze-dried insects, feed your beardie some live food too.|`|ZLFgVHreaa	Mealworms and waxworms are the only type of worms that you can put in the fridge until you take them out to come back to life. There are canned crickets that you can get at pet stores, but I would rather feed them live crickets. Besides insects, they can eat fruit, veggies, and specific pellets. So there's a variety you can feed them instead of just insects.|`|1gJ92tJaaa	you can keep meal worms in the fridge for a while then they come back to life.|`|9QHwLQEraa	Bearded Dragons prefer Live crickets. Also, mealworms are Fatty and are better as treats for your Dragon. I keep my live crickets in a bin in the garage, I built a lid, and i put a heat lamp over them so they don't die in the cold. Pinkies aren't really good for Dragons either, unless yours is a few years older and big enough to eat them. I hope this helps! Have fun with your Beardie!|`|YK8zJNluaa	Feed live insects to your beardies, they will love you for it.  Dead ones are no good. Your beardies love to chase and hunt, and you will see more active dragons come feed time, thats for sure.  All my lizards are feed on live insects. And they love it.
IGfnrfGPaa	He will look similar, very cute dog.   http://www.flickr.com/photos/31495565@N0...  Just check out the pics of my dogs, the oldest are when they were 12 weeks old, they are now 2.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Well much larger but doubt he has changed too much.  Short haired & the colors don't change dramatically.|`|ACaCgLkKaa	I am sure he looks different, my dogs seem to look nothing like the pictures we took when they were puppies.....|`|B462BQYzaa	looks like he got some lab in him    very cute - got some huge ears ^_^|`|S7Demh3Raa	since you don't know what breed it is it is hard to say. it will probabley change prportional and its fur may be lighter/darker but he should look reletively the same.    hope your up for him hes going to be a big dog!|`|jye4eXw5aa	he's adorable.|`|m5aqFpeEaa	looks like a cross between a labrador and a golden retriever! i don't think it will change much but it might change just a bit! it's a really cute dog!|`|q2gNXyUYaa	He looks like he has some lab in him.

I8Zq39igaa	Oh By Jove yes, it's most upsetting!|`|P8Q39vA4aa	I hate hunting wolves from helicopters yes. i think if the animal is becoming dangerous and they only option is hunting then its ok. My uncle is a hunter he hunts in season. If they hunt out of season then its not ok. I dont believe in hunting for fur. If we were suppose to have fur then evolution would have kept fur on us.     would i hunt no, is it wrong to hunt no.|`|9UttDvcsaa	All hunting bothers me, but I still eat deer and axis.  My husband is a really big hunter, he is going to kill deer anyway so i might as well eat everything he kills.  I would have a BIG BIG problem if he killed anything we didn't eat.  I don't know why anyone would kill a coyote or wolf that is sad bc it would be needless.  Foxes get killed for their fur and that is it, really sad!|`|B462BQYzaa	hunting in general bothers me, it doesnt have to be from the canine family.|`|iMz85oCjaa	Hunting of any kind bothers me it doesn't matter what kind of animal.|`|8jJPqecSaa	Well, hunting in general, I don't really like. All animals, like humans, are equal. That's what I like to think. Think of those poor animal's lives! :(|`|rd5t1Lm3aa	same here. hunting really  i just hate. they think oh a few cant hurt then they are blind to see that it cause problems! overpopulation is the major one. and then there's putting the species on the Endangered list. so yeah it extremely bothers me....|`|9pVWBpC8aa	My boyfriends parents are into hunting very much, in general hunting makes me sad, but I don't disagree if someone hunts and then uses the animal for food....I DO NOT AGREE WITH COATS. When my boyfrends parents hunt they only hunt certain animals..they wont shoot younger animals and they wont hunt for "shits and giggles". They have alot of coyotes and foxes on their property but they don't hunt them because there is no use for killing an animal and then throwing away the carcass or using it's fur as a coat. So in general, all hunting makes me sad, but I see no use for hunting an animal that you can't eat. I love my dog I couldn't imagine someone shooting her just for fun.|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	hunting for sport bothers me because you dont eat the meat, you just steal their hides, but the population of these animals need to be controlled.
3BMBZtDxaa	I have a few favorites. I'll explain each one ;]    First off, Arabians. I don't know. I just have always been drawn to them. It's like each one I meet I have a connection with and I always get a big smile. I love their spirit and willingness to please, plus their endurance and drive. Not to mention their elegance! I love it how they can be hardy or stick thin, and all the color combinations they can come in. I like it how they can be used in nearly every discipline, and that they are so beautiful yet kick butt in endurance riding! Their character is funny and wild, and yet there are some who are absolutely lazy! It's just fun to see all their personalities.    Next up, Quarter Horses. I like their calmness and their ability to be so sweet to humans. I love the way they look and their silly antics, but the way they level their head and just mosy on over! Not to mention the look in their eyes. There's something there. Like as if they'd been on this earth for years and years and know so much more than you do but they won't rub it in your face.     I also really love National Show Horses. I've had really good luck with them! The one horse I've fully connected with was a NSH. I loved him to death!! And his full sister is the cutest thing :] She's so sweet! It's like they have the tallness and structure of a Saddlebred but then the silliness of an Arabian. The best of both worlds!    Half-Arabians are pretty awesome, too. I can't explain why I like them. It's just everything about them! Basically what I said about the full Arabian, minus the elegance in their looks. They always look more structured and gentle. Don't know why, but they do!    Oh, and then there was a Welsh X Draft cross that was the BEST. He was my perfect height and was so responsive, he was a dream! But he also was extremely calm and laid-back to the point where you could just do anything you wanted and he wouldn't have a care in the world. Yet, his get-up-and-go hadn't left him! Plus, he had this beautiful palomino/chestnut type coloring. I wish I could have owned him because he was everything you wanted in a horse!    Well, there's my two cents :]|`|XJWeuLPoaa	mustang   or Arabians   my grandpa owns a ranch for retired Olympian horses and the ones that come in are mustangs and Arabians, there characters are so funny and hearty its amazing lol|`|VEhj9pleaa	Arabians|`|jQvT6k7raa	Well, I love horses in general, and I don't; think breed or bloodlines matter very much, but I would say my favorite breed is Appendix Quarter Horses!  They have the speed and "stock" of the quarter horse with the  energy and English flare of a thoroughbred!  *sighs*  Anyway, I just think they are great all-rounders, especially in speed events, because they have the speed of quarter horses (yes, QH's are faster that TB's over shorter distances...a quarter mile, to be exact.) with the speed AND endurance of the Thoroughbred. Bred right, they are dreamy barrel horses, and  great trail animals, too.|`|QGecNxmgaa	I love mustang's and arabs...both high-strung, smart horses that can be hard headed just like me!|`|04QDV97kaa	My favorites are the Arabian and the QH.  I love how beautiful the Arabians are and how gracefully they move.  The QHs because of all the old westerns and how they are able to do so many things.  Lucy|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Arabians!!      Because I endurance ride, and they're the best for the job!    And I love their personality!! Always ready to go!!|`|OJIXRFxMaa	My favorites are just warmbloods in general, I do h/j currently so I'm around warmbloods all the time and they are just amazing to me, their personalities, their build, their wit, it's great.|`|1l8KBXsbaa	Belgian, they are bigger and stronger than anything else.|`|gbaw9wHWaa	I have a Appendix mare, the breed is a good all arounder...but.. I tend to love iberian breeds like the andalusian and lipizzan because of their willingness and temperment...|`|cav0EBSWaa	my fav horse breed is an arabian because of their loyalty to humans|`|1iGp2etEaa	The Paso Fino because of their unusual color.|`|h38M7Eofaa	arabians!  they're hot, fun to ride, beautiful, have 1 more vertebrae than other breeds.. making them different!    :)|`|9GwAXLntaa	Arabians because they have their own spirit and they definitely have a brain.|`|BIR9olyxaa	Warmbloods. There's nothing better than watching a well-bred, in-shape warmblood clear a jump in perfect form... unless you're the one jumping said horse, of course.|`|iM7xmRxkaa	Friesians! They are amazing and beautiful and show like a dream! I've been soooo fortunate to be around them and I had the opportunity to work with them one summer. They're gorgeous animals.|`|AA11341121	Appaloosa...was my first horse , had him from 8 months till he was 15 when he passed away . We not sure why, either a snake bite or a heart attack. Was quite a few years ago now but he was so lovely I still miss him. As you say, the Appy's are very smart, versatile , and have great personalities! I too love all horses!|`|oGVWdnHraa	I love Walers, my friend has one, he has the most awesome personality and always has to be up in everyones business, like a few weeks ago when I was putting a sticker on my car, he had to help me "clean" the glass by licking it lol :)|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	I like:  Quarabs- I have had so much luck with these.  My first horse was this, and she is so sweet.  QH disposition, Arab looks :)  Pretty and nice!  ^S  Appy/QH- agree with you there.  My gelding is that cross, and he's just great!  ^M  Paints- Love their colors, love their personalities.  I've had a couple paints, and they are SO sweet.  ^M  Falabellas- so cute.  so small.  so nice.  I just love them!  ^HL  And random mixes that nobody knows what is included in there :)  Haha they rock.|`|HCuArmpGaa	my favorite breed is the Gypsy Vanner. they are very hardy and have an amazing temperament. I have not had the chance to own one due to them being quite rare and expensive. But i have alwatss admited their beauty!|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Basically any type of Warmblood (excluding Oldenburgs).  Trakheners, Dutch, Swedish, Hanoverian... They're all good.    I like them for their sensiblity, power, and jumping form.  They are athletic but not too hot.|`|3O2SfwIBaa	the best breed are the TB. you can't go past them they do it all.
b6sTngHpaa	you could try to explain to your parents that you are getting older, and would like your room to be a place where your things are respected, just as you respect your parents room. If your sister has her own room, then I believe she already has a place where she can play. You didn't mention how old your sister is, but if you are close in age, it may be more difficult for both of you. You need your own space, she wants to do what you do.   I am a mom, my daughter is 8, my autistic son is 7, and my daughter is very good with her brother, but I realize that she needs her own time, her own things, her own space. This is true of all kids when they reach a certain age. It is not her job to watch my son, or clean up after him, it's mine, as a parent I have to make sure not to put too much responsibility on her when it comes to her brother. They fight, like any kids, and he tries to go into her room, and she hates it when he messes with her things, so, your not alone.     Ask your parents to set aside a little time where you can have a meeting, explain to them that you would like the chance to prove that you are responsible enough to have a guinea pig. Ask if they would let you keep it in your room, and ask them to help you gain some independence by keeping your room locked. Don't be too disappointed if they say no, I'm sure there are reasons for the choices they make, and don't throw a fit if they say no, prove you are mature by simply saying "ok, thank you for listening. "    Also, try to understand where your sister is comming from, you can have a good relationship with her, if you try. Autistic people can be difficult to understand, so learn her language, what do you have in common? what can you teach her?     I hope this helps,
CdRlOsnyaa	Check the heat of your turtle tank should be around 78-80 degrees, if the tank is at the right temperture go to the pet store adn get turtle eye drops they cost around 7.99 ( thats how much i bought mine for) read the directions on the eye drops and follow them. if that doesnt work tank the turtle out the tank roughly 3 times a day and put him in a tub with water at like 85 degrees soak him in there and brush his closed eye wit ha cotton swab. watch out for him basking to much you dont want to hurt his scrutes. if none of this works take him to the vet.|`|u61yKsE3aa	It's prolly not blind the eyes are most likely swollen and closed because of another health issue.  How warm is she.  Her water should be upper seventies lower eighties.  She should also have a basking spot around 90-95 she needs a UV light.  Not having these things and being cold are the most likely cause.  If you have this all set up correctly then you will need to take her to a vet to find out what underlining cause is maker her lethargic and her eyes swollen. For food you will want to try a variety.  Fish, insects, shrimp, krill, etc. If it's older they become more vegetarians and you can try different veggies like squash carrots kale etc.  You should ask the pet store or who ever you got her from what she was eating for them.|`|ld2vmypNaa	LEAFY greens and  fruits which give the turtles vitamin A and other vitaminss. . Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...  .  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies) at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.    **** If these are hatchlings a 1 1/2  they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish cant out run the baby turtle.  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms.  As they get older they can have  snails, crickets, flies, crayfish, small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them) any other leafy greens will do for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, remember cut up in small pieces..|`|vS1Z0inOaa	First, you need to address her eye problem. Swollen eyes can be infection, or it can be a symptom of Vitamin A deficiency which could very well be possible if you've only had her one week and she hasn't eaten.     To treat infection, raise the water temperature 5 degrees and the basking temperature to 95 to 100 degrees. Get some ZooMed Turtle Eye Drops and start using that on both eyes to clear them out. Keep it warm for one week after her eyes clear up and keep up with the drops for one week after that.     To get some nutrition into her, mix up a little PediaLyte with just a few drops of Ensure and put that into a bowl with just enough water for her to sit in. Leave her in that for at least an hour everyday. Hopefully she will drink some while she's in there and that should keep her stable for now. Turtles require very little to keep them alive for awhile, so this should work until you get her eyes addressed.     To address any possible vitamin A deficiency, just the first 3 days, put a drop or two of cod liver oil into this mix. This will give her sufficient vitamin A for awhile. Since too much vitamin A is as bad as too little and the Ensure has some, don't use the cod liver oil after 3 days at the most.     When you notice her eyes are getting better and she's getting stronger, if she's still disoriented and not eating you'll likely have to teach her how to eat without sight. That will take quite a bit of time and alot of patience, but a blind turtle can live a very fulfilling life once you've done this. Mine don't even act blind--they swim all over the tank without bumping into tank decor unless I moved something ;) If she gets better but doesn't get her sight back, feelfree to contact me and ask about how to teach your turtle how to live without sight.
7Zqn3DdEaa	Here, I googled your question and i found this site. it has many reasons why your hermit crab might be out of its shell!  http://exoticpets.about.com/od/hermitcra...    i know alot about many pets, but crabs aren't my speciality. That site seemed to have alot of helpful tips and reasons.   I read a bunch of different sites that talk about why the crab could be out of his shell, and the main reason mentioned seems to be stress, or climate/temperature.  I really hope this helps!  I'm sorry i couldn't give you any tips myself.|`|L9pIz342aa	Hermit Crabs can come out for many reasons, usually it is because they are looking for a new shell or something. When Crabs molt they molt WITH their shell on so that would not be why.  this site has instructions on how to put a crab back in its shell. Be very careful and get some more shells asap so it can switch to a new one.  http://www.ehow.com/how_2052517_put-nake...|`|e3dn380haa	I hate to tell you this, but my hermit crab was acting the same way two weeks ago... and it died. Give it more food and water and cross your fingers! good luck!
vqQsvy4kaa	Everybody gave great answers, but I concur on the one to remove her from the room. DONT put her outside, that is just too dangerous for her. We LoVe love LOVE our cat, but sleep is important too. So, we remedied the problem by putting her on the glass enclosed back porch. We took an old futon mattress and folded it, then put stuffed toys, fleece blankets and a pillow on it and made her a little kitty kat nest. She loves it and does not meow all night because she can't get in my room (the back porch is right out my bedroom) even though she knows I'm on the other side of the door.|`|AA10091923	Monica:  simple---she wants to sleep / cuddle with you.  she luvs you!  leave the door open...problem solved! (except at breakfast time-she will wake you)     good luck  :)|`|9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	My husband and I usually leave the bedroom door open unless we have company. That seems to satisfy our two.    But if that's not an option, you may need to crate your kitty and ignore her- and that will be hard. Cats, when they want something, can be persistent.    Good luck!|`|n7bok7NRaa	Learn to ignore her. It'll take time - but if you keep rewarding her by yelling or opening the door, she'll just keep it up because she wants your attention.    If you keep the door closed, and you stay very quiet, she might howl and scratch at the door, but eventually, if you don't come out to play, she'll realize she'll have to find something else to do with her time. It'll take a while - at least a week (if not more).|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Lock her up at night.    Or leave her outside at night.. But then she'll just go meow at your window.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Leave your bedroom door open.........then you won't have to get up!      She probably just wants some attention, and can get on the bed and "cuddle", instead of crying at the door.  If she does this, just put your arm around her and hug her to you.  Soon, you'll both go back to sleep.  Sure beats waking yourself up COMPLETELy to open the door!!    Hope this helps..........Good luck.|`|YVOlCNmaaa	my cat does that all the time. They just want attention.|`|7Zqn3DdEaa	Maybe she wants to play with you?  Or is her litter box cleaned? Cats can be very picky, and she might need to use her litter box, but thinks its too dirty for her.|`|DT7yF1roaa	Maybe your cat needs to go outside to use the restroom. If you yell at your cat alot when she does something wrong, maybe she's afraid of that.|`|iRhXfrNXaa	I think that your cat isn't tired when you are. I have three cats and they sleep most of the day and really become awake later at night. Also, one comes and sleeps on my bed for a few hours, and then roams about my house. I would just leave the door open because I know how annoying it is when they whine outside the door all night. You could try to have them sleep less during the day, like with some sort of toy?    Hope this helps.|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	Try playing with her a lot about 30 minutes before going to bed.  Get one of those laser light things or any kind of toy that she can run around with.  Get her good and worn out from playing and see if that works.  Or try keeping a radio playing softly in another part of the house.  Or keep the TV on in the living room all night and see if that doesn't keep her company.  She's bored for sure.|`|ccbtdEjJaa	She just wants the door open...then when you open it, she thinks its time to play "chase the me [cat]"...If you can bear it leave the door cracked to let her enter....If not, the next time she does it clap loudly or better yet shake a can or jar of coins once near the door...it worked for my little cat, but he finally realized that Mommy likes to sleep at nite and started just jumping on the bed and curling up at the foot of the bed to be close. :-)      Now he just does it when I go into the bathroom...|`|TBZK5q78aa	It's out of curiosity. Remember curiosity kills the cat. Anything elusive to them will be questioned. If they cannot explore it they will attempt to find out what is going on. My cat meows at every close door in the house so he can get in. They usually just look in the room for a moment and leave. My best advice is to leave your door open so the cat will be able to come in at his discretion.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> Play with her 15 min's in the morning , may her/him tired , he/she will be tired    > Leave your bedroom door open.|`|C93lTJozaa	Place the cat in a area where it cant get near your bedroom door .Give her a toy and make sure she has a litter box and water..Have a good night sleep ,,Z Z Z Z Z all night Not MEOWS
3n60UxgQaa	I find that intensity of the gravid spot usually isn't reliable.  I tend to look at the size of the stomach and the shape.    When females are ready to give birth within the week, their stomach usually turns boxy rather than the roundish.    It's really hard to catch it on camera but if you look closely, you may be able to see the squarish stomach.  http://www.aquariumfish.net/images_01/my...  http://www.liveaquaria.com/images/articl...    How to care for the fry?  Water quality is VERY important.  Perform water changes weekly.  Feed them crushed flakes (fine powder) 3-6 times a day, as much as they can eat in 30 seconds or so, usually a pinch.    Again, intensity of gravid spot usually isn't a good indication of when they will give birth.|`|0GLWWnmcaa	they do eat tiny fish and blood worms worms|`|TjLCnxkKaa	the fry will eat finely crushed flake     feed often but not too much per feeding.    Edit- with additional.    Dude.... you asked- "just tell me what to feed, and care 4 guppy fry"    If you didn't want that answered perhaps you shouldn't have asked.|`|gJGlLZ83aa	buy some fish fry food. its like 3.99.. unless u cheap than i dunno!?
TdrgZwnoaa	No way! My dog spends the better part of the day outside romping through his own pee and poop. Furthermore, he doesn't wipe after he poops either. There is no way in Hades that he is getting up on my bed. It`s kind of a moot point anyway as he will not go up the stairs to our sleeping area unless coaxed. He appears quite happy to sleep on the landing and keep the cats from coming upstairs as well. This arrangement seems to work well for all concerned parties.|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Both my Boston Terrier pups do, but they usually leave in the middle of the night.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	My Basenji Schnauzer mix sleeps in bed with me. My Husky mix sleeps in her crate or on the couch.|`|a6an2aN0aa	Yes but only after I invite them up. If they hop up without permission their bed privileges are suspended for the night!  8)|`|aL2LPYfaaa	Yes|`|sgxGglK4aa	Yeah, we have a Jack Russell.  They are snuggle bugs, they have to touch someone when they sleep.  He really doesn't take up much room, but he thinks the foot of the bed is his territory.  Now that he's getting a little older, he has started to snore as well.  On another note however, when I feel bad or ache, or have just had a bad day, he seems to know and he cuddles up and by just being there he helps me feel better.|`|m5aqFpeEaa	yes he does and he is very cute when he does!|`|VgDG7k36aa	I have a friend that has a small dog (like a chihuahua) and lets it seep on his bed. It depends, if you have a small dog, you might let it sleep in your bed. But if it's like a great dane, I wouldn't.|`|v6Wx2Pp1aa	yes and i love it!! i know its bad but they are so cute when they cuddle up to your feet and you feel that little warm bump next to you ^.^|`|HxfE4oYwaa	No, i would never let my dog sleep in my bed, she has a dog house but this is because she sheds a lot and she never really sleeps, she 'rests her eyes', a born watch dog.  If you had a small non shedding dog maybe it could sleep in the house.|`|dSaPi2kVaa	No. she use to though but I stopped letting her she got too big.|`|DCFTQvYPaa	no, not with me but with my parents but, my dog is a doxie/rat terrier so she is tiny and takes up no real space.|`|236ec04bbd4131ca8c28403df2b8717caa	Yes!    I have a miniature dachshund and she sleeps with us every night.  She's adorable, and loves to cuddle in between me and my husband.  Between her and our electric blanket, we're nice and warm all night!|`|Yyv4WQLiaa	yes since the day i got him as a puppy, loves to burrow, so spoiled|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Yes, upside down, right next to me, with all 4 in the air.|`|s4Rii6PDaa	YES! and its so cute because if i lie on my tummy he curls up on my back and sleeps there!|`|DWx7Yfblaa	I used to own a rottweiler, a lab and a terrier mix.

siE3TpgFaa	There are many breeds and a number have been posted here. However, you should realize that each breed has been bred for specific reasons. So one breed might be better for your lifestyle than another, whether or not you prefer the looks of one breed or not. FAR better to choose a breed which fits how you live.    Some breeds are mellower than others. Some are hyper. These things are really important to research. And mixed breed dogs at the shelter can be wonderful. That's the best way to adopt, and a good shelter will advise you and help you make a good choice.  No matter the size, all dogs need exercise, regular pee and poo time, gentle training, a quiet, safe place to sleep, and a sane owner.  They are NOT bling, or here to make your image better. They are here to be the most amazing friend you will ever have.|`|oGVWdnHraa	http://www.akc.org/breeds/toy_group.cfm    Toy breed dogs as recognised by the AKC, not all stay less than 10 lbs, but you can have a look throught the standards for those who do :)|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Cute is NOT  a VALID REASON TO GET A DOG  ALL PUPPIES ARE CUTER, BUT LOOSE THERE CUTENESS FACTOR WHEN THEY GROW UP.

NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    There's a solution to this - but it's gross - so bear with me!    When there's fresh pee in the wheel, take a bit of her bedding and soak it in the pee, place it in a different spot in her cage, preferably a corner.     Immediately remove and clean the wheel with a 50/50 vinegar and warm water mix.  This will neutralize the scent on the wheel.  Rinse it clean and replace it.    It may take *many* tries doing this, but it WILL eventually work.    What your hamster is doing is actually quite natural.  In the wild, when they run, they don't stop and look for a bush to go hide behind, but you can re-train them.    If you see her go to her pee corner (once it's established) and use it, reward her with a treat.  Hamsters are creatures of habit - and rewards will help her learn that she's doing something right :)    Oh yeah - don't try the hamster potties if people suggest them - they're a waste of time and money - your hammie is more likely to roll in the litter to clean itself than actually use it as a potty ;)    Best of luck!    Daisy|`|yAlyAt8Zaa	I would take it to the vet. This could be a sign of wet tail. That is a disease that COULD make the hamster DIE. Tack it to the vet right away.|`|mXEOcSeuaa	I'm sorry to say, but there isn't much you can do beside cleaning it out every day.  Most hamsters can't be trained to do something or not to do something.  I had the same problem with one of my hamsters a while back.|`|XdPstcwsaa	possibly buy a different wheel like one with holes in it?|`|sw2R5A9iaa	this is normal.  you can consider giving the animal to someone who is more patient and understanding.
moVaAmB6aa	Hi I am vet assistant and also pet specialist for petco.     you need a cage,one with close together bars so the mouse can't climb out. recycled newspaper bedding is great to use and very assorbent! and can be found at most pet stores. a small bowl for food. a water bottle. a water bowl they could drown in. they like vegetables. carrots, deep green romaine lettuce,. They tend to get smelly depending home many u have at once. but if u have only one id say 1 time a week unless you happen to pick one that poops waaaay to much! lol also have a wheel in the cage! they love to run! to make them take a bath buy a little bowl and place dry powder or dust bath products found in all pet stores, they clean themselves in it. they are  easy to care for!  HOPE THIS HELPS!!|`|q0Dg8a1haa	They aren't difficult to care for. You just clean out the cage and feed them. A small bird cage with the wire floor taken out is normally enough space, as they like to climb. If you get females, get two, but males tend to be territorial so it might be best to keep him alone.|`|TTs6GBBUaa	You need a cage at least the size of a 10 gallon tank, some hutches/ huts for them to hide in, a food bowl big enough to feed the amount you have, toys and chew sticks, and a wheel for excersise. Also for cheap intertainment for your mouse/mice put in a couple tp rolls.
1e8e91e5d82095a358c451f8017d24e8aa	well lets see here lol    My cat sleeps on face   My cat also feels the need to lay on what ever i am doing at the time like reading or doing homework. He will just jump on and sit on it so that i pay attention to him and then when i do he hops down and walks away    My cow purposly kicks me to let me know that im not paying attention to her, she will also bring me piles of hay that are for her to eat and drop some in my lap so that i can hand feed her or so i can eat it ( which i never do)    My rabbit Chi likes to mark my face (rubs his chin on my nose)  My rabbit Chloe loves her Dewlap scratched( its kind of like a double chin lol but it's normal on all female rabbits)  My rabbit mya runs in terror from me and then when im not looking she comes to the cage door and stares at me until i pick her up and hold her    finally my dog, he takes my underwear and feels the need to take it outside and leave it in the snow....... i don't give it to him , he goes into the laundry room and takes it from my basket    Ya gotta love the pets that make you happy :)|`|gG2CuoF8aa	My cat drinks her water weird. She sticks her paw in the dish, and licks her paw instead if drinking out of the bowl. :)|`|wM8qRy5laa	My cat Squeaker likes to walk all over you are doing and then lays down on it.     My dog Milliay does not like to walk on a leash and when she is on a leashshe is all over the place. My other dog P.D. is an angel!    My horse Roanie likes to rub his head all on me when I am done riding him. My other horse Dizzy always picks up and folds one of his front legs and then moves it. My other horse C.H. hates it when things go behind her butt area.    My cow Mama she will chase you around the pen until you stop and pet her and give her the attention she wants.    My weird animals! :)
tRfgwT5saa	She should be okay, cat food's just not that compatible with a dog's system.|`|YFzCJ1uaaa	i dont think there is rlly anything to worry about  its just that cat food is made for cats  so this would happen sorta similar if ur cat ate the pups food|`|5W18CzEsaa	But, why you feeding cat food to your puppy?

cGRyDCpQaa	Over the years at different barns there's been one kid from Iran, two people from Ireland, one from Germany, one from Finland, one kid from Mexico, and two from the UK.    Iran kid showjumping only... they have a HUGE showjumping barn over there.  Irish kid (my boyfriend lol) rides just about everything.  His mom (German) rides everything.  Finnish lady rides western pleasure.  Irish lady rides western pleasure but her husband (UK) doesn't really ride.  Mexican kid did hunters.  Other boarder from UK did just about everything.|`|f3bb70dee35ef28e84fcc054691669dbaa	We are just trail riding were I'm boarding my horse but there is English,  Russian and Spanish.    Were I first learned to ride, I was at a barn in Southern California.  For a short time there was Spanish (Mexico and US), Canada (French and English), and German.    I may not know how to speak in different languages but I can recognize horse and related words in various languages.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	I once rode at a dressage barn and a german woman was a master trainer- when she got angry she yelled at you in german hahah!|`|ejj2N3uaaa	No English? I bet that made for some interesting lessons! I'm a student teacher and I once had a child who spoke no English (she spoke Spanish, but I don't...) in a classroom. I can imagine how it would work with a horse as well!    I don't normally ride with a barn (occasionally I'll trailer my horse up to my sister's h/j barn to ride or I'll take him to the WP trainer for schooling) but I've ridden at plenty of barns over the years and rarely see any "other" nationalities, unless you count the grooms--at my sister's barn (pretty big, fancy h/j barn), all but one of the grooms are Spanish-speaking Mexicans (and yes, they are from Mexico...I'm not generalizing/stereotyping). One of them speaks a fair amount of English but the others don't, so trying to communicate with them about what to do with my horse (I brought him there last weekend to ride and be body clipped and he stayed for a night) was an experience :P. Lots of sign language! ha.     I also don't live in an area that has a lot of different nationalities, either, so maybe that's why I haven't really seen any at the barns.|`|rsp33Aysaa	My boarder is from England :]  Her and her husband are hilarious.  It's just funny to come to the barn and always hear her yelling stuff like "bloody h*ll!!"|`|KdLhlP3Yaa	Well in our barn there is English and Western.   We have got a lot of American Quarter's and some Thoroughbreds, Appendix, Morgans, Morabs, Paints, Tennessee Walkers a beautiful black Percheron Quarter, Hand full of Minis that are used for driving plus a Shire that's to much for the rider that owns him, and a few Arabians to make life interesting. Not to mention the Chickens that are multiplying every year, A white fluffy dog, two attention getting cats and the occasional rat that is fleeing for it's life because of said cats.  So I would say a bit of everything.|`|NfMasWZzaa	We are all white americans except for one lady that is Scottish.  But this is because we live in Maine- not the most diverse state, and it is a rather expensive barn.|`|AA11570905	Puerto Rican and American Caucasion mutt (me).  My husband is Puerto Rican and we keep our horses at home.|`|DLxh9CANaa	Most of us are Caucasian, but we do have one African American who boards her horse with us. Otherwise, it's just a mix of different European blends. Everyone at our barn speaks English just fine. We have one Italian American family who boards with us too.|`|px27V5N9aa	Well..the radio is Chinese.  The Wheelbarrow is...Chinese.  Charger says USA but I highly doubt that!  Trough is USA  My muck rake says USA!  That's about right.  The Lawnmower says USA but we all know it was made in Mexico.  Well lookie here, this says its from Canada!  This little doohickey says India!  My saddles are American    Man, i got the whole world here, all but Africa    edit: Oh..and I do not call myself Caucasian.  I am European American thank you.  I think the word Caucasian or white is offensive.  :)|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	In our city, there's basically no other nationalities.  There are a few african americans, not many.  They just ride western pleasure :)|`|rTSwouqXaa	What different does it make? I mean really who cares.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Um, one lady at our barn moved here from Germany. She can't ride, really, but she does, well.....I'm not sure. It's like eventing but she's not good enough/her horse trained enough to go compete, even at BN, yet.
I38WF5aFaa	Your brother is a sucker.  The saleswoman at the pet store recognized that and sold him an overpriced mutt.  Send him my way.  I can get him  a good deal on a bridge.|`|PM23RDycaa	FALSE. What your brother got was the typical BS petshop owner sales pitch.    first off Pomimo isn't a breed name it is a combo of REAL breeds. If you brother wanted a small white dog that looks somewhere between an Eskie and Pom he should have got a Volpino. THAT'S a real breed.    All your brother got was hot off the line a new mutt from the puppymill. If they are flying off the shelves its because this woman knows how to spot a gullible and uninformed buyer.|`|oGVWdnHraa	No that is not true, the AKC will not accept any mixed breeds into the club because there is still too much variation in the breed. The only "designer" breed which is even remotely close to becoming a recognised breed is the Australian Labradoodle, and that has been being bred (with purpose) since the 80's|`|W0buucLsaa	Uh, no. That's a mutt, not a breed. A mutt is a mutt is a mutt. You could have easily found a mutt like that in a shelter for a fifty dollar adoption fee. Your bro got scammed, big time.    You know that all pet store dogs come from puppy mills, right?|`|tPGxPDvBaa	haha!!!   No!!!    It takes decades to breed & develop a breed.  How caring of her to compare them to merchandise - flying off the shelves.  Only fools with too much money & not enough sense would buy mutts at inflated prices.  Once again sticking a cutesy name doesn't make it a breed or desirable.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Flying Pominos--that's scary. An OFFICIAL breed of what--suckers?? Yes that is possible.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	I be asking her to back up her bullsh!t with facts.  There is no way in the wide world that this cross breed is being made an official breed.  I'd be suing her for malicious misinformation.  It takes more than shoving 2 dogs together until they make puppies to bring into fruiting a legitimate recognised breed.    Your brother has bought, and ultimately financially ensured the continuation of a Puppy Mill somewhere.  His puppy's parents will be leading incredibly miserable lives - locked up in tiny cages, never coming out unless to mate and breed, never running across the grass in the sun, and living like this until they have passed their "use by" date when they will be dumped at an animal shelter to be destroyed.      Congratulate him for me on his unthinking support of Puppy Mills.|`|B462BQYzaa	just because the lady makes a few sales because the pup is cute does not make that particular breed and official breed - there are no standards for mix dogs.  Don't listen to her.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Nope,  it is a mutt & not a breed.|`|Toj8xh3laa	people can make up any breed they want by mixing them..no i've never heard of a pomimo....i had an eskimo and yorkie mix (which by the way looks like a westie)..i will tell you though that the AKC will not register these mixed breed dogs....sometimes the ukc or ckc will, but generally it takes a long time to establish it as a "breed" in the country|`|S9B8Fr4daa	Well this just means that your brother fell for a puppy mill or back yard bred dog.  No registry that is worth a hoot will be recognizing a 'Pomimo' mutt anytime soon.
NwwhSpYAaa	It is possible for complications to arise during labor for her. Take her to the vet and with an x-ray they can tell you if the puppies heads will be able to fit through her canal. It will also give you an idea of how many puppies will be in the litter.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes but it is better for you to discuss this with your vet & examine your options.  I would suggest a spay/abort.  There are literally many thousands of lab mixes & shepherd mixes.  They are two of the top mixes found & hard to place due to size, coloring & shedding.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Why are you breeding mutts?  Why??????  With all the dogs in the pounds all over the world putting thousands of dogs down several times a day, 24/7    You are one cruel person.  I am glade I do not know you.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	Even dogs who are same weight height etc.when bred together can have complications.  Birthing complications are solely based from dog to dog..  Larger dogs typically have an easier delivery than smaller dogs.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Well yes size can affect the birth, if the puppies are too large for her to carry it could be fatal for both the mother and the puppies. Take her to the vet NOW!! They are going to have to do an ultrasound.  I hope that you did not purposely mix breed your dog, but it sounds like you did. Shame on you. Get her fixed after the pups are weaned...that's if your dog doesn't die from complications.    That is pure irresponsibility you had to know she was in heat, you can not and I mean con not leave your dog that is in heat unattended outside, especially with a un-neutered male next door.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	It could cause problems yes I would take her ot the vet then make your neighbor pay for 1/2 the bills too. If the pups are too big they can get stuck. It would even kill them or your dog.|`|XavY3fiWaa	You might want to take you dog to the vet as soon as possible to make sure she can have her puppies without any complications.  Since this was your neighbors fault make them pay the vet bill or at least half of the vet bill.    Please get your dog spayed after the puppies are born.|`|Toj8xh3laa	she should be fine....my grandma had a 1/2 chihuahua 1/2 beagle that got bred by the neighbor's 1/2chow1/2lab...we took her to the vet, he said a dog's body is an amazing thing and that she should be fine..he said that if they are able to breed (no matter the size difference)  then they are able to carry and deliver..of course there are some exceptions such as english bulldogs and frenchies or bostons...any with the very thin hips usually require a c-section no matter what....good luck
U9Ol972Baa	I like Sugar,Mango,and Brownie the best!|`|c6gMZH33aa	It depends on the dog, really.

But this name will be with your puppy forever.  It also depends on how the dog looks and you can't just give a dog a name just because the name sounds cute.  It has to have a meaning.  I know that when I was getting a puppy i thought of mango, kiwi, angel and all those names but that has no meaning to it.      Maybe try something like leah ( that was good), emmy, luke, Asia, i dunno something that will be with them and have a meaning!

NMqHlGCaaa	get him to the vet right away, poor guy. some vets have emergency services 24 hours a day. they will advise you what is wrong and/or whether it is repairable or not. it may not be broken, perhaps he just twisted it wrong or something? or there may be another issue entirely. no way of knowing really until you take him in.  give him lots of love, make sure he is eating/drinking, keep him warm. if he is not eating and drinking, and being extremely lethargic, that is a sure sign he is quite ill.  good luck. i hope you don't have to lay him to rest, poor rattie :(|`|Dy4g6nOaaa	It may be hard to let any good friend go but depending on his other issues you may need to discuss this with a vet. If it is just his leg then he should be fine but if he has other health problems that may be fatal anyway then you may need to let him go.
u61yKsE3aa	Correct web site http://arachnophiliac.info/burrow/tcare....    Do you know if you have a male or female.  Males will die after the molt that makes them sexually mature   I would take your water dish out and not touch your tarabtula if it is still moving to it's dish it's not dead.  It takes 3 or more days for their exoskeleton to fully harden so they will be sluggish during this time and should not be handled that could possible why the hair is falling off but I'm not for sure on that part.  I'd give her a few days make sure she doesn't get too cold and do not touch her.  If she doesn't make it I'm sorry I know how attached you can get to these guys.  Hope this helps a little.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	probably cause you didnt feed her... but that is like the most heart breaking thing i have ever heard. and it gets me goosebumps cause i just barely got a new chilean rose hair! :*(|`|AA11853243	You didn't feed her?

vS1Z0inOaa	That's your problem :) No heat lamp and the water is cold...     In order to digest food, RES must have a basking area to go that is at least 10 degrees warmer than the water. If you don't have a heat lamp shining on his basking area, it's likely too cold there and he's not going to be hungry. That area should be about 90 degrees during the day.     69 degrees is too cold for a RES. Even if you change out his water and refill it with warm water, he's going to need a few days of stable warm water to get hungry. After a couple days of steady cold water their system starts to slow down and it's not going to "wake up" immediately when you put him in warm water. You really need to either turn your room temperature up or get him a heater and keep his water at about 72 to 75 degrees.     After making these adjustments, give him a week or so. He WILL start eating. There's no need to go to the vet unless you've kept him warm for a week and he's still refusing food.|`|ld2vmypNaa	http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...    water should be 80 degrees always or as you said he won't eat.  Heaters are like 18.00. You need the money email me and I will send you the $$.     These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. .|`|McnuekTBaa	There are many possible causes for lack of appetite in reptiles- the most common of which is being kept too cold. Check your temps.  Since you didn't give any clues as to how you're keeping it, anything else would just be a guess.  This site has lots of good info:  http://www.redearslider.com/
OKiMkaxGaa	It is true, sometimes we love our pets so much we don't think of them, only ourselves and we are selfish. No one ever wants to put their friend to sleep, but we have to act on a final act of love.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Your last sentence said it all.  As much as the vets would like to give the pets the relief, it is not their dog & not their choice.  I know quite a few dogs have been "lost" from surgeries or other procedures that the owners insist the vets do even there is no hope of the dog recovering or any quality of life if they do.  Too bad that dog had to suffer due to their inability to let go.  I applaud you for donating & try to assist this dog.  Too bad.|`|gypCmdWqaa	it is up to the owner.   it like if your wife is on life support ad the doc says they will never recover and there is np hope it is up to the husband or the nearest family member|`|eoZJO3J8aa	how sad.  it must be horrible for the lady to think that she has to let go of her dog.  maybe thats why she doesn't want to but him down. its terrible if i new my dog was in so much pain i would put him down. I know i would miss him/her alot but if there is nothing else we can do then good bye.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I have a hard time believing that the vets would give you all this info on another client of theirs? Something doesnt seem right. but maybe she loves this dog nad hates to let go or needs to think about it.|`|RyU2o8Tqaa	sadly pets are considered property and you can do whatever you like with your own property|`|5M5BFB5Caa	If an animal is being abused a vet can seize the pet.  However, if an owner has an old dog that's very sick, it's a tough call.  The owner has the rights to the dog and has the right to make the decision.  It may be selfish, but people sometimes need more time to accept that it's time for their pet's life to end, or think that it's better if they die at home.|`|c6gMZH33aa	Some people feel that they just cant live with themselves after putting their dog to sleep. It truly is a horrible feeling, and many people blame themselves. Some are just too attached to let them go.  They may be thinking irrationally, and not thinking about the dog being in pain, they would rather try to save it, so that they feel that they at least tried to help the dog, instead of giving up on him.  If it were my dog, and he were in that much pain, I would probably have him PTS.  But all people are different.|`|5CYfE9hMaa	How nice of you to offer to help financially, putting your beloved pet to sleep is sooo hard (said goodbye to my wonderfull Woofer-do last June after 14 years) it is selfish to prolong suffering but there are alsopeople who bring in young dogs to be euthenized just because they are no longer wanted.  This shouldn't be allowed either. Since she seems to repeat this behavior maybe you or the vet should report her to your local humane society, something sounds fishy about her. did she seem competent?
xyPpruSjaa	You could some how cut a hole in the screen lid? Or cut a hole in the glass? (lol I thought not xD)    Another, less stupid way, is to buy one of these lids:    http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...    Get the one with the black square in the middle, of course. The black square lifts away to reveal a hole that you can connect tubes to. That way, your gerbils won't be able to get out, and you'll still be able to connect tanks :D You can only order it off the petsmart website (because as you can see it says WEB ONLY) but it's probably worth it :D    Good luck! I'm glad you know the correct housing for your gerbils :] I have a 20 gallon tank for my gerbs.    If you have any questions or need any help email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com!|`|ojQER3hZaa	maybe one aquarium topper over both aquariums would work?....|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	the only thing i can think of is tubes..  but just look on google too!
YnCUyvK7aa	Goldfish don't always hold their top fin up like this  http://www.flickr.com/photos/frankphotos...  That's what they do if they're excited or scared.    Most of the time it's lower like this http://www.todayspet.com/images/goldfish... which is normal.  So they might not be anything wrong with him.    But just to be sure nothing is wrong and stays that way, check these points.    ~ make sure your fish has a large enough tank [at least 10 gallons, even when its a baby, and at least 20 gallons for 1 adult fancy, more if it's a common goldfish]  ~you should doing at least 25% weekly water changes  ~he has a good power filter on the tank  ~his water isn't too warm, 72 degrees or lower is best  ~see that he doesn't have any spots which could be a sign of ich  ~he should be fed a varied diet with pellets or flakes, bloodworms, and fresh veggies [lettuce, cucumber, squash, peas, orange slices http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/Goldfishs%2... ]|`|2Jmodoaeaa	Please, whatever you do, don't take it with electrical tape!

GHpcc5iKaa	Well when they get white stringy things on their fins and it stinks it probably means he has the ich. the ich is an infection from a microorganism that clings to the fish and reproduces from inside the fish causing him to literally be eaten alive. to cure this go to the pet store, get some de-ich and raise the water temp slightly. best of luck! by the way... when you add the de-ich make sure you put him in a separate tank and leave him in there for at least 24 hours. Then you may safely keep him in the tank.|`|vO7BVu43aa	well mine does not stink... you need to change the water to fix that problem.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	It's the water, not the fish. I hope you have him in a HEATED 2.5 Gallon+ aquarium, not a "Betta Bowl". Change the water if it smells funny. Remember not to add normal tap water, let the water sit out for atleast an hour.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	the smell is probly ammonia. Clean the tank.

I have two betta's not together of course. Good luck|`|2Jmodoaeaa	You can't just assume if it has water it's fine. Change it's water every week! Do you have at least a 2.5 gallon tank?

lyocWukKaa	good luck!|`|ltIuUBXNaa	What type of monitor do you have now? How big is your cage, are you thinking of keeping them together? Would they have compatible environmental requirements. Even baby monitors don't stay under a foot for long at all, especially if kept properly.|`|TkJn9gO0aa	I suggest you look at getting a bearded dragon or some other beginner reptile.     Or at the very least do proper research on the care and husbandry concerning BOTH species.    The fact that you think there are Green/Blue (There are Blue-Tailed)water monitors obviously alludes to your lack of experience.     Tree Monitors are for the more experienced people in the herpetoculture hobby that already have experience accumulated from various other monitor species.    Not only are the habitats of both the Savannah and Tree Monitors completely different, but there is the painstakingly obvious fact that the Sav is gonna rip the small tree monitor to shreds. Then add other cohabiting issues such as stress, space, humidites, and disease and you're just asking for trouble.    And are you honestly trying to acquire a monitor off of Y!Answers? Seriously? I suggest reading a book or two or three concerning individual care of each species you plan to get. And also, I recommend a ridgetail monitor (Red Ackie) for a first monitor.
w4DIPHf1aa	HOTS are garbage...    get any floor cannister you want..    if your asking for opinions I use really nothing but eheim classic canister filters.      good luck!!!|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	i have  HOT canister(for a 55gal tank) on my 29, and it barely keeps it clean, i have to add an additional bio sponge filter....    i wouldnt put it on a 45. if you have over loaded your tank, you will need a filter for close to a 65-70 gal tank...    much better off getting an Eheim.|`|Qwr3FvE6aa	Any floor canister is much better than a HOT in my opinion. They are much more quiet and efficient. However, I don't recommend Marineland canister filters. Although a bit more pricey, go with Rena Filstar XP2, or something like an Eheim.    But, if you're between those two, definitely go for the C-160|`|Ps8IqLXwaa	I swear by the magnum filters. One of mine i've had 15 years now and it was used when I got it..  They are portable, easy to use, whether hooking up the vaccume  hose and not having use a 5 gal bucket, or for a quick polish. It has been used for a saltwater tank, then  to used atto maintain 3 salmon raising tanks and office tanks at the schools, and then at home for my pirahna tank, or my 55 gal tropical community and exotics tank.

NLAek2bJaa	Snakes have a mind of their own. I am going through the same thing right now!! My red tail decided she did not want to eat for awhile and I know shes not shedding. I know she will later on. But, dont worry because snakes can go many months without food. They will eat when they want to. My ball python stopped eating for nine months. She was just fine! Try different techniques. Some snakes like eating in the dark only, others dont care! Some snakes like to eat without an audience. Mine would not eat it until I left the room. AND.. believe it or not, snakes have a preference on color of rats and gender try different kinds of rats! One trick that someone told me after those nine months of not eating, is to try a gerbil because they are more twitchy and catch the snakes attention. I could not believe it worked!!|`|cEh4LXAiaa	i think it stores his food in his tummy that's why its not eating|`|46Mxaw13aa	dont worry too much some balll pythons will go months wothout eating they are notorious for not eating between november to april and sometimes longer. u could try getting a gerbil and rub it on a mouse cuz ball pythons love them and u could also get some bedding from a gerbil and let the mouse run around in it for a few minutes so it gets the smell from the bedding, but i wouldn't feed it a gerbil cuz sometimes they will get hooked on gerbils and they may not want to eat anything else and they are like 10 or 15 bucks.|`|YvjTJPEfaa	Leave her be for a bit, Bo Pythons can go several months (especially in the winter) with out feeding.   Check the tank temperature at both ends it should range from 80F (26.6C)  one end to 90-95F (32.2-35C) at the other. Don't try to force feed the snake instead try piercing the skull of the mouse/rat and let some of the cranial fluid escape, snakes love the smell!|`|Ij6mharaaa	Does this snake ever lie stretched out near you, longways? Because if she does, this could be potentially dangerous for you. This same thing happened to my carpool's sister's friend, and when the vet found out it was lying longways near her, he figured out that it was fasting and stretching in an attempt to swallow her. This might not be the case with yours, but I'd definitely see a vet.|`|dYutdYUQaa	I wouldn't worry too much, I have a Red Tail Boa that went  a few months without eating and  i tried frozen and live rats and nothing. It scared me too but I was told it could possibly be two things. If your snake is female it might be in heat and it could also be because its winter some snakes will stop eating. Hope everything works out. I would also check if your snake is getting ready to shed.|`|altDLtTKaa	it's ok, snakes can eat every 4 to 6 weeks, sometimes they wait three months perfectly... but sometimes when they are sloughing off their skin (shed) they don't eat, u can watch it because the eye become like gray or blue, but in that period u have to be careful because they get blind...
W0buucLsaa	You can get interest-free financing for veterinary care with a Care credit card: http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed/whycc.h...    You can also ask around with animal shelters and rescue organizations and see if they know of any vets that will perform surgeries at cost - this is a bit of a long shot though. You can also shop around for a less expensive vet (I'd do this even with the interest-free financing). Or shop around for a vet that will let you finance it.    You can also hock stuff on eBay, if you have any jewelry, electronics, stuff like that.    Good luck.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Are you near any Universities that teach Veterinary Medicine? We had a clinic at Champagne, Illinois. It's a teaching hospital. No one will experiment. The doctors there are full veterinarians, completing their practice before graduation. The usually will do extensive surgeries like that for a fraction of the cost. I studied Veterinary technician there for two years and the are incredible, I've taken some of my rescues (pit bulls) there and so far I've had no problems with anything they've done from heartworm treatment to fractured patellas to an amputation.|`|yrXcDwTRaa	i dont think soo sorry to say im soo sad for you and your dog good luck|`|9UttDvcsaa	Usually vet office offer something like "credit care" that is a payment plan sort of like a credit card but you have to get approved.  If your dogs hip is shattered maybe they can remove the pieces and cut the ball and he would have a hip but no ball and socket, my dog with horrible hips is a candidate for this.  You have options ask what else can be done besides a 4-6 thousand dollar surgery and check out other vets and what they can do. Those x-rays are YOURS they belong to you, you paid for them.  Take them around to other vet clinics and see what they charge/recommend.   Sometimes you can get the xrays on a dvd and you can send them around.  Best of luck to you and your dog, he is lucky to have you.    **To get a FULL hip replacement surgery at Gulf Coast Animal Hospital (one of the best in the U.S) is 4,000 dollars so I think your vet is a tad high.  Good Luck!|`|YV1bOajXaa	So sorry to hear about your dog.  Looks like you have received some excellent suggestions.  I have Care Credit - got it when our puppy had to have surgery on her leg - $800!   Good luck.|`|I38WF5aFaa	Euthanize him now.  It isn't worth going into debt for an animal.  Even if you could afford it he will develop arthritis at a young age and become crippled.  Do you want him to go through that?  Do the right thing and end his life.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I don't know of anywhere that does this ask the vets office. Hope you can find a way, sorry about his accident.|`|Toj8xh3laa	is there a local pet organization in your area? we have ARF, they might know where you can get some help...sorry, i don't know of any other resources....some vets will let you pay monthly payments you just need to ask...most of them don't want to put an animal down if it has a good chance to make it :)|`|5Up1iL3Saa	I don't know of one. But if i were you I would talk to the doctor and see if I could set up a payment plan with them.|`|jfbF4MOOaa	I did some research on this topic and came up with some websites that may help in dire situations. Most of these places that DO help will only help for SERIOUSLY urgent situations, not run of the mill just looking for vet bill coverage. Some of these places offer extra aid for elderly or disabled as well.

That's why it's sometimes good to get accidental insurance on Pets.|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	I am sooo sorry for you and your dog. I just paid $4,000 and my dog still isn't right.  I was lucky to have a credit card that I could charge this to.  Can you talk to your credit card company for a higher credit limit?    I took my dog to MedVets when he broke his own leg. That was $4,000 and a year later he still has a horrible limp. They would not touch him until I paid which meant that I had to go home get a credit card and call them back. 1 1/2 hrs after he broke his leg they decided they'd do something for him.    I don't intend to scare you just be very wary of MedVets. Our city,   has other emergency vets that do it for less I've found out since and I can't imagine that it wouldn't be done better.     His treatment by a Vet Tech was mean. She dragged him as fast as she could go out to our car. Him just out of surgery a couple hours or so before,  plopped his bandaged leg down in a pile of snow slush, shoved him across the SUV seat barely missing the seat belt holders with his paws, swished around and as she left told me I could report her to HR if I wanted to.    I really wonder how he was treated behind their doors where owners aren't allowed to go.  .  All this after arrogant attitudes by other employees, desk help and another  Vet Tech. This place was recommended by my Vet     I'd like to suggest that everyone with a pet find an emergency vet before you need it. Make a dry run to it so you'll know exactly where it is, what door to use etc. Scout out how they treat people and their dogs, the costs etc prior to needing it. Sooner or later you probably will need it.  Read online reviews of where you intend to go.    MedVet employees have a dollar quota that they have to meet every day. This VT had to bring in $400 per day. Their online reviews are mediocre. Read afterwards, of course.
82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	I'm sorry but it just really irritates me to see people come on here with a dollar amount that they want to spend for a dog. First of all there are thousands of animals that need a good home for a little of nothing. But do keep in mind, these pets are expensive to raise. It doesn't matter if you get a free one or give $400.00 (which is your limit) You have food, vaccinations, medical cost if that get sick or hurt which could be THOUSANDS of DOLLARS. Are you prepared for that? If not, then please don't get a dog, EVEN at a shelter.|`|oGVWdnHraa	http://www.petfinder.com  :)|`|AA12069383	Maltese or Yorkie rescues. Google to see if there are any in your local area.|`|CHPuhiOyaa	Have you looked into rescues or adoptions? A LOT of dogs without a home, just as good, but essentially free or cheap.|`|lxDCjBM7aa	go to yahoo and type in yorkie rescue. theres a ton of homeless yorkies that could use ur help|`|XagPxe7Faa	I would like a Mercedes Benz for under $400, but that's probably not going to happen either.    Seriously, puppies are not cheap because breeding ethically is not a cheap venture.  Breeders have costs invested in their dogs--vet bills, medical testing, cost of their stock, grooming supplies, etc--that they have to cover by charging for the puppies they place.  As the saying goes, you can't get something for nothing.    If your funds are limited, then your best bet is to check with local sheters or breed specific rescue organizations.  Otherwise, you are likely going to have to bite the bullet and save your money for one, just like everyone else.|`|K97esxDsaa	Go to a shelter or a breed rescue.    Cheap puppies you find on the internet or in a newspaper will likely be from irresponsible breeders and you have no idea how healthy the dog will be or if it will have behavioral issues.    http://www.yorkierescue.com/  http://www.unitedyorkierescue.org/    http://adopt-a-maltese.adoptapet.com/  http://adopt-a-yorkie.adoptapet.com/    http://www.petfinder.com
NbvTyN7saa	Never met one that I loved.  There was one herbal one on the market a few years ago that was just ok but not seen it in a long time.       Collars are illogical.  Fleas cover an animal not just sit on their neck and to put neurotoxins next to an animals main area of input (nose and mouth) is not bright.    Sargent is pretty useless.  Herbal remedies and Frontline are the best defence.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Useless.    NEVER USE ANYTHING FROM SARGENTS OR HARTZ|`|NWOKZKzOaa	Stay with the frontline flea collars dont work whatsoever|`|XNIkS3KNaa	I've tried on my dogs and it doesn't really work.  Giving them regular flee dips and using the Frontline stuff is your best bet.  If you really get desperate and you want to spend the money there's shots or pills that can be given from the vet to prevent flees.  Those really work, but they do cost.  Hope I helped some. :)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No they are worthless. In fact some of them can be toxic if your dog chews on them. Don't waste your money.  Stick with Frontline if it is working & shop around for prices. You can check with site.  I buy my flea stuff from & have very pleased.    https://fsdpets.com/catalog/index.php?os...|`|d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	nope, not only are they not effective, they cause more neurological problems than all the other flea preventatives combined.     spend the extra few bucks, and use frontline.     AND, get the weight off your lab.|`|abe3a088372b8dd127779b9d035e5efbaa	In my experience, ive tried many differant brands and ive never had one that worked. Frontline is the best there is, if it getting too expensive maybe checkout ebay and 1800 pet meds, Otherwise spot on treatments have a somewhat good reputation for working and you cut the price in half. Just look up reveiws for the differant brands because they can be tricky, you can make your pet sick with too much and they wash away if your pet gets wet.
xoXkHOVsaa	I have a chihuahua.  They are very protective of their owners and scare easily.  Mine loves to play with little dogs, but hates big dogs.      Your sister needs to socialize her chihuahua with other small dogs so it gains confidence.  Any visits with your pit bull puppy should be supervised.  They may never get along, or they may end up best friends.  It depends on their personalities and how much work you put in to it.|`|k0qTaSceaa	i dont know my friend chihuahua always had a bad temperment like a not friendly dog but that varies from dog to dog. also my teacher has a daucshand and a pit bull and they are perfectly fine together. so you can work on it
TdSaXkFSaa	Spay or neuter it. If you talk to your vet there are some prescriptions but they aren't just for if the dog is a little rowdy like all puppies- they're for more serious matters. However, you never know if your pup may have puppy ADHD or something! What I would suggest, is if you can afford another dog and the one you have isn't hostile to other dogs, get another one. If you can't afford it, take the dog for a walk and throw a ball around for a few minutes or take it to a nearby dog park. They will play with other dogs and then will be worn out. It's the oldest trick in the book. And to all those people saying you are a bad owner for asking a question, there's nothing wrong with that. Puppies, kittens, children... they all get on our nerves and in some situations there does need to be a little bit of a helping hand. Before you put them on medication though, I would try the other suggestions.|`|Z6qF3353aa	You have to play with it, give it toys that can be torn apart.  You can't give a puppy a pill to make it calm down.   If you can't handle the animal, then find it a new home with someone who knows how to work with high energy dogs.|`|AA12069383	No. But here's a question for you: Ever thought of giving up your puppy to someone with a little more of an understanding heart?|`|YV1bOajXaa	Yes, it's call You.  You play with the puppy and it gets tired and calms down.  Good luck|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Thats all puppies. I sure hope you don't have children. Rehome the dog and do it a fovor.|`|LdBt4ZWvaa	well a responsible dog owner would understand that puppies are puppies. but if your dogs has any kind of anxiety (for example, seperation anxiety) there are pills available. my dog has that condition where he gats very stressed out and scared when i leave. he gets the pill daily and he is fine. but that is with the condition, if your dog is tested negative on anxiety, just learn to live with t or give the poor thing to a family that can handle it.   also...try some obedience training, something difficult, or agility. and keep it on a daily schedule often puppies are restless because they are not on a set schedule and do not understand yet. do something challenging and get their mind working.|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Training, playing and socialisation is the answer, not pills.  Pills are not the answer to everything as some folk seem to think they are.    That's what puppies are like....it's normal.  What did you expect?    I can't believe you want to drug a puppy. Put the work in to train and exercise your pup.  Tired puppies are sleepy and relaxed.    If you're not up to the challenge of raising a puppy then please rehome it to someone who is.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	Maybe you need the pill and the dog needs a new home.|`|HHD7Sc32aa	no  - is there a pill that we can give bad dog owners to make them realize they shouldnt own a dog?
AA10470681	I think you are going to have to supervise their play. It's only normal for your Lab to want to play. I imagine she thinks you just got her   "The Best Toy Ever".     I would sit down on the floor with them and gently but firmly tell your Lab to be Gentle or Nice. Just pick a key word and be consistent with it. If I know dachshunds he will soon feel comfortable enough to be telling your Lab what's what. But in the meantime and considering the age of your Lab I think they will need an extra bit of supervision. Might want to have the video camera ready, I bet your going to have some wonderful and funny times with them.|`|YV1bOajXaa	You should closely supervise their play because of just what you said - their size difference and a nine month old is still a puppy herself!
abe3a088372b8dd127779b9d035e5efbaa	You dont notice a real differance until somewhere between 2-3, they just stay plain hyper. One option you could use is obedience training, it helps if you work seriously with your dog, but alot of people who do training with there dogs tech it to sit and maybe stay and dont understand why it didnt work. A dog that respects you and listens to your every command wont be so crazy and overactive. I have a friend with a 8 month old golden and the dog looks at her constantly for direction on what it can and cant do.|`|GVZsit7Qaa	Most retrievers dont calm down till about 2-3 years, but it depends on the dog really, Ive seen some pretty mellow 1 year old golden retrievers, but other wise theyre very hyper. Just get some training in, and you'll be fine.|`|IGfnrfGPaa	Pits grow up when they are about 3. Just make sure he has plenty of exercise and that he has bones (real ones, cow, no birds) available, this will help keep him from chewing up your stuff. Mine loved to go after everything and doing those things stopped that habit.|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Never haha they always stay like puppies. :)|`|VxKH7KHmaa	lol without proper obedience training....never, they will always be a high energy breed!!|`|K7BjKJgoaa	Dogs in general begin to noticeably mellow out around age two.

px27V5N9aa	Is your horse boarded at a barn with other horses?  Does your horse get the flu and rhino vaccine?  Is your horse running a fever?  Is your horse dull acting?  Head hanging down a little?  Not interested in his surroundings?  Was he sluggish when you rode him?  Is he coughing at all?  How is his appetite?  Is he drinking well?    What to do:  Stall him, keep others away from him.  When you touch him don't go touching areas that other horses are exposed to.  Wash your hands between horses.  He is 'quarantined' now.    If he drank out of a tank of water outside and other horses have been drinking from it, they most likely are now exposed.  That tank should be bleached.    Call the vet.  He will most likely prescribe SMZ or Tucoprim.  Banamine for fever.  You may want to provide water with electrolytes along with another bucket of clear water.  Make warm mashes for him.    He prob has the flu/rhino and it will run it's course with antibiotics.  Just practice cleanliness and don't ride him til he's 100%|`|q9Dg8BdFaa	Gunky yellow sstuff is a sign that the horse is sick, It may have a cold. You should call the vet.

The fact that your horse's discharge is "gunky" and "yellow" is probably a sign of a more serious problem (not necessarily a huge one, but more serious that your average allergy). If it doesn't go away after a day or two or your horse has other symptoms (fever, lethargy, cough, wheezing sounds when breathing, etc.) I'd get a vet out ASAP. You don't want to risk infecting other horses, either, so early treatment will be essential.|`|UhiRrojoaa	If he has had it less than two days I wouldn't worry. Anything after that call a vet, and take him to the clinic or have one come out. Don't wait too long, and if you have him around any other horses seperate him asap.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Could be many things.  It could be a cold, allergies, or a more serious problem.    My mare had an ongoing runny nose for about two years, never gave her any problems.  The vet said it was fine and didn't bother her at all, and saw it several times but always said she wasn't sick and so not to do anything.  Finally we were sick of wiping a snotty nose all of the time so we gave her some spec-u-tuss and the problem went away quickly.  Try that before calling the vet out.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	A thick yellow discharge means infection. Flu, strangles, and guttural pouch or sinus infections are the most common producers of this type of discharge.  The vet should be called so that a diagnosis can be made and treatment, if any, can be started. Don't give any medications not prescribed by the vet.  Antibiotics don't work for viral infections, and if it is strangles, antibiotics are sometimes not given due to the risk of developing bastard strangles.  In the meantime, take precautions against it spreading in case it is communicable to other horses, and don't ride the horse.  Any horses he has been with are already exposed, but keep him away from any he hasn't already contacted.  Feed plenty of hay and be sure the horse has ample water and is drinking it. Don't feed anything new which would upset his digestive system and further stress him. Add water to his regular feed if he isn't drinking enough (about10 gallons a day is average)  If you have a thermometer, take his temperature and be prepared to list all symptoms to the vet on the phone when you call.  Add.....also, check for firm swelling beneath and between his jaws at the throat area, and be sure to tell the vet what you find.  This could be an abscess associated with strangles.  If you feel any crusty or wet substance, it is most likely a draining abscess and would indicate strangles, and the exudate is contagious and you should wash well after contacting it.|`|uVgqDlrcaa	Oh gawd, don't ride when that happens!!    Apparently he's ill!! Don't ride an ill horse.    Jeezus.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Gutteral pouch infection, strangles.. whatever it is you need to see a vet! And you should not ride him until you find out what it is.  It could just be a cold, but I would check it out in case it is contagious

A super premium food will not cause a dog to smell.  Or a raw BARF diet doesn't cause a dog to smell.    It's the cheap supermarket foods and some foods that the vets sell that cause doggy smell.    I'm guessing you are talking about the 'doggy smell' rather than bad breath which can also be caused by food...or bad teeth.|`|S7Demh3Raa	dogs have natural oils that come off them that create an odor. it has nothing to do with how well you bathe them it is naturally going to be that way. some breeds smell worse then others    for instance hound breeds always have bad odor|`|abe3a088372b8dd127779b9d035e5efbaa	Could be the anal glands, alot of smaller dog sometimes need help expressing these, vets and groomers with do this for you. Could be something else too, tooth decay has a strong odor you sometimes smell when just near the dog, Alot of cocker spaniels get ear infections and can just smell horrible even right after the bath.    Also bathing a dog weekly especially in the winter is probably creating dry itchy skin, very uncomfortable for the dog, though wouldnt create the smell.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	He could have dental problems and needs a dental cleaning, could be a skin infection or ear infection, could be anal glands, could be poor diet.      BTW, you are bathing too often and can be contributing to the problem.  Dogs don't need to be bathed but once a month - if that.    A slight "doggy" odor is normal, but you should have your vet give him a check up.|`|Wy4Q1eeuaa	Actually, bathing him WEEKLY is probably WHY your dog smells - bathing him so often does not allow enough time to build up an oil barrier on his skin opens up the risk of skin infections, and prevents him from easily being able to shed rain, dirt and debris. Bathing too often is actually counterproductive to keeping a dog clean and less smelly. Also, if you are not rinsing him well enough during bathing, the soap particles left in his coat will also attract dirt, and further irritate the skin.    Vintage Collies
c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Depends...    The 7-way vaccine covers:  canine distemper, adenovirus cough, hepatitis, parainfluenza, parvovirus, and two (or four) types of leptospirosis.     The 5-way vaccine covers:  canine distemper, hepatitis, adenovirus cough, parainfluenza, and parvovirus.    Coronavirus may or may not be included.    Best way to know the vaccines your dog has recieved, is to check the vet record (if you do not get a printed version of what was done, call the vet!)    Drowsiness after a vaccine can occur, but not sure about the shivering. I would call the vet to find out if he needs to be seen.|`|ALNOT9ELaa	rabies, distemper, etc. Its called 7 in 1|`|nI8G21y8aa	hmmm, well my dogs always get the rabies shotts every year because they are on a lot of land, with lots of other wild animals.  And the rabies vaccine is the only one required by law.    but just remember that some dogs get allergic reactions to shots, they sometimes have to be immediately brought back to the vet because their reaction was SO bad they couldn't breathe.|`|LGpv2grIaa	It would be nice if all of these vaccinations could be handled with a single, quick injection right after the puppy is born.   here is an article about and list of dog vaccines..    http://dogtime.com/vaccinations.html|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	If you want to know exactly what your dog got for vaccines you need to ask your vet. They will know exactly what they gave. You also need ot alert your vet to the fact that your dog is having a reaction to the vaccines. This is very important and needs to be put in your dogs records for future reference.    Vaccinations should not be given yearly anyway. Yearly vaccination is no longer recommended by any of the vet schools or the AAHA.  It is also not recommended to give the lepto or bordatella (kennel cough) vaccinations to all dogs only those at high risk of exposure. The coronavirus vaccine should NOT be given to ANY dog/puppy ever.
OJ0POy4Xaa	You should get him neutered, but it's becoming a more common practice to wait until the dog is 8-12 months because of behavioral issues that may arise from pediatric neutering.   He really should be in pain the first day or two.   At only 4 months old it's pretty standard that he's still a really good dog, he hasn't matured and he's still a baby. The "scared of everything" issue is one of the problems on pediatric neutering. My male Great Dane was neutered by his previous owners at 12 weeks and he is a real weenie.   But unless you plan to show or have a responsible breeding program it's always best to have your pet fixed.   For a male dog that small, I would guess you shouldn't have to pay more than $100 for it. Look for a low cost neuter clinic, or visit your local Humane Society to see if you could get a voucher.   Good luck!|`|XavY3fiWaa	Definetly get him neutered, When your puppy gets older he could accidently get to a female dog and get her pregnant.  Of course he is still shy because he is still a baby but that baby will be an adult and a male dog that isn't neutered will want to run away alot trying to find a mate.  There are millions of homeless pets in shelters being put to sleep because of people not spaying or neutering their pet,   If you truly are a responsible pet owner you won't let that happen.    My female dog wasn't in pain when we got her spayed.  There are lots of places that have low cost Spay/Neuter programs that usually cost around $50.  You could probably get him neutered now or real soon.         Spay/Neuter Prevent a Stray|`|7ZNFtNTMaa	yes, you should    if you don't want the hundreds of little puppies, i think you should.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes have him neutered.  I would wait til 6mo before doing but not much longer after that age.  You want to do it before the hormones really start kicking in with the marking etc.  It is more healthy for them to be fixed & you don't have to worry about any accidental breedings.  Prices depend on the vet & you can go to low cost clinic. They should be under $100 for neuter but go wherever you feel comfortable.|`|y0cbLn0Yaa	The only really good reason that I can come up with for neutering a dog is that you are not responsible enough to ensure that your dog does not EVER contribute to the over population of dogs already in the world looking for good forever homes.  If you can't 100% guarantee that, even when you think that your dog is jus the most beautiful pet that ever walked the planet, then you should get your pet neutered.    Also, if your dog has extreme behavioural issues, particularly aggression which may be helped by neutering, then go for it.  Neutering is not a magic bullet in CURING all behavioural problems, but it may help, along with training.    Yes, there are health benefits in neutering - a dog can't get cancer of what it no longer has.  However, there are also health risks in neutering, particularly neutering before the age of 1 in large / giant breeds.    Essentially, you need to do your research.   Look at both sides of the argument and work out what is best for your dog.    As I said before though, if you can't 100% guarantee that your dog won't be bred - accidentally or on purpose - then get it neutered.|`|OUcQjqI0aa	if you don't plan on breeding him, yes, get him fixed.  check with your local humane society, they can help you find an inexpensive vet for the procedure.|`|C4AUC5vGaa	yes, and at the vet I go to it would cost $170  If you don't neuter him a side effect will be him marking the house, and possibly running away when he smells a dog in heat|`|503f82e81abb8901e8e1451d174089feaa	Yes.You should.And as soon as possible another 4 months and he will be old enough to breed even a timid dog will change at breeding time.You can call around for the best price,all vets charge different.Your dog will be laying around for about 3 days then he will be fine,They don't usually get a problem or infection unless he licks it too much just get the hood the vet will recommend it and you will be fine.But by all means get your dog nutered.There are millions every year put down because people didn't do that one thing,so sad.|`|RyU2o8Tqaa	all domesticated animals should be fixed.. too many unwanted cats and dogs are destroyed every year and every un-fixed animal is playing a part in the problem, unless your willing to take in and care for every pup your dog produces, get it fixed.|`|LGpv2grIaa	Many, many wonderful health and behavioral effects occur because he's undergone "the big snip."
4wRVxL6Xaa	Of course not.. you should definitely not do that. Wait until they are at least 8 to 12 weeks when they are able to take care of themselves.. make sure that you don't do it too early because it might make the puppy go into shock..      You also posted this under cats. Do you really have a dog? Get your dog spayed/neutered.|`|oGVWdnHraa	I wouldnt bathe them because puppys at that age arent able to regulate their body temperatures very well yet so they could easily get chilled, I would wait at least another 3 weeks :)|`|W4Dek41Jaa	Go talk to your    VETERINARIAN.

And EVERY dog is different.|`|GB4zo5r4aa	no you will have to wait until it is at least 4 weeks old but bathe it in a sink (depending on the breed) with worm water but no shampoo. when it is about 8-10 weeks u can start bathing it shampoo and in a bigger tub.   --reported from a future veterinarian and breeder--|`|abe3a088372b8dd127779b9d035e5efbaa	I wouldnt recommend it, it would be very stressful to the puppy and you never know how mothers with react to there puppy suddenly smelling like something else. Mother should be keeping them clean enough. Also they dont sell many if any dog shampoos for puppies that young and any human or dish soap will be too strong for the puppy and create skin issues, If the mother isnt taking as good of care as she should and they are getting feces or anything else on them id just take a damp towel and clean them as best you can that way. good luck.|`|aC5yIcvqaa	No.  their mother still takes care of all of their hygiene needs at 2 weeks.  giving them a bath could kill them.  please wait until they can eat food on their own and are not nursing.  then you can give them a bath.|`|m5aqFpeEaa	no, well you can, but i would wait until it is atleat 5 weeks to be positively sure and not harm the poor little thing...|`|XywHOzKCaa	Thats a very bad idea. Wait until about 10 weeks. When they can actually handle where they are, and they'll know what's going on. 2 weeks is far to early....|`|ARalIeGsaa	I don't think it would be safe. At 2 weeks old the mother would be still 'taking care' of it. Your best bet is to wait until the puppy is at least 6 weeks old. And I believe they have to be 3+ months before you can use flea shampoo. If the puppy is seriously needing a bath now though, you may could call the vet and ask them about it.  If you do have to bathe it, just make sure he/she stays warm and kept right close to it's mom.  But seriously it just is not safe at 2 weeks old. The puppy could easily get phnemonia and die. Better to wait until the puppy is 6+ weeks before even thinking about it maybe even 8 to 10 weeks.|`|ztPf92rJaa	No, dont do that you can use a damp wash cloth to wipe them off or you can use baby wipes they also make puppy wipes, but please no baths yet way to young. Mom will clean them up|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> No    > Their mother can do it    > Bath them when their 10 weeks|`|8l52BsB1aa	Two weeks is REALLY young. I wouldn't suggest giving them one unless something tragically nasty had happened to them.  If something has, wash pups in water just above warm but not too hot water (dogs like warmer water then we do), wash quickly with mild shampoo and dry thoroughy with a blowdryer as for them not to get cold.  Wash one at a time, dry one at a time    ---from an experienced dog owner---
2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Rottweilers are very susceptible to Parvo.  Has your pup had all his  vaccinations?    I've also heard of Tamiflu being used for parvo but I don't know if it's successful.  You may like to do a search on Parvaid.  There is a company in the USA that claims this product works and I've heard good reports from people who have used it for their dogs.    I hope your puppy pulls through and beats this horrible virus. I have Rottweilers too, they are wonderful dogs.  Best of luck.|`|q17Zlq1Zaa	i don't know anything about Tamiflu,as some people used it on people having the flu:did not have the desired "effect".  I see something,called:Parvaid-this is a supplement,NOT a medication,and being advertised in dog magazines.  Leave the puppy at the vet,Parvo is very infectious and don't worry about feeding him:this virus damages the small intestine,so let his system rest,no food,no water.Let the vet treat the pup with I.V. drugs,as eating/drinking will start up the vomiting+diarrhoea.  Its a good sign,if the puppy is alive after 3 days.  i have worked at a vet,dogs can die from Parvo in 24hrs.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	My vet has told me there has been some experimentation with Tamiflu in dogs with parvo and that its use has not really been proven as effective.  If you can get it, it may be worth a try but there are no clear studies that definitively prove that it really is effective.  So consider it an experimental treatment if you decide to go forward and don't beat yourself up if you can't find it available where you are.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	I worked as a vet tech for years and we had amazing success adding Tamiflu into regimens for parvo dogs. Tamiflu is a refrigerated medicine administered orally by Rx only. Since your insurance won't cover it, be prepared to spend some cash. If the Caribbean doesn't carry it you can have it mail ordered. There are specific pharmacies that will mail. Try Island Pharmacy, they specialize in animal medications (Not PetMed!!).  Tamiflu is relatively new to most vets so you might need to bring the research to your vet for the prescription. As a side note Rottweilers are very prone to contracting parvo. A good way to combat this is to administer an extra DHLPP or Parvo vaccine. For instance give a 4 shot series instead of 3.  As far as being concered about overnight staff I can tell you that even if it was fully staff, if a parvo dog takes a turn for the worse there isn't much that can be done on the spot. It is a definate waiting game. I wish you the best of luck and good for you for seeking vet attention so soon!|`|sN1wdgDJaa	At the animal hospital I work at I have not heard of using Tamiflu. We administer IV fluids, antibiotics and keep them warm. If they are having vomiting and diarreah we give reglan injectable or tablets and kaopectic with paragoric. If the vomiting stops then we offer water, if no vomiting after 30 mins then we offer  prescription diet ID groul (Id w/water). We also have a product called nutrical is a vitamin supplement.  Parvo is a horrible disease and I'm sorry your puppy has it. We don't have 24 hour care at our hospital either. (another diet we use is homemade bland diet of boiled chicken and rice or boiled hamburger and rice) small frequent amounts. Let me know how your puppy does. It can take intense treatment and hospitalization to treat parvo.

(21 days)|`|siE3TpgFaa	About 6 months depending on breed and health.  And she is old enough to be spayed.   Please do NOT make the mistake of thinking it is the right thing to do to make her have a litter. You should know that for every litter born, most pups don't make it into good "forever" homes. Anyone in the field of animal rescue and humane societies will tell you the truth: "Every litter hurts."  Spayed dogs also have far less health issues later in life. It is a myth that they get fat from being spayed. They get fat because their owners don't feed them high quality food in the right amount, and don't exercise and play with them enough.|`|OJ0POy4Xaa	Generally around 6 months, but some giant breeds are known to be as old as 24 months for their first heat.|`|zb3ImEQ6aa	Depending on breed and genetics anywhere from 6 to 9 months but as already stated Other breeds Giants such as Great Danes can goas long as 24 months before their first heat. There are many factors that can change the normal.  If you dont plan on breeding its best to get them fixed before the mess of a first heat ( and the trouble of keeping male dogs away) And if you are planning on breeding its best to wait till the dam is 2 years of age fully grown and mature.|`|5jfEQAlwaa	The normal is 6--9 months. But  just keep an eye on her and then keep track. My girls first heat was at 9 months and then every six months since.|`|K7BjKJgoaa	Six months in general, but, it varies by breed.  You'll need to get your dog spayed before then, to avoid pregnancy and unwanted behaviors.
AQsiugSpaa	Lanie,    I am glad you posted this question on YA! It shows that you are ambivolent about declawing. The reason I say this is I am sure you could call vets in your area, to learn costs. What I suspect is the part of you that is against declawing is reaching out for alternatives, and deep down inside you *do* know it is wrong.    So I am reaching out to that side of you here, as have just about every other person who has replied. I am thrilled to read that folks are understanding what a bad idea declawing is. Hopefully in the U.S. this barbaric practice will be banned the way it is in many other countries around the world.    Not only is it a brutal surgery, with long recovery that is painful and often results in paw disfigurement,  cats need their claws. That is why God gave them to cats.    Even indoor cats can escape out the front door, so are vulnerable to attacks from other animals, so without claws they have no first line defenses.  Years ago, I adopted a declawed cat. a pedigreed Siamese who needed a home since she could not be shown. While she could not scratch furniture, she had developed a habit of chewing on everything, leaving little toothmarks in lampshades, window shades and other items in our home. I think that "scratching" instinct  which remains must be rather frustrating for declawed cats, so they find other outlets. She also chewed on nylon, and wool, also related to being declawed.    Kittens in particular  can easily be trained not to maul furniture, if provided with the necessary scratching devices, high enough or long enough for them to stretch out completely. With patient and consistent kitty training, all cats can eventually learn to leave furniture alone. My couches and carpets are in pristine shape and we have two very active outgoing cats, with all claws intact. They do their "work" on their scratching posts and other devices for that purpose, liberally placed around the house.    Perhaps you are not aware that  "declawing",  is not  just removing the nails. Take a second to look at your fingers, and imagine the first digit with the nail being amputated.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaEx-qe2w...    Have you discussed the procedure thoroughly with your vet, and talked about alternatives?Just remember that claws are not just used for climbing, "they are used are used for balance, for exercising, and for stretching the muscles in their legs, back, shoulders, and paws" Cats need their claws for many things.    Soft claws work great. They cover the nails and cats can still do their "cat thing" without harming furniture and carpets. Also get a cat tree that is made mostly of sissal, which is very attractive to cats. Trees that are mostly covered with carpet are not as effective and also confuse cats about the difference of carpet on their tree and carpets on the floor. Learning to trim your kitten's nails since she still is young is easy and takes just a few minutes of your time to do.    Trust me! You and your kitten will be a lot happier not having this surgery performed.     So again, I am glad you asked for opinions. Let that part of you that is against doing this win the decision.    Troublesniffer  Owned by cats for over 40 years  Freelance writer/blogger for:  http://www.petside.com/the-sidewalk/|`|Jguzosm2aa	In my opinion, yes.     Declawing is a traumatic, painful and debilitating procedure which can be compared to having your fingers cut off at the first knuckle. To remove the claw, part of the toe is removed. It is not unheard of for cats to experience lasting pain, requiring medication throughout their life. Should your cat get lost, it will not be able to forage for food, defend itself, or climb to escape danger. You may intend to keep them indoors - which is good - but this doesn't mean they will never manage to get out.    Scratching posts may be enough to solve the problem. You can even buy them to fit against the corner of furniture. for climbers, save up and buy a cat tree. If this is not enough, nail caps are another option. They're relatively cheap, come in packages which last more than one use, and are harmless to the cat. They will wear off, so your cat is not doomed should it get outside. They also allow enough grip that a cat can still hunt with ease and defend itself just fine.    There are a number of medical and behavior problems associated with declawing. Declawed cats may experience lasting pain where the toes were removed, and the pain of scratching or digging in litter can be associated with the litter box itself, prompting cats to use soft material such as carpet, clothes or furniture to relieve themselves. Declawed cats, having lost the defense of their claws, are known for biting, and hard, in warning instead of a little swat. The removal of the toes and claws prevents them from getting vital exercise from stretching. Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. It is not uncommon for join problems to develop in cats who are declawed. Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints.    The costs really outweigh the benefits, and it's an expensive procedure that cannot be reversed if you change your mind. You wouldn't want the tops of your fingers removed, and neither does your cat. I think that about sums up how wrong declawing is.|`|AA10091923	lanie-  i will not speak of the pros and cons here...but if you want more opinion from me, you can email me.    also please do research on this before making a decison.  cost?  call the vet to find out - each is different.    you may get some very strong responses regarding this issue - so if you want more impartial info, please do not hesitate to contact me.    thanks, good luck  :)|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Personally, I find it completely ''selfish'' to get a kitten declawed. Kittens are trainable, and have not been ''set in their ways'' yet. It just takes dedication to teach the kitten what's appropriate to scratch, and what isn't.    Please read this website for a better view of what declawing consists of, before making your decision:  http://www.declawing.com/    Declawing is pure ''convenience'', except for some rare cases where the cat is truly destructive despite training attempts. It should be a last resort....    As for cost, I have no clue. It would vary from city to city, anyways. You'd have to call around to your local vets to find out the average cost in your area.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	READ THIS.......and see if you still feel the same way !!    http://maxshouse.com/Truth%20About%20Dec...    Put this in your "bookmarks", so you can refer to it again, if you forget what it says, or if you want to show it to someone else........    Hope you reconsider.  Furniture can be replaced, TOES CANNOT !!|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Yes, it's very wrong of you.    Do you realize what goes into declawing? It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.    Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't put your furniture over your cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming. Please read more on this awful procedure before you consider it:  http://www.declawing.com/ (DECLAWING: What You Need to Know)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...

A cat/kitten could get outside, lets face it stuff happens. No matter how careful or good natured you are, it happens this i'm sure you know. They cant defend themselves, and can't catch food to survive without them. Please rethink it. Also, good quality double sided tape never fails as a deterrent from furniture. A spraybottle doesnt hurt either.. :)|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	You don't give many details of why you are considering it.    If the kitten is scratching furniture, you can train them not to by making sure there are scratching posts and scratching pads nearby (rubbed down with a little catnip).      If the kitten is just trying to climb your leg or something while you are sitting down, well, you can keep his/her claws trimmed and this helps.  They won't do this forever, you know.  The kitty is still sort of like a baby, wanting attention.    Is the kitten very aggressive?  If it is a male, has he been fixed?      I once had a VERY aggressive male kitten.  Everyone told me he would definitely calm down and be much more agreeable after he was neutered.  NOT!!!!  It didn't phase him.  He was a total terror when trying to trim his claws.  I took him to the vet once and even she had to drug him to trim his claws.  I WISH, for that particular cat, I had had him declawed.  But I didn't and as time went by I resigned myself to having a cat with a nasty attitude and sharp claws.      So it really depends on the cat.  I now have 2 female kitties.  Very sweet.  No problems.  Yeah, they will scratch the furniture if I don't keep scratching posts around, but what else are they to do?  They have to shed their claws somehow and they do it by clawing whatever is convenient and feels good to them.  They are also compliant when it comes to me clipping their claws.|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	Having a cat declawed is cruel and selfish and can lead to the cat biting people. Imagine how it would feel to have the top third of each one of your fingers removed -- that's what declawing truly is --. If the kitten is scratching you furniture, how about you go and get some scratching posts? You can also talk to your vet about getting softpaws nail covers as a humane alternative. Declawing should only be an absolute last resort. Try giving alternative scratching surfaces, nail covers, and distractions from clawing people before considering the declaw.     Out of all the cats I have had in my life, the only one that had unresolvable behavior issues was the one who was declawed. All 4 of the cats that I have currently have their claws and they all know where they are allowed to scratch and they know better than to use their claws on people unless they feel threatened.     About cost, most vets will charge around the same amount for a declaw surgery as they will for a spay. This could end up being up to $300 depending on where you live and how greedy the vet is. And unlike sterilization, you can't find reduced cost clinics or discount coupons for a declaw procedure.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Yes it is VERY wrong of you.Declawing, which is really de-toeing is supposed to be a last resort operation for serious scratching behaviour in cats. Not to be done to little kittens and deprive them of their right to live their  life as a cat should. It is a very painful procedure, the most painful thing you can put a cat through, it's so painful that drugs are tested on cats being declawed.The intense pain lasts 2 days, even with painkillers, and then it takes a fortnight until the kitten can walk without it badly hurting. Declawed cats can have many problems, their natural defence taken away, most turn to biting, some have litter tray problems, some develop back problems as they can't walk as a cat should.Cats need their claws to groom, to walk, to play, well they need them to be a cat !  Declawing is banned in many countries because it is classed as animal abuse  and that's what it is ! Many vets won't do it now,they have too much self respect and care about cats, the ones who do it, many people are boycotting,would you trust your pet to a person who is trained to help animals, but agrees to mutilate them ? It is never right to cripple an animal. You can look up web sites showing horrible graphic pictures and reading true stories if you still aren't convinced.A cat bled to death, a cat lost both her back feet ..... Please don't ruin another cats life, there are too many  already living in misery and pain.To anyone who thinks it isn't wrong,have your fingers and toes amputated at the last joint and see how living life with important bits of you missing, feels.|`|E4ib2SeGaa	oh boy, are you going to regret this question!  Yes it is wrong of you for several reasons, the most important one being that it is mutilation of your kitten as it is not just the claws that get removed, though god knows that is cruel enough.  Paws need claws it is that straightforward. Compare it to cutting your toes off at the first joint and then trying to walk on grit or gravel and that will give you some idea of the pain you will be inflicting on your poor little kitty.  No doubt some people will say oh it does not hurt and they get used to it, and the settees don't get damaged anymore.  If you are planning on doing this to your kitten to save your settee or other furnishings, I beg you to please stop even thinking about it.  I am sure there will be various links posted to you to visit to get the full information on this operation, I cannot bear to tell you the full truth of it as it is so distressing.  Never mind the cost to you financially, just think of the cost to your pooor kitten.|`|G032Flc3aa	Wrong, cruel and selfish, WHY would you WANT to get a kitten declawed? Don't you know that kittens haven't yet learned how to control their claws? Would you maim a cat for life for having the claws that nature intended it to be born with and have use of for life?    What does cost come into it for? Are you wanting it done cheaply by a butcher?    Look at the sites people have already posted, look at the pictures and read this below, which I have permission to reprint:-  "I'm ashamed to admit that I had it done to a cat that I had. When I saw her poor, mangled little paws after the fact I vowed to never do that again. What was left of her digits was limp, useless skin that she had to walk on. It was horrible.  I lost her to leukemia about a year ago. Her short life was spent tottering around uncertainly on nubs where toes should have been. Please don't make the same mistake I made in regard to de-clawing".    and then tell me you WANT your kitten declawed.|`|3FOmoaUZaa	It would be a lot cheaper to get a few good scratching posts and a pair of nail clippers. U could probably get one of those cat trees, too.   Unless ur cat claws u in the face on a regular basis and behavioral therapy hasn't worked, then declawing is not for u.|`|R2aTEi9Kaa	It is beyond WRONG of you. Declawing is a full blown amputation of the cats toes down to the first knuckle.     It usually costs the cat, their toes, their ability to stretch their muscles, the pleasure they get from kneading, the ability to groom properly, the ability to climb, the ability to defend themselves from other animals, the ability to stand properly and their trust in humans.    It usually costs people, the love of a beautiful animal, the trust of a beautiful animal and the respect of most of the human population.    Declawing, or more accurately Detoeing is a cruel and barbaric procedure that mutilates innocent animals and anyone who has it done is heartless.    Please don't do it.|`|Net8og9Baa	No, it's not "wrong" of you, but it can be a very painful thing for the little kitten.  Why do you want to get her declawed?  If given proper areas to scrach, and keeping the claw tips trimmed, there should be no problem having a kitten with claws!    As for costs, they vary among veterinarians.  Your best bet is to call some in your area and see what they charge.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> It's awfully hurtful to get a kitten declawed    > Look, It's a cat's life, who know's when a kitty gotta scratch a flea bite or any other itchy things.    > Yes it is wrong of you.    > Getting a kitty declawed is a dumb idea and cruel at the same time    > Its like getting your thumb chopped off.    > Kitty's love to climb tree , let them.    > Why in the earth would you buy a kitten and get it declawed?    Im not being mean, these are the points you DON'T declaw its claws.|`|w7C363Ljaa	There are pros and cons to getting a cat declawed. I personally chose to get my cat declawed bacause she's extremely hyper and when she jumps on the couch she likes to sort of slide across it. She was starting to tear up all of my chairs and couch by doing this and it wasn't something a scratching post would help.     You're going to get a lot of opinions on this subject, by my advice to you is to do what you think is best. Don't worry about what other people say you "should" do and don't let yourself be pressured into anything.     As far as how much it will cost, it depends on the vet. I suggest you call around to find the best price with a good vet. Maybe ask friends who also have pets what vet they use.|`|huEWXxmLaa	The cost varies, it depends if you want your kitten's toes hacked off cheaply or pay more, but either way it's very wrong and very cruel.While doing research for a write up on this I've had loads of help on here from people who  know what a terrible thing it is to do to any cat.Some think laser declawing is better,OK there's not as much blood and the wounds heal quicker, but it's no less painful or crippling to a cat.     Please if you love your kitten,don't condemn him/her to life without the bits he/she was born with, and you know he/she was born with them because he/she needs them..|`|c4dny3nfaa	Your not serious are you man ?

cI19nesraa	I would wait until they are 5 & 6.  You don't need another baby in the house right now and that is what a pet is.  At their ages they could not play with a pet of any type without constant supervision.  When they are old enough go to a rescue shelter and choose a nice calm adult dog or cat and if that goes well then add another so they each have a fuzzy to love.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Kids that age will hurt animals. My niece got a kitten when she was 2 or 3 and it disappeared and weeks later they found its body in a plastic container where she had put it and it suffocated. Little kids just don't understand about death and how animals can be hurt. They have to be older to understand how to properly handle an animal. Also animals can bite and scratch and this will frighten the children. If you must get an animal, I suggest a dog since it can't be manhandled too badly by a little kid, or something that will stay in a cage such as a bird, where the kids can't get to it.|`|6G973YWvaa	go to pedigree.com. you can select a pet fits on your family.|`|6cEwF2Vraa	It really depends on the personality type of your children.

Maybe even a Dachshund. Good luck!|`|UKENIXvuaa	The right pet is the one who chooses your two kids. The pet that shows enthusiasm and interest in your kids, wagging its tail and showing its tongue in anticipation of your kids hug and affection is the right pet.   But, in my opinion, they are much too young, to care for a living pet.  I suggest that you wait until your kids are 6 or 7years old.  This is the age when they can show love and caring to any pet animal.  They wont tear at its ear, pull the legs or even bite the animal.|`|AA11560792	a kitten they can hold it and you can show them how to be gentle with it.. and show them how to pet it just they cant hold it all the time.. but you can get it some toys and show the children how to roll the ball too it and watch it play...  there so much fun and kids learn how to be nice too animals and respect them and the kitty will grow with the kids and  you all will love it together good luck on what ever pet you chose.... take them too the shelter they have so many homeless ones too chose ...and they will be able to pick the right one for them....aww its nice you wanna get the little ones a pet im sure you all will enjoy what ever you decide.....
1c6TmvrZaa	My mare has the same problem. She spooks when a piece of dirt moves on the ground. The only difference is that instead of bolting, she starts her own little broc rodeo wherever we are. She is only 4 so still in training so it is expected though. Anyway.  I am not sure if you ride English or Western, but really it does not matter for this. When something happens and you lose control of your horse, the most important thing is to stay in the saddle, which it sounds like you have that under control.   The next thing you need to worry about is how to stop. Dont worry about the horses or people around you because a horse will NEVER run into another horse. I guarentee it. That is not something to worry about whatsoever. When my mare takes off on me, I pull the right rein all the way into my hip. This pulls her head to the side so that she is nearly facing her own neck. It does not hurt them so dont fret about that. If a horses head is turned in a direction opposite of the way they want to go, they cannot continue in the direction they want to go and will most likely stop dead on. Make sure you are holding onto something whether it is the saddle or the horse's mane.   This sounds like it would be painful to the horse, but I promise you it is not. You can do it if the horse starts bucking or rearing as well. I hope this helps and I really hope that you can figure something out to work this out with your youngin. It works like a charm for me. OH, I almost forgot to mention. If you are pulling the horses head with force like this, you need to make sure that immediatly after they stop and you gain control again, you need to praise them and make sure you let them know that everything is alright and that you are not mad. If you dont they might get a little head shy and keep testing you. It is very important. Good luck!?|`|S9OxMcYLaa	My horse spooks all the time! We found out that she was in a trailer when a horse spooked and tried jumping out a window. That is the reasons she is all jump. One time she spooked and I was on, I came out with broken ribs and my eye sight was blurry when I got up. I have been on quiet a few horses that spooked. Most of them were easy to handle, some where hard as hell. My old horse spooked when I was  bareback. It just resulted in her rearing and bolting. But I stayed on for that.  Try turning bending him when he spooks or trying to turn his head in. I got told to do that at a horse expo thing a while back.|`|d3yaKoVwaa	well you can do the old western "turn in a sharp circle" stop. but that can damage you horse and if he is young i do not recommend that. To stop a horse you need to shut of their gates as all horses have gates in the direction they are traveling.ie  using leg to push a horse one way as you are shutting that gate on that side...Anyway to stop your horse you need to sit riiight back and very deep in the saddle so he can feel the pressure on his back..also exaggerate the pressure in your heals and pull on his mouth in the release method you were doing. hopefully that should help...also squeezing his wither somehow slows them down and calms them. hopefully these will work and be a better alternative to running him into walls    good luck!|`|qoL7LTIUaa	what you did sound like the right thing  a horses natueral instinct is to run and they should never be punished for that  you can always circle tiny ones but sometimes that doesn't work so what you did was fine  build a good ground relationship with hand walking and lots of grooming  make sure he gets out before you ride or you can longe him before you ride to makesure that he doesn't just want to get out and play  just work through everthing that he is scared of and in other situations have another horse lead yuo guys through a tough spot  good luck and by the time you have conquered a majority of these fears you will have a relationship 100X stronger  good luck, be patient, and look at things from your horses point of view|`|VrAWIEjVaa	hi!  i have a 18hh 5 year old horse TB that is absolutely freaked off other horses (horse shy) and everytime i had to take him into a squishy horse warm up arena i couldnt get him to do anything he would just shy and got to the point that he would get so freaked out he would rear. he tented to work himself up into quite a state.  i have now learnt to keep his mind off everything else but me by doing this i would straight away trot him into a warm up arena in a collecting but forward moving trot, then making him keep forward and using his hind quaters i get him to do nice tight circles in a figure of eight then moving him forward out of this i get him to slow his pace down and speed it up. and after a year i could walk him in a warm up arena on a nice loose rein without him getting shy.    hence my final advice to try keep ur horses mind off what ever his problem is and try to get him listening to u. make him work a little harder.   and if he does bolt on u release one rein pick up ur right rein (normally stronger hand) and pull the rein behind ur leg. this is called a one rein stop the horses head is getting pulled away from his center of gravity therefore he will come to a stop u must use both hands on the one rein and pull as hard as u can.  once the horse has stopped leave his head in the bent position till the horse seems more relaxed and calm. then lower the reins and walk on.  do not reward him for becoming relaxed. his reward is being allowed to walk on.  THE ONE THING U MUST NOT DO is become scared or frightened of the horse and by any means dismounting him and taking him back to the stall.  many people believe in horsemanship and often get mixed up with becoming a horses rubbing pole u must become the alpha leader just like horses in a paddock this does not mean bullying ur horse once u have established the alpha leader ur horse will have better respect for u and will trust ur instincts more than his own. eg. u telling him to run away, then him runnning away.    hope that helps|`|gbaw9wHWaa	Well there is no completely bomb proof horse thats for sure! Every horse has something that bothers them... even really experienced ones.. my mare spooks alot too but she never bolts when she spooks, she just jumps about 5 feet to the side and then she is also very overreeactive.. she wont get over the spook until the lesson in over so what i started doing is working to get her mind off what happened by having her flex her neck to the side, which relaxes most horses.|`|cLtzGveRaa	Absolutely do NOT pull their head sharply to the side.  They can continue forward like that and they can be pulled off balance and go down and you can both get hurt.  Turning the head, or turning him in a circle can help, but you also need to bump their hind end and with your foot to move the hindquarters... and you need to do it gently.    I have also heard something called a "cavalry stop"... pull one rein sharply back and one sharply up can work, but I've never tried it.    If your horse is spooky, you need to go back to the ground work stage... preferably with a good trainer.  You need to despook her and teach her that you are her safety.  Do this in a roundpen with a flag, ropes, tarps, balloons, umbrellas, bubbles, and anything else your mind can conceive.  Teach her to focus on you through it all.      Then, teach her a one rein stop... and both of you do it until it is second nature for both of you.  It may save both of your lives some day.|`|8bTder08aa	My Arab had minor spooky issues with things like purple iceplant flowers, beer cans on the trails, dressage markers that were moved from where he was used to them, and leaf blowers (among other things).  We had our issues over these kinds of things, but there were only two times that he spooked to a degree that was dangerous.  Both times involved dogs.    First time:  I was riding him on a trail that went along behind the back yards of a bunch of houses.  All of these houses had fences made either of cinderblock or wood, solid fences that you couldn't see through.  My horse was not thrilled with dogs that would come charging out and run along their fence, barking and throwing themselves against the fence, but he would tolerate it and we both knew which yards had dogs in them.  Well, this particular morning, we were heading back to the stable, which we could see from where we were, and the feed crew was already putting feed out for the horses.  My horse was getting a little antsy about that.      Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something big and black literally burst through a window screen in the house we were adjacent to.  I could see over the fence but my horse couldn't.  Anyway, I just had time to realize that somebody had gotten themselves a new dog-- the biggest darn Rottweiler I have ever seen--  when that dog slammed against the fence like a bomb going off, barking more like a roar than a bark.    My horse freaked out and took off.  I have never in my life gone that fast on a horse.  I had been riding with the reins long and there was no way I could reel him in.  He belted along the trail and I stayed with him until we had a right-angle turn to get back to the stable.  I came off there, and my horse kept going.  He went charging down the asphalt driveway of the stable and slipped on the asphalt, falling and skinning his knees.  We were lucky it was superficial.    Second time, a different dog broke through the fence and actually ran under my horse's belly.  My horse went straight up in the air about six feet-- no exaggeration-- and when he came down I'd lost both stirrups and was barely holding on to the reins.  He threw in a buck and I was gone, and he took off for the stable, which was a mile and a half away.  He had to cross two roads to get to the stable, and he managed to avoid cars and make it back.  I had walked about halfway back to the stable when the search party found me.|`|9IZ0CmxPaa	Those fast spooks are the hardest and most scary because you're not really prepared but all I can suggest, especially riding with others, is riding every step. If you were tight and focuses it probably wouldn't have been so bad because you'd feel him make a fast turn and you'd be able to bring him back before he started to gallop off.     I know that's hard.. one time my horse scooted really quick to the left and I went right to the right side of him and landed in the side but I wasn't concentrating.    Ride every step and you'll be so in control you'll be able to prevent that from becoming the escapade it had.    A horse a knew used to be terribly frightened of strollers and we put his hay in an old one we had and that cured him of it. My horse spooks randomly.. usually when he's up he's more prone to spooking at stuff he usually wouldn't. He doesn't like hearing things he can't see (when we're riding in an indoor and he here's creaking or noise outside)|`|TY6Geyjkaa	I would suggest some sort of a bit with leverage - just for safety for now.     I had a spooky mare. I learned a few tricks. Pulling the head to the side is good, but don't do it too fast. Also they can learn to run pretty straight even when their head is pulled around. When you pull the head around, keep it up. A horse can't buck when their head is up, so you keep the reins higher and their head higher.     If one direction doesn't work, pull them to the other side. The change in thinking seems to throw them off enough to regain control sometimes. If you are riding western, depending on the bit, you usually want one rein in each hand for control.     If you have a leverage bit you can gently slow him down to a trot, then do figure 8's until you wear him out a bit, to regain control. In fact, when he tuckers out, you don't want him to walk when he wants to. Keep him trotting until you let him walk. Also a horse can't buck from a trot, so that is a good gait to regain control.    Oh yeah - also try lunging him for 10-15 before your ride. If he really isn't spooking at anything in particular, this'll reduce his motivation to spook just for the heck of it. Is he getting bored with ring riding? Maybe you need to alter activities once in a while to keep his mind engaged.    My mare was an Arabian and was so spooky - especially when we went on trail rides alone. there was a lot of open road between us and the stables, so I learned how to handle it. Maybe not always gracefully, but I did learn how not to fall the vast majority of the time. Which reminds me of the last point that helped... wet saddle blankets (lotta riding and time) :-) good luck!|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	I am glad you are safe! That was a very lucky landing!    A harsher bit won't work- no horse should have to be over a snaffle (or other mild type bit) unless showing requires.        Anyways, to stop a spooking horse, you need to have a calm seat and a calm voice. It is also extremely hard to stop a horse when it is going in a straight line.        Instead of letting him run forward (and usually mindless) try turning him in a circle. He may still gallop, but he will loose speed if he has to circle instead. Keep up with what you are doing (half-halts, sitting deep,etc) but do it on a circle.        You mentioned he is young- as he gets older and trusts you more, his spooks will be less, or at least more controlled.            My draft mare is very spooky (she doesn't know she should be a draft). When she was younger, she would take off and gallop around for 10 minutes before even realizing that I was trying to stop her. Now that she is older and trusts me, she still spooks just as often, but now it is more of a start and a few canter strides, and she stops almost immediately, as long as I stay calm. If I jump because I wasn't paying attention when she spooked, she takes a lot longer to calm down.       Once the spook is done, relax, and go on with your riding like nothing happened, and ignore it. The less drama you attach to the spooks, the calmer they will be afterwards.|`|rsp33Aysaa	You could go for a one rein stop.    My 10 year old spooks ALL the time...she even spooks at things like a jump she's already taken, or the mounting block I used to get on her.  My four year old has only really spooked Once.  Moral of my story, they don't grow out of spooking with age.
YnCUyvK7aa	I wouldn't start treating your fish for just 1 dot, but it might be the start of an ich infection.  Because neons are sensitive to medicines or salt, I'd wait to see more spots to make a certain diagnosis.  But even ich has to start somewhere, and if there was a low number of parasites to start, you might only see 1-2 dots at first.    Here's a picture of what ich looks like on a neon so you can get an idea of the size of the spots.  http://z.about.com/d/freshaquarium/1/0/r...    And some information about treatment.  http://www.badmanstropicalfish.com/forum...|`|adPO2SVraa	my betta has that too, it never goes away, i dont think its fungus, i tried many medicines but it never works, finally after a month or more it faded away. But for a while it seemed as if it was chewing a hole in him but hes fine and healthy now|`|dKKgwzGraa	Possibly, but one dot isn't much to worry about. Look at the fish closely for the next few days. If he develops more spots, he's probably got ich and it can be treated with either a saltwater bath or, more preferably, Coppersafe. It will not only treat the disease but it will coat your aquarium to keep parasites out for up to a month. If he doesn't develop more spots, however, or if the spot goes away, then there's nothing to worry about.|`|3n60UxgQaa	Probably not.    Ich looks like grains of salt has been sprinkled over the body.  Thus, it affects the whole body.  You probably won't just see one spot if they've got ich.    It's probably fungus infection or something.  I'd get some medicine for that at the pet store.    Also, if your space allows, get 3 more tetras.  They're schooling fish and 3 isn't a school.  6 is, though. =]
NLAek2bJaa	I have a male and female ferret  and my big guy does not have much to see... I had to go look at him myself cause I have never really noticed if he had any or not!! Just get a vet or someone with experience to show you where they would be!|`|6cEwF2Vraa	He has testicles....|`|ErGQOhjqaa	OMG, you mean she's been cheating on him???  Sorry, couldn't resist.  I'll bet your boy ferret has stones, you just can't see 'em.  Next time you're at the vet, ask the tech to help you out.  By the way, baby ferrets are a bunch of fun.
3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	You need to give the same response as another cat would if they were being bitten too hard during play. First, go completely still (pulling away is our natural response but that tells a cat that we're still playing), then you should make a loud noise like hissing or yelling. If the kitten hasn't let go after that, then you can give him a soft tap in between the ears.    The only way that this gentle training will work is if you are consistent with it and you give him other toys to play with. Part of it could be that he's teething and wants something to chew on. Small, soft catnip toys are good for this. You can also find cat toys especially made for teething kittens at just about any pet store. Wool cat toys are also great.|`|8l52BsB1aa	Flick or pinch his nose when he bites and use toys as a barrier between him and your flesh while your playing with him.|`|8jb84t1raa	Hot Sauce.  ...or a witch doctor.|`|TRrTunqvaa	spray bottle with water. the kitten wont like being sprayed|`|rsp33Aysaa	I had a kitten just like that.  I didn't want to put anything with taste on my hands for punishment, because she loved to lick too.  She grew out of it (a little bit), I bet your guy will too.  But you could definetly try spraying him.  That's how we got my kitten to stop climbing up the Christmas tree.|`|YVOlCNmaaa	Tell him no. Flick him on the nose. That's what i do to my cat when it come to him trying to get to my food.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> Spray your kitten    > Say ' No ' in a little loud voice    > Use a reciept from a supermarket , rub it to your cat's back  ( but do not take it back ) . That will get your cat's attention to other things.
lyocWukKaa	Say someone gave it to you as a gift.  It is rude to refuse a gift.|`|Jguzosm2aa	You don't.    Because that's a very irresponsible thing to do and could very easily hurt everyone in the end, especially the pup.|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	Talk to your parents about it. It will do no good if you get a dog secretly, because eventually (when you get home) they'll find out. They most likely will be very upset and make you take it back to where ever you got it. This causes trouble for everyone who was involved, including the puppy. Just try to convince your parents and if they don't want one, then I guess wait until you move out. Sorry kid.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	You can't I would't sell a pup to a minor either. Not to mention if you did get him and your parents WOULD find out and make you get rid of him you have wasted your money,|`|TRrTunqvaa	thats not a good idea. im 17 also, but i would never bring a living thing into my house without my mother knowing. if she didnt approve, the dog wouldnt get the proper attention it needs. and if you parents are negligent of the puppy, who will take care of it when youre at school? puppies cant be left alone all day, and do you also have the money for the initial vey fees? and to spay or neuter the puppy soon? you need your parents involved, or you could unintentionally hurt the puppy.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Ask your parents. If they say no, then hey, only 1 year until you can move out! Dogs, especially puppies, are expensive and time consuming. First vet visit and shots is equally 50$+, then you go back in three weeks, another 50$, go back in three weeks, another 50$, then you get him fixed and that's about 100$. Plus you are in school still, so it is inevitable that your parents will have to help you with the puppy.    My dad always said no. He doesn't like dogs, he didn't want the responsibility of one. And it would of been unfair for me to push one on him. I turned 18 and I moved out and bought my first shepherd. He eats prime chicken and beef cuts, and I live off mac n cheese. He goes to regular vet check ups, and I haven't been to the doctors in a year. It's a huge sacrifice. It's like having a baby. When he was young, I couldn't go out with friends for long because he couldn't be left in his kennel for more then an hour or so.    If your parents are willing to help, congrats. If not, then you will be 18 soon enough|`|m5aqFpeEaa	talk to them nicely and try and slove the problem...if that doesn't work and you really want that dog then you should positively ask your parents! they won't mind|`|OJ0POy4Xaa	That's not a good idea at all. Your parents are in charge, and the breeder is being very responsible for not selling to a minor. You need to speak to your parents about this, but accept it if their answer is no. One of these days you will have your own place and can get any animals you want. You wouldn't want to get the puppy and then your parents make you get rid of it.   Be patient and hang in there! :)    I see your update and so I thought I would respond. Well bred dogs are expensive for a very good reason, and when you're an adult you will see that $800 isn't something only a lotto winner could afford. :) I used to breed Great Pyrenees and my puppies were $500 each, they were all reserved before they could leave their mother and nobody complained about the price. There is a reason expensive puppies are expensive---Genetic tests, titles, health guarantees, etc. You get what you pay for, and I would be so wary of a breeder willing to sell a $50 dog to a 12 y/o.   I still say the best policy is to be up front with your parents. I know how frustrating it is, when I was a kid I wanted a Rottweiler and my parents got me a Pug. lol And if you keep saving up your money until you're old enough to make your own pet choices, you'll have that $800!|`|Net8og9Baa	Don't.  That new pup needs to go to a proper home where EVERYONE is involved and accepting of his adoption.  The breeder is doing the right thing by not allowing you to buy the pup -- they know he could very well end up in a shelter that way.    Wait until you are old enough, on your own, and financially stable before you attempt to adopt a dog.|`|siE3TpgFaa	Naruta, it's clear you really want a dog, and I hope some day you do get one, and treat him well, and you'll find in him the best friend you'll ever have.   But puppies need to be loved and cared for with kindness and respect and patience by EVERYONE in your family. It sounds like your parents aren't into dogs. Why don't you try educating them a bit, give them stuff to read, or have them be around a friend's nice dog. It will be far nicer for both you and your dog if you have permission first. Sneaking will only lead to bad things for you and the puppy, and that is just not right.  Also, please do not buy a pup from a store. When you are able to get one, go to your local animal shelter and adopt a dog there.  Good luck, and be patient!

My dog would do the same thing if he got an opportunity. Now I give him toys made for tough chewers. Don't buy him anything that you can bend or squeeze because if you do, your dog will ingest it. I had that happen once and my dog threw up four times before he got the last of it out of his system. Hope this helps!|`|5Aej2zebaa	If you think it is coming from his toys, you should buy him the toys that come with no stuffing. www.drsfostersmith.com has some for sale.

gDx1hI7Eaa	Physiologically, humans can consume any food meant for dogs.  It is however, inadvisable.  Dog treats and food are of much poorer quality than human food, and they contain more "Crude" food elements.  Dogs are descended from carnivorous canines, and their food contains simulated crude (straight-up with little processing) fats and proteins that are harder to digest, as though they'd just eaten it off a kill.  Its clean and edible, just not "made for humans".    I'd recommend any of the flavored harder treats if you're really curious. The taste is kind of like a hard, stale biscuit or cookie.  (My own youthful experience was with the multi-colored milk bones).|`|2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	Why on earth do you want to eat dog treats?|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I would eat anything that my dog eats except for the horse manure that he rather fancies.

How about baby carrots?  They're not specifically "dog treats", but both humans and dogs seem to like them.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	This is a funny question but I'll give it a shot. Any treat your pet eats is safe for you to eat. And by the way beggin strips do not taste like bacon! There are recipes all over for home made dog treats and cakes that are made from basic home ingredients that are safe for people and pets alike. On the reverse, you dog can also enjoy frozen brussel sprouts as a treat that you can help yourself to. Remember, no grapes though.    **There is a treat out there that a client of mine had one time, they looked like vanilla cookies with the cream in the middle, made for dogs, but tasted like human cookies. MMMMM.|`|lsiyoSRaaa	Dog biscuit|`|1KfbgBupaa	My friend used to make dog treats because her little girl would eat them too.    Guess you could read the ingredients and find some that don't contain products you'd find objectionable to be in your diet.
MzHwklzKaa	If medicine doesn't work within 4 days, call the doctor.    That goes for animals and people.      I don't mean cured in 4 days, but there should be marked improvement.  You should be able to tell it's working.    I don't know what could be wrong, but I learned the hard way about meds.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	you need to consult the vet over the phone about the baytril not working. i have a lot of experience with baytril & respratory infections with my birds. my vet would give my bird a baytril shot to jump start the process. in general i gave the baytril over a 2-3 week time frame. it worked by 3-4 days into it. always complete all of it even if the rat looks better. always communicate and stay in touch with the vet about any concern about how a medication is or isn't working. call the vet first and see what they want you to do next. don't worry they can help you figure it out. 2 of my birds weigh 20grams and the rest are about 12-14grams so they are smaller than a rat....it may take a little longer before the antibiotic kicks in for your rat because of the size. it is a young rat so it may be the same weight....i don't know but weight plays a big part in this. i understand that birds are not the same as rats. but respratory infections and baytril is a common thing for small animals.     I would also send a letter of complaint to the pet shop & inform them they sold you a sick animal and that their other rats may be ill. Their rats need to be treated as well. Or you can call them and ball them out for the medical costs. I know what it's like I was sold a very sick bird they claimed was perfectly fine. We spent almost 800 bucks on her vet bills by the time she passed on. don't have to if you dont want to.    Best wishes....call your vet and ask for advice on what to do next. Take care.|`|UMfumO1paa	Baytril never works for my rats by itself. If it was going to help it should have already started working. Sounds like she is getting a secondary infection. This is what you need to do. Call your vet back and tell your vet that not only do you want her to stay on the baytril you also want her on Vibramycin. My girls take both of this together and it works like a charm. But call your vet soon. Secondary infections can wreak havic on there respitory systems. But I wont lie, Vibramycin is pretty pricey. I have to pay $40 for a bottle and I usually have to have 2 bottles. Of course I have 17 females and thats why. I once had a rat that got a respitory infection and they prescribed baytril. After 4 days she finally perked up then on the fifth day went right back down hill again and was worse. She was on her last legs. They gave me more baytril and some vibramycin and within 2 days her chest sounded alot better and she was runnning, eating and playing. But I really hope that I helped. I hate to see rats get sick, it just breaks my heart|`|Ty3ZSAXBaa	They should be getting treated for 7-10 days then get a check up|`|X1LlP5KPaa	I was going to e-mail you about this because it is not relevant to your post, but alas, you do not allow that and I feel it is too important to forget about so I have to post it on here.    When you rat gets better, please get it a friend and do a ton of research about rats.  Rats are miserable alone and need a rat companion.  Join goosemoose.com for any question or concerns you might have.  Read through all the pet rat sites you can.  They are very high maintenance and require a lot of attention and work to live happy and healthy lives.|`|C75EsUXRaa	Antibiotics have to be regular, mine are always prescribed 2mm twice a day at that dose they are usually much improved in 2/3 days I don't usually quarantine if already been in contact with other rats because if its spreadable its too late, I get extra baytril and treat everybody just in case,  not lost anyone yet upto now the baytril has worked, I think I would split the dose and give twice a day evenly apart like we have to when we are on antibiotics .BUT PLEASE NOTE. a side effect of baytril is that it retards growth in rats under 4 months old so I think you should have been given a steroid injection the 5 dayer and perhaps DOXY or AMOXY             go to another vet they got it wrong
1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	I have a female Shihtzu and we absolutely LOVE HER!!!  She is almost 3 years old and is absolutely no trouble.  Very loving and precious.  Wants love and attention all the time.  Perfectly content to just sit in your lap or sleep on your pillow where YOUR head is supposed to be.  Too funny!!!  A little timid around any other kind of animal though.  She thinks she's human.      She's never been bred before and as far as when she's in heat, I just put sheets (folded in half) on the couches and chairs in the living room (she has run of that part of the house during the day) and she doesn't mess up anything really.  I've only found one spot on a chair and it was very minimal.  She really keeps herself clean.    We  have 2-12 year old girls and a 7 year old girl, my husband, and myself in the house.  We take her everywhere with us.  We eat at my mother-in-laws on Sundays, and there are at least 12 of us there (ranging in age from 2 to 65) and she is great with everybody.    I highly suggest this little pup.  You won't regret it!!!  You'll wonder what you ever did without one.  ^_^|`|MzmDqZ26aa	No, they're ugly dogs.    Real answer:  Basically, most puppies will suit your needs, as long as you train them properly. Aggression, barking, and other problematic behaviors later on can easily be controlled by proper training in it's early life. The breed of dog plays a MUCH smaller role in its end behavior, when compared to the training it receives.    (If you want to go the cheap and humane way, pick up a mutt from the local pound. If it's young, it's trainable, and will be less likely to suffer from genetic disorders than purebreds.)|`|0zxiLWdcaa	I've had two shih tzus, and in my experience the female was way more dominant! But it sounds like you have plenty of people in your house to keep it company, they like A LOT of attention. And both male and female are super loving. I love shih tzus though, they are the best dog! Oh and you should definitely get your dog spayed/fixed, its worth it. I've heard if your female dog goes into heat other male dogs will go crazy trying to get to her.|`|Ae3c7a8Naa	I love my 2 Shih tzus and my friends love theirs equally as much.   Start training them early and you shouldn't have any problems.  One of mine was allowed to run wild as a pup and sometimes still will have accidents in the house. I love The Dog Whisperer,Cesar Milan. Not sure of the spelling. Be calm and assertive as pack leader. No shouting or hitting. Plenty of exercise with you in front with the leash. Good luck!!|`|qMhUhAALaa	Hi there! First let me say that typically Shih-tzu's are an excellent choice as a family pet! They are very sweet, kind and generous with love! If you are looking for a lap dog, you can't go wrong with these little doll babies! As a groomer I obviously dealt with lots of these little angels. They are easy in disposition, follow  the rules(lol), meaning very easy to train, they just love their owner(family). Sounds like the age groups that are in the household fulltime would not be a problem, however, the 4 year old that visits needs supervision when interacting with the Shih-Tzu, especially if you get a young pup! It is in my experience NOT the dogs fault when a child gets nipped that has not been taught how to handle a small breed. This is very important when having a young child handling a very small breed like these guys. As far as male versus female? Well I happen to have both male and female chihuahua's, the females are more dominant, the males are much more submissive. Actually it really depends on  the individual dog, but neutering/spaying takes away most dominant personalities in either male or female. I don't find in the Shih-Tzu's that either sex is a factor, they are just sweethearts. Unless you intend to breed or show, you should spay/neuter, this would alleviate "period" issues with the females, and territorial behavior with the male. Hope this helps! Enjoy your new pup!!|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes they are adorable if you don't want puppies get a male|`|q1Swxe3qaa	its not a period, shes in heat, just get her spayed.|`|xAoZdzGeaa	I have one, he is 7 years old. He doesn't like kids, he is very nippy(will bite if bothered) He is very spoiled,likes to play with his toys,but don't try to take it from him unless he wants to let you play along with him.(very possessive with his toys)   I would recommend this kind of dog For people without kids.    Needs to go to a Groomer,atleast every 3 months.
8xyB2Xxyaa	take to vet asap! Eye injuries can be very dangerous.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	No, do nothing else but get her to the vet ASAP you don't want him to loose his eye.|`|eojRjimXaa	I wouldn't do anything. It's the dogs body way of  reacting to it, trying to heal. If it gets worse and nasty, then I would indeed take him to the vet.|`|AA12130640	Take him to the vet asap the same thing happened to my dog but I didnit poke her eye. It just kept draining water and then pus stated to come after. We took her to the vet but it was too late they said it had to do something with her tear duct. She ended up losing her eye.|`|mcYohMOIaa	When you say "puss", what color? If it is a clear or white, it is most likely not an infection. However, if it is red, green or brown then it is most likely infected.    If this were my dog, I would call my vet to get free advice from someone that knows your dog. If it is infected, I would make an appointment. If it is clear or white, I would wait it out a day or two to see if it gets better or changes color.
gpJ3RHbyaa	lol you're so GIRLY, it's CUTE! :D      just play with her, feed her right, EXERCISE her and give her lots of care and attention. Reward her with praise for her good behavior.   ;)        To ?Mini  Alright CALM DOWN. geez.  It was a joke...that's why I have that ;) face in the end.  I thought he was cute for caring so much.  I have many guy friends who spoil their dogs and we all think they're girly too.  It's a cute trait that guys have. No negativity...  RELAX.|`|P6NptCz8aa	Take her for walks everyday. Give her treats. Give her love and affection when it is behaving.     You can only spoil a dog by giving them positive attention when they have done something wrong. So if she's not doing anything wrong - love the heck out of it.|`|AA12069383	I always thought training was a time for learning and playing. It's for you and the dog's benefit.  As for Inah, what's wrong with being girly? Are you implying only girls give their dogs love?|`|zWBYxMvWaa	First you need to earn her respect, if she respects you then the love will come right after.      Train her, punish her if she does something bad, reward her when she does something right, play with her, be the one to give her food.|`|eDySIDPQaa	Trick to lovnig a dog, you have to train, love, and patience on all things, pet her, talk to her, and most of all, you do have to spoil them a little bit.....    get in the floor and play with her, outside play time is so important it will make you closer to have more time together...the more you mess with her, the more she will know you really love her...all dogs needs lots of love...does not mean they won't train well for you...means you care, and you will have a lifetime friend and companion,    train, love, love and more love.....    laying in the floor with the dog beside you...that is love...not just at feeding time or just walk time..all the time...love is true love|`|7x9lvbhAaa	pet her every once in a while|`|Mrs4JG9taa	That MINI girl really need to calm down.     Girly is not bad. It's a way of telling guys that they have a sensitive side.  It's a nice thing.    To answer the ?, just pet your dog a lot, kiss her, hug her and train her.|`|LxUX3TdLaa	train her, teach her tricks, get her spayed and let her lounge on the couch.|`|C93lTJozaa	Spoiling her is a type of love !! just spoil her, she will love and spoil you back..|`|K7BjKJgoaa	By making her feel protected and comfortable around you. Pet her and talk to her, spend time with her, throw a ball for her, etc. but do scold her for bad behavior. The same way a mother or father would really. Your mother didn't encourage bad behavior in you did she? I hope not. ;)|`|DYxb7P3Baa	spend time with her, play with her. don't give her that many treats.|`|LGpv2grIaa	Training is the best investment you can make in your relationship with your dog. You'll need to do your homework first, though, to learn how to communicate what you want in a way that your dog will understand. Stay consistent and patient, reward your dog for getting it right and remember: you can train a dog of any age.|`|mbuB22D2aa	play with her
oqiH3fCCaa	rabbits are cute, or a moose.|`|FC5BxnoPaa	Ferret(s), rat(s), mice, guinea pig(s), gerbil(s), reptile(s) (lizards, turtles, etc), salamander(s), frog(s), caecilian(s), scorpion(s), tarantula(s).|`|NFUJAOtTaa	get a rabbit|`|NLAek2bJaa	I had the same issue living in an apartment. No cats or dogs, but I had three ferrets, two snakes and a savannah monitor so not sure how exotic you want to get! It depends on how much space you have, how much time you can devote in giving it attention and financially if you can feed it. Hamsters are nothing. It just depends on what you want. Try a small lizard in a smaller cage and they are not that expensive to feed such as crickets. But, they do need heat and certain temperatures and humidity so u need to decide on how far your willing to go with an exotic animal to take care of it! There are hermit crabs, snakes, snakes are very easy but you do need to know a few details on them, bunnies, turtles, maybe other reptiles. You just need to find a specific one first and do some research on how to take care of it. If you do decide on a certain one, post another question on how to take care of it and you will get answers.|`|pgdNUFt1aa	how about a snake? they make good pets|`|lGc2uTHXaa	How about moving to a complex that allows animals.     Spend your time figuring out a plan to make that work.|`|5D45Qbi2aa	LOL Mike; a moose      Buhh yerhh i agree with him  The rabbit part lols|`|44kEtDvIaa	Mandy pretty well said it all.  Do your research on these and you should come up with something that'll work for you.  Just make sure your complex doesn't ban anything more than just dogs and cats.
Nu6vDwLtaa	it isnt fair on the dog, but if the dog is not allowed to enter inside, and the guy may have been freezing and wanted a hot drink what is supposed to do with him?  the guy may have had no intention of stopping when he brought the dog out but it turned out that it was so cold he needed to warm up.    dont forget, dogs are animals that originally were wild and have fur coats to keep them warm.  i think though if the dogs were wild they would have huddled together for extra warmth.    but as humans have taken the role as leader of the pack, it is a responsibilty to keep the dog warm.    i see both sides of it.  but the guy may not have done out of cruelty, but more because the law says that dogs are not allowed in places that serve food and bevarages.    i also hate animal cruelty, but i think in this case no cruelty has been done on purpose.  sorry.  i would also feel bad for the dog, and if it was me i wouldve gone home.|`|ctiKoGGfaa	It depends on the breed of dog, some dogs thrive in cold weather.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I would have already gone over and said something smart **** to him, like "oh are you enjoying that nice hot coffee, if you don't want to be wearing it go out and get your dog out of the cold" But that is just me.|`|3giaPYe8aa	No, you are not over reacting...you are ranting.  Although, I agree with you, the dog could very well be stolen because of his decision.|`|AA10229248	I'd be more concerned with somebody coming along and stealing the dog.     There's nothing wrong with leaving a dog outside in inclement weather for a short period of time. Depending on the breed, that is. Probably not a good idea to do it with a chinese crested or a greyhound. But a lab or a husky? I don't see a problem.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	My primary concern would be dog theft, as anyone could have untied the dog & taken it.     The weather? For some breeds it would be a factor for others irrelevant.      I would never leave my Dobermanns tied up *anywhere*, not benched at a dog show or worse outside a shop, for that very reason.    My Dobermanns would soon be howling if left outside as they loath the rain.|`|c2c3a447ca6a35c94ffed12e17bf8913aa	I think you probably are over-reacting.  If a dog spends a significant amount of time in the cold- then his body acclimates.  The only reason most dogs need coats is because the owner always puts one on and it interferes with dog's normal coat and ability to deal with cold.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Yes your overreacting, its a dog, dog are pets, they will survive.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	10 buck says that if you go check only the dog fur is wet, the dogs skin is dry.  Got news for ya, I have never seen a rain drop or a snow flake kill a dog.|`|08aiOlKBaa	Statements like, "the dog wasn't even wearing a coat" are ... really weird. Dog's went thousands of years without wearing human clothing. They have coats of their own you know.    Im sure the dog survived.|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	no i agree with you as dogs feel the cold to and its not fair on them to leave them outside in such cold weather|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Depending upon what breed the dog was, the cold may not have affected the dog.  Even some "shorter" coated breeds, as GSD's have a double coat, with the outer coat being fairly water resistant.    I would be more upset by leaving the dog because of the chance of theft.  I would also have sat outside and enjoyed my coffee with the dog.|`|yAuLv2GPaa	While I can't help but agree with both of the first answers I must say that it's sheer negligence on the mans part to leave his dog tied outside alone in any weather.   Once he walks away from the dog anything could happen. The dog could be fearful of a well meaning stranger wanting to pet it and bite someone or break free and run into traffic.The dog could be stolen. The dog could be hurt by a passing car should it be on a long enough lead to get in the street.   We take our dogs about anywhere with us but if we cannot insure their safety and comfort while we're away from them long enough to get a bite to eat or run a quick errand then they stay home. We will not put our dogs in jeopardy for the sake of a cup of coffee or anything else for that matter. You would'nt leave your baby in a stroller outside alone while you ran into a store and you should'nt do it with your dog.|`|vPde97E2aa	Yep,you're WAY over-reacting!!!!|`|FORX7yfQaa	It all depends on how long he planned on spending inside starbucks.  If it was a quick stop and go then it is fine.. Dogs have coats of fur that can withstand cold for certain periods of time. If it really aggravates you a lot then ask him to tend to his dog.|`|plZFYzlZaa	nah...I'd be pretty pissed, too. A dog's body temperature due to it's size drops a lot faster than a humans, meaning it can freeze to death a lot quicker.     Unprotected, an average human can survive in the cold for about 3 hours.     A dog, even with it's fur, about an hour or less.|`|AA12083992	I agree with you 100% Besides the poor dog being wet and cold it only takes a few seconds to steal a dog left out like that. I don't know about in NYC but here in Chi town dog theft is high because scum uses stolen dogs to bait/train fighting dogs.   BTW, I also hate seeing dogs left in cars in warm/hot weather, even for "just a few minutes" Some people!|`|zZZnQuQJaa	That depends on what breed of dog it was...    It it was my 2 Aussies, they would be rolling around in the snow outside and wouldn't even look in the direction of the door until I called them back inside.|`|eojRjimXaa	What a douche. You're definately NOT over reacting. I would have told that guy what was up!!    BUT most dogs do, do well in that kind of weather.|`|N8vdMSDcaa	thats sad|`|y7XOKTFgaa	u aint over reacting. dogz 2 me aint no dogz or pets. there one of us too man..thats our son\bro watever u wanna call em lollzz dey apart of da family u kno? u kno wah sweetheart, pay sum1 off to steal his pet..maybe den he'll learn his lesson. i dun care what breed it is folks! das ur family member righ dere! how wud u like it if we left u in da cold tied to a meter poll lookin round wit does big eyez man...i get maaad emotional on dis ****, my pet got stolen once and i still aint find him! i learned my lesson.

I here so many dog saving stories all the time. Dogs rock and are truley gifts from god. I think its privilege to own a dog.

Neither could either of our 20 lb dogs. As far as them trying to, I'm not so sure. Baci doesn't know a stranger, Layla is too timid, and Buster...I think Buster has doggy ADHD.

My dad is even hesitant to come near the house with him barking...and my dad is not a small guy!

TdrgZwnoaa	They think that some kind (read stupid) hick farmer will take pity on the dog and adopt it so that the dog can live the rest of it`s life in the fresh country air. Here is how it works out in the `real world`.    BANG! .................. That`s the last sound 98% of these dogs hear. We don`t have access to animal shelters or animal control officers and the Police do not pick up stray dogs. They will offer to shoot them for us but they have more pressing duties so the job usually falls to us. It is truly amazing how quickly ```Rex```or ```Fluffy``` adapts to killing livestock to survive. As soon as they enter private property they are doomed. I live in a small country village and I know that if my dog runs that he WILL NOT be coming back. And we do not abandon our dogs as someone else suggested. That would be putting our neighbours and our own livestock at risk and we dumb hicks are more responsible than that.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yeah because people in the country never abandon their dogs.    It doesn't matter where they live there are irresponsible owners everywhere. they are also cheap because if you take your dog to the pound you have to pay.|`|AA12069383	My only answer for you is: people are simply heartless.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They like to think they are setting them free.  My grandparents owned a small farm outside a large metro area & had the same problem & this was over 20yr ago.  They & a neighbor would try to find homes for them, the ones that they could pick up.  Then of course there ended having a pack of wild dogs running loose thru the woods & acreage killing chickens & causing trouble sometimes.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	They have the notion in their heads that the dog will be disoriented and not find its way back home. Which is sad, sick, and disgusting. Fortunately...most people in my town know that I won't turn an animal down. So I've had 2 kittens and a dog dropped off here so far. I don't agree with it as I'm not equipped enough to handle more than a few animals. But I know what to do and have a dog myself. I still have one of the kittens...but I took the dog to the humane society and surrendered her. They didn't ask any questions suspecting me. I just explained the situation. Funny thing...I would have kept the dog...but it wanted to eat my cat!|`|bIaywrBCaa	Irresponsibility. We live way out in the country and people always drop dogs and cats out here. Cats can survive pretty well on their own. We have feral cats that come around, put feed out for them. The dogs usually end up at our house. We rescue all that we see or someone tells us about, then vet them and find them good homes.|`|lzmAVkuOaa	That would be stereotyping. Everyone does not do that. Its just the people who got the dog as a puppy and it got too big, or it developed behavioural issues and they no longer wanted it...|`|9UttDvcsaa	I think people in general think they are doing the animal a favor.  They don't want to take to the shelter not because they are skipping out on paying but they have this delusion that they animal will live a long happy life in the country with a kids and family on land being a family dog.  Or that we need cats becasue of mice in the barn! haha!  All my cats moved in and my dogs did too.  I guess the people who dumped animals on my street, steaked out my place first!  LOL!|`|7IVrBiT1aa	This has happened to be 28 times.. I am only 13 and in 13 years 28 times!  Its unbelieveable... I have had 9 puppy's and 19 cats dropped of out here... I just had to keep all of them though.. I mean I can't give anything away that people didn't want the first time and now no ones gonna want them a second time!? I mean thats harsh...|`|Q4UAJLgKaa	Because they can. They lack courage to take responsibility. They dump them thinking that you will do what they refuse to do.    Our off leash dogs one wintery December found a tiny black Lab  puppy in a 55 gal drum in one of the City Parks.  No one would have found the puppy if it hadn't been for the no-leash laws.    The puppy was scared to death, freezing cold. It had been 30 degrees overnight. It was snarling and snapping.     Can you imagine how afraid and miserable a baby would have to be to act like that?  The Police refused to touch it. We tilted the drum into the squad car's back seat. The puppy walked out, eventually warmed up and turned into a real sweetie.   I think the Police may have learned a thing or two about desperation.
YnCUyvK7aa	I use live plants for my bettas.  Their favorite seems to be plants with wider leaves so they can rest on them.  Their favorite to date seems to be banana plants if you have the lighting to keep them.  Some crypts [Cryptocoryne] need less light.  Java fern is another low light plant that works, but you can't plant it in the gravel, it needs to be tied to driftwood or rock.  You can do the same for Java moss so it doesn't float.  If what you have is Java moss, you could divide it so you have some to use at the bottom and leave the rest floating.  If it's like mine that I have in another tank, both parts will grow enough to make a decently sized area before too long.    ADDED You can buy crypts, banana plants, and Java fern at most pet stores.  Sometimes you can find Java moss there too, but fewer stores in my area carry it.|`|TYohMrlXaa	Defiantly get a kind of plant that he can rest on, they like to do that. Like something with broad leaves, maybe an amazon. If you want go for a fake plant get a silk one, so he doesn't tear his fins. How about a tunnel he could swim through?    If you want to add a little excitement to his day, try showing him a mirror. Not for very long though, just a couple min, let him chase the "other fish" away!|`|iWhWUqW4aa	Anachris is the best for a betta tank. No special requirments. It's used a lot in plain old betta bowls. You can also use those bamboo plants. Those 2 will live the longest with the least pollution.|`|b2UxTKueaa	I'd go for bamboo style plants because they tend to be semi-submersible meaning you'd have them both in and out of water which makes for a great effect. careful placement with a good looking substrate and the java moss you already have can make it look like a japanese forest in there, what's more aesthetically pleasing for a japanese warrior fish? :)    these plants tend to be undemanding in terms of CO2 and lighting too
YBcB0732aa	Cats can get reaction from their vaccinations.    "Mild reactions    The following reactions are fairly common, usually start within hours to several days after vaccination, and last no more than several days:    - discomfort at the site where the vaccine was given    - mild fever    - diminished appetite and activity    - sneezing at about four to seven days after administration of an intranasal vaccine    Development of a small, firm, non-painful swelling under the skin at the site where the vaccine was given. The swelling usually goes away after several weeks, but if you notice such a swelling, you should contact your veterinarian.    Serious reactions    These reactions occur very rarely:    - a serious and potentially life-threatening allergic reaction within several minutes to an hour after vaccination    - a kind of tumor called a sarcoma developing at the vaccine site several weeks, months, or even longer following vaccination    What should I do if I think my cat is experiencing a problem as a result of vaccination?    By all means, consult with your veterinarian. Even though vaccine-related disease is uncommon, the consequences can be serious. Your veterinarian is the individual most qualified to advise you if an untoward event does occur."|`|AA12340941	Its normal don't worry.  Being a older cat too it may have more of a effect on her.  If she doesn't start eating by tomorrow I would call the vet.|`|zADITYg9aa	My guys are usually a bit "off" for about a day after getting their shots (sometimes even running a slight fever). If she goes more than 24 hrs without eating, make sure you talk to the vet again.    I hope she's feeling better soon.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	It is completely normal for animals to experience appetite loss and lethargy after vaccinations.  It shouldn't last more than a couple of days and she should be back to her old self in no time.  If not, give your vet a call and see what she/he recommends.|`|tVG8PkCbaa	My kitten just got his Rabies vaccine yesterday. The vet told me to look for a few signs: complete loss of appetite, lethargy and isolation. My kitten went off and napped in a quiet room for several hours, but he still had a healthy appetite. Your cat may be feeling it a little more because she's older, but keep watching her. If you feel she is acting out of the ordinary (remember, cat's sleep for about 85% of the day on a good day) and continues to refuse food and water, then take her to the vet or the emergency vet if you can't get in to see your normal one. It's rare that something would happen to your cat after a rabies vaccine, but sometimes there are bad side effects.
YnCUyvK7aa	The fish are shipped in bags like how you bring them home from the pet store.  The bags are inside a styrofoam box for insulation, and a heat pack is added if needed.  Then the styrofoam box is put inside a cardboard box.    The company you buy them from will let you know when the fish will be delivered [usually the day before] so you can be home when they get there so they don't sit too long outside and you can bring them in the house and get them into a tank as soon as you can.|`|ZwjYKWrqaa	They usually only let you have priority plane shipping and you can choose from overnight or 2 day.|`|H06PtiIAaa	i did an unboxing video on youtube with my user name.    But the fishes are usually triple bagged wrapped in newspaper, in a stryofoam box with a heat pack, than that box is placed in a cardboard box for shipping.    Most companies do a very good job, again if you go to youtube and type bcaquatics you can see my video, including an unboxing from bluezooaquatics.
YnCUyvK7aa	The burrow in the substrate, so even though they have no intention of digging up plants, they will still do just that.    If you want to use plants in the tank, you could try Java fern or something you could tie to driftwood.  Or you could try planting them in a wide pot with larger pebbles on top that the loach can't dig into or between a couple of larger rocks that the loach can't fit between.    But if they're just in the substrate where the loach can reach the roots, you'll have floating plants.|`|c68XWGltaa	Dojo loaches dig up everything! They are very active and are constantly snooping around for a hidden snack lurking in the substrate.  If you have a sandy bottom you may be in trouble, if you have gravel you're probably fine.|`|dfb64b243bd35b4224dd85cc89895d3daa	Weather or "Dojo" Loaches have an elongated, eel-like body and five sets of barbels. They have poor eyesight, and use the barbels to navigate for food. If the barbels become damaged there is a high risk of starvation of this fish. For this reason a soft substrate, such as fine sand or soft edged rounded pebbles, should be provided as they are notorious diggers/burrowers.     Suggestion:  I also do not recommend having this fish in a tank with plants that require buried root systems, as they will dig them up all the time due to their burrowing habits. They will do better with plants that have free roots, e.g: Java fern, or other rhizome plants.     I  got it from http://www.aquahobby.com/gallery/e_dojo....  and I hope this help,     Good luck!
lyocWukKaa	You should show your dad this question and all the answers, he could be right and how so many could wrong.   I think having a contract would be a good idea also.|`|nzgZR6onaa	I am a parent and have heard it all before and after a certain amount of time my kids just got bored with their pets but I gave them a chance. You can always sign a written contract with your Dad that if you do not take care of the guinea pigs he has the right to give them away and you have to mean it.Also as for your sister the toy store has all kind of pets that make sounds you know the stuffed animals that are animated. This would be great for her and she would probably think hers is real too.|`|fZCfJWpOaa	It sounds to me like you're doing everything possible.  It may just take time for your father to come around.  I'd keep on showing him you're responsible and keep reminding him of it as well.    Guinea pigs are a great starter pet.  I worked in a pet store and would recommend them to parents looking to get their child their first pet.  Most parents ask for a hamster, but I always recommend guinea pigs because they're less likely to bite.  I can't count the number of times a hamster has bit me.  I've only had one guinea pig bite me, and it wan't their fault (a spoiled little kid was handling it bad and it bit me when I tried to get the animal away from the brat).  Another reason to keep your sister away from the guinea pig. :(  They're sweet animals, though very shy, and the perfect size for holding and petting.  The amount of care they need is fairly minimal--feeding, keeping the water bottle filled, providing fresh foods like orange slices and lettuce, and changing the litter out.  They are nocturnal so they'll make noise at night, but if they're in your room then it wouldn't bother your father (and you can slide their cage into the closet if their noise bothers you at night).  I'm sure you know all this already, with all the research you've been doing (another reason why you're responsible!). ^.^    You could also point out to your father that guinea pigs are a LOT less work than a dog and much easier to care for.    In terms of involving your sister with the guinea pigs, I'm not sure if there is a way.  You can enjoy looking at them in the cage together, let her hold a piece of lettuce through the bars so that they can eat it, but I would not let her hold one, even if she seems like she'll be okay with it.  Just because if the worst happens, I wouldn't want your sister or your guinea pig to get hurt.    P.S. If you adopt more than one, be careful on the sex.  It's easy to accidently mistake the sex of them and they breed like rabbits!|`|kK7k8zRraa	wow u seem really smart. the thing is, is ur birthday or some special event coming up that he would want it to be a surprise? If not, just stop bugging him (i dont know if your doing that, though)|`|mXEOcSeuaa	Wow!  It sounds like you're a very responsible girl!  Tell him that everyone on here says you're doing your very best and that you're ready for some piggies. =)|`|6qsfdMg1aa	Your Awesome!!!!    lol  I do the same with bunnies and my mom wont let me get one :(  no one understands!!    I don't know what to say to you just that keep doing what your doing you dad seems like he will give up soon. Yeah and just make sure you watch your sister if she goes into your room or really really really try to show her how to treat them. I don't know how autism childern are really.    Woot! I hope you get one and I hope you love it forever!     I dont think I was this smart at 11! lol
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi    She has wet tail.  Call the vet NOW and get her in there, in the meantime begin the rehydration steps below - hamsters will die of dehydration from wet tail faster than the wet tail itself.  DO NOT use the products from the pet store - you need a vet and you need one soon - the information I'm giving you is only to help her until she's at the vet's office - and seriously? They need to see her today if she's going to have a chance - I'm not trying to scare you - but wet tail kills if not treated.    1. Get a baby syringe or eyedropper.    2. Buy some pedialyte.  If you can't find that, grab some honey.    3. Mix the pedialyte 50/50 with water.  If you're using honey, add a tiny bit to the water until it's just sweet to the taste.    4. Drip this slowly into your hamster's mouth.  Don't force it or you could push the liquid into its lungs - very bad.    5. If the hamster responds to this - you'll need to do it every couple hours - you can move on to the next step.    6. Get some pea & ham baby food. It's best because it has 2 proteins, starch and some simple sugars.    7. Mix it with water until it's a thin consistency that you can draw easily into the dropper/syringe.     8. Again, drip this into the hamster's mouth, and don't force it.    The hamster may actually lick the water and/or food mixtures off the syringe/dropper.  This is good.    Remember - First call vet NOW - then start rehydrating her immediately!    Good luck    Daisy|`|uDQmkdouaa	she has wet tail! it can kill her within 48 hrs!

8xyB2Xxyaa	First, I would make sure she is on a good overall diet. A good brand of dog food, such as Wellness, Blue Buffalo, Eagle Pack, Merrick, just to name a few. They have higher omega 3 & 6 levels which help to keep the coat moisturized, and less shedding also. You can add salmon oil as well.   Also- use a good shampoo, like Earth-bath tea tree or aloe that will also help moisturize his skin.|`|3LAF3XCFaa	What type of food are you feeding, If it is from a grocery store it is probably the cause of the flaky skin. Salmon oil can help being added but eliminating the bad food and replacing it with a super premium food would be cheaper and more effective. You don't feed as much and you clean up less hair and pooh. Purina, Science Diet, Beneful etc. are not good foods. Go to your local pet store and see what they have. Evo, innova, blue buffalo, solid gold, fromm, wellness core, and orijen are my favorites. Then you don't have to supplement.|`|JsBb732Maa	Omega three supplements.|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Fish oil capsules, break them open and add to regular feeding.  Call your vets office for correct amounts for your dogs size and weight.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	put salmon oil on her food.  it is great!|`|s84kP2Fiaa	You can bathe your dog in oatmeal shampoo if she has 'oily' feeling skin. In the meantime, you can take her to your vet and see if he thinks she really need a supplement or any treatment at all. Once the vet tells you what he beleives she may lack in her diet, it will be easy to check online and see what herb or oils you may need to ad to her diet.|`|oNQeg4xWaa	take her to the vet she may have a skin allergy.i would have that checked out first and then get some recommendations from the vet.look under dogfoodanalysis.com and look for a quality brand of dog food that does not have any grains in it.could help a lot with her skin if it is a food allergy.use a oatmeal with aloe soap to bathe her with.hope this helps.|`|sdlvEMCjaa	I would give her a bath and use a shampoo for dandruff or what ever is needed. You don't have to use dog shampoo for your dog. And if you use your shampoo, it will make her smell good too. :-)
fNKGzPhzaa	Even Stevens?    + yes.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Definately, but doesn't mean it could whistle well.|`|AA11280073	Of course it could. It would be the perfect accompaniment to his tap dancing and playing Yankee Doodle on the drums.|`|naijqNojaa	i think so
Y5FyAekkaa	Wow, that is alot of questions!  Common antibiotics for dogs are penicillin, cephalexin, amoxicillin, etc and these are generally found in human pharmacies as well.  Anal gland abcesses are not always easily treated with just oral antibiotics though some require surgery. Here is my advice. Find either a vet who will do billing or post dated checks. Contact the local human society, they will sometimes help out with vet costs for owners. DO NOT GIVE YOUR ANTIBIOTICS. The doses can vary! If the vet wants to send home antibiotics ask for a script instead. Many times you can find them on the $4 generic list at walmart, walgreens, etc. If you do nothing else I say then atleast do the prescription thing! Regular pharmacies can and will fill pet prescriptions!!!! The mark up from you vet would amaze you. As far as cleaning him up, some will charge, most won't. Best bet? Muzzle him with a stocking and start clipping. Warm compresses should help ease the pain until you can get to a vet.|`|GVZsit7Qaa	Yes they can.. My vet gave us antibiotics when my dog had bordatella but told us if we have some at home you can use them as well. Our other vet told us to use antibiotics for our pet rats.|`|Net8og9Baa	OF COURSE you have to pay!  Take a shirt to the dry cleaners and ask them to remove a stain, then ask them if you have to pay... what are they going to tell you?  Veterinarians and technicians spend YEARS in school learning how to care for pets, and their time and energy is worth money, just like any other service!    As for the antibiotics:  NEVER give your pet any medications without the advice and consent of a veterinarian!  Irresponsibly and improperly medicating a dog can KILL him!|`|OJ0POy4Xaa	Have your vet or professional groomer teach you how to express the anal glands to prevent this in the future.   Technically yes the antibiotics are the same for dogs and humans, but different antibiotics are used for different problems. Some are for skin, some are for the respiratory system, some are broad spectrum---You need a diagnosis, and you need to know which antibiotic at which dose you need. Other than that, I've found a few websites that do sell canine antibiotics that can be bought online with no RX. When one of my Grreat Danes needed Cephalexin I was able to get what my vet would have charges $80 for, for $55. Not a huge huge difference but every little bit helps.|`|ChobLrxraa	are you sure its an abscessed anal gland??    it sounds more like he needs to have his glands expressed. which does not need medication. if hes licking his bottom alot and scooting on the floors thats probably the issue and it is a very messy and terribly disgusting procedure but it does not need medication.    ANYWAY. do not give you dog any medicine for humans unless your veterinarian specificaly tells you to. especially if its a chihuahua! the dose you give him could straight up send him into shock.|`|K7BjKJgoaa	Don't ever give your dog human medication without a vet's okay. The concentration is much higher in human meds, as we weigh more, especially compared with a Chihuahua!!    Your vet will need to diagnose what particular meds your little guy will need and then, if you can find it cheaper elsewhere, go for it. Have your vet show you how to express the anal glands so that this doesn't happen again.    And I can pretty much guarantee that you'll have to pay, as it is a professional service just like any other. Vets don't spend ten years in school to have people not pay for their services!|`|HR9mR2xtaa	Benadryl works very well with my dog.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	If the meds he needs have a human equivalent or the same, the vet can write or call a prescription into the pharmacy which will be cheaper. Try Wal-mart , K-mart etc. The Publix grocery we have here gives 8 basic antibiotics for free.  He needs a vet appt. - you can't just starting getting meds w/o knowing exactly what is wrong or the dosage.  It will be far smaller dose than ppl size.  It is very easy to overdose a dog esp. a small one.|`|t9Fxx75uaa	I wouldn't know what antibiotics would work since you don't really know if it is infected or just impacted which means that the glands just need expressing.  I know it's expensive...I just spent $192 the other day but you really need to know what the problem is in order to treat it correctly.  Now if it is impacted, while you are at the vets office, have them teach you how to do this yourself (it's disgusting but you can do it) and then you'll save money the next time it happens.    Why is your dog so aggressive toward you?  You better nip that in the butt too.  Dogs should NEVER be aggressive toward their owners....never!|`|AztYCjc7aa	Absolutely DO NOT give your antibiotics to your dog, it can be potentially deadly. Please take the poor thing to a vet to see what can be done, if the gland has ruptured he will probably be given something to flush out the gland and possibly control the pain if its just full then you can get a groomer to express them, though as a groomer after I express anal glands i HIGHLY recommend a bath as the dog will probably smell VERY rank afterwards, please do not have anyone express them until it is confirmed they are just full. I'm sure there is a low cost vet somewhere near you please do not let the poor thing suffer!|`|siE3TpgFaa	Antibiotics can be really tricky, and super dangerous. Even properly figuring out the math between what YOU take and what a tiny chihuahua would take is dangerous. But more than that, if you don't know which antibiotic to give, you could actually kill your dog. Antibiotics are NOT something to mess with.  Get him to the vet, and pay the vet in installments if you have to. Your dog is the most important friend, and he deserves proper medical care. Besides, you shouldn't have left-over antibiotics.

Unfortunately, there's not really anything you can do to train her to cover it.  It's never a good idea to interfere in their litter box routine, as this can lead to issues with them deciding not to use it.  The best advice I can offer is to scoop frequently to prevent odors.|`|MoONItFMaa	same way you train any animal FOOD|`|e5b4a22cbe6271d858c17e5d4b535dd7aa	It is going to be difficult for her to do that with only one front leg.

K8blUjQJaa	First is a caution:  Weight loss in cats has to be a slow and patient process.  Crash diets are dangerous for cats, as they can damage the cat's liver and lead to a life-threatening liver disease especially if the cat is quite overweight.  Look up the term "hepatic lipidosis in cats" for more information.  So take it easy and be patient.    Two things will help your cat lose weight: fewer calories, and more activity.    The fewer-calories can be as simple as feeding only at specific mealtimes instead of leaving food out all day and night (fresh water MUST be available at all times).  Put the food down for about an hour, let your cat eat at leisure for that hour-- then pull the bowl up until the next meal.  Adult cats and kittens over 9 months of age can eat twice a day.      Next, choose a reduced-calorie "light" food and gradually switch your cat over to it.  Be sure to choose good-quality food, not the "budget crap" you find at the big-box stores.  You may pay more per bag at first, but a more nutrient-dense food made with quality ingredients will be more satisfying and actually cost less per serving than junk food with less nutrition value.  Many cat foods have higher levels of fiber.  These are good to help your cat to deal with hairballs, and they also make your cat feel fuller after eating, and they help the GI tract.  Start with 1/4 of the new food and 3/4 old food for a few days, then 1/2 old to 1/2 new for a few days, then 3/4 new to 3/4 old for a few more days, then you can feed the new food exclusively.  Cut out any human treats or cat snacks.  If that's not possible, then BE sure to count those snacks in his daily calorie ration.  Just like that extra Coke or that second cookie you have at lunch, those treats add up.  Commonly, people trade food for physical attention.  When we ask the owners of overweight pets, "Why do you feed treats?" clients usually reply, "Because I love my pet."  Certainly that's true and we never want to tell people not to love or reward their pets, but we remind people that often the pet simply wants our attention and playtime.  I'm guilty of this as anyone.  Sometimes it's easier to hand our kids or our pets a cookie and send them off.  But it's really more fun to play with them while they amaze us with feats of physical prowess... even if it does take a few minutes out of our busy day.      When deciding how much to feed, look at the feeding instructions on the bag or can.  Feed the amount recommended for your cat's TARGET weight, not the current weight.  These are just starting points.  You may need to feed more or less to maintain that target weight, depending on your cat's metabolism, activity levels, etc.    Of course, activity will help the weight come off quicker and help increse your cat's overall body condition and muscle tone.  Sometimes, it's hard to get a cat to play.  Try different kinds of toys-- small crinkly balls that he can chase and bat about; feather wands; a long piece of leather thong tied to your ankle and allowed to trail behind you as you walk may encourage your cat to follow it around; a laser pointer is a blast for many cats (just keep the direct light away from your cat's eyes); even a crumpled up piece of paper can be a fun toy.      Thing is, many times toys get lost under the sofa or the bed and the cat blows it off.  Try tossing a few ping-pong balls or plastic Easter eggs into a dry shower stall with the door left open just enough to let the cat go in and out, and let the cat bat them about as if he's in a handball or raquetball court.  A lot of cats love the sounds and will spend lots of time swatting the toys about in the shower stall and the fun can last longer if the toys don't keep getting lost.    The length of the play sessions isn't that important as long as you play every day.  Not only will your cat's health benefit from daily play sessions, but you will improve "The Bond" that you share with your pet.  Even five minutes morning and evening will be beneficial.  Also, to a cat, your play sessions simulate a hunting session.  Try playing first, then offer his meal.  I'd bet that your cat plays hard, then eats, then soon goes to sleep.  This mimics a cat's natural way of doing things.  He hunts, he catches his meal, he eats it, then he's satisfied and goes to sleep.  Thus, you can try having the evening play/meal session shortly before YOU go to bed at night.  This might stop the nighttime begging and door banging.  He may continue for a while longer but if you know that he isn't hungry because you fed him, then grit your teeth and ignore it.  Sure, he'll get more insistent at first, but eventually he'll quit if the behavior doesn't get any reward (food or attention).    Hope that helps.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> What brand do you give your cat's food?    > Whiska's , Friskie's or Chef got a diet guide    > Play with her , like throw a ball and he will catch it , he'll run like the wind.    > Exercise him like put a collar something like a dogs thing when you usually run with them .

If you're feeding him dry food I recommend ditching it and going with wet food only.  It's much better for them and doesn't have all the carbs and unnecessary junk that most dry foods have.  The whole idea of special diet foods being necessary is pure bunk.  If you feed him a species appropriate diet in the amount recommended for his desired weight, he will lose weight.      Be sure to switch foods gradually.  Start by mixing 1/4 new food with 3/4 of his old food.  Gradually increase the amount of new food over the course of a week or two until you're up to all new food.  This will help to prevent stomach upset/diarrhea and food rejection that sometimes accompany a sudden change in diet.    Of course, you should have him vet checked if he hasn't been for awhile.  It's important to be sure he doesn't have a medical condition that's causing him to be overweight.  The vet will also be able to tell you what his ideal weight is so you'll be able to have an accurate idea as to how much to feed him.    The article linked below has tons of great information on cat nutrition.  It explains why a species appropriate wet food is the best thing to feed him.  There is also a section on commercial foods that lists several great foods that you could consider other than the two I've already mentioned.  It's a long article, but one that's well worth reading if you're interested in helping to assure his long term good health.  http://catinfo.org|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	Higher quality food (The higher the quality of the food he eats, the more nutritious it is and the less of it he'll need to feel satisfied).     Interactive play often. Plenty of toys for independent play, as well.    Feed the suggested amount for his ideal weight, and do not ''give in'' even if he tries everything to get more.

CdRlOsnyaa	you can get them from petco and online and stuff but befor purchasing one theres a couple things you should look for: is it swimming fine, try t get one with no big grey bltoches on its shell make sure it has clear eyes and that there not foggy , and if its swimming fine get one that looks evergetic|`|vS1Z0inOaa	You really do not want to skimp on buying a turtle. Probably the cheapest places you can get them is from stores like PetCo or online from places like Reptiles Unlimited or turtlesale.com. However, they will sell you wild-caught animals that are very sick and loaded with parasites and will cost you alot in vet bills later on even if they look OK at the time of purchase. If you're going to go with these, you might as well catch your own in somebody's backyard and the animal would likely be healthier--but that's really not a good idea either. It's far better to pay two or three times the money up front and buy the turtle healthy from a captive breeder. That's more dignified too, I mean, it's really not nice to take an animal that is used to roaming free and penning it up in a terrarium while animals that are raised that way are happier that way and wouldn't survive wild anyway... Another option would be to adopt one from a rescue. If you do that, you'll likely pay a moderate application fee and then shipping of the turtle to you, nothing more, and you will be doing a turtle a kindness...     What kind of turtle do you want exactly? You should know this before buying one. Even if you narrow it down to a land-dwelling turtle or tortoise, there is still quite a bit of variation in care and diet requirements across different species and you need to know that you will be able to provide for it.     One rescue in your area is the California Turtle and Tortoise Club (CTTC). They have local chapters all through California.  http://www.tortoise.org/cttcmemb.html  I can refer you to several other rescue/adoption organizations, and if you can specify what kind of turtle you want I may be able to help you locate a reputable captive breeder.

As they are not sexually dimorphic you'll have to get him/her DNA sexed to know for certain.  There are less painful ways than blood testing such as feather DNA sexing.  It's also less expensive (about $25 on avianbiotech.com).  I've used them before and they are pretty quick as well.

Some dogs have allergies to grass- that's actually common- and their instinct is to avoid it.     Also, Mel, it IS part of your job as a good friend to your dog to clean up every day. If you think you can get out of cleaning up your dog's poo by making him crap in the grass, that's not fair to the pup. The poo won't rot in the grass fast enough and it will still smell bad.     You get to flush the toilet every time you go, and it disappears. He doesn't have that choice. If properly caring for your dog is annoying to you, then maybe you should place him with somebody who likes dogs and doesn't mind this part of the friendship.
4aAhEK9daa	A pet quality Persian from a reputable breeder will cost you at LEAST $500.  Sure, you can find them cheaper in the paper from some backyard breeder but you do NOT want to buy from someone like that.  First of all, you'd be supporting the breeding of cats for profit - not to better the breed - and secondly you have a REALLY good chance of ending up with a PKD positive kitten.    PKD - Polycystic Kidney Disease is an early onset form of kidney disease that Persians are genetically predisposed for.  Reputable breeders test to see if kittens carry this gene and if they do - they don't breed them.  Bad breeders DON'T and then end up with litter upon litter of PKD positive kittens.  A cat with PKD can end up in renal failure as four years old.      Have you researched what it takes to own a Persian?  Do you know their coats can't be brushed?  They need to COMBED.  Brushes pull out and break top coat hairs and do little to remove the dead hairs of the undercoat.  A Persian's coat must be fully combed at least EVERY OTHER DAY ALL YEAR LONG to prevent matting.  With their flat faces a simple cat cold can easily turn into a full blown URI.  So special care needs to be given at the very sign of sniffles in a Persian.  Persian cat eyes tend to tear and the cat can end up with badly tearstained fur.  There are products to help deal with this but they're pricey.      Not that ANY cat should eat cheap cat food but especially not a Persian.  A poor diet will reflect in a dull, shedding, shabby coat.  A Persian MUST be fed a quality meat-based diet with little to no grain.  They also can have issues with picking up some shapes of food so you have to take that into account as well.    Because of their high maintenance Persians are one of the breeds most often dumped at shelters.  People buy them on a whim or because they think it'll impress others without a clue the care they require.  So you don't end up one of these people please buy a book and do LOTS of research on them before getting one.  And on that note, if you do have the time and finances to be able to care for one - adopt one from a shelter.  I can almost guarantee there's at least one Persian at a shelter near you.  And if you want to make sure the shelter Persian is PKD- it's a simple cheek swab DNA test that your vet can do for you.|`|URuzNGcyaa	there is no such thing as a "cheap" cat especially if your looking for a breed.

CKRfaRYvaa	Take him to the vet NOW.  Don't waste time on Yahoo! Answers when your pet is obviously ill.|`|AA11457471	Yep, that ain't good! Get him to the vet & avoid over the counter wormers in the future.   Stay away from OTC flea stuff, too.|`|4aAhEK9daa	Which is why you should have taken him to the vet instead of giving it dewormer from a store.  The dewormer sold at a lot of pet stores - and even worse - WalMart, aka, Hell, are VERY dangerous for cats.  They contain harsh pesticides. And how do you even know which type of worm your cat has?  Odds are the crap you gave him won't even kill them.    There's no emergency vets by you?  I find that hard to believe.  If there really isn't - and he survives the night - then get him to the vet AS SOON AS THEY OPEN tomorrow.  Hopefully they can save him.    Ironically the money you "saved" by not going to the vet for proper wormer probably isn't anywhere near the vet bills you might incur now trying to save your cat's life.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	What was the name of the wormer you used?    What was the ingredient? Was it piperazine? Piperazine can cause a bad stomach upset and even an obstruction as the worms die.I don't know why they still sell it.Next time,use a wormer with Pyrantel,unless it is for tapeworms,then you use praziquantel,which is very safe.You can even use a dog wormer,as long as the actuve ingredient is Pyrantel Pamoate.|`|6be65543422b4937c27d1761a2ed50a0aa	Are you sure you gave him worming medicine that was for CATS ???    If you weren't careful, you may have given him the WRONG kind of MEDS.  OTC worming MEDS sometimes make the situation worse.    PLEASE take him to the vet ASAP, and let the vet take care of his problem.  IF he's not eating / drinking, he could die!!    Hope you get him there in time.........Good luck.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> Where have you dewormed your cat?    > Go to the VETS now
VxKH7KHmaa	Absolutley not. The puppy must come from registered parents. Your puppy unfortunatley came from a puppymill and they certainly don't care about registration papers.....or anything else for that matter.    You'll be lucky even if in fact your pup is a purebred Basset Hound.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Nope sorry. Chances are, since he's from a pet store, one or both of his parents isn't registered. If you can get the breeder's name from the petstore you could contact them and check.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	Nope. You can't register a puppy unless its parents have been registered.  I'll let someone else tell you about the horrors of buying from a pet store. Should be any second now.
t78DA6Dpaa	Are you nuts! You got litter-mates! Good luck with that one.     Not sure if you know this but litter-mates are extremely difficult to raise together in the same household. They will only bond to each other or they won't bond at all and will continuously fight like mad dogs with each other constantly. They will be very difficult to train and handle. They will most likely have the pack mentality so they will never have full respect for you. They will never see you as the alpha pack leader. If i were you i return one to the breeder. Must have not been a very respectable breeder if they sold two dogs from the same litter. They're most likely a Back Yard Breeder who isn't educated enough about breeding dogs or homing them properly.     And the fact that you said one is nervous and the other isn't playing then there you go the puppies you just bought is from a typical back yard breeder that didn't do temperament testing on the parents. Just stuck a girl and a boy Lab together and they bred. So the poor temperaments were bred done to the offspring from the parents.|`|cR1M8ALyaa	If he's normally a playful dog, then he may be sick. You should get him to the vet just to make sure everything is okay. I have a lab myself, and he's normally playful.

Laxatone is good, a tiny little bit every few days and every day if your cat is trying to throw up an hairball.    I also mix up some of Purina Hairball Formula with her regular food. This works wonders because within the hour, I have something to clean up on the carpet!|`|GVZsit7Qaa	Petromault    you can get it at pet stores    its a gel substance that comes in a tube.You give it to them twice aday and reduces hairballs.

It works.|`|lgrzd9RWaa	walmart or purina cat chow go on their website and im sure they will have medicines|`|oYQBJGwTaa	Hi There!          I have 3 Maine Coon cats--one is 20 years old and the other two are one year old brothers. All of them are huge (over 20 pounds) and have ALOT of long, thick fur.  It's best to try to prevent them from coming (this is by doing step 1, 2, & 5 below).  If they already have a hairball and you have heard them trying to throw up or are struggling, then you can't "prevent" them, you have to "treat" them...The best thing I have found fro treating hairballs is step 3 or 4 below.  Here are the steps and products that have worked best for me:        1)  Brush them every other day (minimum) with the shedding comb.  This is a metal toothed comb and is avail at the pet store. The teeth are about 5 mm apart (Don't use the one where they are too close--it's for flea removal--).  The comb is better than brushes, I have found. They run about $5 to $9--the $5 one is just fine!          2) Make sure there is water available always & I even add about 2 tablespoons of water to their canned food every feeding & mash the food into it to make it thinner--this keeps them hydrated and, if they do have a hairball in their system, it helps them to be able to pass it.          3)  LAXATONE--malt flavor is the only one my cats will take...they like it,think it's a treat, and will take 1 teaspoon right off of my finger.  There is a less expensive one at Pet Smart or Pet Supplies Plus...my cats take it just as well (Malt Flavor--original).  You don't need to get the "expensive one."  One is $7 tube and the cheaper one is around $3.50 per tube.... Also,many people have trouble getting their cats to take it and give up...and then the hairballs come back....But if you go to them before they eat and they are away from their food area, they are interested and kind of see it as a "treat"--plus they have an empty tummy & will be more willing to take it.  If they are hesitant, gently bump your finger into their little nose/mouth area and they will lick it off---usually this gets them to take the rest as they realize that they like it. Mine will not touch the "fish/tuna flavor" only the "Malt."        4)  Last thing (for my older cat) is using a product called NutriCal by Tomlin ($9.79/tube)--this is just like the Laxatone or the generic grand, but it is more for when a cat needs extra nutrition/calories (like iwhen won't eat or sick or, like my cat, getting older and not as interested in eating)---if you give the Nutrical,it has the cod liver oil, too---so don't give the Laxatone, on top of that (and vice versa).  Cod liver oil is what keeps the bowel tract lubricated so that they can pass the haiball (without pain/trouble) in their bowel and not throw it up.         I'm so sorry for the very long answer, but it is kind of a mixture of these 3 or 4 things which gives me the best success with my three cats---by far, the combing is the most important if you can only do one.  However, nomatter how diligent you are, you can't completely get rid of them--every once in a while it will still happen, but MUCH less if you do these things as a routine!         Good luck to you and your kitties!  LIZ  PS---Sorry....There is a  5)-  There are also a couple of new dry foods that claim to make a difference with hairballs--some are more expensive than others and usually will say something like "Hairball Remedy"--I think they have the cod liver oil in the kernels of food---it really is the cod liver oil that is also in the Laxatone that makes them pass easily.  But, to prevent the hairballs, you need to brush them every other day--or everyday if you have time!  Hope this all helped!
AA11459417	When a cat needs to lose weight, it needs to be done VERY slowly.  Their livers can't handle sudden drastic changes in diet, or they'll get hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), which would require medical treatment.  So when you're trying to help your cat lose weight, you need to decrease the amount of food very gradually.  For example, if you usually feed one cup of food per day, decrease it to 7/8 cup per day for a week.  The next week, decrease it by another 1/8 cup, and so on, until you're feeding the right amound of food to maintain a healthy weight.  Also, by decreasing the amount of food very gradually, your cat won't really notice much difference.      You'll have to feed your cats separately if there's a problem with your overweight cat getting the other cat's food.  Keep them in separate rooms during their mealtime if you have to.      Also, exercise is a great way to help her lose weight.  I don't know how much you play with her now, but you might have to increase your play times and make sure she gets really active during playtime.  Toys and games that cause her to run are the best way to decrease her weight, keep her circulation going and give her a great time, too.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Hi   I hope you can convince your dad. The answer is simple. feed proper food for the species and she be able to regulate herself          Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> What food do you give your cat?    > If you feed Whiska's or Friskies or Chef , they give you a diet guide    > If you use other brands , i really recommend Whiska's , Chef  and Friskie if you want your cats not overweight.    >  Get her to play     > Put a collar and make her exercise ( like you do it with a dog ) ( running e.g )|`|TBZK5q78aa	I'm having the same problem... It's really hard to not feed them when they cry. Wish I could help...|`|uBFhKXgHaa	You need to be firm with her. And stop feeding dry food!    You're going to want to put your cat on a high quality wet/canned food. Wet food has far less carbohydrates in it than dry so it makes weight loss easier, plus it's healthier for cats anyway.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.    Make sure the food is a high quality one. A high quality cat food also won't have as many carbohydrates and grains in it.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.    You could even go entirely grain free. Diets high in grain/carbohydrates have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    If you're freefeeding... STOP. This is the fast lane to feline obesity. Read the feeding guidelines on your cat's food and feed accordingly. Adult cats are typically fed two meals a day.    Lastly, you want to keep your cat active. Get your cat engaged in games and playtime!      Darksong~
CdRlOsnyaa	if his stomache is caved in a little it might because of his gender. turtles sometimes dont eat when they first enter a new habitate, chweck the heat of your tank if its not warm enough some turtles try to go into hibernation so they try to sleep and not eat.|`|vS1Z0inOaa	First of all, please TURN THE HEAT DOWN! 85 degrees is waaay too warm for painteds, even babies. They are fine with 70 to 77 degrees water, and that's right about room temperature so you likely don't even need a heat source at all. You should have a heat lamp on the basking area though to keep it at 90 degrees.     If the one turtle's shell is really soft by comparison and his stomach is caved in, that's a sure sign of a calcium deficiency. He's likely not been eating anything for a long time and is getting sick because of it.     The biggest mistake you canmake in turtle keeping is to feed two turtles at the same time in the same tank. When you do that, one turtle will pig up all the best food and continue to grow quickly and stronger while the other one can't get as much, or any, of it and continues to grow slower and weaker. Many times the weaker turtle will eventually give up even trying to eat. The best thing to do in this case is to feed them separately in a separate bowl. You may want to set the two bowls next to each other so the sick one can hear the other one eating and hopefully that will influence him to get going sooner.     Another common mistake is to feed baby turtles "adult" sized pellet food and it's too big for them so they can't bite it. Some turtles adapt and learn that the pellets will soak up water and get soft; others give up trying. I always recommend that babies be fed ZooMed food, hatchling formula, because those pelets are tiny. But since yours is bad already and needs to eat NOW, try crushing up the food yu have for him now and see if that works. Still get the ZooMed baby food as this formula more closely matches a baby turtle's needs. Other good choices would be crushed up ReptoMin sticks and cichlid food. The cichlid food seems to have an especially potent, irresistible smell to turtles in the water and seems to get them eating quicker than anything else.     You're going to need to supplement his food with calcium. You can put a cuttlebone into the tank (take the hard backing off and float it in the water) and he'll likely chew on it. If you can get one of those calcium blocks you drop into the water that slowly release calcium into the water that would be good also.     Once he's eating, you really need to feed him whole food. Turtles get most of their nutrition from fish bones and liver, and since this one starved a bit he especially needs that now. Offer him feeder minnows, gutloaded crickets, and earthworms.     It's normal for the babies to not eat for a few days when they're shipped. They come out of the box all frightened... However, this one poor little guy is sick and needs to eat NOW, so do your best to tempt him. Some of them stick around like that for a long time; others only live a few days.|`|ld2vmypNaa	he sounds hinda  sick , and all babies under 2" have soft shells.  These guys come freaked out when they are shipped. Stressed out big time and may not eat for awhile..turn the heat down to 83.      http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...    These guys come freaked out when they are shipped. Stressed and may not eat for awhile..turn the heat down to 83.    May I give some advice?    Aquatic Turtles are a life long commitment.    Remember 10 gallons for every inch of turtle..   ***You need a heater...set at 80 degrees. If water is cold they will stop eating!   Sliders, westerns, cooters , midland, painted, map, yellow bellied all are basically the same and require the same basic care.   They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish (or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies) at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.  **** If these are hatchlings a 1 1/2  they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish cant out run the baby turtle.  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes.     Plus I also feed dried cubed blood worms or tubiflex worms or pellets at least 5 times a week for my five..  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms.  As they get older they can have  snails, crickets, flies, crayfish, small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them) any other leafy greens will do for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples, remember cut up in small pieces..  .  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take. And in the winter their appetites slow down some.  TOSS in a bird cuttle bone in the water for calcium that will promote better shell growth, it will dissolve real slow and if they eat it thats fine!!    Did you know that they need to bask under a reptile light UVA/UVB for up to 8 hrs a day for the vitamin D that they need to grow.   So they need a turtle basking dock.   Gravel larger than they can swallow, allot larger.  Their water needs to be clean otherwise they get sick easily from dirty water cause they poop allot.   You need a GREAT filter system depending on the tank When my girls were 60 gal tank  I used two double sided marine or penguin filtersIt really helped keep it cleaner!     They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle..   ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.    Size for basic aquatic turtle is approx Body length: 5-8" is average for males, up to 12 inches max for females, but average is about 9 to 10 in captivity. Life span: 15-25+ years plus. Males have the longer front nails and are used in mating. And are considered mature at about 5 yrs old. You cant start sexing till about 3 across. Real mating happens in May through June and hatchlings within 90 days. Eggs are laid in soil. If laid in water they will die. Do not cut the males nails!!  They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes, foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans.    ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell.   Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin, treat by adding a 1/4 of a cup of aquarium salt per 5 gallons to irritate and hopefully kill fungus. The addition of sulfa drugs such as those sold at pet stores under the name "Dr. Turtle".    Contact rescues sitesand vets  Red-Eared Slider: http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html

You probably already know why they are fighting. Because large guinea pigs, and baby ones, don't really match. Though it quite depends on the attitude of the animals. What you can do.

I would normally recommend putting two in a bath, (buddybath) Though I dont think it will work with your older one and baby.     I tried it with two , one was a bit older, about a couple of months (2) and one tried to drown the other. Though the water was to shallow.     Don't forget to give them all the same attention, as you used to.     Goood luck.|`|GVZsit7Qaa	You should isolate the small one till its about the same size.other wise theyre not going to stop fighting really.  It usually is harmless, but keep an eye out for sores. Just let them run around outside of the cage a little while each day|`|tc5A0vKDaa	Try giving them a bath to give them all the same scent.  Start with the baby, and then the two "Beta"s and then the dominant piggies.  This way no one will have a distinct scent and they might get along better.      It's the only thing I can think of other than waiting for the baby to grow, and even then they may not take to little snickers. I'm sure you know how to bathe a guinea pig (as you are not new to animals).    good luck!|`|SeWffWCHaa	i agree with 'Mord-Sith Megami' give them all a bath to get the same scent and clean ALL their cages out too to get away the smells or take her away with 'snickers' in your room if they get along then they wont be lonely why do you have so many guinea pigs anyway
DGqwqemHaa	yes the alive babies gonna be alright don't worry  the dead one's seems they didn't develop Normal  ( it's normal to have dead fish's and alive one's)|`|ZQfGvUgMaa	You have to separate the babies from the mom and all other fish in the tank or they will eat them.|`|vs8xxWEnaa	the dead ones will hatch in 2 weeks and the live ones will probably die|`|uzcK1k9faa	ALL OF THEM ARE GONNA DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA     AND THE MOM|`|xdLfEfp9aa	yeah the babies are going to be all right but if they are smart cause the mama guppy is going to eat her babies if she could and if they can the babies will hide and live until adults.
gUsJlTvKaa	It sounds like he has a Fungus. What i would do is:    1.  Water change of half the tank water and replace with betta water conditioner.  2. Put a product called Betta Fix in there ( or another product, ask your local pet store about this )  3. Add Aquarium salt to the water. This is a good idea to have in at all times but when your fish is sick its a good idea to double or triple the dose of salt.  4. Dont feed your Betta for a few days.  5. Keep the heat up in the water.  6. Make sure hes not in a stressfull area, but still is getting sun light.    Hope this helps.|`|t9zkYE3baa	go to here http://www.bettatalk.com/betta_diseases....
ENaEvmNmaa	Put her on a tether leash.One end is attached ed to you,like a belt loop,the other to the pup.When she shows any sign of getting ready to "go" get her outside.  You can go about your daily routine uninterrupted,the pup will just have to go with you.|`|AA12128656	"Now she has gotten so used to using the bathroom in the house when we aren't watching"    this is your problem.  if this pup is in the house, out of its crate, you need to be watching it DIRECTLY.    develop a schedule and take her out often, every 1-1.5 hours. do not allow her the opportunity to mess on the floor. do not let her out of your sight. this is a habit, and if you let it continue, then it will NEVER STOP. if you nip it in the bud now, she'll be housebroken in no time.|`|be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	Take her outside on leash to an area away from the door. Give her 5 minutes. If she hasn't urinated, bring her in and put her in her crate or, better yet, keep her leashed to you. Take her out again in 15 - 20 minutes or when you notice that she wants to pee (whining, trying to get away from you, sniffing the floor intently, etc.). Continue doing this until she pees outside. When she does - tons of praise and a couple of little treats. Stay outside for a few more minutes to see if she needs to defecate, too.     (If she has another accident, you might want to save the paper towel you use for clean up [store it in a plastic bag] and place that outside on the next trip for her to sniff it and get a hint at what to do.)    Anytime you aren't able to supervise her she should be confined to a crate or small area (powder room, X-pen, etc.).|`|5Aej2zebaa	Put her on a leash so she can't return to the house and stand with her outside until she goes. Don't give up, just wait and praise her when she eliminates outside.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	You need to confine her when you aren't watching her, crates are great for that.  She is still a baby and you can expect accidents. Its up to you and your persistence, keeping everything on  set times|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Put her on a leash, go out with her, STAY out with her until she does what she is supposed to, and only then, praise her and bring her back in the house.|`|6wSmZrrsaa	You are not taking her out long enough, if you truly want to get her to go, you may have to stay out for a few hours. It's worth it if you think about it. Also try giving her a lot of water before you are about to take her out for an hour or so|`|knId22OGaa	Get rid of it. Get a dog that doesn't attack everything.|`|q1Swxe3qaa	put her on a leash when you take her out so she can run up the steps. When she is inside, take her outside every half hour. When she goes potty outside praise her and give her a treat.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	11 weeks is still pretty young; too young to expect perfection.    Use a crate when you can't supervise or tie her to you with a leash so never lose sight of her.  And clean the soiled spots with a good pet cleaner.  The one I like is Urine-off, which you can get from vets and online.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Take her out on a leash instead of letting her out the door.  She is still really young to be house broken completely, so have some patience.|`|3K2H4zB4aa	take her out on a leash and use a crate during the day... shes young yet.. and I know from expierence that pit bulls WANT to please so she will get it.. It didnt take long for either of mine to be house trained.|`|26PPwzrWaa	She has too much freedom in the house, which means she is going inside if she wont go outside.     I would limit her to a couple rooms and only rooms you are in. Tether her to you when she is in the house so she cant get around the corner and go without you seeing.     If she starts to go with you standing there, say NO and take her outside imediately.     You need to take her outside on a lead and use a key word for her to go. I use the word potty. When she goes, praise and give her treats.     If she doesnt go with ten min., take her back inside, tether her to you, and take her back out in ten to 15 min. Continue until she goes outside.     An 11 week old puppy should be taken out min every 30 min and before and after the puppy drinks/eats.
K5HsBuBgaa	First use training pads then start the crate training process. Watch It's me or the dog on animal planet.|`|B7fQ6dUtaa	Dang|`|pvgwJwxvaa	this pup is obviously not fully housetrained and needs to be on a schedule and closely supervised at all times whether at home or at a friends house.
RPTwjyjIaa	The fact that they had water during the day and was only going to be out at night helps. Here I have had to switch to buckets instead of their water troughs because the water troughs are to frozen and I have no way to get electricity out there for a tank heater. During the day they are ok but sometimes at night they get frozen solid. We just fill them up in the morning and my horses are fine. It is not even like they are dehydrated from not having water and rush to the bucket when we fill it up either. Most of the time they do not even come over for a drink at all. Horses drink less when it is cold so at night they tend to drink even less if at all. Just make sure they get water tomorrow morning and they will be fine. You are a good horse owner for caring. Good Luck.|`|RloOJ43haa	You should never EVER leave your horse without drinking water. If the pipes are frozen then take some large containers of water from your house. Trash cans often work.|`|hZ8NUU1Raa	:O get someone down their if the girl that live near can get a kettle from her house or something then that would be good :)  or ask the local farmer to sort this out they should be equipped for bad weather conditions  Poor horses i feel your pain i would be going mental if that was me.   good luck with solving this  xxxxx|`|o1KWtGzLaa	If it's one day the poor guys should make it, but as soon as you can reach them do. They can last for an average of 3 days any without water all together so they'll be fine for now, don't worry. For the record it's not illegal about thier conditions either if they have shelter and food and your horses had water, your usually meant to give them acess to it 24-7 legally but it should still be there. The RSPCA will let this pass if they find out too, they'll know you got someone to help and you couldn't make it to them due to weatrher conditions. They'll survive don't worry. Bet you're eager to rush to them when you can, I know that feeling.|`|7b6fsMFdaa	Horses need water to survey they will want water more than feed that's just how they are, but i think they will be all wright in till in the morning as long as you give them water in the morning. If my horses stays in the barn all day i usual don't let them out at night to give them water they usual don't want any, but they get water that afternoon. For coping with out water i say they could go for a while with out it, but i wouldn't let them if it was me i would find some way to get water to them.|`|AA11570905	Horses should not be without water all day and then all night especially if they are eating hay - think colic.  I would be hauling water to them in buckets and jugs from the house tap if I were you (I've done it).  It is not acceptable that horses don't have water, yet you are comfortable in your house.  Sometimes it is just a little harder to take care of them properly but that is no excuse for not doing it.|`|2f2c6f10c5560ebd511a3a0f309b0f01aa	My concern would be the possibility of colic occuring in the absense of an adequate supply of fresh water.  Horses tend to drink less in the winter as it is.  No matter what kind of hassle it may impose, it is worth doing whatever it takes to see that the horses are watered.      The same thing has happened to me many times and I automatically start filling buckets with warm water from the house and haul them out to the stables.  It's not my favorite task in the world.  :-)     A well-planned stall will have a hook attached for a water bucket.  You may want to keep in mind getting some heated buckets and placing them in the stalls in cases like this.  I keep several heated back-up buckets on hand in my tack room for a back-up.  As a side-note, I also put about a tablespoon of salt into my horses' evening grain in cold weather to encourage their daily water intake.      Bottom-line, to answer your question, your horses will most likely be okay, but it's never a good idea to leave them without a source of water, mainly due to the possibility of colic.  Hope this helps.|`|L2rivPUWaa	I'm sure they will manage ok. Things like this happen, it's nature. We all know all animals should never be left without water, but things happen that are out of our control. I hope the farmer helps you out, and the pipes unblock asap          http://www.horserides.org|`|ZB0VuKh8aa	Well, in the wild horses sometimes have to travel for miles to find water, so don't panic.  They will be OK for 12 hours. This is not ideal but there is no need for people to get hysterical about it for heaven's sake!  Also, there is snow.  They will eat the snow if they get that thirsty.  Just get water to them as soon as you can.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	I sympathise, but water must be available 24/7.  In summer and winter.  Perhaps the farmer would be good enough to keep on checking the water situation and smashing ice,    One way we used to keep the water unfrozen was to put a bit of salt in it or, get an old rubber tyre, place hot water bottles at the bottom, and around the sides and place your bucket of water inside the tyre.  Tho the hot water bottles will eventually get cold, you can rest assured it will be just warm enough to keep the ice from freezing on it long enough for the next one.    Just one point.  Horses do not know to eat slowly and eke the hay out.  They will just carry on eating it until it is gone.  So what might seem like plenty of hay is not, in a horse's eyes.  And of course they need to drink to wash it down.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Water is MUCH more important than feed!  Even a few hours without water, particularly if it's very hot or very cold, if a horse is eating hay, can be too much. Without enough moisture, the horse simply can't digest the hay. That's when you run into impaction colics. Cold weather sort of sucks the moisture out of everything, and horses will often drink MORE water when it's cold than when it's warmer.    If the horses are on grass, they will get some moisture from the grass itself, and it's less likely they will get an impaction colic.    But if they are on hay, water is essential.  It's a big risk to let them go without.    Get one of those heaters you can drop in a bucket, or just a plug in tea kettle if your barn has power.  You can use them to melt snow, or to heat a bit of water to pour over the tap to unfreeze it(if it's just the tap frozen and not the pipes).      If there is no power, or if everything is just frozen and you don't have snow to melt, you are going to need to put a barrel of water in your car and get it to them. In a pinch, I've put a garbage barrel with a top, or with a plastic garbage bag with string tied around it to keep it on, to haul water to horses.|`|uWh6jAWuaa	Boil a kettle and get up there asap to unfreeze either the taps or give them some water!    Also boost their water intake in the winter months with some watery beat or warm water stirred into their mix/chaff|`|j45Q2ipRaa	It is a big NO, especially since they have food.  They can do longer without the feed than they can without the water.    I have the same issue in our barn.  Make sure you have jugs that you can get the water to the horses.  It may seem strange, but they actually go through as much if not more water in the winter.  In the warmer months they can get liquid from the fresh grass.  Hay is dry and needs the moisture to move.    If they don't have the proper water available, the can colic, get impacted and a lot of other health issues.  It takes a lot of water per horse per day to keep their bodies functioning properly (10 gallons and up depending on the horse).|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Let's hope so.  It is never okay for  horses to be without water for that length of time, especially when they are eating.  The risk of colic from impacted food escalates tremendously.  It takes a great deal of water to support the chemical reactions involved in digestion, and horses produce huge volumes of saliva when they eat.  All of this requires intake of water, or dehydration can set in fast.  Because they are stabled, they can't even eat the snow to support hydration.  They can do without food much better than without water, so I would plan to find a way to get plenty of it to them asap.  For the future, an emergency plan for such events should be put into place.  In the meantime, hopefully they will be okay until someone gets water to them.|`|vow5ULxTaa	you need to start filling up large jugs of warm water and haulign it out to the barn.  Horse need acess to fresh water at all times and should at max go only a day without water.  Horse can go for longer but it will cause internal damage and longterm damage to the horse.|`|4KY26xQqaa	Hi! I'd have to say no too sorry, even if you pop down to the local supermarket, tesco, asda, aldi or walmart where ever you live and get a a couple of bottles of water for about 0.70p each. And give them each a bottle of water tonight. Or alternativly you could get some of the clean snow and put it in a couple of bucket and it will melt in the stable. At least then they will have something!    Good Luck! I reckon they could cope a couple of days but wouldn't risk it.
MNLbVQ2kaa	Guppies are pregnant for 4 to 8 weeks. Put lots of hiding places for the babies in the smaller tank. Live plants are the best, but plastic is okay. The mother will eat the babies after they are born. No loving maternal instincts in these fish! Leave the babies in the smaller tank until they get big enough not to be eaten by the other fish.   Guppies can have 20 to 40 babies. The older the mother is, the more babies she has. If you don't have room for all the babies, donate them to the local fish store.|`|DGqwqemHaa	A lot can depend on the water temp & conditions, stress, etc.  Guppy pregnant time is always from 28 days up to to 30 days (can come early, from the day 21 up to 40 days)   i think u will have from 20 to 30 fry can be less or more, that really depends on the fish old, but the number's of fry's will increase in the next birth for sure,  they can have up to 200 fry..
lzmAVkuOaa	are we talking aquatic frog or semi-aquatic frog?|`|NzSA6dmyaa	depends on what kinda frog you have this is probably why people have been saying different things like a horned frog has very different care to a leopard frog which has very different care to a whites tree frog you see so u need to know what kid of frog it is|`|9oiHzdbLaa	They are easy to take care of. serve him fillet mignon with a good savignon from time to time, and he will think the world of you|`|0PUhA2XLaa	Very carefully.

There skin should not ever be dry to the touch.|`|Kbyo9aeUaa	I think you should put it in a tank with water and put wood or something for it to sit on and you should go to your nearest pet shop a ask for some food for it
K8blUjQJaa	No, it won't change his basic personality.  He's probably going to stay active.      He may (uh.. will probably) also continue to spray, especially if there are other cats around that he can see, or that he senses to be a threat to his territory.  That's a threat as HE perceives it, not as we humans see it.    Once they begin to spray, it becomes a learned behavior.  Spraying is a way of marking territory.  Neutered and intact cats can spray.  And it's not just males, either.  Females can and do spray, too.  I have a spayed female who never once had a heat cycle because I had her spayed very young.  She's the "sprayin'est" cat I've ever had!  I've had intact toms that never sprayed indoors.  So it's not all hormones at work.    QUOTE: Lately he has sprayed on nearly anything he claims as his own.. Boxes, clothing, chairs, etc.    These are all items in his territory.  He's marking them as "his" and telling other visitors to stay the **** away.    As for being loving, vocal and active/playful, neutering likely won't change that.  He'll still be your buddy, though perhaps a little mellower and focused on you instead of the girl-cats.  ;)|`|GVZsit7Qaa	Not really, he might get a little calmer, but ive never really seen a drastic change in my cats when they get neutered and spayed.|`|CxFZaHGiaa	Yeah, we neutered our cat, Floyd like half a year ago.    I live with a veterinary's assistant and she assisted with the procedure and from what she told me, the testosterone will deplete and he should mellow out a bit more. Also, Floyd has become more affectionate lately, but that could just be cuz he's finally maturing a bit and realizing who his "mommy" and "daddy" are.     He'll still be playful for awhile, I'm sure, but after that, it's laziness from there.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> No it does not change personalities.|`|C93lTJozaa	your little buddy will get a little fatter, Cats seem to get a little lazy when they get neutered ,On the spraying make sure you keep a  fresh litter box ; If you have more than one cat  get more litter boxes, Sometimes the Vet can help ,Get him checked for a bladder infection ,They don't like to use litter boxes when the bladder is infected..|`|feb2ce97ae6cf4e6440d551a4d76af7faa	No, neutering won't change his personality he'll still be the same|`|0mb78CiWaa	It is supposedd to make them calmer. As well as if he's an outdoor cat he won't wander so far away from home looking for females. He should stop spraying too.   My female is spayed, now her stomach area is tender and she won't let me rub it . I  f you want professional help you could got to your veterinarian, they should be able to tell you the full details.|`|L1EccMeZaa	It shouldn't change his personality, but it will calm him down a lot, and the spraying will stop. My cat has been neutered since he was a year old, and just as affectionate as ever.|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	No, neutering him will not change his personality.    Personality is NOT controlled by his hormones.|`|TBZK5q78aa	The cat will not be as prone to mark territory with his urine... They also will not be as sexually active as before.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	It won't change his personality. He will stop spraying altogether as he will no longer have the territorial instincts of an intact male. I've had several neutered males. My most recent...Morris...was still as zany and nutty as ever after his surgery. He just had no interest in the girls and no marking.
2oN7WrVKaa	Sugar Glider.  Google them!  They are incredible creatures.  Some quick basic info::  They do smell, and there isnt really anything you can do to avoid that besides buying odor absorbing bedding to put under their cage. Males tend to be have a stronger smell then females though. They looovvveee to run around and explore, so you should let them out inside the house, but you need to make sure they are in a closed off area; they can get lost really easy. Ive had tons of scares! As for noises, they have three main ones, barking(sounds like a puppy barking), growling(there isnt an easy way to explain it..maybe like an electric pencil sharpener), and hissing. They bond to humans very well, and will attach to you almost as a mother to a child, this also means they get extremely lonely. It helps if you buy a pouch! Its a small cloth bag with a button that closes it, and you can hang it around your neck. You can stick your sugar inside when you go anywhere, and they are hidden so you can even take them to work. This also helps bonding them to you. Their diet is all over the place. They eat EVERYTHING, from nuts, human junkfood(obviously not recommended, but they might find some laying around), veggies, fruit, bugs, and meat. Gliding does not come naturally either, you have to teach them. And they are also nocturnal animals. Cameras and bright lights hurt their eyes as well. They are very curious animals as well, so when it comes to dogs and cats they well probably just crawl around on them and sniff them.   And as for buying them, you always want to buy the younger ones. Older gliders dont bond to their human as well as babies do. They are a lot of fun, and totally worth buying.|`|u61yKsE3aa	I agree that a sugar glider would be best but you won't be able to train it not to poop or pee in you pocket the sell pouches though that zip that you could keep them in and then just wash the pouches,  These animals do require a lot of care though so do some research first.  If you have questions about them just ask I have 4 and think they are great.   This site has a lot of differant kinds of pouches. http://www.sugarglider63.com/pouches2.ht...  This site has some general care.  http://www.sugar-gliders.com/sugar-glide...    No animal that is small enough to fit in your pocket is going to learn not to rest room.  But there are ways around that like bonding pouches or lining you pocket.  If you get gliders I would go with a pouch not a pocket.  Best of Luck|`|c04049b80f1a87bfc8ca501e3dac485daa	I cannot think of any pet that would be suitable for what you are looking for.    A ferret would be inappropriate. They are high energy (think perma-kitten)|`|GVZsit7Qaa	Unfortuantly I would say a pet rat  Nothing really is going to be fun to keep in a pocket and be clean.    Ferrets are just as messy as rats and easier to spot. They are really good pets though and very fun to have. But a pocket pet I would say Rat. It wont stress from rides every where or bite you.|`|Um209a7raa	dude you should get a naked-mole rat like the one on kim possible  that be soo cool  and you can name him rufus :D
oGVWdnHraa	If your talking about the flap of skin under her chin, thats called a dewlap :) Im not sure about the breathing though, that could be something serious.....      Heres a pic of a bun with a dewlap :)   http://blog.rabbitnetwork.org/wp-content...
1BJtTl8Baa	If she was kept in an area where she was unable to stay out of contact with her poo up to weaning age it could be nutritional or bad habits. I have heard of the other remedies and they work, but besides the store bought remedies and others- you can mix a sprinkle of ACCENT meat tenderizer in some canned food and mix with dry if she eats dry. Its hard to think poop needs to be made to taste bad, but it is a common problem. clean up her mess as soon as you can to avoid and remember with dog food you get what you pay for, go with a good brand. when in doubt you can't go wrong with good ol purina puppy chow.  if there are other dogs they will sometimes eat each others, so you need to do the same to their food so she wont eat their poo. Watch out for those kisses!!LOL.|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	You need to watch her to assure this is not happening.  If you can't watch her at all times, bring her inside.|`|EeJMITyCaa	There are many ways to make your pet not want to eat their poo. I also suspect that your puppy is playing with her poo before she eats it so hopefully these sugestions will eliminate her playing with it too. Deter is a pill/powder that you can put on your puppies food and it makes their poo taste disgusting. A lot of pet stories have it and vets have it too or at least something that does the same thing. I put it on one of my friends puppies food and when he tried to eat his poo he ran around trying to get the taste out of his mouth. Needless to say he never did that again. Next, you can put pinneapple or pumpkin or meat tenderizer in his food. It basically does the same thing that the Deter would do. For dogs that are harder to stop (you try the Deter and it doesn't work) you can try combining all of these methods.     Also, any method involving you telling them no when they try to eat their poo probably won't work because many dogs will learn that when you're their it's not "safe" to eat their poo but when you leave they'll have a field day!!!!!!!|`|AA12069383	Try putting a little pineapple in her food.|`|xz1Eqm47aa	there is some powder you can buy at the pet store or vet. you mix it in their food and it makes their poop unappealing. after you break the habit you can stop adding it|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	There are severtal products on the market for this problem. One is Deter another is Forbid. Your vet will have it. Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't.  I found that changing their food worked. Sometimes they are doing that because they have been fed food that has grains in it and grain doesn't digest. Try changing to a grain-free food and it will probably stop the problem.|`|o6uwV66jaa	it all has to do with sent glands.  and yes as someone has already said before me, putting Pinapple in there food aparently does help.|`|JRtMFmmgaa	My dogs used to do the same thing - it sounds weird but try putting pumpkin with their dog food. They should stop.|`|wvKJLce8aa	One of my dogs used to eat our cat's poo. Someone suggested it's because he could smell something nutritious in it, like protein. Try catching her in the act and tell her "no!"|`|K7BjKJgoaa	My dogs do the same thing. It's because they smell undigested nutrients in the feces. I haven't yet figured out how to break my boys of it, but, hopefully we'll figure it out eventually. It's so disgusting!|`|FvQPiiLHaa	One of my little yorkies does this.  The vet said it can be for a number of reasons...stress over not getting enough to eat, another pet getting their food, boredom.  Trust me when I say NONE of the so called pet store remedies work, we tried them all.  So on advice of our vet, we keep the area pooped scooped immediatley after they go and try to always go out with her and watch her.    Good luck with this one 'cause I know how gross it is and then they want to give puppy kisses...YUCK!|`|thTV5Qi2aa	Give her diet rich in calcium.|`|JWLaPaAGaa	My dog has been doing this recently.  Here is my approach to the problem because it is annoying when they come up to your face with poo breath.  1. Daily exercise - they might be bored.  2. Switch to a better food- might be needing more nutrients  3. I have heard adding canned pumpkin to their food works  4. Pick it up as soon as they poo- get them on a schedule  5. If none of the above works - try the stuff at the petstore that make their poo taste terrible.|`|Bm9cjjY0aa	they dont eat their poo!
1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	you can feed them cooked chicken, scrambled egg, turkey, etc- any meat that isn't salted or seasoned.       Cat treats are fine, and they also make ferret treats. Fillers are fine- everything has fillers and a little won't do damage, but stay away from the high sugar ones (a lot of ferret ones- Yogies for example- are high in sugar which plays havok on their digestive system- ferrets have a lot diseases related to overdosing on sugar).       Other ferret treats- just use a different source of food. I feed EVO ferret, but mine get Zupreem ferret as treats. It is still a normal food, but because they don't get it often- it is a treat.|`|SdS9Qcayaa	all ur answers r interesting but do u really want to know what the best treat for ur ferrets is, TIME WITH U  is the best treat u could ever give ur fur babies.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Fruits and vegetables always make good treats.

I believe that they are just dried liver and are marketed for dogs.   Look for ferret specific treats that do not contain any grains or fillers. Even some fresh meat would work.|`|NLAek2bJaa	I have had ferrets for years. Love them! My latest one just died, 14 years old... they normally dont live that long!! haha   Ferrets like cat food in general to eat normally because they have the same digestive systems as cats so cat treats I would not consider a real treat. My ferrets love Chicken Jerky that is specifically made for a ferret treat. You can get them in any pet store like Petco! They go nuts over them! Thats how I potty trained one of them! Cause he knew he would get a treat for going back in the cage to go. They are pretty smart if you teach them certain things but they just love to play.  The more you handle them the better!  A lot of people say ferrets stink, THEY DO NOT!  Keep their cage clean because they like to burrow through it often.. kind of gross and you can give them a bath.. I have to do it often for mine and I just use puppy shampoo, just stay away from their head and ears when bathing. The shampoo is very gentle, it will not hurt them! I can go on and on! I can answer anything else for ferrets!
EeJMITyCaa	Heck no!!!!! Thats great! It means your dog sees you as the pack leader. Subordinate dogs oftend bring "gifts" to the pack leader. The dog is kind of saying "hey look at what I've done.

The best thing to do is to reward him for it by rubbing him on the head or something.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Mine does it all the time.  He's sharing his toys.

Ha ha.|`|HR9mR2xtaa	It sounds like your dog wants attention, or wants you to play with her.|`|2ersp6Lfaa	Cadet Gregory C is exactly correct.    When an animal brings you something - such as a toy, or a dead rat - it means they respect you as the pack leader.    Well, except for cats. If a cat brings you a dead rat, that means they like you, but they feel they need to protect/feed you, because you are incapable of hunting for yourself. It's still respect though, they care enough to do it for you! :)|`|bg1IyoFTaa	Well I don't think its a problem dude. The dog probably gets lonely and wants to be near you while you are sleeping, and happens to leave the toy next to you. Just to be safe and not make the lady uncomfortable, you can try training the dog to go to sleep when you go to sleep, and discipline it to do so.

Y5FyAekkaa	You will likely need to see a vet for a definite diagnosis but here are some possibilities:    1. Cyst: usually benign. Can be aggravated by itching, not usually a problem until they grow large or impede the dog's ability to function.    2. Canine acne. Yep it happens.    3. Abscesses: from bites or cuts, usually *****, require antibiotics.    4. Staph infection: will sometimes create pimples, though more often on bellies.    If you want to try to wait it out, clip the hair around the area, clean with peroxide and neosporin won't hurt. But if it persists, call a vet.|`|Ed5JlMT9aa	Some dogs are just prone to have them. I don't know of any medicine for it but it is just basicaly a pimple. Try to keep a check on your dogs skin and if you find them, you can pop them like pimples when they are ready. Then clean it with alcohol. Sometimes they can get very large and become cysts that have to be removed by a vet.|`|AaoclPYCaa	I would try to clean it with some peroxide.  Then call a vet.

It is vital you do this. If you do not, they will get eaten by the mother. The Pleco should be fine with the fry, but if he is large, you need to keep an eye on him, just to be sure he is not chasing the Guppy Fry. Keep the fry in a separate tank for at least 3 Months. Guppies develop relatively slowly, and won't be big enough to go into the main tank without fish trying to eat them. Let them develop and they should be good to go at 3, maybe 4 months. Congratulations on the New Guppy Fry.|`|AA11369034	Put floating plants in there or even the regular plastic plants floating will work. Also make sure there is stuff they can hide in low to the gravel.    I'm not sure what kind of breeder net you have, but I have the plastic kind that just floats at the top of the water and it works great.
K8blUjQJaa	I'm not going to go into the details of introducing new cats to other cats in a home-- that would take quite a bit of typing.    But, to answer your question very simply, no-- they may ignore each other.  They may fight each other and never get along despite your best efforts. Or-- They may play with each other and be best buddies, and BOTH come to you for loving.      I have 3 cats.  Two are best friends and are nearly inseparable, but they both sleep with me and my hubby.  They both play with us together.  The third is a bit antisocial when she's indoors, so she mostly ignores the other two who are indoors-only (though she joins in the group play sometimes).  However, she likes the female and hates the male.  Then again, the male is a bit boisterous for her tastes.    It just depends on how well they click, just like people.  We aren't friends with every person we meet, nor do we even like everyone we meet.  Same with cats.    Good luck!|`|3aed218d7132fc2698b7dfdebaab08f6aa	How does your cat act now? If you aren't being overwhelmed by a hyperactive cat, it might be better not to get another cat. If you happen to have a crazy kitten though, getting him/her a friend would be best.     It's very rare for a cat to start ignoring it's humans when another cat is added to the family. All 4 of my cats get at least 5 minutes a day of one on one time with me because they demand it. Just be sure to give them attention when they want it or else they could end up becoming aloof.|`|6qsfdMg1aa	No way!! Cats want your food and want you to pet them! lol     Don't worry! Ive had 5 cats before and Id call all there names and they would come to me and I would pet them. Sometimes when I would get home from work they would be waiting their for my arrival because they know Id feed them lol.     Im sure they wont fight. Maybe when you get one try just bringing it home and keeping it in a separate room and then get the smell of the new cat on you and then rub your cat and it will get used to the scent.     And try placing them in a neutral part of the home and letting them get to know each other. Feed them treats so you can give them positive feed back that its good for them to like eachother.|`|VFQFTeNKaa	> If your planning to get another kitten , think about if they will fight ( NOT PLAY FIGHT ) , be mean to each other..e.g    > No they will not forget about you , if you are worried , play with them 15 minutes everyday.|`|QoAvK80Waa	Lol no. Your older cat the one you have now, will actually get jealous of the new one. It will be very jealous and will be dying for everyone's attention. While the new cat may try to play with the older cat just make sure they get along and that you all play with them for a while maybe get the whole family in a room with lots of space and shut the doors,windows, and hiding places, gets some lil toys like mice and play with the cats so they know they are okay with each other and your older cat knows its not getting replaced okay ;)    hope it goes well!|`|8j70Neqeaa	not at all, we had 1 cat ,and i felt sorry for it being alone, so got another cat.the best thing, they play eat sleep together, are best of freinds,and are still the same towards me, nothing has changed, by getting another cat., except cats are not alone when im gone.|`|8bTder08aa	I have multiple cats, and I can tell you emphatically and definitively that if your cat is affectionate to you now, the only reason he would stop being affectionate if you got another cat would be if that cat became the dominant "lap cat" and kept him/her away from you.    There is a definite dominance hierarchy with my cats.  The "Top Cat" likes to be in my lap or stationed right by me, and he'll discipline any of the other suboridinate cats that come near.  When he decides to go do something else, the second-in-command immediately moves in.  The  2 has two brothers he gets along with, and these three usually do things together, including sitting in my lap.      And so it goes-- they sure don't ignore me, but the subordinate cats have to wait for the dominant cat to go away before they can ask for affection.|`|LZWZXPOeaa	Oh good grief, no.  You feed them and take care of them You are already "mom" to them.    I think it is almost mean not to have two cats.  Everything on earth needs another of its own kind to relate to.      I have never had only one cat.  What a lonely existence that would be for kitty.    They will be happier, and therefore, much better kitties for you and family.

un0C52G8aa	You need to call the animal shelter and file a complaint. Those dogs are trespassing and they could be dangerous. You say they killed two of the cats you were caring for. They could easily do the same to a small child or even you if you do something that sets them off. Dogs can be very dangerous when they are in packs. They may be sweet and docile individually but don't trust them when they gang up like this. They need to be taken away and the owners held responsible.|`|EV6SBovAaa	Aww poor cats. But anyway, we have a huge house, and our neighbor's pets always get in the way. You can build a small fence, not big because that was just be very rude.

By filing a complaint one of several things are possible.  A) They will receive a warning  B) If they cannot provide a license or proof of Rabies Vaccine, the dogs will be quarantined until such time as the owner can establish these and usually pay a fee.  C)They can receive charges for failing to control their dogs.|`|zXknLaTlaa	I have a neighbor who also would let his dogs run loose and poop in my yard, I kept telling him to control his dogs but he wouldn't and I'm sure he was laughing as they pooped in my yard.finely one of the other neighbors called animal control and boy were they after his butt. After catching his dogs loose twice he had to pay a fine of 250 dollars and a warning on the next time the dogs are loose. Here you don't have to give your name to turn in a neighbor to animal control, in fact if I were you I would call animal control and just say there are two stray dogs in my yard and they've been killing my cats. Don't even say it's the neighbors dogs. Believe me some people don't care about other peoples rights and they sure don't sound like they really care for the Dogs.Also the dogs could be attacking the cats because the people don't feed them or just killing the cats because they are the only toys they see they have. I am not a cat person but to take any life in a violent way is just wrong.|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	Call animal control. They will go speak to the people and give them a warning.

lyhnHhuWaa	Nope.  I think it would be hilarious to see someone try to use a vacuum on a cat, though.  The consequences could be tragic for the poor soul making the attempt.  If your cat is having a problem with dander, try adding a humidifier or two to your home.  Heating systems tend to dry the air in the winter months and can cause dander to get out of control.  The humidifiers will help to increase the humidity level and will not only help kitty's skin, but yours as well.  If you're not already, feed your cat wet food.  This will also help to keep him/her well hydrated and fend off excessive dry skin/dander.  Regular brushing can also help to control things.|`|Uy79dKEmaa	No, but I'm still cracking up from thinking about it!!!
95077389acb448d54ce19ee554d055c4aa	i have a few suggestions. first off - set up signs. go into your local feed store &tack store and ask if you can put up signs. some feed/tack stores have a bulletin board for that purpose. Second- spread the word.have a trainer come look at your horse. Your horse may be a perfect match for one of their students, or they can tell their friends. Third- put an ad in the newspaper. et people know what breed your horse is, how old, a smal description, the price you are selling him for, and your phone number. Fourth- put an ad on an online horse website. www.dreamhorse.com is my favorite site. Fifth- Maybe you're horse's price is to high.  maybe lower it down. There are plenty of people looking for an inexpensive horse. If all else fails, give your horse away free to a good home. I know there is someone out there who is interested in a horse like yours. you just have to let peolpe know he's available!! Good Luck!!|`|cea90e3e09ae93a17c2d33f4985855e3aa	I would use dreamhorse.com and equine.com and advertise in the classifieds. Also you might want to check what the horses in your local area are going for that are similar in breed, age and training. I live in California and we have a local free classified ad paper called the nickel. Good luck.|`|AA12329161	Contact your local riding club and see if any one is looking for a horse. They might advertise in their newsletter.    See if you can post notices at local vet offices, tack or feed stores. Post an ad in the paper.    There are also tons of websites that you can post your horse on.   www.equine.com and www.dreamhorse.com are just a couple.|`|f675109cd9ed5988e91dde40f7988593aa	Don't go to an auction. You have no idea who is buying your loving friend. Depending on time, sell to a horseowning friend.  Advertise in a paper, or feed/ tack shops. Go to a horse show and ride around. Youll get lots of offers if you make the horse look good. Trust me. I compete and you always look around for new horses.|`|AA10868773	Advertise in newspaper. Or just give your horse away for free. It is better. Would you sell a human or just give it away to someone with a loving home?|`|AA10525457	You can also say look at something at pet finders.com on the web they normally a section for horses. You can always sell at an auction but I am highly against this since the standards of how they treat animals is very minimal.    Good luck--Jammieg|`|164532aa07a397ad48947b96d8e61cc4aa	You can also check with a large animal vet (not sure if you have a regular one).  They will sometimes know ppl looking for horses.  Ads in paper as well as online are good bets.  Online ads are faster to get the word out - horsedirect.cowboy.com, www.equibus.com.... are good sites.

It's kind of like catch but it is more fun because you get the ball thrown back.  Just be careful throwing the ball to the dog, don't throw it too hard.
81505ebea3f511cdc5db819aaec6bbf7aa	Ultimamente molti allevatori di cani non mozzano pi coda o orecchie ai cani... in realt non vi sono benefici evidenti se non quelli inerenti la sciocca vanit di coloro che li acquistano.  Non dimentichiamo che coda e orecchie hanno funzioni di equilibrio (la coda) e di ascolto e comunicazione (le orecchie).  Diminuire la superficie delle orecchie significa diminuire la superficie atta alla ricezione delle onde sonore e quindi anche parzialmente l'udito.  Vi invito a fare un piccolo esperimento: mettetevi a circa quattro cinque metri dal televisore di casa, volume basso, e ascoltate... poi poi appoggiate le mani aperte alle orecchie avvolgendone la parte esterna con la curva che si forma nella mano tra pollice e indice... noterete un netto miglioramento dell udito...  P.S.:  alcune settimane fa vi fu un servizio in tv che contestava questa usanza e dimostrava dati alla mano che queste mutilazioni sono del tutto gratuite e assolutamente non funzionali...|`|02f515339f28161b237fa77052c2435faa	Penso che bisognerebbe contraccambiare tagliando loro le orecchie..magari la prossima volta ci ripensano!|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Il cane  il migliore amico dell'uomo, ma non sempre l'uomo  il migliore amico del cane|`|771c490aca0ebd9fac7ab6e16bb02cb1aa	Prima di parlare di bestie, ci penserei su un po di volte, inoltre scagliarsi cos contro le persone senza conoscere le problematiche  da ignoranti....   ci sono razze che per diverse ragioni il taglio della coda oltre che un fattore estetico  sicuramente un fattore di utilit: alcune di esse hanno una coda che da adulti  lunga e fine e con buona probbabilit incorre in rischi di rotture, nel caso di rottura in et adulta   molto dolorosa oltre che pericolosa, mentre il taglio della coda avviene praticamente appena nati, l'operazione  velocissima e non comporta traumi per il cucciolo.  A me invece fa schifo chi si permette di giudicare gli altri perch tagliano coda e orecchi ai propri amici e poi il proprio lo abbandona a se stesso e lo tiene segragato in giardino legato ad una catena.  Il mio cane,  vive con me in casa,  ha la coda e le orecchie tagliate, e allora?  Io dedico a lui la maggior parte del mio tempo disponibile,evito di andare in vacanza per non doverlo lasciare solo, perch in Italia esistono solo restrizioni...  questo  amore per il proprio cane, rinunciare anche al proprio divertimento, in favore del proprio amico...   le operazione chirurgiche diciamo estetiche, spesso hanno un'utilit, compreso il taglio delel orecchie, che spesso previene infezioni all'apparato uditivo... perci smettiamola di giudicare gli altri senza conoscere,  molto meglio per tutti.   Se poi ami cos tanto gli animali e i cani,xch non vai come volontaria ad aiutare i canili, a raccogliere i randagi e i cani abbandonati dai padroni che non talgiano la coda...  invece di scrivere ca****e qui  ------  circa le leggi menzionate da qualcuno, fortunatamente, coprono solo alcune razze;   mi paicerebbe capire perch i finti animalisti non si occupano di altro, e quelli veri a salvare gli animali bisognosi, invece di preoccuparsi di quelle che vengono chiamate erroneamente mutilazioni.. forse perch  pi facile giuducare gli altri che rimboccarsi le maniche e far fatica.

Eug52iQDaa	Much of that discharge has to do with what you're feeding.  A diet without wheat, corn or rice is best.      Second, the hair on the nose covering the dog's line of sight needs to be trimmed and kept very short.  These breeds will snap if they cannot clearly see what's going on around them!  They're not mean, it's a reaction, and one you need to be aware of.    There are tear wipes that you can purchase at pet supply shops.  Wipe her eyes down daily.  That should solve the problem.  Also talk with the groomer when you have him done.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	Try a product called Angel Eyes, great for removing stains.

0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	This will probably get deleted for being to chatty but here goes anyway.  It cracks me up how happy people get with the thumbs down.  The person asked for an opinion about dog food and people gave there opinions so since you don't like there opinions you give them a thumbs down.  I don't get it.  If I say I have fed my dog Eukanuba for years and she does just fine on it do I get a thumbs down?  If a dog food works well for your dog and the dog seems to be thriving with no itching or any gastrointestinal problems whats the problem?  All of the dog foods mentioned are AAFCO approved so if your dog is doing well on one of them good.  If it ain't broke don't fix it.  EDIT:  Thanks for the thumbs, you just proved my point.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Nope, Iams is crap. You're exactly right, he was trying to sell it to you because he had it in the office. Vets also get /very/ little nutritional training during their veterinary schooling. They know next to nothing about pet nutrition.    Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.     Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.    Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.    Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!    Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.    Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)    A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.    Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo.     If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.    Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/    Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food    Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:  http://www.rawfed.com/ (RawFed)  http://www.rawlearning.com/ (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)  http://rawfeddogs.net/ (Raw Fed Dogs)  http://www.rawmeatybones.com/ (Raw Meaty Bones)  http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs. BARF Diet)  http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html (Myths About Raw Feeding)    Also remember that freefeeding (leaving food down) is the fast lane to canine obesity. Make sure to have scheduled feeding times based on the feeding instructions on your dog's food.    More on dog food:  http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...

I researched dog food for hours on end. My dogs were eating Wellness, which is pretty good. The reason I wanted to switch was one of my dogs has been eating the carpet and his own poop. I knew he wasn't getting all the nutrients that he needed so I thought switching his food would be worth a try. I finally decided to go with Orijen (hard to find). Order if you have to and try it. I can't tell you how much better my dog is on this food. Honestly, I have noticed a huge difference in his coat, energy, and his poop is less smelly and nice and firm. My Vet recommends Science Diet but I know that Vets get paid by certain dog food   companys so they push their products.   Although it all depends on the dog. All dogs are different so check out the two sites I have listed below. They were a huge help. Good luck.|`|gUsJlTvKaa	There is no one brand that is better than all the others, alot of the high quality Dog Food is similar in quality. My list of best foods in no exact order would be:    1. Science Diet - Recommend by most vets and easiest food to find. This is a very high quality dog food and it would be rare to find someone who would argue otherwise.    2. Royal Canin - Very good food with alot of breed specific food eg, Labrador, German Shepard, Poodle.    3. Eukanuba - Very good food and alot of good dog breeders use this.    4. Nutra Choice - This food is really good especially if your dog has skin conditions. It is also slightly cheaper than the other foods but just as good as quality as them.    Iams is a pretty good food but not as good as any of the foods mentioned above. It is also Obviously cheaper than these foods, baring Nutra Choice maybe.|`|tz2f6iwHaa	You're vet is being paid by Iams to say that.    The best dog food is organic meat, carrots, and brown rice.    Since that takes a lot of effort, any food containing no chicken by products or chicken meal, no grains, and no preservatives/fillers.    Taste of the Wild is very good quality. So is Royal Canine, Nutro, and Evanger's.     Crap dog food like Iams, Kibble N Bits, Beneful, etc... is so terrible that they actually pour lard over the food so it will appeal more appetizing to the dog.|`|Up2Plb2zaa	Pedigree is by far the best. its a perfect price, great variety, and all that other crap. my dog looooooooves it. also it seems dogs like tinned food better than dry.|`|MIddpTcgaa	most food that you find in grocery stores is junk. Check the ingredients, as weird as that sounds. If theres any corn do not get it. Or if the food has by-products. I'm currently feeding my dogs a brand called diamonds? i think. They love it. Inovva is pretty expensive i must say. If you have any small pet stores near you (not pet co or petsmart) go there and they usually give you really good advice.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	I'm surprised at all the pedigree suggestions.  That is dog junk food.  It'll be one of the first pulled when there is a dog food recall.  Its all filler, like corn, rice, wheat...it may seem like a good deal for the money, but its not high nutrition.    There are quite a few good brands out there. I have to be very picky about my dog's food because we have struggled with allergies for so long.    Right now he is eating Dick Van Patten's Natural Balance Venison and Potato, or Duck and Potato, or Salmon and Potato.  They are grain free allergy formulas and it has done wonders to clear up his bad skin allergy symptoms.  Brands like Solid Gold or Innova are also great choices.  You won't be finding them at your local grocery store, for Innova I have to go to our local feed store or privately owned pet supply because I have not seen a petsmart or petco that carry that food.    When you look at the first few ingredients of your dogs food, do they make sense or are they just filler.  Ingredients are listed from most to least in portions in the food.    For Pedigree's Adult Complete Nutrition the first five ingredients are:  Ground Whole Corn, Meat And Bone Meal, Ground Wheat, Corn Gluten Meal, Animal Fat    In my dog's food (Natural Balance - Venison and Potato):  Sweet Potatoes, Venison, Venison Meal, Potato Protein, Canola Oil (which offer Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acid)    It is specific about what type of meat and what type of carbs are in the food and is GRAIN FREE.      READ INGREDIENT LABELS!    http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/  http://www.naturapet.com/  http://www.naturalbalanceinc.com/|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Iams certainly is not the best & is filled with fillers & low cost ingredients. Check out these 2 sites for more info. This one show you how the popular brands rate & notice Iams is not even 3 stars out of 10.    http://dogfoodchat.com/dog-food-ratings/    This one teaches you how to rate food for yourself & what the ingredients really are & what to avoid.    http://www.acreaturecomfort.com/ratingpe...    I personally feed Natural Balance or Blue Buffalo both are good brands & NB cost about the same as Iams.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	The best commercial dog food is a food that does NOT contain corn, wheat, soy, by products, animal digest or animal fat.. it also doesn't contain extra sugars, dyes or chemical preservatives. The best food also has a named meat source as the first 2-3 ingredients.  Some of the good choices..... Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul, Merrick, Wellness Super 5 Mix, Wellness Core, Canidae ALS, Canidae Grain Free, Taste of the Wild, Solid Gold, Innova, just to name a few.  The absolute best most natural way to feed any dog is a raw diet.    ****** poop eating and chewing up of objects, carpets, etc has nothing to do with nutrition....in other words it has absolutely nothing to do with something lacking nutritionally in a dogs diet********|`|Ei85kgfdaa	Nope, Iams is just junk. You are right your vet is just trying to push it on you because he gets backed for it.    I feed wellness currently. Its a great food. I would also suggest checking out other high quality foods like innova, evo, orijen, solid gold, timberwolf or eagle pack. Stay away from foods with lots of fillers like grains and 2ng or 2rd grade meats.|`|26PPwzrWaa	Whats with all the pedigree supporters. Pedigree is what resulted in my dogs back legs giving out at 6.     Yes your vet was just selling you food. I would confront him, but you dont have to.     www.dogfoodanalysis.com can help you with finding good quality food in ratings.   www.dogfoodproject.com can help you with what to avoid and where the money really goes.

bepZupAfaa	hawaii and california ferrets are illegal. New York City they are illegal.    the main reason they are illegal is because there is confusion to whether ferrets are a wild animal or a domesticated animal. most states recognize them as domesticated exotic pet.     there is all the concern of the ferrets becoming feral packs that would destroy native small animals in each state.  the disclosure to this is that ferrets don't survive in the wild. most ferrets in the US are already descented and neutered when they are purchased so if by chance a few got out into the wild they couldn't reproduce any way.    also ferrets may be legal in your state by may not be legal in the city/town or county that you live in. you should check with the wildlife conservation groups in your area. beware that even if a pet store sells ferrets it still may not be legal to own one in your area.    hope this helps|`|CxFZaHGiaa	I know it's illegal to own a ferret in California. I know it's okay in Oregon and New York.    Other than that, google it, I'd say.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I know they are illegal in California and New York City. They are illegal in some other states and sometimes a city but not the state, but I couldn't give you a list.|`|44kEtDvIaa	California has a ban on them for sure.  Believe it's the only state and they're close to changing that.  California bans a lot of animals, particularly anything they consider as being exotic.  And ALL animals will bite .. and bite hard.  It's not their biting, but why they bite that would be of concern.  They do not bite for no reason.|`|1a66e55f2184fe6adca74fb4a9e4fd8caa	In California, and New York City. Some other cities have ferret bans- you will just have to call your local city hall.|`|J79WYzO9aa	Ferrets should be banned in all states! They are horrible little critters that bite! HARD!!!   You can have them in Texas.|`|SdS9Qcayaa	if i had to live with some one like Hope i'd bite her too take a chill pill girl, ferrets r the best pet u could ever ask for they r loving gentle love kisses and hugs and cuddling o and don't forget playing, i know that ferrets r not banned in canada but it is illegal to breed ferrets in canada, and they r banned in California for what reason i do not know sorry, o and the reason i know what ferrets like is because i have 8 of them that's how i know. and Hope if u took that chill pill ferrets might like even u
44kEtDvIaa	Sneezing is quite common in rats for about a week after you bring them home.  Stress related.  They don't like change and going from pet store to your home has them a bit upset right now, but they will get over it.  Get rid of the wood chips.  You should see a change shortly.  Can check site below which has good info on rates .. also good links to other sites where you can check on medical issues and care.  Enjoy your pets ... they're great!
u61yKsE3aa	Yes you can always call.  Is there any form of shelter.  Unfortunately animal laws aren't as strict as they should be if there is shelter food and water than usually there isn't anything they can do.  You can always make the call though and let animal control make the decision when they investigate.  Poor pup I hate when people get a dog just to leave it outside they and any animals for that matter needs care and love. Some people just suck.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Of course and don't be afraid of calling animal control. Think of it as doing a good deed and think that you are saving a dog's life. I have a boxer mix and even when it is cold or windy, I put him inside the laundry room. My daughter puts blankets so he won't be so cold. Sometimes I think my dog lives better and gets treated better than I do. Oh well, I love my dog. Good luck with animal control. Please do something ASAP. People should not have pets if they can't handle the responsibility. That's called animal abuse and negligence.|`|mbuB22D2aa	ya|`|ixEL82K1aa	I believe you can, for neglect & it's disturbing the neighborhood. Is the dog chained up? Does it get fed?    poor dog ;(|`|IMBBiFQvaa	Of course!  What they are doing is "Animal Abuse".  >:(|`|c5cae0d574a0810205fe6b648a4431d4aa	Yes you can call animal control. You could also call the police since the dog is barking/|`|I8Y2cz4haa	I would for sure. Animal neglect! Bust their doggy-abuse butts!|`|0aLWbvC2aa	I live in Los Angeles too and it is pouring rain. Of course you should call animal control. Where is the owner?|`|ZUUmNaO0aa	dont even hesitate. keep in mind that they will be brought to your local shelter and unless they are small cute and friendly they will probably be euthanized.  Bad pet owner suck.
rLDf1gGGaa	Labrador  Temperament:  This breed is highly intelligent, loyal, and deeply devoted. The Labrador Retriever is reliable, affectionate, and thrive on human companionship and attention. They are absolutely wonderful with children and get along exceedingly well with other dogs. They may be reserved with strangers and make good watchdogs. If this breed is left alone for extended periods of time without attention or stimulation they will become lonely, bored, and destructive.'    Golden Retriver  Temperament:  Golden Retrievers are loveable, polite, and highly intelligent. They exude charm and confidence. They are sweet, eager to please, and devoted family companions. They do not do well if left alone for extended periods of time or they will become mischievous and destructive. They have a tendency to be overly exuberant and distractible. They are always gentle and patient with children. They are friendly with other pets. In fact, they are friendly with everyone. They tend to bark as a form of greeting. The Golden Retriever is not well suited for a two career family as they require an inordinate amount of human interaction and companionship.    Niether are as hyper or as crazy as your lead to believe, but still require quite abit of exercise. However remember as puppies they are still hyper.  Adopt and Save a life.|`|dw4npZpPaa	They are very similar dogs, both loving and friendly. I've had both, but idk why, I just love Golden Retrievers :)|`|HEgcqXZVaa	It's a matter of personal choice I'm sure. I can assure you that no matter which breed you choose you will be more than happy with it as long as you choose a breeder who has dogs with a great pedigree.     I have a Golden Retriever, and I love her to death.     Go with the one that steals your heart the most.|`|TomEwMHMaa	Both are wonderfull loving dogs. However the Golden Retriever sheds something terrible.|`|1fe38b8082e3a7523e8af4f7eabfdf6caa	They both have their ups and their downs.  Neither are better dogs, for some people a golden is better because maybe they like grooming. For other people it's labs because they like their boundless energy.    But they are both VERY over bred right now.  So I would only adopt one.|`|x7G7PH6jaa	golden.... not by much but they are... but it also depends on how you raise it....|`|J37f6WYXaa	I like both the same way because there both cute.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Personal preference.  Very similar, but used for slightly different purposes, especially in hunting.  Suggest you look them up on the internet and make your comparisons.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Aren't they the same dog in different colors?  (red and yellow)|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Neither    Both are too overbred right now.  Sad cuz they are both excellent dogs otherwise.|`|39ixfEIraa	The golden, I have both and The golden is very obedient. The lab is just goofy and eats things. Ive been helping with dogs forever...Golden retriever would be the best..|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	all dogs are good there are just bad owners, how about a rescued greyhound if you looking to get a larger dog. gentle, sweet and actually very laid back, and an indoors dog they need cooling and heat because of lack of Body fat and short fur.
ld5Bvuvgaa	I find there are mixed reactions about my dobie. A lot of people say "She's going to be big and scary eh?" (She's only about 7 months but already quite large!) Most delivery people say "I'm not looking forward to coming into your garden once she's fully grown" lol. Some parents pull their children out of the way when walking past us. But there are plenty of people who go "Oh my god, a Dobermann! Can we say hello?" and lots of folk just come straight up and start cuddling her and letting her kiss them (obviously these people already know the Real Dobermann temperament).   Regarding how she looks, she is completely au naturale: floppy ears and a long tail. I have had mixed reactions about this also. Some people have to ask what breed she is. Most say they prefer how she looks, but some say they'd prefer to have the tail docked. One stranger came right out and said "You Should have her docked". The cheek! I promptly told him it is now illegal here and that I would rather come home to a wagging tail. Don't get me wrong, I don't condemn docking for working dogs, but for a pet it's completely unnecessary.    Hmm a story about my Dobermann.  Well once I was brushing my teeth and my dog came through to see me tail wagging and a ball in her mouth. She gave me that 'I wanna play' look and promptly dropped the ball in the toilet! Luckily it hadn't been used beforehand! I couldn't stop laughing and she seemed to be rather pleased with herself too!|`|Ei85kgfdaa	My first transport I had a natural eared male(black and tan, docked, ears layed pretty nicely). I took him out of the car at the vet and a lady from her car called out and asked what breed he was. She couldn't believe he was a doberman. I had to hold up his ears just to show her his head shape. True, though maybe not a very interesting story. I will always remember it.    I also love it when I get a foster dobe who leans. Nothing like 70lbs(or more) up against your leg looking for some petting, lol.|`|qgeI6Chxaa	We took our Doberman to Petsmart when she was about 5 months old. People would start to come down the aisle, see her, and decide that they didn't need anything there after all.|`|5Kt8qlytaa	I have two very beautiful and very large Doberman's.  It's funny to see how people look at me when I'm walking them.  (I'm rather on the petite side).  Most guys that I meet seem to be very intimated.  I just can't figure out whether they are intimated by my dogs or that someone my size can handle both of them at the same time.     P.S. no one could ever really be intimated by either of them.  They are both big babies.
SdS9Qcayaa	i wouldn't worry about it i have 8 ferrets and not one of them r the  same size they go from little Bindi to the mighty boomer and they r siamise and silver ferrets ages 8mon to a year. they will start to fill out now and will look bigger so don't worry unless u r one of those ppl where size matters, love knows no size good luck|`|44kEtDvIaa	How big do you want them to get?  Nothing worse than a ferret on steroids!  At a year, they won't get too much larger, but may fill out some.  Check site below for more info and links to other ferret sites.|`|bepZupAfaa	female ferrets average between 1-3 lbs when full grown. males 3-5 lbs.    i have 5 ferrets and i have one female that barely weighs a pound. she is the smallest and oldest of my brood. she's 5 yrs old now. one of my males is about 3 1/2 pounds and he's the oldest male. 5yrs old.my 4 month old female is bigger than the  5 yrs old female. all of my ferrets are different lengths too. some of them are fluffier too . their size and weight depends the ferret just like the difference between people.    just keep feeding properly and they will more than likely start to fill out more.    hope this helps|`|SvMwEoLUaa	Yes.|`|w4EfMCMZaa	your ferrets will grow. just give them the food you have been giving them and make sure they stay healthy. ive been raising ferrets most of my life.....trust me they will grow|`|NLAek2bJaa	Some ferrets get bigger than others. I had an albino that stayed very small, but my other two I have now are a bit bigger! Of course they are both brother and sister and the male is fatter than the female so gender can also help with that. Ferrets can eat cat food if they like it so try giving them cat food. It has more fat in it. It wont hurt them because they have the same digestive systems as cats. If not, just ferret food it is, just always make sure they have food in their dish. They will grow to where they are supposed to be!
X7i59NeIaa	I rescued a small dog like that and had the very same problem. You said the dog had been abandoned. Well, I don't care how old they are when they are abandoned, it affects them. I finally figured out with this little guy that he somehow associated the crate with punishment and abandonment. I no longer use a crate for him but have created a small space in my room that is his and he is now a very happy little dog. I would say that you may never be able to use a crate with this dog. Good Luck|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	You sure have a stubborn pup on your hands!    You have to make the crate a pleasant place that she wants to go into.  Check out these websites.  Hopefully they will be helpful.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	The age factor(when you got her) could very well play a part.    As long as she is healthy, getting frequent potty breaks(not crying because she has to pee) and plently of exercise/attention then she should learn to accept it. I would suggest you start feeding her in the crate as well. Be sure to leave it open 24/7 and throw lots of treats and goodies in there for her during the day. The sooner she learns the crate is her place(loving it or just tolerating it) the better and she will be easier to live with as an adult if/when she needs to be crated.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	I have a dog too, I'm stumped as well. I think that you should schedule an appointment with the vet soon to make sure that there's not any other problems because it appears to me that you're doing everything right.|`|85d25c63c9c8d4e4ad0e4c097927a33faa	It may be that she is scared of abandonment, but it doesn't sound like that cause you sound like a very well educated owner who has covered all the obvious bases. I am inclined to say she just doesn't like the crate!|`|hbj6vGE4aa	You BET that some dogs just don't like crates.    Case and point, my mom's shih tzu.  Every time his is crated, he throws up and/or poops.  But he doesn't do that if left out of the crate.    Go figure...|`|1fe38b8082e3a7523e8af4f7eabfdf6caa	Watch this video: http://www.petvideo.com/index.cgi?catego...    There are also other videos that might help you out.  I used this website when I got my puppy.  He is crate trained housetrained, knows tricks, walks well on a leash, ect.    Good Luck!|`|7yRGUtgMaa	Yeah she simply does not like the crate. I have a Yorkie myself and she was terrible when I first got her. You said she's out all day. Well put her in a little more often. Like feed her in there just small things like that pushing her more and more into the crate. Just get her use to it. Small dogs are SO stubborn. About the barking thing, I'll let you know when I find out myself. Another way is just to ignore her, she'll stop. I put my MP3 in my ears when my dog is in her crate, that bark is SO annoying. But yelling does nothing, buy some wet food and put it in the crate everything you feed her. Then she'll go in more often cause she'll think she's getting fed. Then you start praising.|`|DrbzkoSfaa	try wrapping an old fashined alarm clock in blanket, or get that mothers womb bear from the infants department at wal-mart, and put it in the crate thats what i did.  another idea wold be warm water bottles.|`|Y5FyAekkaa	First of all 8 weeks is a perfectly acceptable age since most can leave mom by 6 weeks so don't let anyone give you any lip about it :).    As far as crate training goes it is a waiting game. Frequently use the word no and then ignore her. You can try putting a sheet on the cage. On technique that has worked is to put her in the cage  and leave the room. Wait until she stops barking then go back in, praise her greatly and take her out. Try a smaller cage to increase her feelings of security.  You can look into a pill called Calm Moments which is an all natural herbal supplement that can help her stay calmer during the nights. You will have to check about a dose for her age. You are doing the best things and problem the problem will start to iron itself out. Try an extensive play right before bed to wear her out then institute "quiet time".|`|iWhWUqW4aa	Hahaha. My maltese is 2 years old and she still acts like that...and it wasn't for lack of me trying!!! I truely believe some dogs just hate crates. But nevertheless, she had to stay in 1 when I was at work. Good luck :)|`|JWLaPaAGaa	I don't know what breed of dog your puppy is but most small breeds don't leave their litter until 10-12 weeks. She might be lonely. They have these little pet soothing pals at Petsmart that I would recommend. Or if you dont want to spend the money you could make something yourself. The soothing pal at Petsmart is a little dog toy you can put in the microwave and it is suppose to comfort the puppy. (make them think they are sleeping with a litter mate). The other option is to get some fabric and make a small bag in which you would put uncooked rice in and sew it up. I made bags for my two chihuahuas and they love them.     Just make sure you don't talk to her or comfort her when she is crying or it will never stop. My two pups took a couple of days to stop their little crying fit at night, although the second pup we had to put the crate on our bed until he got use to the idea of sleeping by himself.   Good luck!|`|26PPwzrWaa	Right now she is just young. I would also start getting into puppy kindergarten to let her know what a dog is supposed to do.     Once she is potty trained, you may want to start leaving her crate door open when she is loose and she will learn to love it. Thats how my 11 year old dog started going into her crate to lay down. She didnt start to this year and I have had her since around 3 months.     For the barking, try putting a blanket over the crate.     Yes, ignore her, she is not truly hurt. A mom dog would ignore that kind of racket. She might look to see if the pup was hurt, but if not hurt, she wouldnt intervene.     www.flyingdogpress.com Read the free articles on this website. You have to sign up for a free account, but they are eye opening. I highly recommend It takes a pack to raise a puppy.|`|Kcfh2djNaa	My Beagle absolutly HATES her kennel, always has.  She hasn't been in a kennel now for over 3 years.  When she was a baby she wouldn't calm down in her kennel ever, we tried everything, making the kennel smaller, putting a blanket over it, shirt that had our scent, ect.  The only way she would be quiet at night was if one of us had our fingers in her kennel touching her.  Needless to say she soon migrated into our bed at night so we could get some sleep.  For a few years if we left we put her in the kennel, but you literally had to pick her up and put her in, then quick shut the door before she escaped.  We tried feeding her in there, that didn't work either.  As she got older we just folded up the kennel and put it away.  Now she sleeps on the couch when we are gone and sleeps in bed with us at night.|`|QoAvK80Waa	lol dont worry, my puppy was just like that :P but now he sleeps with me and all since he's so small and its okay. He is crate trained tho, I keep him in it during the day while at school. so dont fret over it, what i did before i let my baby sleep with me was i'd put him in the crate and i'd make a cot on the floor for me just so he'd know im there. I slept on the floor next to him for one day then i'd leave and i'd move my cot farther each night. this seemed to help him. since he could see me and he didnt notice that i was moving away farther each night ;P fhe never barked since he could see me and all, so finally i got all the way to the edge of my bed so i was far and he didnt mind since i could see him and he could see me! and the next night I got on my bed, and he didnt mind just stood up and looked at me, once he saw me he layed down and went to bed, never again did he bark. He sleeps with me now, but he does jump off my bed and crawl into his crate and sleep lol its usually me who goes to get my fluffy cuddlemate. so dont worry about it, jsut do something like that to help the lil girl ;) or if u dont wanna sleep on the floor and move and all, just take an old shirt wear it for a day and then at the end of the day put it in there with her. once she gets use to it just take the shirt away and your good, you can also do this with a rag of some sorts just keep the rag in your shirt, for a while.
9UvkRIdraa	After reading this, the only thing I can think of is this:  What happens when the dog gets loose again/isn't in the pen, and a child happens to be near him, and the dog gives him/her a "warning" bite, and kills him/her?   I don't think the dog gave you a "warning" bite. You had many layers on, if you hadn't, it would have been very bad.    But yes, I think you did the right thing, by staying still and not showing fear.  It does sound like the owner over-reacted a little, because the dog bit you after the owner got between you.  But maybe he was worried that you would get hurt.  I think that the owner needs to be more careful, and make sure that dog can't get out and hurt someone, or kill someone.    By the way, I love dogs! I just worry about someone, especially children, getting hurt/killed.|`|Eug52iQDaa	The owner over-reacted.  But first, he didn't have a lock on a gate that let you into a yard where the dog was not contained.  The owner should be spanked!  The dog performed very well.  Bless your heart for not reporting the incident.  The owner needs to pull his head out, however, and make sure that the public is protected from his dog.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	l know exactly what method was used to train this dog to attack and kill .Police dogs are NOT taught to kill b ut attack on the arm as a restraint.You were not at fault luckily you were not hurt badly and the fault rests entirely with the owner as he over reacted the dog sensed his fear and assumed that you were a potential threat.Forget the tail wagging that is not the issue.l can assure you once they are trained to actually KILL not just Attack they can never be turned around and l doubt even the'Dog Whisperer' would try as this is aggression and dominance towards humans forget other dogs l would hate to see what he would do to them.Yes,you were right telling the owner to keep the dog in the pen when you were visiting but what if someone unexpectedly turns up with young kids or even no kids and the dog is loose,the owner is liable and the dog will be put down.if it is trained guard dog and does this job that is fine but if the owner has him at home he is obligated by LAW to always have him in a pen and completely restrained.You must be very good natured to accept his apology admittedly l would too BUT many would not as the dog's reaction was HIS FAULT as the dog sensed fear,anxiety and reacted accordingly.Yes you were given a warning and this is not dominance now this is pure and simple aggression as the dog has been trained for this Job and this job ONLY|`|26PPwzrWaa	Exactly, TRAINED to kill. The dog is not safe unless rehabilitated. I dont like those training guard dog places that teach a dog to bite on command, for all you know the dog could've reacted to an unintentional signal from his current owner that he was taught.     Yes the owners reaction caused much of the issue.     No dog trained to kill accepts new members to the established pack he is dominant of  Pack membership and domanincy is by no means that easy.|`|UETAqR8Taa	if he broke through to the skin, make sure your tetnus is up to date.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	If dog didn't break skin then the bite was not intended to do damage.  The dog could have easily bitten through a thick jacket.    That said this dog is very poorly trained an a liability.    Any dog that is trained in bite work should be 100% responsive to its handler at all times.   A properly trained dog would have been easily controlled with a recall command or a simple sit stay.    Either this dog is poorly trained or its owner is entirely incapable of properly handling a dog with this type of training.  In all likelihood it is a combination of both as not responsible trainer would have sold the dog to someone so obviously ill-equipped to handle it.    Allowing the dog to be the dominante one in order for it to protect you is also not the proper way to train or handle these dogs.    Allowing the dog to be dominte over household members is allowing the dog to be incharge which is again very dangerous with bitetrained dogs.    The owner very much caused the reaction in this dog.  His fear and anxiety stemming from his inability to properly control the dog set of the dogs instinct to protect causing the bite.       Also just for future referance a wagging tail does not alway indicate a friendly approch.  Dogs wag their tails for many reasons.  You have to learn to read the various waggs along with other body language.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	That guy is talking horse s***. He probably got his dog out of the Sunday Newspaper. NO TRAINER trains a dog to kill. And furthermore no trained dog would've let you go with out at least a command to release and seeing how he attacked after being told no, I doubt he'd be the type of dog to release when told no. If he were all your big mouthed friend said he was you'd be in the hospital. You did all the right things except for: Stay away from idiots. Now you have a lesson learned: Idiots can get you in trouble.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	security dogs should be restrained when there are strangers around.  They should always be in the presence of their handlers - sounds like this handler is a moron and cannot control the dog and doesn't know what or how to produce proper responses.      Yes, it sounds to me that the reaction of the owner is exactly what cued the dog to bite.  He saw his human acting like something was terribly wrong with your presence, so the dog reacted to his energy and behavior.   This owner is clueless.   Be careful.  I would not be at all surprised if this poor dog really hurts someone.  He needs some help.  I don't think there is any help for this idiot who owns him.  The best thing for the dog would be a new home and intelligent owner.  No matter what, be very careful.  When this owner is so out of control, it throws the dog into a frantic state - signals are confused and the dog reacts wrongly and in  appropriately.   Take care.

4aAhEK9daa	If you know the mother cat is Siamese/Burmese how could this kitten be ANY breed?  And who had unaltered Siamese and Burmese cats that they crossbred?    Your kitten is a cat of no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  Her colour is Silver Mackerel Tabby.  I highly doubt her mother was really "Siamese x Burmese" as I don't see the least bit of either of these breeds in this kitten.    Scorpio - the American Shorthair is a specific breed of cat.  The term for a cat of no particular breed is DOMESTIC Shorthair.    And other person - tabby is a coat pattern - not a breed.|`|xYTagSIyaa	Silver long haired mackerel.

Very rarely is is a true behavioral problem only. It could be just a coincidence that it started after you moved. Most likely if you have her examined and have a urinalysis run at the vets-it will turn out to be a urinary tract infection but females can be prone to incontinence(which can be rectified thru hormone therapy)Also is she eating and drinking normally -excessive urination or polyuria can be an indicator of a much more serious metabolic disorder like Cushings or diabetes.|`|1ca2236b157e74218fe4483ca0245a16aa	I had a Beagle that would pee on the floor every time I left the house.

AA11916717	I work for a vet who does a lot of orthopedic procedures.  Please take this kitten either to a vet or to the shelter where it can get the proper help.  It HURTS to put a joint back into place! The kitten would require anesthesia. Putting a shoulder back into place isn't so easy, sometimes needing surgery. If you take it to a vet, get an estimate first. If the cost is too much , then ask them about alternatives.  If you choose the shelter, be aware that yes, they may chose to humanely euthanize the kitten.  I DO recommend a vet exam first though.|`|fd1164cd43c87a11e389768796c51b04aa	Kitten needs to go to the vet, In my experience most vets will let you pay on the bill without having to come up with money right away. have them check with their vet and see if he won't do this for them.  They also need to know if the kitten does have or will come down with the health problems the other kittens had. I do not know what health problems kittens had, but if it was feline leukemia it usually is a death sentence. Please everyone get feline leukemia shot for your animals, it is a horrible death sentence for your cat. we lived with it on 2 kittens my daughter found. it and break your heart what they go through.|`|AA10974581	Try  to see if vet will allow payment plan.

AA11481893	Cats are very smart animals while dogs make good companions.    U choose|`|AA11068280	Some people like dogs better. Some people like cats better. Me, I have both. We have 2 dogs and 4 cats. Both are good, in different ways. Dogs are fun, they'll play with you and they're always happy to see you when you come home from work or school or wherever. But at times they require lots of attention. Cats, on the other hand, are low-maintenance. They don't require as much attention as dogs. But sometimes that can be a bit boring.|`|AA12310687	Dogs are better companions if you want a pet that will always be interested in you, but cats are more self-reliant if you are away from home a lot.|`|AA11947384	I have 3 dogs and 1 cat.  The only cat I will own is a barn cat that never comes in my house to shed all over my furniture, jump on my counter tops shred up corners of my couch and chairs dig in my house plants...the list can go on.  I cant stand haveing hair all over the furniture, in my bed on my clothes.  One of my dogs is allowed indoors and is much easier to take care of than any indoor cat Ive had.  She is a Jack Russel Terrier and has a very short coat so their is a minimal amount of shedding.  She scratches at the door when she needs out and doesnt need a litter box to stink up the house with, it was easy to train her to stay off the furniture, she alerts me when she hears someone snooping around outside my house at night.  She is able to stay in the backyard with my other 2 dogs when we are out of town, loves to entertain my young nephews by playing tug'o'war, keep away and fetch.  I seriously enjoy my little dog much more than any cat I've had.  Dogs are more mobile...  You can take them a lot of places.  I take all 3 of my dogs with me when I go to the river, when I go work with my horses...  Not that I dislike cats I just think dogs are really awesome pets.  Dogs are also very affectionate like cats.|`|4dfbfc6ca8605d789ba94ca5085c2e62aa	Not easy to answer, depends on what kind of dog or cat and where will they live, small apartment, large house, etc..and how much attention can be given to them.some don't need much some need alot, Just get some books and read alot.|`|AA12291003	cats are better cuz when you hafta be gone for the weekend they don't need to be let outside|`|AA11829742	i love both|`|6cf0296c157360630e8fc060c335bde5aa	DOGS!!!!!!!|`|AA12377991	I like both but im really picky about dogs...right now i have cats and dogs but really i prefer cats easier to take care of...|`|AA12074436	Personally, I prefer dogs.

f222ec8e4c612ae87038d4145a427365aa	Ask 20 Vets and you will most likely get 20 different answers.  After 18 years as a Vet tech and groomer, this is the answer that seems most reasonable to me.  First lets start with why "almost all"  dogs will eat cat poop.  Cats, whether they eat commercial food or live outside where they can eat rodents, bugs or whatever eat a very high amount of protein.  Bugs and things are 100% protein.  The high amount of protein is digested so fast that when it comes out it STILL smells like food to a dog.  When dogs eat their own or another dogs, it may mean that the dog food you are giving him is too high in protein. It goes through their system so fast it too still smells like food to them.  All dogs are different.  Some do very well on high protein some need less. In Some horrible foods like Ole Roy (God I wish Wal-Mart would stop selling that crap) protein is really the ONLY thing in it that has any nutritional value. Try finding another good  dog food that  your dog likes that is lower in protein.  There is also a  product called forbid that you sprinkle on their food that is supposed to make their bowel movements smell badly to them.  I have even heard of people putting meat tenderizer on their food.  They like the taste of it, but it makes their movements smell pretty bad. This is much easier than going out in the yard and looking for the piles and putting something on it, don't you think?|`|AA10440692	Put tobasco sauce on it. That should work.|`|2abce9c2cdd6859bab3bd9ac53d8d3b7aa	my three pugs did the same thing. we got them to stop by changing their diet. we give them a mixture of SCIENCE DIET and generic brand dog food 6 days a week but on wedensday, they get 2 cups each of nutritious wet-based dog food.|`|AA11920701	the reason why your dog is eating the dog poop or cat is because they feel that he/she is missing some mineral from their diet so they compliment it from that, also as eating grass, but eating grass is not harmful in any way, BUT when they are eating the poop that has so many bacteria, talk to the vet or go to petsmart or a pet store to look for some medicine that will make the poop taste bad so they won't eat it, if he is eating his poop then give him the medicine, if he is eating some other dog's poop give the other dog the medicine, good luck. =)|`|801579bb68cf3e6bfd7d7ceda75231f1aa	Green beans.  Put them in the food.  Every client we told to do this, it worked.  Plus its something you probably already have in your pantry.|`|AA12384190	why don't you just clean the poop up? Maybe he'll lose his taste for it.|`|aeb08e46ace6f24e619c41906f6fc42faa	The vet or stores like PetSmart has some medicine that you can give him to break him of his habit. It makes the feces less appetizing (yea, I know) and gets him out of the habit in about a week or two. Cost is about $10 at PetSmart.

AA10798914	My sister is a breeder and she has found that using dawn dish soap to bathe the dog does not hurt her or the pups and it is non toxic and for some reason kills the fleas and provides a deterrent to further fleas|`|AA11488344	OK, you need to get both parents, and all those puppies to a vet ASAP! I'm not sure what kind of stuff they can give the puppies, but a vet will know exactly how to fix the problem. New mothers and puppies should be going to the vet regularly anyway......    The vet office I work at uses Frontline for fleas, but I am sure several brands work well. The vet may also be able to use "capstar" on the puppies, which will kill them immediatly, but it won't prevent future ones. It will at least give you time to rid the parents of fleas.    Either way, talk to your vet.|`|AA11724568	Try using a cedar shaving filled bed pillow underneath them, as that will help to get rid of the fleas, I think most pet stores sell them.|`|AA12379205	First, do not treat the pups as they are too young, second call your vet he/she will be able to give you the best answer to your problem.|`|d0480d6f09965e21d2351a58e35a0d63aa	Get a flea comb from Walmart or a pet store and get busy.  Use a bucket of water with a little dishsoap in it to contain all the critters you comb out until you can flush 'em down the toilet.  Wash and vacuum all the bedding.    This is extremely effective when done once a day for several days.  I would avoid using all chemicals at this time.|`|63a25b5df46ff7a6e3735d805f681f86aa	DO NOT USE ADVANTAGE UNITL YOU TALK TO A VET!  The chemical used in many flea controls is called Fipronil and is 100 times more toxic to insects than vertebrates. However, it may harm the pups if you give it to them or mom. I am very familiar with Fipronil as it is the same chemical used in Termidor for termite infestations. As an employee of Terminix, I use it regularly and have seen what it can do. Talk to a vet before using any advice here for the pups sake. You can bathe mom with Dawn dish soap without harming the pups and it will work. I do not know if it will harm the pups or not to bathe them.|`|5ad537025866d823160282ebbd0a810eaa	Advantage kills the fleas !!

On parle d'anthropomorphisme quand on attribue des penses humaines aux animaux (style pouvoir de rflexion et d'interrogation sur sa condition, questions mtaphysiques etc.) ou que l'on traite les animaux comme des hommes (cf chienchien  sa mmre)    Aprs, dire que ceci est nfaste pour notre relation avec les animaux, c'est peut-tre exagr, mais ce qui est sur, c'est que dans certains cas, c'est franchement ridicule...|`|2a824cf149c11b84b9506a252a2fde6eaa	Je ne reviens pas sur les bonnes dfinitions de Hobbes ou Sherwood. Je m'attarde avec deux exemples sur les c?ts nfastes que ?a peut amener de ne pas laisser l'animal dans sa condition d'animal. Traiter un animal en animal, ?a ne veut pas dire qu'on ne les aime pas, bien au contraire. Comme dudule l'a crit, ?a peut tre dramatique pour l'humain comme pour l'animal de dvier.  Exemple 1 : tu as un chien qui est un animal de meute, peu importe que ?a soit un berger allemand ou un caniche. Ton foyer est sa meute. Dans une meute il y a trois ou quatre trucs importants : la bouffe, le territoire, la reproduction, la place dans le groupe. Si tu donnes  manger  ton chien avant toi, ?a correspond  la situation o il est le dominant puisque dans les meutes, les plus balaises mangent en premier. Donc mieux vaut le faire manger aprs tout le monde. Le chien est un animal territorial, alors si Mdor ou Kiki ont pris leurs habitudes sur un fauteuil, ?a risque d'tre chaud quand un invit pas mis au courant va se poser sur le fauteuil. Je te laisse imaginer si l'invit en question est un gosse. Personnellement j'ai eu un jour la mauvaise ide de jouer l o tait enterr un os, ?a fait 30 ans je m'en rappelle encore. Le chien qui m'aurait par ailleurs dfendu a ce coup-l vu rouge et m'a jart du lieu  coup de crocs. Alors il vaut mieux que le chien aie son territoire (panier, jouets) et que personne ne s'amuse  lui en contester la possession. La reproduction : seul le chef de meute a une activit sexuelle de reproduction. Alors si Brutus devient insistant avec ta femelle et te conteste de l'approcher, il vaut mieux s'inquiter et lui faire comprendre que c'est toi qui baise. En rsum, si tu laisses se dvelopper des comportement de domination parce que tu ne penses pas en chien dans tes relations avec ton chien, ?a risque de devenir ingrable. Je connais un type qui un jour a pris la dcision de s'enfermer avec son chien dans sa cave et de se battre avec lui jusqu' ce que la hirachie ma?tre-chien soit rtablie. Il avait t trop coulant pendant trop de temps. Tu vois que l'humain peut souffrir de l'anthropomorphisme.  Exemple 2 : l'hyper-attachement chez le chat. Ca se dveloppe entre un chat et son ma?tre lorsque les liens sont trop troits. Parler  son chat et surtout rpondre sont un des lments qui favorisent. Cder  tout ce que Gros Minet veut va y mener aussi. Le chat est extrmement sensible aux changements. Si pour une raison ou une autre tu assouplis le lien en cessant de rpondre  ses solicitations, il risque de faire une grosse dprime. Et les troubles comportementaux dus  la dprime chez un chat c'est trs moche. Il peut devenir trs agressif et ?a peut mener  ce que tu t'en spares. Tu auras fait beaucoup de mal au chat parce que tu en auras trop fait.  Dans une relation avec un animal, c'est l'humain qui devrait savoir se positioner. Celui qui risque d'tre dtruit est toujours l'animal. Lui sera piqu mais on ne te reprocheras pas tes fautes d'apprciation. Alors aimez vos btes mais aimez les bien. Eduquez vous, essayez de comprendre leurs comportements, vous n'en serez que plus heureux car la beaut du monde animal n'a rien  envier  celui des humains.|`|AA10370161	Je suis d'accord avec toi, c'est un vrai scandale et certainement le dernier vrai tabou de notre socit post-industrielle.

If your bathing and changing of the bedding is not working she may be picking them up again outside or they are in your house in other rooms.

Good luck.|`|AA12397723	Adams flea and tick shampoo and frontline for dogs! it is usually around $20+. have you tried that! it is most likely going to work depends on if the fleas are covering her or there is just a lot of fleas. but besides that it mostly works!!!!! and if they are in your house and around it you can try Adams carpet powder and if there in her ears you can try Durvet ear mite repellent lotion. you can find out about that at www.durvet.com. hope that works!!|`|38603831ccf7fc479d6e2e88cc0d2fbaaa	frontline plus works great it doesnt harm her or her babies, you have to put it under her fur once a month, it gets rid of all of them, oh and they wont exactly harm the pups, but they will invade them as soon as they get fur, and if you plan on giving them away, i dont think people want a puupy with a bunch of fleas.|`|d4423f73fa2ed646192758934b5abdb9aa	I am a huge fan of Borax for fleas..  Wash her bedding in the borax laundry soap and sprinkle it around her sleeping area and any carpet/rugs you have in the house.  while the borax is soaking in take your dog and give her a bath with Dawn Dish Soap.  It is gentle on your pregnant pooch and tough on the fleas.   Before you let your dog back out into her area or on the carpet being treated, make sure you vacuum up the borax and toss out the bag, or empty the bagless outside of your house and off your lawn.  When the area is cleaned up, let her back into her area.   But remember that you cannot use most flea meds even after your dog has her babies.. Not until they are done nursing.      To the people who stated using Frontline or similar products on pregnant dogs, I would recommend Stopping.   That is NOT safe, No vet has EVER allowed it, including the one that I work for.  I breed dogs and would NEVER even consider using it on any of my dogs that are pregnant or nursing.|`|bc7491c4271d355793118a1c4c7acb3caa	I don't think you can get rid of her fleas safely without causing harm to her pups.

Will not harm anything.|`|e38589381fb1a85912079b7470ade24aaa	The dog should already be under a vet's care, so go to the vet and ask about alternative treatments.  Get the info straight from the vet on the flea life cycle.     Fleas breed in the carpet and upholstry and outside.  You need to treat your whole house with a flea spray that you get from the vet, and a lawn care product for the front & back yards.  The eggs can lie dormant for up to 4 months and hatch during vibrations, like walking, vacuuming, moving furniture, etc.      You also need to talk to the vet about how to protect the puppies.  They could certainly die if you don't take care of this problem before they're born.  Be prepared to lose a pup or two if you don't get your house and your dog treated properly.    After the pups are old enough (not nursing), make sure you get ALL of the dogs treated with a prevantative like Advantage or Frontline.    It sounds as though you are not a professional breeder.  When the pups are born, please have your dog spayed.  It is irresponsible to allow your dog to breed without proper planning and care, and increases the number of mutts that are put down every year.  It lowers the quality of life for both the mom and the puppies, and puts the mom at higher risk for certain cancers (uterine, mammary, & ovarian).    I can't believe your dog is due so soon and you haven't consulted your vet about this yet.  It's irresponsible.  As a pet owner, it is your responsibility to understand parasite transmission and life cycle.  ESPECIALLY for a breeder, which you now are, like it or not.|`|e0d452be46506578881d3169dbc2273aaa	Have you tried cedar shaving bedding?|`|7e80e8f9365d8d517d246d0158eae101aa	Believe it or not bathe her in salt water use a ton of salt.

Infatti per il primo anno  consigliabile che continui a mangiare anceh di inverno. Dopo per falla andare in letargo altrimenti si stressa troppo e le pu fare male... Come cibo a volta va bene anceh pollo o pesce in alternativa ai gamberetti...in questo modo cresce prima..

Ti mando (qualche) curiosit e notizia su come allevare MAZINGA.. :-)  Qualche curiosit:   - Le tartarughe non sono animaletti sociali, non sentono la mancanza dei loro simili e quindi una tartaruga non soffre  di solitudine;    - Per distinguere il sesso bisogna aspettare i 2 o 3 anni det, i maschi hanno la coda pi lunga e pi grande, e le unghie delle zampe anteriori molto sviluppate; le femmine diventano molto pi grandi.   - Le tartarughe sono animali intelligenti, riconoscono chi si prende cura di loro, ricordano quando  ora di mangiare, sono capaci di dimostrare affetto e si lasciano viziare molto facilmente. Non ci sono limiti, pi impegno si mette nel loro addestramento e pi imparano.   - La vendita delle trachemys scripta elegans (tartarughe dalle orecchie rosse)  vietata; le specie che si trovano nei negozi sono soprattutto trachemys scripta scripta e graptemys.  - Le tartarughe d'acqua dolce hanno bisogno di acqua bassa, non pi alta della loro lunghezza complessiva...  I giovani nei primi anni di crescita sono principalmente carnivori mentre gli adulti sono per lo pi erbivori.  Tale cambiamento avviene nel corso di unestate.  Si pensa che questa diversit alimentare sia dovuta ad un maggiore bisogno di calcio nei primi anni di vita per rinforzare lo scudo in fase di crescita.  Quindi solo i gamberetti essicati non sono la dieta alimentare equilibrata per queste tartarughe.  Andrebbe loro offerto anche altri tipi di mangime. I giovani devono essere nutriti ogni giorno con un giorno a settimana di completo digiuno. Gli adulti vanno alimentati ogni 2-3 giorni.  Lalimentazione di base comprende alborelle a pezzetti, lombrichi, fegato e carne cruda, cibi preparati che si trovano in commercio.  Altri alimenti indicati sono gamberetti crudi e vegetali per gli adulti. Sono Sconsigliati salumi, latticini, pane.  La dieta pu essere completata con integratori vitaminici.  Per ligiene dellanimale  opportuno pulirgli il carapace con uno spazzolino da denti a setole morbide o una spugnetta per togliere eventuali alghe infestanti.    La sfaldazione del guscio  normale se minima, in quanto essendo giovane e crescendo anche il carapace aumenta. Ma con la trasformazione di mucillggine potrebbe essere un probelma anche serio (batteri) o mantenimento scorretto.  - l'acquario deve avere un riscaldatore dacqua la cui temperatura va mantenuta costantemente tra i 25-26C;  - infine mettete un filtro interno per conservare lacqua tersa e pulita (possibilmente l'acqua non deve essere troppo calcare n contenere cloro).|`|9a23c2cbb84423e3df1712e63e21142eaa	per l' inverno ti conviene comprarle una teca (tartarughiera) in vetro possibilmente.... se hai la possibilit di spendere, perch la pi piccola costa almeno 30...|`|0f60e7197717f9764fbf53fb61e9467aaa	GRANDE CUORE!

A dog can get a runny nose and get crusties at the edges. My dogs has sprayed me on occasion. Plus, since most dogs are always rubbing their faces in things like your pillow, couch, crotch, it's just like Kleenex.

2afc135234abbef95f94201e670fd623aa	I've had female rabbits who had babies (called kittens, in case you didn't know) and it's not unusual for a mother to be very protective of her babies soon after birth.  Try to leave her alone with her babies at first, making sure she has plenty of water and food and quiet.  Here is a web site that has basic information about mother and baby rabbit care that may help...good luck and have fun!  http://www.rabbit.org/care/babies.html C...|`|AA12294733	ok first off: it is normal for animals to protect their babies, back off to avoid provoking the attack.  Second: if the babies are on solids she is not nursing anymore, that is why she don't have any milk now  third: start looking for new homes - but do not rehome until at least 8 weeks old. Remember the rabbits are ready to mate as early as 4-6 months, but that is not good for them, so be ready to remove the males to avoid matings.   Grown male rabbits tend to fight, watch out for this and separate them if nessesary  fourth: remember always good quality hay and fresh water available|`|29146e1512f04d84312e0cfb82df8883aa	it means that she is a VERY good mother. rabbits can be very protective if they think that their babies are in danger... but dont try to touch the babies or take them out because the momma rabbit may think that her babies are in trouble and eat them... (scary) leave her alone for a while and only bother her when youre feeding or watering her... give her extra treats and she might trust you a little more :)|`|cc144fc36d76f05aec3878e89290d650aa	she is just doing her work - protecting her children.|`|AA12169383	it is the normal way of them wanting to protect the babies.  Just gradually move your way on in, try petting the mamma first then go to the babies|`|87eebe17d3f4845af2d4c36dd439c222aa	It means leave her alone for awhile. She is protecting her babies|`|86901a2a0e74747499c4c0ad327c0658aa	SHE IS PROTECTING HER BABIES, SHE DOES NOT FULLY TRUST YOU ENOUGH TO HOLD HER YOUNG. WHEN SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE SHE WILL LET YOU|`|74d3b5d5d26cb89076c39e98414d29daaa	She's acting instinctively.  Leave her and the babies alone, make sure the area is quiet and secluded.  Just open her cage to feed her, give her water.  It is ok to start handling the babies when they start coming out of the nest in 2-3 weeks.|`|AA11865981	what you need to do is keep the mother and the babies apart except for feeding time. that way the mother will not get mad at you and attack you. that way you can show her who is boss all over again. so to speak.
