HNnVrvCfaa	Hey there.  I have bipolar disorder (for which I have been receiving treatment for almost 3 years) and was in a relationship with someone with the same disorder (he was untreated and so was I at the time).      I won't say many personal things here about my past relationship because it's an open community but I will try to help to put your mind at rest a little.      Many mental illnesses display themselves in a way which an outsider can view as "selfish behaviour".  Mental illnesses DO manifest themselves in that way because as I'm sure you're away - being in your own head all day when you're feeling like rubbish eats away at you.  It's all you can think about.  EVERYTHING seems to revolve around it.      His behaviour towards you should not be something that you take personally but I would tell you to urge him to seek treatment.  Before I sort treatment I was so close to giving up on life.  I'm not going to pretend that life is all dandy now with medication/counselling but it is 30% better - and when you feel as bad as I used to that is a HUGE benefit.      When I am having a depressed period the last thing I want is to tell someone I love them, I don't want to see them, speak to them, hear that they love me.  I feel useless and pathetic.  Hearing otherwise simply doesn't sink in.  It's annoying! (That isn't to say that you should stop telling him you love him and acting how you do -remember that he is in a relationship with you so during the times that he feels well he clearly loves you too).      I used to get bored easily by the way but when I found "the one" everything changed for me.  I was still far-away emotionally a lot of the time but we had a mutual understanding - we knew that even if we didn't say/show that we loved each other all the time it didn't mean that we didn't.      If you'd like a chat about anything then add me as a friend or something on here - I'm not sure how it works.  If not, no worries, I hope he seeks help.  I know how hard it is to be the ill one and I know how hard it is to be the supporter of an ill person.  You are very brave and you must love him very much.|`|aSWOtchuaa	I don't want to sound harsh, but you need to tell him to get medicated or to get lost.  It is EXTREMELY difficult to live with/love someone who is bipolar.  I know this because I suffer from bipolar disorder and have treated ex's poorly when I was un-medicated.     If you are planning on staying with him, you need to get yourself educated about the disorder.  I have included some links below that you may find useful.  You also need to make sure that you are taking care of yourself.  People tend to forget about their own needs when they are caring for someone else.    It is true that people who suffer from bipolar can be promiscuous when they are not on their meds.  You really need to make sure that you are doing what is good for you.        Best of luck!    http://www.helpguide.org/mental/bipolar_...    http://www.bpso.org/    http://www.heretohelp.bc.ca/publications...|`|Mxq1NQJdaa	I tuned in on this from your post:  "We finally considered ourselves a couple in November...when he suddenly decided he wanted it."  And what did YOU decide?????    I was also wondering how he was diagnosed with bipolar???  Was this professionally diagnosed or self-diagnosed??    You also wrote this:  "someone told me that they tend to blame their problems on those closest to them..."  This could also be related to simple guilt.  And if a person has someone around to blame their problems on, they don't have to take responsibility for them.    I agree with the previous poster in that his problems may well not be related to Bipolar.  Whatever the reason for his treatment toward you, it is up to you whether you stay around for this continual abusive treatment or not.  There are plenty of guys around that can make you feel happy and secure in your relationship.|`|KkSW6EViaa	i know what you're going through, my mum has bipolar & it can be very difficult.  maybe it's time for him to go on medication, talk to him about it & maybe let his doctor or one of his relatives know how bad things are getting  my mum never used to be on medication but she has been for years now & it's amazing how much it helps  just remember this is his illness & with the right help & support he won't always be like this. it's easier to cope with when you learn not to take things too personally. he doesn't mean the things he says & how he treats you, it is his illness.  good luck!    :)|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	he may be bipolar, but his behaviors aren't bipolar, they are passive aggressive and manipulative, even if he were taking meds his behaviors would not change.  Sounds like you have landed a loser, the sooner you realize this and get rid of him the better off you will be.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Bipolar is different for almost everyone.  Sexually indiscretions, over spending are part of it.  Sounds like your guy needs to go on medication and be in therapy.  If you love him, help him get the help he needs. If you don't run fast because it will bring you down.
ItJzrvQ4aa	you should persist and continue.   jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.  try these, they are really good:    Dumbbell Side Bends    http://www.myfit.ca/exercisedatabase/vie...

All of them are boring. However, if you're competitive, you can try playing sports or doing martial arts. You'll get toned overall, not just your belly.    You can also try this thing called Ultrashape. http://www.ultrashapeclinic.com/    I You need to eat right and exercise a bit, but you will get results in three treatments. I had love handles and it got rid of them. They were reduced by 2cm.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|ktCFG0tMaa	Some people resort to dancing, it's fun and it burns the calories. Some woman go extreme and belly dance, which really tightens up your stomach.|`|hrFGKAeraa	Yoga works, and so does Pilates.

I lost 30 pounds, it clearly does work!|`|v6Ehreizaa	No exercise will get rid of stomach fat or love handles.  You have to lower your over-all body fat to get rid of them.  Cut back 500 calories a day for a couple of months and they should retreat.|`|MxMonsbVaa	If you haven't noticed voddy is a very miserable person.She obviously has weight issues,men issues and children issues.She sits around and tries to make everyone feel bad,this lady has some serious issues.  Mysuggestion to you,from a exercise physiologist stand point.I would first keep a food journal,and start walking .In order to get rid of love handles cardio should be a main focus.Start by walking 15 min a day a brisk pace increasing 5-10 a week thereafter til you hit 1 hr.Combined with healthy eating,and exercise should help you in a bout 9-10 months.Success doesn't happen overnight,its a lifestyle decision.Good luck to you!

aqRd8ceiaa	Water is necessary for your body to digest and absorb vitamins and nutrients. It also detoxifies the liver and kidneys, and carries away waste from the body. And when it comes to digestion . . . it's just not happening without water. Fiber alone cannot aid proper digestive function by itself. In fact, without water as its partner, good fiber goes bad, causing constipation and extreme discomfort.<br>  <br>  If you're dehydrated, your blood is literally thicker, and your body has to work much harder to cause it to circulate. As a result, the brain becomes less active, it's hard to concentrate, your body feels fatigued, and you just "poop out." <br>  <br>  Water - The Miracle Worker<br>  <br>  Simple water -- when it's pure and free of contaminants -- is truly a "wonder drug." Without chemicals, additives, or anything unnatural, a steady dose of 8 glasses of water a day (ideally ? your body weight in ounces of water) will:<br>  <br>   Improve Your Energy<br>  <br>   Increase Your Mental and Physical Performance<br>  <br>   Remove Toxins & Waste Products from your body<br>  <br>   Keep Skin Healthy and Glowing<br>  <br>   Help You Lose Weight<br>  <br>   Reduce Headaches and Dizziness<br>  <br>   Allow for proper Digestion<br>  <br>   Help to keep you more Alkaline<br>  <br>   Water is also an important "healing tool" for people with a history of kidney stones. Since water dissolves calcium in the urine, downing at least 8 glasses daily reduces the risk of stone formation. Drinking water is also valuable in preventing urinary tract infections in both men and for women, flushing impurities out of the system.|`|MLGLVCBJaa	Drinking water is so important for good health. Your body is estimated to be about 60 to 70 percent water. Blood is mostly water, and your muscles, lungs, and brain all contain a lot of water. Your body needs water to regulate body temperature and to provide the means for nutrients to travel to all your organs. Water also transports oxygen to your cells, removes waste, and protects your joints and organs.<br>  <br>  You lose water through urination, respiration, and by sweating. If you are very active, you lose more water than if you are sedentary. Diuretics such as caffeine and alcohol result in the need to drink more water because they trick your body into thinking you have more water than we need.  Without enough water the body becomes dehydrated.<br>  <br>  Symptoms of mild dehydration include chronic pains in joints and muscles,lower back pain, constipation and probably most common, headaches.<br>  <br>  Eight large glasses a day is ideal.<br>  |`|SHqF6F6Oaa	Water is necessary for regulation of temperature and chemical balances. It is also crucial for many metabolic processes. <br>  <br>  Having said that water, like everything else, can be overdone. if you start drinking more than about two or three gallons in a day you will flush vital minerals out of your body and you risk causing damage|`|2W9lxbSGaa	Your body is made out of water. It's only right to drink water regularly to keep your body healthy, balanced, and hydrated.|`|EK2sgBuqaa	Are body is mostly made up of water. It keeps us hydrated and flushes out all the toxins in our body.|`|h4H80Vsqaa	It hydrates your organs
j14m6Ptnaa	There's two ways to look at this.<br>  First, if you don't masturbate or have sex, you will eventually have a wet dream which will relieve any congestion.<br>  Second, avoid becoming physically aroused for long periods of time.  When you stay aroused, your body prepares for ejaculation and this is what is causing your achiness. |`|ZzoOl8xYaa	dude just masturbate. seriously, wet dreams are gross...would u really rather wake up covered in your own ***? ew|`|Jtq1NT0Haa	yes that's blue balls. when you become sexually aroused blood Flo's to the penis and balls making them engorged so when the blood leaves you have the feeling of pain there are to wats to fix this Wait it out, this is what you have been doing or you could masturbate.<br>  <br>  the site i post might help.|`|EpWvrL6Yaa	No,there are no other methods of getting past blue balls.It is not good for you,physically or mentally to stop the release after getting so excited.|`|NeR4bsGHaa	nope those are your only two options so choose wisely|`|Cvo6h3Ueaa	There really is no damage to not masturbating, for there are males/females that go their whole life and never masturbate. Masturbation is just for the alleviation of sexual tensions and feelings and for males, it releases the older sperm and Seminal Fluid to make room for the production of newer ones. If you don't masturbate, you're more likely to have a Nocturnal Emission (Wet Dream), but this isn't necessarily so.  The pain and sensitivity in your testicles will go when you release the semen in a Wet Dream, but it depends on when your body needs to release it. If it becomes unbearable, just masturbate once to get rid of the semen and alleviate the pain. Hope this helps.

HqG51f1daa	Hey, having polyps means there is an abnormal growth in the colon, this does not necessarily mean that your mom has cancer or has some form of polyp malignancy. there are many many people who have their polyps removed. however, you may ask "if the polyps are usually benign, why are they being removed?" so the answer to that is that these polyps may become infected and inflamed. (for example, small food grains can be deposited on these polyps and become inflamed over time) this condition is called diverticulitis, and when this happens, these polyps needed to be removed to prevent the trigger to cause worsening of conditions such as cancer. so emma's mom, as of right now, the doctor just wants to prevent worsening or triggering something wrong. hope this makes you feel better. good luck. =)|`|tGVSO9D5aa	It is recommended that everyone over the age of 40 should have a colonoscopy to screen them for colon cancer. This particularly applies to those who have a family history of colon cancer since they have a somewhat higher risk of having colon cancer. The risk is still quite low but if the cancer can be found at an early stage, it is much more likely to be cured by surgery. Some polyps are pre-malignant. If they are not removed, cancers can eventually develop in them. It makes sense to remove any polyps found so that the type and degree of risk can be assessed but most polyps are not cancers. What your mother's doctor has suggested is a sensible precaution but the most likely outcome is a normal colonoscopy after which both she and you can stop worrying about colon cancer.|`|khrJJcBWaa	It's for her own safty.

2sycPf8Daa	Precordial Catch Syndrome (PCS) is the most common cause of recurring chest pain. It is also sometimes known as “a stitch in the side” or “Texidor’s twinge”. It occurs most often in children and teenagers, but does persist into adulthood as well. The pain occurs just under the left nipple, near where you feel the heart beat most strongly on the front of the chest, and comes on very suddenly. <br>  <br>  If you are experiencing PCS, it may be worth a visit to the doctor just to go over the symptoms to be sure that it is not a different condition that could be more serious. Doctors can easily tell the difference between a serious heart condition and Precordial Catch Syndrome just by talking with the patient, and doing a physical examination. <br>  <br>  In the meantime, you can rest assured that your extremely painful, stabbing feeling is completely normal and only a minor inconvenience. And remember, the key to getting rid of the pain quickly is to just work up the courage to take that deep breath, scream in pain, and be done with it. <br>  <br>  Are you having extreme anxiety with the pain or a feeling of “impending doom” Please be sure to call your doctor’s office right away. These could be indications of a more serious and potentially threatening condition. <br>  <br>  Take care as always|`|iJRAZpfhaa	Breast pain is quite normal and is associated with monthly hormonal fluctuations.

Dangerous until you understand it!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hypoglycemia Symptoms<br>  Because epinephrine, one of the hormones that is activated by hypoglycemia, comes from the central nervous system, the majority of early symptoms of hypoglycemia are related to the nervous system. <br>    Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include the following: <br>    Trembling <br>    Clamminess <br>    Palpitations <br>    Anxiety <br>    Sweating <br>    Hunger <br>  <br>    Because the brain is deprived of glucose, a second set of symptoms follows: <br>    Difficulty in thinking <br>    Confusion <br>    Headache <br>    Seizures <br>    Coma <br>    Ultimately, death <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Eating every 4-6 hours is important to prevent hypoglycemia.  <br>  Be adventurous and try something new to liven up your snacks between meals! <br>  Each of the following counts as one starch:<br>  <br>  <br>  One small apple, orange, peach, pear, nectarine, or tangerine<br>  Eight animal crackers<br>  Four medium fresh apricots or seven dried halves<br>  1/2 of a banana rolled with 2-tablespoons Grape Nuts cereal<br>  1 cup cubed cantaloupe<br>  Twelve Bing cherries<br>  Two chocolate mousse bars (Weight Watchers)<br>  1/2 cup chow mein noodles <br>  Two sugar-free fudgesicles<br>  Three gingersnaps<br>  36 Goldfish (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  Three graham crackers (2 1/2-inch square)<br>  1/2 low-fat granola bar<br>  15 grapes<br>  ? cup fruit juice<br>  Five slices melba toast <br>  1 cup skim milk <br>  Three peanut butter sandwich crackers (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  Two small plums<br>  24 oyster crackers<br>  3 cups popcorn (popped by hot air, or low-fat microwave)<br>  1 slice of angel food cake<br>  1 sugar-free pudding snack cup<br>  Three dried pitted prunes<br>  15 fat-free potato or tortilla chips<br>  3/4 ounce pretzels<br>  2 tablespoons raisins<br>  Two rice cakes (4" diameter)<br>  1 regular Jell-o snack cup<br>  Seven Ritz crackers (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  Six saltine crackers <br>  ? cup canned fruit<br>  15 Teddy Grahams (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  Five reduced-fat Triscuits<br>  Six Vanilla Wafers (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  Six Waverly Wafers (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  12 Original Wheat Thins (adds 1 fat serving)<br>  13 Reduced-fat Wheat Thins (adds 1/2 fat serving)<br>  1 cup nonfat fruit-flavored yogurt (sweetened with sugar substitute)<br>  1/2 cup of sherbet or I Can't Believe It's Yogurt or TCBY frozen yogurt|`|fc9493156516552e26f79108d62a603daa	im the same way only i didnt pass put when i had it i just felt sick but i lied to get it over with<br>  <br>  anyway mine also came back normal to low but they said it was ok<br>  but i knew i wasn't feeling ok!<br>  <br>  so i asked around read alot and did all this research (wich is crazy cuz i never do ahha) and i found out from some people that whats the normal for someone can be to low for others and that your body maybe need more so u can feel fine<br>  <br>  what were ur numbers at ?? mine were in the mid to low 70's and i herd 80 is also normal and under is low <br>  <br>  so it really depends on the person<br>  <br>  carry a snack with u at all times thats what i do and been pretty good since :D
IMPvzBk1aa	It is as dangerous as your limits of knowledge and proper equipment make it.  If you are well informed on maintaining aseptic technique, possess the necessary equipment, and know the anatomy of the tissues, then it will be less dangerous.  If you attempt to do it without that knowledge and equipment, you risk infection, tissue trauma, and excessive bleeding.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	If you get an infection there, not only will it swell and look bad, it may actually scar.<br>  <br>  It is painful and must be done properly to avoid this.<br>  Get it done in a shop. It is VERY EASY to screw this up, and wind up really unhappy.<br>  <br>  I have seen a LOT of bad piercings and you DON'T want one.|`|CoZEYty2aa	I pierced my own lip last month and nothing major happened so i say just stick a needle thourgh and then an earing.  It doesnt hurt that bad.  Just be careful to do it in the right spot|`|qeBH7ySMaa	Not very. Just put the needle in a flame before you do it, and keep it clean. You shouldn't have any problem.|`|OL4DjdOJaa	it is horrible my friends cousin sisters best friends dads girlfriends daughter did it and it got so bad they had to cut off her lips.|`|MRtX1L2faa	very dangerous
YQ9YXcEkaa	It is possible to have relapsed and not have any symptoms, but probably not very likely.  A study in Britain showed that relapse of Hodgkin's disease after treatment is usually detected as a result of the investigation of symptoms rather than by routine screening of asymptomatic patients.  80% of the patients who relapsed had symptoms.  The most common symptoms at relapse were a lump, cough, night sweats, or weight loss.  The scan probably caught the other 20% of relapses before the disease had gone far enough to produce actual symptoms.<br>  <br>  Depending on your stage, your risk of relapse is probably fairly low.  Not having any symptoms is also good.  Given that you finished chemo in December 2005 and haven't experienced any symptoms, it is likely you're cured.  Most Hodgkin's Disease relapses happen within the first 18 months following the completion of chemotherapy.<br>  <br>  If you're concerned, of course, you should call your oncologist.  Here is a link to the study I referenced:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/314/7077/343/a" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/314/...</a>
mINKANlAaa	it sounds like your eye just got hit and its trying to recover. if the hit was hard enough, your eye is just a little punctured right now..give it a night and see how it feels when you get up in the morning. hopefully you will be back to normal, but if your eye is still irritated, you might want to consider paying an eye doctor a visit to get it checked out. dont freak out about this though, you will be fine! just keep an eye on it (no pun intended..) <br>  best wishes :)

If she likes you she shouldn't have to stoop to the all time low of acting like a prostitute. talk to her her about it and if she unwilling to accept the fact that you don't like it when she does that then she isn't really worth being friends with.|`|B17c67APaa	Touchy issue... I'd first ask her to stop, and then ask her what she is doing.  If she likes you (which she probably does), tell her how you honestly feel about her actions.  If you are uncomfortable with what she did, tell her and see if she stops.  If she does and does not do that again, she is a good friend.  If she doesn't, then maybe I'd suggest you find another friend.  On the other hand, if she just wants to kiss you and you are OK with that (assuming she does not have a boyfriend or anything), go ahead.  Again its ultimately up to you.  Hope this helps you in your decision making!|`|BuhZWTiqaa	if you need someone to tell you the answer you deserve a backhand|`|gXwHJUx3aa	tell her you dont lyke her that way|`|kN0eajwbaa	Get in there my son!|`|OWVTPXx8aa	what's wrong with that? return the favor.
7CTvtek0aa	No.  Most over the counter sleeping medication is simply diphenhydramine under a lot of different trade names most popularly known as Benadryl.  I would try the off brand of Benadryl (it is cheaper) 50 mg 30 min before bedtime.  Also there is an herbal supplement called Vallerian root that some people swear by, you can get that at GNC or order it online.
40zewEkMaa	Your thinking is way too complicated.<br>  And no, chances that the infection on your shirt (if it's there at all) is unlikely to spread if you touch it.|`|MIx1fSbdaa	Keep in mind that yeast are an ever-present organism. It's in the environment, used to make bread and beer and lots of other things. When in a hostile environment they form spores and can live for ages. And any chain of contact can spread them. Yes, you probably can pass the cells through the rim of your shirt. However, my understanding is that yeast infections depend on the pH of "down there" as well as other factors. If you get over the infection, your personal environment is probably better balanced, so the yeast aren't able to attach and proliferate. I think that because otherwise we'd get infections all the time. I've heard that yogurt helps, by the way.|`|XNfWsUZaaa	No. I just answered on of your other questions about itchiness down there.<br>  If it comes in contact with air, then its ok. It will die. Bacteria need a warm, damp and dark enviroment to thrive. Only hardy strains are able to survive.

Just eat a healthy balanced diet and you will fill out proportionately. <br>  <br>  I'd advise eating less meats, more vegetable proteins such as beans, brown rice, WHOLE grain bread, oatmeal, real peanut butter with no ingredients other than peanut, NO FRIED FOODS, NO TRANS FATS, NO PROCESSED FOODS, eat lots of fiber and proteins.<br>  <br>  Mainly whole grains, avoid animal derived foods like cheese, milk, yogurt, eggs and meat. <br>  <br>  I'd say eating salmon and other lean meat fishes would be advisable.

7k8iwvvOaa	Do you know how Splenda was discovered?<br>  <br>  It was discovered by accident.  Research was actually being performed to create an insecticide.  Scary huh.  There are many side effects blamed on Splenda by critics.  I think its just disturbing to know they were making an insecticide and thought oh wait, we can use this as an artificial sweetener.  <br>  <br>  I guess all artificial sweeteners are bad in their own way.  I wrote an article recently on the 5 FDA approved artificial sweeteners.  If your interested, check it out.<br>  <br>  Artificial Sweeteners Could Be Hidden in Your Foods and Medications<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1489356/artificial_sweeteners_could_be_hidden.html?cat=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|qEy34ueZaa	Instead of answering your question, which I can not, I will give you two facts: my wife uses it, and it does not seem to bother her, well, apparently! Myself and my daugther-in-law both experienced mouth sores while using it. We stopped, and the sores went away. It does not mean it is bad, only it is basically a personal decision.<br>  Remarks: I believe it is used in Coke Zero. The other pink and blue stuff, used to carry warnings right on the package. Sugar itself, so called "natural" (crystals/white) is a processed product. After I have been recommended to use unprocessed sugar (brownish), and a bit confused, I have made the decision of eliminating sweeteners in my coffee, became used to it, and now enjoy the coffee's full flavor. It is basically up to you, since everyone giving you advice is  impersonating a doctor.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Yes, your better off with stevia or agave nectar<br>  <a href="http://www.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.charleslloydfitness.com</a><br>  <a href="http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com</a>|`|FvMtam2Aaa	You should google that.

Wj1TU2ZGaa	Yes they do carry Plan B, it usually runs about $40. It's only effective if it has been 72 hours or less since you had sex. It merely prevents implentation of the egg. I'm not sure about the age requirements, but I do know due to HIPPA you have to pick it up yourself. Also, a lot of pharmacies now supply Plan-B as an OTC medication. Good Luck.|`|AA11315244	I left you a link from the planned parenthood website that should be of great assistance for you! Good luck!|`|1KqknaUHaa	Yeah you have to be 18 and yeah they have it.<br>  I'm not sure but your boyfriend MIGHT be able to get it if he's 18, but I'm not sure about that.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	It ranges from fifty to seventy dollars in my state. You have to be over 18. I believe your boyfriend can get it for you. You make go in, they write a prescription. You pick it up at the pharmacy. Simple as that.|`|TCFX0S5oaa	You have to be 18, a boy can get it, planned parenthood has it and I think you can be under 18 to get it there. it is around $50. it is availale at CVS, walgreens, and every drug store if you have a friend that is 18 or over to get it for you. otherwise planned parenthood is your best bet.
kN0eajwbaa	I love your question title btw!<br>  The clitoris is above the 'flaps' and is that little bump.<br>  If you rub it you'll feel something because even when you use a flannel to wash you feel something there.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Chances are if you THINK you found your clit... you haven't actually found it. It is a supersensitive sex organ that is hidden underneath folds of skin on your vagina. I suggest googling up some human female anatomy to properly locate it.<br>  <br>  If you just aren't in 'the mood' then that is fine too... every body is different and gets turned on by different things..perhaps you should try  rubbing yourself with a layer or two of clothing on, as direct stimulation can be to much and not all that pleasurable...|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Do a Google image search for clitoris if you're not quite sure, they'll have diagrams to show you where. You can also buy muscle vibrators at department stores (Walmart, Target, Ulta, Bed Bath and Beyond, etc) and they will function as well as an adult vibrator. Just try to relax and find what you like instead of focusing on what you think you're supposed to be doing.|`|rbQ4UCk8aa	your clit is the flap of skin near the top of your vagina, it is easily identifiable, and you have various days where you aren't as hormonal and might not be turned on as easily.

3PqM91NJaa	After having my period for a few years, I used to get hit with new symptoms all the time. You should be fine. Just try to get yourself up. Exercise actually helps! You can't be too tired.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, try not to make yourself feel tired. If you sit there in that state of mind, you'll stay in it. Sometimes it's all in your head.|`|3Y6E2EmMaa	It could be your period. I sometimes get like that but it could just be that you aren't getting enough sleep.

If you have questions you can always consult your doctor.  Your reaction or symptoms to your period can change over time.  Many girls experience different reactions throughout their life.  Sometimes you may have strong cramps while other times you barely feel anything.  The best thing to do is take an advil or two and try to relax.  Wear comfy clothes and shoes and use heat.  Hot baths or heating blankets.|`|VjMyHAWraa	Most doctors will suggest an iron supplement for woman (or girls) once they have started their period.

I'm sure you can try doing stuff like that in the park, or taking a walk/jog/run with your dogs (depending on your fitness level)|`|5JquTFE9aa	700 calories ?????

W6LGsQC8aa	Not at all!<br>  <br>  Having sex can actually alleviate cramps and PMS symptoms!<br>  <br>  As long as your partner is mature enough to accept that there will be blood involved, either lay a towel down (preferably a dark color towel) or try in the shower. But DO NOT do it in a tub, that can force water into your vagina and cause injury!<br>  <br>  Regardless of the time of month, if you do not use protection you can get pregnant. EVEN when on your period! ALWAYS use protection!|`|velIdcbNaa	Actually you can get pregnant during and right after your period.  It all depends on whether you still have your egg inside of you or not.  I've heard of women getting pregnant a week after their period.  I would get the month test to see when you are lest likely to get pregnant or when you are able to.  Use protection too. <br>  <br>  Most guys dont like to do it during that time anyways.|`|o6uwV66jaa	I was told that if you have sex while on your period that you have a BETTER chance of getting preggerzz..<br>  <br>  check out google..|`|brSfRLspaa	<a href="http://www.babychoice.com/Other%20Information/Ways%20to%20Chart%20Your%20Fertility%20Pattern_fichiers/MenstrualChart07.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.babychoice.com/Other%20Inform...</a><br>  <br>  shower is the best place for it, standup doggystyle ;)|`|GPNF7Ds7aa	well there is still a chance of pregnancy if you have your period and dont use a condom.

08Vk3RtJaa	Why did your bf mom kick him out?  What was the argument with your dad about?  Try to be a bit objective and think about what part your bf played in these problems.  You can't just blame everyone else.<br>  Believe me I understand you heart is breaking, but you will not die.  Slowly, slowly you will get over this boy, or perhaps the problems will resolve themselves and you may be able to see him again, either way try to stay positive and tell yourself that things will improve. You will cry for a while but that will ease and so will the pain, but this will take time, so just hang in there.<br>  <br>  P.s.Just found a couple of your old questions... is this the same boyfriend who you wrote about a little while ago, the one who goes out at 1.30 in the morning without telling you and that you fight with everyday?  And it this the same mom that is really sick and you want to put in a nursing home??  Dump the boyfriend and try giving your parents a bit of respect|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	aww... honey.... this sounds... complicated. i really dont know what to tell you, but this sounds like an awful combination of problems... and the only way to deal with it is to GET THRU IT alive.... thoughts of death are to be ignored. because after all, if its this bad, it can only get better, and doesnt it kind of seem like a waste that you went thru the crappy part and would miss the better parts if you died??|`|VfA3OoU9aa	wow that really is awful.  Its sooo hard to go through something like that all by yourself.  Especially when you have gone through so much already.  suicide will not fix any of your problems or any one elses....soooo forget that!  How do you think your boyfriend would feel to know that you killed yourself because you could not talk to him.  just hang in there for the time being.  you will see him again.  give it time.  Like you said.....you have been through too much for a regular 16 year old.  I am sure you can make it through this.  you will see him again.|`|asHMJqlDaa	I don't really know what I could say that would help you out, but I really really don't think that you should commit suicide over that. I think that you should calm down, and think this through, and just try to come up with a reasonable solution. alright?|`|P3ADxqJlaa	go c a counsler. they can really help you out. Or try to sneak out of the house and go c him....but dont commit suicide...its the worst thing ever.|`|knFDrJ4Taa	All I can tell you is that suicide is not the answer. If you do something to yourself, you're not helping anything or anyone. The problems with your boyfriend and family would still go on, and get a thousand times worse because of the grief they will feel. You can't do that to your boyfriend or your parents. And, well, if you end your life, you'll never get to see your boyfriend again. You'll never see this problem resolved. You'll be denying yourself your happiness. Just wait it out. See what happens. An opportunity will present itself to you, and all you need to do is act on the right thing. Whether it's talking to your dad or going out to find your boyfriend, any option is better than suicide. I'm sure everything is going to work out; things could easily move in your favor, I'm sure of it. Just keep on going. Take your mind off of all this for a while. It should help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck :)
4onT0qUxaa	Fibromyalgia, also called myofascial pain syndrome, as well as chronic widespread pain syndrome is a chronic pain condition with varying degrees of severity. It is characterized by trigger points which become very sensitive and cause pain for what seems like no reason. It can include everything from joint pains, headaches, muscle pain and spasms, as well as chronic fatigue. When Dr's are not sure what is causing the pain and have found no other explanation for it (such as arthritis), and the pain persists for a minimum of 6 months, and trigger points can be identified, this will usually be the diagnosis. You will have to see a Rheumatologist to confirm this diagnosis based solely on symptoms, as there is no clinical tests to confirm it. Although it is a chronic problem that is not likely to go away completely, there will be periods of improvement and "flare-ups" as they are called. It is managable with anti-inflammatory medications as well as massage therapy, trigger point injections and alternative treatments such as acupuncture. Your best bet is to avoid the things that cause the flare-ups to begin with, such as in my case it is cold. As soon as I get a chill, my muscles set off into muscle spasms and my joints start aching. Good luck!|`|PnlgLBcwaa	Fibromyalgia (FMS) is NOT also called Myofascial Pain Syndrome--they are 2 differnt conditions<br>  <br>  fibromyalgia has tender points--not trigger points like myofascial<br>  <br>  Fibrofix is QUACKERY--FMS is NOT a liver problem, body acid, thick body fluids...that person was misdiagnosed<br>  <br>  <br>  Real FMS is a neurological disorder<br>  <br>  many docs do use teh FMS label for any pain--which is malpractice<br>  <br>  it is rough, it is NOT fatal, there are no good treatments for REAL FMS--the only people that have been cured-never had real fms--they ahd something else<br>  <br>  there are a few promising treatments-savella, cymbalta, lyrica<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  there is no inflammation-NSAIDS and msucle relaxants and narcotics ahve minimal efffect<br>  <br>  <br>  while rheumatologist are teh specialist of record--it is now known taht it is NOT a rheumatologuical disorder--other specialists are paying attention and might help|`|9c602a89600531b7e92ac1d7eaccc1ffaa	Symptoms with Descriptions on www.FibroFix.com  should be helpful.<br>  <br>  All free site.

Y4s4Om38aa	It is pretty tall for a girl, but model tall, not freekishly tall (models are usually around 5'9")......but most girls will hit their final height around your age, so you may likely be done growing at this point.  Boys usually sprout up a bit later.  So most girls will likely not get to be as tall as you (and most will wish they could), but boys will catch up in the next few years.  It will just be awkward in the mean time|`|xzMkUCizaa	Depends on your genes..My father is 5'5 my mother 5'4 and I am 5'2 :( my son is 2 and already he is as tall as a 4 year old (his father is 6'9)<br>  but mainly it is that everyone is short and you are the only "normal" one :D<br>  My cousin is 13 and she is 6'2!! She always tells me if I am ever going to catch up to her|`|psvFWDN8aa	I'm 22 and 5'11''.. You're lucky, you can become a model with that height. When I was 14, I was around your height too, and so I tried modelling, and I loved it. Now I book a ton of modelling shows... you should try it, too...

t2R3mEMoaa	Congrats on having a baby. Did your doctor tell you it was safe to take prozac during pregnancy and if so look it up again on the computer regarding side affects, just to be safe? You are to close to giving birth to take the risk now. Most women go through many different emotions while pregnant and hopefully this is all it may be. Prozac put me into a deeper depression but everyone is different. If you have to take these meds then make sure you have the safest one on the market for you and for your baby. Hope everything works out well for all of you and always listen to your intuitive self.|`|sZOiNdD5aa	i don't want to discourage with PROZAC, i take that medication before but it i feel more depress due to side effects, until i found VILIFT it's all naturals and it really helps me a lot.
c55O7jqXaa	Since your nose, throat and ears and all connected it is understandable that would be having both. <br>  <br>  For the sore throat I suggest gargling with salt water as warm as you can stand it and also honey and lemon in hot water help or tea. Sucking on zinc cough drops help keep the throat moist and keeps it from getting as scratchy. Also putting vicks vapor rub on the outside of your neck, near your nostrils will help soothe the pain too. <br>  <br>  Ok for the ears. Any kindof oil or olive oil heated up and put into the ear along with cotton will help. <br>  <br>  Natural antibiotic that is completely safe for both your throat and ears and even nose is Colloidal Silver. It is nice because it is all natural and can be used internally and externally and no you aren't going to turn blue. Those are only cases of dorks that have made their own and have been drinking it by the gallon for years. Dork nuggets. The kind you get at the natual store you are using very little.|`|7CTvtek0aa	Try hot tea and advil, always works for me.  You probably don't need to go to the doctor right now anyway because at this point they would probably just send you home and tell you to drink plenty of fluids because it may be viral.  If it doesn't go away on it's own in a week or gets a lot worse, then I would go see a doctor because it may be bacterial and then you may need some antibiotics to get over it.|`|lxrQyQ5raa	No, unfortunately you really need to see the doctor.  I didn't have health insurance for nine months so i know how hard financially this can be.  But you most likely need an antibiotic.  For now gargle with warm salt water for your throat and take extra strength tylenol.  But If it all started on Monday it's been going on for some time and probably isn't going to just go away.  And ear infections can get really bad.  I get them a lot.  They are no fun.  Try a heating pad for the ear until you can see a doctor.|`|08eSVjLXaa	for a sore throat usually warm salt water will do the trick ..just by gargling it for a few minutes.  <br>  <br>  For ear aches...they say sweet tree oil warmed up.. drops in the ear or places like wal-mart have homeopathic ear drops..|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	for the ear ache.Do you have any sweet oil? Warm up the sweet oil before you  Put a sm amount in your ear and let it drain in the ear canal.<br>  <br>  For the sore throat gargle in warm salt water.Drinking warm chicken broth will ease the pain.

CHQqhz7baa	It is a big myth like the other guy said. Our bodies are much more complicated than that. Each time you eat a different food group, a macronutrient such as a carb, protein or fat, different hormones are released into circulation. It is these hormones along with other hormones that determines how much weight you store and how much you burn. Even the fat that you eat has to be turned into the fat that is stored. This is the same for protein and especially carbohydrates. <br>  <br>  They say that carbs and protein contain 4 cals for every gram and that fat contains 9 cals. You can eat twice as much carbs and protein than fat to feel full and satisfied. Carbohydrates are mainly used for fueling the nervous system including the brain and for quick release energy. This is it's only real function. The majority of functions in the body require fatty acids as their fuel source especially the muscles including the HEART!! So 9 calories from fat is used solely as fuel whereas ANY left over carbohydrate or glucose needs to be burned or it will turn into fat. <br>  <br>  Any person that adds more fat, yes staurated fat to their diet will find that they are fuller for longer and eat much less food throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Without fat in the diet you CANNOT absorb most of the vitamins and minerals that you get from food. Each one of these nutrients play a role in maintaining metabolism and a healthy weight. Good luck.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	yes, calories are the energy your body uses in a day so if you eat more than you burn your body stores them (as fat).  there is no rule for how much more you have to burn, but an average of 500 calories more burned a day than eaten equates 1 lb of weight loss a week.  if you are already a helathy BMI however, it would be terribly unhealthy to lose 15-20 lbs, if you don't like how you look i suggest talking to a counselor (also about the suicidaiility) and maybe lifting some weights to tone your muscles rather than lose an unhealthy amount of weight<br>  <br>  PS no one's perfect...and it it helps my superhot firefighter boyfriend loves me for my flaws, more than for my "perfections".|`|T4uZeVXjaa	If your BMI is healthy, then you don't need to lose 15 pounds.<br>  <br>  Please see a therapist or your family doctor to talk about why you are so miserable and unhappy with your appearance.  This is a mental health issue, not a diet issue.|`|wwRbkCMraa	simple math would say so... but you never know for sure... have you checked out that HCG diet?? here is a little snippet I found on it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?topic=103.0" rel="nofollow">http://buybulkwhey.com/forum/index.php?t...</a>|`|MF9YknDYaa	No,it's a big myth.It should work but weight loss is so complected.We are not machines.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	I managed to drop 15 pounds in just under 2 months by cutting out all junk food, all fried foods and all soda. I walked 20 minutes each day (basically to the park, around it and then home), which helped a lot.<br>  <br>  Even healthy food has calories. The more you take in the more you have to burn off to reach a target goal. The BIG trick is to not feel hungry. They recommend breaking things up into many small meals and not to sit down to anything big like a large supper.  And NO food 6 hours before bedtime.  <br>  <br>  I agree with the 1800 calories a day, that's a good figure.  Stick with raw veggies and fruits for snacks, yogurt, fruit juice and a lot of water.  No mayo or dressings (I like red wine vinegar, so that wasn't a problem for me).  Eat some nuts, but not a lot. Almonds are the best choice as they help the skin. Don't do peanuts.<br>  <br>  The whole thing is to get yourself moving.  Try a mall walk one day, a hike another day, anything that runs at least 20 minutes.  Or run a half block, walk a block, jog a half block.  It does do changes.  Slowly, but it does do them.<br>  <br>  Nobody is perfect. Really. Having that as a target is fairly unreasonable. What you aim at is to feel good, to look nicer, and to be happy with the fact there's changes being made.  Don't hold that 'perfect' label out there for you to reach because it's never attainable. But it IS attainable to get yourself looking better than you do now, so strive for that.|`|bOhvvbUIaa	To lose weight you need to eat healthy and exercise, dieting just wont cut it. don't be suicidal please im sure you look beautiful
vdrS4QCLaa	It could be multiple things depending on where on the right side it is.<br>  It could be ovulation, your temperature rises at this time, and if you have endometriosis it can become quite painful.<br>  It could be appendicitis, but you are right it should have been caught by now.  <br>  It could be gallbladder pain.  I had similar pain on my upper right side, but was told everything was fine with my gallbladder, I finally realized it only happened when I took calcium carbonate (very basic, is both a calcium supplement and tums).  Since I switched to calcium citrate the pain has one away.  This is probably a rare cause and should ask a doctor to check your gallbladder function.|`|WqCWWOVhaa	the docs r probably over looking something simple are u sure u don't need your appendicitis removed? ive heard those are kind of the symptoms. <br>  <br>  or id try going to a different doctor if you've ever watched the show 'mystery diagnosis'  they have a lot of problems and none of their doctors can figure it out so they go to a different doctor.|`|OltxntiPaa	it sounds like appendicitis to me; have they checked you for that? about a month ago i also had severe pains in my right lower abdomin and they said it did not appear to be appendicitis but to watch for a fever and pain traveling towards the belly button, both of which you have. also i had a little limp for the rest of the night and they said i may have had an ovarian cyst that ruptured, so they should probably check for those too. hope this helps.|`|oEF46EZRaa	Does it hurt all the time or just sometimes?  Have the checked your gall bladder?  It could also be burst ovarian cysts which are painful also.<br>  <br>  I had my gall bladder removed because of similar pain.|`|2RE4TVx8aa	you might want to get more tests done and maybe u should check into a hospital it could be your appendix or i hate to say it but a tumor u need to get more tests done|`|JF73mc81aa	There must be something wrong with your right kidney..|`|FNdsPNrJaa	I would say its your Gallbladder! Get it checked out immediately! The pain may not be in the exact spot however, it tends to pulsate to other areas. I can't think of what else it might be :/ I had to have mine out last year and the pain was similar..Good Luck !

2zgv89OQaa	This is such a great question.  Every woman or young teen needs to know this.<br>  <br>  The risk of TSS can be greatly reduced by following the recommended tampon guidelines:<br>  <br>  . Avoid super absorbent tampons.<br>  <br>  . Alternate the use of tampons with sanitary napkins or mini-pads during your period. <br>  <br>  . NEVER LEAVE A TAMPON INSERTED OVERNIGHT.<br>  <br>  . Change tampons frequently, at least every 4-6 hours.|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	Yea you can, don't worry.<br>  <br>  Just change it when you wake up and you'll be just fine.|`|N89HLv92aa	Its ok to sleep with one in. Dont worry about it. If it bothers you just set your alarm to wake you up in like 4 hrs. to go to the bathroom and change it.  But I always used one over night and i never got it. I dont hear of it happening much. Just dont leave one in for like 24hrs. or anything...thats kinda gross anyway.|`|AA10358331	Yes, but i wouldn't. <br>  It says that you can wear it up to 8 hours, but its more safe to wear it for 5-6 hours. Plus if you are sleep you never know if it will leak. Personally for me, its just easier to wear a pad when I sleep.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	yes you can|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	as long as its in your vagina and not 1 in your mouth and 1 in each nostril.|`|brSfRLspaa	who sleeps more than 8 hours? yeah you can just wake up at least once and change it, but I usualy sleep about 7.5 hours, I always sleep with a tampon,  it's real easy for pads to leak when you're sleeping, especially out your butt crack :/|`|C4WlEbIOaa	Yes you can do that.  If your flow is heavy, use like the super or super plus.  TSS usually a result of leaving your tampon in after it is all full or if you leave in in for like a whole day.|`|wa2Am5m2aa	yep! i always sleep with a tampon because pads are grose and it never stays on the pad haha. btw TSS is very rare, the only time you should be worried about it is if its in for 12+hours. otherwise youre good!!|`|doHNEvf8aa	no! you shouldnt go for more then 8 hours with a tampon in. just get overnight pads if your worried about leaking|`|ef7tAoYsaa	Girls have slept with me when they're in.  They're are eventually taken out, but they start in.|`|FK27EfOWaa	You can, but personally I wouldn't.|`|ObnYA9lxaa	please explain what you mean by "in"|`|vqsfiJgTaa	you ll bee fine! please help mee!|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Well, the longer you leave it in the more at risk you are to get TSS. There's no specific amount of time you have to leave a tampon in to get it, it can come on very quickly (within hours) for some women. You should familiarize yourself with the symptoms so you can recognize it if it does come on. If you feel uncomfortable, get some pads for night time. It is a rare condition though so don't lose sleep about it.|`|rhuhp6KCaa	you shouldnt sleep with a tampon on unless your gonna get up every 4-6 hours to change it, its very unhealthy to go for longer. after 4-6 hours anything can happen especially if your not a light sleeper. just wear a super long pad and you should be fine. some doctors say its better to sleep without a tampon because it allows your body to breathe better.  daytime...sure but not at night for over 4 hours.|`|g1coKXlHaa	no you shouldn't, you can get Toxic shock syndrome. the max amount of time a tampon should be in is 3 hours, so unless you plan to get up every three hours i would use a pad at night and a tampon during the day. prevention is better than cure.|`|URS0xvjTaa	It's safer if you don't. I know it's annoying, but if you want to sleep with one you should get up in the middle of the night to change it. Otherwise, get one of those overnight pads and hope that it doesn't leak through.|`|aM5FTVvXaa	i would never do that. it tells you usually on the tampon box how often to change them. so go according to that. and if you sleep longer than the recommended time frame for taking the tampon out, just sleep with a pad only at night.|`|RR1zU5Zwaa	Yes, of course you can--Use a fresh one at night before bedtime and make sure you change first thing in the morning.|`|3pr75r2caa	Yes, but you'll need to wake up in 8 hours to replace it with a new one.|`|wcWTwFFpaa	You can but be sure you use the absorbency that u need and not like a plus for a light period|`|YQLIEh0Saa	Yes. There is no link found between tampons and TSS. Most of the materials thought to be contibuted in tampons are now not used in their making.|`|QcUxOUnqaa	yes you can|`|km6rtHPpaa	NO >>> NEVER LEAVE A TAMPON OVERNIGHT…. THERE ARE OVERNIGHT PADS FOR THAT PURPOSE!!!!!!|`|NNtUndVQaa	Yea, you can sleep with it in. You'll be fine.
tIldpr7vaa	no not prime<br>  <br>  go jogging, walking is better than nothing, but jogging is much better for losing fat than walking ( burns many more calories )<br>  <br>  1/2 hour of jogging is better than 2 hours of walking|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	if that is all you're eating, that's why your having issues.<br>  <br>  You need to eat at least 1200 calories a day, and get plenty of exercise. When you don't eat, your metabolism slows, and you stop losing weight.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.
vsDbgfp1aa	First things first- Tooth aches mean infection-Clove oil or painkillers are a temp relief- If you cannot find clove oil take a 3 cloves( can buy them at any supermarket) and powder it and  put a pinch of it where it hurst_ It will numb the place but the  tooth ache will return Go to a dentist and let him attend to it before it gets worse
TORBP6QIaa	IF that reading is accurate...and I wouldnt be surprised if it wasn't...your BP is too high...BUT...to get a proper reliable reading you should go to the doctors or even one of those stalls you sometimes see with a heart foundation nurse taking blood pressure readings.  If you go to either of these you will soon realise they have you sit quietly for a few minutes before they take the reading...this allows your BP to settle.<br>  <br>  Now...I am sure you know your diet is terrible...the lack of vegetables in a young lady is surprising...often its guys who live on that fast food rubbish.  You need some good food to nourish your body so change your habits and learn to cook...even home-made versions of your favourite fast food is a better choice.<br>  <br>  Cholesterol level is yet another thing...I would hate to guess what yours would be since you dont eat vegies.  Make some room in your life to change this and I am sure you will feel a lot better too. <br>  <br>  I think you should see the doc.,  get your BP read properly and have a cholesterol test so you can see where you are at.|`|BbM3WjCMaa	We can't tell about your cholesterol intake, we'd have to see your whole diet, but 1. you really shouldn't have cholesterol problems at that age, 2. it can be genetic too, my grandfather ate really healthy homemade vegetables his entire life and still has problems with cholesterol. <br>  <br>  That's a pretty high number. Normal is 90-120, although 90 and 120 are considered low/high ends. I know I feel horrible when mine's spikes to around 130, and that's during exercise or something. Yeah, you should go see a doctor, your GP who will probably refer you to a cardiologist if he doesn't fix the issue. <br>  <br>  Sodium makes our blood pressure go up. Do you eat a lot of salt? Do you drink enough? Cutting out the salt and drinking plain water all day should lower the number.|`|xt6bhqDPaa	Hi there, <br>  Salt and sodium are commonly blamed for raising blood pressure so you want to look for foods that are low in sodium. Stay away from salty chips, use low sodium soy sauce when cooking and check the nutrition information before you pick up your favorite jar of tomato.(TIP: If possible always buy fresh or frozen vegetables and fruits and avoid stuff that comes in a can because it's packed with salt).<br>  If you're eating a lot of junk food, that may be a cause of the high blood pressure (lots of salt). <br>  The fat from the junk food may be causing problems too.<br>  If you're looking for a recipe/diet plan to guarantee long term lower blood pressure, there's a great blog post below about a non-medical approach (all natural) to lowering blood pressure...<br>  Either way, good luck! <br>  Here's the link:<br>  <a href="http://quicklylowerhighbloodpressure.com" rel="nofollow">http://quicklylowerhighbloodpressure.com</a><br>  ?|`|AA11315244	Yes, you have hypertension.

I lost thrity pounds, it clearly does work!|`|bSqM0uYGaa	Easy answer, it's the fiber and the vitamins in the food you're eating. It's VERY healthy but when your body digests it, it produces gas. It's normal, should go away when your body gets used to it. If not, just take gas-x or something like that.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	when you add more fiber in a very fast pace, it gives you a ton of gas. cut back on your fiber(such as the broccoli), and add it more gradually.
vsDbgfp1aa	The fact that you have to get a root canal procedure done means your dentist has seen  that the tooth is fairly strong and to save it instead of pulling it out means the basic bone under is good-So he will fix the cavity and then he has to remove the nerve ( this is why you are feeling the sensitivity & pain) once he manages to remove the nerve, the tooth is as good as a dead one YEt you can use it for light chewing<br>  what he will do in the first sitting( from experience I have had) is to give you a numb shot, then drill the tooth to expose the cavity and then remove the nerve- He will then do a temp. filling, ask you to come for a second visit, and then complete it with a permanent filling<br>  Before all this he will take an X-ray<br>  There is No  alternate solution except pulling out the offending tooth<br>  Massaging the gums, Vitamin C for countering acting infection, and  basic mouth hygiene.|`|c395f9b923e5867e12ec729455cee920aa	ugh im going to have that done as well. ive done some research and have found out that the cavity is in too deep & he has to kill the nerve. so when you go to the dentist he is gonna kill the nerve by drilling it. the tooth is gonna practically be dead but you can use it to eat soft foods & wont have to take it out. he/she will later give you a permanent filling. <br>  <br>  this is an overview of what is gonna be done: <a href="http://www.implantmaster.com/root%20canal_banner.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.implantmaster.com/root%20cana...</a><br>  <br>  please answer mine: <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/indexqid=20090220202622AAYDf5k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/indexq...</a>|`|ObaHP6wnaa	The pain can't come back after a root canal, if that tooth was truly the source of the pain.  The tooth is completely dead.  My dentist was very particular and did several follow-ups to the root canal, including inserting a metal post into the hole to help strengthen the tooth (I was 21 years old, so it needs to last a long time).  At the follow-up appointments, I don't think I even needed novocaine.  The tooth felt nothing, even when instruments were shoved up into my tooth.|`|7ZqoeWqDaa	I know when I had my root canal, when the pain stopped, that ment the root was dead.

v2HWSwc8aa	hi avi, I am a female crohn's pt. like yourself dxed at a very young age.  <br>  <br>  If you check out the Crohn's & Colitis Foundation's site, they have tons of information on diet, the foods that can cause gas/bloating, women's issues, surgery, coping skills, locating a teen support chapter near you, as well as a live chat & hotline that is run by healthcare experts. There is even an open forum that you can post this question to where others who have Crohn's or ulcerative colitis can answer your questions.<br>  <br>  Ask your GI what is the safest thing to take to decrease bloating such as Gas X, beano, simethicone tablets, etc. Also, there is a camp oasis in the summer time sponsored by CCFA for kids that have IBD in some states. They get to spend a week w/others like themselves and it's supervised by doctors, nurses, and the counselors have CD or UC so they can totally relate to the young campers.<br>  <br>  Definitely look into CCFA's site. You will be amazed at how much information is there. There is also stuff on the newest treatments to get the illness in remission: Entocort, Humira, Remicade, 6MP, and Imuran.|`|iqGaNZTtaa	The inflammatory response of Crohn's can cause it. You may try binding the excess gas with an adsorbant such as (chewable) Simethacon, an inexpensive over the counter preparation. Also, tell your doc.|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Talk to your doctor.|`|RGdzVXcdaa	My son was diagnosis with Crohn's disease over 2 years ago. the doctor wanted to put him on Humira (after experimenting with several other drugs) which is anexpensive drug with life threating serious side affects. We did some research and wanted to take a new approach to combat His problem. This is what we found out. The liver is producing too much bile that is toxic to the digestive tract. The types of foods you need to eat are those that DO NOT create excessive acid or bile that help in digestion (simply put). The bile is normal unless it is in large quanity or toxic, the acid attacks the food as well as intestinal linings of your stomach<br>  Your body is high in toxins that you need to remove and stop feeding into the problem by the foods you consume and an overactive liver.<br>  <br>  1.) "Foods to eat" : water purified, fish, eggs, potatoes,rice, white bread,meat ground up fine or chewed well, skinless chicken cut fine, tortillas, broth, noodles plain with a little butter, plain yogurt with no extra ingredients, Goats milk or rice milk(rice dreams-Walmart) cherrios rice crispies or chex, plain oatmeal and 'most important' 5x/day at each meal and as a snack, legume's black beans, kidney, pinto, buttered,refried, with no lard or spices except salt to start. Sunshine calcium and D'3, Iron supplements(in moderation)<br>  if you are anemic.<br>  2.) "Foods to avoid!": fruit juice,dairy!,milk (hardest to digest, a cow use 4 stomachs!) chips!,processed foods of any kind, fast food of any kind, soda ,msg,sugar,corn, corn syrup,corn sweeteners,wheat products,sweeteners of any kind, coffee, teas,sauces, read the back labels (you are going to be surprised) for added ingredients any thing thats added, adds to your body's toxic level. NO artificial sweeteners. foods that produce too much acid to break down the foods you eat. No alcohol of any kind NO Tabacco. pork, fatty foods.<br>  3.) 'Foods to eat': in moderation after you stop bleeding and start gaining weight or are having no discomfort : certain fruits,steak,venison, peanut butter or almond butter, more plain oatmeal A multi-vitamin with minerals with 100% RDA (not large dose's of any vitamins and 2x daily ,use shaklee as the bench mark for comparison ) of all of the B's, hard cheese, soy milk,well cooked vegetables" Psyillium powder".<br>  4.)The beans,psyillium powder and oatmeal are a soluble fiber that absorb bile and remove the toxins in your body,then the liver will produce more bile but less toxic(simplified for lack of space).<br>  5.)This is not an all inclusive list and your Doctor will disagree with the elimination of drugs, all removal of drugs should be done slowly if you decide to stop taking them, but they will add to your body's toxic level as you continue take them. which will make your Crohn's worse and make you susceptible to other more serious disease's. I am not a specialist in any field or giving medical advice. I also hired KarenHurd.com at a fraction of the cost to teach my son to diet properly but you can go to her web site and get free information, but I recommend you pay her for a short time to get you healthy and on a routine faster. She has a very high success rate. Stress will make it worst so exercise and relax. Most importantly Faith, Hope, and Prayer, you will get better. God is faithful what ever the results. E-mail me if you have any questions and I can help. I don't know if you have crohn's but changing your diet could help you and most of us in America because of the poor nutrition we unknowingly subject ourselves too. Ibs and colitis is similar but the diet still apply's. Routine and a little bit of self disipline and you will be drug free and have more money in the pocket. You may have other complications with the Crohn's because you are now susceptible to all kind of complication's and other disease's because of the medicine you take!<br>  (10 months later and still healthy with minimal problems )<br>  (12 months and healthy and no more Drugs!!!!!!!!! )

ChYa4LzXaa	Yes.  Because the BC is regulating your period and the cycle it is trying to get you on may be different from your current cycle it is normal to miss up to your first 3 periods.  Normally it will say in the paper you get with your BC that it is completely normal.  It is also normal to have "Break through bleeding", even if you do not have your periods.  Don't sweat it unless you start to miss them after I'd say 5 months.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Most definitely! You are taking artificial hormones and it takes some time to get used to.

AA11315244	I don't think your quite ready for any prescriptions. I would suggest seeing a therapist once a week. Although, if necessary Prozac seems like a good fit. And I do think you should know that taking anti-depressants do NOT make you want to go out and do things. They don't take on that type of effect and do take a course of months to take it's full effect. I highly suggest booking an appointment with a therapist! Good luck!|`|exMPHWKHaa	It sounds like you need to make an appointment with your doctor and tell him/her all of the things you mentioned. I myself am 17 and currently dealing with severe depression, OCD, a social anxiety disorder, and PTSD. Don't diagnose yourself see a doctor and let them decide what the best coarse of treatment will be. Anti-depressants will not make you free like being drunk or something I think your thinking or benzos like xanax, valium, or klonopin which I was prescribed for a month and then taken off. These work extremely well for anxiety and make you feel really high but its hard to get them at this age. The anti depressant I am on (Prozac) does not do much other then take suicidal thoughts away. I still have them but definitely not as much as I used to. Thats about all its done for my depression and sometimes it will make you feel like a zombie... like you can't express emotion. I wish you the best and hope you get better sometimes meds can work wonderfully and really help people out depending on your situation. Don't panic and tell your parents and make an appointment with the doctor. You don't even have to tell your parents if you don't want to just tell them you need to see the doctor for something.|`|LaJn6jxJaa	an antidepressant.

FOR AN ADOLESCNET boy i would suggest at least 2500-3000  calories a day if you are active (for more accurate estimeates create a profile at caloriecount.about.com or consult your coaches) and utilize a couple oh high calorie WHEY protein shakes a day.

AA10164052	I believe that you have to be at least 18 to have it.<br>  <br>  I had mine in October of '06 and I can't tell you how glad I am that I did!<br>  <br>  I had pretty poor vision and was getting a prescription change twice a year...for glasses & contacts!  My eyes were so tired, they became irritated by all contacts, so I had to switch to glasses only.  Finally, I realized that the expense of all of these tests & prescriptions was out of control, so I go the surgery!  <br>  I had a consultation, where the office explained EVERYTHING wonderfully!  They gave details about it all.  The following week, I went in at 7 a.m. and left the office at about 9 a.m. with my vision!  The procedure itself took only about 10 minutes.  The rest was numbing eye drops, resting afterward, etc.<br>  I highly recommend a TON of research into the place you choose to have it done.  If they have great bedside manners and are willing to take time to explain everything, keep them!<br>  <a href="http://www.tlcvision.com/centers/chicagoland/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tlcvision.com/centers/chicago...</a><br>  <br>  This link may have answers, too.

That's when most people prescriptions start settling down.|`|VriZPTHbaa	I had Lasik eye surgery done after wearing glasses for 16 years. It has been perfect for me. I have had no changes. Of course, as I age, I expect changes. I also co-manage refractive surgery and have seen hundreds of successful patients. It doesn't hurt, generally. There is a bit of pressure, but no real pain if you have LASIK. The PRK version (where no flap is cut) is a little more uncomfortable for the first few days following the procedure. I've seen several people who said they were in some pain, but healed just fine. I used to wear both glasses and contact lenses. I had LASIK done and it's the best decision I've ever made. I can see clearly, no squinting, no driving with glasses anymore. I can read road signs, see the individual leaves in the trees (they're not just a blurry mess anymore). It's also nice to be able to see what time it is when I wake up. The procedure is painless (although a bit uncomfortable) but takes less than 15 minutes. Highly recommended. <br>  <br>  If you need help finding a reputed surgeon in India u can check out the ink below:<br>  <a href="http://www.indianhealthguru.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianhealthguru.com</a><br>  You can schedule a free appointment there and they'll answer all your questions and see if you qualify as a good candidate or not|`|T2InEmKCaa	i'm not sure what Lasik is, but if you mean laser eye surgery then i could give u some info. i've asked my doctor the same question, and he said, it is not recommended to get it done until your eye sight stops worsening. if it does not stop, meaning every year gets worse and worse then you should wait until your around 20,21 cuz thats the time when your eyesight naturally stops worsening and stays on one level of eye sight. so yea thats when you can get ur laser eye surgery done. i wanna get it too :p... right now im gonna try contacts, but its hard putting em in.. hopefully this helped you...<br>  <br>  A21|`|TPTnzRI3aa	You have to be eighteen.<br>  I have not had it done.
48SKEteeaa	Mmmmm. This is a very difficult condition to treat and understand. That's why answers have been slow to come in. First of all this condition is genetic and the boss was born with it.<br>  <br>  So how do we treat this condition? The recommended treatment is for you to find a new job. Anal retentives usually can't be treated and many are volunteered for euthanasia. Some consider alternative therapy worthwhile. Examples of this are snipping tyre valves on boss's car, the employee being totally uncooperative, refusal to work overtime, being uncontactable outside work hours...there are many others. The problem with alternative therapy is it rarely leads to a cure.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	No, more like a psychologist.
F1OIGwtBaa	Raspberry leaf tea helps to bring you feminine hormones into balance. It is non toxic and will not 'force' your body to do something.<br>  Whether or not rasp leaf will help you depends on why you're experiencing anemorrhea. Are you under 18 years old? Over 40? Under a lot of stress? On an extreme diet? Have other serious health issues? Are you taking medications? Have you already started menstruating and then stopped?<br>  <br>  Your answer to these questions (and there are more, but you get the idea) can make a difference as to what you could or should do about your lack of cycle. <br>  <br>  When I was in my 20s, I had only 1 or 2 periods yearly. That was fine until we decided to have a baby. I bought the liquid form of black cohosh, raspberry leaf, and dong quai (all of which help to bring a woman's body into hormonal balance) and some empty capsule. Twice daily, I took a half capsule of each and started menstruating with a few weeks. From that point on, I've been on a regular 28 day cycle - and that's been 24 years. <br>  <br>  A small - and consistent - amount of each herb is all I needed for balance. Taking more than needed wouldn't have hurt me, but it would have been a waste. It's like when you have a headache - 2 'aspirin' will relieve the pain, more than two won't act any faster or better. Likewise, lots of raspberry tea won't do more for you than just using one or two tea bags daily. I don't believe that any amount of raspberry tea will have a negative effect on you. But if you have been drinking the tea and seeing no results after a couple of months, then it may not be addressing your need.<br>  <br>  Herbs that bring on menstruation are called emmenagogues - and there are many out there. Do a google search and find information that addresses your situation and see what other sites have to say. If I were to go on about it here, this answer could be 10 pages long and still might not address your needs :-)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

I started noticing I could hear less and less over about a year and now have an almost 50% hearing loss.  Mine was from wearing headphones with loud music.  I also now have constant loud ringing in my ears and i no longer know what complete silence sounds like.  Trust me on this, the ringing is a horror.  Sometimes exposure to really loud music can leave the ears kind of shell shocked, with loud ringing in the ear and a sensation that feels like you have cotton stuffed in the ears so you can't hear well.|`|77NzfiVkaa	None your hearing just gets worse and worse.|`|tDZMJue9aa	my husband has a blockage in his right ear, he works on jets and wears his earplugs always has, he hears a slight buzzing in his ear like tinnitus i think is how its spelled.....he says it gets annoying

I like  hairless legs, and long hair (up or down).<br>  <br>  The skinny Victoria Beckham look is so wrong on so many levels.<br>  The Fat Mo Mowlam look is a turn off - for me.<br>  But some guys do find these sizes appealing, normal for them i guess.|`|7PyGI4ewaa	thin lower body, large breasts but not too large. i like short (emo) hair black or brown, or even blonde for that matter. no leg or pubic hair. hygenic, body and womanly parts. small bum. cute face, nice eyes. like blue. ;)|`|Aon6gJVbaa	It depends... I think I love to have curvy body... it all depends upon a person.

For example Kate Winslet. I don't know why this sort of figure attracts me, perhaps it's some instinct about them having better child bearing abilities or some such crap.
6adc597e9fb33038cff31ccea702d7bcaa	John is correct, though they rarely do it that way.  If it's not an emergency and you had to make an appointment for it, then they're probably going to take blood with a needle and send it to the lab.  This is because the finger prick test is less accurate.|`|UlXBL8tbaa	Yes, you'll get your finger pricked by a lancelet.. Unless your DR orders more in depth lab work such as a Hemoglobin A1C test in which case they'll draw blood via the Phlebotomist.<br>  <br>   Good luck.<br>  <br>   :)<br>   ;)|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	If the physician does not need other laboratory tests then indeed nearly all physicians will prick your finger and use a glucometer to determine your blood glucose level.  Modern glucometers are just as accurate as drawing blood from a vein and sending it to a lab.  This is the reason for the use of a glucometer.  It is simple, inexpensive, and the result is available literally within seconds.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|0nyWiro9aa	Glycohemoglobins are also important and so one of those might also be done as they provide a three month average of glucose values and if one is so contemplated then a blood sample would be drawn for that.<br>  Glucometers are fine for normal use but for extremes in glucose ranges then a blood sample is needed for the very low and the very high values.|`|bd12e48132951f215b7fe910f10580d4aa	I go to the doctor every 3-6 months for AIC test, ya know to average my blood sugar.

Maybe you've only experienced this with a certain group of women, or those who are joking/ trying to be funny or whatever, because there are a lot who don't chuckle after asserting an opinion. That's making a sweeping, sexist generalization. Ever hear of Ani DiFranco chuckling when she's asked to speak a few words at a rally or performing her poetry about rape and abortion? What about Condoleeza Rice (Yeah, a lot of what she says are opinions, maybe not all her own, but probably Bush's or the Republican party's)<br>  <br>  When I say, I think abstinence only education is detrimental to our youth and isn't doing a gosh darn fricking thing for anybody... that's my opinion, but I didn't chuckle when I said it.<br>  <br>  Next time a woman... or anyone else for that matter... chuckles after stating an opinion, take a closer look at the context and/ or the person saying it. After all, the ditz who chuckles after talking about how cute she thinks the color pink is, is a whole lot different than the sisters arguing over why or why not their dead father's organs should be donated to save someone else's life.|`|AA10103365	umm.. same reason men do? .. haha i think everyone does that... or maybe not.. haha i dont know|`|AA11833827	They are crazy|`|1790932d9178885218cfffaffc0c1f50aa	i think it's because of their vagina. it creates a juice called:<br>  ajkdielskja; lkjdslkj klj 1000-233. it makes them high. man drink this juice to get buffed. it's called steroids. so in general. steroids are made of vagina juice|`|f25eb76e73caf4e8631198dc921cb724aa	its like a nervous reaction|`|063327825fa1f5bf21e56f047c951627aa	that's there 25-35 laugh, they have the giggle from 15-25, 35-45 they get the robust heavy haw, haw, haw, and after 45 they snort.

There are men who last 20 minutes but their partners complain that they did not wait for her -- or worse yet, draw comparisons with her last lover who had set a record for marathon thrusting. Consider another couple who plays for an hour after a very romantic evening. In the course of love play the man manually and then orally stimulates his partner who, in response, has three orgasms. He then mounts, thrusting hard and deep, and ejaculates in about 45 seconds. This couple then holds each other in the afterglow of their intimate exchange, telling each other how wonderful the lovemaking had been.
AA12003439	There could be several factors why this is happening. It really depends on your age women go through several changes and some women even go through a time when they can't orgasm properly. If this persists for more than a week I recommend you see your obgyn or have your husband perform oral sex on you. Maybe it has become too routine and there needs to be a change in the manner of sex. Try something different. And yes exercise does alter a women's period because more testosterone is present preventing the period from reaching the appropiate time.|`|8OoXtmHdaa	no|`|n8p2ZGUfaa	You're horny or pregnant.|`|xkqro91eaa	that hasnt happened to me cuz im not a girl but i suppose it is just hormones.|`|CxWf6FdZaa	I've never been on time since I started to have mind but as my mom always say 'If you're married and you get delayed YOU'RE PROBABLY PREGNANT"<br>  not trying to scare you..

M3sVQm2Maa	Hi. I've had PCOS since puberty, and now I'm 38. I've never found anything that helps me lose weight, but PCOS usually means you have a problem with insulin resistance or with reactive hypoglycemia. Most things I've read promote a low glycemic-index diet, a diabetic diet, or a lower-carb diet. <br>  I would forget about trying to lose weight quickly, because it will just come back on quickly. And if you're insulin resistant, your body is really really good at storing fat and not good at all at burning it. The upper limit you should shoot for is about 2 pounds per week. If you find a method that works for you, you might be able to get there by August...that's about 22 weeks from now.<br>  Exercise is essential. If your metabolism is as sluggish as mine, you'll need to do plenty of aerobic exercise. Exercise, even if it's just walking, helps sensitize your body to your insulin. <br>  So they say! I've been Wii Fitting for 4 months and haven't lost an ounce, but maybe you'll be luckier than me. <br>  Good luck!|`|6fjMtWboaa	This will help....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.obgyn.net/pcos/pcos.asp?page=/pcos/articles/pcos_and_diet_mckittrick" rel="nofollow">http://www.obgyn.net/pcos/pcos.asp?page=...</a>

AA11411084	Well, it sounds like strep or tonsillitis. Possibly mono, but check the other two first.<br>  Trust me, I'm an expert at either of the two, considering I had strep over 40 times in one year when I was a kid. And I currently have tonsillitis for the millionth time.<br>  Anyway! If you have pain and stuff go to the mirror an stick you tongue out. Get it as flat as you can. Most people have to press their tongues down with something. If there is a problem you will basically be able to see them. and is some cases they may have white mucus looking bumps on them.<br>  If they do then you need to go the doctor asap. If not and your throat is hurting you should probably still go, just it's not so urgent. And keep a CLOSE watch on them.|`|FEhmNTL2aa	When you look in the back of your throat do you see 2 chunks of meat?  They are hard to miss if your tonsils are indeed swelling.  If you can't see two chunks sticking out then chances are you just have a case of strep throat or just a sore throat. Do you have white crap in your throat when you hold a flash light and look in the mirror?  If so go see a doctor and get antibiotics.

DWpEy5HPaa	Yes, I simply probed my phallus into the vacuum cleaner. It is blue and sore. I would not recommend it, but my penis is bigger nonetheless.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	I've heard that when you stretch it,it gets really skinny.Girls would rather have girth than length.(well most of them any way.)Sounds painfull.|`|osY0xlhTaa	One problem is that weight hangings cannot help the girth of your penis, and tend to stretch out the penis so causing an actual reduction in penis girth. The process is also extremely time consuming, requiring use of the weights for periods of up to 12-hours a day over several months.<br>  <br>  There are other major drawbacks. Weight hanging can sometimes stretch the ligaments too much and can cause serious problems and possibly even permanent damage, if not carried out correctly. There is some evidence that hanging weights from the penis can cause a long term restriction of blood circulation to the glands of the penis. This can cause infection or even gangrene in serious cases, which would ultimately lead to amputation. <br>  <br>  The most effective and safest way to get extra length and girth is with penis enlargement exercises. The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Don't be weird.

The vagina is not an endless canal. It can only hold so much. So if it is too long, it will be uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Women can feel width more than length, so in that case, a woman might be able to tell the difference in her enjoyment. However, there is such a thing as oral sex which can make up for an "inadequate" penis size. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, this is not something women stress to much about, despite movies/TV/magazines claiming it is.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Penis Size<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis_size" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_penis...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relationships/facts/penissize.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/sex_relations...</a><br>  Does size matter?<br>  <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=33342" rel="nofollow">http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/article...</a>|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Nope.

pa7rzc8Qaa	There are medications, natural and pharmaceutical, that can be very helpful for social anxiety disorder. I know that many drugs such as Paxil, Effexor and others have a fairly new "black box warning" from the FDA, which states that teens and young adults may suffer new or increased thoughts of self-harm and suicide and need to be monitored carefully while starting any such drug. Most physicians are familiar enough with anti-anxiety meds to know that they need to watch for that if they prescribe one to someone your age.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	It will just surpress your symtoms but you have to push yourself to be around social situations. The more you do it then you wil get used to it.|`|19fZOxiIaa	what is social anxiety disorder?|`|upvLAyyzaa	I would recommend seeing your doctor for a diagnosis, and then talking about your different options together.  Usually they will try to treat it with anti-depressants, since anti-anxiety pills are highly addictive.  In my experience, but everyone is different, anti-depressants didn't do crap for my anxiety.  It took me a very long time til I got my doctor to give me an anti-anxiety for my panic attacks.|`|hPdEZ4Ypaa	The treatment for social anxiety is the same as for depression. If you go to the doctor, they'll tell you you have less of the neurotransmitter serotonin that is a mood enhancer. Before trying expensive medications, get some Saint John's Wort where vitamins are sold. I take one a day and it really works. Just don't mix Saint John's Wort with a prescription antidepressant.

XNfWsUZaaa	It might be what doctors call cobblestoning. Its not so bad, more like a a shcaffing mark for coughing or clearing the throat. Do check with your doctors, if you don't have medical insurance I advise that you be easy on it.

VRsFXHvPaa	yes this is completely possible. No matter how old you are, you can become a victim to depression. You DEFINITELY should talk to a doctor and hopefully get your daughter a psychologist. It is no one's fault, it is just the way she looks at things. I was writing suicide notes at 5 years old and I had a wonderful home, wonderful parents, the best raising in the world. I was just depressed. I am now happier than ever on no medication, I someone matured backwards.<br>  <br>  Living through this, yes. yes it is possible :( Talk to her a lot. Make sure she knows she is loved and cared for. Make her opinion matter, make home feel like home so she can look forward to coming home everyday... but for sure see a doctor!<br>  <br>  This is NOT "just being a teen"!! It is more serious! "Being a teen" like so many people say just makes a person more irritable and emotional. But NOT this! These are signs of major depression. Puberty doesn't come with the "Major Depression" disorder! For years I was ignored because people thought I was "just being a teen"! lol were they wrong. Anyway, I'm glad you are not overlooking this! So many parents don't pay attention to their children until it's too late! Please dont think she is just being a teen and ignore it. Please take action! lol I implore you! Everyone deserves to be cared for and loved whether or not they are "being a teen".<br>  <br>  Sorry... got a little out of control there hah ;)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped, take care <3|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yes, depression can happen to anyone at any age...try talking to your school  counselor & they will help get you professional help.I feel so bad for you, if you ever want or need to talk just message me. Good luck.|`|QHASqNDtaa	It could be hormones.....but just to be safe, tell an adult.|`|2bda25059263fabb32a4c18d4bbf502aaa	You need a good friend to just let you vent and not to be judge on the things you say....Medication helps but is not the only cure....A poor diet can make you feel like crap....Try watching what your body consume and see if anything helps....GOOD LUCK...|`|Ta7snyIoaa	That's....life sweetie. It's probably just hormones, everybody has those thoughts weather we say it or not. <br>  The word 'depression' is thrown around so much, but I can just say from expierence that your probably "just being a teen".|`|pa7rzc8Qaa	Oh my, you seem to have every symptom of depression I've ever heard of, and I've battled it myself for years. The fact that you are 12 and female is not really significant in terms of whether you can suffer from depression. I'm male and my depression began when I was about 13. I think it is underdiagnosed in kids though, because parents and teachers think of kids' mood changes as "stages" or whatever, and don't recognize that it could be a sign of a more serious condition. It is common for teens and pre-teens to get depressed, for a variety of reasons. <br>  If you feel that you can bring this up with one or both parents, or a friend, or teacher, or anyone, go for it. I went into denial about my feelings and didn't get any help for it until I was 21, and by then I had developed social anxiety disorder as well. And I wish to this day I hadn't waited so long, because it made recovery much harder and I needed medication just to get it under control. Please don't wait to seek help, even if it means finding a professional counselor.|`|8781c2b8fec56cba142d67f5750bb0b9aa	Wow, this 12 year old sounds like a mess.<br>  <br>  Here are some numbers where you can get counseling and help:<br>  <br>  Youth Crisis Hotline 800-448-4663<br>  Child Help USA 800-422-4453<br>  RAINN (Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network) 800-656-4673<br>  <br>  Best wishes!!|`|03sZD5zUaa	that must be you because how do you know frequent thoughts unless you are a mind reader!

W4whHKmxaa	A patient cannot normally tell when the liver or<br>  spleen is enlarged.  Both are located under<br>  the rib cage.  If there is inflammation in<br>  the liver cells which causes the liver to become<br>  enlarged in size...the doctor can, at times,<br>  feel the lower part of the liver by placing their<br>  hands in the upper right quadrant of the<br>  abdomen under the rib cage.  Usually, they<br>  will confirm this with an ultrasound test.<br>  If this pain is on your right hand side of the ribs going toward the bottom part of the sternum...it<br>  may be the liver or biliary or gallbladder problem.<br>  If the pain is near the belly button and going<br>  to the lower right quadrant near your leg, it<br>  could be appendix.  If the pain is on your left<br>  side under the rib cage, it could be your spleen.<br>  Patients, when the liver or spleen are enlarged,<br>  may feel a discomfort or fullness in either one<br>  of these areas: liver to the right and spleen to<br>  the left.   Another thing that can cause pain is<br>  if there is a kidney infection or stone...stone<br>  are extremely painful if they go out to the ducts.<br>  However, the pain would be on the back area<br>  of the body near the back ribs and extend down the front area going along the one side near the pelvis bone and then toward the bladder.<br>  Women can have pain near the pelvis bone if<br>  they have a problem with their ovaries. <br>  <br>  I hope you find out what is causing your pain.<br>  Pain is very difficult to pin point.  A person can<br>  have pain in one area of the body and the<br>  organ or problem is located in another area...<br>  this is known as referred pain.  You probably<br>  heard of people who have heart attacks having<br>  pain in their left arm, but no where near the heart.<br>  <br>  The doctor can tell if there is inflammation or<br>  swelling in your liver or spleen by doing blood<br>  testing and possibly an ultrasound.  <br>  <br>  Wish I could be of more help.  Hope things<br>  turn out well for you.|`|zeTGmB3faa	A doctor will be able to tell some things just by touch. Appendicitis could be another possibility.

a1pmr73vaa	As a child grows his bladder grows also and can hold more urine. When a bladder is large enough to hold a cup and a half of urine, then a child will be able to sleep an entire night without wetting the bed. Not only does the bladder have to be large enough, but the development of neuromuscular control needs to be there also.You may not have a big enough bladder !? <br>  or <br>  Desmopressin, a hormone that stops enuresis by drying up extra fluid, can be given to a child in the form of a nasal spray. It has been found to be very effective. Another drug called imipramine can also be prescribed to a person to help stop bedwetting as it relaxes the bladder. This drug is not used as much as in the past due to side effects, and should never be given to a child under six. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No matter what happens people still love and care for you !!!!!|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	Have you ever been tested for kidney or bladder problems? <br>  <br>  If not you may need to see a urologist sometime soon.<br>  <br>  Some ways to prevent peeing at night is to not drink several hours before bed.

VB3ZK5f9aa	Yes, people have been known to have slight, undetected internal bleeding for long periods of time.  If he had known stomach ulcers, than the likelihood he would have hidden bleeding in the intestines is higher than normal.|`|716335ab6ea56965d0cb4b7367b650edaa	Yes its entirely possible. Some people can bleed minute quantities for long periods of time.  Here's what WebMD. has;<br>  Gastrointestinal Bleeding<br>  Gastrointestinal Bleeding Overview<br>  <br>  The many causes of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are classified into upper or lower, depending on their location in the GI tract.<br>  <br>      * Upper gastrointestinal bleeding: Upper GI bleeding originates in the first part of the GI tract-the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum (first part of the intestine). Bleeding can come from ingestion of caustic poisons or stomach cancer. Most often, upper GI bleeding is caused by one of the following:<br>  <br>            o Peptic ulcers<br>  <br>            o Gastritis<br>  <br>            o Esophageal varices<br>  <br>            o Mallory-Weiss tears<br>  <br>      * Lower gastrointestinal bleeding: Lower GI bleeding originates in the portions of the GI tract farther down the digestive system-the segment of the small intestine farther from the stomach, large intestine, rectum, and anus. Diverticular disease, angiodysplasia, polyps, hemorrhoids, and anal fissures most commonly cause the bleeding. Blood in the stool can result from cancers, inflammatory bowel disease, and infectious diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Gastrointestinal Bleeding Causes<br>  <br>  The many causes of gastrointestinal bleeding are classified into upper or lower, depending on their location in the GI tract.<br>  <br>      * Upper GI bleeding<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Peptic ulcer disease: Peptic ulcers are localized erosions of the wall of the digestive tract. Ulcers usually occur in the stomach or duodenum. Breakdown of the walls results in damage to blood vessels, causing bleeding. When the mucous membranes break down, they are unable to counteract the harsh effects of stomach acid. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), aspirin, alcohol, and cigarette smoking promote gastric ulcer formation. Helicobacter pylori are a type of bacteria that also promote formation of ulcers.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Gastritis: General inflammation of the stomach wall, which can result in bleeding. Gastritis also results from an inability of the gastric lining to protect itself from the acid it produces. NSAIDs, steroids, alcohol, burns, and trauma can cause gastritis.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Esophageal varices: Swellings in veins of your esophagus or stomach usually result from liver disease. Varices most commonly result from alcoholic liver cirrhosis. When varices bleed, the bleeding can be massive and catastrophic and occur without warning.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Mallory-Weiss tear: A tear in the esophageal or stomach wall, often as a result of vomiting or retching. Tears also can occur after seizures, forceful coughing or laughing, lifting, straining, or childbirth. Physicians often find tears in people who have recently binged on alcohol.<br>  <br>      * Lower GI bleeding<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Diverticulosis: One of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding. Small out-pockets, or diverticula, form on part of the wall of your colon (large intestine), usually in a weakened area of the bowel wall. You may develop several pockets, which are more common in people who have constipation and strain at stool.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Angiodysplasia: Along with diverticulosis, this is one of the most common causes of lower GI bleeding. Angiodysplasia is a malformation in the blood vessels in the wall of the GI tract. The sores are most common in the large intestine and often bleed. The elderly and people with chronic kidney failure develop the disease most often.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Polyps: Intestinal polyps are noncancerous tumors of the GI tract, occurring mostly in people older than 40 years. A small proportion of these polyps may transform into cancer. Colonic polyps may bleed rapidly, or they may bleed slowly and go undetected.<br>  <br>      *<br>            o Hemorrhoids and fissures: Hemorrhoids are swellings of veins in and around your rectum. Repeated stretching from straining at stool causes them to bleed. Bleeding from hemorrhoids is usually mild, intermittent, and bright red. Massive bleeding is rare. Anal fissures, or tears in the anal wall, also may trigger small amounts of bright red bleeding from the anus. Forceful straining during passage of hard stool usually causes such tears, which can be very painful.

The pulse does vary during the day with 2 peaks - one at around 11 AM and a lower peak at around 4 PM.  During sleep however the pulse may 'normally' drop into the 40s or even the 30s.

D8SpQAgLaa	Creatine doesn't give you "water weight". Your muscles store chemical energy in the form of ATP which gets burned and turned into ADP, then the mitochondria in your cells turn ADP back into ATP. Creatine gets converted into ATP. So when you work out, you can lift heavier weights and do more repetitions.  This is how creatine works - not by giving you water weight.<br>  <br>  Yes whey protein will work, you need to get lots of protein.<br>  <br>  As far as the workout, it wasn't clear but it sounded like you're doing the same workout every day.

AA10294399	That depends on how severe your anxiety is and your tolerance to benzodiapenes. I know people who are prescribed 2mg twice a day but can take six because of tolerance.  It's about like xanax milligram for milligram.  My wife is prescribed 8mg a day but she has developed a tolerance over a four year period. By the way, the chief medical director of a psychiatric hospital prescribed it for her so I think he might be an expert in psychiatric medicine..|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Do you mean lorazepam the tranquilizer? There is no record of loazadem. If it is the first, then 2 mg's are to much. Most people are prescribed .05mg. This is a tranquilizer and you will not feel the affects, you will just drop and that's it. I take these for severe seizures and only 0.05 mg. These are not to be fulled around with. Take no more than you have.|`|1wDkKyLCaa	I'm on it but it's never affected me bad, knock on wood
d9ec61258876df4dee880db1902839e4aa	Hey, if you're still in high school it doesn't really matter what classes you take. Just know that you have a long road ahead of you. In college you'll need to take many science and math classes (organic chem, bio, physics, calculus 1-3). I suppose it would be a good idea to get a head start and take some of these in HS, although you'll have to retake them in college anyway. After you graduate undergrad you'll enter medical school, after that you take your boards and then if you pass you'll enter your intern year. Followed by three or four years of residency, depending on your specialty. For Oncology you must first specialize in either Internal medicine or Family Medicine, then sub-specialize in oncology. You should also know that there are different types of oncology (surgical, medical, etc..). During your undergrad years you should definitely volunteer at a hospital. Actually, I recommend it now! <br>  <br>  I've known I've wanted to be a physician since I was very young. At 14 I started volunteering at hospitals. At 16 I became a certified medical assistant ( I draw blood, administer meds, immunizations, and injections, perform EKG's, etc) EXPERIENCE IS KEY! Now at 18 I'm still a medical assistant and am enrolled in an internship program at HOAG Hospital in Orange County. (This will be my 4th medical internship). Remember as a physician you are commiting yourself to a life of learning, especially as an oncologist, you won't start making money until you're about 33, and you will be very in debt with student loans (avg is around $200,000). <br>  <br>  Don't do it for the money. Do it because you love it. I definitely recommend getting out there and finding out more about what working in the healthcare field entitles. It's not easy and it's not for everyone. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. Best of Luck :D

Vj13f7zmaa	You certainly can.  But you don't pass away painless into the night.  It very painfully destroys your kidneys.  If you survive, you may need kidney transplant, and most certainly would need dialysis for a period of time.  So if you are trying to figure out how to do yourself in.. ibuprofen is an extremly painful and ineffective approach.  If you are asking because you need to take some and are afraid to take too much, no worries.  My Dr. has had me take as many as 4 of the 200mg every 6 hrs.  Not for long term, but for a day or two.

w3lsUxqHaa	Sounds serious.  If it were me I'd be calling the doctor every day till he can tell you what is wrong & how to deal with it. Has your son been given baby shots lately? Some children tend to have flu type reactions to shots, similar to what your son has.  Is his tonsils swollen? Tonsillitis can be very serious. My oldest son had recurring fevers, & extremely fussy & whiny, until I took him to a specialist(ear nose & throat doctor) & had his tonsils & adenoids taken out, the kid hasn't had a sick day since, now he's 35 yrs. old & healthy as a horse. It's probably just a virus though, & with a lot of those you just have to let it run it's course. If the child's temp gets over 104 put him in a lukewarm water almost cool, to cool him down as quickly as possible. High temps. are dangerous, don't try to force him to eat, but liquids are imperative. Good luck to you, hope he gets well soon.|`|mx3YK5rLaa	So he's drinking the Pediasure okay? He's not throwing that up? If he's throwing up clear that means his little tummy is empty and he needs to eat. Did the pediatrician test him for strep throat or an ear infection? <br>  <br>  When my daughter throws up these clear liquids it is usually in the morning when she hasn't eaten all night. I would shcedule another appointment and get a quick strep test done and have him/her check his ears.|`|4hsrILZbaa	Strep is going around, and can cause those symptoms, so you should return to the pediatrician and have them double check. If he's losing weight you should try and find something with a higher calorie content that he can drink. Also, pediasure can be high in sugar, so sometimes its best to mix it with whater to prevent further dehydration.

It is probably a good thing that you aren't too worried about it ... because if you do have Multiple Sclerosis ... stress can bring out your symptoms more quickly.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully after all the test are back ... you will find that it was good to have checked it all out and get a proper full diagnosis.  Ask lots and lots of questions and inform yourself about anything the doctors tell you.<br>  <br>  Most people tend to worry too much about potential findings and by the time they have a true diagnosis they are so exhausted emotionally, mentally and physically that  it has harmed them more to worry than what is actually wrong with them.<br>  <br>  Chin up ... patience and if we could solve all problems in the world with worry then I guess "worrying" will be worth it.  Until then ... let's just take one day at time and deal with one situation at a time as well.<br>  <br>  Best of luck with your tests and results!

There are support groups to help in education and emotional support, and when you need one, do not hesitate to join.|`|AzKVaxu9aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I hope that you don't have MS. I've had it fo 25 years and many people do well, especially, in the early years. While waiting for the diagnosis, take good care of yourself. Get plenty of rest and avoid the heat. People w/MS get fatigued easily and are heat sensitive. If you don't have MS, it can't hurt.<br>  I agree that stress is really detrimental on MS, so finding positive ways to deal with stress is great and even more so with a chronic illness.<br>  Educate yourself.

What is the point of worrrying anyway? If you have it, you will learn how to deal with it and if you don't - no big deal. you might want to look up some facts about the testing you will be undergoing. NMSS.org is a great place to start. I began like you did 15 years ago and was just recently diagnosed - I hope for your sake that you will have answers sooner!|`|NqBxDyM0aa	When I first had symptoms of MS when I was 29yrs old I went to a nurologist and even when that dr said that I should check into the hospital for tests, I still was not all that worried. I wasn't really thinking it was anything big. After I was told I did indeed have MS, that is when it got to me. I was sad at first, but the next day wanted to get to a computer to find out all I could about the disease and what I possibly could be looking forward too. To answer your question, it is not odd. I would advise you to look on the internet and find out what exactly the test you might be undergoing. This will get you prepared so you won't be too worried about what the drs are doing or what they are looking for. It is also best to be familar with the lingo that might be said regarding the tests.

Usually people who are strong in faith are not worried. Yes, go to the doctor and do the things you are supposed to do but put that together with your faith...Some people think that you are being irresponsible if you aren't worrying..that is not true..Being anxious will only multiple a problem and sometimes makes a mountain out of a little mole hill...God bless you and keep up the positive attitude. With that positive perspective, you can overcome anything..

fk9AvB25aa	If you don't have genital herpes on your mouth then you can give oral. Just don't have regular sex when you have an out break.<br>  You can't give some one herpes through oral sex unless you have oral herpes (what can cause cold sores). <br>  When you think about it the wrong part of your body is coming into contact with your partner genitals. Your genitals have to come into contact with your partners mouth or genitals in order to pass herpes on.

AA11615976	While marijuana, Ectasy, cocaine, and heroin are all dangerous, the two most deadly drugs in the world by far are alcohol and tobacco.  At least 400,000 die every year from diseases related to tocacco use alone.  Tens of thousands die every year from alcohol-related traffic accidents. I know of cases where people have even been charged with murder in drinking/driving accidents where someone was killed.|`|zsYJklW5aa	Even though alcohol is legal, i would say that they are all the same because legal or not people still abuse them and mess up your whole body. on your report you should say that all of them are bad and explain how they are bad. some might be worst than others but people just always end up dying from drugs, or a least ruining their life.|`|xvr5nK9aaa	Alcohol, it's legal, people abuse it, people die from alcohol poisoning more than any other drug...<br>  <br>  I have health a month ago :)|`|EtOYeANLaa	"LOVE" is the drug that causes more problems than all the others combined|`|41PJpTXAaa	My opinion they're all harmful.

HQFUnslhaa	It sure sounds like a yeast infection. Get the Monistat, eat more yogurt and drink plenty of cranberry juice. That's what I did when I had one. That's also what the doctor told me to do and friends as well.|`|nrTVlo8Eaa	It sounds exactly like you have a yeast infection. You'll need to use an antifungal cream such as monistat for the prescribed period of time. Believe it or not, a generic tube of athlete's foot cream will work just fine because it's an antifungal medicine, too.<br>  <br>  Don't worry, yeast infections heal with no problem.<br>  <br>  If you wash your genital area with a gentle soap once a day, then, you're plenty clean enough. It isn't dirt that causes yeast infections.  <br>  <br>  Yeast infections are caused by a couple of different things, but usually it's because your genital area stays too moist for too long...like if you were to wear a wet bathing suit all day, or if you wear pantyhose that make you sweat. The other thing that commonly causes yeast infections is when you take a strong antibiotic that kills off the friendly bacteria in your vagina.<br>  <br>  You can also take acidophulus, which is basically the same stuff in that pro-biotic yogurt, which can help avoid a yeast infection, but won't cure it as quickly as monistat and the others will do.|`|sdVXij0oaa	you're probably getting a urinary tract infection. you should check it out...|`|OLXv3DEAaa	If you've never had a yeast infection before you are supposed to go to the doctor to get it checked out at least the first time. There are a lot of other things that cause redness, itchiness and some like a urinary tract infection can need antibiotics to clear up. It can be hard to tell the symptoms if you've never had this before? It sounds like a yeast infection to me but I've been wrong before:/<br>  <br>  If you have discharge thats unusual its more likely to be a yeast infection. If you have any trouble urinating, it burns to urinate or you feel like you have to go and then you actually don't then its more likely its a UTI or similar infection. <br>  <br>  You don't generally get yeast infections from not cleaning that area well unless you have really bad hygiene- its way more common to get them from cleaning too much because soaps/perfumes can irritate the area or get rid of the stuff that keeps yeast from forming. <br>  Basically you have a certain amount of yeast naturally, they are kept in check by certain 'good' bacteria your body has. In a yeast infection good bacteria gets disrupted somehow and the yeast overgrows. This link has a list with a lot of the main things that cause yeast infection. Yogurt and monistat are a good idea but I would see the doc first to learn the symptoms and figure out exactly what you have<br>  <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~eisthen/yeast/causes.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.msu.edu/~eisthen/yeast/cause...</a>|`|J4hOL3oLaa	Monistat is good. Especially the 3-day treatments. Make sure you dry the area very well after showering. Do not wear tight pants and maybe no panties for a few days. Wearing wet bottoms like a bathing suit causes this too but I dont think this is the case since it's the middle of winter. Good luck!

The water is clean again and the proof is under the rainbow.|`|ParFJxnSaa	It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method. Try replacing a negative thought with a positive affirmation of your choice, like: "I am a unique individual, with my own set of skills, and good points", or "I may not be perfect, but I'm doing the best I can, right now".

FicyC2TXaa	Thanks April for those statistics. <br>  <br>  I'm going to address myself to the issue of fundraising and breast cancer.<br>  <br>  I agree that awareness needs to be raised about other cancers too.and while I hate 'competitive illness' I can see why there is resentment about an imbalance in awareness raising and fund raising.<br>  <br>  BUT...the reason breast cancer is so high profile is simple - sheer hard work. Breast cancer awareness campaigns and BC Awareness Month started as a campaign by ordinary women, many of them with cancer, to raise awareness so that people knew the symptoms, examined themselves regularly, attended their routine mammograms etc. Enthusiastic participation and hard work by women made it grow into something nationally, then internationally, recognised (and then big business cashed in). Any group of people can start such an awareness campaign for any illness.<br>  <br>  There are other cancer awareness months, ribbons etc; but no cancer campaign has had the sheer hard work put into it that breast cancer awareness has.<br>  <br>  If prostate cancer awareness is a cause close to your heart (good for you if it is) there is nothing to stop you and a few friends starting a campaign in the same way those few women who started the whole breast cancer awareness campaign did. You'll have to be as dedicated as they were and work as hard as they did though.|`|AA10481903	April gave you some good information.<br>  <br>  I would like to add that breast cancer has a powerful lobby that pushes a lot of the funding by Congress.<br>  <br>  Additionally, most women that are diagnosed with breast cancer eventually die from the cancer.  However, most men with prostate cancer die from something other than the prostate cancer (because most cases of prostate cancer are slow-growing types).<br>  <br>  Best wishes and good luck.|`|HumMEMu5aa	It all depends on what has a high profile image that celebrities can identify with.  There are about 200 cancers; many receive very little funding for research, until a celebrity becomes involved - look at Kylie Minogue (her having cancer did an enormous amount of profile raising for younger women with cancer);  I am sure Patrick Swayze and Jade Goody would rather not have the publicity, but the one good thing to come out of their cancers is that charities will receive more money.<br>  <br>  In the 80s and 90s it became 'fashionable' for women to support breast cancer charities.  Suddenly this had a high profile, and celebrities were kind enough to fund raise.  Then along came AIDS, and celebs. such as Elton John and Elizabeth Taylor became involved in fund raising.  <br>  <br>  Sadly, there are many, many diseases that do not have a high profile, that desperately need funding, but have to rely on the enthusiasm of a few supporters.  That is why, on my website www.after-cancer.com, under Events I list both large and small events in aid of cancer.  If you want to have fun, do support one of them near you.<br>  <br>  Verite R|`|AA11865529	It's not just the number of deaths, it's how many are affected. Breast cancer occurs in one out of 5 women. Five women die every HOUR from breast cancer. So I don't know where you get your figures from. It also  affects much younger people, in the prime of life.<br>  <br>  Prostate cancer occurs in 1 out of 11 men. Prostate also occurs late in life and as my dad's doctor said, he was more likely to die with it than of it. Prostate cancer has a 90% survival rate for five years.|`|Q4ggnG0waa	About 1 in 8 women and 1 in 6 men will be diagnosed with these cancers sometime in their life. Almost 30000 men each year die from prostate cancer. Almost 40500 women and about 450 men died last year of breast cancer. Don't know where your info came from.<br>  <br>  The United States invests approximately $16,700 to find a cure for each life lost to prostate cancer; more than $21,800 for each life lost to breast cancer, and about $160,000 for each life lost to AIDS.<br>  Those are the actual stats and I know where you're coming from. I had a brain tumor and everytime I went to my various drs offices, there was breast cancer awareness info everywhere. Pink things everywhere. All the magazines I got to read were about breast cancer. I felt left out!<br>  <br>  I told my dr I was jealous and felt left out of the "group" because I had brain cancer. He just smiled! He's always told me I'm his most unique patient.

170GrvE0aa	You should not get the transition lenses. Personally, I don't find any advantages using them. Just get the prescription glasses/sunglasses. They would look better and feel better too. If you're worrying about the price, you shouldn't have to worry. www.optical4less.com is an online prescription eyeglasses store which sell eyeglasses for really cheap. Try it out.|`|EobQv52saa	There are good and bad things all of the options. Transition lenses only change when they react with ultraviolet light. They won't turn dark in the car because the windshield filters UV and stops them from changing. They also change better during the winter than summer because cool air makes the cells condense. Usually you want them darker during summer because the days are brighter but the lenses aren't going to block as much. Another negative is that the lenses always have a dull color to them. People will always notice the lenses are a little discolored even when you're indoors and that bothers some people. Magnetic clip ons are nice because you don't have to worry about them being dark enough, but they make the glasses heavier and you have to keep up with them and be careful to not lose them. Prescription sunglasses are nice because you can usually get a really stylish frame and special coatings put on the lenses like a mirror finish. It can be expensive to buy two full pairs of glasses though unless you find a good sale or insurance. You also have to be careful to keep up with a second pair for when you need them and not lose them or leave them somewhere. I've had all of the above and I've always been happiest wearing separate clear and sunglass pairs since it's hard to make one pair of glasses act like two completely different kinds.|`|9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	In my opinion, two separate pair is the best way to go. Transitions are ok, but as everyone else has said, they always seem to have a faint tint to them. They don't get as dark in the summer or in your car -the two places you need them the most! Clipons are nice too, but for most people, their glasses style and sunglass styles are completely different. I know I prefer a much bigger lens with a little more wrap in my sunglasses. This is why I would want twoseparatee pair!<br>  <br>  In our office, we offer 1/2 off your second pair, so be sure to ask about similar promotions!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1da901c1e68f32ae8b022510892d658baa	It's a personal choice, but this is what I decided....<br>  <br>  I got prescription glasses once.  Everytime I needed them I had to take them off to swim, off inside, etc....<br>  <br>  I don't like transitions, because they still look brown inside on a hot day for a while.  I don't care for it.<br>  <br>  Ultimately = I just got contacts.  BUT - If you wear glasses all the time now - you're probably used to them.  I'd say go for it.  They are neat.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I, personally, wear prescription glasses and have prescription sunglasses!

dwLqreuvaa	Well to start off this is not an uncommon problem. <br>  <br>  Why? This could have been a habbit you have developped while younger. Usually you don't notice this because you don't notice you are doing these things. This dug in deep into your mind and its pretty much like an everyday think for you.<br>  <br>  I chew on stuff also, but some goals to set for yourself is maybe every single time you by accident chew on something, keep a rubber band on your wrist and snap it on your wrist as self disciplin.<br>  <br>  You did the first step, discovering you have a problem, and habits are hard to break. My habits like biting my nails were never too severe but I did self disciplin and now i don't chew on them.<br>  <br>  For the things you chew on you can maybe coat them with tape, or lemon juice so when you chew on it, its icky. Take something other than lemon that will make your taste buds foil in disgust.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|nB8zqdfJaa	I used to do that but only when i was nervous about something and not paying attention to what i was doing.

0nyWiro9aa	Ketones are breakdown products of fat. One sees them in the urine when on is dieting through caloric restriction (reduced food intake). When one does not take in enough food the body uses fat and produces ketones. This is where the ketogenic diets get there name from. Those in such diets want to see ketones in the urine. <br>  <br>  Diabetics suffer from ketosis as a result of the cells not getting enough internal glucose and a similar process occurs with regards to fat breakdown and usage. Diabetics have increased fat in the blood in the form of triglycerides. The first thing one thinks about when seeing such fatty blood is diabetes. This can be a life threatening condition in diabetics and one avoids such things in such extremes.<br>  <br>  In-vitro means "in glass" or test tube and not meant for internal use or within live systems (in-vivo).|`|5sF73gyMaa	I'm a Type 1 Diabetic and I have Ketostix.

lPO4D8PLaa	Yes, this could be an emergency.  His symptoms indicate that he may be having a stroke (that could cause the dizziness and the speech problems).<br>  <br>  As someone suggested earlier, Aspirin might be beneficial (it would help prevent clots from forming) but strokes can also be hemorrhagic (which can be worsened by Aspirin).<br>  <br>  Edit:  hmm.. well, the speech problem and dizziness are kinda scary and its crucial to treat strokes early (to prevent irreversible damage).  They can do labs at the hospital and do a CT angio to look for clots/bleeding in the brain or brain steam (which can cause the dizziness).  Thats probably my biggest fear.  Other things to explain the symptoms could be just hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), food poisoning, or dehydration.|`|D19F6m92aa	Go to the emergency room now!|`|gNM35w7Raa	Call an ambulance time matters, do it now|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	Give him aspirin to chew and call 911|`|CCnej03qaa	Yes, anything could be going wrong.

The alcohol and aspirin would be thinning is blood which could be beneficial in preventing clots, however alcohol is never good for anyone anyway.

YRJShhKraa	I have been getting my glasses at costco since I was 5 and I'm now 15. They have very reasonable prices compared to other eyeglass places. First you pick the frames which range from less than 50 to over 100, so once you get the lenses too the price will probably be anywhere between 100-200 dollars but it just depends on which one's you pick. Another good thing about buying your glasses at costco is they will fix or adjust them for free whenever you need. Hope this helps! =)|`|cdgm85A6aa	You will see when you get there. You don't need to buy your glasses straight away - just get a copy of your prescription then shop around at other places before deciding.
zMD0VeOmaa	Insulin resistance is a common symptom of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a syndrome where the hormones become out of balance. <br>  <br>  So now let's analyze your diet:<br>  <br>  100 grams of carbohydrates (CHO)=400 calories(1 gram CHO=4 calories). 100 x 4=400. <br>  <br>  400 calories is less than 25% of your total calories.<br>  <br>  The American Diabetic Association recommends that 55% of calories come from CHO for diabetics, while 20% should come from protein(PRO), and 25% should come from fat. <br>  <br>  So it is also helpful to know that there are 4 calories per gram of PRO and 9 calories per gram of fat. To figure out the % calories for a nutrient take the number of calories from that nutrient divided by total calorie intake.<br>  <br>  Maybe you aren't diabetic yet but you are certainly at increased risk due to insulin resistance. I would suggest eating carbohydrates consistently throughout the day at the same times. Avoid skipping meals. Remember that starch, milk, and fruit affect blood sugar. Starch includes breads, cereals, pasta, starchy vegetables such as corn, potatoes, and peas. <br>  <br>  If I were you I would become familiar with the exchange system. This will help you plan your meals. If you eat 3 meals per day you need 5-6 servings of CHO at each meal. What is a serving? 4-6 crackers, 1/2 cup of fruit, 1 small slice of bread, 1/3 cup pasta, 1 small baked potato, and 1 cup milk or yogurt.<br>  <br>  That is good that you have a calorie deficit. Don't be afraid to eat a lot of carbohydrates. A low CHO diet builds up ketones in your blood and they are used for energy instead of glucose. Ketones are used when your body is in starvation mode. Your brain needs lots of glucose to function well. A low carbohydrate diet is also associated with lower levels of serotonin. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that positively affects mood.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|rgcW2ly1aa	you sound like you have a healthy diet<br>  and no i dont think 100 cals is too much i actually think you should take in more calories as long as you burn it off

Talk to you doctor about it just to confirm, but it doesn't sound like breast cancer to this nurse.|`|eG6tjXp8aa	the best advice is to see a doctor. if its nothing atleast you wont have to worry anymore but if it is something then they will be able to find out quickly and fix it :)|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	See a doctor, have a mammogram. <br>  Good luck.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Maybe you just pulled the muscle somehow.

IJXy9ZuRaa	Finding your own self worth comes from within you. You have to be ready to really sit and think about you, what you want, the things about yourself you like and dislike. Only you can change them. The bible will give you inspiration to complete this process. The first step is to stop beating yourself up over past mistakes. You need to realize that you are a great person and the things your not happy with about yourself...change them. Its a slow process but you can do it. If you are goin on what others are saying that makes you feel the way you feel, STOP...dont give someone else the opportunity to make you discouraged with yourself. If you in a conversation with someone and the subject of you and what you may have done...stop that conversation quickly. People have a tendancy to put someone else down to justify there own issues with THEIR SELVES. You do what is best for you. Aaron...you arent any different than anybody else when it comes to not feeling your self worth but be different than those people and make you and your life a happy one. Surround yourself with thoughtful friends. I have friends that have stepped up to the plate and got me thru some rough times. Im fighting this battle now...no self worth but im working on it and i seem to be doing better. Im not doin anything any different than i am telling you. I often tell people, if you dont have something nice to say..keep your damn mouth shut. I have to fight my own demons, im not fighting them and you. Keep your head held high and know that you are somebody special. I get up every morning..i know this seems crazy, but i tell myself how wonderful of a person i am and i firmly believe that. I deserve happiness  but that starts from within me. If im not happy with myself, how can i truely be happy. It will all come in time. Try doin something nice for someone else...i know that helps me. I have alittle ol lady that i go and see sometimes, jsut to keep her company. She enjoys it and in return it makes me feel good that i did something for someone who has no one. You need to be the one to reassure yourself of how great of a person you are, dont wait on someone else to tell you. You prove it TO YOURSELF FOR YOURSELF...nobody else. Just hang in there, it will get better. You made the first step in getting rid of the ex...i think she is alot of the reason you feel the way you do...so stop beating yourself up and go enjoy life. if you need to ever talk, my yahoo im is michellemullins1975...im usually on.

Cerebral aneurysms occur more commonly in adults than in children but they may occur at any age. They are more common in women than in men, by a ratio of 2 to 1.[1]<br>  <br>  The pursuit to identify Genetics of Intracranial Aneurysms has identified a number of locations, most recently 1p34-36, 2p14-15, 7q11, 11q25, and 19q13.1-13.3.<br>  <br>  Congenital disorder involves defects or damage to a developing fetus. It may be the result of genetic abnormalities, the intrauterine (uterus) environment, errors of morphogenesis, or a chromosomal abnormality. The outcome of the disorder will further depend on complex interactions between the pre-natal deficit and the post-natal environment.[1] Congenital disorders vary widely in causation and abnormalities.

17b088d67647626fb8f52e0b628f36f1aa	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening disorder that causes severe lung damage and nutritional deficiencies. <br>  <br>  An inherited condition, cystic fibrosis affects the cells that produce mucus, sweat, saliva and digestive juices. Normally, these secretions are thin and slippery, but in cystic fibrosis, a defective gene causes them to become thick and sticky. Instead of acting as a lubricant, the secretions plug up tubes, ducts and passageways, especially in the pancreas and lungs. <br>  <br>  Respiratory failure is the most dangerous consequence of cystic fibrosis. Also, the secretions block pancreatic enzymes that help digest fats and proteins, and they prevent your body from absorbing key vitamins. <br>  <br>  Treatments for cystic fibrosis are aimed at relieving symptoms and complications. <br>  <br>  <br>  The specific signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis can vary with the severity of the disease. For example, one child with cystic fibrosis may have respiratory problems but not digestive problems, while another child may have both. In addition, the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis may vary with age. <br>  <br>  Signs and symptoms in newborns <br>  In some newborns, the first sign may be a blockage of their intestines (meconium ileus). This occurs when meconium — tarry, greenish-black stools normally passed by an infant during the first day or two after birth — becomes so thick it can't move through the intestines. Other signs in newborns may include: <br>  <br>  Failure to grow <br>  Bulky and greasy stools (steatorrhea) <br>  Frequent respiratory infections <br>  Signs and symptoms in children and young adults <br>  Cystic fibrosis symptoms in children and young adults may include: <br>  <br>  Salty taste to the skin. People with cystic fibrosis tend to have higher than normal amounts of salt (sodium chloride) in their sweat. This may be one of the first signs parents notice because they can taste the salt when they kiss their child. <br>  Blockage in the bowels. <br>  Foul-smelling, greasy stools. <br>  Delayed growth. <br>  Thick sputum. It's easy for parents to overlook this sign because young children tend to swallow their sputum rather than cough it up. <br>  Coughing or wheezing. <br>  Frequent chest and sinus infections with recurring pneumonia or bronchitis. <br>  Protrusion of part of the rectum through the anus (rectal prolapse). This is often caused by stools that are difficult to pass or by frequent coughing. <br>  Enlargement or rounding (clubbing) of the fingertips and toes. Although clubbing eventually occurs in most people with cystic fibrosis, it also occurs in some people born with heart disease and other types of lung problems. <br>  Cystic fibrosis may also be accompanied by: <br>  <br>  Growths (polyps) in the nasal passages <br>  Cirrhosis of the liver due to inflammation or obstruction of the bile ducts <br>  Displacement of one part of the intestine into another part of the intestine (intussusception) in children older than age 4
Apd3fHJTaa	angina is a symptom or description of having chest pain, heaviness, pressure etc. an ekg can show if there is abnormalities such as ischemia, injury, rate and rhythm of your heart. ischemia and injury can be from blockages or narrowing of the vessels. if they see anything abnormal on the ekg they may proceed with a stress test or cardiac cath or possibly labwork to check electrolytes and cardiac enzymes.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	If you have a 12 lead EKG *while* you are having the pain/symptoms, and it shows ischemia, then that's diagnostic of angina.  They will certainly do further, extensive tests.<br>  <br>  A resting EKG with no symptoms by you could easily miss diagnosing anything.  Ischemia (which causes angina) is a transient condition.  Like a cramp in your calf.  When it's there, it's there.  An hour later...no way to know you had the cramp.  OK, it's not quite that simple.  And a 12 lead can show some associated changes....I don't know how likely that is.  But it is certainly better to get the test than not.  I never heard of a 6 lead EKG.<br>  <br>  Do you live in a major US city?  I am a paramedic in NYC.  If you lived here, you could call 911 when having these pains.  A medic ambulance would respond and do a 12 lead EKG on the spot, while the symptoms were there.  Of course, we would want to take you to the ER, also.  But that's not mandatory.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	Having done extensive research on the electrocardiogram, having written a book on ECG interpretation, and having taught ECG interpretation I feel that I am able to answer your question.  A 6 lead ECG became obsolete in the 1950s thus only a 12 lead ECG should be done.  If your physician does not have this ability then I would suggest that you seek another physician.  The ability to detect angina is not based upon whether the ECG is a 6 lead or a 12 lead.  Technically angina is a symptom and it is not possible for an ECG to diagnose angina.  Angina is caused by ischemia which means inadequate blood flow to the heart.  The ECG is capable of detecting this but there are problems using only a resting ECG.  The 12 lead ECG detects only 10% of the electrical activity of the heart.  If the ECG is 'positive' then there is a high likelihood of coronary artery disease.  If the ECG is normal however it is of no value in determining whether or not you have ischemia.  Your symptoms do not suggest that your discomfort is related to the heart.  I would question whether you should have a resting ECG at all unless you have multiple risk factors for premature cardiovascular events such as a heart attack.  It should be noted that the symptoms of coronary artery disease in women is quite different than that in men.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|AA11615294	A stress ekg can show ischemia to the heart with the heart under load. A stress test will tell more than a simple resting ekg. The test can not show angina but it can show signs of reduced blood supply to the heart that is the underlying cause of angina.
J2Y5zx4Saa	... if your throat feels as if it is closing you need to seek medical attention because that is a sign of a serious allergic reaction to something.

fv2GAAdPaa	Most people who develop pneumonia initially have symptoms of a cold which are then followed by a high fever (sometimes as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit), shaking chills, and a cough with sputum production. The sputum is usually discolored and sometimes bloody. People with pneumonia may become short of breath. The only pain fibers in the lung are on the surface of the lung, in the area known as the pleura. Chest pain may develop if the outer pleural aspects of the lung are involved. This pain is usually sharp and worsens when taking a deep breath, known as pleuritic pain.<br>  <br>  In other cases of pneumonia, there can be a slow onset of symptoms. A worsening cough, headaches, and muscle aches may be the only symptoms. In some people with pneumonia, coughing is not a major symptom because the infection is located in areas of the lung away from the larger airways. At times, the individual's skin color may change and become dusky or purplish (a condition known as "cyanosis") due to their blood being poorly oxygenated.<br>  <br>  Children and babies who develop pneumonia often do not have any specific signs of a chest infection but develop a fever, appear quite ill, and can become lethargic. Elderly people may also have few symptoms with pneumonia.<br>  <br>  See the link below for more info;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.medicinenet.com/pneumonia/art...</a><br>  <br>  Hope i helped!<br>  <br>  =]|`|sw2R5A9iaa	same as the late signs -a chest xray will decide treatment.  see your doctor.|`|usgKQuS1aa	a bad cough, pain when you breathe in or out, fever, chills.

Better than Zicam because you can take it even after you've had a cold for days.  Whereas Zicam is supposed to be taken during the first day or two. It helps with any upper respiratory problems.<br>  I've also been taking Tylenol Severe Cold (Warming) It's nice!
ufgv7oTjaa	Candess is right about there being Zinc in Zicam, which is a good antioxidant. However, the bigger reason it helps is because it is Homeopathic, which helps stimulate your body's natural healing responses and lets your body fight the cold easier.<br>  All that being said, it is best to be careful not to take Zicam too often or in too high of a dose because too much of it has a possibility of having an adverse effect on the smell. Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|rjGVh7ksaa	The mineral zinc helps the body's immune system.

YAS3mwD8aa	The chances of getting HIV through oral sex are only theoretical or close to nonexistant. The chance is estimated to 0,00005% (1 in 20 000 exposures) but up to day there hasn't been a single proven and documented case of transmission through oral sex.

There are all sorts of diseases you can get that won't go away--like herpes, HPV, and other viruses.  Once a virus is in your system, it won't leave.

RSOBUg22aa	there are three shots which are all supposedly the same shot; however, when i had the first one i didnt even feel it (i am not joking, though it may be because i was expecting so much worse), and the second hurt a tiny bit but not even stinging, and the third hurt more like the muscle in my arm and they all got my arm pretty sore so make sure you do arm circles after to keep it from getting sore.  less than a flu shot and less than ear piercing|`|6uo0NbUgaa	Yes, it hurts worse but not that bad.  The only thing that's worse about it is it aches for a while.

As pump technology and ease of use have improved the number of type 1 diabetics with pumps is steadily increasing.  As with anything else you will find good physicians and poor ones - good diabetic nurse educators and poor ones.  If your physician and / or diabetic nurse educator is not sufficiently skilled or if they are not listening to you (a common problem) then go to a different physician and / or diabetic nurse educator.  Never give up when it comes to matters of your health.  Keep trying to find someone with the knowledge and the communication skills to help you to learn to use your pump to its full capacity.  It may be frustrating and it may take a dozen visits to different practitioners but surely in a city the size of Brisbane there must be competent individual.

5jf5tcMnaa	Most likely the swelling is a result of the adult lateral erupting into her mouth.  The timing would certainly be right.  The adult tooth could be erupting behind the baby lateral, which would be why the baby lateral is not coming out...it still has some root left in bone since the adult tooth did not resorb the root away.  <br>  Of concern is the fever, since that and swelling indicate an infection.  If this continues you will definitely need to see a dentist.  Otherwise get your daughter to continue working on wiggling that tooth...and get it out of there, or again, the dentist will have to do it for you.|`|1nINGDC7aa	normally this is the age when the lower lateral erupts. this swelling and pain is because of the adult tooth trying to come out in the oral cavity. for more information on children dentistry you can visit the following link<br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCategories.aspx?ArticleCategoryId=33&Name=Children%20Dentistry" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/ArticleSubCate...</a>|`|KLPHXDiYaa	Sounds like her tooth is trying to erupt.

I imagine it depends upon many things, and it takes years, but it is happening.  It appears that many diagnoses like autism and diabetes are really from pathogens and toxins.  My children no longer have autism.  Diabetes does not run in our family, but low blood sugar does.  We don't have low blood sugar symptoms anymore either.  You can google DAN doctors or go to www.generationrescue.org to find local parents who have been to your local doctors.  They will give you information on what is available.  Also, you can go to Yahoo Groups on autism and ask there.  You will find parents who are simultaneously treating their children for autism and diabetes.  There is a lot of work involved, due to diets, and lots of supplements.  But, it is wonderful to see the results, even though we all wish they were quicker.  Since our children have such poorly functioning organ systems from pathogen and toxin overload, they have to be slowly made well.  Get on those forums, and go to those websites, and let the healing begin.  You will be amazed at what you learn.  But, it may take a lot of work on your part, learning lots of things along the way.  We parents feel like scientists by the time we learn all about nutrition, diets, supplements, pathogens, toxins, and gobs of treatment choices out there.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	I would not say that I specialize in treating diabetics with autism but I have a dozen or so such patients in my medical practice.

Nt7exGYAaa	Asthma has undoubtedly been around since the start of mankind.<br>  <br>  In ancient medical texts from India (from a system called 'Ayurveda'), which go back a few millennia. <br>  <br>  The word asthma has Greek roots. It is derived from a Greek word called 'aazein', which means 'sharp breath'<br>  <br>  Although the word asthma occurs in the Iliad (by Homer), it was Hippocrates, the Greek physician, who first used it to describe the medical condition, around 450 BC. He pointed out the symptoms of the disease, including spasms. <br>  <br>  Another Greco-Roman doctor, Galen, (130-201 BC) found out that asthma symptoms were caused by bronchial obstruction. He had the idea that it should be treated with wine laced with owl's blood. <br>  <br>  So really there's no date known as to how long it's been around as it's possible it was diagnosed as something else before given the name of asthma.
TH8ySLAzaa	If your getting ulcers inside your mouth that may not be caused by the Herpes Virus.  You may have a common sensitivity to Sodium Laural Sulfate (SLF).  It is a common foaming agent found in most tooth paste.  Try switching to a brand that is SLF free like some of Thoms of Main or Rembrandt.  Be sure to check the label for the ingredient.   With any luck, this may greatly reduce your mouth ulcers.<br>  <br>  Do some research on Herpes to better understand when you are contagious.  You shouldn't feel stigmatized because most people pick this virus up in childhood usually being kissed by an aunt or family member.  Check out: <a href="http://www.herpes.com/hsv1-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.herpes.com/hsv1-2.html</a> for some good information about herpes.  Hope that helps.  You might also want to start taking L-Lysine as this helps reduce outbreaks and is not a Pharmaceutical drug. As for being sick the outbreaks can be bad at first but your immune system will gradually fight  them off better and better it may take a couple of years but they should lessen substantially.<br>  <br>  Now your job is to become an active partner in your illness.  You need to do the Research because doctors are busy and often brush aside people with illnesses that they can not easily treat.

wwP3ONCFaa	Let him rest and relax. Extra rest enables him to put all his energy into getting well. It can also help him to avoid complications like bronchitis and pneumonia. <br>  <br>  Warm him up. Keep him bundled up against the cold. This keeps his immune system cozily focused on fighting his cold infection instead of displacing energy to protect him from the cold.<br>  <br>  Give him Chicken Soup. A long-time fold remedy is now a proven fact. A cup of hot chicken soup can help him unclog nasal passages.<br>  <br>  Medicate. Numerous medications for colds are available without a prescription. Some treat specific symptoms. <br>  <br>  To make him stop sneezing and drying up of runny nose and watery eyes, give him an antihistamine, which blocks his body's release of histamine, a chemical that causes these symptoms. Look for products like ChlorTrimaton, Polaraimine, Dimetane and Actidil. WARNING: Antihistamines frequently causes drowsiness, so save these for bedtime.<br>  <br>  Menthol or camphor rubs have a soothing, cooling effect and may relieve congestion and help him breathe more easily, especially at bedtime. Apply Vicks Vaporub or a similar product to his bare chest, cover up, and give him a good nights sleep.<br>  <br>  And of course, Take your Vitamin C for your  own protection

ziVtTtObaa	Stop worrying! Wait till you have the results. You most likely have PVCs ( premature ventricular contractions). It is normal to have a few PVCs. You may not notice it during the day because you are busy and distracted. In the evening you are winding down and it is now noticeable. It could be SVT (supra ventricular tachycardia) which also is not life threatening. Could be PACs ( premature atrial contractions) none of these are life threatening. All can be treated with meds if necessary. I have lived with SVT for more than 15 years. I take a beta blocker to slow my heart rate down every morning. I am healthy and very active.|`|2sycPf8Daa	Most people who have premature ventricular contractions don't need treatment. If you have occasional extra beats but you are an otherwise healthy person, there's generally no reason for concern and no treatment needed.<br>  <br>  Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) are extra, abnormal heartbeats that begin in one of your heart's two lower pumping chambers (ventricles). These extra beats disrupt your regular heart rhythm, which normally starts in the upper right chamber (atrium). As a result, you may feel a flip-flop or skipped beat in your chest. Premature ventricular contractions are very common — they occur in most people at some point.<br>  <br>  The following self-care strategies can help control premature ventricular contractions and improve your heart health: <br>  Track your triggers. If you have frequent symptoms, you might want to take note of your symptoms and your activities. This can help identify substances or actions that may trigger premature ventricular contractions. <br>  Eliminate common triggers. Caffeine, alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs are known triggers of premature ventricular contractions. Reducing or avoiding these substances can reduce your symptoms. Anxiety can also trigger abnormal heartbeats. If you think anxiety may be contributing to your condition, try stress-reduction techniques, such as biofeedback, meditation, or exercise, or talk to your doctor about anti-anxiety medications. <br>  <br>  If you have frequent symptoms or you have underlying heart disease, you may need treatment to help you feel better and treat underlying heart problems.<br>  Take care as always!

They were still in really deep.<br>  <br>  By that time, I had kinda forgotten about my baby teeth.  I had lost track of how many I had lost and which ones needed to come in yet.  Are you sure you haven't lost track?  Anyhow, it's not a big deal if you haven't lost all of them yet.

AzsYlqhJaa	First person guessed correctly.  You can always be a bacterial carrier.  Some people are chronic staphylococcus carriers, too.  You should see your doc, tell him/her about it, and have a throat culture taken.  They should probably culture other areas, too, such as your skin, just so you can know whether you are a carrier.<br>  <br>  As an infection control coordinator at a hospital, I once did nasal, throat, and skin cultures on every employee to see who carried what!

Eyeglasses only change your vision when worn.  You may experience headaches and eyestrain and neither of them cause any permanent damage.

My eyes were healthy during the years I did not wear eyeglasses.  I only have correction in my left eye and my right eye is normal.  My left eye's prescription did increase slightly over time, but that was its natural progression and not because I did not wear eyeglasses.|`|vMthRkrsaa	Yes it does.  There are tiny "muscles" in your eyeball that "focus" it kinda like a lens in a camera.   If the lens is bad the muscles overwork trying to get the focus your brain wants. <br>  Then you get "eye strain" and headaches.  That doesn't improve over time, just gets worse.<br>  <br>  Take care of your sight.|`|7gQVNuk4aa	Well, I mean, If you're supposed to wear glasses, that means your vision isn't a perfect 20/20.

M8B2i69gaa	Well, since you're not going to listen if I say not to cut in the first place, I can at least help you live without the obvious scars. Cut your hips for people not to see, fingers (they tend to heal without scars most of the time, and are a common place to get cuts, so no one will notice), and on places where your skin folds left marks (joints, for example). Then it can blend in with the skin fold.<br>  <br>  Just at least don't cut it too deep, and take care of the wounds to prevent the scarring. After you cut, put some peroxide on it and bandage it up or put a rag, cloth, or napkin over it for a while.<br>  <br>  Once it heals, put some Bio Oil on it to get rid of the scars.|`|Uv6qa3l6aa	wtf.|`|CaoNevvJaa	Cutting is dangerous!

DYUfnPzhaa	It could be inside out- if you balance the lens on your finger, and take a look at the side view of your contact, it should appear as a perfect dome.<br>  <br>  When inside out- the dome has slightly turned down edges.  It may seem slight, but if you can turn it both ways to compare, you will definitely see the difference.<br>  <br>  You may have transferred some 'debris' from the contact that you put in if it was not completely clean.  Put some eye drops in your eye, blink and give your eye a rest before putting your lens in.  <br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse, try another contact lens in your eye.|`|hD25pT1Laa	Mine usually HURT if I get them inside out. Maybe it is a little dry or you have some eye snot under the lens.
yE2vM76naa	It is not an STD -its what happens when the bacteria that naturally occurs in the vagina overgrows for some reason - the pH of the vagina is thrown off due to stress douching, etc.....for sometime they thought sex could transmit it, but repeated studies indicate that is not the case...  even babies can have it (though that is rare)<br>  And yes, you can have children after wards. Some people go untreated for a long time without treatment, especially as teens because people are afraid to seek treatment. As far as infections go, its not the sort that will ravage your internal organs the way STD's can.<br>  It sounds as if the medication for the BV gave her a yeast infection, which also requires medication - that is a common occurrence when treating BV.|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	no it is not an std. yes she can still have kids. and the new infection may be a yeast infection this time instead of a bacterial infection. sometimes antibiotics can cause a yeast infection. yeast infections and bacterial infections have very similar spmptoms. bacterial infections are cured with antibiotics and yeast infections are cured with over the counter antifungal creams (monostat or the generic form)

MPbB0ri1aa	FMS has to be diagnosed by a trained physician not every doctor knows how to properly diagnose FMS. Many will erroneously call any pain condition they cannot explain FMS and this is not correct. Most rheumatoidologist are trained in this. They go by your history of symptoms and if they have been chronic (usually 6 months or more). There are many symptoms that occur in FMS and not everyone will have all of them, but what is mainly looked at is chronic pain and chronic fatigue. There is also 18 specific points on the body of a person with FMS that when a specific amount of pressure is applied it will cause pain (in one without FMS is only feels like mild pressure, no pain). If at least 11 of these points are painful, then that, along with the history you are diagnosed with FMS. The physician needs to be trained on the just the right place to apply the pressure along with how much to apply.<br>  <br>  There is still so much that is not known about FMS and it is not an easy illness to live with. You look perfectly healthy and often other people will not believe you are truly ill. Also, once you are diagnosed with FMS you run the risk of untrained and ignorant physicians of blaming all painful symptoms you have in the future on FMS, which can lead to the new pain not being treated properly or not at all.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more about FMS here are some of my favorite FMS sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fmnetnews.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fmnetnews.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fmaware.org/site/PageServer" rel="nofollow">http://www.fmaware.org/site/PageServer</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fibrohugs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fibrohugs.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sover.net/~devstar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sover.net/~devstar/</a>|`|3061ed3a2f1d09c904ae44f8dc455d7daa	You have to see a doctor in person.

By doing this you will have a better understanding of your friend and what he is going through and what would put you at risk and what is safe.|`|166372a5d474ce786ecc08a423df8b11aa	you can only get it from open sores, sexual contact, blood, semen, needle sharing|`|40zewEkMaa	I don't think so, but you can get from just wiping someones tear.  Chances are his tongue was up somewhere where it wasn't supposed to be.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	NO! Why u drinking off of him anyway?|`|cSaVqUDdaa	nope :) your good.|`|WBnFf31Gaa	you cannot, get aids from drinking kissing, hugging, eating.. just anything that do not include blood infection.. but you can get aids having sex, or cut yourself with something that been cut the person who  have aids; blood transportation to other from other who have aids,or getting shoot in the hospital with the needle that been use with someone who have aids.. in that case you can not get aids by drinking unless you cut your mouth with the cup,cans,bottles that the person who have aids cut his/her self in the same spot you cut yourself. so you are OK if you no cut or you cut  yourself but a person with aids did not cut himself first before you.. <br>  but , for my reason.if you cut yourself  some how you should go for check up just in case... :)|`|hrK5ajDHaa	you cannot get it from having contact with someone else's saliva.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	no, casual contact doesn't transmit aids.
F89MNQheaa	Freeze it? You can only freeze varucas and warts. Your best of using witch hazel on it, or if its red try tooth paste as it takes the red away and drys it up.
PRCfCSDxaa	Yes, it can. I'm 16 and learned my lesson. I've had a UTI since the summer and it finally got treated in December. I barley went to the bathroom because I was either always sleeping or holding it because I don't use the public restrooms in school. You HAVE to go to the bathroom when you have to go or else it can come back again.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	of course it can, some of the things that cause urinary tract infections include: tub baths, synthetic underwear, wiping back to front after using the bathroom, not urinating immediately after sex, frequent sexual partners, and not drinking at least two liters of water every single day.  If you fall into any of these situations, you not only can get another infection, you probably will.|`|8Hoesmvpaa	yes ! some times it can come back it happened with my daughter she had it in one year  3 times and after that she is good ,but i hope you don't get it back .good luck|`|4KDDFobnaa	Yes, it could. My advice on minimizing the chances of a repeat infection would be urinating before and after sexual intercourse, which has a big impact on UTI's.
lTDeZ0Obaa	As others have said you should probably have it x-rayed just to make sure nothing is broken. When you punch or hit something, swelling does not ALWAYS indicate a fracture, but there are a lot of bones in the hand, so it's possible and it's best to have an x-ray to be certain.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, ice packs for pain and swelling, along with Tylenol (Acetaminophen) or Advil (Ibuprofen) for pain. Keeping it elevated will also help with swelling. <br>  <br>  Finally, quit hitting things. If you have problems with your temper see a counselor for anger management. You don't want to hurt yourself or others in anger!|`|nOU8WvmDaa	Why would u hit the door?|`|QK4r41Hqaa	Ice, and asprin (this helps with the pain, but also will help with the swelling)<br>  <br>  If you think it's really bad, then go see a doctor- you might have fractured it... Depending on just how hard you hit the door.<br>  <br>  It's probably just bruised, and it will hurt for a while.|`|AA12197561	You should put it in some Icey water.

dwLqreuvaa	The best thing to do isss....<br>  <br>  ASK YOUR ORTHODONTIST<br>  <br>  We aren't proffesionals here, even if we were we can't examine your mouth, we don't ahve x-rays. The only person that does is your orthodontist and if you have braces already they know what they are doing<br>  <br>  Braces take time, be patient. Braces are very expensive. Be happy you have them!|`|40zewEkMaa	Here is a really easy answer to your question.  TALK WITH YOUR ORTHODONTIST.|`|ou0sh511aa	Maybe you can get your wisdom teeth removed thats what i did and now my teeth are not bad braces will fix up the rest, ask your dentist or ortho|`|eDPPzIGqaa	YES ..THEY MIGHT TAKE SOME TEETH OUT TO HAVE MORE SPACE BECAUSE IS TOO CROWDED...U WONT FEEL A THING ANYWAYS!!|`|WJVLVf1raa	Eat some candy so they rot and fall out.<br>  <br>  they will pull them

dwLqreuvaa	White stains mean that teeth are more sensative in spots.<br>  Actually, this all depends on your teeth. Yes it is fixable but if you are young, (18 or younger) and you have those white spots on your teeht thats normal i had that too,<br>  <br>  I also had ridges in my teeth aswell as white spots and the ridges wore down from time, and i guess the white spots just went away with age. If you are over 18 and you are concerned there are options which you can discuss with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Also keep in mind that using a fluoride based mouth wash and a tooth paste especially for sensative teeth ; sensodyne (90% of dentists reccomend and i use it and its great) <br>  <br>  Even if you don't have sensative teeth it also has fluoride and will keep teeth white. As well as practicing proper hygene by flossing, rinsing and brushing your teeth is a good idea<br>  <br>  <br>  Also as Dr Tod reccomened Veneers aren't a good idea. Those are a bit too durastic for your condition. Veneers and porcelain covers placed on your teeth pretty much. But your teeth aren't rotting and don't need them|`|1nINGDC7aa	yes white stains are fixable. you can go for composite filling which has different shades and it matches exactly with the tooth.for more informationon composites you can visit the following link<br>  <a href="http://www.identalhub.com/Article_What-Are-Composites-40.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.identalhub.com/Article_What-A...</a>|`|KLPHXDiYaa	Generally bleaching will only make everything whiter, even the stains.  Minor cosmetic procedure such as bondings should cover the white.  Veneers are more invasive but will definately cover the white and look beautiful.  Depends on just how much white you have in teeth.<br>  <br>  Dr. Todd
AA11315244	There are two causes of watery eyes. <br>  1) Allergies<br>  2) Dry eye syndrome <br>  <br>  Most allergens are in the air which include pollen, mold, dust and pet dander. A air condition and avoiding any allergens can clear up the problem. If that doesn't work, consider taking an over the counter medication. A good over the counter drug would be a eye drop that contains antihistamines. <br>  <br>  Dry eye syndrome maybe whats producing the excessive tears. <br>  Dry eye syndrome is common in women with the fluctuation of their hormones. Talk to your regular practitioner about prescribing you artificial tears. Since I'm not able to see your eyes I'm not sure what other medications would work best..do you also have red eyes?
1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Oh, my - I was you so long ago.  I was 18 when I was diagnosed with HSV, and also a virgin.  I am now 37 and have lived almost 1/2 my life with HSV.  It does seem unfair, especially because there are so many promiscuous people out there that may or may not have STD's.<br>  <br>  I wish everyone knew that you CAN get genital herpes through oral sex.  That's why I'm at Y!A mostly.  But, I'm also trying to offer support to people like you.  I know this is a devastating time for you.  You are going to need support, and yet you probably feel so isolated.  I did for years.<br>  <br>  But, I promise you - you will be ok.  You need to first accept your illness.  It's a part of you, for life.  You didn't do anything wrong.  You can't beat yourself up over this.  So many people are in your shoes.  25-33% of Americans are diagnosed with genital herpes.  And, many of those people are living very happy and meaningful lives.<br>  <br>  You may suffer from prejudices and rejections.  Don't let this get you down.  You are a person that is a package deal, herpes and all.  And, is someone can't accept that, then they don't deserve being in your life.  Remember, you are more than this virus.  It's only a small facet of you.  You will be fine - and reach out for support.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	we all pay for our own mistakes, and sex without protection, oral or otherwise, was your mistake.  As for your future, there are ever increasing numbers of people infected with herpes, it isn't a fatal disease, just very uncomfortable... with the right medication and protection there is no reason you should not live a normal and active sex life.|`|ziVtTtObaa	oral HSV 1 can be passed to the genital. So if you or your boyfriend have a history of mouth ulcers you have just passed it to the other. The virus can be dormant for many years so after this out break you may never have another but you can always pass the virus to your partner (when you are shedding). from this point forward you most be honest and tell your partners you have the virus, always use a condom ( but even that is not 100% protection) .With oral sex you will now need to use a dental dam if your partner is virus free. You need to be on Valtrex. it will make the out break less severe and will help with shedding. Good luck. i am so sorry!|`|InI33juraa	ok first breathe!!!! its going to be ok!!! if ur friends wuld ditch u because of this they are not friends at all!! its not like they can get it unless u guys are all doing each other!!! u can get a daily prescription and take it to reduce outbreaks and reduce the risk of spreading it!! its not a death sentence!!!!!!!! if u need to talk u can email me ok!!!!!!|`|cSaVqUDdaa	awww hun im sorry. i understand that you feel down and in a total <br>  shock but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and there<br>  WILL be man who will look past that and love you for you :). <br>  <br>  herpes just like some stds dont show any symptoms<br>  and then you just get random out breaks or symptoms of<br>  of that type of std some times their flu-like and over looked<br>  that's why its all ways best to get tested regardless of how<br>  long you've been together, how much you trust on another,<br>  i know he/she is clean so i dont have to worry. always safe then<br>  sorry. they'll put you on some medicine i think its gonna be <br>  some type of pill im not sure. but you'll take that and<br>  continue to live a normal life. and also use it when you<br>  feel an outbreak about to come so it can deal with it<br>  be for hand. just remember you can still do the things<br>  you use to do. you just have to be more aware and protected.<br>  <br>  much love<br>  ?|`|fk9AvB25aa	My condolences on your situation until the results come back try not to think of the worst case scenario. I contracted herpes the same way you did. He most likely has cold sores and passed them onto your genitals.<br>  Yes bad things happen to even good people who never see it coming and even the ones who try to do what's best. Life is not fair when these things happen but things do get better over time. I think of it as what ever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger and hey herpes doesn't kill you. Try to stay positive and inform your self about herpes.<br>  Herpes has an ugly stigma attached to it which some people just can't get over. Herpes doesn't affect your life all that much accept when it comes to your love life. Not every guy will be able to accept some one with herpes. I contracted herpes from my boy friend (obviously he has herpes too) of over 3 years, we are monogamous with each other, still living together, trying to have kids and planning on getting married some day. All it takes is for one partner to have herpes and you could possibly get it from them. You can tell who ever you want to, if you think you can trust your friends not to tell future partners then tell them if you want to.<br>  You should know that even if you used protection you can still get herpes. Condoms don't protect all areas that genital herpes can affect.|`|pR4xp3xuaa	Herpes gotten from oral stay only in the mouth. But vaginal sex WILL give you herpes. Herpes is much more of an annoyance than a fatal disease. There is no cure unfortunatly. This is something you will have to live with. If you take it a step farther and hve vaginal sex, he should take certain medicines, avoin sex with an outbreak, and use a condom and you may want to use a diaphrame if you really need to. good luck.|`|5eSSAT69aa	talk to your doctor about valtrex.|`|AA12254889	I understand how you feel sweetie and just because you are careful does mean your not at risk, I know it seems really unfair, I was very depressed when I found out I had herpes as well, I was raped at the age of 12 and ended up gettin herpes from my rapist, and trust me you will find a guy that will date you even tho u have herpes, Ive dated alot of guys that knew the risk, 20 percent of people in american actually as Herpes and many cases have not yet been reported, Your not nasty, your not trash or a whore, things in life just happen for some reason I know it hurts, trust me i cried when i found out, but you wil be fine, i admit that yes you will have to live with this for the rest of your life, you may have outbreaks that will be painful but you will learn how to adapt dont dwell on the past okay just move foward, be strong okay and know that you will be able to find love despite what you have.....|`|Bldp1kAdaa	I am 18 and i got gHSV 1 from my boyfriends coldsore when i was 16! I was one of the girls who mocked the easy girls! yep ha....I only had one initial outbreak and then never again and im not even on any meds. This is very common for gHSV 1 to never get it again. <br>  <br>  Also, coldsores on your mouth are 5 times more likely to infect someones genitals then gHSV 1, crazy eh. I told my boyfriend i had one outbreak and he didn't care after i told him the stats. I know some people might not think this is morally right but I even know other girls who just told the person their with that they have a history of cold sores. Some doctors even say your not morally obligated to disclose gHSV 1 to a partner, considering most of the population already has HSV 1 antibodies, and you cannot get the same infection on a different part of the body. <br>  <br>  <br>  Cheer up girly, its gonna be ok! and my mom was the same way, she was so chill about it, almost too chill, she was like i have friends that have HSV 2 and their fine, get over it! ha it was harsh but i realize its true now!|`|j94HCVeyaa	well unless he had herpes shoudnt u be mad at him? but the thing is its the lil things that count- maybe it wasnt him- maybe it could be your school toilet that your vagina touched, could be a toilet roll that a girl in your school touched her Vagina then after that pull a piece of toilet paper off and then the virus was on the other piece of still connected toilet paper that u used, maybe its sink that you pressed in your school and then -the sink it self before that a girl touched her vagina then touched the sink to wash her hand, but lil did she know she touched her other hand, for just a split second then touch the sink, and then before you pee, you touch the sink then you go and go pee and wipe your vagina then youd get it<br>  <br>  Like many people think they can get herpes from just sex<br>  I see in the restroom was alot of guys dont wash their hands with soap after they piss, just touch the FAUCET then wash their hands with water and leave, then what u go in , and your bleeding your finger u touch the faucet and your done if they have dieases- u know out of 10 people only like 2 wash their hands with soap...<br>  <br>  even if you wash your hands with soap....after that you wash your mouth..then what? you take some paper towels out of the towel containers (which you have to press) and what happend before that?- a guy who didnt wash his hands with soap, but only with water- for less than 3 seconds, then in turn touch the towel dispenser handler... and then you touch teh handler and then paper then start wiping your mouth<br>  <br>  since soap doesnt even kills viruses, it could still wash it off, hopefully if you wash long enough<br>  <br>  see if you think your all safe, or something but u are careless about the rest- just remember its the little things that get you<br>  <br>  but yeah i feel for you, i mean like the thought in your head that you could had been clean but just some mistake made you stuck with something forever- wait but not forever, technology is rising, and with that will have new medicines, tehy are testing out new medicines as we speak, medicines that might even work already- just not tested yet- give a few more years a cure might already come out?
831a7af670f2985636729db688219516aa	Sounds like a low grade infection causing the swollen node.  <br>  <br>  The lymph nodes are designed to remove the toxins from your system, so the fact that one is swollen is probably a result of a localized infection and your lymph node is doing what it is supposed to do, even if it is a little overloaded.<br>  <br>  I had mono in college and lymph nodes being swollen are the least of the problems - if you had mono, you would have such things as sore throat, run down, chronic weakness, etc.<br>  <br>  Your doctor will probably prescribe an antibiotic for the lymph problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Post how it all turns out . . .|`|YCUJMvWQaa	i really dont know<br>  but i wish you luck and ill pray for you to be okay =]|`|0i4sNq2waa	the size of an apple would be extremely noticeable.|`|77yFiGJPaa	hey, hopefully it is not cancer although the size of apples, if you are not exaggerating, is frightening (but stay strong!)<br>  <br>  sometimes lymph nodes can get a bit swollen if you are close to that time of the month.<br>  <br>  and some people might have already been immune to mono when you were around them|`|B34Kstwcaa	Could be a "stone" I had one in my lymph node.<br>  Could be blood cancer<br>  Could be Mono<br>  Could be Lymes Diesease<br>  Could be a lot of things,|`|chPwS1BIaa	yea
3asVGB3eaa	Go to the doctor. Your body is telling you something is going on. You could have the flu, or something. Good luck!|`|TCFX0S5oaa	Usually with mono there is a bad sore throat, stomach pains are not as common but I vomited alot when I had mono. You might have it, but there is not treatment for it, just treatment for the symptoms like pain pills. take it easy and go to the doctor if you have insurance.|`|yOwRD4ZEaa	Those symptoms could be almost anything. No one can tell you if it's mono without an exam and a blood test.|`|viMIbjrSaa	mono makes it hard *not* to sleep, not the opposite. if its persisted for a while, maybe you should go see a doctor.|`|MDxakcB4aa	Gosh. Get of the internet and first thing in the morning go get tested!!
velIdcbNaa	It smells so bad because that is a big area for bacteria to spawn, and their waste causes the odor.  And having a dirty belly button would help contribute to that (not saying you are unclean)|`|MxxNjf9Zaa	Oh, that doesn't happen to me...<br>  Just really wash in there and try maybe body wash or some other soap or whatever you use if you don't think that it is working.|`|CgFwWfLDaa	it use to happen to me too....honestly i know why ur curious......next time when ur showering use some soap and really wash in there.....after about a week see if theres any diffrence...hope this helps!!!|`|AS8VyrVgaa	i've never smelled mine but i've heard everyone else does. <br>  i'm just weird like that haha.|`|4PAY40Flaa	its because that's where your ambilical cord was and poop used to come out of there. its normal, i guess. just clean it, alot
O2GRn8oOaa	if its really bad you need to see a doctor. to avoid future ingrown toenails make sure you clip them often. there are antifunal foot aids found in the meds section of walmart or kmart etc|`|TCFX0S5oaa	Antibiotic ointment, like neosporin, will work great! I use it on everything and it always works.|`|YC8X25OXaa	Clean it regularly (at least every morning and evening, and as often as possible during the day) with warm water and some kind of antiseptic.  If it does get infected (i.e. starts hurting more, swells up and goes red/shiny) then you aren't going to be able to stop it from spreading so you need to go and see a doctor to get antibiotics.  Don't leave it too long or it'll get really sensitive and you won't be able to walk. (I did that - it was a week of agony hobbling around on crutches!)<br>  <br>  It also depends on how ingrown it is - if it is only a small ingrown area then you can probably deal with it at home, but if it is really digging in and you can't get the ingrown nail out yourself, you will need to see a doctor to get it out, or you won't be able to stop it from getting infected.|`|IjVbz4rzaa	Go to a podiatrist and he will numb your toe before digging out the ingrown toenail.  Then, he will instruct you to soak it nightly for two weeks in 2 quarts warm water with 1 c. white vinegar added to that water.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Go & get Out-Grow it's specifically for in-grown toe nails you apply it on the toe & after a couple of days nail will start to lift out  & skin will heal I've done this & it worked

kN0eajwbaa	Born.<br>  How else would we be so good at it?|`|ijmcG1ziaa	ha ha, classic.<br>  <br>  Girls aren't born with it, and they don't learn it, either.  It's just a "phase" that comes along with puberty, and hormonal changes.  I can understand why some one would suspect they learn it, because all girls suddenly act up, and it becomes obvious to the surround people that they are "PMSing."  If you get what I mean.  Though like I said before, it's just hormonal changes, and it's just a phase.|`|M8B2i69gaa	You aren't born with it, but you don't "learn" it either. It doesn't even happen to all girls.<br>  <br>  You get it before you get your period due to your hormones (if you get it at all, that is). That's the ONLY time you get it in most cases, and you don't ever get it before puberty. It also can go away as the woman ages.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you two need to go to sex ed..|`|1gnNDagMaa	ok listen to me and very cleary, the information givn to u here expet the info given by sleepy sock is all incorrect. again sleepy sock has the correct explantion. iv answered this question way to many times and amm sick of boys concluding things. PMS stand for pre- menstral- SYNDROM. girls are neither born with it or learn it. got it? it happens a week or 2 before the period actually starts. not every girl has it, ye it is caused by hormons but it is a normal thing. it isnt her fault so man up and handel it. human are bulit the way they for one reason, to reproduce so grow up.|`|uvICu0gNaa	we are born with it you just have to deal with it. every girl PMS it's some kind of hormone raging problem lol jk|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I think PMS is caused by hormones in the girls body that increase before her period.  This is definitely not something we Moms teach our girls as they are growing up.  <br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|kep1iGHpaa	Yes her hormones change before her period.<br>  But that doesn't give her the right to be b1tchy.<br>  <br>  Your hormones change when you see a hot girl.<br>  Does that give you the right to r4pe her?<br>  <br>  Let her make the choice.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Neither.<br>  <br>  PMS occurs only after the girl starts to menstruate. And it is not a learned behavior, but rather a reaction to all the hormones flowing through her body.<br>  <br>  So, while technically we are born with the genetics to create hormones later on in puberty, girls are not born with the hormones already made.<br>  <br>  If you had to deal with feeling bloated and having excruciating pain, you would be moody too...|`|velIdcbNaa	Hmmm... Interesting choice of words, but we are born with it, it isn't a thing that can be taught. It usually doesn't start till puberty and we get our periods.  It happens before our period, some people get very moody, others dont get it at all, but it is different for us all.  I would trust her on the workings of a woman's body on this dude because we have been there done that.|`|fioNl1k7aa	i think it may be part both. we are told, almost from birth ,about pms, so we all complain about it. i use it as a excuse to be a ***** every month. it always works.......|`|QWylMGLGaa	You don't learn it, but it doesn't necessarily come with birth; just with you period..

lxrQyQ5raa	Well honey I know where you are coming from. I am 31 years old and I have been struggling with my weight all my life. I have tried so many diets and weight watchers and no luck.  So I am making a very big decision in my life to have the lap band surgery.  I am very scared but I know that I have to change my lifestyle before I start having major health problems.  So not only will it be nice to slim down, it will be nice to feel healthier and have more energy and have less back pain.  I don't feel like any diet really has worked for me.  And I have a major back problem and the only way to really fix it without back surgery is to lose the weight.  So I am going to have to put a lot of commitment into this.  But I don't know how much over weight you are however what I can say to you is you didn't put all the weight on over night so you can't expect it to come off over night.  Be patient with yourself.  I know how hard it is to be over weight.  And no one else knows how frustrating it is until they have been there themselves.  Buying clothes sucks for me because I am fat and very short, I have no energy, I have manic depression, and I just want a normal life before my life is over.  If i were you I would first try the point system at weight watchers.  I did really well for a long time.  I lost 40 pounds and then just gave up.  STUPID HUH?  But it is a good program if you can stick to it because they will teach you how to eat properly and reach your weight goal.  Good Luck Honey.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	More fruits and vegetables would be a good start.  Think about replacing your usual carbs (granola, popcorn, fruit snacks) with non-starchy vegetables and some fruit.

8yE2sYGeaa	An electric razor would do most of that (there is still burn, but not as bad), but i never feel I get a close enough shave|`|6kffeoyvaa	A big part about shaving that most new- and some older- shavers overlook is the pre-shave steps. Before you shave it is very important to loosen the hair with warm water. If you take a shower before shaving it wouldn't be a bad idea to use some of that conditioner on your beard. Stay away from that canned garbage too. Pick yourself up a Badger hair brush along with some quality shaving cream(in a tube(like toothpaste)) or shaving soap, not that pressurized can crap most people buy. <br>  <br>  After you have properly loosened the hairs and then applied a quality shaving cream then you can begin shaving. I recommend staying away from electric razors. Either use blades or buy a Duel Edged Razor (your grandfather may have used one) <br>  <br>  When you are satisfied with your shave apply an alcohol-free aftershave.<br>  <br>  Always shave WITH the grain unless your face can handle otherwise.|`|eR2rrcJcaa	hey, i use the mens electric razor even though im a lady :D lol<br>  it works great and it does not leave cuts or burns. i really like it. plus, its only ten bucks, wallet friendly ?<br>  <br>  here, i found one 4 u:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Battery-Powered-Shaving-1system/dp/B000BUW8WM" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Gillette-Battery-P...</a><br>  <br>  its only 7 on amazon :D|`|cgMrZYFjaa	Watch this<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX-jfbdepD0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX-jfbdep...</a><br>  Please Subscribe, And Comment|`|7aZUa6fMaa	for me electric isnt good... razor blades are the only way to go... electric never cuts hair... it takes forever... and it can make your skin break out alot too|`|AA11133320	yes yes yes yes no no wet and thats your problem|`|z7SJaMwuaa	You really don't need an electric razor there are cheaper options.<br>  I used to use the gilette fusion razor it was pretty good and i got hardly any scrapes or cuts. You have to get the gilette fusion shaving cream and buy the gilette fusion razor less then $20 but then after 3weeks or 2 you will need to buy the refills and those are like alot.<br>  Now I use a $10 schick quottro titanium razor with is powered by a batery which came with it and its about the same and the razor refills are cheaper and i use oldspice shaving cream . <br>  Really shaving is not suppost to take forever unless you dont shave every week. <br>  When shaving <br>  1. You take a shower and after you shave or you can pat your face with a hot wet towel then fill your sink with hot water and dab the razor in it. B4 this be sure to put shaving cream on your face.<br>  2. press the button on either the gilette fusion power or the shick to turn on the power shave in all directions of your beard the way you prefer.<br>  After that wash your face and use an after shave if u want
AA11727191	I would say call your doctor. Since its a long trip call the office and see if you can talk to the doctor. Tell him/her whats going and see what they advice you to do. Could be go get a meter, or go in etc. Your doctor knows your history and should be able to help you. Diabetes can be very serious and if not treated can cause you many probelms so it is prob. worth the trip to see your doctor. Could be nothing, could be diabetes, maybe even a UTI with the frequent urination. but it could also be nothing. As for the blurry vision if you have had it for a long time you should go to an eye doctor. You could need glasses. Also...you don't have to be old to get type 2 its just less common. Good Luck!|`|4onT0qUxaa	If someone in your family has diabetes, have them check your blood sugar with their machine and you can get a pretty good indication very quickly without seeing anyone. A normal range for blood sugar is about 80-120, with pre-diabetic levels being about 120-130. If your sugar is higher than 120, you should go to your Dr. and get a blood test to confirm it. Otherwise, you can pretty much relax!|`|2JTBPhuuaa	You can get a free glucometer online that comes with free test strips. When filling out the form say you're a diabetic who uses insulin. The drug companies think you'll keep buying their strips after the sample pack runs out. Keep track of your blood sugar over a day or 2 and you can be sure whether you're diabetic or not.|`|9vNeOUBUaa	If you do have it, they could treat it a lot better if it's foudn early.. so even if the Dr. is pretty far away , itll be worth it.....|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	You have classic symptoms that mean you must see a doctor.  100 out of 100 doctors will give the same answer if given your symptoms.<br>  This is certainly serious enough for a trip to the doctor.  When you call, describe your symptoms (briefly), and ask if you should fast before arriving, and for how long.  This way they can draw blood for the most accurate test, and save you having to go back just for the blood drawing.<br>  <br>  DON'T try to diagnose yourself using a glucometer.  There are more ways to make errors than I can describe - diagnosing diabetes is a lot more involved than a simple blood sugar reading.  Also, from the symptoms you describe, you may have a very high blood sugar level, and those machines would just display "Error message".<br>  <br>  "Pretty young":  if you are between age 10 or early twenties, you are at an age when diabetes often appears.  With blurry vision, extreme thirst, and very frequent urination.  You have waited long enough, and too long.  Does not sound like a fluke.  Is the opposite of a fluke.<br>  <br>  Edit:  99 out of 100 doctors would give you the same answer -"This is serious enough to see a Doctor, not try to figure it out at home without enough medical background to thoroghly understand long technical answers."  I didn't mean 100 out of 100 doctors would say you have diabetes just by the symptoms you gave, alone.  Actually, almost any doctor would resist giing an actual diagnosis over the phone.|`|HHOy50Zyaa	See your doctor and get a blood test.  Self-diagnosing something like that is not recommended.  I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and I had no symptoms (still don't), not particularly overweight, and no family history o diabetes.  My doc picked it up in a routine fasting blood test, and followed that up with a glucose tolerance test to double-check.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	100 out of 100 doctors would not offer you the same opinion given your symptoms as one reader suggested.  I do not know what age 'pretty young' is.  If you are less than 12 and it turns out that you have diabetes it will be type 1.  I have seen type 2 diabetes in adolescents as young as 12 years old.  Medicine is a bit more complicated than people understand.  The 'classic' symptoms of diabetes are polyphagia (increased hunger), polydipsia (increased thirst), and polyuria (increased urination).  The term classic is an old one and does not imply that this triad is the typical presentation of diabetes.  In point of fact most diabetic patients do not present in this fashion.  Blurred vision occurs only if the glucose (blood sugar) is significantly elevated.  Numbness of the hands is unlikely indicative of diabetes.  Diabetes may lead to neuropathy (nerve damage) and sometimes this is the initial symptom but diabetic neuropathy almost always begins in the feet not the hands.  Diabetes has a strong genetic component.  For type 1 diabetes the specific gene has been identified.  In studies of twins if one twin develops type 1 diabetes there is a 50% likelihood that the other twin will develop type 1 diabetes.  The genetics of type 2 diabetes are stronger but no specific gene has been identified.  The lack of a family history casts doubt of the possibility that you have diabetes.  As one respondent said the easiest way to determine whether or not you have diabetes is to contact a relative or a friend who has diabetes as they will have a glucometer.  A fasting glucose in a non-diabetic will be between 70 and 100 mg/dL (3.9 to 5.6 mmol/L - the US is the only country which insists on using its own laboratory values).  If your fasting glucose is within that range then the likelihood of diabetes would be essentially zero.  If the fasting glucose is over 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) it does not by itself make the diagnosis of diabetes.  If the fasting glucose is above this value however you should make the trip to see your physician.  They are likely to repeat the fasting glucose and may order a glycated hemoglobin A1C (as one respondent suggested).  The popularity of glucose tolerance testing has waxed and waned over the last 4 decades.  I have never ordered one.  It is easy to make the diagnosis with the GTT, the GTT is seldom performed correctly, and there is considerable disagreement as to how to interpret the results.  My summary is this:  1 you probably do not have diabetes, 2 you should have a fasting glucose done, and 3 if the fasting glucose is above the values given above then you most definitely should visit your physician for a more definitive diagnosis.  I will caution you that terms such as 'borderline diabetic', 'pre-diabetic', and 'glucose intolerance' are often used by physicians when in fact all 3 of these diagnoses indicate 'early diabetes' which should be decisively treated.  Physicians who use these diagnoses have missed the point of the pathophysiologic changes leading up to an elevated glucose.  There is typically a 10 year period of damage prior to the glucose becoming elevated so if the glucose is elevated prompt intervention is essential.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|cQJGaUK4aa	You really need to go to the Doctor ASAP, this is nothing to let go, I have type2 diabetes, it's in both sides of my family BUT it does not have to be in your family for you to have diabetes, it just means you have a greater chance of getting it if it is in your family.<br>  You can go to Wal-Mart and get a cheap machine and strips but since you are really thirsty all the time and are uriniating alot then you need to be checked out.<br>  I don't want to scare you any more than you are but please go to the Doctor.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	When in doubt - check it out!  Better to be safe than sorry. And if you are diabetic, getting treatment earlier is better. There could be something else going on too. And diabetes does run in families, so you have a plus there, but it doesn't mean that you can't have it.

Hvp96yKzaa	Well it hurts and your skin will peel if your in the sun for much too long. I've never had severe sunburn but I've seen it. It feels like a tingly painful sensation and it burns a little as well. Splashing cold water on it will relax the burning sensation and the pain)<br>  <br>  I suggest SPF 50 (well it depends on the UV index but you can never be too safe) if you know you'll be in the sun for a long time. You should apply sunblock after being in water or intense perspiration (sweat). Be sure you buy water proof sunblock because you will probably be sweating.|`|S1YTA8Feaa	its just that your skin feels really dry and hot, and its not all over your body, just where you got burned. it can blister and peel if you get burned enough. if your a light skinned black person you can get it but you would have to be in the sun for a good minute lol and yeah sunblock should be enough, just re-apply after swimming and around where your clothes/bathing suit or whatever rubs... just remember that you dont have to get burned to increase your risk of skin cancer, all you need is sun exposure. so even though you prolly wont get burned the sunscreen is still a good idea :)|`|PogMq7Pcaa	ouchie

The actual menstral cycle doesn't start til you are 17-18 years old and THAT is when you start growing hips. I'm almost 18 and my hips just started getting wider. That's also when I developed a disease called endometriosis. When I asked the gynechologist why it's happening just now and not when I first started at age 12 she told me it's because an actual womans menstruation doesn't start til 17-18 years of age. That's when the real body changes happen like the widening of the hips. It's a child-bearing age where your body gets ready to be fertile and conceive. :)|`|AA12073051	your hips are already big! you have to wait for your hips to open up.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	Theres no way of changing your bone structure sorry.

Your chance of living depends on what kind of cancer you have, how big the tumor is, how well-differentiated the tumor is, if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and if the cancer has spread to anywhere else.<br>  <br>  There is no one way to tell you have cancer, because there are literally hundreds of kinds of cancers.  The symptoms depend on the location of the tumor.  Some generic constitutional symptoms that go along with multiple cancers are fatigue, weight loss, increased sweating at night, pain in bones and joints, etc.<br>  <br>  If you have a specific cancer in mind, edit your question and I can try to tell you some specific symptoms of that cancer.|`|v5sZUSD0aa	It depends what kind of cancer you have, which is determined by where the cancerous cells are growing and or spreading (metastisizing)|`|VP7A10bXaa	most have no symptoms, but every type of cancer is different.

Sb1skvHBaa	i know this may be mean but you are really not helping anyone posting your anorexic questions all the time. kid yourself as much as you wnt but you are not in recovery , you don't wanna gain weight that badly because you lost it! when i recovered it was as hard as hell but i gained weight steadily , i binged quite a bit which i regret but still i actually wanted to recover so i forced myself to eat more and eventually the anorexic voice got weaker. you are on here all the time and you know what your questions make me feel crap about myself and my recovery , when you just faking it and posting questions about your stupidly small calorie intake and 2 hour workouts ! and then you say that is recovery , when what other recovering anorexics do is really hard - they stop the exercise and maybe just tone and eat 3000 cals a day spread out ! its so hard and you aren't even making an effort <br>  and that's fine by me ( if you wanna die) but stop posting these questions as they are getting my head in and im sure cant be helping  other recovering anorexics! <br>  and don't tell me ," what im doing is so much better than before, i eat 300 cals more now and exercise for 10 minutes less" because iv heard it all before and all your doing is kidding yourself. if you really wanna get better and you cant do it yourself then get yourself into a clinic now! but if you think you can fight then fight NOW!!!|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	its doubtful that you ate enough calorie wise, especially with a two hour workout, however your choices kinda sucked.  chocolate bar for lunch?  minimal protein, bad sugars, little to no nutritional value, hopefully it was dark so you got some antioxidants.  one scoop of ice cream would be a good indulgence after a well rounded day, but your day wasn't veyr well rounded. so you deprived oyurself of adequate calories, and adequate nutrients.  track calories in and out as well as nutrional info on a site like caloriecount.about.com or fitday.com|`|4CsGde1qaa	What you ate were okay, but I;ll tell you what I ate today if it makes you feel better.

We need to learn 3 definitions: the volume of calories in our food, the volume of calories a certain activity burns each hour, and last but not least our own personal daily allowance of calories.

NuUMDTrTaa	At your age, if you eat properly, there is absolutely no need for extra vitamins.<br>  One caplet is possibly not harmful, but depending on your overall diet they could give you too much of any one of the vitamins or minerals, and that can cause problems, depending on which  vitamin or mineral it is.|`|EobQv52saa	Taking a multivitamin every day is a good idea even at your age. Eating the right foods is always the best choice but that's tough to do all the time and the multivitamins are a great way to fill the gap. There are some supplements that you don't want to take every day or you wouldn't want to take in concentrated amounts. Iron pills are an example because they will cause an extremely upset stomach. Another example is too much calcium since men don't usually need much and there are concerns that it can crystalize within the body. The great part about vitamins and minerals is that if you get too much (within reason such as the amount provided in a multivitamin) the body can't absorb the excess and flushes it out when you urinate. Drink several glasses of water each day to help your system flush any excess if you feel concerned. Water helps keep your skin clear and flushes impurities within your body as well and is an overall healthy and easy thing to do along with taking your vitamin.|`|KEYDBrpNaa	If you are in overall good health and eat a well balanced diet, you don't need to take vitamins at all.  You get all the vitamins you need from foods, the sun, and your own body.  Too many vitamins in your system can be toxic (more so from fat-soluble vitamins because they stay in your body longer than water soluble vitamins).  Consult with your health care provider and ask for some bloodwork so you can have peace of mind.

You might consider starting with your GP and go from there with hormone testing, and blood work and a few things along those lines. Bi Polar will not get better on it's own and in my experience both phases are very destructive. During the manic phases I have seen women, have sex with just anyone, gamble, spend money more than usual, start using drugs/alcohol, general risky behaviors, poor judgement, etc. Obviously during the depressed phase there is sleeping all the time, no goals, jobs are lost (due to no motivation)anxiety, guilt, fatigue, chronic pain, and concentration issues. Which obviously you appear to have many of these.  Bi polar can be caused by biochemical imbalance, genes, and environment. Also family history can be a factors.<br>  There are many good sites on Ask.com about Bi Polar with some of them being NAMI.org- DBSAlliance.org and WebMD.com. God Bless REGGIE<br>  There are many good medications and counselors out there that can help you get stabilized with this issue.

5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	you dont really need to diet, just eat a little less. <br>  also try cardio to burn fat. run fast for say 4x200m to get rid of the glycogen from the muscles, and get all the other bonuses HIIT training gives, after that do slow cardio for 30 minutes, or upto 50 mintues for fat loss. you can also swim, that works as well. .<br>  <br>  also muscles will burn more fat than cardio in the long run,(long run being the other 23 hours of the day) so build some muscles. <br>  if you dont have any equipment, do push-ups, crunches, oblique twists, reverse curls, squats. <br>  if you have access to dumbells, do bicep curls at least, you can use them for jsut about everything., <br>  if you have access to a gym ask someone who knows what their doing, or a trainer, they'll prolly show you how to do it, and help you ge tthe right form as well.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	if you don't want to diet than you ha dbetter be ready to RUN RUN RUN and RUN some more. execise enough and you can eat what you want and still lose weight, but no berry or belt or pill will do it while you sit on the couch with a donut.|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	Unfortunately yes, the only way to get rid of (permanently) that "flab" is to lower you caloric intake, especially your fats, and carbohydrates. = Diet. There are many methods that swear they can remove that extra flab, but all they actually do is remove water from the area, which will reduce the surface area/volume. This is only temporary. <br>  <br>  - I feel your pain though.|`|0gvpklkIaa	exercise
UsiD5toOaa	Your supposed to never have cavities again.
eZDYXqKWaa	I always feel like this after two weeks of dieting... <br>  The motivation I felt when I started the diet (again..) just somehow died down and I feel like, mm, I made a bit of progress, but the progress is so slow, will I really make it to the end?<br>  <br>  Well, I know that dieting takes a long time, isn't instant, but you know, we get weak when it gets to fatty foods<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work, and remember that it's ok to eat a bit of fatty foods, just eat it in moderation. good luck!|`|bOhvvbUIaa	I think you just need to get serious about not eating fatty foods, eat a healthy diet and exercise. just dieting wont cut it. instead of eating fatty foods when your getting a urge or whatever eat a salad or some fruit or even a bowl of raisin brand.<br>  its all good|`|zZPEoSngaa	Definatly!UGGG I hate that!|`|CKMH0tloaa	You may feel a little horrible, but afterwards you feel and look great!|`|MF9YknDYaa	1)It's one reason why eating less will not work in the long term<br>  2)most fat people have been dieting off and on for years<br>  3)going hungry is just the worst thing and the body(and brain)will rebel.|`|COrM1SQdaa	Actually, you don't have to diet as such to lose weight, the only method that definitely delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 20 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
sZ1xbQXlaa	yes ,the same thing happened with me and no one knows why, massaging does prevent them but massage with lotion! use anythinng with coco buuter/shea butter. lotions with vitamins c e d and a also help and theres also cheap lotions specially for stretch marks at walkmart or something. mine are practically gone! and do this before its too late bc its easier to get rid of them in there initial/early stages|`|dALX1qQdaa	not really<br>  use palmer's lotion|`|e5543e7d44e54e5a2ba736ec70b75019aa	yeahhh your body are grow and changed shapes. When you take a shower after use lotion put all your body and face. If you use everyday and your face would look more younger when you turn old woman. I use the lotion for 22 years - never stopped. trust me. if dont use lotion very much will cause stretch marks.|`|mgdkr6hvaa	your boobs are problably just growing quickly, it's happened to me too.  <br>  Sry but i don't know anything to prevent it, but i personally am not self consiese about it. don't worry about it.|`|TCFX0S5oaa	with time your stretch marks will disapear, but also there are lotions and creams that can help alot. Also ask your doctor. I think vitamin E helps also.|`|eCKNRcIVaa	That is common when your breasts are developing.  It has nothing to do with being overweight.|`|Ww6FyRwCaa	Stretch marks will show up whenever there is quick gain of size in most parts of your body.  Unfortunately, they seem to develop mostly in women.  You've probably heard of them for pregnant women.  They can happen most anywhere your body will put on weight quickly.<br>  <br>  As you are still growing, it is possible your breasts are still growing, even if you aren't gaining weight.<br>  <br>  Basically, there is nothing you can do about it.  Once they are there, they are there for life.  <br>  <br>  There are all sorts of companies out there who will try to sell you something to get rid of the marks...nothing has ever worked.  It is just a waste of money.  There are some medical resources out there that will tel you the same thing.  I don't have them off hand, but I'm sure you could google it.|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	once you have them they never go away. they show up when there has been too much growth in a short period of time and the skin didnt have enough elasticity to keep up. they are scars. sometimes keeping the skin moisturized can help prevent new ones. but some people are just more prone to have them. it may be just the way you are. dont feel bad.... most women do have them in one place or another. other common areas are hips and belly|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Stretch marks are caused by hormones, and unfortunately, there really isn't anything you can do about it.  Some people just get them, and some don't.  I had them too as a young person, even before your age.  I hate them too.  ;)|`|M8B2i69gaa	Use Palmer's Cocoa Butter Formula (or it's called "tummy butter for stretch marks"). Most girls get stretch marks on their boobs. Just wear a good bra and put on the cocoa butter daily.<br>  <br>  You're far from overweight, by the way.|`|AA11820571	There may be stretch marks because your body is still growing. I wouldn't worry about it. At that weight, you sound like you are NOT over weight at all.|`|spRtQKaWaa	They're like racing stripes. Racing stripes are cool.|`|diAqosiIaa	no just put coco butter but the marks mean that they are growing and nothing is wrong with that|`|Uigfp5uOaa	cocoa butter
jlbMKE1vaa	no i think your eyes just dry out and you just can't do it anymore. your body will continue to produce tears no matter what. but your mind will tell you your exhausted from tears|`|1Ec5Ntw7aa	I just get so exhausted I fall asleep. :( <br>  I don't think your body could run out of water to produce tears. It'll just get too tiring. You'll be okay I promise. :) Cheer up buttercup. :)|`|6BZTX1NCaa	heck no! our body is 70% water, there is no way we can run out of tears it is physically impossible, that is a stupid question man
oncDS4FKaa	Are you wet enough when having sex...sometimes that sensation will happen when you are dry during sex and hurts upon urination.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Unfortunately, just because you were virgins before marriage, doesn't mean that you are the only person your hubby has been with. I'm not saying he IS cheating, but it's better safe than sorry. Get tested!<br>  <br>  I highly recommend going to a doctor, because burning sensations while peeing is a red flag.<br>  <br>  Also- ALWAYS pee after you have sex, right away, as all that thrusting can lodge bacteria into your urethra and cause infection.|`|ISHIDwawaa	Sometimes one person can get a natural growth of bacteria that is benign, then during sex the partner's immunity might not be able to handle this bacteria and will cause a UTI.<br>  <br>  Anal sex will cause a UTI as the anal sex gets the penis dirty and it then gets on the vagina, this is why when doing anal sex you should use a condom and change out the condom before going in the vagina.|`|Y4s4Om38aa	Could be a UTI starting and your body taking care of it and not letting it become a full bladder infection.  Or maybe just could be irritation. Like if you were a little dry and either scratched or rubbed a spot wrong and made it sore, could be that irritation burns when you urinate.  I have done that before from masturbating|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	Just be safe and ask the doctor. Sometimes if I had sex and it was a little to rough I would burn a little. Are you using a lubricant? That can help also. If you are using a lubricant make sure it is not irritating to you same goes for condoms or anything else you may be using during sex.|`|Uh029jJmaa	It's really important to use the restroom before and AFTER sex.  My doctor told me that it can cause UTI.  I think if you think you are dehydrated, GO TO THE DOCTOR.  That's serious but, since you have it EVERY TIME you have sex I doubt its dehydration.|`|AA10975334	It is best to see a doctor. You could have a bladder or a vaginal infection.|`|vb0FO6k0aa	see a doctor|`|V2yZJWy5aa	THIS MEAN YOU ARE NEW TO THIS THINGS YOU WILL BE ALRIGHT, IF GETTING WORST SEE YOUR DOC|`|grPckwSsaa	yeah... that doesnt sound good.<br>  <br>  <br>  doctor time!|`|MbSSIOpSaa	Wow. Burning lasting a few days sounds like it could be an infection or something serious, and is definitely not normal. I would recommend seeing your doctor very soon and get it checked out :)|`|f7aab70787ab67cae31928e52eab498baa	No its not STD.It may be that you have chronic UTI. Get yourself tested for urine test and also a vaginal swab test for yeast infection the chances of which is there.Also must have enough lubrication before your husband penetrates otherwise friction to the vagina can lead to some mucosal injury wnd thus there may be pain when you urinate.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	How long have you been married?  Lots of women get a bladder infection when they first start having sex due to the bladder being rubbed from the inside during sex.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water, but you may also need to see a doctor.|`|kep1iGHpaa	Text book symptom of an STD. <br>  Go to the doctor.|`|oxsawg31aa	Are u using condoms? Could it be that ur allergic to latex? Just a thought
tIldpr7vaa	like i said its all about portion control<br>  <br>  any meal in huge portions its gunna be high in calories<br>  <br>  but basically any meal in small portions is gunna be low cal<br>  <br>  But for an averaged sized meal, the greasier some thing is the higher the cals will be, like anything fried<br>  <br>  *If ur looking to gain weight, best thing to do is just to eat alot of healthy foods, not pig out on high cal junk food.<br>  <br>  But u need to lift weights to gain muscle. If u just over eat with out working out, ur just gunna gain fat, u know this right?
J18K52Wtaa	I think you are just having some stress, we all have that from time to time.  Just stop what you are doing--quit taking those freezing cold showers-relax with a nice cuppa tea with some honey and get a good nights sleep and you will be fine.<br>  Hope that helped.|`|ON0tg9CMaa	WHEN THEY COME ON, IT MIGHT BE YOU'VE BEEN STUDING TO LONG.

Do this off and on.  Or ice it.  I've read that a vein there is associated with the ones that cause headaches or menstrual cramps.  When you do that, it distracts the pain. <br>  <br>  Or...<br>  <br>  Massage your temples and/or scalp where there's pain and that's kind of soothing.  Don't chew gum or smoke. Um... I'm trying to think of what else the Doctor's Book of Home Remedies said for headaches.<br>  <br>  If you have time, check them out.  Best book ever!  My mom had the books, and I read them too much! lol  <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|JPfraSk9aa	Take the music out of your ears.  Lie down in a dark room for a good nights sleep.  Don't worry because that wil still be there in the morning.  Worrying is not the way out.  Avoid coffee, cokes and caffeine.  Have some chicken soup and rest  rest  rest on a nice soft pillow.<br>  God Bless  <br>  Stay Well|`|JAR0e43uaa	Try to relak ur muscles
VQlXF8Ucaa	It will eventually go away.  You didn't say whether or not it was blistered.  They make this stuff called Silvadine Cream and that works really good on burns.

It depends on what kind of exercises you are doing.
VB3ZK5f9aa	Did you select the Diabetes section or did Y!A?  <br>  <br>  Because you're in the right section.  Those are some indications a person *might* have diabetes.  You need to write down these symptoms and see a doctor.  A simple blood test or two will tell if you have a problem with diabetes.  (When you make the appointment, ask if you should fast before the appointment, and for how long.)<br>  <br>  The teen years are when certain diabetes cases show up.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Those are some symptoms of being diabetic. There are others as well like increased urination, weight loss/gain, insomnia, headache, dizziness, and sweating when there is no reason to be sweating. You should go to the doctor and have them check it out. If it is too low, you could go into diabetic coma called insulin shock. Or if it is too high you can go into coma from too much sugar in your blood.|`|4onT0qUxaa	If these symptoms are bothersome for you, and it sounds like they are, see your Dr. He can find a treatment plan for each of these, even if it is not Diabetes.|`|AA12400627	Those are symptoms my mom gets and she is diabetic....|`|ztzEloj5aa	it sounds like you need more iron- try taking iron supplements or eating more red meat.|`|rMhJceVuaa	sounds like anemia or diabetes you should probably go to the doctor|`|cQJGaUK4aa	These are symptoms of diabetes BUT it doesn't mean you have diabetes.<br>  The best thing for you to do is go to the doctor, get the tests run and don't put it off, this is something you don't want to ignore.<br>  I have been a diabetic for 20 years and I didn't have any symptoms, they found it during a check up..so please go|`|AA10832514	You need to see a doctor.  That's going on too long.  Could very well be diabetes.  You'd need a glucose tolerance test for sure.  Your doctor can do a preliminary blood test to check your A1C sugars to see the levels.  He/She may also want to check your blood with a simple blood meter in the office.  Good luck, but don't put it off any longer.|`|wNtBzGGYaa	ok this is happening to me 2. im 13 I think de-hydration and mal-nuratashment(however you spell that).|`|qjEx8esgaa	you should go to the doctor, it sounds like you have some symptoms of hemophilia but idk|`|q6TSRzr7aa	you just think about things and they sometimes become physical<br>  it starts as being physiologic|`|llNlE0Rkaa	Babe u should go doctor then they can examine u properly not on the internet!!<br>  the tiredness might be something to do with being anemic (not gettin enuff iron)<br>  or sumthing to do with ur glands forgot what its called i onli no cos of family!<br>  tingliness might be ur blood not flowing to ur feet and hands.. like pins and needles... ooor if u go out in the cold then come into the heat or cold feet in hot water (which isnt good btw)<br>  the others i dunoo babe...<br>  i mean im NOT a doctor im jus thinkin of stuff i no but could be completely different...<br>  have u told ur parent/carer??<br>  u shud go doctors babe :) take care xox
VOllnlKXaa	My elbows do the same thing. I think it's completely normal... Just that your elbows were squished in an uncomfortable position for too long, that's all.|`|PImvmP1paa	It's because you have your elbows bent for too long then they're supposed to be.
RCfc9hMKaa	That's normal... A lot of women like Lesbian porn because the videos are more sensual and gentle. A lot of straight porn looks uncomfortable and very unattractive (I really need a porn star to explain why they wear that much lip liner, my god) and doesn't appeal to women. We know by looking at it that it wouldn't be pleasurable and she's faking it to get paid.|`|k86KdyYOaa	You're totally normal.<br>  This is just your way of pleasuring yourself, it does not make you bi-sexual or a lesbian at all.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Not a problem for me.  We could watch together.  (I'm a guy.)|`|W6LGsQC8aa	You are normal!<br>  <br>  Women are sexual beings, too.. not just men. Just because you watch lesbian porn does not mean you are a lesbian. Women in porn are attractive, plain and simple (why do you think it sells so well?). Typically, men in porn are not attractive. Who wouldn't be turned on seeing two attractive people (regardless of gender) get off?<br>  <br>  Keep up the good work! Few women know what gets them off, so you are ahead of the game.|`|TiN0pZjOaa	it's not a problem, everyone has their own way for pleasuring themselves.

They said that people use Mountain Dew to calm themselves or something. So it's kind of the same as drugs in a way. Why do people spend so much money on drugs? Cause it's helps them or makes them feel good.
N89HLv92aa	My side effects from it was a decrease in sexual desire, a 5lb weight gain (not much to worry about), night mares, and fatigue. <br>  I have learned to manage the fatigue symptom by taking my meds at night instead of in the morning.   It does work very well. I am taking 10mg which is a low dose. Mostly it has helped me keep the edge off. I use to want to snap at people for little things but lexapro has helped me not to do that and not to worry as much. Good Luck and God Bless!!|`|RzaVCA2Yaa	it is an SSRI, meaning it is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. here is what that means:<br>  <br>  serotonin is the brain chemical that makes you happy. your body makes it throughout the day, and stores it in brain cells. it releases it little by little and the more of it is outside brain cells and inside the connections between the cells, the happier you get, and takes some of what it releases back, so it can be re-used later on. an SSRI prevents your body from taking back a portion of the serotonin, so there is more of it between the connections (called synapses), so you become happier. here is a list of possible side effects:<br>  <br>  nausea<br>  sleepyness/drowsyness<br>  headaches<br>  some sexual side effects, mostly for men (they cant finish as fast)<br>  less common ones are:<br>  photosesitivity (you get sunburnt easily)<br>  weight change.<br>  <br>  in teenagers and young adults (so basically from 13-30ish) it may cause thoughts of suicide.<br>  <br>  <br>  it has an adaptation phase, which is when your body starts to get used to taking lexapro, usually most side effects go away after the adaptation phase, which usually lasts around 2-4 weeks.
N89HLv92aa	I gained about 4 or 5 lbs., not enought to make me stop taking it. Also, I did not ever break out from taking lexapro, but I wouldnt think it would make you break out. Break outs are often caused from stress, and Lexapro helps calm stress, so maybe it will actually help reduce breakouts!|`|7898bed61433434531784bc3ff2ec3e9aa	I can't speak for others but when I took it I lost weight and did not break out.  However I forgot to drink any fluids and became dehydrated, manic and almost went nuts with withdraw.  If you have a choice not to take it and try another please do, Lexapro is Hell to quit and you shouldn't plan on taking it long term anyways.  <br>  Good luck.|`|uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) with dinner, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.<br>   <br>  The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.<br>   <br>  The last time I was in the doctor office, I had lost 8 lbs - not a lot, but in the right direction.  I give the Wellbutrin SR the credit for the weight loss, since it does help me to be more active.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Although you can't assume what happened to someone else will happen to you - everyone responds different to medications - but I love Lexapro. I have had no problems with any side effects and have had complete relief from anxiety and depression with a very low dose (10 mg a day).<br>  When it's time to stop taking it you have to ween yourself off very slowly under a doctor's care - if you do that there should be no problems quiting when the time comes - it's the same with any anti-depressant.
1KqknaUHaa	Stretch Marks.<br>  <br>  They're from gaining weight or losing weight really fast.<br>  Get some cocoa butter lotion to moisturize your skin really well so it won't happen as much and the lotion will also help minimize the appearance, but sadly you can't get rid of them.<br>  <br>  Just watch your diet I guess & use lotion!
BThdUonXaa	i think that you are fine, and if the bump is getting smaller, then you are on the right track. if you start having other symptoms, then get to a doctor.|`|UV6K1mqtaa	Well, it will go down in a few days. It is sore from being smashed! :) I would reccommend putting ice on it. That will relieve pain and reduce swelling. It is the only way to get the swelling to go down.

iL1tYfJMaa	that's nothing odd or unusual.|`|KC5vBg4uaa	I got paranoid my first time, but not as bad as you described.<br>  <br>  Anyway though, it's like a slippery slope with weed.  Once you start getting paranoid, you start getting paranoid about your paranoia, and unless you have something or someone to calm you down soon enough you will be very paranoid.  Just try not to smoke so much next time and if you start getting paranoid, just try to relax.|`|j6VRLlhjaa	Was it laced??|`|UcyrBNfYaa	sounds like my first time.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	lol<br>  <br>  It's called getting high.|`|bRkq4JH0aa	pot does that to you XD|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	Well that's what you get for smoking weed.
a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	You just have to change your mind every time you think of smoking. Go for a walk, drink a glass of water, get up and do something else...just get your mind off of the cigarette. Keep saying to yourself "I am a non-smoker".  This technique worked for me. It was hard, I'm not going to kid you, but you can do it if you really want to. <br>  I don't smoke in the house, so I stayed in the house a lot. I went to the movies, etc. Places where I couldn't smoke. And I didn't have any cigarettes around. <br>  Good luck to you.|`|h4IWXPNoaa	I got on chantix and it worked it took a month of it but most use a 3 month supply I havent smoked in 6 months and feel no craving to do it again.

pQWZNafqaa	i thought of this question once, and deeply researched it.<br>  basically what it is, is inside the iris (colored part) of your eye, there are proteins. these proteins determine the eyes color. all people of all races initially have blue eyes when they are born, but they change usually within a few hours.<br>  <br>  so anyway, the color proteins are yellow, green, and blue I beleive if I remember correctly. the brown happens when there is a mixture of all the colors together (like mixing many colors of paint together). one of the people whom i read about while doing this research started out with bright blue eyes then halfway through their life they changed to brown, and finally they ended up with bright green. very interesting.<br>  <br>  also, going out in the sun helps to darken the color of the eyes, just like skin. it doesnt happen as quickly as it does with skin and melanin.|`|ZmadA59Caa	Mine Change Now at 17.

4uike3ARaa	There is a difference, both physiologically and mentally/emotionally. A barrier of latex (or whatever) between you, however thin, reduces the physiological stimulation, ie, the physical sensations. More for him than for you. (One reason guys don't like to wear condoms)<br>  As for the breaking the rules aspect, the emotional/mental aspect of making love, that's going to be different for every person.<br>  But, to answer your question...yes, it feels better. Or at least, I seem to remember that it did!  :-)|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Yes it does feel better especially if you have been using cheap condoms that are a bit thicker.  However, it isn't worth it to have a kid you don't want.  And guess what.. you NEED to be worried about pregnancy. Pulling 'way out' has nothing to do with it.  The man does not have to ejaculate in order for you to get pregnant.

It is even better for him if he hasn't had much of his sexual sensitivity destroyed by circumcision, which always damages the penis.<br>  <br>  There is a big risk of both pregnancy and STDs without a condom.

EDXh0tk9aa	Totally normal.<br>  <br>  Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to you than to others. <br>  <br>  Even after you have regular periods, it will continue. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you. Some girls do produce more discharge than others. <br>  <br>  You discharge is effected by diet, water intake, exercise, meds and illness.<br>  <br>  Different Types of Discharge:<br>  <br>  White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.<br>  <br>  Different types of infections:<br>  <br>  Signs of yeast infections:<br>  White, cottage cheese-like discharge <br>  Swelling and pain around the vulva <br>  Intense itching <br>  <br>  Signs of bacterial vaginosis:<br>  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge <br>  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap <br>  Itching or burning <br>  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva|`|velIdcbNaa	Don't loose your head!!!!!!!! it is natural.

It happens to all females so you aren't alone.|`|M8B2i69gaa	That's called vaginal discharge, and all girls get it. It usually revolves around your period. It usually doesn't smell or even soak through anything, because it's too thin and goopy, and it dries (though it eventually gets a smell if there's a lot because of the bacteria that gets onto it).<br>  <br>  There's nothing you can do to stop it from coming out (that I know of). You could wear panty liner if you're paranoid about it.<br>  <br>  The only case to be worried is if it initially smells bad and has a color (other than clear or slightly yellow).|`|nBKSMnTSaa	This is just normal discharge that comes out of your body, often times warning you that you're going to get your period.

If you seriously pedal, and not just sit on the bike and coast every chance you get, you'll have gorgeous thighs, hips, abs, and calves by April 18th.  But, if you don't have good weather, and if you're not committed to exercise, well, forget it.  You may not have a good enough bike and that would cost you a few hundred dollars, and you'd need some of those lycra shorts and bike shoes, so, it may not be worth it to you.  Like I said, I was a VERY AVID bicyclist for around 25 years, and Ioved it just because I could be out in the wind, feeling that "freedom" that most people think can only happen on motorcycles, and I could eat like a PIG, and all the stuff I liked too, and still be extremely healthy and very nice looking.

You can just sit in your bed or on the floor and do these. Also try some leg lifts or dolphin kicks. For the thighs, try doing a lot of squats, lunges, and run. Don't run so much that you put a lot of stress on your joints, however. Running is good for you, but in the long run (no pun intended) it can hurt you if you do something wrong.

TsjqzanQaa	No, steroids do not cause smegma.<br>  <br>  Smegma is a much-maligned substance that's naturally produced by male and female genitals.    Yes, females have it, also.<br>  <br>  They are a combination of secretions of the mucosal tissues of the inner foreskin and sloughed-off skin cells.<br>  <br>  The word "smegma" derives from the Greek word meaning soap.<br>  <br>  Smegma is normally produced by males around the time they reach puberty.      Infants and toddlers don't produce it, which is why infant' and toddlers' foreskins don't need to be retracted to be cleaned, and this premature retraction can frequently result in phimosis.<br>  <br>  Be careful when washing your penis.    Harsh soaps, especially the antibacterial ones can cause irritation and dry out the tissues.<br>  <br>  The foreskin has antiviral and antibacterial properties which have only been recently discovered, which are the result of Langerhans cells.      That's why males who are circumcised have a much higher rate of HIV and other infections, contrary to the old wive's tales.<br>  <br>  The hypersensitivity of your glans will diminish as you retract the foreskin daily for short periods, and it gets acclimatized to exposure and touch.<br>  <br>  Try to expose the gently handle the glans daily, several times per day and within a month or two you'll notice a difference.<br>  <br>  You're lucky to have a foreskin, which is a necessary part of the penis so that you can experience a 100% complete sexual experience.<br>  <br>  A partial, mutilated and scarred penis from circumcision obviously doesn't feel or function as well as a complete penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	Probably pearly penile papules -- look that up -- the pictures will tell you whether it is that or not.<br>  <br>  No, it does not cause smegma, and I very much doubt (though do not know) that it is that.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|pgRUuPJsaa	Are you using the cream at the tip of the glans? The cream could enter the foreskin there, and will collect there to make these "little white balls" appear around the head. It could be mixed in with smegma, or just the cream itself. Don't worry though, it's nothing you should be worried about; just make sure you wash it out once in a while!|`|QBUypAmAaa	Those balls are more than likely smegma like you thought.

vb0FO6k0aa	Count to 10, before you speak. Simple it may sound, but this age-old advice does work. But when you are angry, it may seem to be the hardest tip of all. With the adrenaline flowing and the blood starting to boil, it takes a real effort of willpower to do it. But do try and try hard, every time. But counting up to 10 before you open your mouth is rarely much good. To 50 is better. Some situations may need even 100!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	sometimes|`|Ov83HJEFaa	No, I don't think so.|`|b7ff0c6859d6ba5cc891050de578e39daa	Possibly, only a psychiatrist or psychologist can tell you for sure.  It is also possible that you just have to learn some self control.
BThdUonXaa	There are many types of burns.<br>  <br>      * Heat burns (thermal burns) are caused by fire, steam, hot objects, or hot liquids. Scald burns with hot liquid are the most common burns to children and older adults.<br>      * Electrical burns are caused by contact with electrical sources or by lightning.<br>      * Chemical burns are caused by contact with household or industrial chemicals in a liquid, solid, or gas form. Natural foods such as chili peppers, which contain a substance irritating to the skin, can cause a burning sensation.<br>      * Radiation burns are caused by the sun, tanning booths, sunlamps, X-rays, or radiation therapy for cancer treatment.<br>      * Friction burns are caused by contact with any hard surface such as roads ("road rash"), carpets, or gym floor surfaces. They are usually both a scrape (abrasion) and a heat burn. Friction burns to the skin are seen in athletes who fall on floors, courts, or tracks. Motorcycle or bicycle riders who have road accidents while not wearing protective clothing might get friction burns. For information on treatment for friction burns, see the topic Scrapes.<br>  <br>  Breathing in hot air or gases can cause injury your lungs (inhalation injuries). Breathing in toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide, can cause poisoning.<br>  <br>  Burns injure the skin layers and can also injure other parts of the body, such as muscles, nerves, lungs, and eyes. Burns are defined as first-, second-, third-, or fourth-degree, depending on how many layers of skin and tissue are burned. The deeper the burn and the larger the burned area, the more serious the burn is.<br>  <br>      * First-degree burns are burns of the first layer of skin. See an illustration of a first-degree burn.<br>      * There are two types of second-degree burns:<br>            o Superficial partial-thickness burns injure the first and second layers of skin. See an illustration of this type of second-degree burn.<br>            o Deep partial-thickness burns injure deeper skin layers. See an illustration of this type of deep second-degree burn.<br>      * Third-degree burns (full-thickness burns) injure all the skin layers and tissue under the skin. See an illustration of a third-degree burn.<br>      * Fourth-degree burns extend through the skin to injure muscle, ligaments, tendons, nerves, blood vessels, and bones. These burns always require medical treatment.<br>  <br>  The seriousness of a burn is determined by several factors, including:<br>  <br>      * The depth, size, cause, affected body area, age, and health of the burn victim.<br>      * Any other injuries that occurred, and the need for follow-up care.<br>  <br>  Burns affect people of all ages, though some are at higher risk than others.<br>  <br>      * About 20% of burns occur in children younger than age 5, and most of these are scald burns from hot liquids.<br>      * About 60% of burns occur in the 18- to 64-year-old age group.<br>      * About 10% of burns occur in older adults, mostly scald burns from hot liquids.<br>      * Men are twice as likely to have burn injuries as women.|`|vMthRkrsaa	rug, linoleum, asphalt<br>  <br>  not necessarily in that order|`|grm23kvjaa	1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree burns. first degree is like a sunburn, second goes deeper then the first layer of skin and third degree is thru all tissues/skin.

When you're 14 you think you're cool but when you grow up and look at young children through the eyes of an adult you just realise it's not cool and it just looks wrong.<br>  14 is young in my opinion and if you're older you come to your senses and may never smoke because you have a different mind frame and are no longer in high school and have the whole 'I want everyone to think I'm cool or hardcore'.|`|RdfMXlcmaa	look you're still a child.........well you need to let your lung to develop enough before taking in the carbon monoxide, but with your age it seems that your lung is still developing... if you had already started smoking... it is sure 100% that you're going to have lung cancer..........|`|73fuqfSyaa	18. when you are legally an adult you cant blame others for your decisions. you ARE too young, if you don't want to hear that you shouldn't have put your age up.

Its like you asking us if you should commit suicide, and then telling us that no matter what we say to you to try to convince you otherwise you will still commit suicide.<br>  <br>  I say SMOKE UP! and SMOKE LONG! When you finally croak from smoking (which hopefully won't be too long) your demise will save room on this over crowded planet. Just remember to tell your parents you want to be cremated so you body doesn't take up space in a grave.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	It's a law in Missouri that you can get arrested under the age of 18 for smoking or trying to buy it.|`|W1tx1p2iaa	Yes, we are all going to die but how you die is the question.  As you know smoking is correlated with COPD, empheysema and lung cancer.  People with these disease have a long slow death gasping for breath tied to an oxygen tank. Everyone I have worked with said if they only knew what smoking did (in their day, there was no surgeon general warnings) they would have not started. If you want to be a nurse, it will be hard for you to counsel patients on smoking cessation if you smoke and yes that will be part of your training if not the job you choose.

rhuhp6KCaa	No it definitely does not give you a orgasm, it definitely  will never get stuck, start out using the light instead of regular or super. Also try to start out when ur period is the lightest  and your feeling your best. <br>  <br>  Make sure you put it as far as it can go without discomfort. <br>  <br>  It might take a couple of tries but be patient and it would also help if you relax your body.  Don't be scared it wont hurt you.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VHaSKFC2aa	If you do it like it says on the sheet then you shouldn't feel it inside you at all really, because it will be far in. The first few times will probably be a bit uncomfortable, it might feel a little tight if you don't do it while you have your period since the cloth of it has a lot to hold onto and not enough liquid to easily pass through. Also, it might be harder to take out if you're not on your period since all the friction so you'll just have to wait a while :P (and no about the orgasm)|`|08Vk3RtJaa	there is nothing sexually exciting about inserting a tampon, it is just a part of feminine hygiene.  follow the instructions on the pack and don't panic if you can't get it right the first time, it can take a bit of practice before you may be able to use them properly.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	It doesn't feel like much of anything and when it is in you can't or shouldn't feel anything. Definitely no orgasm. It won't get stuck. Don't put one in unless you are on your period. It will hurt to pull it out if you aren't on your period.|`|kN0eajwbaa	It wouldn't give you an orgasm because that's from all of the thrusting and such. <br>  It feels a bit weird at first but it cannot get stuck. <br>  Try putting one in while you're not on (but on a big dischargy day) because you'll be less stressed then.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|grPckwSsaa	orgasm.... noooo<br>  <br>  <br>  you dont feel any pleasure at all... and if you put it in correctly, you really cant feel it at all<br>  <br>  its uncomfortable if it isnt pushed in far enough, but it doesnt hurt|`|PImvmP1paa	Most of the time, for me, it feels like something is in there that shouldn't be in there. Other times, it doesn't bother me.<br>  <br>  When tampons don't bother me is when I put them in a little further than what the directions say. The directions say to put it in until your fingers hit your skin, but I've found that it feels more comfortable for me when the tips of my fingers go into my opening a little bit.<br>  <br>  It doesn't give you an orgasm because there is no pleasure source in the vagina.<br>  <br>  It won't get stuck. If it feels like it is, most of the time your just pulling too hard, too fast, and not at the right angle to get it out.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	Honey, nothing the size of a tampon is going to get you off just by insertion.<br>  <br>  I ONLY wear tampons as I am an athlete and can't be bothered by bulky pads. Plus, who wants to sit in their own blood? Not me...<br>  <br>  Tampons will also NOT get stuck. They have a nifty string to pull it out, and the vagina will not allow the tampon to go in too far.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend switching to tampons.<br>  <br>  -they will not get lost in your vagina<br>  -they do not make you 'lose your virginity'<br>  -they will not make you orgasm<br>  <br>  They are just much easier and way more comfortable to use! I recommend a plastic applicator like tampax pearl...|`|oncDS4FKaa	Absolutely doesnt feel like an orgasm lol  and it definitely wont get stuck or lost.

You probably won't even notice that it is in. And it won't get stuck!
OgQ8opeAaa	It's called Dermabond (chemical name 2-octyl cyanoacrylate).  I don't use it to close "cuts," because a true cut is a dirty wound and I don't want a water-tight seal on that.  I do frequently use it in the OR after I have sutured a wound closed and I want a water tight dressing in lieu of gauze bandages.  Especially on head and neck incisions.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Totally works.  You have to clean the cut out really well first, which hurts.  But after that you can glue it together.  However, you need to use the kind they sell for that.  It comes in a tube with a q tip type thing.  I sliced the pad of my finger open nearly to the bone and we scrubbed it up and used the glue stuff on it.  It would have needed stiches, but it healed right up.  It left a scar but you can barely see it.

mqTsg05Taa	A psychiatrist is a trained medical doctor. They have been through medical schools, and then studied psychiatry as an additional area. Therefore they can prescribe any medications, such as anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. A psychiatrist is an expert in mental health and its treatment, although since mental health is such a wide area, many psychiatrists will specialise further for instance in child and adolescent psychiatry. Psychiatrists will generally be looking at mental health problems from a biological perspective.<br>  <br>  A psychologist usually has a degree in psychology. Often they will also have a PhD in psychology which means that they can all themselves "Doctor". While they might be a doctor of psychology, this is not to be confused with a medical doctor. Psychologists are not medically qualified, and therefore cannot prescribe medications. However, psychologists will be trained to help people with mental health problems by providing talking therapies, and other psychological treatments. Psychologists can also perform tests. Psychology is a wide field, and there are many variations between psychologists. However, they essentially study the mind, and look at non-biological factors behind mental health difficulties.<br>  <br>  A psychotherapist is a person who practices psychotherapy, which is a therapy coming from psychology. While they might be a psychiatrist or psychologist as well, they are often just people who are trained in psychotherapy, or could be nurses or social workers. There are various different types of psychotherapy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and psychoanalytic therapy to name a few.<br>  <br>  People with mental health difficulties will often have different healthcare professionals working with them. For instance they might have a psychiatrist to monitor their medication, and a psychologist or psychotherapist to provide them with therapy. All will provide distinct but overlapping roles in working towards the positive mental health of their patient/client.<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!|`|PkUPp4s0aa	psychiatrists are medical doctors. they can prescribe drugs. psychologists listen. psychotherapists are specialized...they look for deep-seeded issues.|`|qi6a30eIaa	Psychatrists are doctors, they are main-stream Medical Professionals who specialize in diagnosing Mental Illnesses, can legally prescribe  Medicines and are the final authority in diagnosis of a patient with Mental Disorder as such. <br>  <br>  Psychotherapists are paramedical professionals trained to assist the Doctors (Psychiatrists) in treatment of Mentally Ill patients, mainly by non-pharmacological means. <br>  <br>  Psychologists are the people who have a great deal of knowledge in Psychology, the study of the mind to put it simply; they need not necessarily be competent in the knowledge of Mental disorders and their treatment.
lTDeZ0Obaa	Zyrtec is an allergy medication, not a sleeping medication. It is to be used 10mg (one tablet) once daily. It can cause drowsiness because it is an antihistamine, but it is not for sleeping. It also is one of the newer allergy meds designed to cause less drowsiness than the older. You should NOT take 3 at a time, antihistamines can cause serious problems if you take too many. Even causing heart arrhythmia's and other health problems. You should NOT be taking any medication if you do not know what it is. If you just want an over-the-counter sleep aid get some Benadryl or diphenhydramine (the generic) version...take 25 to 50 mg at night. If this is not sufficient to help you sleep see a doctor for a prescription medication. Do not take more Benadryl as this is also an antihistamine.<br>  <br>  You can also try some other methods to get to sleep, as medications can be habit forming. Take a hot bath or shower to relax, do deep breathing exercises, drink some hot herbal tea (they make a Sweet Dreams or a Sleepy Time tea), drink some warm milk or hot chocolate, have a small snack of toast with peanut butter. Develop a regular bedtime routine, go to bed at the same time every night and do the same preparation for bed, so your body knows it's "bedtime" and gets ready. Also, having a regular sleeping and waking time, does help your body develop a regular sleep cycle without the need to depend on medications.<br>  <br>  Good luck & sweet dreams!

O2GRn8oOaa	yes you need to get monastat or the generic version you need the 7 day treatment it works|`|nBKSMnTSaa	This is a yeast infection. You need to get it treated from a doctor, all they do is look at your area and take your urine sample, then prescribe you to some medication. You cannot go out to the store and buy your own ointment, because there are factors that will make your problem worst. <br>  <br>  I have the same problem right now and I went to the doctors 4 days ago, and after eating the medicine I'm fine right now.  <br>  <br>  Women get yeast infections once or twice in their lifetimes, most likely during teenage years too. Some reasons why they get it is because of stress, sexual activities, or just being not clean enough down there. We have fungi in there, but being dirty over-produces the fungi causing the infection. I just went up to my mom and told her about it, and asked if I could see the doctor.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	If you think you have to tell her so she'll take you to a doctor, it's not really necessary because you can treat it on your own with over the counter creams like Monistat and plain yogurt (yogurt enzymes eat yeast so it will help... just make the yogurt has absolutely no sugar because yeast eats sugar and that would make it worse). I would try that first and if it gets unbearably itchy or doesn't start to clear up in a couple days, then tell her.

poeWy4YCaa	I know u know u can use a search engine.
Vj13f7zmaa	Yes you can.  However you can also get dead.  There is no 'dosing' as nutmeg varies widely in the strength.  Also, nutmeg highs last a very long time, sometimes for days, and you still have to deal with nasty side effects.  Anyway, it is very dangerous, not worth trying.|`|cilYUWgtaa	You can get high.... but... read this for more info<br>  <br>  NUTMEG<br>  <br>  Family:<br>      Myristicaceae <br>  Genus:<br>      Myristica <br>  Species:<br>      fragrans <br>  <br>  Usage:<br>  5-20 grams of ground nutmeg is ingested. Fresh ground is best. Can also be taken in a "space paste" concoction (see below). Space paste is difficult/expensive to make and tastes like ****; however, it may actually decrease the side effects.<br>  <br>  Effects:<br>  Possible nausea during first hour; may cause vomiting or diarrhea in isolated cases. Takes anywhere from one to five hours for effects to set in. Then expect severe cottonmouth, flushing of skin, severely bloodshot eyes, dilated pupils. Personally I compare it to a very, very heavy hash buzz. "Intense sedation". Impaired speech and motor functions. Hallucinations uncommon in average (5-10 gm) doses. Generally followed by long, deep, almost coma-like sleep (expect 16 hours of sleep afterward) and feelings of lethargy after sleep. May cause constipation, water retention. Safrole is carcinogenic and toxic to the liver.<br>  <br>  History:<br>  Nutmeg was a very important trade item in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was a precious commodity due to the enormous medicinal properties of its seeds. Slaves on the ships bringing nutmeg to Europe got in trouble for eating part of the cargo. They knew that a few large kernels of nutmeg would bring them a pleasant, euphoric feeling, and relieved their weariness and pain. Nutmeg was even used when the feeble King Charles II almost died of a clot or hemorrhage. His death a few days later did nothing to detract from its useful reputation. Rumor spread through London that Nutmegs could act as an abortifacient. The ladies who procured abortions from nutmeg were called "nutmeg ladies."<br>  <br>  Interaction precautions:<br>  MAO inhibitor<br>  <br>  Active Constituents:<br>  Methylenedioxy-substituted compounds: myristicin (non-amine precursor of 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine [M-MDA]) elemicin, and safrole.|`|fYbAS8xwaa	You can get high off of nutmeg but nobody does it because the side affects suck. You get an eerie feeling that someone else is always watching you, like a ghost. You also sweat a lot.<br>  <br>  So I would just stick to the weed, nutmeg is not that great at all.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Yes, you can get high off of nutmeg.  However, it makes you so sick, that I don't see why anyone tries it!  Search Google for <br>  <br>  nutmeg experience<br>  <br>  and you'll see how bad it is.<br>  <br>  If you want to get high, hyperventilate.  It is free, easy, harmless, and legal.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Don't do it. I've heard nothing but shitty things.<br>  <br>  Read this site for many peoples experiences on nutmeg (will also tell you how much they took):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/exp_Nutmeg.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.erowid.org/experiences/subs/e...</a>|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Yes, you can, but according to what I read the only reason why it's still legal is because people don't go back for seconds.  It's an almost guaranteed bad trip.<br>  <br>  But if you really do want to try it, 4-8 teaspoons is the dosage needed. And the high doesn't kick in for 5-7 hours after you ingest it and lasts over a day, so don't take more an hour later thinking it hasn't worked, and make sure you have a free schedule for the next two days.

WgIZUcYfaa	Yeah I would work there. I'd be helping people. Just because they preform abortions at some clinics does not mean that they are evil. They help out people who are in dire need of it. Not every woman on the planet used abortion as a form of birth control. Even if she did, it is her body and we need to respect what she wants to do with it.<br>  <br>  You either have legal abortion or have a bunch of kids on welfare or in foster care. To some people the last two options are "better", but most of those kids are not taken care of and contribute a lot to high crime rates.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I think everyone should have access to birth control.<br>  I think all women should have a choice as to their bodies.<br>  However, I DON'T think Plan B or abortions should be used as birth control even though some females seem to think they are.

sQu3LLqtaa	You will probably peak at 5'8 at 18 when males usually stop growing.<br>  <br>  Your twin sister may have reached her peak height already as girls usually stop growing at 15.<br>  <br>  Most boys outgrow their dad but some don't.|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	it also depends on ur dad's brothers and ur moms sisters and brothers,,, because my mom and dad are short but my brother is taller than both of themm, i guess its because my uncles are very tall,, so u could actually be taller than ur parents..
PQMvm2emaa	bring a book and read to her.  <br>  make her a playlist for her mp3 player and take it to her.<br>  paint her nails.<br>  bring her some magazines.|`|aKVtNgZGaa	IM GOING THOROUGH THE SAME THING JUST BE WITH HER<br>  YOU WILL FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO <br>  WHEN YOUR WITH HER SHE WILL NEED HELP <br>  ON SMALL THINGS LIKE GO TO THE LIBRARY BEFORE THEY CLOSE <br>  BEST OF LUCK|`|aCtYx7Gaaa	Honestly, all she needs is you to be there for her. That's all she needs to know is that you are by her side.<br>  If you feel like you can't take it anymore, how do you think she feels~ she's living it.<br>  Just be there for her<br>  Good luck! :0(<br>  ps the flowers might might make her breathing worse.|`|GGjjtHmHaa	well, buying her flowers is one way to get to her heart, but men dont understand, you dont need to spend money on most women, especially the amazing ones. because the amazing ones realize that there is more to life than money, so just be there to hold her hand and tell her that it's ok...if she dies, what do you think she's gonna remember, flowers or her boyfriend spending every moment he can holding her hand making sure that the hospital was doing everything it can to make sure she's ok?|`|jqZY0OyPaa	Just be there for her. Visit her often... hospitals really suck and being with someone you care about can make all the difference. Time is the biggest charity to give.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and her and may God give her health.|`|QAIidGt2aa	I'm sorry about that i think you should just treat her normally and share a few laughs and get her some flowers. But make sure to talk to her and make her feel comfortable..|`|unrdcGkpaa	guys calm down<br>  <br>  try to find her favorite thing or something she is dreaming about .|`|Goxj1meyaa	if she needs to be in the hospital because of her condition bring fun activities that wont tire her out to her bed side.  she is probably very bored you should sit with her talk to her bring her her favorite movies to watch play fun games with her maybe bring her flowers and leave them for her if shes asleep so she has something to wake up too.  dont remind her all the time though that she is sick, you dont want to depress her. just make her feel normal and happy.|`|GJlEpxqeaa	I know it's tough to deal with something like that, but you know what would make her happy and calm you down? Go to where she is and bring her flowers. Tell her she's beautiful and let her know how you feel. I'm a girl and if I was in the hospital that would make my day. Hope I helped!8)|`|hydOQHc8aa	MAybe dnt make her feel diff. make her feel happy like as if everything is alright make her forget she is in the hospital show her u care take her a rose everyday you see her make her feel needed and wanted and tell her to be strong..and you should not give up on her and be strong for her|`|4Qx8lGs0aa	I have been in a similar situation and I have sympathy for the both of you. The most important thing for her now is to see you by her side. All the flowers and gifts in the world cannot compare to the gift of your presence. I wish both of you good health luck.|`|RYf3sf6Daa	bring her flowers, chocolates, a big teddie bear and a really cute note <br>  that would be sooo cute, and i bet it will make her feel better and have the will to get better|`|XL0cIxj1aa	just be there for her hun. ask the nurses how you can help out and her parents. if your old enough to drive see if you can help run some errands so that her parents can spend more time with her and walk the dog if they have one. just do little eveyday tasks for her and her family that'll be more help than you think. and flowers are always nice too but dont break the bank. just show her lots of love and care. bring some meals in, hold her hand, watch movies, read to her, so on and so forth. she'll appreciate it. hopefully that helps and i'm praying for her. hopefully it wont be painful.

It will fill you up.<br>  <br>  Also, get some of that food out of the house!

kep1iGHpaa	People think that loose vagina's mean you've had sex a lot or you masturbate to much. <br>  <br>  That's not true.<br>  <br>  How loose you are depends on how nervous you are.<br>  If your tight, that means your nervous.<br>  And if your nervous you probally shouldn't be having sex yet.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	It doesn't necessarily mean you are loose. Like someone else said, you were probably just relaxed. All of my friends told me sex for the first time really hurt, however for me it wasn't so painful. I believe it was because I was very relaxed and comfortable.|`|cCVvrIFHaa	a lose vagina?!?!?!?<br>  <br>  <br>  ROFL I AGREE WITH  THE ONE BELOW ME ROFL!!!!!! THE JERRY SPRINGER GUY<br>  <br>  YEAH YOUR BF NEEDS TO HAVE A TALK WITH "i fingered more then 1 girl in days" guy|`|brSfRLspaa	girls like to brag about how much sex hurts as a way of proving how tight they are, they probably liked it to and are just lying|`|ISHIDwawaa	If your friends are virgins, they may not have broken their hymen yet. So it would be tighter for their vaginas, than yours which you probably already broke the hymen on while masturbating. Masturbating is perfectly natural and normal, and your little fingers won't make it too loose. Having a tight vagina is obviously desirable for a male, however too tight can also be difficult for a male to initially penetrate. Don't worry your  vagina is perfectly normal, a penis is a lot bigger than a finger and a male will find your vagina very enjoyable. Don't have sex without condoms, and you should probably not mess around with the same guy as your friends are anyways, thats not a good idea.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	You should call Jerry Springer with this headline...It should read: I fingered them all,but only one liked it.|`|grPckwSsaa	stop hooking up with guys that hook up with 2 of your other friends too
hSOEgpPNaa	No honey, you are perfect|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	FAT is a very bad word to describe yourself period. what you should  be asking yourself is what is you BMI (body mass index), which will determine if  your OBESE (more fat than you need). According to the information you provided you have a BMI of about 21.6 (which is below 24.6) which is the cap for "normal" BMI.<br>  So no worries, you are not "fat", but if you don't like the way you feel or look, excercise and dieting never hurts. :)|`|lAqCODHKaa	Def not, lol....

4uike3ARaa	Can't answer about Mirena...I'm a guy, haven't a clue what Mirena is. But as to having your questions deleted, that's a Y!A one-fer. All it takes is one or two people to start reporting abuse on the same question, and boom, that question is deleted. There isn't any QA of the questions themselves by Y!A. It all comes down to who's reporting it. And yes, trolls can get to higher user levels.|`|MXRXG62oaa	its probably a troll... happens to me sometimes. its unfair
SltEwVX7aa	maybe, maybe not.  I'm 5'10", and I have size 13 feet.  Foot size is no different than eye color, nose size, or whether you have hairy toes.  It's all genetics.  If the rest of your family has big feet, then chances are you're going to.  You're height suggests this;  you're tall like your relatives.  I'm sure your feet are gonna grow some more.  Can't predict how much.|`|AA12022261	it means you have 46 chromosomes|`|o9kWtq3Paa	it doesnt have anything to do with it.<br>  i promise.|`|MLqtSzaMaa	myth

He or she can prescribe medication that can reduce the frequency and severity of outbreaks.|`|lNU0BF6Eaa	Ive had it for about a year now. Ive never had any huge bumps tho. It seems like the doctor would hav given you a pill called valtrex. I myself dont use the pill. I take vitamins called Lysine each day. Its made specifically for herpes or cold sores. Also eat foods high in Lysin, such as: milk, some fruits and veggies, fish, eggs, hamburger meat and others that u can look up on line. wear cotton under wear, and soaking in the bath tub helps also. Keep the bumps dry and make sure that u spread the lips of the vagina when urinating to stop the stream from contacting the blisters. Drinking organic carrot, celery and beat juice combined also helps when u drink daily. Im so sorry about your situation.|`|tbFI2XJeaa	Get enough sleep. Making sure that you get adequate rest is another natural way to treat herpes. Also, making time to exercise can prevent an outbreak. Or try searching for homeopathic remedies products that will help you to cure herpes naturally.

AA11846603	If you're constantly thirsty and urinating a lot, you could have what's called diabetes insipidus.

3908da29f0769fb75937d8093758a4f4aa	My guess would be that you became more stressed for some reason.  Try looking back to see what happened before the "Ck" episode started to see if it might have been the result of extra stress in your life.|`|D3rw1C8faa	Just like you said, you have Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder!  Racing thoughts, doing certain behaviors over and over again.  I also have this so this is an easy question for me.  Talk to a doctor.  There are many medications available from a physician that can stop this behavior.  I know it seems that you are going crazy and might feel that no one else experiences these behaviors.  But realize it can get worst at times and this disorder is not one you can just "wish" away.  You need medication like I do.  Don't let it go until it ends up disabling you.  You can't do much else if you are obsessing about words with 'ck' in them.  Do  youself a favor and see a regular doctor.  Good luck!
OgQ8opeAaa	You get syphilis through sex, and that's it.  That's the only way to get it.  If you are born with it, you are profoundly mentally retarded (literally).<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, though, syphilis is referred to as the "great mimicker," so there are many diseases out there that can give you "syphilis symptoms."  If she has not been sexually active, she doesn't have it.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	Was she molested or raped?  She should really get tested she might not be telling you everything.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	If she hasn't had sex, then that isn't possible unless she was born with it.. and she would know that by now.  Nobody can tell you what else it might be because you have not described symptoms.|`|GuKofUzSaa	there is NO way to get an STD unless she comes in contact with someone who has it. That means not just having sex; even touching someone with certain STDs can pass it on. Therefore, giving a guy a hand job and then using the rest room afterwards, is a possible way to get it. If this could be the case, she needs to go see a doctor asap. If not, then it is not syphilis, or any other STD.|`|eXwnWqROaa	The route of syphilis is almost always through sexual contact sometimes it can be past from mother to child. If left untreated it can cause damage to the heart,aorta,brain,eyes and bones. In some cases theses effects can be fatal. So if she has this STD then she needs to go to the clinic asap. you didnt say what symptoms she has so i have no idea about what she might have....???|`|uIAHkm0Naa	cheater

I'm 5'5ish and weigh 147-149. <br>  Somedays I think I'm fat, others I think i'm fine. <br>  <br>  It's an average, healthy weight so it's nothing to worry about.|`|oZBqBxhSaa	You are on the boundry of healthy weight and overweight.

The most effective are SSRI's like Zoloft or Paxil<br>  By the way Hypoglycemia is not an actual disease.  It is a temporary condition when someones blood sugar drops too low.  Some people may be more prone to it, but there is not a chronic medical condition called hypoglycemia despite what people seem to think|`|ehBPus3Zaa	You can have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia with these symptoms. Hypoglycemia means not enough sugar, and hyperglycemia means too much sugar in your blood. But you need a doctor to check you out to see what is going on, and what if anything else it could be. You can develop symptoms of both when you are diabetic.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No, you don't have low blood sugar.|`|wWaGn3WLaa	go to the doctor and get a blood test. that is the only way i know to be sure|`|DD2RNTDvaa	No but I would suggest going to a doctor and getting checked out and go to a counselor on the other stuff...
Xv91Ox1caa	I also had a skiing tumble 2 weeks ago. My knee got twisted and i had an impact on the kneecap on rocks also. The knee swelled up to the size of an orange after the fall, but the first aid on the mountain strapped it up.  I went to A & E 2 days later and was told after a quick examination and told there was nothing seriously wrong. Nearly 2 weeks later i am still off work, i have bruising on the back of the knee, but no pain in that area, but the knee cap, and the outside of the knee is still very tender. I suspect you may have some tendon damage , which takes a while to heal, but good luck in your recovery.|`|GMPKpJzBaa	I would suggest going back to the doctor to see if they can do anything, and if they cant ask them to refer you for physiotherapy :)

Lots of stuff contains raw eggs, and I doubt any bacteria could live on ramen noodles for long enough to infect you after eating a pack... and if you cook them before eating them, then you're killing bugs anyways. They're bad for you because they have a lot of salt and some brands have tons of fat, but the raw eggs aren't really an issue.|`|zDVTBa7Taa	People told me eating them wasnt that good for you. because i for 1 eat the ALOT as well. Like at least a pack a day. But i looked into it found out its fine. Now if you eat like 5 packs a day or something yeah, id say thats bad. But like i have a pack a day then dinner.<br>  <br>  plus, if your working out ... thats better. Because they do have alot of salt in them.|`|Kv5BA0cgaa	Noodles are fine.

pQWZNafqaa	its just genetic. you may have gotten a recessive gene that causes your eyes to be darker than theirs. being outside more often may cause that too, just like being out in the sun darkens the skin due to melanin.|`|un0C52G8aa	Blue eyes are recessive but people can have different shades of blue. Perhaps you have an ancestor from several generations ago who had the same eye color and it has only just reappeared again.|`|acNIkeVvaa	You are mostly likely genetically coded to produce more pigment.  Thus you still have the 'same' blue eyes as they do, however, have more pigment present.|`|0eFcXyZ6aa	blue is recessive. two blue eyed people can not have a brown eyed child.But if yours are dark blue then that,s just the genes you were dealt.

This principle is all about ensuring you have a variety in your workouts. This will be a variety of sets, reps, exercises, rest periods, etc. It is also important to train the muscle from the most efficient position, in which it has the greatest mechanical advantage / stress (do compound exercises). It remains critically important to supplement those exercises with others utilizing various angles for certain exercises. Muscles should never be allowed to accommodate to an exercise to the point where the exercise is ineffective and doesn’t result in hypertrophy or the goal you were looking for. This variety will improve your motivation, keep you mentally fresh, and keep your muscles growing. Good luck!|`|zNEBVneGaa	More weight and fewer reps, lots of protein to rebuild the rips.  Nutrition is important, not just powders, but real food. GenF20 HGH is great as well, see source.|`|AA12015829	lift heaven.

i0nlqfJVaa	Honestly I have never heard of BC causing problems with food allergies. Reactions with other medications and medical problems yes, but not food allergies. She should be fine. Since she has to go to a doctor to get a prescription for it anyway, she should discuss this with her doctor. But I honestly don't see why she can't take them.
sR6NlPsDaa	This does sound like it would be hard to get to sleep! You should brush your teeth extra good to clean bacteria out of your mouth. Take a couple gulps of water and get it bed. You may have to change the side you are lying on, because your nose may get stuffy on one side. Lying on your back can help, but it may be unconformable. Lie on the side that is NOT stuffy :) Once you are in a good position, relax and day dream. Soon enough, it will be morning and you can drink water and deal with other stuff.<br>  <br>  Also, sometimes bubbles can help your throat. Sprite helps me, and ice cream because it is cold. Don't run around too much, or you will be breathing hard and get an even dryer throat!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you get to sleep! lol :)|`|MidOZlMzaa	I know sometimes we hesitate about calling the doctor, but that's what they're there for!  Another option is to contact the pharmacy and ask to speak to the pharmacist, they are very well educated and should be able to tell you if it's one of the medications you're on.  Good-luck!

It's derived from natural corn starch and is a food grade modified starch. So what’s so special with Waxy Maize? Many people, including me, have used a mix of dextrose and maltodextrin for post workout nutrition for years because it works and is vital for proper glycogen replenishment. WMS has a much higher molecular weight and a much lower osmolarity rate compared to dextrose or maltodextrin, so what does this mean… Mainly, WMS bypasses the stomach, is absorbed by the intestines and immediately is assimilated; this is all done at a much faster rate than dextrose or maltodextrin, almost double.<br>  <br>  WMS can help the absorption rates of many of your favorite supplements like creatine monohydrate, creatine ethyl ester, cell volumization and nitric oxide type supplements, etc. Nutrients like this often times are left in the stomachs harsh acidic environment and degrade absorption rates. WMS helps shuttle these nutrients to bypass the stomach and allow the body to assimilate these nutrients at a much higher rate.<br>  <br>  WMS has the ability to replenish the body’s glycogen stores much faster. This is accomplished again by WMS’s ability to bypass the stomach and go to the intestines for immediate absorption. WMS’s ability to shuttle all these nutrients and starch gives the body an immediate "pump" you can physically feel in your muscles post workout. You will see a much larger, fuller and rounder muscle belly.<br>  <br>  Dextrose and maltodextrin can cause water retention and bloating, hence WMS’s popularity with pre contest and contest preparation carbohydrate replenishment. Many dieters choose WMS as their carb of choice as it is sugar free and an ideal source of a long chain complex carbohydrate.<br>  <br>  It is very bland in flavor and has a white fluffy like consistency. I recommend using a shaker cup or a blender (this is best) to mix this product.

That happened to me once, I wasn't taking b/c, but my period lasted for about 12 days before I went to the emergency room. On the 13th day I found out that I was pregnant. I lost the baby because it was what the doctors called a "spontaneous abortion" aka miscarriage. I don't want to scare you, but if you did have sex and now you see that your period is going hay wire you want to make sure that everything is okay.|`|2G0a5zUSaa	This is most likely caused by the forgotten pills.  Unless you start to feel faint or ill I wouldn't worry about it.  I would though make sure I didn't forget in the future.

Try to tie taking your pill to an activity you perform every day.|`|sBsFK2h5aa	Normally my period is 6-7 weeks. Dont worry. If its more then eight, then try calling your doctor.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you need to go pee, then you should do it.  It is very bad to suppress urination as it can cause infection.  If you feel you are peeing too much, drink less fluid and eat foods high in potassium to ensure you get a good combination of the two.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|44BEm1Uhaa	To stop these types of pains,you should eat more banana's|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	Most of the body’s potassium is stored inside various cells and organs, with only a small amount found in the blood. The body maintains a balance of potassium in the blood by matching the amount of potassium taken in with the amount excreted (put out) by the kidneys. Hypokalemia occurs when the body releases too much potassium, such as through severe vomiting, diarrhea, or sweating during intense exercise. It also can be caused by a disease that affects kidney function – the kidneys may excrete too much potassium, or may not be able to match their output to the body’s potassium intake. Diseases that can cause hypokalemia include Liddle’s syndrome, Cushing’s syndrome, Fanconi’s syndrome, and Bartter’s syndrome. Certain drugs called diuretics increase the body’s urine output, which can also cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can be caused by overuse of laxatives; by eating disorders such as bulimia, which involves self-induced vomiting; and by prolonged fasting and starvation. Although it is less likely, hypokalemia can also be caused by not eating enough foods that contain potassium, and by eating too much licorice.<br>  <br>  symptoms can include muscle weakness, cramping, or flaccid paralysis (limpness); leg discomfort; extreme thirst; frequent urination.<br>  <br>  The point is: The low potassium can be the CAUSE of the frequent peeing. Therefore, up your potassium and the cramping and peeing should lessen. Good Luck!|`|g3OCU69Zaa	no that won't happen. i would recommend that you increase your water intake and be sure to eat at least one banana a day to help with the cramping. also be sure to stretch out your calves before you go to bed at night so they are loose. as well as stretching out the cramp instead of letting it cramp up it works really well.|`|zdQGden1aa	No, it shouldn't. Charlie horses definitely come from low potassium, but the best way to counter that might be by eating a banana. You might have a problem with bladder control, and if so that would be more along the lines of dehydration.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Excessive urination can be a sign of something serious.  You should see a doctor.|`|AA11315244	Yes, it certainly can. In order to tell you weather you need to reduce the amount of urine your secreting I need to know if your urinating frequently at night or day? If so, there can be another problem involved such as urinary track infection or diabetes and such. You can also have your potassium levels check by your doctor by doing a simple blood test. I left you a website for reference! Good luck!|`|25YGiBhZaa	This may seem odd but you still need to keep hydrated with lots of water. A daily banana and/or a potassium supplement should help too. Do you wear high heels? I used to get nightly charlie horses when I wore heels. Now I rarely wear high heels but when I do I always stretch out my calves after removing them and before going to bed. Just google calf stretches. There are plenty. I particularly like downward dog. Stretching my calves has completely eliminated my legs cramping in the middle of the night.|`|Tmmm02Woaa	If you are taking a diuretic it could contribute to an electrolyte imbalance.|`|e7ee85fc90821767f2ddefaae94e5723aa	Im not too sure, consult a doctor.
2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	It is best to eat AFTER you work out. This is because you have increased your heart rate and boosted your metabolism during your workout.<br>  <br>  Many people drink a protein shake right after a workout. This is because your body's metabolism is up and is ready to metabolize the protein. This helps maintain the muscle you were trying to create during the workout.<br>  <br>  Therefore, you can eat right after a workout, and it is best to make sure it has a high protein content!|`|g1jCs7sEaa	After you work out is the best time to eat. Wait about an hour. I was just talking to my husband about this yesterday. Drinking a protein shake is good to drink right after you work out to help with muscle tone.

But we should not kill anyone in the process.|`|9EAIMt0Baa	The only reason people are against stem cell research is because their juevos hurt when people talk about killing zygotes for the sake of research.<br>  <br>  However, those zygotes are practically dead anyway because if they are not used for research, then they were going to be discarded anyways.<br>  <br>  Plus stem cell research is some of the most advanced medicine out there. Finding a way to allow crippled people to walk again should be your motivation.|`|AA11303270	I think that it needs to be done ethically.  We are not suppose to play G-d, creating clones for the sake of science.  I think that if it improves the lives of already living beings it's great. Things such as curing deceases, helping live better lives due to a handicap, etc. <br>  <br>  I believe there are ethical / moral limits that most times get ignored, just because they are not written.  Deep in all of us, we know those limits exists, and many times there are no ways to explain them (such as to write laws about them).|`|5tVnmOmRaa	For one thing, medicine and genetics are entwined, whether we like it or not. on top of that, calling cloning medicine is debatable. generally though.

Cloning is a lil more edgy... i feel that science shouldn't be restrained by any particular belief though. If they can figure out how to alter an animal organ with human DNA so that it may work as a human transplant then i believe a person should have the choice to get it or not.
AA10188961	You can't fix this on your own.  You need to go to the doctor.  Go to planned parenthood if you cannot afford a doctor.  Seriously.

They could be benign liver tumors such as hemagiomas or focal nodular hyperplasia.  They could be premalignant tumors such as adenomas.  They also could be metastatic disease from a cancer somewhere in her body (most likely, colorectal).  In addition to her CT scan, she should have a colonoscopy (if she hasn't had a normal one in the past 5 years) and a mammogram and clinical breast examination.  I would also recommend drawing a CEA level, CA 19-9 level, and a CA125 level (tumor markers).<br>  <br>  Try not to get too worried at this stage of the game.  Those things are more than likely nothing to worry about, but the bad stuff needs to be ruled out because even good people who live healthy lives can get bad disease.
O2GRn8oOaa	you need to see the doctor and tell him that something is wrong|`|tqMi1Iefaa	Make a solution of 50% white vinegar, 50% hydrogen peroxide (a couple of bucks from the supermarket) Place on a small piece of cotton wool.

Also, put a bit of vaseline around the wart, or the hydrogen peroxide/vinegar solution will burn the skin.<br>  Also, my son had a large wart on his knee, and damaged his knee doing sport.  He wore a thick support bandage (the kind that you do up with velcroe) for 3 days and nights, and when he took it off, the wart had dropped off.  It hasn't come back in over a year.  I think it was the lack of oxegyn to the wart, and the constant friction of the bandage.|`|fYbAS8xwaa	That's so gross

uO9QoEmVaa	Am sad that you have no means to go to the doctor right now, but it won't  hurt much if you will have urinalysis (it doesn't cost much anyways)..this way you can confirm if the infection recurred.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile cranberry juice and water is best if you have urine problems. But as soon as you see the result (pus cells, red blood cells not within normal limits) then you MUST really seek a doctor for proper prescription of antibiotics. Delaying it might give you a more serious problem and sometimes damage is irreparable.<br>  <br>  Avoid eating salty and fatty foods, drink plenty of water and don't forget , the urinalysis...it's very important. God bless!|`|jKmbJyxJaa	If you do not have a fever or back/lower body ache then you may only have a urinary tract infection. <br>  <br>  Oranges, grapefruit, and blueberries can help. Drink lots of water, and try to limit sugar if you can. <br>  <br>  Showers are usually recommended over baths, as bacteria are floating around in the water and can enter your body. <br>  <br>  If you do get a fever, severe pain, or vomiting I would really suggest you go to the ER so they can give you antibiotics as a kidney infection can kill you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|7CTvtek0aa	OK it is probably a urinary tract infection you will need an antibiotic to avoid it getting A LOT worse, but for now I recommend AZO- it is an over the counter medication that numbs the urinary tract( you can get it at any drug store)  and will make you feel so much better, takes away the burning and urgency.  But remember it only treats the symptoms and not the infection, it is great for temporary relief.  It will turn your pee bright orange.

There are professionals who are willing to work with you with payment and there are even free services. if you are still in school, most schools offer their students counseling as a part of tuition. financial counselors can also come free. your school would probably have career counselors. they will help point you in the right direction of what you want to do in life.  you may want to seek a psychiatrist as well.  discuss this with your counselor.

AA10725882	Had to do some research on this one.<br>  This situation isn't common; I never had a patient with this in 20 years.<br>  Also, since cytotoxic chemotherapy works poorly if at all for the majority of these patients, medical oncologists are not always consulted.  <br>  <br>  An NCI (USA) study <a href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/102528538/abstractevaluated" rel="nofollow">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journ...</a> 10,878 carcinoid tumors that were identified by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) from 1973 to 1999 - - so that's only 418 cases per year in the U.S. with onlly a fraction having carcinoid syndrome.<br>  <br>  From Medline Plus : <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000347.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...</a> { A Mayo Clinic Review says nearly the same thing.}<br>  Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing cancers that usually start in the lining of the digestive tract or in the lungs. Because they grow slowly and don't produce symptoms in the early stages, the average age of people diagnosed with digestive or lung carcinoids is about 60.<br>  In later stages the tumors sometimes produce hormones that can cause carcinoid syndrome. The syndrome causes flushing of the face and upper chest, diarrhea, and trouble breathing.<br>  Surgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors. If they haven't spread to other parts of the body, surgery can cure the cancer.<br>  - - - - <br>  Most carcinoid tumors have no symptoms. They only produce the syndrome about 10% of the time. So the syndrome is a rare manifestation of a rare malignancy.<br>  When symptoms do occur, they may include:<br>      * Abdominal pain that comes and goes<br>      * Bright red flushing of the face<br>      * Diarrhea (may be explosive and severe)<br>      * Heart palpitations<br>      * Low blood pressure<br>      * Wheezing<br>  Sometimes symptoms are brought on by physical exertion, or eating or drinking things such as blue cheeses, chocolate, or red wine.<br>  - - - -<br>  A serotonin antagonist may be prescribed to control diarrhea and poor absorption of nutrients from the intestines (malabsorption).<br>  Avoid alcohol, large meals, and foods high in tyramine (aged cheeses, avocado, many processed foods), because they may trigger symptoms.<br>  Some common medicines, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs, such as Paxil, Serzone, and Prozac) may make symptoms worse by increasing levels of serotonin. However, do not stop taking these medicines unless your doctor tells you to do so.<br>  One of several combinations of chemotherapy may be given through a vein (IV) or by mouth. If one combination does not work, another combination may be effective. About one-third of patients benefit from chemotherapy. But responses are limited and partial; chemotherapy is not a cure in this type of malignancy.

W6LGsQC8aa	First of all, do NOT stick a phone into your vagina.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about using the vibration mode for external use on the clitoris while wearing underwear or some other protective barrier (MUCH better idea), then do as follows:<br>  <br>  Go to your alarm screen, and set each alarm for 1 minute apart (10:00, 10:01, 10:02) and you will have three minutes of lovely vibrations. Try switching up which ring tone you use for each alarm for different vibration patterns!|`|velIdcbNaa	erm... don't use your phone please! you put that on your face, and by your mouth!  If you are that desperate then go out and buy one or talk to your parents and see what they can do for you.  It may seem very very weird, but it's better then using your poor phone.  You'd be surprised what parents will be able to help you with if you really ever needed it.|`|SPnIxDviaa	Probably,<br>  But what about when you answer a call?<br>  Do you seriously want to put that next to your face?|`|oxsawg31aa	Gawd what is it with people on here using home made sex aids. Buy a vibrator for christs sake|`|RCfc9hMKaa	Uhhhh... I wouldn't. Your phone is probably covered in dirt and germs and you don't want that inside of you. It'll be disgusting afterwards too and if you try to... put it inside of anything, it could get stuck. Besides, it wouldn't be a very powerful vibration and yes you would have to press vibrate or call it over and over... If you're 18, you can go to an adult store and buy a vibrator for cheap, they can range between $10 and $100. If you're too young, you can buy a muscle vibrator at Walgreens, Target, Walmart, CVS, Bed Bath and Beyond, Ulta (etc, etc) in the same price range.|`|pUIGCtaZaa	That is so unsanitary!

There's nothing going on with your head. Nothing bad anyway. You sound exactly like myself before I did something about it. It's like a mix of depression and boredom.<br>  What I can say, smile more often, for no reason at all, even when your not happy. Every time you feel just blah smile. Slowly you'll find that the smile becomes real. If that doesn't work find something to distract you. Football, drawing, baseball, something. Just something to take your mind off of things. <br>  But never consider suicide, born again or no, however the after life works you'll never get back what you lost in this life. Suicide is like an addiction once you consider it, or even fail at it, the idea will always come back during bad times and make you more miserable in the end. You'll always have the disease as some say. Fight the bad times because they just prove that something good is coming your way even if you don't recognize it when it comes.<br>  But hey that's how I defeated it. If it doesn't work see a shrink. After all complaining to someone who is required to listen as their job is very therapeutic.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a>

hZxVbkhbaa	i had the same problem....and lets say it was bad when i was squatting 400+. i think you should try moving your hand position on the bar|`|qkblT2hgaa	You may have mild arthritis in your wrists. Check with your doctor for noninflammatory medication. Your wrists will continue to hurt if they don't get a chance to heal properly.<br>  <br>  As a temporary relief, try something like A5-35 rub. It is an over the counter ointment that does work. You may also have to invest in some wrist straps to help support your wrists.
08Vk3RtJaa	it looks like a pimply rash.  it can happen on parts of your body where your skin rubs together or chaffs. Areas like under your arm, between upper thighs, even between buttock cheeks and under breasts if you are a bit on the heavy side.  The rash would be more likely to appear in the warmer weather, when you wear less clothes and are a bit sweaty, but can happen anytime.<br>  <br>  Don't really know what you can do about it, if you are a bit overweight try to lose a bit, but don't get paranoid about it (even skinny girl's thighs will rub together sometimes).  Try to make sure your bra fits properly so there are no bulging bits under your arms and try talcum powder under your arms instead of sticky deodorant.|`|9ZDVH4kaaa	check your bed for bed bugs
RQh2IYRgaa	Yes you are as long as you still believe you are one and respect animal rights. ect.|`|KBBonf97aa	Yes, you're still a vegetarian.  Even the most militant vegetarians will occasionally and accidentally consume meat, but that doesn't have any bearing on their convictions or their chosen lifestyle.  Don't be hard on yourself over an insignificant accident.  If you'd sneaked a slab of prime rib into a lettuce sandwich, I'd say you weren't a vegetarian.  But yours was an innocent accident.

Qh01Ey7Daa	Well, even though I have mildly oily skin, it kind of dried my cheeks out, a little, and a bit on my chin.<br>  <br>  My nose is where I get most problem zits, and it actually made them shrink in size, and the redness went down a little.  Which made them hurt a lot less, too.<br>  <br>  Just be careful around sensitive areas like cheeks and chin, and maybe your forehead.  :)<br>  <br>  Oh, right.  If you have sensitive skin, don't do the peroxide thing.<br>  <br>  Plus, the aspirin will soak up enough of the oils, it won't really be necessary.|`|xJ2kcJsraa	i dunno, but it worked out amazing for me...<br>  <br>  my face as clear as hell for like 1 week...before i decided to pig out on mcdonalds.

2cRP9oHZaa	i have no clue but when they do its partay time!!!
mhFpZT3laa	I think the biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:<br>  1) Community Service<br>  2) Medically related volunteering/work<br>  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)<br>  <br>  Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.<br>  <br>  1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.<br>  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.<br>  <br>  2) A moderately well known school.<br>  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.<br>  <br>  3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.<br>  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.<br>  <br>  4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.<br>  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.|`|exMPHWKHaa	I also would like to become a pediatrician (I'm 17 Junior in high school) im currently taking a medicine coarse and psychology coarse online but to be honest you really don't have to start worrying about that till your second year of college. You should be looking to find out what you want to do instead of just walking in with a plan experience a bit of other things before you make a decision. Sorry I have no idea what direction to point you towards but I'm sure you'll figure it out at college. Good luck. EDIT: you could try talking with your guidance counselor at school he/she can most likely help you.
Vj13f7zmaa	13 isn't too young at all.  Who told you that?  It is just a sign that you are a virile young man.  Definitely time to start shaving.  First razor you should get the sensitive skin kind. It has thin wires across the blade so you don't cut yourself.  Use light pressure.  Look the great thing about getting facial hair a few months ahead of the other guys is if you start shaving with shaving cream every day.. it way cuts down on facial pimples.|`|aDCDwyieaa	It's a myth.  Shaving will not make it grow in faster or thicker.  It just seems like that.  Because each time you shave, it will come in darker but it will still come in darker no matter what.  And it starts to grow faster over time so that's why people say when you shave, it comes in faster.  But it's not from shaving.  It just grows faster due to nature.<br>  <br>  So yeah, your only option is shaving.  Or you can use scissors.  But that takes a while and doesn't get rid of all the hair.|`|RFuWnx00aa	well it will only grow thicker the more that you shave.. my hubby shaved alot when he was younger and now his hairs are real thick.. just shave but dont shave unless you need to...<br>  and the onther guy was right, 13 isnt too young.. both my brothers started around that age so you okay ;)|`|vb0FO6k0aa	may be hormonal imbalance see a doctor

Talk to your physician and ask for a referral to an Ear, Nose and Throat Doc.  You'll thank yourself later!  Hey, and if you have any Q's about it you can email me.  I can tell you what to expect if you decide to go through w/ it.
Q4ggnG0waa	MDS is not a single disease, but a group of disorders affecting the bone marrow. MDS is a disease of A SINGLE bone marrow stem cell which then starts producing ineffective and abnormal blood cells. It can be caused by long term exposure to toxic/chemical agents, such as benzene. There's also primary MDS in which there is no known cause. I really don't think you can prove long term exposure for a single spill, especially if the wreck was his fault. Since it was work related, if he's not an independent, he may qualify for workman's comp. He won't qualify for ssdi, since he should be back at work in 6 months. Good luck in your endeavor.

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health. Also, by removing excess belly fat, you can undercover your hidden six pack. <br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.
MbSSIOpSaa	Well, I've never been pregnant.....but if you're experiencing breast tenderness and pain this month in a way you never have before then I think good news might be on its way!|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I had to answer this as you only had a couple of answers and it didn't seem like they helped :o)<br>  <br>  I have had 2 boys and 4 miscarriages. With my first boy, had no breast change apart from a little tender, second boy kinda the same but they grew a couple of sizes! I had a miscarriage in my second trimester and it was a girl, my breasts during that pregnancy hurt like you would not believe and grew too, lots! It varies woman to woman and also pregnancy to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Baby dust!|`|d8a1650a641af865d4767bee05146a20aa	I remember the tenderness in my breasts both times and mastitis occurred after the baby was born. Now that was super painful.  You felt the need to express and as you expressed the milk it engorged the more. Have you missed  a number of periods that you think it is pregnancy?  Did you know that you can have your period and still be pregnant?  It happened to me, and my son is the result of that experience.
tIldpr7vaa	go on a hardcore low carb, no sugar diet and do tons of cardio<br>  <br>  and FYI its "lose"|`|HlD9dRF2aa	First for all the "quick weight loss posts" :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca..." rel="nofollow">http://www.fakereviewssuck.com/scams/aca...</a> (By the way that's the 11th post today for Acai or Tea that I've seen today.)<br>  <br>  Now for the real way. Work out smarter, not harder. Low intensity workouts (elliptical, running, biking) where your heart rate stays in Zone 2 (60-70% of maximum heart rate) burns calories at a rate 85% calories, 15% glycogen. The higher your heart rate or the more intense the workout the lower the ratio of Fat to Glycogen becomes.<br>  <br>  If you run 3 miles in 23 minutes and your heart is pounding at the end, you've burned about 480 calories of which probably 400 cal. came from sugar.<br>  <br>  If you WALK 3 miles in 45 minutes, and you feel like you could walk another 3 miles no problem, then chances are you burned 400 cal. that came from fat stores (which is harder for your body to replace) and 80 cal came from sugar. (The number of calories burned is essentially the same in either case because you do the same amount of work -- the laws of physics are hard to change.)<br>  <br>  LOW intensity exercise for the duration is the way to go for weight loss.  Lots of fruits and vegetables, no preprocessed foods, no fried foods and limit beef intake.  Go for chicken.  Cross train as well in cycling or swimming.<br>  <br>  There is one other option -- Train for a 1/2 ironman in 6 months.|`|4CsGde1qaa	Hold up, not to fast my friend. The fastest way to lose weight is like 6 lbs in one day. How do I know that? Well, because I have done it. If you want to lose this amount in just one day, it requires a lot of your energy and willpower, but mainly will power. Take turns jogging and running nonstop(seriously nonstop) for about 5 hours on a warm weather wear the Sun takes advantage on you(Summer). I can only do this on days on the summer, and expect to feel really light after. This is my moment, but if it seems to unrealistic to you, then don't do it. The weight you lose through my workout is composed of 90% fat, and 10% muscle.|`|wB8C1Zbkaa	Just eating healthy and exercising a good amount of time every day is the most natural, healthy way to lose fat, and it's not like it takes like forever to burn it off, like maybe four months if you do a whole bunch of swimming and like, water aerobics and running and stuff...a lot of the weight loss things you see on tv don't actually work, like in the crest commercial (going way off topic) the mouthwash works way better than brushing alone? it means that it works better than just brushing your teeth with water. they just get tricky with their words, you have to pay attention.|`|0QOAKWeCaa	Run with someone. Its much better than running alone because you have someone to keep you motivated. Also skip the sugary foods and junk foods like ice cream, candy, chips etc. Next time you walk into McDonalds don't order a Big Mac Combo, instead get something smaller and a salad as the side instead of the fries.|`|5db181f9ef16abe283773b859f06d725aa	eat healthy and exercise... its that simple.
jbUsd8m9aa	You can have your jawline reshaped. The people who usually get this surgery are transgendered male to female because they want a more feminine shaped face, but it is by no means limited to only those people.<br>  <br>  If you look up "facial feminisation" you can learn more about the procedure you are asking about.<br>  <br>  You are in Canada, so I don't know about the cost.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Anything not justified as medically necessary is plastic surgery. <br>  So yes what you speak of does fall into that category. <br>  <br>  Spend the money on therapy instead. With that attitude you will never be happy with what you have.
fZ3FXZMyaa	This is a very serious question.  I do have an answer.  Thoughts of suicide "taking your own life" is common in teenage years. Yet anyone can feel that way.  I don' think It is up to anyone to take a life.  I believe we were each put here on earth for a purpose.  It does help if you have faith in some relgion,  It is normal to think of dying, what it might be like or feel like or how it would happen.  I would sugest if you are having thoughts of wanting to kill yourself  go to the nearest emergecy room and tell them.  And yes I have taken pills and I did not od but came close.  Not a good experience|`|3SqtWtaxaa	I don't think so. A normal person want's to live, so someone that want's to kill themselves might be going through some problems. Just cause your having a bad day doesnt mean its time to end your life. we are all here for a reason. So if suicidal thoughts are in your mind. Try seeing a doctor because a normal person wants to live.|`|JL1xSaZ5aa	i think that everybody have thought about that in difficult situations. but the best thing is to control yourself and thing about the people who really love you. It′s better to think in good things and have a open mind to see the wonderful world.|`|p4r2u1D9aa	sent u an email!|`|6Tpa4MXSaa	There's too much to live for.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	I did when I was a teenager, but not seriously.|`|8lrB1lg0aa	Yes to both questions...I have been suffering with major depression for a few years now. I have seriously tried to kill myself 3 times, OD x2 and cutting my wrists. All 3 times ended up in hospital and twice having an extended stays in a mental ward and while in there got the treatment that was needed....however its much harder to keep going strong in the real world. I used to think and sometimes still do think that yes we have the right to decide when we want to die, in saying that I have been told to think about all the people we would leave behind and how it would affect them and their lives, even if we don't think it would, it does!! We have no right on other people's life, only our own!!!|`|jqZY0OyPaa	I feel it crosses everyone's mind from time to time. Things happen, people go through bad times... sometimes, things feel so out of control and thats the main reason why.|`|WoAY8eo9aa	i think about suicide all the time but never tried it|`|T0pXwNCkaa	no

Do some research. pictures do not lie.<br>  happened to my parents and could happen to you.<br>  its reality.|`|dUeDmb7raa	no not yet<br>  <br>  if you keep doing it for a few more days you easily could though<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  now is the time for will power and make a decision about whether you want to be a junkie or not and go down that path<br>  <br>  <br>  if you want to be clean its still early enough for you to quit cold turkey without the bad withdrawals|`|9OGwrxhsaa	dude, don't do it. once is enough. I'm serious, heroin will ruin the rest of your life. Think about what you can make out of yourself! Don't Do IT! Go get help!|`|3SqtWtaxaa	Your on the path if you keep on going. But if you don't touch it for one week straight. Youll be cured. From there on just challenge yourself not to take it.|`|0gvpklkIaa	yep|`|mDMnhqwdaa	I don't think so, Don't ever Ever do it again.|`|B4YESGmwaa	STOP before you are addicted. Doing heroin 2 times usually does not make you addicted to it, but obviously you have a good head start getting Addicted. You don't say how much you used each time, but it sounds as if you have a psychological addiction started, physical addicts take a bit longer. <br>  You also do not say what other drugs you are doing-like downers (benzo's) or weed, or alcohol. But seriously this will only get worse. If you would like to chat please feel free to email, or IM God Bless Reggie|`|90Pb6eooaa	Don't do it.  Seek help immediately.  I had a step dad that started the same way.  People get addicted because they want to kick the sickness that they feel from not doing the drug.  Anyway, my stepdad became addicted after a few tries.  God Bless You!|`|nZsHSKhjaa	you would then be addicted and on a spiraling down hill path.  and then what?  think of your future please!<br>  <br>  PLEASE DON'T DO ANYMORE!!!|`|WoAY8eo9aa	look what happened to Kurt Cobain? <br>  R.I.P|`|ZYvdnIYGaa	you're on your way. dont do it again,you may be sorry.

I lost 20 pounds, it definitely does work!|`|B12E4rYiaa	Any form of exercise is helpful but yoga for weight loss isn't the best choice. To burn fat you need intensity so you start out easy and build it. A combo of weight training and cardio is the best bet.|`|4CsGde1qaa	No. Yoga just stimulates your self esteem, causing you to want to exercise by will alone.
sQu3LLqtaa	Liver is extremely rich in vitamin A and you could easily overdose if you get too carried away.<br>  <br>  There is plenty of vitamin A in tomatoes,  oranges, carrots and other foods that you can find in a web search for "vitamin a rich foods".

PZjTc0geaa	Sam will not go to jail after he is released from the hospital. The hospital will send a bill to Sam. If Sam cannot afford to pay the bill, he can make arrangements with the hospital to possibly have his bill reduced and can be put on a payment plan. If Sam doesn't think he will ever be able to pay, then his account will be sent to collections and they will eventually sue him. Then his wages can be garnished if he has a job. If not, maybe then he could go to jail. That would take many years though. It's a long process.

If you have big built up muscles you can weigh that much and not be overweight. As a teenager, you should be eating 2,000 calories a day and getting about 30 minutes of exercise daily. Remember, your body and brain are still growing and need nutrition to do so properly.

SZdVYrSSaa	If you are kidding, then go right ahead and laugh this up, but there is an actual condition with these symptoms and I would know this, because I have been treated for it.<br>  <br>  In high school I began sleeping a lot in the day, never at night, and after a while, I barely slept at all. I was pale, drawn, I used to bite my lips when I was angry, nervous, sick, and I would rip at them until they began to bleed. I also had a lot of nosebleeds, and in both cases, the blood tasted great to me, I liked the salty flavor, the metallic undertones, it was a serious thing. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you've noticed this either, but you may also find that you have trouble keeping your hands and feet warm, you might find yourself craving other salty-sweet things, candied nuts, toasted bread with sugar and salted butter, caramel or kettle corn, orange juice and eggs, etc. <br>  <br>  What you want to look into with your doctor is the possibility of an iron deficiency coupled with dehydration and caffeine addiction or deficiency. They will give you some iron pills, and will tell you to do 25 minutes of contained cardio workouts before bed, eat plenty of red meat, and drink upwards of a gallon of room temperature or slightly chilled water per day. It's not life threatening, and it a shitty thing to keep up with and sometimes I slip up, but I always feel better when I keep to the regime.|`|jYMUzFRzaa	Yeah, you're totally a vampire, dude. Happy now?|`|1KqknaUHaa	I kinda have a problem like that.<br>  I don't think the sleeping thing is anything bad but the lip thing might be.<br>  I don't bite my lip but I love blood a lot a lot alot and it makes me feel better to see my own blood.<br>  It's probably mental :/|`|BDYzoPAqaa	Ok, like everyone is going to belive you|`|3pr75r2caa	Wow, someone would have to be EXTREMELY bored to come up with fake questions like this.<br>  <br>  lol|`|hlwjOwGWaa	oh my lanta! you are a real vampire!<br>  totally awesome<br>  <br>  (lol)|`|Z7UqFULJaa	I am the same way biting ur lips is like biting ur nails...no biggi, alot of people like the taste of blood so yeah. some sleepings problems are gentic others bad habits like when u were five did u saty up all the time to watch tv or sumthin.

Granted my mother died in her sleep and I'm sure that plays a huge part of it for me, but rationally speaking you're just as likely to die doing anything else "awake" as you are to die in your sleep. In fact considering you're only asleep for 8 hours in a 24 hour period, you're less likely to die in your sleep than any other time. I would just lay down at night and pray to whoever you believe in that He/they/etc.. will keep you safe as you sleep. You will be fine. You will wake in the morning, every morning. And if on the rarity you didn't, you would never even know you died in your sleep because you would be in a much better place where things like that doesn't matter.|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	If you are religeous you can sing or hum a hymn or say a prayer...it helps me all the time.|`|noF0WCkUaa	I get this sometimes, though for totally different reasons.<br>  <br>  Try to get used to, and accept that fact that you can't avoid sleep, no matter what. When you lie in bed, to keep your mind off the inevitable slumber, daydream, think about your day, call someone on the phone - to the point where you can no longer go...you will fall asleep naturally. And try to derive as much pleasure as possible. Soft blankets work, and they give off the impression of clouds.<br>  <br>  Or you could play music, watch tv, or meditate. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck. I believe in you!|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	seek counseling or therapy|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	Hunny, you need to relax. When my mother died I had to sleep with a dim light on and I still do.  She passed away in 2003. Death is something that is feared, because it is the unknown.  There is a strong animal like instinct in us to survive.  I do not know the curcumstances your in, but I can tell you if your not physcily sick or are dying.  Then you can put your fear to rest.  You are not going to die in your sleep.  My Grandmother was 90 years old and she was in bed my uncle was there and saw her die.  It was the most peaceful passing.  No pain. So if you need to sleep with the tv on low or a light on, it would be better than no sleep at all. I know you will be fine.|`|XWzb6sQwaa	masturbate|`|3SqtWtaxaa	Your not paranoid you have anxiety.

However, since tastes differ greatly among us and phobias are a fact, your fear and lack of sleep may lead you into a more serious condition after a while. Please see a Psychiatrist, so he can prescribe a relaxant to overcome your fears, and most of all allow you to achieve your 8 hrs. of what us humans "must have": sleep.|`|u6c5bTbVaa	I'm sorry if I'm not answering your question, but I'm going through the same thing right now. :(<br>  <br>  What I had to do last night was sleep with all the lights on and the tv on with the volume up a notch. Maybe the paranoid feeling will pass over in a week or so, but my feeling just came out of the blue so I'm not sure what's going to happen.|`|6kffeoyvaa	Lol, looking at your avatar while reading this is pretty funny.|`|E70A7aqcaa	As a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired, I had the opportunity throughout my career to work with an older psychiatrist who had the unique characteristic of recommending to most of  his patients that they go for a walk, for leisure only (no chores or walking the dog attached), about 5 days a week.  He'd tell his patients to start out slowly, relaxedly, and just let your body "get into the swing of things".  He went on to say that once your body felt it was loosened up a bit, pick up the pace some so that your heart and lungs were under a little bit of pressure.  Nothing severely stressful.  Just a bit quicker.  And then when you began feeling a bit winded or otherwise tired, start your way back home, slowing down your pace so that your muscles didn't get too tight or cramp after your walk.  He talked with me one day and said that if people did that, they'd feel MUCH more relaxed and comfortable, and much of what people suspect is "mental illness" would disappear, BUT, he added, people wouldn't do that simple little walking because they want some big, impressive diagnostic label put on them, and they want to "have to" take some expensive prescription medicines so they can be impressed with themselves and try to impress others.  He said because his recommendation was so "mundane", and free, people would never follow his recommendations, and therefore we'd always have patients and we'd always be in business.  Ya know, HE WAS RIGHT!!!!!  We had a great practice, and rarely did any of our patients do what WE recommended, which was to go for a simple and free little walk about 5 times weekly, which would help them relax and sleep better at night.  So, now I pass the old doctor's recommendation on to you.  He was right.  Sad thing now is that he died of old age maybe about 10 or 12 years ago.  He didn't take his recommendation to the grave with him because I keep passing it on.  He was a great old man, and I know I adopted many of his skills into my own practice.  I hope you give his remedy a try. It's free, and it's instant in its outcome.  God Bless you.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Try to learn relaxation exercises.

AA10457351	You didn't say how long it has been since you've seen the doctor and got the antibiotics. If it has only been a few days, give them a chance to get into your system and start clearing up the infection. If after you have finished up the medications you are still having problems hearing, schedule an appointment to follow up with your doctor to see if there is something else wrong. <br>  <br>  Another thing you might try (it works for me sometimes) is to pop your ears:<br>  1. Take a deep breath through the mouth - Do not immediately exhale!<br>  2. Close your mouth, pinch your nose shut with your thumb & index finger.<br>  3. Attempt to blow as if you were blowing your nose. <br>  <br>  If you do this properly, you should be able to pop your eardrums (you will definitely know when you do this), and it will relieve some of the stuffiness in your ears.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps ... Good luck to you!

Blood cells can only produce other blood cells and their only job is to carry nutrients and oxygen to the tissue and organs in your body. Think of it like this -- you can't grow a pineapple plant from an apple seed -- and the same is true of blood and sperm. Sperm is actually made of DNA and chromosomes and is produced from the protein and cholesterol your body takes in from the food you eat. Your body's going to make the sperm whether you masturbate or not and masturbating doesn't cause your body to make extra. The body makes the same amount no matter what and it actually takes longer to produce sperm cells than any other type of cell because of the unique form of cell division used to produce it. The body is designed to keep up with all normal body processes and masturbation and sperm production are included in the normal functions the body is meant to experience so you shouldn't have any concerns.|`|8gOIc4dMaa	Well if you bleed im pretty sure that it isnt supposed to do that.<br>  If that happened to you i would get that checked out.

This is the moment of truth. If she says yes, then, that was easy! But if she doesn't, you may want to back-up your question.<br>  <br>     3. You could make a list of reasons (or just list them), and read about tampons on the Internet before asking her. Hopefully she'll be glad that you've been doing research for something that you want. This will also make her think that you're more responsible.<br>  <br>      * If no one in your family uses tampons, then you may really want to follow step 3.<br>  <br>      * Getting mom to say yes may be easy if you've gotten your period many times before. She should understand that you've had it with pads!<br>  <br>      * Just in case she's not completely with the idea of tampons, you may not want to use them all the time. Try just during the day.<br>  <br>      * By the way, this is your body, not your mother's. No one else has an explicit right to tell you how to manage your own period. If, however, your mom has religious or moral objections against tampon use, then you should research tampons thoroughly and discuss them with her. In the end, though, this is your decision.<br>  <br>      * You must be brave doing this. I know this may sound weird but if you are nervous you will sound extremely awkward.<br>  <br>      * If you do begin using tampons, be sure to change them at least every 8 hours. If you don't, you could be at risk for a very serious and potentially life threatening infection, called toxic shock syndrome, or TSS.|`|kep1iGHpaa	Sometimes its awkward to say things like that.<br>  <br>  Write a note, and leave it in her car.<br>  On the seat or somewhere that she'll see it for sure as soon as she gets in. <br>  Make the note short and bland.<br>  <br>  "Mom, can you pick me up some tampons please? Thank you"<br>  Or<br>  "Can you pick me up some tampons. Thanks"<br>  <br>  Just whatever you want. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|k86KdyYOaa	Tell her like this:<br>  <br>  Mum, you know how I'm really sporty?<br>  Well, I figured that it would be easier if I used tampons when I do sport, so I can do my best and take my mind off my period.<br>  It's not comfortable doing sports in a pad.|`|n1hoBuhSaa	Tell her you know mom im sporty and i think i should start using tampons|`|yQpGtbKNaa	just tell her straight up...thats how i told my mom and she was like ok|`|a21ngdX7aa	you could just go to the supermarket and buy them yourself. if you really want to include your mom though, just tell her exactly what you have said here. she will understand, she is a woman too and knows what a hassle periods can be.|`|TiN0pZjOaa	ishe might think it's a bad idea, but try showing her a platex site and show her the part about moms & first time users. just show that to her, i'm pretty sure she'll let you|`|PQ21qz9Xaa	Just tell her exactly what you just said! I'm willing to be she will bet supportive. My mom always bought me pads because she thought that's what I wanted. When I told her I wanted tampons, she bought them instead.|`|2cRP9oHZaa	Say umm im getting to the age that I need to take extra responsibility and i dont want to ya know........ ya know so ummm i think its time for me to start using tampons|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Mom, I want to use tampons.  The boys at gymnastics point and talk about me when I use a pad.
fnw1lTskaa	These are all absolutely wrong...marijuana stays in your system for 30 days total, longer in your hair.  but if you smoked a small hit or even a few, they would never be able to tell.  There would be too much fluids in your body diluting the thc, that it is basically not possible for them to know.  they may get a trace reading of it, but there is so many things these days that gives that trace.  poppy seeds is one.  but i really dont think they would even be able to get a trace reading!!  dont be worried..people are putting down answers that they  have heard before...not what it actually is....|`|LLnNjH94aa	Two weeks.|`|EBt6Wbqpaa	regardless of amount taken marijuana metabolites stay in your system between one and three months.|`|TJ2EfH7oaa	I like how you added the adjective "small" to your statement.  The fact is that if you inhaled it, then "it's" in there (your system) !!  Oh, and the time frame is more like 3-4 weeks (depending on your size, weight, metabolism, etc).  Seems like drinking lots of water will help, too.|`|wcWTwFFpaa	up 2 30 days no matter how much you smoke, if someone were to do a hair folicle test they could detect it 3 months later|`|73fuqfSyaa	ick.|`|3evjyxBJaa	3 days up to 3 months! depends how strong it is!
Q4ggnG0waa	Pimple like things are normally pimples.|`|xYTagSIyaa	<a href="http://www.healthnewsflash.com/conditions/skin_cancer.htm#pix" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthnewsflash.com/condition...</a><br>  <br>  the above site has a few skin cancer photo's <br>  <br>  If you have anything suspicious looking it should really be checked with your doctor so you can be certain you are alright.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	How long has it been there???<br>  <br>  If it looks like a pimple, feels like a pimple and has reacted and grown like a pimple, then ist is probably just a pimple, or maybe an ingrown hair.<br>  <br>  Hurt like hell, but heal quickly.|`|8faf22e67ce357b21e19f86ca8848144aa	My guess would be is that it's an ingrown hair. Look up an image - they normally show like pimples, and it's in the right area for many possible ingrowns.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  I found this image online. Some do get bigger than that.<br>  <a href="http://www.healthdiaries.com/august21a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthdiaries.com/august21a.j...</a>|`|vVfH8yBYaa	More likely an ingrown hair or folliculitis. Go see a doctor. We can't diagnosis a skin condition via the internet.|`|zBwyfE92aa	Well, if it does not heal and returns then yes, more than likely it is cancer. Go get it checked out!|`|lCZxLr8zaa	1st, make sure it isn't something that's been there before like a mole or your clitoris (depending on the area).  If you're unfamiliar with your body take a mirror and get familiar- consider taking notes or pictures you can keep in a safe place to compare again in the future to notice changes and show your doctor if you need to.<br>  <br>  Everything could be cancer is the truth, but it sounds unlikely.  For moles and likely most other thingamabobs, though less applicable to sudden lesions, you'd want to look at the color, symmetry and border as an initial rule of thumb to try and asses the likelihood of a cancerous or precancerous origin.<br>  <br>  Is it one color or multiple with well defined transitions, i.e. like a mosaic from one color to the next within the border of the lesion?  Light colored lesions (less relevant if you are black or have dark skin as you're more likely to have stronger pigment in the various benign skin features) are generally better and those without sharp color transitions are better (better being less likely to be of a cancerous origin).<br>  <br>  Is the lesion or 'pimple' you refer to symmetrical?  If it is you have less to worry about, however; if the lesion is not roughly elliptical and has poor symmetry about a plain perpendicular to your skin's surface, this is more troubling.<br>  <br>  Is the lesion with well demarcated borders or sharply raised borders- as opposed to a consistent curve such as swelling would produce?  This is more troubling for cancer or precancerous growths as well.  If it is smooth and appears to blend into your skin it is more likely to be something akin to an infection or irritated spot.<br>  <br>  If it looks like it could just be swelling from an infection or something this is better, i.e. if it really could be a pimple and you weren't just using that word generically this is good, if it could be an ingrown hair or small infection or localized reaction to something; all these things are good and less likely to be cancer.<br>  <br>  <br>  You should watch the area and become familiar with your body if you aren't already.  Look a feel around and write down any lesions or suspicious bumps or colorations and watch them.  If this was a sudden appearance and is not with an uneven border, i.e. doesn't suggest a subdermal origin that surfaced, then you likely have nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  Of course everything could be cancer and your always better off checking with a doc in person, but these things could give you some perspective and perhaps some warning signs if you are exceedingly unlucky.  Sounds like either a small infection or body part that has been there all along, but you check it out and take care.<br>  <br>  It could also be one of several sexually transmited diseases.  The relevant types will produce lesions that appear with irregular frequecy and little warning and will persist for variable amount(s) of time before resolving spontaneously.  If you've had many partners you could be at higher risk for such things and it would be best to check it out for treatment options to catch any complications.<br>  <br>  Not trying to scare, but could be anything.  Take charge of your body! :D  And keep notes so you can notice if something is out of the ordinary and with some particularity if you need to get help.|`|dd2e9836cefc2521f95e380d21c45d3aaa	It might be a dermatology issues. I have the same problem, which my doctor said is caused from stress. Basically are they semi-painful bumps that if you pop them, bleed like hell? If that is the case, I'm sorry to tell you to suck it up, you'll have them for life. If it's just started you might get lucky and not have many, if you get many, leave them alone and go see a dermatologist. Unfortunately there is NOTHING at all that can be done for them except to have surgery to remove it, and even then they may come back.<br>  <br>  It's not cancer though, so I think you'll be fine. But like I said, go in and see a Dermatologist!|`|AA11315244	You didn't give enough information about this bump. Is it big or small? Does it itch? Do you shave? All those questions should be answered until you can be referred to another websites that can help!|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	My guess would be an ingrown hair.  Here is an article that could help you with that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-an-Ingrown-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Remove-an-Ingrown...</a>|`|9uAGenc8aa	It sounds like an ingrown hair, very annoying.  Sometimes they can be big.
7CTvtek0aa	First of all you need to tell your parents.  It may be any ovarian cyst which are usually very painful but not life threatening in any way, probably not cancer, statistically you are a bit young to have ovarian cancer.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You are probably ovulating, which can cause a sharp pain like you are describing.|`|AA10457351	Sounds like the pains I used to have when I would ovulate - sometimes I couldn't feel it. However the other times I did feel myself ovulating, it was painful. If you do not want to talk to this about your father, at least go tell your mom. One thing you should remember is that your mom is going to be your best friend when it comes to the changes in your body as you progress through puberty. It's nothing to be ashamed of and, I can probably guarantee that she has felt just like you do now.<br>  <br>  Also, one other word of advice ... Don't look at all the medical sites on the internet! You will only worry yourself sick by doing so ... Talk to your mom & be honest with her about what is going on.|`|YGmmdGD4aa	Honestly, all we on here can do is tell you what we think, but the best choice would be to go to doctor, if you wait until its to late, things could get very very worse|`|hQHWVRyTaa	No idea, get your parents to take you to the flippin' doctor!!!!!
lezn2xG3aa	Talk to your doctor. You may just have dry skin, but I have never heard of that before and I'm a total health nut. It's probably harmless, but just to be safe, you should check with your doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]|`|dyiuwz0qaa	It happens to all of the girls. Its natural.|`|n1hoBuhSaa	That is really weird and kinda of freaky not to be mean i never heard of anything like that|`|QxLN36o0aa	its peeling dead skin cells
3emS6MDmaa	uhm I couldn't say for sure but those can all be signs of Diabetes, GO TO A DOCTOR!
aKBqMLuhaa	IDK my BF is the same way. Well maybe not for that long but he doesn't want to be touched unless its a full on hug.  I on the other hand am ticklish all the time and after I orgasm I'm not at all. My BF could tickle me in my arm pits and it would not make me flinch.  All people are different this is one thing that makes you who you are. Its ok and I don't think you need to do anything about it.|`|VOccyg7daa	Dude, I'm there with you and it sucks.|`|Gw1LLzDgaa	It happens to most (not all) men.  There is nothing you can do about it.   Just cuddle with your partner very gently and let yourself fall to sleep.    Kindest thoughts,    Hermes|`|GTeGDGzKaa	I know the feeling... it is the only time i am ticklish    ........|...  ........|..........SteveC ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|kBSlNEL2aa	Does your girlfriend take this time to get back at you for all of those times you tickled her...yea mine too.|`|OF98s0Xfaa	WHOA!! you gotta be kidding me .... i've never heard this kind of "AFTERMATH" before!|`|K4zsztkRaa	This is very rare but it can happen.   There isn't anything you can do about it, it's just your nerves become sensitive after you orgasm.    -Connor
gvWLgYx4aa	any kind of physical activity will help you lose weight. the only thing though is you have to eat right in order for this to happen. that does not mean starving yourself. it just means staying away from junk and eating healthier foods. limit your portion size, stay away from sodas, and stay away from fast food.|`|KtczrXoqaa	well anytime im in basketball season i usually loose weight just keep up the activity and watch what you eat and you will loose weight.
CuVnpxh3aa	You can sleep which ever way is most comfortable for you. Position has nothing to do with your body. I sleep on my belly. Sleep which ever way you want.|`|OPT5n0Joaa	It's not bad for me because it's the position I slept and I'm comfortable with.|`|oGyL9WJ1aa	Completely safe to sleep on your side.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	If you're very heavy, laying on your back and kill you (all the weight pushing down). People also tend to have breathing problems sleeping on their back for similar reasons (Snoring, etc)|`|kNFH5lKnaa	It doesn't do anything to your body, as long its comfortable for anyone, and for myself.  Usaully laying on your back straight, increase your growth while asleep.  but laying on to the side feels more comfortable. haha|`|UEFd7OOSaa	i don't think it does matter not unless you're quite large but overall no...xxx
wXKs94nDaa	well, it might not be possible but if you eat healthy and workout then you can lose upto 8 lbs no problem.|`|d2s7vAlHaa	Just exercise every day that you can and eat right and you will feel better about yourself no matter what.|`|Sv6CEADSaa	fifteen pounds in forty days?! I can do that in a couple of weeks.  Give up food and start eating cornflakes, period.  You can add milk or soy milk.  drink water and take a multi vitamin everyday while on this diet.  Other then that drink all the wine and beer you want. You'll lose about a pound a day (more if you jog a mile or two)  What i tell people is not to go hungry, that's a diet killer, if you get hungry pull out your bag of flakes and eat.  I just got off a cornflake run and lost eighteen pounds in two and half weeks.  I did jog two miles three times a week.  I've never got a complaint yet instead people tell me how easy it was. good luck.

APCeojqzaa	I had too many pounds in all the wrong zones until I checked out acai berry, I know they say that pills will not work, however they certainly worked for me, and they have been shown on the Rachael Ray Show too. There is a free trial going on at the moment at http://dapunaps.thegmc.com , why not try it, why not?|`|4ek58DIoaa	duh|`|6UKd0Gedaa	yeah, corse it is|`|leneiWBlaa	obviously ive lost that in a week lolz|`|vwoqIUR6aa	if you are really big yes. with hard work and practically starving you can. i would say about 10-15lbs. you should do this the safe-which is still eating but watching what you eat.|`|1Z13L9h2aa	Yes, with proper diet, sleeping and exercise.|`|aauU5mncaa	yes and no. it depends how you plan to loose it. by taking a dietary pill like phentermine you can loose about 1lb a day. if you try to loose weight by eating right and working out it can take a bit longer depending on your body type.|`|OMApFdWnaa	yess  red and green days work well|`|I4z45fzLaa	yes it is.  you have to be commited.   your going to have to work out alot and stick to a healthy diet.    good luck!|`|28c2ea3c0322bf6217fb0995e20e080faa	mIf you are one of the wives of Henry 8th no problem at all.|`|ar9Xylp9aa	The key for losing those excess pounds is not difficult - eat less food and move more often - the problems appear when we actually try to put that into practice! There are plenty of opportunities to fail out there aren't there?! The one thing which really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it really does produce success!|`|dRiBGoJkaa	give me 20 and i'll lose it in a pub cash till in 5 minutes|`|hrFGKAeraa	It is possible.|`|b1feaaa978d115c4f2ff497d30752baaaa	I would try this workout. At the same time you will be gaining muscule and burning fat. So its awesome.       WHAT YOU'LL NEED: Two 5 pounds weights.  * means one 5 pound weight in each hand.    If you don't have two 5 pound weights try using water bottles full of water.      Workout:  Stretch  *20 Bench Press x3   20 squats x3  *20 side arm lifts x3  20 crunches x3  20 push-ups x3  *20 lunges x3  20 leg lifts x3  Walk for 30 mins  Stretch    Stretching before your workout helps you not to pull a muscule during your workout.    Stretching after your workout helps you not be AS sore afterward.     I try to do this everyday, but I'm sure you would get results doing this only 2-4 days a week. I recomend everyday.      Eat 1500 calories a day and drink 8 glasses of water daily.    You will lose weight and tone up!      I've lost 6 pounds and I've only been doing it for a week!      You can do it! i know you can!    You will be sore. and it will hurt but you can do it.    Don't be scared to add more excercises of more reps.      Hope this works for you!|`|HPgYry8Uaa	Yes Check Out This Web Site http://hotshorturl.com/ru71 And Check Out The Testimonials One Woman Lost 75 LBS In 6 Months My Girlfriend Lost6 lbs In One WK .Your question Can I lose  20 Pounds In 8 Wks Yes You Can http://hotshorturl.com/ru71|`|1BviVekbaa	dangerous|`|9JGqFX3Yaa	Yes, I lost 100 pounds yesterday lol|`|9Sgp7Mqmaa	yeah the master cleanse diet, beyonce went on it, for dream girls|`|NUQye468aa	Yes. You can do it by walking a couple of miles a day and eating fresh vegetables, lean meat and fish. Take a few days to work up to the mileage. It's only a mile there and a mile back. The food can taste good too.|`|Ow2ZM7EYaa	Yes.  Do not starve yourself.  It is the worse thing you can do. Keep eating meals at least 3 times a day, but cut back on your portions.  Most people skip breakfast.  Don't, it is the most important meal of the day. Watch what you eat.  Cut out the sodas if you are drinking any. Drink water.  You need to drink 64 oz a day.  Water helps suppress your appetite also.  If you don't care for the taste of water, add lemon.|`|dh4VR3jbaa	pounds of wat fat muscle water weight thats my question|`|mkXF5jA5aa	IT IS BUT IT BE STUPID IF U DID CUz ITS SO DAM DANGEROUS AND EVEN IF U DID THE FASTER U LOSE WEIGHT THE FASTER IT COMES BACK....instead its 1-2 pounds week(i know it seems lyk 4 ever but that's good cuz it wont come back so fast) unless u pig out____hoped i helped u___oh and i almost forgot u can eat a plant called savila but its better to eat it naturally and not take the pill the way u eat it is that u get a small part of the plant u peel it one day u let the goop get out and the next day u eat it. cuz if u eat it lyk that it be way to sour!!! oh and i know this  sounded nasty but u can drink a mix of pineapple,celery,lemon, and basil(i know yuck) but it works and that's what counts

5Qu1pfkraa	Actually our skin is an elastic material.. it can expand and contract..<br>  <br>  but just take a rubber band for example.. if you stretch it and leave it ... it will come back to its original size.. but if you keep it stretched for years together and leave it - it wont return back to its original shape immediately... but after few weeks it will return back to its original shape..<br>  <br>  similarly - our skin gets extremely stretched when we add extra flesh of fat... so when we lose fat... the skin takes double or even triple the amount of time to return to normal than what took to burn fat....<br>  <br>  But - there are certain cases where a 5 foot women weighs 500 lbs and in such cases the skin may not return to absolute normal... but will lose the flabbiness slowly<br>  <br>  cheers,<br>  <a href="http://biglee-murali.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://biglee-murali.blogspot.com</a>|`|0pXBYo4paa	If it's not much, your skin readjusts itself and goes back to it's original shape (remember your skin is naturally elastic). If it's a lot of weight, your skin gets permanently stretched and it hangs there. You will need to have it surgically removed or learn to live with it.|`|rcXmEYoTaa	Our skin streches but when streched too far it will always hang and you'll get stretch marks. <br>  In their case most times plastic surgery is better to cut it all off.|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	if you were as fat as the click dude then you got something to worry about. if your like adam sandler at the beginning of the movie, and you exercise daily, and diet, the body will build muscle, decrease fat, and also pull the skin tighter. <br>  the skin is like a bubble gum bubble. the more air(fat) you fill it with, the bigger it gets, when the air(fat) goes out, the bubble deflates and becomes smaller and tighter. <br>  besides the body can reuse the nutrients in the skin, <br>  <br>  unless your HUGE and get liposuction, or starve yourself, you got nothing to worry about,. <br>  <br>  look at his son, he was fat, then he was super fit.|`|tIldpr7vaa	it depends on how fat u are, most of it will just tighten up.

Anyways there are plenty of preventative and spot treatment products out there. The ones you see on TV ads do usually work by drying them up. I would recommend a kind of cream from Boots called Tea Tree Witch Hazel, it helps to reduce redness and can also prevent spots. Plus is doesn't dry your skin, just put some on over night.    Also, don't scratch it as this will cause scarring and there isn't really a cure for that lol apart from BioOil which is pretty good.

Sit down with a mirror between your legs and compare yourself to a diagram. It won't look exactly the same but everything will be there somewhere. The vaginal opening is below the clitoris, that thing that looks that a little round button underneath a hood of skin.     You have to be in the right position to intert a tampon. Try lying down with your legs wide open or stood with one leg on the toilet seat. The more you relax the easier it will be. If you use the tampons with applicators (the plastic thing to help you insert them), try and lubricate it with a bit of spit! That will help is slip in more easily.     Yeah, it looks small but a vagina can stretch wide enough to let  baby out so it will be able to fit a penis, trust me.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	You really don't have to worry about not being normal.  You are only fourteen, I couldn't use tampons at that age either.  As for masturbating at fourteen, I can't believe you're even bothered about it.  Just take your time and grow up naturally.

There are tricks to tampons sometimes, you man have what is called a tilted uterus, this can make insertion of tampons painful and difficult, try a plastic applicator type tampon, get a mirror and lay on the floor, gently explore with your finger you'll find it, then gently insert tampon aiming towards your lower back, don't go straight, we're not built that way. take  your time . relax.

OoTScJLPaa	sounds like the flu- no 2 flus are the same though<br>  as the flu moves through its hosts, it mutates to deal with that person's level of immunity. after 10 or 20 people, it can get much weaker, and die out, or it can get stronger- strong enough to kill even. thats why when we have a really bad flu season, children and the elderly are encouraged to get flu shots- they have the weakest immune response. the shots contain the still active flu strain that is common at the beginning of the season, the person fights it off (thats why shots make people sick) and builds immunity to the strain. so when the virus mutates into something stronger, the person with the flu shot is less likely to die or even get the flu. <br>  having a fever is normal, since that is your immune system kicking its ***. most viruses can't survive a temperature change of more than a couple degrees, so when you are hot, your body is working hard to kill the flu. you can also die from a really high temp, so you usually get hot then cold. when you're cold, the virus multiplies, and the cycle starts again, until one kills the other. people usually die from the flu when their body temp gets too high or stays high for a long time.<br>  fighting the flu uses alot of energy, so that is why you are sore and tired. drink lots of fluids, as you'll lose alot from sweating when you get hot- even if you don't feel sweaty.<br>  if your temp goes really high, or it has'nt passed in a couple days, go to the doctor- and sit on the other side of the room away from kids and seniors. try not to touch alot in the office- if you can't fight it, they have even less chance.<br>  hope this helped!

Hydrogen peroxide works so well because it can easily pass through your teeth enamel and begin interacting with the dentine and pulp part of your tooth. Studies have shown that this does not harm or effect the enamel part of your tooth and is considered safe by the ADA.|`|NP6ES2GPaa	I have heard of people using it before and I believe the the OTC whiteners use a variant of H202 in them.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	You probably bruised a tendon or ligament.  If so, it takes 3-4 days for the swelling to go down, and a few more days after that to feel normal again.  Putting ice on the finger for about 10 minutes on and 20 minutes off for a few cycles can help reduce the swelling and reduce pain.
dvns8jDaaa	i've just come out of a cast.  I found the best way was to use antiseptic wipes in order to keep the cast reasonably clean. The cast is very easily dirtied and the skin underneath will smell. It's just the way it is.|`|wRtzGgRxaa	It's not uncommon for the skin underneath your cast to be slightly odorous, however, a strong, foul odor should be reported immediately.  Good cast care consists of keeping the cast dry, positioning limb in a way that air can circulate through cast, never putting anything down into the cast, and exercising the parts of your body on the other side of the cast (further away from your trunk).|`|xUtvpHU2aa	Go to the store and get plaster  cleaner for you cast. Hope you like my idea and please rate!
9UvkRIdraa	Last year I started to get a pain in my chest every now and then, and one time it was really bad i almost went to the ER but didn't. My doctor told me that I had something...can't remember the name now lol...but that it was common in people my age (I was 19) and teens. It didn't have to do with my heart, it was with the cartilage in my chest becoming inflamed.  I thought it was something with my heart because it was in my chest around the area of my heart. And he told me to take some ibuprofen 3 times a day, and then it went away.  Teenagers usually don't have heart attacks, it is very rare if they do.  I would try to go to your doctor and see what they say.  That would be the best thing. Hope I helped! :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: He also said that people who had what I had thought they were having a heart attack when they weren't.

There are only a few circumstances where this occurs and all are rare.  Some people are born with congenital abnormalities of the coronary arteries or of the structure and function of the heart.  There is an infection that can lead to abnormalies in the coronary arteries.  Finally genetic familial hypercholesterolemia can lead to premature cardiovascular events such as a heart attack.  You are adopted so you do not know your family history.  Even with familial hypercholesterolemia I am not aware of a single case where a heart attack occurred as early as age 13.  Indeed these people seldom suffer a heart attack until their late 20s or early 30s.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|xoA6cJriaa	Anyone can have a heart attack, but it doesn't sound like you're having a heart attack. Heart attacks are extremely painful and you would be able to tell FOR SURE if you had one.<br>  <br>  But chest pain is not usually a good thing to leave untreated. Tell your parents you are worried about your health, that you would like to see a doctor. Describe to them exactly what you're feeling, too.<br>  <br>  If you can, talk to your school nurse about it, too. He/she may be able to help you out too.<br>  <br>  I hope everything turns out to be a false alarm. Don't get too worried. Being stressed out isn't good for your heart. Find a way to relax. :)

5qwJM2G2aa	I just had my first pap, I was so worried about it and had put it off for years, but you know what? Getting your teeth cleaned at the dentist is worst than the pap. Here's some tips:    Bring a friend, they won't be able to see anything cause a blanket covers you and they can help u keep calm. We were joking and laughing all the way through it. Remember that the doc does this for a living, it's all just profesional and it's not wierd for them to touch u. And also if you are nervous bring an ipod or something to listen to music during it. Relax and it'll be fine :)|`|008512e32e60fcef19c7029ae0dc4d45aa	theres a little discomfort. and its just weird having someone just looking down there. good luck|`|gMPF5z1Qaa	A pap smear feels the same either way.  It is not necessarily pain but it is uncomfortable.  It is a metal object being placed inside of you and held there while they take a sample.  It is a good idea to get one depending on your age and if you are sexually active.  Good luck!|`|Jx3955V9aa	I agree with Brittani.  There might be a small amount of pain...but not really.  The biggest thing is the coldness of the metal, and the awkwardness of someone sticking things in personal places.  They are not that bad though.  We gotta get used to them though, you have to get them your whole life!|`|QQlbvWj4aa	I was pretty nervous before my first pap, but I had a great doctor who explained everything before she did it and went really slow.  It wasn't exactly comfortable, but I couldn't say it hurt.  It just felt... strange.  And it wasn't that awkward, since she was so relaxed about it and just talked the whole time.  Remember, it's what they do for a living.  Nothing they haven't seen before.  Good luck! :)|`|SZFyKlWzaa	Nope it doesnt hurt its just really uncomfortable, but worth it for the BC.
vR7Bew2Xaa	Of course someone will know when there not being themselves.<br>  Or maybe she hasn't completely figured herself out. And is trying to learn who she is so maybe she'll try and act different ways.<br>  <br>  And if someone doesn't want to be themselves, then let her be so. If she's happy let her be, after a while maybe she will realize that she should be herself and then she will be completely happy.<br>  <br>  And you never know if someone is REALLY happy on the inside. I act happy sometimes just to make others happy.
ynjrtIdUaa	My son had RSV at 2 1/2 months.  He was prescribed an Albuterol inhaler to open up his air passages.  Otherwise, it is just a wait and watch virus.  Do the same things you would for a cold...humidifier, sleep inclined, suction nose if needed, and lots of cuddling.    The Tylenol and Motrin are usually for fever.  If you think he is achy or in pain, you could try it.  I don't think it would do any good.    Just watch him carefully.  Some kids need to be hospitalized if their blood oxygen levels start to drop.|`|2gUBpC62aa	One a baby gets RSV, there are no approved medications that can reverse or lessen the virus.  Technically, albuterol isn't even a recommended treatment for RSV, because RSV causes thick mucus in the already inflamed bronchi.  According to the AAP (American Academy of Pediatrics) Oxygen supplement a means of recovery from an active RSV infection if needed.  My doctor told me that Ibuprofen can increase asthma related issues, so ask your doctor before giving your child any additional medication.  Time, fluids and rest will make your child feel better.  Please remember to keep you little on away from other children... RSV is very contagious!  Also, keep in mind that almost all children by the age of 2 get RSV, so you are not alone.  There are some RSV support groups online if you have time to goodly.  Best of luck with your little one!

I also saw on "The Biggest Loser" a couple weeks ago how one contestant was following his diet religiously, exercising 8 hours a day, and was only losing 1-2 lbs per week. His trainer recommended upping his calorie intake to jump start his metabolism. He did and he lost 13 lbs that week. Maybe do a search on that... good luck (personally, I say go buy those clothes now!! 134 sounds like the right weight for someone your height. I doubt you would even notice a difference at 130)|`|Q2dJhKJraa	You are overly obsessed with your weight, you seem perfectly healthy the way you are. <br>  Its nice to have curves, and not a body of bones. <br>  When you think about weight loss alot, you wont loose weight, try to ignore it for a while and seee how far you get, but im sure you look pretty either way:)|`|z5Yn5pJEaa	what i think you should do is to switch up your exercise routine. your muscles are getting used to what your making them do.
PyQhb7gCaa	It's a nutritional shakes which helps you to lose weight by making your calories intake lower and thus at the same time burns your fat, I am using it and I've lost so many kgs and inches ;) it's a miracle. so many people noticing me and asking me what's my secret ;) I just need to tell them, Herbalife! Thanks and credits to Herbalife :) Nopes, no side effects but you can notice that your health improves as well as your eating habit changes to better .. <br>  <br>  Okay I’m sharing with you my own experience .. Actually I consume Herbalife every morning and night, means I replace both my meals and follow it strictly. I take 4 scoops of F1 and 2 scoops of F3 per shake with 400ml of water, which means, 8 F1 and 4 F3 per day. I lost 1kg for the first week. It's just that you must take your shakes well and no cheatings like snacking or eating in between your 3 main meal, breakfast, lunch, dinner. You will feel hungry as your eating style for your shake is not right, that's all. <br>  <br>  I didn't feel hungry at all or have the intentions to cheat and eat when I am hungry. If at all I feel hungry, I eat fruits, that's all. It's just as simple as that. I lost weight with the normal products which you all consume too, the F1, F3 and teamix. I drink 1 litre of tea per day, means 3 to 4 servings per day (250ml per time). You also must remember that when you make your shake, if you add soya or anything to it, you are actually going to add in more calories and sugar into your meal. So try to avoid this kind of things in your diet :) Anyway, it's just as simple as A-B-C.<br>  <br>  Take care and all the best :)|`|Z81bOxq7aa	Never tried it, but heard of it & knew someone who did try it & they lost the weight BUT had some pretty bad side effect, supposedly there are some harmful chemicals in the stuff. But this is only 2nd hand knowledge.  Probably best to just cut out ALL junk & fast food & pop (soda in the states) that alone will make a BIG & I mean BIG difference. Drink more water than you ever have before & that will help flush the digestive system. If you don't go to the bathroom regularly try putting ground (not whole) Flax Seed on salads it will kick start the digestive process also give you the needed omega3's.<br>  JTM&AB|`|eIRoMV6gaa	The key for losing weight is not difficult - consume less and exercise more often - the difficulties appear when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are plenty of temptations in the big wide world don't you think?!

JV8HfDb4aa	Well, I'm sure you know the cast part is simply to immobilize the fracture site.  The E-Stim part is what you are probably curious about.  You'd have to ask your doctor to be exactly sure, but e-stim can be used in combination with the cast to get a desired result (pain relief, bone growth, and prevention of muscle atrophy - muscles shrinking/weakening).  E-stim can have many different settings; each of which is meant to achieve a different result (such as the ones listed above).  <br>  Hope this answers your question. =)

6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	How often are you weighing yourself? And also what time of day? <br>  The best time to weigh yourself is in the morning and it is a good idea not to weigh yourself everyday. Try weighing yourself once a week and tracking the difference that way. Also make sure you aren't wearing any clothes so you get an accurate measure. Maybe you are less stressed right now and that is helping you shed some pounds. The thing with diets is that they don't work. You might lose some weight and you might not but it almost always comes back. If you want to keep losing weight, diet and exercise are the way to go.And by diet I mean have a well balanced diet and following the pyramid.|`|IJrsH2tGaa	Because its harder to lose weight after a certain point. If you are overweight, and have a poor diet, if you all of a sudden start eating well and exercise rigorously, you will start losing weight very fast. But once you reach a certain point, you will stop losing as quick, and may reach a point where you're hardly losing any at all. You should stop looking at the scale. Because when you're on a diet, you are probably in much better health. Even though when you're not on a diet, it seems like you're losing a lot of weight, you are much less healthy.|`|0pXBYo4paa	The diet may have made your body think it was starving, so it went into starvation mode. In starvation mode, your body tries to conserve fat.<br>  <br>  That's why they tell people on diets to eat lots of small meals, so their body won't make the mistake.
08Vk3RtJaa	incontinence is the inability to hold on to your urine (you wet your pants).  if you can hold it but need to go urgently and frequently you could be suffering from a urinary tract infection (UTI) as frequency and urgency are common symptoms along with offensive smelling urine and buring when passing urine.  See your doctor to rule out a UTI.  If that is all clear then it is the muscular function of your bladder that is weak and there many products available and support groups (your dr could refer you) to help.  What ever you do, do not cut down on the amount you drink as this can lead to dehydration and kidney problems|`|ytl2PONXaa	Well I'm a dude and can't use pads.<br>  <br>  Instead we have to tough it out and since I take medication that makes me go pee without warning it basically causes me to run. <br>  <br>  So I suggest that you start trying to hold it longer and maybe your body will get used to holding it (unless you have a serious problem).|`|GQZDcfUiaa	IF, you are female, Kegal exercises may work.

iCqfmRC3aa	It is much more healthy to go without underwear, your vagina will remain cooler, and drier.  Infections, especially yeast infections are produced best in warm, damp environments.  So you are doing your body a favor by losing the pantie lines.<br>  <br>  The following is from a yeast infection website:<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  4. Avoid underwear altogether when possible.<br>  <br>  If you can get away with it, avoid wearing underwear at all. Another suggestion is to wear a loose gown or something that doesn’t bind in the crotch area with no underwear. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  It is also good for your body to take air baths ... that is get outside totally naked ... I know some are going to panic about now, but it is true and so long as you don't overdo the sun it is very healthy. The sun on your skin is good for the synthesis of vitamin D within the body.<br>  <br>  There is a growing body of research suggesting that vitamin D deficiency increases the risk for a host of human cancers, as well as other disorders including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, tuberculosis, and multiple sclerosis.<br>  <br>  However, it is a fact that over 8,000 Americans will die this year from skin cancer, so be careful not to overdo it.  <br>  <br>  And, make sure if you venture outside naked, do it in an appropriate area (unless your back yard is privacy fenced). i.e. nude beach or nudist resort.  If you are under 18 get your parents input.|`|ropZvmRDaa	It is fine to do it in sweats or at home, but out in the public you want to wear your underwear.

jHmF9Ak1aa	I started on OrthoTriCyclen when I was 17. I loved it. In fact I am going back on it now since I have had my baby. ( I was not on the pill when I got pregnant). The side effects are different for most girls. I felt a little nauseous during the first month. I gained a little weight, my boobs got bigger, and my complexion cleared. My friend went on it and had to be taken off because it was causing blood clots and she was having chest pains. I have another friend who gets very sick from the hormones. So, you won't know until you try unfortunately.|`|rhuhp6KCaa	im on orthotricyclin lo, for the first three months or less you might have side effects. I gained a few pounds which didnt affect me because i was a size zero anyway.  You will most likely have more vaginal discharge that could help if you need lubrication during intercourse and can cause yeast infections which r treatable.   You can google "birth control pills" and they can give you a lot more info. <br>  <br>  Ive been on the pill for over a year now and i dont have any problems wt it. It does lighten you period too!<br>  <br>  If you take it in the evening or before bedtime you wont feel any side effects because you'll sleep right through them!  I figured that out after a couple of months, works well so far.

y43tzOQlaa	You'll be okay! I was with a guy for 5 yrs. he swore he was faithful and didn't have any signs either. I got the worst case of Herpes my dr. had seen in his 30 yr. career. I couldn't walk for 4 days or go to work. I too thought my self that life was over. But I was wrong, I met a great guy and was honest with him he was so supportive and understanding. Yes it was embarrassing, but I found that as time went on it got less painful. Take care of your self physically, I haven't had a break out in years. Stress brings on breakouts, we all have the Herpes virus in our bodies, someone can be a carrier of the virus and not know he/she has it. HPV you may have already had also, my daughter tested positive for it at 16. Oh yes I have had children and am married to a wonderful man, life does go on.

7CmkRkEMaa	I use pound measure and 47kg is 104.4 pounds (albeit the proper international measure is kilos). If you do not have any body fat at this weight, it is your proper body weight. When I say no fat that means an appearance of none, but one needs at lease 2% body fat in order to maintain the body structure. No fat just means a vernacular phrase regarding lean muscle mass. Since no one can answer what skin consists of, my view is that it is a fat of some kind. The fat cells below it are still attached to it, and therefore, must be a part of it to some degree. When we split hairs, it starts to leave me cold, but some of the jargon is necessary. It depends on the motive and what works. <br>  <br>  About 40 years ago, observable over-weight was considered unacceptable and people would whisper that they had “a hormonal problem, ate too much (the word “disorder” was not used widely), or it was inherited (genetics was not popular then)” etc. In other words, it was considered abnormal and aforesaid unacceptable. But now with over 65% obese rate in America no one whispers, but thinks instead taking it to another level of acceptance. My opinion is that obesity is a problem of working class buying cheap food whilst the farmers supply it. It is more expensive to eat organic. However, one could still eat raw food even if conventionally (harmful pesticides and hormones [GMO]) grown) and lose weight. But they would have a toxaemia problem. <br>  <br>  Until the farmers stop using harmful pesticides and people wake-up to the intelligent alternative that should be the nomenclature diet of organic raw vegan foodist, the obesity rate will steadily increase. The fast food industry pumps millions of dollars into advertising and it works quite well in their sales.<br>  <br>  Moreover, when your weight is at your leanest muscle mass in my opinion, it is the optimum weight. Those that justify fat are just making excuses for being fat and their undisciplined eating ways. Life is a discipline with exercise an integral part. We must be active or be fat if not eating raw food.|`|8253606e962dc30046c3b40e0678936aaa	Your natural body weight is when you're active to healthy and happy and eat to live.

I know you have to have shots to help produce multiple eggs and I have read that having them removed from your ovary can be painful.  There are many website dealing with this subject and some companies pay many thousands of dollars for healthy eggs.  I do know that the qualifications for donating are strict, like no smoking, no drinking or drugs, healthy weight, etc.  For young women that would like to supplement their income I think it is a worthy cause.  If I were younger would have considered it myself.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|4onT0qUxaa	Aside from the discomfort you might experience during the procedure, I don't think the side effects would be too bad, but obtain as much information as possible from the clinic you are dealing with beforehand. What I would worry about is the thought that there could end up being a child out there that is yours and you would always wonder, wouldn't you? Additionally, if you plan to have children of your own someday you should keep in mind that women are born with a set amount of eggs and once they are gone, they are gone. We don't reproduce them, so there is no turning back. Just make sure you are aware of how it might affect your future before being enticed by the money. It is a huge trade-off, so make sure you are ready for the possible consequences!|`|eAupvb3taa	I did this about 12 years ago. After we were done with kids. You have to be very disciplined & be accessible. There are daily shots you give yourself and many doctor visits. Especially at the end. I had no side effects aside from right before they extracted the eggs, I felt heavy abdominal pressure. I do not regret it and don't know if my eggs were a success or not. I did it to help another who couldn't get pregers on their own and I did it for the money.
obHa7Stuaa	Try it and see. Try one night without chocolate, and the next night with. what happens?
vhr6VXRkaa	Yes.  You are doing just about everything wrong.  You should never only eat one meal a day.  This screws up your metabolism.  Moreover, larger people have generally faster metabolisms.  The whole "fat people have slow metabolisms" line of thought is a myth.  The more you weigh, the faster your body has to burn calories to function.  Think about it:  1 step for you, takes far more energy than it would for someone who is 130 lbs.  People who are overweight tend to eat too much and/or use unhealthy crash diets (like you are doing) to lose weight.   You need to eat small meals throughout the day that contain 200- 400 calories adding up to a calorie range that is between 1,200 and 2,000 (if you need to lose weight you probably should stay around 1,400. Never skip breakfast.  Eat lots of fruits and veggies (plain, no salt, butter or dressing), lean meats, some good fats (avocado, a few nuts, a little olive oil) light/fat free dairy and whole grains.  Do not eat anything packaged, processed or high in salt or sugar.  Don't eat any processed sugar.  In general, you should avoid packaged food, even if it says light or diet. Also, drink plenty of water (at least 8 glasses per day, cut out juice and soda and drink tea without anything in it or just a little honey and lemon or skim milk.  On top of this, the average person walks about 1-3 miles per day.  This is not near sufficient exercise, but rather normal everyday movement.  You should be doing at least a half an hour of cardio at your target heart rate along with weight and resistance training 4-6 days per week.  Talk to your doctor, a nutritionist and/or a trainer.  They should be able to help put you on a good schedule/plan.|`|O3i7zJB2aa	It sounds a lot healthier than most people. Perhaps your insomnia has been caused by your thinking about these health emergencies rather than your diet?  The only thing is, that to only eat one meal a day might be pretty hard to keep up.  You might want to think about joining weightwatchers/slimmingworld because they have healthy eating plans that will suit you and they could answer any questions you have.  But congratulations on getting to almost 2 months, you have very good willpower!    A lot of people are saying that its wrong to only eat one meal a day because your metabolism slows. Actually, there is disagreement over this. Some experts say that your metabolism adjusts to however you eat, it doesn't matter if you snack throughout the day or have one big meal. Back when humans lived in caves we ate one big meal a day, whats the difference?    I think the main issue is, you will get hungry. And also it might break your resolve to see people around you eating 3 meals when you get only one.    Do your own research, there is a link here.|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	are you doing anything wrong? yes... your diet is entirely wrong    one meal a day is slowing down your metabolism rather than "counter-acting" it...    it doesn't sound like you're getting the proper servings of each food group...    by putting your body into starvation mode, it's hanging on to every extra calorie possible...    you need to check with a dietitian for a healthy meal plan|`|ygTr3fvVaa	You're not eating enough. Your body thinks its in starvation mode and is holding on to the fat. Start with a good breakfast, it's the most important meal of the day. Best way to a faster metabolism is to eat, 5 meals a day which would be breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner. Make smart choices of the foods you eat. Try to stay clear of anything processed . Drink lots of water and keep moving. If you move more you'll be tired in the evenings and you will sleep better.|`|MzWM9rBRaa	You're doing it wrong because you're not eating enough... your body goes into starvation mode and stores calories when you don't eat enough. Also you mention sodas, which are simply nothing but sugar which could be responsible depending on how much you actually drink.      A good way to lose weight is to stick around 1200(minimum!) calories minimum, but staying with healthy foods ... get proteins from lean meats like chicken and fish.  You need protein to lose weight.|`|qky1Q90xaa	Two major mistakes stand out immediately. First, one meal a day is what is preventing weight loss and is the cause of your insomnia. You have to eat multiple small meals every day to boost your metabolism. Eating once a day only slows it, and your body enters 'starvation mode,' saving every calorie you give it. Small meals throughout the day (especially breakfast) is what will make you metabolism faster.  Next, caffeine intake is fine (and most studies show it is good for you in moderation). It is a vasodilator which increases circulation to your brain and throughout the rest of your cardiovascular system. Pairing it with sugar is a bad idea, however. Try eliminating sodas from your diet entirely if possible. Refined sugars are one of the biggest (and most overlooked) causes of weight gain. Most people do not need pure sugar during the day, so your body will store it as glycogen or fat. Avoid all refined sugars. You can get plenty of healthy carbohydrates to satisfy your body's needs. Check the back nutrition panel off ALL the items you eat and drink to monitor your sugar intake (less sugar is always better except during intense exercise).  In determining a healthy appearance, feel, and lifestyle, simple bodyweight is not necessarily the best indicator. Especially if you start exercising when you have not previously had a routine, or if you suddenly increase your exercise regiment, you may not see a rapid change in weight. This is because as you exercise, your body undergoes muscular and neuronal growth, which may actually increase weight, offsetting any fat loss. This will likely be the case for the first 6-7 weeks or so if you are moving to a more healthy lifestyle that focuses more on exercise. You should slowly start to see more muscle tone at that point, and you WILL become leaner. More immediately, you she see improvement in strength and performance.  Dieting is also a dangerous path to follow. Instead, focus on a healthy lifestyle that balances food and exercise. Lean meats and a lot of fruits and veggies will help with that. Try to eat no more than 20% or your daily caloric needs worth of fat in order to lose fatty mass. Especially in our society, carbohydrates often have more to do with weight gain that anything else, so make sure your carbohydrates are complex carbs (whole grains, stone ground, no "white" bread or rice, or as little as possible). Whole grains keep you more full longer and take longer for your body to digest. They do not create the spikes in blood glucose (BGL) that simple sugars, white flour, or starchy products will. This means that less insulin will be produced by your pancreas after each meal, and therefore less fat will be stored. Another positive effect is that is reduces your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Depending on your goals, your balance of calories will determine how your body changes. If you want to avoid gaining additional weight or lose weight, a good ratio would be something like 40% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 20% fat. Also make sure to read the labels on any food you buy. They tell you much more than the advertisements like "low fat" on the front of the box. A long-term lifestyle change that you can maintain will be MUCH for effective that a diet (after dieting, your body tries to return to its original weight, which is very hard to combat).  The most dramatic difference you can make is with exercise. Walking is alright to begin, but when you can you should bump it up. Try running for short intervals, then increase the length when you can. Also, weight training will lead to a more dramatic difference because you burn more calories even at rest. Cariovascular training is important as well, most most calorie burning takes place only while you exercise. Adding some lean muscle to your frame (replacing fat) will increase your metabolism drastically. It will burn calories while you rest and even while you sleep. This is because exercise induces the consumption of carbohydrates, while resting release hormones that metabolize fat. You actually burn a higher percentage of fat while at rest (though not an absolute amount - exercise is more calorie-intensive), so muscle that consumes more energy at rest will consume more fat.  Remember, weight is a very loose guideline for overall health, and healthy weight varies from person to person.  The big word for you to remember is commitment. Patience with this will be your strongest benefactor. It may take a while, but you should ultimately be very happy with your results, and you will stay that way instead of dieting and relapsing backward every time. Statistically speaking, the slower and more consistently you lose weight, the better time you will have keeping it off. This is a lifetime commitment, and you have to look at it that way. Good luck!|`|9447ec0e8007cf2d3317bbce5b349972aa	The first person that answered is exactly right - you are not eating frequently enough.  You have to keep your metabolism going to lose the weight, you are doing the exact opposite by not eating regularly.  You should always eat breakfast, this starts your metabolism for the day, then eat something small and nutritious ever 3-4 hours.  When you are asleep, you are essentially fasting for 8+ hours, so your body stops burning fuel (metabolism slows) because it thinks it is in starvation mode, it is going to hold onto all the calories it can b/c it doesn't know when it will receive more calories-this is why breakfast is so important.  Same thing happens when you are awake if you don't keep fueling the fire with food, the fire will burn out = metabolism slows.  GoOd LuCk To YoU!|`|PwxREEQPaa	Well, to make a long answer short, just change your diet completely!! Instead of eating one meal or 3 large meals a day, spread it out. Eating on to 3 large meals a day is NOT going to boost your metabolism and it will cause you to wanna snack on just inbetween meals. Plan your meal out for the week and whatever you don't have on your list, go to the grocery store and get it. Try to stick to really lean meats like boneless skinless chicken breasts. Eat organic fruits and veggies.  Eat like 6 to 7 small meals a day, but do not eat after 7pm. For example, Breakfast: Have a glass of skim milk with a whole wheat bagle with low fat or fat free cream cheese, plain or flavored and have a cup of organic fruit. For a snack in between that and lunch, have a you could have a cup of fruit, or yogert, a fruit popsicle bar, and then for lunch have cesar salad with come chicken cut up in it and fat free dressing and for desert, have a mini strawberry shortcake with fat free cool whip. And for a snack in between that and supper, have a like a slimfast or specail K chocolate energy bar. Supper, you could have whole wheat spaghetti noodles and organic spaghetti sauce. And for an after supper snack, but before 7pm, have some cottage cheese with some peaches. Cottage is high in protein and if you have a lot of protein before you go to bed, your body actucally work better in taking in that protein and boosting your metabolism while your sleeping. Exercise daily or start off everyother day with walking a half an hour, do crunches, cardio works great. Hope my information helps!! Make sure whatever you do, have a lot of protein, that is what is gonna up your metabolism and make for effective weightloss. Plus, protein helps keep you full longer.

I found that sliding my glasses down my nose a bit (yes, like an old fogy) cleared the print right up!. If you wear contacts, they now have multifocal contact lenses that are similar to bifocal glasses. I haven't tried them, but I hear they take some getting used to.|`|AA12392755	I first noticed at 6 when I started school.

It's merely legal and sold OTC in many places. <br>  <br>  It is an incredibly powerful substance in it's own right that more than holds its own in comparative effects to other illegal drugs such as LSD. <br>  <br>  DXM is certainly easier to dose as you know exactly how much and what your are getting. Also, the experience can be very intense, although perhaps not as useful for working through issues as other psychedelic compounds. DXM is not a pure psychedelic such as LSD or Mescaline and is more frequently categorised as a dissociative, being structurally similar to PCP and Ketamine. <br>  <br>  In high doses SWIM mentions that experiences can include:<br>  * Out of body experience<br>  * Intense feelings of connection to the universe<br>  * Feelings of extreme time dilation to the point where time stops being a linear thing<br>  * Extreme evaluation of deep parts of ones own psyche (be warned)<br>  * Feelings of being more 'connected' to other types of 'reality' such as the world of the dead or alien dimensions<br>  <br>  Essentially, it can break down your ego and **** with your mind in a phenomenal, even life changing way. SWIM would probably say however that DXM isn't really as useful for learning or working through personal issues as classic psychedelics. DXM is more about the experience. <br>  <br>  Be careful - DXM can kill. Make sure you look at some dosage charts to make sure you are taking a safe dosage for your weight and be warned that a small percentage of the population are hyper sensitive to the effects of DXM so if it's your first time - start small. <br>  <br>  The effects of a 'cough syprup hangover' are also quite unpleasant. <br>  <br>  One seems to build a fairly rapid tolerance to DXM and addiction is possible.<br>  <br>  Be safe, have fun.|`|dUeDmb7raa	yea tussin's fun<br>  <br>  <br>  i did all that stuff when i was underage<br>  <br>  <br>  now i just drink<br>  <br>  <br>  but sure, it could make for a fun night|`|AkVT4nbvaa	Ugh that is soooo white trash.

cqvh15Tbaa	You should really go and ask your medical doctor to run a few food intolerance tests to find out why your stomach is filling with gas so quickly after you eat.    <br>  <br>  If you have recently undertaken a course of antibiotics then you should take some probiotics to rebalance the 'good bacteria' in your intestine.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you tell your physician exactly when the symptoms started and whether you have easy or difficult bowel movements when you go to the toilet.   You may be told that you have irritable bowel syndrome if you have diarrhoea.   <br>  <br>  If you're not happy with the answer provided by your doctor then make sure you get another opinion.

Or if you see the doctor he/she can prescribe you prescription antiperspirant, or last case scenario you can have botox injected into your armpits to stop you from sweating completely. Good luck|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	this happens to me and i have no clue wat to do about it so im putting this in my watchlist|`|WW59n5Lqaa	u would have 2 take these shots 2 stop it from sweating! but i dont no where u have to go to take these shots???i think u should ask ur mom!*-*|`|2980154e6aba2d32a68ce69312849543aa	aw..... man!

It should settle down once you are really out of puberty.  Use an "anti-persprirant".  They are better than plain deoderants which just hide the smell.|`|Avbh2QEeaa	it's actually quite normal...don't worry.....it's called hyperhidrosis.<br>  u can learn more about it here  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidros...</a>|`|7gpAdJGaaa	TRY POWDER OR RAISING YOUR ARMS HONESTLY I THINK YOU ARE NORMAL SO YOU SWEAT GOOD FOR YOU|`|1UD6eEvwaa	Sweating is sweating.

Put deodorant on at night, it will help because your body has time to help it soak in.  Second, I've found "certain dry" to help, you put this on at night before you go to bed too.  Otherwise you can go to your doctor and get a prescription deodorant and that would help too.  I'm looking forward to see some other answers!

cyxbfPuEaa	It depends on how you cut them.  Cutting straight across the wrist would be ineffective.  When people cut their wrists, they are severing (or attempting to sever) their radial artery, which is a fairly large artery.  If it is cut straight across and all the way through, the artery will constrict and draw back into the wound and very effectively stop the bleeding fairly quickly.   If the artery is cut long ways, the bodys own defense (the artery constricting) will actually pull the cut open and cause it to bleed more profusely.  Take a piece of hose, and make a small slit down the middle, then pull from each side of the hose, the cut opens up, same concept  Death from exanguination (bleeding out) from your radial arteries would not be very quick.  First heart rate goes up, you become pale, clammy, lethargic, dizzy, lightheaded.  Then you start to become short of breath, like starving for air and you cant get a full breath, eventually your blood pressure starts to drop until you loose consciousness.  Finally, you will have lost so much blood that theres not enough left in your cardiovascular system to circulate to your organs and you die.  This process could take hours, or minutes.  The wrists, could take up to an hour or more|`|4QmfnkrKaa	well i cut both mine really deep right across the arteries and i am still here but i did end up in hospital for 9 days and need blood transfusions, right now i know 8 people who have tried suicide this way and they are al still alive too so its probably hollywood for you but i can tell you it is painful the whole time and even worse when the cuts start to heal|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	oh please, do you also believe that people can fly?  that's in the movies too.|`|iEHdNepJaa	IF you could manage to do it right, I suppose you could be passed out in as little as a few minutes.|`|VOccyg7daa	Depends on how and how deep you cut yourself. It would take a little bit of time though.|`|ciqAXgCgaa	wow holly crap your feet are touching your head that is amazing!  and idk i geus it depends on you and how deep you cut it.    EDIT:  and just curious, do you ever bend and stuff when your gettin it on?  that would be so interesting.|`|4c7QomPoaa	For one it's a movie, and they're only going to show as much as they want to for dramatic effect.  As far as in real life, it would depend on the depth and direction of the cut, as well as other factors.  Pain it going to be there, unless you anesthetize yourself some way. Access the movie "The Mechanic" (from the late 70s) if you want a movie type explanation for it!  LOL|`|yCR6qg0baa	It's slow & painful. The time it takes you to bleed to death would depend on how deep you cut & what direction you did it. Plenty of people (esp. teenagers and women) slit their wrists and don't die.    I also saw a movie on lifetime where this girl tried to poison her uncle & her aunt caught her, so she slit her wrist (only one) and died in like 30 seconds. That's hollywood for you.|`|f8c56ef7aba0fc888b7b7d0c7ba60eceaa	More often than not, people who attempt to kill themselves by slitting their wrists end up living. When you slit across your arteries in your wrist, the blood flow is extremely low. In many cases, if you don't cut deep enough, it might even scab over before you lose enough blood to die. You'll just faint for a few hours and wake up with your lower arms covered in blood. If you do cut deep enough, however, it's slow enough that someone might find you before you die.    Anyway... I don't assume you are asking for personal reasons. If you are, seek guidance.
hsEo77F9aa	There have been no documented cases of HIV being transmitted by kissing. Yes, it is theoretically possible, but has not been documented. With all the kissing going on in the world, if kissing were a mode of transmission, we would be seeing a much different disease trend.    We can never say HIV can NEVER be passed through making out, because there is an exchange of saliva (which can't transmit HIV) and saliva may contain small amounts of blood.But that blood would have to find it's way into your blood stream which is hard to do from the mucosal membranes found in the mouth.  After 25+ years of epidemiological data, we are as close to saying it is no risk than we ever will be.      These types of situations (where it is theoretically possible, but hasn't been documented) have made for the creation of a new category (Theoretical Risk, sometimes called, No Real Risk or Negligible Risk).    No risk activities - no exchange of required body fluids, no docuemtned cases  Theoretical Risk - an exchange, or possible exchange, of the required fluids, no documented cases  Low Risk - exchange of required body fluids, relatively small number of cases with respect to high risk activities  High Risk - exchange of required fluids, the majority of infection have occurred from these activities.    The vast majority of HIV infections occurred from unprotected vaginal sex, followed by unprotected anal sex, sharing needles/equipment. Outside of these areas, HIV transmission rarely occurs.     HIV is not as easy to transmit as everyone believes. In fact, it is quite difficult in comaprison with many other transmissable infections.    The ONLY common body fluids that can transmit HIV infection are:  BLOOD  SEMEN  RECTAL SECRETIONS  VAGINAL SECRETIONS  BREAST MILK  or fluids VISIBLY stained with any of the above    I know many people who are living with HIV and some who are living with AIDS. There is so much stigma out there about people with HIV/AIDS that it can be very difficult to deal. Misinformation about how HIV is transmitted makes people irrationally fear those with HIV/AIDS for no scientific or logical reason. I have personally made out (and possibly went further, lol) with 3 people living with HIV (at least, 3 people who disclosed their HIV status to me.....I don't rely on an HIV+ person to disclose, nor do I expect them to in every situation --- I use protection regardless).   By broadly excluding people who are HIV+ from those with whom you would be initmate with, you are limiting youself . And I might add, how will you know if your partners are or aren't HIV+.....30% of people with HIV/AIDS in North America have no idea they are infected!!!!! You can't rely on someone knowing their status, you have to assume that they may have it until you know for sure (getting tested together)!    Learn some more about HIV, here:   http://www.aidsguelph.org/hiv-101---what...    and find out how some sex-related activities are classified based on risk, here (It's called the Safer Sex Menu, and it is brilliant!):     http://www.aidsguelph.org/safer-sex    Hope this helps|`|kxFNIktMaa	No you can't get HIV w/ just kissing or hugging, only genital to genital contact|`|PeH8ITJFaa	No you can't unless.. the person has open cuts or sores.  If they don't then you are safe because you have less than 1% chance of getting HIV from saliva|`|SOxdyWQOaa	yes|`|BPuyPpNkaa	Unless the person with HIV has open lesions and soars on his/her mouth and you touch these open lesions and soars then put them on some open soar or lesion on your body, then NO, you can't get HIV from making out.

Just remember that if you choose to get intimate with this person, you then have to be a little more cautious.|`|nhVLNeXHaa	Well, yes or no...you cannot get HIV/STD's without either semen or blood transfuation...However, if that person who is infected with HIV and you made out with that person, but if he/she have any cuts or opening sores in his/her mouth, there is a higher risk of the possiblity of being infected with HIV, but if there are no blood exchanged, then you won't get it. But I highly recommend you not to make out with anybody else who are infected if you really highly value your life and your future.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	i am not an expert consult a doctor|`|H3GrDAXPaa	no
Z0GIwoP6aa	Just to verify everyone's teeth are not like that...  and you shouldnt have to live with it... When I was a kid I fell and chipped one of my front teeth...it wasnt very big or noticable so I never bothered getting it fixed (thinking it would cost a lot and take forever) but one time during my regular teeth cleaning my dentist recommended that I let her file it down..it took about 30 seconds and I didnt feel a thing (and she did it for free...Idk if your dentist will but it must not cost that much if my dentist just gave it away! lol)   But if you have braces you should probably let your teeth straighten out before doing any filing..bc if you file them now and then they shift positions you will have to file them again..and you definately dont want to file them too much!  So if i were you I would wait until my braces were off and then get them filed.|`|J6lnsOdYaa	If you are concerned, you should go to the orthodontist.

hPdEZ4Ypaa	Cymbalta is an SSRI. As is Prozac, Effexor, Welbruten, Celexa, Zoloft, and countless others. I don't take any prescription medication for depression at all. I take the herbal equivalent Saint John's Wort. Never mix the two, though.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	I was on that dosage but it worked more on my fibromyalgia than it did for depression for me. And one side effect was weight gain for me. I gained about 20 pounds and I can't do that because of my artificial leg not fitting properly. (I gained the 20 within 2 months- not good)|`|GERrhExAaa	I am on 30mg right now and so far it works fine.  It doesn't give you the complete calm as some of the others do, but it also doesn't mess you up like the others do.<br>  <br>  Ive read some bad stories about Cymbalta withdrawal that you can read on www.erowid.com.  That worries me a bit.  Anyway, I have to take it at night because it makes me dizzy during the day, other than that, it's working just fine.|`|ig0miCndaa	i am on Cymbalta.  I am now on 30, but need 60 when I am really stressed.  it works very well for me.
8d7wa1OYaa	I used to think mine wiggled about as well...they don't anymore though. I dunno if they really did or I was imagining it.    And the bleeding is because you're not brushing enough. If there is a build up of plague you will bleed when it is removed. It's nothing to worry about, but brush more often and it'll bleed less.    Go to the dentist anyway, it's best to be sure, and you should be having a check up every 6 months or so regardless of if you thinks there's a problem.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	okay start brushing your teeth often gentli if they hurt, go to the dentist im sure its nothing to worry about though,gd luck ( you may want to put your question in the dental category next time though) hope i helped|`|v6Ehreizaa	Go to the dentist, it is not normally for your teeth to wiggle back and forth easily.|`|b9wICW1Paa	It sounds like more of a dietary problem than one with brushing.  Loose teeth is one symptom of a condition called Scurvy, which is caused by Vitamin C deficiency.  Other nutrient deficiencies could also lead to these symptoms.      You should definetely see a dentist, but you should also look to improving your diet.  Focus on whole foods such as fresh fruits, fresh and cooked vegetables, whole dairy products, eggs, quality meats, grains, and legumes.      Overreliance on soda and other junk foods can actually exacerbate these deficiencies.  Try to minimize or eliminate them from your diet.

It just doesn't bother me.<br>  <br>  Hes probably just a jerk. The thing about blood means absolutely nothing, as plenty of people are fine around it.

wfDzUSItaa	If you eat right before a workout you could get some cramps. Your body increases blood flow to the stomach during digestion causing muscles to cramp when you exert them. Something small a half hour before shouldn't be a big problem though.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	**** that eat now.<br>  <br>  <br>  and then yes eat before you workout, but big meal at least 1-2 hours before, snakc 30 min beofre or you risk puking, igh.  but seriously eat now|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	You definitely need to eat something before you go run in the morning. The only problem with eating is that you could throw up. But, that breakfast is perfect.

Was it worth it, would you do it again, how did it make you feel as a human being.  The difference between humans and all other living creatures is the ability to know the difference between right and wrong.  When we do wrong there is something deep inside us that lets us know that it was wrong to do and that it hurt others when we did it or had the capacity to hurt others.  All human beings want to do whats right but they also have wants, desires, and urges that can make them do the wrong thing out of selfishness.  When we do wrong and regret what have done there is a large amount of guilt that goes with it.  Can we learn from this and do right the next time or will we be selfish again and do whats wrong.  Sometimes it becomes a game with people for them to see how much they can get away with, and the more they get away with the higher they get off the adrenaline.  But sooner or later it all catches up with them and they crash and burn.  All the people they let down and rules that they broke can not be reversed.  When you do wrong ultimately you have to live with the consequences and most of the time the consequences are not worth that moment of instant gratification that you get when you act only for yourself with no regard for other living things.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	This is one of those questions that require an answer to the question that was not asked.  <br>  <br>  Temptation is a verb and not a noun.  Therefore, the strength to resist temptation goes beyond the static answer that you seek.<br>  <br>  Americans have lost their collective discipline towards temptation, but I haven't.<br>  <br>  I will contest to you that I am one of the most disciplined you will ever know.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	I firmly believe that I can't be tempted by anything and I have yet to be proven wrong.|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Faithful to the things that really matter.|`|qbstgPcbaa	my temptation: CHOCLATE =) haha
NzSA6dmyaa	your know tea has only slightly less caffine than coffee, your in for a real caffine crash later. i wouldnt drink anymore 2day|`|8cDd70dSaa	Well, tea has caffeine in it also, so if anything, you're only going to get more energized.|`|oHGvoaiTaa	What i advise ppl with coffee addictions, or even caffeine addictions, is to start drinking black, green or white tea. these are the most common, best tasting (for me the white tea) coffined teas. after one gets used to those, they can start drinking other teas out of habit.   an interesting fact about those teas is that they are all from the same plant, just handled differently.  also, green tea detoxifies your body, a litre a day is what kept me going.  what u should know is that hose teas also cause a slight loss of appetite, for a male thought not tragic, but a woman should watch out if shes already skinny. (I drank 2 litres a day to loose wait, worked fabulously!!!)
VB3ZK5f9aa	You are not having food poisoning.  If you were, you would be vomiting plenty, with no finger.  What you have done, and getting heavy saliva, means your stomach is empty.  Nothing more to vomit.  Anything you ate will come out the other end.|`|eAupvb3taa	If you have food poisoning, your body will let you know when it's time to throw up or sit on the toilet. Let nature take it's course. You may just have a stomach ache and be fine or you may puke for a day. You never know.|`|4hsrILZbaa	If you had food poisoning you'd be vomiting....horribly...and maybe having some explosion out the other end as well. Making yourself throw up will not change the outcome if you had food poisoing. By then the bacteria is already in your digestive system, in your body, and making you sick.<br>  <br>  I had food poisoning...I threw up for days, and couldn't eat anything but crackers for weeks. You probably FEEL sick because you think you have food poisoning. Stop trying to throw up.|`|AS8VyrVgaa	no. dont make yourself throw up. <br>  BAD!!!!!!!!!
AG9msdUDaa	A GP can give you any psychiatry medications you want. You can go in with a list of any symptoms as well, and get whatever you want, you don't even have to actually have any of them. There is no scientific test for psychiatric diagnosis. Psychiatrists follow the same diagnostic process, so it doesn't matter who you go to. I have been to both and both will throw pills at the supposed 'mental health' problem, even if there really isn't one.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Yes to both questions.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Yes to both questions. This is where you start with help through medication if needed and also any referring to counsellors that will be made. Medication is only used until which time the underlying issues are dealt with.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Sure.. I guess.  But social anxiety is not a disease.  It isn't even a mental illness.  There isn't any medicine that will take it away.  Behaviour changes and working on one's self confidence is the key.  It is a personality trait that can be adjusted... it is not a disorder like there is something 'wrong'.  That is all garbage made up by the happy pills company to make you believe every little thing that isn't perfect in your life has a pill as a cure.|`|tz6ksGFkaa	Probably.  I would go in there with a list of your symptoms and tell your doctor what you think the problem is - social anxiety. <br>  I know they will for depression.  I believe they also give antidepressants for social anxiety so I don't see why not.|`|pa7rzc8Qaa	When I was diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, it was by a general physician at the health center on my college campus (I was 21 at the time). She also prescribed meds for me. I'm almost positive that any doctor can diagnose and help treat this condition.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	As long as you're over 18 they can, but I wouldn't trust a family doctor to do so. I've known many people with emotional disorders who decided to use a family doctor to prescribe medicine and had bad experiences (more often than not). Family doctors are very generalized and are not trained to deal specifically with an emotional disorder. It's best to get a psychiatrist who specializes specifically in social anxiety, they'll be more understanding about the disorder and will have experience with medications. If you do get a family physician to do it, be sure to research medications and your symptoms on your own before hand.
c55O7jqXaa	keep icing it until you can't stand it anymore and slowly stretch it out . This is all you can do and hope for the best tomorrow. Even fill the bathtub with ice and water if need be and put your leg in. This is what they do for athletes and it helps so much.|`|RzaVCA2Yaa	i used to have a march fracture when i played lacrosse and my foot hurt pretty badly all the time, so i took an ibuprofen before practice. it helped a lot to reduce the pain, so you can ice it like the other person said tonight and take an ibuprofen or 2 tomorrow like an hour before practice.<br>  <br>  make sure you dont take it on an empty stomach because it can irritate your stomach.
H2bFiDNAaa	well if u have fair skin, proactive or any other acne cleansers basically aren't going to work. I tried proactiv and it made my skin dry, red, and irritated. i thought i just wasn't used to it but even after a month it was still like that. but even if u don't have fair skin, proactiv won't work for everybody- don't trust commercials|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Seriously, get back on the full dose of sertraline. Your face will clear up in time, your mind won't.........cheers|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Proactive doesn't ruin your skin or leave scars.  Maybe when the swelling in your face went down you realized you had scars (to the other poster).  I understand about the Zoloft fear but it's not the Zoloft doing it.  It's stress and emotional problems that are causing your body to overproduce the gunk that gets in your hair follicles and gets them infected.  You need to keep using the Proactive as it tells you to.  But also use an anti-dandriff shampoo extra strength or get a doctor to prescribe it for you.  I think you might have infected hair follicles on your scalp - you'll need a doctor to prescribe antibiotics for that or it won't go away with anything else you try.  Good luck and keep taking your medications!|`|JF73mc81aa	Poactiv isin't for everyone, some people can have a sensitive skin and benzyle peroxyde isin't good for that or sometimes the skin need to be claned...but not too often, try using it once a day, 5-6 days per week|`|SrEbq98maa	hey if u wana get rid of acne and other skin problems <br>  like tanning,blemish,darkspots and tatoo problem ,try<br>  <a href="http://acnecaretipz022.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://acnecaretipz022.notlong.com</a>               <br>  and u ll find tips to get rid of acne,blemishes,dark spots and all your skin problems|`|jc54FPEMaa	If its doing that stop using Proactive.

0nyWiro9aa	By the three types do you mean the hypoglycemic low blood sugar, the high blood sugar hyperosmolar non-ketotic, and the ketotic acidosis?<br>  <br>  The low sugar in one is where the person awakes from the coma with the administration of glucose into an IV. A blood sugar is obtained in all cases and if high then a beta-hydroxybutarate level (ketone) is performed. If the level is high then one has hyperglycemic ketoacidosis first suspected on the chemistry panel with a low C02 indicating acidosis with an anion gap and the presence of ketones. In the field some of these patients can have a fruity odor. The other type normally seen in type 2 diabetes is strictly a high glucose level leading to abnormal brain function (hyperglycorrhachia) in addition to symptoms of hyperosmolarity (high sugar). These sugars can get really high.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	That is if you know the coma is caused by diabetes. What if there is something else that is causing coma? So in any case of coma in ER, always a drug to fight off overdose of narcotics is given. In all the diabetic comas first the dehydration has to be dealt with. sometimes it takes about 6 to 8 liters of normal saline to bring them out of dehydration. And then they will deal with the sugar very slowly.|`|e8Sgp92naa	First check the blood sugar.  Low blood sugar must be treated immediately to prevent brain damage.  If low give glucagon or IV dextrose if available.  <br>  <br>  If the blood sugar is high give insulin and fluids.  <br>  <br>  If you're not sure, always treat as if low.  You can save someone's life.
yDJiiqcsaa	Yes, it's yeast. When you took antibiotics to help with the B.V. in Oct. it upset the balance of bacterial/fungus(yeast).  When the med "killed off" the excess bacteria the fungus (yeast) flourished as they hold each other in balance. Go to Walmart and buy Miconazole nitrate cream (Vulvar cream) or if you are a believer in brand names - Monistat cream and put it on your anus (you can push a little just barely inside also). If not better in 3 days - doctor.  On the other hand - if your anus is swollen/protruding - it could be hemorrhoids. If no swelling/protrusion or history of hemorrhoids - it is most likely yeast.|`|gMPF5z1Qaa	It could be hemorrhoids related or unrelated to the infection.  See what the gyn says.  Don't stress over it.  Good luck!

RZetcwalaa	Im thankful you have noticed it before it gets to late, although its sounds so stupid many people are alcohol dependant before they even realise, i have been drug dependant since i was 15, i have been using alcohol and/or solvents on and off (but never more than a month off) for more than two years, i can tell you it is a personal hell, drinking anything up to 3 bottles of cider/14 cans of beer or consuming 6 aerosol cans.<br>  <br>  And in some sort of twisted irony all the time denying that i had a problem, i even had to call an ambulance when my heart starting beating irregularly after prolonged solvent abuse, so they said it may be helpful for me to go to the hospital for further observations, instead i went in and started drinking.<br>  <br>  Alcohol addiction is pretty serious, and you don't have to be drinking everyday for it to be dependency, i was drinking for breakfast, and for dinner, its ridiculously expensive and i guarantee WHEN you stop you will see how much more money you have.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the only thing for a dependant to do is stop, i really don't think you will be able to 'cut down' i tried this many times, but inevitably you just gradually increase your intake over a period of weeks.<br>  <br>  You should go and see a doctor and/or school counsellor (im not really sure how the system works in the US) but whatever you do make sure you get help. You seriously don't want to end up in my pathetic situation, i think its a testimony to the situation of alcoholic that no self confessed alcoholic actually wants to drink.<br>  <br>  You should tell your Friends (or even parents) about your situation because they're inevitable disapproval will probably help you to stop, <br>  <br>  Like i said if you can get help from a Professional, try to share your problem with other people, try to find other things to do (not entirely sure what) and do not substitute your addiction with something else eg. smoke weed instead of alcohol, this will not work....<br>  <br>  I have two years behind me, you (by the sounds of it) have only a few months, be thankful you have realised and just try your hardest to stop before it gets worse, because beleive me it will get worse.<br>  <br>  i beleive you frequent R&S so here is a bit of an andvanced pascals wager for you 'better to beleive it is alcahol dependancy and save yourself now, than to to beleive it isnt and end up worse'<br>  <br>  <br>  severity of dependancy quiz<br>  <a href="http://www.liverinfo.org.uk/SADQ/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liverinfo.org.uk/SADQ/</a> <br>  <br>  (**** i got established dependancy)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/alcohol-use/alcoholuse-alcoholic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehealthmd.com/library/alcohol...</a><br>  <br>  (i hope your results are not as worrying as mine)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alcoholscreening.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alcoholscreening.org/</a><br>  <br>  (this one is similar to the other one but compares your results to the whole US population)<br>  <br>  ok here are some sights to do with alcohol, even if you arent yet dependant it doesnt meen your usage is acceptable, im sure you are drinking well beyond the recommended limit.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice/facts/alcoholism.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/health_advice...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/23069189/" rel="nofollow">http://www.patient.co.uk/showdoc/2306918...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Please take this seriously, and if maybe me and you are over reacting no harm is done.

For example<br>  <br>  Yoga<br>  Swimming<br>  Photography<br>  Or any other activity that you find to your satisfaction.<br>  <br>  If your really craving alcohol then there are plenty of alternatives.

You should get measured, but keep in mind that not all bra companies use the same cup standards when making their bras. Some companies you'll be a C cup and some companies you'll be a D cup or even an F cup...

If so you might have a hormone imbalance.

Be willing to address issues where you have been less than honest in the past, whether you took a cookie and then denied it, or blatantly lied about whose fault an automobile accident was. While reviewing your past transgressions can create discomfort and guilt, recognizing where you have been dishonest in the past can help you identify patterns and stop them from continuing.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you feel guilty for having been dishonest in the past, apologize to the person you lied to and/or find a creative way to make things right. For example, if you kept money that you knew wasn't yours and didn't make a good faith effort to return it to its owner, make an equivalent or greater donation to charity. If you've lied to a person who plays an important role in your life (a significant other, relative, or friend) the best (but most difficult) thing to do is come clean. <br>  List the areas where you may have a weakness. It may be as simple as a tendency to make up excuses for failures, or as complicated as a penchant for stealing. Remember that dishonesty is rooted in fear, so you must look for and face those fears. By listing areas where you have a problem, and then working to deal with them, you can consciously battle these habits. If you find yourself lying because you fear disapproval from someone, for example, perhaps you need to learn how to stop being a people pleaser and be yourself. Most importantly, admit your errors so that you can forgive yourself and use those experiences to reinforce your determination to do better. You can't fix what you don't acknowledge as a problem.

2vkVQ3F6aa	I used to be a cutter, and sometimes the urge is still there... the reason we cut is because some people prefer to deal with literal, physical blood and pain that we can see and understand instead of struggling internally.      It is an addiction like any other, in that we do this to run away from our issues and distract ourselves.    If a doctor or nurse feels that you are a threat to yourself or others, they are able to admit you for a short period of time (anywhere from 24 to 72 hours, depending on where you live).    However, I would suggest that you seek out someone you can talk to.  Being able to vent and confront what is truly hurting you inside will lead to strength in those private moments when you just want to cut and bleed and forget how f*cked up you feel inside.|`|kjAQj3i7aa	Don't worry about it, nurses and doctors see evidence of self-harm on patients all the time.

6WxsrIusaa	I have had mild-to-moderate acne for over a decade.  It took me a long time and a lot of experimentation to find the right products and the right COMBINATION OF products to keep my acne under control.<br>  <br>  In addition to my usual daily wash and scrub, I also use Desert Essence's "Natural Tea Tree Oil Facial Cleansing Pads".  They're just like Stridex or any other astringent pads, but they use tea tree oil as well as witch hazel and a bunch of other stuff.  I noticed a HUGE improvement in my acne when I started using this product.<br>  <br>  This is something that you would expect to find in a health-food store, and probably not at your local supermarket.  I am getting them for something like 7.49, which gives you 50 pads.  Because they are expensive--and can sting a little and dry out my skin if I use them too much--I limit my use to one pad per day; maybe a second one before bed if I'm tired and lazy.  I won't go more than two in a day because that would really dry me out.<br>  <br>  I can't recommend this product enough.  It's done wonders for my acne, which was not particularly bad, ever, just really, really stubborn.<br>  <br>  I also keep witch hazel and plain cotton pads on hand and will wipe with that if I need to get rid of some oil and don't want to use a spendy tea tree wipe.<br>  <br>  I read somewhere that conditioners can leave pore-clogging residue on your skin, so if you wash your face in the shower, you should do it AFTER you condition your hair (so you can wash away the residue).  I've been doing that for a while and it certainly hasn't made matters any worse.<br>  <br>  P.S. I forgot to mention that I use Queen Helene's Mint Julep Mask, every once in a while, when my pores need a good nuking.  It tends to dry me out somewhat and leave a little bit of a residue, so I don't use it often.  It smells absolutely heavenly though!  It's a kaolin/bentonite-based product.  It's my I-need-to-pamper-myself treatment.|`|SrEbq98maa	hey if u wana get rid of acne and other skin problems <br>  like tanning,blemish,darkspots and tatoo problem ,try<br>  <a href="http://acnecaretipz022.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://acnecaretipz022.notlong.com</a>               <br>  and u ll find tips to get rid of acne,blemishes,dark spots and all your skin problems|`|VDL6herNaa	Tea tree oil is a natural anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory,but its expensive and you won't see the immediate results that you're probably looking for. Try a 10 minute enzyme mask (plant-based, found at any drug store and not-too expensive) to dissolve dead skin cells that clog your pores. It doesn't sound like you have very oily skin, so that should benefit you. Enzyme masks are also great for minimizing acne scars and large pores because the acidity gets rid of the dead skin (much of it that causes bacteria)<br>  Also, try using an apricot scrub (for sensitive skin) to exfoliate. It shouldn't dry out your skin  and it has acne medicine in it. If you want something stronger, then get the full-strength apricot scrub for acne-prone skin. As for proactive, that stuff is way over-priced for what it is. The only working ingredient in it is benzoil peroxide, and you can buy a tube of that stuff for 5 bucks at walgreens (zapzyt or terminator-10 work best, and they blend well and are invisible on your face. Generic benzoil brands like Equate (Walmart) are horrible because they look like clumps of white residue. Just wear the 10% solution while you sleep (this is very strong and effective stuff) and make sure you sleep on white sheets b/c that stuff will bleach fabrics) I understand how the soap you were using stopped working. It happens to me, too. Just switch what products you're using for a while because if you use  the same stuff then it becomes less-effective over time.<br>  Anything with sulfur is good, too. Mint Julep mask (best mask ever) has sulfur in it, but you can't smell it (it smells like yummy mint). It clears up your  skin and tightens your face. I'd even go as far to say that Mint Julep is just as effective as Proactive refining mask. Dab it on your acne before bed and it helps dry it up. Plus, it's only like 3 bucks for a huge tube that will last for months. You can't beat that. That stuff is great. You can also wear a thin layer as a makeup primer if you wear foundation and it stops your face from getting oily. <br>  Another good thing to do is wear a 2.5% (weaker) formula of benzoil cream under your makeup during the day. Just wear makeup over it that has SPF because it will increase<br>  your sensitivity to sunlight (don't go in tanning beds with that stuff on, lol). <br>  Try wearing mineral based makeup or hypo-acneic makeup that won't cause acne (Maybelline makes a great line of mineral-based cosmetics that don't cost a fortune).<br>  Stay away from heavy moisturizers. <br>  Don't overwash your face. That can remove essential oils and your body will produce more, making more acne. <br>  Twice a day, before your morning routine, try using an astringent (Seabreeze brand has a sensitive skin version. Its great b/c it removes all dirt from your pores and it doesn't over-dry skin. It also feels cool and tingly so you know it's working. I'd say this works better than Proactive toner because it has more active ingredients).<br>  Sometimes, acne can also be caused by bacteria on bedsheets. Make sure you change your pillow cases every night. <br>  Don't dry your face with towels, wash-cloths, or facial tissue because these leave fibers and residue in your pores. My dermatologist recommended that I use paper towels or cotton cosmetic pads with toner to clean my face. It helped me.<br>  Drink plenty of water and don't touch your forehead. The oil in your hands will make it worse. And wearing your bangs down will also get oil (from your hair) in your pores. If you hairspray your bangs, that could also attribute to acne because it gets on your forehead. <br>  A lot of my friends from college get forehead acne when they're stressed out over exams, ect. Forehead  acne (and chin acne), is mostly caused by stress. But there are still a lot of things you can do about it. <br>  That's really all I can think of that works for me. It sounds funny, but I drink a lot of green tea and it helps me detox and clears me up. I also take Yaz birth control  and I hardly get acne anymore. Its great for clearing skin. If you use what I mentioned above, its cheaper and better than proactive and everything comes in big tubes so it will last you for months. And before you buy products like this, check out Walgreens.com. You can read user reviews for this stuff before you buy it.<br>  Hope this helps you =)|`|d8dec7383aba64c8eb7690aa6175958faa	Your conditioner may be causing this.. Make sure you wash your face AFTER you wash your hair!<br>  Also, just as a tip, foaming cleansers, whether for your skin or hands, try out your skin tremendously!! I used foaming hand soap for the longest time and my skin would literally crack from being so dry! The reason why i say this is that your skin will produce MORE oil to replace what it has lost, so if you are using an overdrying foam product, your skin is going into overdrive and producing more oil, which could be the cause of your break outs, as well. Good luck!|`|XzdQzO5Waa	I have Neutrogena Grapefruit Scrub and Body Wash.

cvtYbKXXaa	I tried playing the guitar for a short while.  Building up callouses on your fingers takes time and hurts in the process.  There is overstimulation of the nerves during this time and that's why the stinging happens.  Take it slow, or the nerves could be damaged.  Pain and other sensations happens for a reason.  Tells us something is wrong, stop while us cells repair the damage and prepare for the next onslaught!  Please keep playing, but pace yourself.  Just listen to your body's signals.  Rest when there is a problem and resume when it goes away.  More frequent but shorter practice times may be in  order.  Good luck!|`|RuwbtYtAaa	Two things could help you a lot -<br>  <br>  1. Get lighter guitar strings. They vary in gauges - the lighter the guage, the less stressful on your fingers. <br>  2. You might want to get your guitar set up by a guitar geek at your local music store. Among other things, they can adjust the bridge of the guitar so that the strings are closer to the neck, making it easier to fret. They can also change the strings to a lighter gauge for you. <br>  Good luck!|`|lVIg2BLnaa	might sound weird, but alot of guitarists do it, or so im told, i used to. neways, crazy glue the tips of your fingers (not together) on both hands will help. this will feel weird for a bit but you get used to it, make sure you keep your hands free right after doing this cuz i ended up walking around with a guitar pick in my hands for almost a week.
AA11176387	my brother had gerd for years bad enough to hospitalize him    Then I read about a study done in prison where prisoners where given raw (homemade) cabbage juice and compared to a control group..the prisoners given the cabbage juice all got better.    I told my brother and he began taking raw cabbage juice made in a juicer and completely cured his gerd and it has never returned over 10 years.      you could also try this for ulcers    http://www.kingmaker.net/DeadDoctorstxt....

Do not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or antacids.  Drink aloe vera juice to heal the intestinal tract, take papaya tablets to relieve symptoms, eat some fresh pineapple daily to get good enzymes, and eat more raw vegetables to improve your overall digestion.|`|pa7hVLAHaa	The best way is to find what is causing your symptoms...    You should investigate your diet to find the possible culprit food.    Keep a 7 day food diary noting everything you eat and the subsequent symptoms you feel. Once you have collected your data, analyze it to see when your symptoms are the worst. Try to correlate that with what you ate earlier that day.    Next try an elimination diet. Eliminate one of the suspected foods from your diet for 2-3 weeks. If your symptoms improve then you've found the culprit. If not, then try the next suspected food.    FYI: the top food allergies/sensitivities in this order are  -dairy (milk, cheese)  -wheat (gluten)  -eggs  -soy  -nuts (almonds, peanuts)  -corn  -shellfish|`|QkMyhHkaaa	I have the same problem. I use a NATURAL product that can be found at your local Walmart. It is called Hearburn MD, which has been formulated by a doctor. It can be taken everyday. There are 50 gel capsules in a box (the box is an Aqua coloured blue). The only confusing thing is that you take two, which I don't know why they just didn't make them stronger??  Anyhow, the recommended use or purpose on box says; For use as a natural health product for fast-acting and long-lasting relief from occasional heartburn. I have found that it does help me if taken daily.   I will post the website for this product and other products the line carries for other ailments in the source section.   Good Luck.|`|AA11748197	Heartburn is felt as a burning sensation behind the sternum or in the epigastrium. This is probably the result of regurgitation of gastric contents into the esophagus and irritation by the hyperacid contents causing burning sensation behind the sternum. This is associated with water brash and pyrosis.   Acidity cause reflex hyper secretion of alkaline saliva, which collects in the esophagus and is subsequently regurgitated in to the mouth without any effort for vomiting. This is commonly associated with duodenal ulcer.   Some people are more susceptible than others to acidity and heartburn as they have problem in digesting some foods.   Normally the stomach secretes an acid, which is essential for the digestion. This acid helps in the breakdown of the food. When there is excessive secretion of this acid by the stomach it results in heartburn.   Pregnant women suffer from heartburn as the uterus presses on the digestive tract as the fetus grows. Increased acidity with regurgitation causes some amount of oesophagitis (inflammation of the esophagus), which increases the sensitiveness. Acidity causes reflex increased secretion of alkaline saliva, which accumulates in the esophagus and is rushed into the mouth without any sensation of vomiting.    HOME REMEDIES FOR HEARTBURN   Almonds are also a good source for relieving the heartburn and acidity. Eat several almonds when heartburn symptoms persist.    Lemons also help to prevent heartburn. Cut a lemon into thin strips and dip in salt. Eat before meals to prevent heartburn.    Take some mint leaves and chop these and then boil in a cup of water and sip slowly after meals. If a person drinks Fresh mint juice every day he will never experience acidity.     Jaggery or gur taken after every meal also helps to reduce the acidity. Keep a piece of gur in the mouth and slowly suck it till acidity decreases.     Eating bananas is also helpful in preventing the symptoms of acidity and heartburn. To prevent acidity it is advised to eat a banana daily.    A mixture of 2 tsp of natural apple cider vinegar and 2 tsp raw honey in a glass of water before meals fights with acidity.     Basil (occimum sanctum) leaves helps to get relief from burning, nausea and gas. Chew some leaves of tulsi to decrease the acidity.     Coconut water 4-5 times a day decreases the symptoms of the acidity and the heartburn.     Harad (Terminalia chebula) if taken after every meal prevents the symptoms of the acidity.     1 tsp juice of chebulic myroblan mixed with 1 tsp of amla (Indian gooseberry) juice helps to prevent acidity and heartburn.     Boil one cup of water. To this add 1 tsp of Aniseed (Saunf). Cover and leave overnight. Strain the water in the morning, add 1 tsp of honey. When this is taken 3 times a day it prevents acidity.     To 1 ? liters of water add 1 tsp Caraway seeds (shah jeera). Bring to a boil and simmer for 15 minutes. Sip while warm. Take this liquid 2-3 times a day for 5-6 days. It will decrease the acidity.     Take a glass of water, add a pinch of baking soda and drink it. It gives immediate relief from acidity.     Take a glass of warm water, add a pinch of hing (asafoetida) and have it every morning to prevent acidity.     Never smoke before or while eating. Smoking often causes one to swallow small amounts of air, which form air pockets in the digestive tract with the added pressure of food.    Go for a small walk after eating, which will help stimulate the digestive system.     Refrain from consuming alcohol, caffeine, over-the-counter pain relievers, and other stimulants.    Increase more fibre in your diet. This will naturally helps to relieve the future suffering. Bulk foods help to absorb excess acid and gas, and allow your body to rid itself of toxins more quickly.    Drink 8-10 glasses of water.    Put a tablespoon of baking soda into a cup of water and mix it good then drink it.    Keep 10-15 raisins in your mouth. Do not chew. Let them be there. Swallow the saliva secreted. Burning sensation will stop in about 5 minutes.    Eat lots of raw broccoli to kill heartburn.    Mix a little bit of salt and sugar on your hand and eat it.    Take one teaspoon of mustard if you have heartburn or indigestion.    Chewing bubble-gum also disappears the acidity. This is an easy and best way to get rid of Acidity.     For heartburn drink a teaspoon of vinegar. It is because there is not sufficient acid in our stomach to digest food properly, thus gasses come back up and burn our stomach.     Calcium also helps to fight with the heartburn and acidity. Yoghurt or ice-cream gives immediate relief from acidity and heartburn.    After food maintain an upright posture to prevent the reflex and to prevent the symptoms of acidity.     Sleep with your head and shoulder on a high pillow for elevation.     Do not skip meals. Do not keep large gap between meals. This produces gas / wind.     Eat dinner 2-3 hours before going to bed.|`|LmicIEOxaa	Crackers and milk. Aloe juice also works great.
KgSE9QfPaa	I've never really paid much attention to it actually.  Needles don't bother me either.  Even as a kid, it's never bothered me much.  Guess that's a good thing if I'm going to nursing school :p  What is weird to me, though, is that for the first time the other day I had blood drawn and I watched.  Like the part where the needle goes in and everything.  It made me cringe on the inside a little, but I think that mental response to just the sight of it will probably go away if I get used to it.  I figure I'm gonna be poking other people's veins, so I've gotta be able to watch someone do it to me.  And yeah, agreed it does feel weird when they take it out, how it just kind of slides out 'cause it's all wet with blood and... yeah.<br>  <br>  The rubber band is usually used on most patients, I guess to the person above me it might be because you have prominent veins and they feel like they don't need to.  The whole point of it is to increase the pressure by narrowing the vessel and thus making it stick out more.  I guess you *could* ask if it's necessary since I think most of them just make it a habit to put the band on - they'll probably say yes if don't have too much body fat (veins generally get more prominent as you lose weight) or don't have any particular blood condition or too low blood pressure, etc.  Sometimes they need to use it though, so note that if they can't get a good stick the first go around, they may have to stick you multiple times with the needle.... So it may be better just to have the band and only 1 stick :)<br>  <br>  Try drinking a lot of water and eating things rich in sodium before (to temporarily increase your blood pressure).  If you have to fast (some do and some don't) then just trying drinking a whole lot of water to add fluid to your blood vessels so they'll pop out more, then you can ask them.|`|TwVd0etQaa	I have tattoos and piercings all over so when i go to the doctors they laugh when i say im scared of getting blood taken lol Because im now pregnant i HAVE to have it done, personally i would rather not but its something they have to do in order to look after their patients. Just try and think about something else whilst getting it done, thats all you can do|`|7CTvtek0aa	If you get the blood drawn in the AC (bend of your elbow) then someone who is skilled at drawing blood shouldn't even need to use a tourniquet.

AkVT4nbvaa	Because I'm not a doctor I really am not sure but I can tell you that when I took accutane the dermatologist that I saw was EXTREMELY careful about making sure I fulfilled the criteria.  I had to take blood tests each month etc. etc. Also they made me spend about a year trying other things first.  Most doctors will only give you accutane as a last resort.

ObnYA9lxaa	just try masterbating more to relieve stress|`|ehBPus3Zaa	You may have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. This is when you worry or think of something so much that it interferes with some activity you do normally.  I would suggest going to see your school counselor and he/she can help tell your mother you need to see a professional counselor. I'm a mom, but there are definitely some things that my daughter or son does that I REALLY don't want to know. They call it TMI in computer language.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	There is nothing wrong with masturbating, or cussing or making out with boys.  As long as you know your boundaries with a guy and don't pass them, then nothing is wrong.  Masturbating is normal and healthy.  And as to cussing as long as you aren't cussing at people and you watch your mouth around people who don't want to hear it such as your grandparents or teachers then you are in the clear.  <br>  <br>  Just go to bed.|`|B4YESGmwaa	I guess my first question is when you go to mom-is she supportive or condemning? I know a lot of teens do not think it is cool to tell their parents stuff, but if they are supportive they are the best persons to speak to. <br>  If you want to stop telling mom everything I would suggest that you start journaling some of your feelings-NOT just before bed (it will cause more stress) but in the morning or earlier afternoon. After a week or so read back over the journal and decide what behaviors or actions you would feel better not doing. Maybe just make the decision not to make-out for a week and at the end of that time see if you feel any better about yourself. Also you might consider going to a school advisor and ask if there is counseling available in your school God Bless Reggie|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	The obvious solution is for you to stop doing these things that make you feel guilty. HOWEVER, you sound extremely young, because after a couple of years, there will be no guilt about cussing and masterbating, and if your guilty about making out with boys, then your probably not ready to engage in that type of behavior. Furthermore, if your mom is telling you that these things are not good for you or you are prohibited to practice these activities, go with your gut and listen to her|`|RN0zRPH4aa	Well masturbation is something that it's ok to keep a little more private.  But I was the same way with my parents.  Those wrettched little things called conciences ;-)  But I think that that's a good quality to have.  Just remember that as you get older you need to start making smart choices on your own.  Then you won't feel the need to tell your mom.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	yea, you need to just STOP doing things youre ashamed of.|`|Qa1DoqdJaa	You can tell her whatever you want but also you can keep things private. I'm sure there are things (like masturbation) that I'm sure she doesn't even want to know. So you're actually doing her a favor by not telling her. It's good your a truthful person and have a close relationship with your mom but keep some things for yourself. If it doesn't hurt anyone then she doesn't need to know.|`|qMBf2vgiaa	Its not being bad its natural so if you feeling guilty just remember that its natural because it is and you don't need to feel ashamed about it!

And there's nothing really wrong with any of that stuff. Just don't get carried away.|`|doHNEvf8aa	write it down somewhere, that should help get it off your chest and make you feel more relaxed. just hide the journal really good so your mom never finds it|`|DzunYgWOaa	Start a diary|`|5XERNFogaa	Sorry this is really long but I hope you read it and it helps!<br>  <br>  I'm the same way. Exactly. If I do something bad, I want to just run right up to my mom and confess and if I don't, it starts eating away at me.<br>  <br>  Anyway, this is to help YOU. So, all I can say is that there are some things that you are simply allowed to keep private. Everyone has some personal stuff that would just rather not be shared, and that's fine & normal. With the things you listed, I think you'd be more comfortable keeping them to yourself.<br>  <br>  But obviously, you'll still feel bad when you don't tell her. I'd try what some others have said, keeping a journal helps, even if you only do it once or twice. Also, try to find a really good friend you can confess and rant to. Let me tell you, it's nice to have someone your age to talk to about all this crap. Other girls know exactly what you're doing, because they're doing it too. And most will understand where you're coming from and why you need to talk.<br>  <br>  It would also help to cut back on your little "guilty pleasures". I mean, you can still make out with guys, etc. but try to keep it down to a minimum. Nothing excessive. <br>  <br>  And as for your mom, it's great you're really close to her, and I'm sure you can talk to her about a lot of things. Probably more than most girls :) You should be proud your relationship is that good. Maybe you can slip one little wrongdoing to her every once in awhile, nothing that would offend or worry her too much, but just to get at least something off your chest. Like "Oh, I kissed whatshisface yesterday..." and then swap some girly stories... Mom's are sometimes easier to talk to than you think, remember that. <br>  <br>  To sum it all up, you shouldn't be feeling guilty. At least not to the point where you can't sleep at night. Try to get some rest, and remember you aren't a bad person at all for keeping some stuff to yourself. Good luck, and I'm SO sorry that this is freakishly long!|`|vDg3SHdqaa	You need to let it out, building upon this wrongness will get worser and take over, so just spill the beans and the outcome may be bad, but hey the truth sets you free.|`|d23cc319c09ea374ef45255899f4e175aa	first off<br>  stop doing things you know you will regret...<br>  and I have the same issue...<br>  but moms are pretty understanding...<br>  and I once told my mom....and it turned out pretty positive

I know a girl who is 5'8'', 110 pounds and if you just look at her face, she looks like she weighs 180 pounds her face is just so round.  All i can say is that you would have to lose more weight if you want your face to slim down.  There is no such thing as 'target' weight reduction unless you get surgery and im sure you dont want to do that.  But the most important thing is that you are in a healthy weight range before deciding to lose more weight.  Make sure you figure out your BMI, and see where you stand and how much more you can lose and still be healthy.  Hope that helped...good luck wish you the best!|`|pext8whdaa	well to tell you the harsh truth there is no exercise you can slim your face down.<br>  but i know a trick that can do it <br>  make up!!<br>  there is a make-up product from victoria beckham and gives you cheek bones...(cheeks bones will eventally make your face smaller) i heard the product is only in korea but soon will arriving in most countries, if your wondering victoria beckham doesnt really have cheeks bones, its all the make up:)<br>  you can also use bronzer or look on the internet or ask professional for make up tips.<br>  as they say if you dont got it fake it.<br>  i hope i helped you in some ways|`|jHWA2RMzaa	Perhaps loosing a little weight around the arms might help? <br>  <br>  Also, I heard standing up straight can make your face (and entire body) look slimmer, because your neck straightens out, and makes your neck and face look longer. <br>  <br>  But I think you should maybe get lighter highlights around your face. Lighter highlights that frame your face can bring out your cheek bones, make your forehead look smaller, and make your eyes pop out more. Thus all creating a slimmer face look.|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Not really. It has to happen on its own. Usually it will go down with your body. However if it doesn't ...well unfortunately with out surgery you are stuck with it. There may be some toning creams that might work...its always worth a try!! :) Good luck! <br>  Also there are many many people out there with this problem.|`|vFnZhosKaa	The formula for losing weight is simple - consume less food and workout more - the issues arise when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the real world aren't there?! The sole method that clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away twenty five pounds, it clearly does produce results!

Just put some on a Q-tip and hold it on the aching area.<br>  <br>  OTC painkillers help, especially ibuprofen as it is an anti-inflammatory.<br>  <br>  But, like it or not, if you don't go to a dentist it will probably get worse and you may even end up with an abcess which, in my experience, is just about the worst pain you can imagine - worse than childbirth!|`|fkqPs9QRaa	Suck on ice.  And the dentist isnt really that bad.  You mite just have to get a filling.  If you get novacane, the filling isnt bad.  The only thing you feel is a little pinch from the shot.  Also, if you do go to the dentist, make sure you don't eat until you can fully feel everything like your gums and teeth and stuff.

But you most likely have a cavity and it will only get bigger if you don't go see your dentist soon.

MeeJWmGtaa	Duh! Why do you think condoms come in different sizes? Try the Magnum or Magnum XL ones.<br>  <br>  Put it on when you're fully erect, not before.<br>  <br>  And incorporating condoms into sex play might help.|`|c7Gv3N3Raa	I think you would go limp around a condom just from knowing the sensations that you were used to feeling are slightly (some men say horribly) different now. <br>  They are tight so they don't come off..because some people go at it pretty hard and vigorous. Sex=friction=pulling at the condom. <br>  You possibly need a bigger size condom..not necessarily magnum but just a larger size. They make a few different sizes. I think lambskin condoms are supposed to feel better to you but they do not prevent STD's, so you have to be able to trust your partner and no who they've been with and what your risks are. <br>  <br>  I don't think you're allergic to the latex in the condoms or you would get a rash, not just a deflated/limp penis.|`|7iDgUMLraa	u can use the uncircumcised skin as condom..|`|4hNRTWtDaa	They come in sizes, try larger ones.|`|RFuWnx00aa	they have some for bigger sizes.. maybe you need a bigger one?? <br>  and the going limp.. i heard it happens to alot of guys.. i guess it requires thinking to put it on and thinking and sex dont combine??? ask your girl to do it for you, that will probably help :)|`|u4RADVFUaa	hey enjoy man... this pain also good one....enjoy the pain i think u have very big ****.   i wana to seee that.. give the chance.|`|tXmzFIUWaa	pull your skin back then roll it on|`|LDMV3WUTaa	Condoms are "so tight", so they DON'T COME OFF!!! DUH!!!<br>  And I should seriously doubt if being "uncircumcised" has ANYTHING to do with your "problem", dude!!! And if YOU are worried about a "pregnancy scare", there is ALWAYS the "pull out method"!!! Ya know, "pull out" before YOU ejaculate!!! And just in case, ya don't aleady know, condoms are also a VERY GOOD deterrent to the transmission of sexaul diseases!!!<br>  <br>  And as for YOU goin "limp" around condoms, that's probably more of a "mental thing" YOU got goin on there!!! Because if YOU were allergic to them, then YOU would know that for sure!!!

EDXh0tk9aa	It doesn't always work that way.  My hymen was gone before sex and while I never bled, there was still a whole lot of pain. So much so we had to stop and wait to try again another day. <br>  <br>  The vagina is a tubular muscle and until you have sex it's been unused and you will be sore.|`|muHctmaGaa	When my hymen broke, it bled but didn't hurt. A penis will stretch you out, which is the true source of pain.|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	Unfortunatly your friend is not very well educated... but that is completely false. the Hymen will actually rupture over time on its own in many cases without you even know it. what does create uncomfortable first encounters is that you are not MENTALLY and EMOTIONALLY ready to have sex. women are wired VERY differently than men.|`|km6rtHPpaa	Common girly you are to young to even talk about sex.. Needles pop the cherry with or without sex... Wait for few more years .>. then you will fill very very embarrassed and unintelligent to ask this question again...

VB3ZK5f9aa	The feeling of not breathing.  First:  your body will NOT let you not breathe for this.  The worst that would happen is that you would faint, and the body would start breathing automatically.<br>  <br>  What you are feeing is the muscles of the esophagus go into spasm.  It feels awful - it is a strong spasm, and the body doesn't react well to internal spasms (unlike, say, a calf muscle).  Your glands are not actually swelling up.  The body tries to hold still - even to the point of moving the diaphram very little.  That is what is affecting your breathing.  (The esophagus passes through the diaphram.  They are not actually connected, but what happens to one affects the other.)<br>  <br>  Try to look forward to the endoscopy - no sense worrying now about questions that ARE going to be answered.  There are very effective medicines and treatments for GERD and hiatal hernias.  (GERD = Gastric Esophageal Reflux Disease)<br>  <br>  When the episode hits, try to keep in mind that the spasm will pass, and your body will not let you actually stop breathing.  Sorry it feels so bad at the time.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Your worrying too much. Yes, acid reflux disease is a serious disease that can lead to cancer of the throat and quit possibly death, but thats far down the road. <br>  <br>  If you've been diagnosed you should be on pills now. Helps with the disease. Just take your meds and you should be fine.
muHctmaGaa	Wearing a bra won't alter your genetics. Try exercising to build up your pectoral muscles, which will give your breasts a subtle life. Get professionally fitted for a bra so you undergarments don't make you look saggier.|`|OCCgg3A4aa	Just wear a push-up bra, but I don't think it will permanently make them that way.|`|3TyrAZwMaa	if your worried about saggy breasts wear a push up bra. they will be much higher up.<br>  <br>  but a bra doesn't effect if your breasts sag or not. a bra just "holds" them.|`|AA12371168	no..wish that were all it took.
UgtEjHmcaa	Totally normal. I'm a chick, and I think about sex 24/7!|`|GQJbOblQaa	Masturbating is normal but doing it daily and thinking about it always, is not normal.  At 13, you are an adolescent and you can spend more time in playing, reading story books, listening to music, making friends and talking to them etc.  To always think about sex and masturbate can make you weak, if indulged daily.  Develop some hobbies and spend time in doing other things than masturbating.  In course of time, you will overcome the problem.|`|wJ0OlkLKaa	Well you are only 13 and trust me it is pretty normal so nomal that anyone going through puberty like you...gets busy doing it. I bet majority of your classmates have done it too, or they are probably doing it right now who knows right. Maybe you think is wrong because it's something new, you are getting to know your body, your exploring what your body really likes and what it's like to have sex (only that I guess that for now is only with your hand lol). Just enjoy your life and be safe. And sometimes when in doubt the best people to ask are your parents.|`|tqC2LCkoaa	hey well i am a girl and im 15 but yes it is normal your hormones are changing and you are developing more testostrone (the male sex hormone) well in english[there is a chemical going through your body making you horny] i have done the same thing i have wondered also and yes it is normal.|`|8781c2b8fec56cba142d67f5750bb0b9aa	Hahaha.

Look up cookbooks in the area you want. Low cal, cooking for 1, etc. Steer away from carbs. You can have some for breakfast but eat it with protein. Bagels are THE WORST. Instead of snacking on chips or cookies (the easy way), eat fruit or veggie sticks. Salads are fine but the majority have more calories than a Big Mac because of the dressing. Again, there are some great books on eating that can help guide you to eat right. Eat throughout the day.

LSOdPWkYaa	Yes this is a very difficult situation your brother has gotten himself into.  He thinks he has figured out a way to deal with his life, by numbing it and not facing the his real issues, and not wanting to actually feel his pain, and go through the pain.  I use to be a pot smoker for about fifteen years,  it absolutely almost destroyed my life because I never wanted to face what was really going on with me.  Fortunately I never turned to anything else, meaning other drugs.  I will tell you what happen to me,  I asked Jesus to take it from me,  and been drug free ever since.  I have a brother and sister who are completely still addicted to pot smoking, they have been smoking for years as well and I have had conversation with them about quitting, but will not happen until they truly want to and the only thing I can do is PRAY.  GET ON MY KNEES AND PRAY FOR MY SIBLINGS AND THAT GOD INTERVENE AND TAKE CARE OF IT.  So you ask what do you do?

SltEwVX7aa	at your age, you're growing, and growin fast.  The body needs a lot of calories to grow.  You just simply need to eat more.  <br>  <br>  If you're in school, then your day probably goes like:  breakfast, lunch (anywhere from late morning to early afternoon), after school snack, dinner, evening snack.  I know how teenagers can eat!<br>  <br>  It's important to get a little of everything, with an emphasis on calcium (milk, cheese), protein (milk, meat and fish, some beans), and vegetables (all of them.  yes, even broccoli).  Your body needs the variety and vitamins that come from these things.  You also need some fruit (maybe part of breakfast, afterschool snack, and evening snack), and yes, even some (very little, but some) junk food (Twinky, chips, ice cream, pie).  While carbs have been getting a bum rap lately, at your age, that will be the one thing to help you gain weight.  Have a second helping of potatoes.  Eat all the rice you want.  Pasta.  This stuff stays with you, and helps you get through until the next session of food inhalation.|`|DrXWucWpaa	-Youre not eating enough<br>  -Youre growing<br>  -You nay be eating "empty" foods<br>  <br>  Its okay to eat, if you are hungry then go get some food, but do not mistake it for bordom or thirst.  Junk food is okay here and there but always try to eat healthy:  snack on veggies & dip instead of candy, chips ect.  If you are a soda drinker you can always cut that out for diet pop, or other low/no calorie drinks.  You most likely will not get "fat".

If you have occasional extra beats but you are an otherwise healthy person, there's generally no reason for concern and no treatment needed.<br>  <br>  You've likely heard to drink in moderation, but what does that mean? And why is moderation important? Moderate alcohol use seems to offer some health benefits, particularly for the heart.

A drink is defined as 12 ounces (355 milliliters) of beer, 5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine or 1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of 80-proof distilled spirits. <br>  Moderate alcohol consumption may provide some health benefits. It may: Reduce your risk of developing heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and intermittent claudicating. Reduce your risk of dying of a heart attack. Possibly reduce your risk of strokes, particularly ischemic strokes. Lower your risk of gallstones. Possibly reduce your risk of diabetes.<br>  <br>   Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, including: <br>  Cancer of the pancreas, mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, and liver, as well as breast cancer.

VCIZJQCJaa	yup there is such a doctor-pharmacy -government site. that's why you sign for a prescription(you don't see )and it's national and that's how you got caught,doctor shopping each doctor has a different version of this document,and they will give you a copy if asked for,they don't have to though,and they can use it against you in court,or to cut you off narcotics.it's mainly to protect them not you. why did you use 2 pharmacies-that's your error-can't do that anymore.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Most likely the one doctor is upset because they can get in trouble for dispensing pain meds to you when you are already getting them.

The reason you should disclose the other meds you take is so that the doctor can look for medications that work together & won't cause an adverse effect - such as death. <br>  <br>  Given that there have been a lot of changes in the way our personal medical records are being archived these days, there are probably a number of ways your physician's office was able to obtain the information regarding the additional prescribed drugs. You mention a PCP, are you on an HMO? If so, all of your medical care is routed through the PCP, and those doctors normally will work together to achieve a desired outcome for your case.<br>  <br>  If I were a doctor, and you were my patient, I would hope that you would have been honest with me regarding the medications you were taking. The fact that you are utilizing different doctors and pharmacies to obtain and fill these prescriptions might suggest a little something more is going on.|`|c55O7jqXaa	People who abuse drugs often use several pharmacies and yes they have every right to check it out if the suspect anything odd. I went to switch my Husband's meds to another pharmacy and because I was still on file with the other they wouldn't fill them until his doctor got it straightened out. <br>  <br>  They have to cover their butts too. For all they know you could be going to another doctor and getting some drugs and then to them getting drugs and if they don't know what you are taking from another doctor they could prescribe you something that interacts with the others that you are taking and cause you to become ill or even death. Can you say lawsuit!!<br>  <br>  So don't get upset or them thinking you are so drug addict. This is just the law and rules they follow and good ones at that. <br>  <br>  I always tell my doctor everything I am taking whether it be on ocassion, natural meds, and even over the counter just in case. I don't want any problems.

Go ahead!|`|PQ21qz9Xaa	Yeah, but I would wait until you start your next pack of pills. If you start taking them later than your body is used to you might put yourself at risk of pregnancy. Finish this pack, have your withdrawal period and then start taking them at the new time.|`|AA10726910	you can take it when ever you want. I have been taking birth control for over 4 years and i take it when i want to it douse not matter as long as you take it ever day..|`|gULNGNkFaa	Sure. The most important part is to take it as consistently as possible in terms of that being daily (if you have that variety) and about the same time each day.|`|D6PxGv4Caa	yea.<br>  its jus good to make sure yu take it around the same time everyday<br>  im jus not sure wut it will do with the sudden change in schedule
8yE2sYGeaa	The reason it is boring it not the technique, but the approach.<br>  <br>  Rather than looking at the porn, you need to make up stories in your head, using the porn as a jumping off point.<br>  <br>  You might want to look at lubrication as well|`|grPckwSsaa	spell check!|`|SZdVYrSSaa	Lubrication is always a help.<br>  <br>  Try building it up a bit, watch porn with your eyes closed, visualizing a scenario and using only the sounds, try rubbing it a little but don't take it out of your pants until you can't stand waiting any longer.<br>  <br>  You could also experiment with a close friend if things are no fun anymore but you aren't ready to date, or try relocating somewhere a little more risky.

6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	This is pretty normal. You can get pimples at any time. I also rarely had pimples in my teenage years but I have found that since I came to college I have had more outbreaks. You usually stop growing in your late teens early 20s so I doubt you will get taller. Plus 5'7" is a relatively average height
muHctmaGaa	Ovulation can be irregular, especially in younger girls. This is why methods like Natural Family Planning don't work even when charting menstrual cycles and cervical mucus. <br>  <br>  She's ALWAYS likely to get pregnant. It's a moot point.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If she knows when her period is due for sure then right before her period is the safest time.  No lectures.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|xU9Qhczqaa	Have your girl track her period and have sex 2 weeks before shes supposed to get it|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Yeah ok.  You're a guy asking this?  You're asking for some fun comments on that one!  Are those my only options?  I would say in the middle when it's the bloodiest.  But there are a few days before and a few days after that are ok... but beware of the few days after.. they often are miscalculated and that's how it happens!|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Probably right before or during.  Usually ovulation occurs about 2 weeks later.  Every woman is different though, as is every cycle.  The "rhythm method" is NOT a good form of birth control!|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	Right before her period.|`|jHmF9Ak1aa	Right after is safest however not 100%. The middle, of the menstrual cycle, is the ovulation time. Two weeks before her period starts is usually when ovulation begins. Right before could be okay but her body hasn't gotten rid of the egg yet (that is what the period is for). Most likely it isn't able to be fertilized by this point but it is there.|`|Q2dJhKJraa	Honestly, there really is no time when your least likely to get pregnat. <br>  YOu can get pregnant any time of the month, i have known friends that have gotten pregant during their period. Especially if your young, you are fertile every single day of the month!<br>  So i would suggest some Birth control. Try Planned Parenhood, its free there...|`|XQvLV5imaa	Either right BEFORE your period, or right AFTER your period. Ovulation takes place about 2 weeks after your period.<br>  <br>  Oh wait... HER period... my bad.  =)|`|rhuhp6KCaa	Right after her period is the best time.  anywhere from 1-14 days are good. if i were you i would keep it at 1-8  after her period just to be safe!         Good luck.|`|1gnNDagMaa	dont rely on her cycle u dont know it and sperm can always be left over thats number. so birthcontrol is ur other option.
rhuhp6KCaa	you have to keep taking it whether you get your period or not. the only time you should stop is if you miss 2 period and even then you should ask your doctor first. Im on birth control for over a year now so i know what im talking about.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Sometimes with bc pills, you will skip a period, so just take a pill every day or it will not remain effective.  Keep taking it.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|MA8AUiQYaa	i would!
3AVHxNNTaa	you have a giant, fat head.|`|TPTpwarwaa	Definately emphasize on cardio, especially Running. You will tone your body great and keep it that way with running 4-5 times a week for 30 minutes to 45 minutes. If you can't run all that right away, just add bursts-keep putting up the time on those each week too. Running up hill is definately the best for you!<br>  And also stregnth training, 2 times a week. I use shape.com on their bikini countdown, it's great they have the videos and everything-these exercises really work! I also use a home dvd: Hit The Spot Pilates with Denise Austin, i got it at walmart for like $10 and it really works you yet is quite easy. <br>  Also on shape.com they have a 10 pound meltdown, if you're ever interested in losing some weight look at that-they have great routines to follow.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	i think you HAVE to be taller than 5'8, because for me at 140 and the same height, already get the muffin... i have to keep myself at 125 to look my best (and do!) besides, you HAVE to be hallucinating... there is NO WAY that you weigh THAT MUCH and fit into size 2. especially with only C chest. maybe DD? but no, 150 and size 2 at our height would make you a freak.|`|a1PLvvdJaa	if u want abs go to youtube and put in 7 minute abs  it is the fisrt one it is great i use it

Humans are all self interested.|`|r8qbCKgfaa	I don't believe in God, or religion at all. I think it is a farse, and if I had my way I'd ban it.<br>  <br>  That being said, people feel they are "owed" because the world is sympathetic to everyone's problems.<br>  <br>  You run out of work, the government gives you welfare so you don't have to sell **** off.<br>  <br>  You can't afford your medicine, the government gives it to you on medicade.<br>  <br>  You have a kid and get divorced, the other person OWES you and has to pay you to raise the kid, even though you are not obligated to use that money to benefit the child.<br>  <br>  You do not want to be this way sir, it is ignorant. Have some self respect, and work for what you have. If someone offers you for something, take it, but don't go looking for handouts expecting everyone else to cover your ***.
c55O7jqXaa	You are thin, but the fact that you have the weight and untoned middle says that you are out of shape. You can be underweight and be out of shape. <br>  <br>  I do suggest getting some exercise. You don't have to go overboard, but doing some walking would do you good along with some tummy crunches to tone up that area and make you feel better about yourself. Don't focus on the weight, but rather how you are feeling. <br>  <br>  Eating more healthy- veggies, fruits, lean meats, whoel grains, lowfat milk, and water, water, and more water is the best thing for you. <br>  <br>  I am 5'4 and lucky to be 100-105 soaking wet and I right now could stand to lose some of the flab around the middle, but I am also turning 40 this year. I was doing Martial Ats for many years and in the best shape of my life and weighed about 95-100 pounds, but even though I was very thin I was feeling good and ate well and just generally in good shape. <br>  <br>  I suggest not going down the road on counting calories, but rather everything in moderation and getting that heartrate up whether you want to our not.|`|PgPW8nfKaa	maybe you could try and do something like kickboxing? i know you said you're too lazy for like cardio and stuff, but kickboxing is soooo much fun, im 15 and i used to do it at least four days a week, but ive stopped just recently due to like health issues and being busy with school, family, boyfriend and stuff. lol. and like i don't know what your like every day diet is, but if you eat lots of healthy foods and then snack on healthy things like some raw veggies and hummus, or some fruit or dried fruits and nuts [almonds are the healthiest], that may help.|`|0ZR6T0cCaa	have u heard about liposuction???|`|R1ftDQtsaa	you should still try to work out even if it isnt how intense as it used to be.<br>  <br>  it should help to keep the weight off
tIldpr7vaa	kinda 2 different goals<br>  <br>  to build muscle: eat lots of good protein rich foods and focus on working out with heavy weights<br>  <br>  lose weight:<br>  limit calories and carbs, no sugars and focus more on cardio|`|Z81bOxq7aa	Probably best to just cut out ALL junk & fast food & pop (soda in the states) that alone will make a BIG & I mean BIG difference. Drink more water than you ever have before & that will help flush the digestive system. If you don't go to the bathroom regularly try putting ground (not whole) Flax Seed on salads it will kick start the digestive process also give you the needed omega3's. Then when you are lifting weights alternate between more reps & higher amounts of weight. You will get long, bigger, stronger muscles. Doesn't your football coach help with that info for you????????? Your school nurse should have material on healthy eating available for you as well.<br>  JTM&AB|`|5JR6qwXtaa	Well for football losing weight usually isn't an issue. You want to buff up you just need to join the weight lifting class at your school. Unless you just want to lose weight, start running and work your core a lot. Cutting junk food is good too. Drink lots of water and be consistent.|`|fOS41FAfaa	Either work out harder, or just stay on your current workout plan and see how it works out. Be sure to eat lots of protein if you plan on building muscle mass. Protein shakes/bars, cottage cheese, nuts, beef, poultry. I'm sure you can figure out what else has protein in it. Try using a search engine to search for "weight training tips" or something similar.<br>  <br>  Since you play football, you'll want to consume plenty of calcium. Be sure to get plenty of sunlight, which produces vitamin which helps your body absorb the calcium.|`|EuKGCrzkaa	well, im not too sure what body type you are (skinny or hefty), so i'll give you general advice. SPEED SPEED SPEED! Coaches will always consider players who are fast and agile. So you should work on your speed and reaction time. that means run very fast for short distances.  As for strength, you will be focusing a lot on your chest, as that is what you are going to be pushing with. try bench press and lots of pushups, if possible. you also should do squats. squats will help you push better.
tIldpr7vaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!<br>  <br>  that's for very obese people, not people who lose a couple vanity pounds<br>  <br>  besides no doctor in his right mind would give a150lb person that surgery<br>  <br>  Diet and cardio that's all u need, try harder to exercise and get a better diet. limit calories and carbs and avoid all sugars.<br>  <br>  jeez, the ignorant teens on here are unbelievable|`|c55O7jqXaa	No doctor is going to do that unless you are super obese. I suggest getting in to see a nutrtionist that can help you set up a program that will help you or get you into a group so you have others to be accountable to. <br>  <br>  It may just be genetics and for some people it is harder to lose the weight, but you have to stick to the lifestyle chage. <br>  <br>  Drink only water, get out and walk. Gee even if you don't have the time walk while you are in the shower. You walk in place or dance around will burn off calories. There is no excuse for not getting some exercise even for the busiest people or even those that are disabled. You can get exercise even if you are wheelchair bound so I don't want to hear any excuses other than you need to stick with something and not give up so easily. <br>  <br>  You will notice inches coming of first rather than the weight as you build muscle you may not see any weight lose, but you can tell because your pants fit looser. <br>  <br>  eat veggies, lean meats, whole grains, cereal, fresh fruits and frozen fruits and everything in moderation. <br>  <br>  You don't have to give up everything.<br>  <br>  Eat a good breakfast in the morning. People who eat breakfast and usually thin because they eat less in the day. This is the most important meal of the day, eat lunch and then fruit for snacks and try to eat supper early and keep it light fair.|`|4onT0qUxaa	Sorry, sweetie, but you do not qualify for any type of weight loss surgery. First off, you have to be at least 18 and second, you have to be at least 100 pounds overweight (approximate BMI of 40 or more) to qualify. Otherwise they will not even consider this as an option for you. You'll have to do it the old-fashioned way! Besides, weight loss surgery is a very drastic step, I know, I had it! You have to give up sugar, alcohol, high-carb and high-fat foods, and you have to commit to taking VERY good care of yourself and take a handful of vitamins every day as well as keep track of your protein intake and having regular blood tests. It is a rather major lifestyle change, not just another diet!|`|0pXBYo4paa	No, gastric bypass is reserved for severely obese people. The doctors would refuse to do it. What you have can be dealt with on your own. You need to exercise. Start jogging 30 minutes 4 - 6 times a week and cut out all the cheese, grease, fat and junk food food. You will be in shape by summer.<br>  <br>  There is no reason for most people to be fat, it's just a matter of changing bad habits.|`|5lsQlfqXaa	no!<br>  <br>  here's an answer i gave to a similar weight-loss question; it might help you:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The truth is, the best, healthiest way to lose weight is to get sufficient exercise and eat reasonably healthy. You've probably heard of the lemon detox diet - things like that don't work; the weight will only end up coming back on. It's the same with not eating (not eating makes your body go into starvation mode, making it harder to burn fat) [trust me, i've been there].<br>  <br>  Try to cut down on junk food a little at a time. Maybe try to find alternatives to unhealthy foods you like, i.e. instead of eating icecream try frozen yoghurt. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water; i'd heard that thirst can often be mistaken for hunger.<br>  Another thing you could do is , if you feel like eating something unhealthy, have a piece of fruit first. If you're still hungry then eat the other food, but be sure not to have too much. Portion size is important.<br>  <br>  How much exercise do you do each day? It's recommended that people do 20 - 30 minutes each day. Even just (for example) a walk around your suburb will help.<br>  <br>  If you follow these suggestions you should notice a difference. It will probably be two or so weeks until you notice the change. Don't give up on it, and do consider getting an adult to help you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps (:

qdZxscaNaa	Hi<br>  <br>  The changes might not show up on the first couple of xrays.  But one thing that will happen is that they will make regular appointments for your son to be seen and most likely, they will xray his hips each time.  Over time they will develop a profile of what his hip was like and then even the subtle changes will become more evident, as they compare xrays with earlier ones.  Some doctors do MRI's and a lot of them don't - depends on what resources are available to your specialist, what he has had experience with and is comfortable with.  This will also affect the sort of treatment you will be offered.<br>  <br>  Your son is into the older age range (just) for diagnosis, and so will possibly need more aggressive treatment, if it is in fact perthes.  This means that 'wait and see' won't be a viable option for him, if there are issues with containment of his femoral heads.  <br>  <br>  I set up a website with a heap of information about the latest treatments and therapies available for perthes, also what it is and what its doing and a good list of FAQ's and medical glossary, so that everyone can make informed decisions for their childs treatment - link below.<br>  <br>  You will also find an email address on there and if you contact me through that, I can put you in touch with an online support group, so that you can bounce ideas off other perthes parents and get information on how to deal with this on a day-to-day basis, which can be invaluable, as they all either have a child with perthes, or had it themselves as children.<br>  <br>  All the best<br>  <br>  Donna|`|NRQm8d0Vaa	An x-ray of the hips will often pick up changes in the femoral head that signify Perthes disease. Sometimes the changes are too subtle to see on x-ray. In these cases, MRI and bone scan are able to pick up these changes and lead to the diagnosis.
c55O7jqXaa	You are in the normal weight range so stop fretting. <br>  <br>  It is good that you are working out. Boxing gets that heartrate up and also is good for building muscle. Remember too that muscle weighs more than fat. <br>  <br>  I would rather see a higher number on the scales and have muscle then to have fat.|`|9KKhcJJlaa	No, the only thing you need to worry about is your grammar.|`|ZJVNUmz3aa	no, you're fine...just don't eat a bunch of crap if you're worried, but you are definitely in a good weight range.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	u r fine, perfect in fact|`|1gYxAv09aa	It may just be your bone size or muscle that causes the weight. No offense but you are fairly short. A person with big bones should weight more since their bones are well bigger if that's your body type. You also may have more muscle then what you see it just hasn't been toned yet and that is what may be adding the weight. There's also the fact that you are only thirteen. Sure in puberty girls tend to gain fat but the beauty behind it is that most girls grow into it, and if you stay in boxing there is no doubt that you will grow into looking and being in good physical shape.|`|IJrsH2tGaa	No, I would say that you are a perfect weight for your height.

13k2WKx8aa	Brandon is wrong. Green gas is not CO2. There is no CO2 in it. It's based off of hydrocarbons. I'm pretty sure that you can't get high off of CO2 either. If you could, Pepsi and Coke sales would skyrocket. CO2 actually kind of burns your nose if you take a whiff of it. Ever burp and feel it in your sinuses? That's CO2.<br>  <br>  You could use it as a fuel source. It will work in refillable lighters, although it requires one that can take higher pressures than those of butane.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you could huff it, but I don't imagine anything would even come of it.<br>  <br>  It contains absolutely no CFC's. They use replacement hydrocarbon gasses. I'm confident you really can't get high off of butane or propane. In an ironic twist though, "Green" gas, rather than depleting the ozone layer, is 25 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than CO2.|`|KC5vBg4uaa	Just tell your dad if you really wanted to get high, you'd do marijuana.|`|fMfBAgOUaa	Yes you can, and you can also die (very easily) from it. The gas in the canisters for airsoft/paintball guns is Co2, so if you inhale it, you are literally inhaling poison.

I was very scared before hand too, I even cried a little, but it was no big deal at all.  Dont worry its not worth your time to worry about it.

VRsFXHvPaa	I started having anxiety attacks at 18 all of a sudden. I used to be VERY carefree. Same thing: gym, job, college. Very strange. <br>  <br>  I went to the doctor for years, they told me it's in my head, it's in my head, but these anxiety attacks would come out of no where. Like you said, it also came with depression. After years they foud out I was Bi-Polar. You don't know until you are in your 20s because it emerges at that age. When you are young, some Bi-Polar sufferers are diagnosed with ADD instead, but later are found to not have ADD but Bi-Polar<br>  <br>  Do you think this could possibly be it? It helped me. Now I just take deep breaths and try not to eat too much (lol being full gives me anxiety attacks for some odd reason)<br>  <br>  The only physical symptoms are numb face, feet and hands (all the nerve endings). This comes with anxiety. Also extreme shaking, feeling cold / hot, feeling like there are needles poking you, heart palpitations.. etc..<br>  <br>  What helped me is to never make plans because I don't know what the future holds. I don't know if this will do the opposite for you, though >.< I don't like to think of the future too much, and it helps for me to not make any plans. I lost nearly all my friends, too. They all know now of my anxiety problem and are very supportive. <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctor and try to get him to prescribe you Valium, Ativan, or Xanax. You must be mentally stable, though, they don't want you to overdose! These are temporary medications, and they will provide you a long term medication. I'm just trying to wait it out. It's been 2 years now and I have finally been able to stop taking Ativan in the morning and Valium at night without getting an Anxiety attack.<br>  <br>  If you are a vegitarian, do NOT eat only beans! This WILL cause a panic attack. Random knowledge hah. Eating too much of one thing, chemical imbalance etc will cause it. However you said you do not have any imbalances, like I didn't :( There is a special very detailed test that they could do to see all your protein levels etc to see if you have a balance but I don't know too much about that..<br>  <br>  Everyone is different I guess. Talk to your doctor about it, hopefully he/she can help!!|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Yes, it is depression, and you sound like you are having anxiety attacks. Both of these can be treated at the same time. Depression can be caused by many things. One being a chemical imbalance that messes up the neurotransmitters in your brain.  You can have chronic fatigue, heart palpitations, chronic pain syndrome, and lots of other things.|`|3SqtWtaxaa	Yes it sounds like depression as well as anxiety. Most anxiety disordors are accompanied with depression.|`|iJ2A7sr5aa	I totally feel the same way dude......I used to be a happy guy who likes hanging out, driving the free road, going out for parties but everything changed just recently..I don't have the energy to live another day..I lost contact with friends..I feel totally filthy like everyone thinks I'm always thinking about sex..........and I want answers too.......if theres anybody out there who feels totally the same as I do...I'd love to talk about it and learn more rather than just sit around hiding like there's nothing else to do.........huh

hQIqEnTEaa	Group B streptococci (or GBS for short) is a form of bacteria that colonises the vagina and can cause problems during pregnancy (eg urine infections, wound infections) or at the time of delivery where the baby is exposed to the bacteria as it passes through the birth canal.<br>  <br>  It is routinely tested for during pregnancy and if a woman tests positive she will receive antibiotics during labour. This is necessary to reduce the baby's chance of developing a severe infection (eg meningitis, pneumonia) after being exposed.<br>  <br>  A significant proportion of women test positive for GBS and get treated during labour. Don't be concerned, your daughter's doctors have it well under control.|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Bacillus streptococcus is a very very common bacteria, most of us have it but it doesn't cause a problem unless you get a cut or your immune system is down for some reason.

The bacteria does not cause disease in the carriers, but if a baby is delivered vaginally to a GBS positive mom, there is a risk that this bacteria can infect the newborn.  Neonatal GBS infections can be life-threatening, resulting in pneumonia, meningitis, etc.  For this reason it is common practice to screen pregnant women for this bacteria.  Women who carry GBS and plan on a vaginal delivery are given antibiotics prior to delivery to reduce the number of GBS in the vaginal mucosa, and lower the risk of transmission to the newborn.|`|0nyWiro9aa	FAQ from the CDC site is a good starting point.

I had been using Implanon (which is really good although I was having a fair bit of bleeding after a couple of years), then went back to the pill which made me insanely depressed so I'm now trying Mirena.  It was pretty much my last option!  My doctor was all for it (I've been on many different pills but due to period pain that wasn't alleviated by being on different types of the pill I tried Implanon, and now Mirena) because he believes I will eventually not bleed at all.  It's been a bit of trial and error, but I'm happy so far!

464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	In many cases you can first use the PRINCE approach to treat your ankle:<br>  <br>      * Protection. Use a protective brace, such a brace with a built-in air cushion or another form of ankle support.<br>      * Rest. Use crutches until you can walk without pain.<br>      * Ice. For at least the first 24 to 72 hours or until the swelling goes down, apply an ice pack for 10 to 20 minutes every hour or two during the day.<br>      * NSAIDs or acetaminophen. NSAIDs (such as Advil and Motrin) are medicines that reduce swelling and pain. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) reduces pain.<br>      * Compression. An elastic compression wrap, such as an ACE bandage, will help reduce swelling. You wear it for the first 24 to 36 hours. Compression wraps do not offer protection. So you also need a brace to protect your ankle if you try to put weight on it.<br>      * Elevation. Raise your ankle above the level of your heart for 2 to 3 hours a day if possible. This helps to reduce swelling and bruising.<br>  <br>  Proper treatment and rehabilitation exercises are very important for ankle sprains. If an ankle sprain does not heal right, the joint may become unstable and may develop chronic pain. This can make your ankle weak and more likely to be reinjured. Before you return to sports and other activities that put stress on your ankle, it's a good idea to wait until you can hop on your ankle with no pain. Taping your ankle or wearing a brace during exercise can help protect your ankle. Wearing hiking boots or other high-top, lace-up shoes for support may also help. But use caution. Don't force your foot into a boot if you feel a lot of pain or discomfort.<br>  <br>  If your ankle is still unstable after rehab, or if the ligament damage is severe, your doctor may recommend surgery to repair the torn ligaments.<br>  What kind of rehabilitation program should you follow?<br>  <br>  Rehab exercises can begin soon after the injury. You can try to walk or put weight on your foot while using crutches if it doesn't hurt too much. Depending on your pain, you can also begin range-of-motion exercises while you have ice on your ankle. These exercises are easy to do-you just trace the alphabet with your toe. This helps the ankle move in all directions.<br>  <br>  Ask your doctor about other rehab. Stretching, strength training, and balance exercises may help the ankle heal totally and may prevent further injury. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ankle-sprain-overview" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ankle...</a>|`|eEwG0EeJaa	If it still hurts when you land, why are you still playing basketball? If you want the swelling to go down, stay off it for a couple weeks. It's still swollen because it's bruised, and you running, and jumping on it isn't going to help it heel faster. Stay off it for a few days, and see how it feels.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	You need to allow yourself time to let it heal. You're straining it too much.

Shouldn't be much longer.|`|gORVTI9saa	You have to just rest well. I've sprained my ankle quite a few times as well, and the last time i sprained it, the swell only completely went off after about 3 and a half weeks. You might want to try using a cold compress.

This isn't that hard, especially with exercise. 500 calories worth of diet restrictions (just eat something healthy instead of one of your regular meals, for example a 500 calorie salad instead of a1000 calorie sandwich and fries for lunch) plus 500 calories worth of exercise (half an hour of moderate-intense cardio, 45 minutes of moderate cardio) can give you that.

ojOs8GLeaa	About 3,500 calories adds up to about 1 pound. This applies whether the calories are food calories coming in, or calories (burned by exercise or just breathing) going out.<br>  If you eat 3,500 calories more than your body needs, you will put on about 1 pound. If you use up 3,500 calories more than you eat, you will lose about 1 pound in weight.<br>  Your exercises will improve the muscle tone on the muscles you exercise, (cardiovascular and legs). Feel your leg muscles and if you want similar results on your stomach, add exercises for those muscle groups. You are dieting at the same time, so you will reduce your overall fat level. Five pounds is 17,500 calories. A Big MAC meal is 1350 calories or a 9.5 mile (15.2km) walk. <br>  Five pounds is 13 Big MAC meals. However, junk food is often loaded with salt which causes you to retain water until your body can get rid of the salt. Two litres or two US quarts of water weigh about 5 pounds. <br>  Remember how slowly you gained the weight, say 5-8 lbs per year for 5-7 years and be patient and persistent. <br>  However, if you want a true miracle weight loss cure go here: <a href="http://www.wemarket4u.net/fatfoe/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wemarket4u.net/fatfoe/</a><br>  Keep up the good work!|`|ISyATX98aa	1 Put down the processed food and anything you eat that you dont cook.

HeMYzftiaa	Sounds like your plan is helping you lose a whole lot of calories! It really is effective at losing weight (calories) at a good pace. Considering your exercise, you don't even have to change your diet to lose weight. However, if you want to join the Royal Marines, as well as maximize your weight loss, consider also adding weight training into your routine. At least 45-60 minutes 3 times a week, and possibly more as you progress. The more you weigh, the more more fat you burn naturally, even at rest, and lean muscle burns more calories than fat or any other tissue. Therefore, the more muscle you have, the more fat you burn naturally, at rest, in your sleep, and while exercising. So if you want to maximize fat loss, add the weight training to build muscle to your routine instead of just doing more cardio (running and rowing, while rowing does to a bit of muscle training) at the gym. You'll be looking great in no time! By the way, to those who are confused, a stone is 14 pounds, 6.35 kg.|`|nARTpAnDaa	Sounds like your on the right track to lose the weight, have you asked the instructors in the gym, they could proberbly help you finding your answer.<br>  Im sure you'll see results in no time but remember muscle weighs more than fat so it would be better to take you're measurements, you'll see the inches disappear.<br>  Good luck with the training, i know alot of Royal Marines and i know what training they go through to get there green beret and you have to be very fit, so keep going and im sure you'll ge there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|8umPjHVeaa	Aah!

However since you cant cook it atm and the marijuana needs to steep in water for 8 hours, dried on paper towels steeped in butter then strained in cheesecloth and smells all the while the best option you have is Leary biscuits which are cracker, cheese, and ground up bud. (As much as you can want/have/can tolerate, hey its not supposed to taste good and remember you wont feel it for a few so use as little as possible at first) You can top it w/ more cheese and another cracker if you wish then just pop it in the microwave. It wont really smell. You can just eat as is but heating in the microwave makes the THC more potent. <br>  Remember weed is more soluble in alcohol, fats, or oils (such as the fat in butter, cheese and whole milk) so if you add it to any of these the body will absorb more THC.<br>  PB Sandwhich and weed also works in a pinch :p|`|vtm3dCaVaa	You can not eat the plant buddy be careful cause it will make your stomach sick.. you put the pot in a small container with cooking oil in the oven. then with the oil you get after it has been in the oven you make the brownies. careful dude. I saw a friend eat one brownie and he did not feel anything right away. <br>  <br>  so he ate like four brownies. he was telling everybody nothing happened but after 40 minutes he was asleep as a log. <br>  <br>  so watch it it hits you hard but it takes longer for some people to get stoned this way.|`|WX7pUlepaa	idk.<br>  <br>  but i have eaten bud before and it didnt hurt me, although it did ruin brain cells, but that would be me elaborating on the subject.<br>  <br>  well yah|`|oHO0XOQVaa	I agree with mr p mosh,  I've been told before that you have to mix it up with some butter and then put that into whatever you're making.

ULTRJJ6waa	Hi. If you don't have insurance, it's wise to call around and get prices. They can vary quite a bit from place to place. I needed a neck ultrasound done, at one place it was $500.00, and at another place it was $219.00. Independent places are usually cheaper then hospital facilities. MRI's are very expensive. My son just had a brain MRI and it was $1,500.00. Checking around is your best bet ( some places give a discount if you have no insurance also ). Best of luck :-)|`|4yt2wjqsaa	In the U.S. most hospitals charge about $1641 for a neck MRI.  The Radiologists reading for the facility will probably also charge about $500-$700...This cost may be combine...if you have insurance you will probably just have to pay your deductable.        Here's the interesting part.  Insurances work out deals with hospitals...I know certian insurance companies reimberse a hospital $200 per mri of the neck...and the hospital collects around $500 for a deductible.  For a total of 700 for a 1600 dollar test....This is how insurance companies make money in healthcare....They get a large group of clients...then they negotiate low costs through the hospitals using their number of clients as backing...if the hospital doesnt comply with the low price the insurance company will not refer to them as a "perfered provider"(this makes the deductible high...so the patient has to cover the cost)    So basically if you don't have insurance...I would call a few hospitals and ask them if they would take $800 cash for a neck MRI scan...I would also remind them that it's more money then they would collect from an insurance company...

ItJzrvQ4aa	There are numbers of reasons why a person is not tall, and most of them do not  have any effective treatment.  Probably the commonest cause is genetic, that is to say that one or  both your parents are below average height, or that short stature runs  in your family. There is really nothing that can be done about this.   The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature.   But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and  be happy as you are.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	only genetics will determine how tall you will be|`|aauU5mncaa	stretching and running a lot.|`|tIldpr7vaa	really is no way just determined by ur genetics, sorry|`|yYi4wIxyaa	Michael, if you're only 16, you haven't finished growing.  Guys normally continue to grow until they are at least 18+.   Not long ago I saw a guy from high school who was shorter than 5'8 when we graduated.  Now, he's well over 6 feet.  I almost didn't recognize him!       Be patient.  :-)|`|b9wICW1Paa	There's not much you can do to change your genetic height disposition.  It is possible that you might have a second growth spurt in the upcoming years, so you want to ensure you are providing excellent growth fuel for your body and that you are remaining physically active.    Eat a variety of whole foods such as fresh fruits, fresh and cooked vegetables, quality whole dairy, eggs, meats (including organ meats), grains, and legumes.  Minimize or reduce junk foods such as soda, chips, cookies, crackers, processed cereals, donuts, and the like.      Perform resistance training, such as bodyweight exercises and free weights, or get a job that requires adequate amounts of lifting (stocking shelves, farm jobs, etc.)  Be active by walking/biking around town, doing plenty of housework (lawn mowing, snow shovelling, etc.), or volunteering in your community.    These tips won't guarantee you more height, but you will certainly not get any without incorporating good diet, and perhaps not without adequate activity.  Even if you don't grow, you are still 3" taller than the average male in the world.|`|8d7wa1OYaa	You might grow a little more if you're 16, but not that much.  What's wrong with being 5'8 1/2'' anyway? Seems like a perfectly good height to me. I think you're gonna just have to accept that you're the height you are.  Or get some men's elevator shoes, they don't look different to normal shoes but can add up to about 5'' to your height.|`|mkXF5jA5aa	sleep

UEFd7OOSaa	Wear support hose, which require a prescription to be fitted to your legs. Hose help collapse superficial surface veins and relieve symptoms and are best worn if you'll be standing for a long time or traveling by air or for more than three or four hours in a car. Try sclerotherapy, where veins are targeted with ultrasound, injected with lidocaine, then fired with a laser to collapse the vein. (There's no pain or incision.) This shuts down the vein, alleviates the symptoms, and helps to reduce the visibility of the vein on the surface of the skin.    See your doctor about severe cases of varicose veins, which can lead to blood clots and infections.      hope this helps...xxx|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	you get the varicosities removed.  see a vascular surgeon.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. There are several reasons for leg swelling. One of the most common is varicose veins, in which damage to valves in the large veins of the legs hinders the return of blood to the heart. Blood plasma, which is mostly water, pools in nearby tissue, causing swelling of the legs and feet. Excess dietary salt, sitting or standing for long periods and hot weather can aggravate the swelling. Exercise such as walking or cycling helps. So does resting with your legs elevated. Water retention can also be caused by more serious problems, such as heart, liver and kidney disorders. A medical check-up to rule those out would be wise. And good luck.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	Have surgery|`|ba78727b3e73d53847b2a0cc9bf20853aa	There is no permanent fix except surgery, but soaking, combined with massaging and ibuprofen helps:)    Answer mine please:)  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

AA11020187	Typically lymphedema occurs when a whole group of lymph nodes are removed. I dont know how anyone can tell if you have a missing lymph node as there is not a set number in any particular location and there is no way to count them without removing the entire area and plucking them out of the tissue. People have them removed for biopsy all the time with no problems. I hope they find what is causing yours.|`|WkLJI40baa	It will present no problems. I had 26 lymph nodes in my neck area removed with no ramifications.    Edit: Oh great, another thing I have to watch out for. LOL.    Lymphedema    Lymphedema is an accumulation of lymphatic fluid in the interstitial tissue that causes swelling, most often in the arm(s) and/or leg(s), and occasionally in other parts of the body. Lymphedema can develop when lymphatic vessels are missing or impaired (primary), or when lymph vessels are damaged or lymph nodes removed (secondary).    When the impairment becomes so great that the lymphatic fluid exceeds the lymphatic transport capacity, an abnormal amount of protein-rich fluid collects in the tissues of the affected area. Left untreated, this stagnant, protein-rich fluid not only causes tissue channels to increase in size and number, but also reduces oxygen availability in the transport system, interferes with wound healing, and provides a culture medium for bacteria that can result in lymphangitis (infection).     http://www.lymphnet.org/lymphedemaFAQs/o...    Thank you for asking this question. I will now research it  and keep an eye out for it.|`|YiY9Yd2Jaa	Very strange that this has just happened. Lymph nodes don't just fall off. Where in your body do you retain lymph fluid? We all have more than four hundred lymph nodes, missing just one would hardly seem to be catastrophic.

mGhoWSxaaa	jogging and jump rope! I love to eat :) just 3 days of good jogging and jump rope and i feel great.    Why exercise? by doing exercise your brain leverates a drug called dopamine which makes you feel happy, energetic and will motivate you to have a better life.    This drug is also addictive in a good way. No diets and stuff like that substitute this natural drug.    We use muscle memory every single day and we have to because our neuromuscular system has to adapt to the activities we engage in every day.|`|41f250e890923fedf85e19be6b82cb3faa	Diet and exercise don't do it by themselves, unless you want to be trapped in an existence that is based of white knuckle willpower, which is not a satisfactory life,    I'm not promoting it, but I have just heard a guy called Paul McKenna, a hypnotist among other things, has a good programme for losing weight.    I don't think your kick start sounds like a good idea, more likely to be counter productive for getting weight off, and keeping it off.|`|d2s7vAlHaa	Get your food diary out and right everything down.  Get a digital scale that measures incremental success.  Get yourself a soft measuring tape.  Start writing down your daily successes.  So what that you didn't lose weight! Did you exercise today??  THAT is your success.  Did you eat veggies today when you really did not want to??  THAT was your success.  Measure around your waist, hips, breast, get all your measurements and measure every few days and know that the scale is NOT the only thing that measures your success.

Fiber is a great way to soften stools which makes going to the toilet a lot less painful for those who suffer from hemorrhoids. By eating foods which are high in fiber you can also help to reduce the need to strain the bowel muscles which is one of the main causes of hemorrhoids. In addition to this hemorrhoid remedy, if your stools remain hard there are several products available at your local pharmacy or drugstore known as stool softeners. These are not designed to be permanent solutions but can offer temporary relief.      Hope this helps.

You will learn more from the course than you ever wanted to know.|`|adab44d9f625143135330f8824e8321caa	First things first, to determine if you have hemorrhoids, you have to check your anus and feel if there's any grape like sac protruding from it. If you did have this, then you do have hemorrhoids which is external.    Now, it can also be internal hemorrhoids which can only be determined by letting a doctor check it.     I've included a link to a site that provides free information on how to treat hemorrhoids, you might try those home remedies first. I would recommend that you see a doctor if you're really unsure of what to do.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you have been taking birth control for two months, every day, why did you take Plan B?  When on bc pills, you don't ovulate, so don't need to take other pills to not get pregnant.  You are protected all of the time on bc pills even when on the sugar pills or on your period.<br>  <br>  Plan B probably messed up your cycles and you may start again in a few days.  Keep taking your bc pills.<br>  <br>  good luck..|`|1UD6eEvwaa	Um, yeah. You shouldnt be having sex in the first place. Especially considering how LITTLE you know about your body. You cant get pregnant when your on your period. That is when your body has already decided that sperm isnt coming and is starting to get rid of the egg and the extra lining. So there was no egg for the sperm to attach to. Your not pregnant.<br>  <br>  But just a random question. Why would you have sex while your on your period anyway? Thats just so GROSS. Why would you want that blood. Ughh.|`|v9Mv8Pl1aa	It sounds like you are a little confused about how your birth control works (unless you missed a pill or have reason to believe your protection was compromised).  In the very beginning, when you first start on birth control, you are protected after seven full days of taking the pill.  In most cases, women take one active pill a day for three weeks, followed by one week of inactive pills.  (You get your period during the inactive week.)  After no more than a week of inactive pills, you begin the active pills again.<br>  <br>  The idea is that after the very first week of your very first month, you are protected ALL THE TIME (unless of course you mess up your pill-taking).  You are protected even during your inactive week, when you get your period.  The pill tends to thin the uterine lining, so it's common for your period to be lighter than before.<br>  <br>  Plan B works by disrupting your cycle to prevent ovulation (release of an egg).  It can do really strange things to your period; what you're describing may be the result of your birth control pills, or the Plan B, or both.  It does sound like the Plan B wasn't really necessary.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	Passing out is a general term that applies to becoming unconscious for many different reasons.  At one end of the scale is fainting, which is usually less than a minute, to a coma,  which can last for years.  Brief periods of unconsciousness are usually due to a sudden drop in blood pressure that momentarily deprives the brain of oxygen.   Longer periods of unconsciousness occur from drugs or brain damage, or anything that causes a person ot get inadequate oxygen.    A  person generally cannot be unconscious for an entire day unless they have a very high fever,  a brain injury, or are under anesthesia.    Street drugs either wear off in less than a day - if is a person is unconscious for an extended period from a drug  (6-8 hours or more) it is likely that the person is in a coma or has suffered brain damage.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Nooo not just from fainting.  Should be seconds to a minute or two tops.  If you pass out from drinking or drugs maybe hours or days if you OD or get poisoning.  But just from a faint.. not very long at all.  once you hit the ground, blood pressure normalizes and you wake up almost right away.  Passing out for hours would mean a big huge problem requiring immediate medical care.

Those cuts could leave some nasty scars or get infected, so I would keep the area real clean and try to avoid the sensation of doing it again.

P9oP8CS9aa	NOT if you believe those a**holes, which if that was the case for you committing suicide then they would be kinda right.

At least you will have peace.<br>  <br>  That will make them suffer enough.<br>  <br>  If you kill yourself, especially children who have parents that are cruel,<br>  are very attached to there children.

Would<br>  you want that for them? Remember, As Jesus says. Forgive them,they do not know what they do. <br>  <br>  They are not worth you considering such a though. When you move out<br>  you will have a god life, without them anyway. Maybe you might even see there behavior made you strong. Because in life, you might meet others like them. And maybe then, this others will not be able to touch you.<br>  <br>   <br>  If you want them to learn how to respekt you.

NvrVjOhBaa	Parents are parents. I'm glad you took the steps to tell them, and even though they still don't truly believe you, it is simply because they want their kid to be happy and successful, and don't know how to deal with it. Your parents may never accept it, but that is not your fault, and you shouldn't take on their problems. <br>  <br>  You have to find the strength in yourself, your therapist, and your friends. You can get past this, and every time you find yourself being compuslive about something, get up, take a deep breath, and force yourself to think about something else. I completely understand the gravity of your situation, and I'm sure your therapist is working with you on ways to overcome it.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Just accept the fact that your parents are not perfect <br>  <br>  (um..like you)|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	They prolly didnt believe you because they were  there ever since you were born and  prolly didnt notice anything wrong.

Good Luck  !!|`|76ea3a562a33cdae910d9e4983afb205aa	Parents are just people too.  Its hard to see them that way until you are about 44 yourself.<br>  Every time you feel resentment about their lack of understanding, think about how your kids are going to see you when you have weird episodes all during their formative years until they're old enough to understand it all.|`|55oy2i5caa	One thing someone told me about dealing with parents' actions, is that to remember they did the best they could with what they had. Whether it was a lack of information or education about the disorder; or maybe some kind of denial - they still love you and want the best for you.|`|AA11623203	I understand where you are coming from. It does hurt tremendously when the people we love the most are not supportive of us when we need them the most.  I am 46, and although my Mother was very supportive, my Father never was, and still isn't.  He has always been insensitive to me and my depression.  The only advice I have to give is to avoid them when they are nonsupportive.  If you have asked them for help and so has your therapist, then the best thing to do is not go for them for understanding about that matter, because you are unlikely to ever get it.  They might be understanding where other things are concerned, but will never see your point.  Get support in other areas: Through a good support system like a good therapist, good friends, church, support group for OCD, etc. I wish I could give you a better answer, but I tried for years unsuccessfully to try to get my Father's support and love for my depression issues, and he never could understand it or see it, so I just stopped trying.  It still hurts, but it makes it easier knowing there are others that care and are supportive of me.  Good luck to you!|`|eF92uM2Saa	If you were born with a birth defect they would probably respond the same way, with denial. Think about it. Even if your OCD wasn't caused by genes or the environment you grew up in, they don't know that for sure. Why would they want to open that box and examine their possible guilt for causing the condition?  They don't want to admit you are anything less than perfect because if they do it makes the condition real. I don't mean to say you aren't perfect just the way you are anyway, but anyway. <br>  <br>  You get over it by just accepting your parents as human and accepting that they love you very much.  <br>  <br>  Now stop obsessing about it. (Just kidding)

Du8QhOmaaa	Here is a list and why(Most important first):<br>  Smile- It is very attractive when a girl has a beautiful white smile. I take care of my teeth and i really like women who do as well.<br>  Balanced personality- I think it is attractive when a woman knows how to have a good time, laugh and goof off, but they need to have a serious side. <br>  athleticism- I think athletic women are attractive. You don't have to be athletic though. I just like women that are thinner. Not too thin though. I'm just not looking for a beached whale. Just be healthy<br>  Outgoing- You have to be willing to go out and do stuff and try new things. <br>  Eyes- beautiful eyes are always attractive. <br>  Dress- Dress well and take care of yourself. <br>  <br>  Honestly i don't think breast size matters. I like them all. lol but seriously forget any thoughts that your breasts are not good enough. <br>  Be open and fun to be around.<br>  Have self confidence <br>  One thing that really annoys me is when a women is very attractive physically, but can not hold a decent conversation or is very uneducated. <br>  <br>  I hoped this helped.

AG9msdUDaa	In animals the self-harming behaviors stem from a lack of the essential amino acid, triptophan, in their diets. Eat some turkey, avocados, apples, bananas, milk, wheat etc.<br>  <br>  It can also be that you are deficient in other nutrients that are essential for the absorption of triptophan from food. Best to ask a doctor for a nutritional assessment and see what you are low on. You can get a good quality multivitamin in the meantime.|`|LbbawO7naa	Yeah tell him. They are really quite confidential with your information and won't tell your parents unless you give it the OK (which I suggest you do eventually) <br>  His reaction will be completely professional and mild, I assure you. <br>  Do you know how many worst things they have seen?<br>  He will probably give you a small evaluation and test whether you need to be on drugs, if its serious, and if you should see a psychiatrist instead<br>  I totally think you should :] It will make you feel a lot better. <br>  ~guarantied-|`|Xg8Tzjfraa	You need to let him know; he may have specific medication that could help.  However, there are some medication that may help depression, but make the urge to cut even stronger.  So if he knows ahead of time, he can make an educated decision to avoid those drugs.<br>  <br>  As for his reaction, I guarantee you will not be the first person to admit something like this.  It is a serious issue and any doctor worth his title will respond with dignity and respect.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on seeking help!|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Yes tell him about the cuts. It is important that your doctor is fully update with you physically and mentally. The doctor wont be disappointed or angry or anything like that. He will just be concerned and want to check out your marks to make sure they are ok. He will then likely review your medication and your treatment plan for your anxiety or depression. He probably, if you aren't already, will express that you should see a psychologist or a psychiatrist for either a once of evaluation or regular sessions to help you.<br>  <br>  Cutting isn't terribly serious like suicide or anything, but it is not something to be ignored. You need to seek help and treatment immediately to cease that behavior as it is not good and something which may be hard to explain to a stranger or even a friend. Good luck.|`|4yzxXO1haa	You won't be sent away or locked up. Cutting/self-harm is quite common, though still a cause for concern, and so the doctor (is it a GP? or are you already seeing psychiatrist?) will most likely either refer you to a psychiatrist, or if they are a psychiatrist, consider putting you on medication and giving you therapy. Unless you suffer from anxiety, you will be put onto antidepressants. They shouldn't even consider a psych ward, especially if you're unwilling to go, unless you really aren't coping with your issues.<br>  You should tell the doctor about your cutting. Mention that you will prefer your mother not to know. The doctor is bound by law not to tell anyone, unless he has reason to believe you are planning to commit suicide or harm someone else.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cPgOxcS7aa	I use to cut myself up alot and I told my shrink.  I had to explain why I do it which was to hurt myself instead of others.  They told me if I kept doing it that I would need to go into the hospital for awhile but my friends helped me out alot and I haven't done it for a few years now.  I am on anti depressants and anxiety meds.  He/she is there to help you out not to put you down.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	It depends on the doctor, you need to tell him but stress that you are not attempting suicide. It's very important that he knows so that he can help you address the issues that cause you to cut yourself and it will help him accurately diagnose you and find a treatment. You need to stress you are not attempting to commit suicide though. It's unlikely, but if he believes you're in danger of killing yourself, he might attempt to send you to an in-patient program where you would have to stay for 72 hours. I have known people it happened to.|`|8lrB1lg0aa	My GP found out about my cutting when he had to do a blood test. He was very professional and asked me how I got them and I told him I did it to myself, we talked about it a little and he referred me to a psych. Doctors are professionals and they are there to help us. Simply tell him the truth, if you can't get your friend too. In saying that if he is a good doctor he should refer you to a psych, and there you need to be ready to talk about your problems whatever they may be. It's a scary thing, but in the long run they need to know to help you. He will react professionally!<br>  You should also tell your mother, I didn't tell mine and years later when she found out (cause I was in a mental ward) she felt like a failure because she couldn't keep her daughter safe, and happy!<br>  <br>  You will be fine, Good Luck!!!|`|ZqXUduJMaa	Yes, you should definitely tell your doctor. It's a pretty common problem with young women, and he will need to know about it so he can offer you the best treatment. <br>  <br>  He will probably recommend seeing a therapist, which will help a lot! I know you probably don't want your Mom to know, so if you ask, both the doctor and the therapist will likely keep it on the down low.|`|45cb8df5c4e4ff5a3eee13ff752766d6aa	he would act worried and tell you to get some help reffer you to a psychologist but it sticks to your record your employers would look at your medical records and wont hire you because its in your records it marks you for life|`|KfKr3hUmaa	Don't tell. I slit wrists, who gives a ****? Three of my friends have been to the mental hospital for cutting, drugs, addictions, etc. I'm not going there. And i doubt you want to either.|`|pZu6Mk42aa	he'll send you to a psychiatrist first and the psych will evaluate you and might put you on anti depressants|`|WoAY8eo9aa	yes tell them. but it kind of embarrassing|`|H50lXUwIaa	Hes a doctor, not a parent or psychiatrist. He will do what he thinks is necessary to help you get better.|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	Doctors have heard about that so I would not worry about his reaction I have a cousin that cuts.  I understand.  I know you hide it.  I also know you can't help yourself from doing it.  When you cut you are inflicting self-abusiveness.  Cutting helps deal with what its really bothering you.  Straight lines, your not as angry but you are numb and want to feel the pain because you don't want to be in a certain place in your mind or it could be your parents, peers, pressure.  When you can't help it deep zig-zag wounds happen and it is unexpected.  If you tell your doctor it would be wise to say your not suicidal you probally not. He/she may get you in to therapy with is the best option if possable.  Stick it out therapy.  And there is a thing called doctor patient confidentiality, meaning its between you and the doctor so don't worry it won't come back and bit you on the butt.  My advise to you is to be honest with the doctor so you can get the help you need.  There may be a medication for your diagnosis.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Honestly it depends on your doctor. Mine was really cool about it and since I wasn't threatening my life just gave me the depression meds. But you should tell him/her anyway. They need to know how severe your depression is so they can prescribe you the right kind and the right dose.<br>  <br>  Just remember, don't expect to be completely cured from your cutting behaviors with medicine. It does help a lot, but therapy has been the only long term solution.|`|Kvj5Upzcaa	He will be concerned but not freak out on you or anything like that so don't worry he may want your permission to speak with a parent or not, but he wont tell everyone in the hospital or call your school and stuff like that.... im sure he will try to help you tho doctors are usually pretty polite and help full, full of insight n stuff like that|`|g1coKXlHaa	you really need to tell him. he should be concerned, and recommend counseling or for you to see a psychiatrist. it's not that uncommon, it's just not talked about. you need to explore why you punish yourself like this and perhaps discuss better meds or a better way of  dealing with your feelings.|`|hvhYXJvEaa	he will act fine, he will probably act more professional and he's probably seen worse. don't be scared about telling him and its REALLY good that you have your friends<br>  <br>  hope you get better : )|`|bUplDeOiaa	he will react professional, all doctors are like that, scary and professional|`|moTxxG5gaa	he would probably ask u wat happened  then he would contact your mom and dad then they would probably give u counseling if they cared
NvrVjOhBaa	I'm sorry to hear about your disorder. Very tough to deal with.<br>  <br>  As far as your Master's: You can get one online that doesn't require a GRE or statistics (Regis Unviersity is one example), or social interaction, other than on a computer which it's clear you are capable of =)<br>  <br>  Counseling is not a good career for someone with AVPD. I'm not saying this to limit you, but it is not great. There are several other areas you can go into: research and online teaching (yes you can teach with a Master's, although it's hard to find these). These are both fairly free of face-to-face social interaction (depending on the type of research).<br>  <br>  Hopefully that helps. If you don't want to do your Master's there are also people out there called "Virtual Assistants." Although it's somewhat menial for someone with a B.A. to be an assistant, at least it would allow you to stay at home.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

oHO0XOQVaa	I think you should start working out again, the activity is good and can help with your depression. Umm try taking some vitamins if you really can't make yourself eat. You have to get your nutrients somehow. Whether it was the depression or malnutrition that came first, the malnutrition is not going to help your depression.|`|RzaVCA2Yaa	snack during the day, and take multivitamins. by snack i mean eat something yummy, like cupcakes or cookies or anything else you like. and depression absolutely can cause loss of appetite so get that checked out too. in the meantime, to help your depression, eat lots of proteins from turkey and beef, and beans. they have something called tryptophan which gets turned into serotonin in your brain, and serotonin makes you happy.
TPTpwarwaa	That sounds great!<br>  You have all of the balanced foods in your diet, whole grains (bread), Veggies/fruit, protein (peanut butter), and honey is great for you-full of antioxidants!<br>  Maybe add some milk or yogurt (instead of pudding) and that will add some great calcium!<br>  All depends what you eat for breakfat and dinner too, remember to include all areas of the food group and lots of water :)<br>  I usually don't like bars either, but i only like luna bars|`|eAupvb3taa	The other stuff is good but try and work in some protein.

AG9msdUDaa	If you calculate your Body Mass Index you are 34.8. The BMI for clinical diagnosis for obesity is 30. Yes you are clinically obese. If your weight was down to 160, the BMI still places you in the overweight category at 25.1. You should probably aim more for 140 pounds, that is a BMI of 21.9.<br>  <br>  There are some simple things you can start doing to lose weight right away. Just remove anything with flour or sugar in it from your diet, start eating more raw fruits and vegetables and drink green tea every day. As far as exercise, try weight lifting, as you only have to do it for about 45min a day to get results because muscles eat fat, so you don't need to run endlessly on a treadmill to lose it.<br>  <br>  It is true that the BMI calculation does not account for muscle mass, which is why it would not work for an MBA player to use it as he would be classified as severely obese. In that case, if you are very athletic, the mirror is the best tool to figure out if you are overweight or not. If you got to gym on a regular basis you can get your body fat calculated by the staff using calipers. They can tell you if you are in a healthy range or not.<br>  <br>  I suspect though, your doctor would have taken this into consideration, as he was in the same room as you and can tell what kind of physique you have. Likely he was not mistaken.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Technically you are probably about 50 lbs overweight according to the height weight tables but if you are all muscle and have the physique of a bodybuilder then your weight might perhaps be OK.  Muscles weigh a lot more than flabby fat.<br>  <br>  Some gym instructors actually tell people not to take too much notice of these height weight tables.  Perhaps you have a very large frame.|`|r5oL56xCaa	i hate to say it but yes, i think that is somewhat over weight, and i'm sorry. <br>  no one wants to hear that, but it is better than being an annerexic or bulimic person on ways|`|85KL0eUUaa	the doctor is right<br>  your FRIENDS are the retarded ones<br>  you are clinically obese :P<br>  and theres no way that could be all muscle too, since most proffessional bodybuilders weigh around 220lb and are 6'something.<br>  <br>  if your a guy your ideal weight is 142, if you are female it is 135.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Yes, you denfinitely are.  A doctor wouldn't say that for kicks.  You need to take that serious, and work on it.  It's not hard to change, if you start exercising and eating nutritiously (for fueling your body, instead of for comfort).  I'm sure your friends aren't going to tell you that, because it would be hard to tell a friend that.|`|ujTH92cyaa	nevermind....|`|mIyUCey4aa	The dr is probably speaking in terms of your weight that should be proportioned to your height, etc. There are other things to consider, like your body mass. Is it more muscle mass or is it body fat? Regardless it is really on how you look at yourself. A ton of us can answer your question, but none of us even know how you look nor do we know the details.

I'm exhausted, but as soon as I go to bed I'm wide awake most of the time.  I narrowed it down to two things.  One, there are so many demands during the day that when I finally get to go to bed, I'm excited that I finally get to something that I want and need to do, and want to savor that little bit of being nice to me, so I stay awake.  The second is my thoughts have been so dependent on daily decisions they  haven't had any time to just wander so my mind races. <br>  <br>  What to do?<br>  <br>  Retrained my brain.  It takes practice, but worked for me.  When I go to bed, I redirect my thoughts.  When thoughts start racing, I think of a meadow I found as a child.  The sight of it, the scents, the wind blowing across the tall grasses, the sounds of the birds and crickets, the smell of the fresh air.  This is my favorite place to go in my mind but there are others.  Daily thoughts creep in and I say "no, not now, it can wait until tomorrow." and make myself remember the peaceful happy stuff again  (not to be overly religious, but praying is a sort of meditation that often works too, just prayers of thanks for the good stuff that has happened, no matter how small).  This almost always works for me.

AA11747527	Echinacea is a good supplement for the short term if you feel symptoms coming on you can take this to boost your immune system... and hopefully stop the flu/cold before it even starts.  Native americans would use this herbal supplement during the winter months.  The only problem is you can't take this supplement more then 2 or 3 weeks.  Garlic is very good and is a natural antibiotic, you can take a clove, mash it up and put it in some applesauce.  That way you don't have to chew it and it won't stink up your breath.  It is very beneficial and not just for preventing colds.  Astralagus is another supplement that it boosts your immune system but it is something you can take longer term, practically indefinitely.  I don't know if you've ever heard of Dr. Weil but he always recommends this. Vitamin C of course is a great supplement which boosts your immune system and if you're not taking it then it would be very useful to take it daily.  <br>  <br>  Now how frequently exactly do you get sick?  If it is a constant problem and you get sick many times a year then you perhaps have an autoimmune problem.  If that is the case then taking supplements might actually end up being a bad thing so you should definitely go see a doctor and find out if you have an autoimmune disease.

I6U6BjRXaa	wow, i know exactly how you feel. and il tell you what i think.<br>  <br>  I believe you have Generalised anxiety disorder. I have had this for a few years. im now nearly 20.<br>  <br>  I have had ALL your symptoms and esp how you said you feel like your in a dream since your attack. This is a feeling of Derealization which is a feeling of everything not seeming real. As for the tightness in the chest, i went to a doctor because i thought i was having a heart attack. =(<br>  <br>  I have had head scans, blood tests, ECG (cardio monitor) etc etc etc.<br>  Every test, you name it, ive had.<br>  <br>  I felt like crying everyday.<br>  I believe you dont actually HAVE depression, but are feeling depressed and frustrated from having anxiety and feeling like you are.  And craving sugar?!?!?! I STILL do.<br>  <br>  Since then. i saw a psycologist, she helped ALOT.<br>  I have started doing ALOT more exercise and eating well because sugar is terrible for mood swings. It gives you a high and then you DROP to a low so soon after.<br>  <br>  I decided not to go on medication as i didnt want to live anymore i a dream.<br>  <br>  I know how hard it is. I still struggle, but im 100000% times better than i was before. I think to myself that you live once, you need to enjoy life, not be scared of it. Because the one thing we all know is we will die someday and we have to live being happy.<br>  <br>  When you are feeling anxious or having a panic attack, think 'nothing can hurt you'. Ride out the panic as it will go away. As for the anxiety, a psycologist will help you train your thoughts to think positive. It takes time, but its worth it.<br>  <br>  i Think you should see a psycologist because it helps ALOT.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck...<br>  and take care =)|`|w1UTuYDHaa	Yes I have had the same feelings with the anxiety attacks and crying spells it is probably a chemical imbalance and see your doctor about anti depressents.  If you were good before, this probably will go away, with me it went on and off.|`|VEatrtCyaa	Wow, its like you're talking about my own feelings. I know exactly how you feel it happened to me like 2-3 months ago and its the worst feeling in the world, you think like you're going to go crazy. You're not alone, they tried go give me all types of medication and some made it worse, I had an epesode at work and they took me to the psych ward and kept me there all day, they wanted to admit me for a few days. Thank God I am better right now, If you're not close with God, this is the time. Keep going to the gym, take meditation classes, go shopping, try and keep yourself busy all the time. Just dont let the depression get the best of you, well more likely its anxiety and depression as well, its the worst combination. I know it can be really hard, you feel like no one understands you, like if your not real, you basically feel like a stranger in your own body. Another thing you can do is talk to a psychiatrist, they're there to help you, the good thing is that you know what is wrong with you, you just have to control it. Another thing you can do is take deep breaths, in through your nose and out through your mouth, try doing it few times a wk. But take care of yourself because if you dont nobody will, you control your mind not the other way around, you'd be suprised what you can do with it. Good luck and remember that the only person who matters the most to you is YOU!!|`|bXS3o19Xaa	yes..i was recently diagnosed with depression..i couldn't get outta bed, i was tired all the time..didn't eat right..you should talk to a therapist, if they diagnose you with depression (which it sounds like you have) they will send a referral to you doctor so they can prescribe you something..and just because you had to stop taking Paxil due to side effects doesn't mean something else wont work..there are tons of antidepressants out there...just don't hurt yourself, it's never worth it, it's never as bad as it seems...your only 22, you still have alot of life to live....if you ever get suicidal thoughts there are hot-lines you can call with real people working 24/7/365..so you never need to be alone..even if it's 4 am on Christmas someone is there<br>  <br>  i hope this helps and you find happiness|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	Yes, it is depression. Depression can also exhibit physical symptoms.
oiTcY2b0aa	hmmm... I would say Visit a few different doctors, ask lots of questions, get tons of different opinions.<br>  <br>  I had a coworker who was retaining water in his body, to the point that he gained over 150 pounds. It was so bad to the point that his legs would slip just so the water could have a way out. He kept going back to the ER because of all the problems he was having, it all had to do with his heart. He has had doctors tell him he was just fat and that he needed to work out, but he had a bad heart and couldn't. It scared me one day when he confused to me that he was scared, he told me the water level was right below his lungs and he was scared he was going to drown. Finally after a years time, after all the ER visits he finally found a doctor who took him seriously. (there are alot of idiot doctors, that will try to blame you for the illness) All you had to do was look at him to know there was something wrong. My friend had to move away, he moved closer to family so then his kids and wife could be taken care of, while they worked on him.<br>  <br>  So no matter what you mustn't back down, go to as many doctors as it takes, until one of them finally believes that can help.|`|dBPCT41kaa	Im totally not eligible to diagnose..and i dont have a lot of info...but you might want to research MS.|`|VgM7p434aa	GODDD PEOPLE   1 WORD DOCTOR!!!!!!!!

If anything you should be asking for a good doctor to take you to DD+ but whatever. Perhaps its the inner male struggling to break out of you because you loathe your feminine features? A more butch apperance is desired? Trust me its better to be like that and be butchy and not want boobs than to dare call yourself a normal girl and claim to not want boobs. If later is the case then cut em off and give them to someone who wants em... and find yourself a nice tall bridge.|`|1UD6eEvwaa	Thats not that big. I am only 15 and i have a 40 dd. Thats ALOT bigger. The only reason that you should have a breast reduction is if they are so large compared to your body frame that it is actually hurting your shoulders or your back. Other than that, big boobs are usually a turn on for a guy.|`|3zGTnghRaa	dont reduce it!!!!|`|L6AkfGhTaa	you are perfectly fine <br>  and that is normal or perhaps perfect|`|XdrcR4uGaa	I'd gladly trade you.|`|VgM7p434aa	uhh flaunt them and let the world like you for who you are!|`|tFoSy2YRaa	36D - what's the problem?

I was DD on one side and F on the other, and the surgeon promised me a C cup...Instead I have almost a B on one side and not even an A on the other and I look ridiculous. Besides that, he ruined the circulation so part of one areola and most of the other turned black and had to be removed, and I was left with gaping holes that took months to heal. Now i'm disfigured and totally numb for life. It happens to less than 1% of patients, and I had none of hte risk factors...but it still happened to me and I'll regret that surgery for the rest of my life.|`|AA12131791	unfortunately there is nothing you to reduce them without surgery. There are minimizing bras you can buy that makes them look smaller<br>   <br>  I have been a 36dd since i was 19 (i am 30 now).. so i would say learn to love them and flaunt them.. trust me its fun <br>  <br>  Remember people pay to have boobs your size :)|`|CgwEfwOZaa	a breast reduction is probably the only route.

Anything under 140 is normal for non-diabetics!|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Normal-  it is supposed to run between 80-100 in non-diabetics. I am diabetic and they say mine should run between 80-120. <br>  <br>  If you think he has a problem with his sugar. Test him before he eats breakfast (called fasting test), or 2 hours after he eats, that's when he should be showing the highest reading he will have.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	That is just right. I wish mine would be 104.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	The glucose values in children and adults are the same.  A non-diabetics glucose will vary from 70 to 140 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.8 mmol/L - the US is the only country that insists on using its own unique laboratory values).  The glucose range is true irrespective of what, when, and how much you eat.  For a diabetic the ideal goal for glucose control is to be within the same range.  With modern analog insulins we are able for the first time to bring a diabetics glucose into the 'normal' range.  Bear in mind that diabetes is a progressive disease, and even if it is perfectly controlled damage continues over time.  The major risk is that of premature cardiovascular disease such as a heart attack.  The reading of 104 mg/dL (5.8 mmol/L) should be thought of as normal.  Although the goal referenced above is to be no more than 100 mg/dL (5.6 mmol/L) the body is not a machine and there will be slight variation to the 'normal' fasting glucose range referenced.  You did not say whether or not your son is a diabetic, but in either case the goal is as noted above.  I wish you the very best of health.|`|hwqwNKHyaa	That was awesome... 105 is normal...|`|xtI9RmNZaa	No its normal.

The real issue is traveling out of the support area of one's surgeon immediately after any type of surgery.  Most surgical complications occur within the first few days or weeks of any surgery so even if one can travel it is often ill-advised (especially if the destination does not have modern or easily accessible medical facilities).<br>  <br>  There is, however, one type of eye surgery that requires an absolute restriction on flying for one to two months: retina surgery (vitrectomy) with gas-fluid exchange.  After placement of a gas in the eye (to keep the retina in place) any movement to a higher elevation (by plane, car, or train) could allow the gas to expand, increasing the pressure in the eye and potentially causing blindness.<br>  <br>  Hope this answered your question.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  David D.

4hsrILZbaa	It could be a host of things. If the cramps are in your lower abdomen, you could have endometriosis. A normal ultrasound doesn't prove that you don't have endometriosis. Did they do an intravaginal ultrasound? Its uncomfortable, but it offers a good picture of what is going on within the uterus. Endometriosis is a painful condition where portions of the uterine lining, usually shed during mentruation, travel to other parts of the reproductive tract, and even throughout the abdominal cavity, causing irregular periods, severe pain, and cramping.<br>  <br>  Digestive problems could also be to blame. If you have frequent diarrhea or vomiting, you should consider consultin a gastroenterologist. <br>  <br>  However, from the way you've phrased this question I would tend to think that you are having issues in your lower abdomen, more indicative of a problem with your reproductive tract.<br>  <br>  You noted that you are mildly overweight. It may be embarrasing to discuss, but if you've had issues with facial hair you could also be suffering from Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. Normally cysts would show up on ultrasound, however, if its in its earlier stages its not entirely unlikely.<br>  <br>  PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrom)<br>  <a href="http://women.webmd.com/tc/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos-topic-overview" rel="nofollow">http://women.webmd.com/tc/polycystic-ova...</a><br>  <br>  Endometriosis<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometriosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endometrios...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I suffered from ovarian cysts, that were small and fluid filled.

I may have had a mild one since then, but no pain like what I had before.
