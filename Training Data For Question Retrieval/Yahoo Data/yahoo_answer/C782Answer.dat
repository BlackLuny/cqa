CnEmETVfaa	Hi Tonya!!<br>  <br>  What I usually do is collect and keep copies of the menus from my favorite pizza delivery places.  Also, many pizza delivery and take out restaurants now have their menus available on-line, along with descriptions of their dishes (that are other than pizza) and the dishes nutritional information.<br>  <br>  At my house there are always one or two kids who want to order something other than pizza.  When the food is delivered, I ask if I can have a bit of whatever isn't pizza.  I can also assess the quality of the food, just by my families comments and facial expressions.<br>  <br>  So good luck and good "eats" ordering dinner tonight!!!|`|yCYw735Aaa	medium cheese with pepperoni green peppers and mushrooms|`|AA11786341	calzones|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Cheese pizza.|`|tmyiEtWhaa	super sized cheese filled crust pizza with ham beef and pepperoni<br>  and garlic bread with cheese and bbq ribs or bbq wings|`|iR3wIKNZaa	A large pizza with green peppers,ham,salami,mushrooms,garlic,pine... and double cheese.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Philly Cheesesteak Pizza|`|AA11402528	chicken, broccoli, onion pizza and garlic knots|`|AA10423186	both

If you're cooking for one, it's often cheaper to go get value menu fast food--but no one wants to eat that stuff forever.<br>  <br>  Go to the store and write down some prices of regular items.  Then look up restaurant prices.  I know that spinach artichoke dip costs about 4 dollars to make at home (frozen spinach, jar of artichoke hearts, mazarella cheese, cream, sour cream, and parmesan cheese), but costs at least 7 dollars at a restaurant--for about 1/3 as much as you make at home.  I love spinach artichoke dip.  Realizing the price difference on that menu item is what got me started cooking every night.<br>  <br>  Things like cakes from the bakery or specialty pastries, however, can be a lot cheaper to buy already made.  But fried chicken or vegetables or burgers?  Much much cheaper at home.|`|1HHgP3WCaa	This will depend on how many people that you are feeding, and what you are wanting to eat.

But this is what I have learned over the years to help me.  When planning meals, especially for one or two people, plans many meals from one thing.  Say I make a roast?  Too much for 2 people to eat a whole roast.  But we have roast and veggies ones day, sandwiches the next day, beef stroganoff another and then may a shepards pie to finish it all off.  I freeze what I don't use and then do a beef stew or soup and use up the left overs.  So really, being smart and practical, I make more meals out of the same thing, just tweaking it and playing around.  I can whip out a meal for about $2 that is filling, healthy, and inexpensive without must effort at all.  I will round it out with some veggies, a salad, drinks and what not.  And still comes out to less that $2 a meal!  I cannot eat out for that with a drink,  a salad and a meal!  I might get a burger though for a $1 but it won't be really a meal for a $1.  So yes, but mostly no!  Cheaper to eat your own home cooked meals and more healthy to boot and you know whats in it! Oh and they taste way better at home, I think!|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	Some food can be purchased cheaply but the ingredients are inferior and probably the portions are small.

Drain and put into a mixing bowl.  Add to the meat a can of corn, drained, and a can of mixed veggies, drained.  You can add any kind you want - green beans, peas, etc.  Add a 1 jar of a good brown gravy.  Add about 1/4 tsp of season salt.  Mix well and place in a 8x8 baking dish.   You can use 2 cups of mashed potatoes or I buy a container of premade mashed potatoes - do not use instant.  I follow the heating directions on the package for the microwave.  Once potatoes are hot, I add 1/2 a bar of cream cheese that I have cubed and softened to room temp, 1 clove of garlic, minced, and 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Mix until the cream cheese is mixed well with the potatoes.  Layer this on top of your meat in the baking dish.  Sprinkle a cup of shredded cheddar cheese on top of that.  Bake in a preheated oven at 375 degrees for 20 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.  <br>  <br>  Really easy and delicious.

Try this ...<br>  <br>  COTTAGE or SHEPHERD’S PIE <br>  <br>  Serves 2<br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS<br>  <br>  375g of old potatoes*<br>  1 onion<br>  1 carrot<br>  250ml of water <br>  ? of a teaspoon of salt<br>  ? a tablespoon of butter<br>  ? a tablespoon of milk <br>  Ground pepper to taste<br>  ? a tablespoon of sunflower oil<br>  250g of minced meat (Use minced beef for a cottage pie. Use minced lamb for a shepherd’s pie.)<br>  125ml of water<br>  1 stock cube (Use a beef stock cube for a cottage pie. Use a lamb stock cube for a shepherd’s pie.) <br>  <br>  METHOD<br>  <br>  Peel the potatoes and chop into quarters. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces. Cut both ends off the carrot, peel it and then grate it.<br>  <br>  Put the 250ml of water and salt into a saucepan on a medium heat. Add the potatoes. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on the saucepan and cook for 20 to 25 minutes until soft. Check the water level from time to time and top up if it starts to dry out. <br>  <br>  While the potatoes are cooking, put the oil in a frying pan on a medium heat. Fry the onion for a couple of minutes. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the meat and cook for another 5 minutes. Add the carrot. Crumble the stock cube into the 125ml of water and pour it into the frying pan. Cook for another 5 minutes until most of the water has boiled off. <br>  <br>  Drain the potatoes and mash with the butter and milk until it is smooth and lump free. Season with the pepper.<br>  <br>  Put the meat mixture into an ovenproof dish. Level off the surface. Put the mashed potato on top. Spread to cover the meat mixture. Make artistic swirls in the mashed potato. This increases the surface area and makes the top crisper. <br>  <br>  Cook in a preheated oven at 180°C, 350°F, gas mark 4 for 20 to 30 minutes until golden on top. <br>  <br>  ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES<br>  <br>  Use minced pork, but then it ought to be called a swineherd’s pie. Use minced turkey, but then it ought to be called a poultryman’s pie.  <br>  <br>  Grated carrot was the traditional farmer's wife's method of making meat go further without anyone realising, so I’ve included some to honour that tradition. You can omit it. However, if you need to make the meat go even further, add some more. <br>  <br>  Add 100g of chopped mushrooms to the meat. Sprinkle 50g of grated Cheddar cheese on top of the potato, or even into it as it being mashed. <br>  <br>  * New potatoes make rubbish mashed potato. Use old ones like King Edward’s or Desiree Reds.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	450g (1lb) Minced Lamb or Beef<br>  450-675g (1-1?lb) Mashed Potatoes<br>  285ml (? pint) Stock<br>  1 Onion<br>  1 Large Carrot (Optional)<br>  50g (2oz) Cheddar Cheese (Optional)<br>  Cornflour<br>  Salt and Black Pepper<br>  <br>  Pre-heat oven to 180°C: 350°F: Gas 4.<br>  Finely chop the onion and dice the carrot, if used.<br>  Fry minced meat until lightly coloured and remove from the pan and drain well.<br>  Add the onion and carrot, cooking gently until the onion is transparent and season to taste.<br>  Return the meat, add the stock.<br>  Add a little cornflour mixed with a few drops of water, stirring well.<br>  Bring to the boil and stir until thickened.<br>  Transfer the mixture into a casserole dish.<br>  Cover the mixture with an even layer of mashed potato.<br>  Cover and bake for 30 - 40 minutes.<br>  Uncover and sprinkle with grated cheese and bake for a further 15 minutes.<br>  Alternatively, bake for 30 - 60 minutes, remove from the oven and sprinkle with grated cheese and place under a very hot grill.|`|XCtjuhujaa	buy a microwavable one and say u cooked it ;)<br>  <br>  xXx Matt xXx|`|B3NfKQHJaa	SHEPHERD'S PIE  <br>  <br>  1 lb. ground beef<br>  1 onion, chopped<br>  1 (10 oz.) can tomatoes<br>  Salt and pepper<br>  1 (16 oz.) can mixed vegetables, drained<br>  4 med. potatoes, cooked and mashed<br>  3/4 c. cheddar cheese, grated<br>  <br>  Brown ground beef and onion.

Or does your mum or someone close to you have one?<br>  <br>  If the answer is yes, you can make a great French dish that's very easy to make (but she doesn't need to know that, does she?). It's a type of stew: Boeuf Bourguignon (Burgundy beef).<br>  <br>  It might be a tad expensive, though, because of the wine.<br>  <br>  It takes 30 minutes to make (about), and 40 minutes to cook.<br>  <br>  You need for 4 people (good thing is, it's delicious reheated; and you can freeze it):<br>  1 kg of beef (shoulder, chuck, anything for stews, really, but those two are good)<br>  100 g of bacon<br>  50 g of butter<br>  2 chopped onions<br>  1 bottle of red wine (if possible from Burgundy, but not compulsory)<br>  1 tablespoonful of tomato puree<br>  1 clove of garlic, chopped<br>  1 tablespoonful of flour<br>  1 bouquet garni (you can find it at Waitrose, I've just checked. They are mixed herbs in a bag, that you actually removed once it's cooked)<br>  salt<br>  pepper<br>  250 g of cup mushrooms <br>  chopped parsley<br>  <br>  Cut everything in advance, except the mushrooms and the parsley, which you can do while the meat is cooking.<br>  <br>  In the cooker, you brown the bacon (it means that you cook it at high temperature, but don't make it burn. Just use with a wooden spoon all the time) and then the beef cut into large cubes (about 3 cms) with the butter. Add the onions. Let everything glaze on a medium heat.<br>  <br>  Mix the flour in a glass of boiling water. Better if you put the flour in a glass, then add the boiling water. Otherwise, it won't mix well (but it wouldn't really be a problem, actually).<br>  <br>  Cover the meat, bacon and onion with the red wine. Add salt and pepper. Add the tomato purée, the bouquet garni and the garlic. Add the flour mixed with the water. Mix well and bring to a boil to remove the acidity of the wine.<br>  <br>  Close the cooker, turn up the temperature to the maximum. When the pressure regulator weight begins levitating on its nozzle, lower the temperature. If you have an electric stove, then move the cooker to another stove cos it might burn the meat. I have a stove than goes up to 3, and I put it on 1. Cook for 40 minutes.<br>  <br>  A bit before it's cooked, remove the "foot" of the mushrooms. Wash them and slice them thinly.. Sauté them with butter on high heat in a pan, then add them to the meat. Add the parsley.<br>  <br>  Serve with potatoes.|`|YQRDr3Lkaa	Shepherds Pie is an easy thing to make, which is good :)  There are many recipes on the web, but this is mine :)<br>  <br>  Peel and quarter about 4-6 potatoes and boil them in salted water for about 15-20 minutes until they are are soft in the middle (check with a sharp pointed knife).  Add a knob or butter, salt, pepper and a splash of milk or cream and mash to remove all lumps.  <br>  <br>  Finely dice an onion and fry in a sauce pan with some oil.  After the onion is soft and add about 400-500g minced lamb and brown the meat.  Add a stock cube and about half a pint of water, some nutmeg, thyme and a bay leaf or two if you have them and a teaspoon of tomato puree.  Add some finely diced carrots and some peas.  Leave to simmer on a medium heat for about 20 minutes until the sauce reduces into a thicker consistency.  If you have problem with your sauce being too runny, add a teaspoon of cornflour to the mix and stir well to thicken it.<br>  <br>  Allow the sauce to cool and place in a oven proof dish.  Spread the mash potato over the top of the sauce and even it out with a flat knife.  Add a little grated cheese if you like.<br>  <br>  This can all be prepared in advance and the whole dish can be popped in the fridge until you are ready to heat it up.<br>  <br>  Place in a preheated oven (around 200 Celsius) for about 20 minutes or until the topping is brown and the inside is heated through.  If you need to brown the top a bit more, turn off the oven after about 15 minutes and use the grill for the last 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

UeMz0uEBaa	Paula and Rachel Ray, I also love Guy!<br>  <br>  I love to watch DINERS, DRIVE-INS AND DIVES!!|`|wFw0SlJsaa	I love Rachel Ray's food.  It is stuff that anyone can realistically make  but with creative and fun twists so you don't have the same boring chicken and rice or take-out every night.  They are always inexpensive and well-balanced too. Yumm-o!|`|aIp8kKo5aa	I'd say PAULA plus she makes cooking fun because she has a cute personality that everyone loves<3|`|1dHTr3rkaa	Paula Dean|`|AA11561224	I believe it is Guy Fieri.

Her high tolerance for energy is a bit annoying, though.|`|78GfHPEKaa	Paula Dean...hands down|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Tyler Florence.|`|AA10625089	Paula Deen. She makes the down home comfort foods that we all love and grew up with, but Rachel Ray and Sandra Lee have simple and quick recipes for the time constrained.
WQRvAIvxaa	The holes are there for the same reason your grandma or mom pokes holes in a pie before baking. It allows steam to escape during baking. If they didn't do this the pie or crackers in this case would balloon up, and possibly pop making them ugly.|`|40920d469e8966c8b5b709122e72bc1faa	There are two explanations.<br>  <br>  1. It helps the cracker to cook evenly throughout.<br>  <br>  2. Leprechauns stick their wanks into the holes.|`|sKus5fXraa	No they are made for better cooking. <a href="http://recipe.thewikiz.com" rel="nofollow">http://recipe.thewikiz.com</a>|`|53giV6PFaa	They allow the steam in the cracker to escape so the cracker remains flat and not puffy.|`|s2gRgCZvaa	by placing all of those holes in the crackers it increases the surface area by a very significant amount. this increased surface area allows them to cook much more quickly than if there weren't any holes.
doz7RIoeaa	People seem to have assumed that your brother has bad eating habits. I thought people aren't supposed to be judgmental here? Maybe it's because of the fact that he eats meat that all the good manners and tolerance and non stereotyping goes out the window. <br>  <br>  What annoys your mother? The fact that she has to cook a different meal for each of you or that your brother does not want to eat vegetarian food?<br>  Since you are obviously older than your brother, how about eating ahead before you visit so your younger brother can have something to eat? After all, aren't older siblings supposed to give in to their younger ones?  I hate to think that a much older sister is competing for Mommy's attention and gets preference over her five year old brother when it comes to eating.|`|TBPzDU2vaa	I would let him sit until he ate all his food. Should that not work for a day or three .. take his plate from him, place instead a bowl of porridge (oats) with some honey!  Keep this up for several days .. with time you'll see the change in him.  Try not to worry too much ... with time he'll change his eating habits.|`|2RzEaod9aa	Wrong section, but it's time you teach your brother how to be a big boy. He just wants to be fed, it's not that he won't eat...you said so yourself. So you guys get to wait at the table and make him wait until his food is gone because he himself ate it.<br>  <br>  People need to stop spoiling children.|`|AA10625089	He's 5 years old and should not have to be fed. He's big boy. Put the food in front of him. If he does not want to eat don't force him, but make him sit there with the rest of the family. Dinner time is family time. He will eat if he is hungry. No dessert/snack until he eats. If he likes meat your mom should make sure that he has some meat even if it is some rolled up lunch meat for him to munch on.|`|Scupj6XVaa	he's a picky eater.  some children are like that.  my daughter is like that sometimes and i make her sit at the table until she eats it.  if you guys are done with dinner, leave him at the table alone.  maybe he wont like sitting there by himself and he will understand he is to eat when and what everyone else eats.|`|LVDd4Q1Jaa	So leave him there and tell him he can't get up until he's finished his plate.<br>  He'll eventually get tired/ hungry and eat.|`|Fyd0CaqTaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Why not try this as I did with my children when they give me a hard time with eating. I let them help me with the dinner, lunch, breakfast and even snack time. Not only they got to join in with the fun they got a lesson on what they where going to eat. You be amazing with all the questions they would ask. As they go along they would try something and comment on it that is a way for them to learn how things taste as well. Still today even though my kids are teenagers, each of them has one weekend to cook our family a 3 course meal ever month. They give the list of what they are going to doing on that weekend and I pick everything up with out any QUESTIONS! It is sometimes very interesting but, needless to day equal tasty.. Good luck! Hopes that helps you ….take care|`|vDawNdPzaa	Let him help cook dinner.  Tell him how well he did and maybe he will be proud enough of it to eat it.  It is a mistake to make him eat if he doesn't want to though, as that can cause problems later in life.  He doesn't need to learn "eat when everyone else eats even if you aren't hungry".  If he doesn't eat dinner, then he won't eat.  Maybe give him dinner (the same thing everyone else ate) afterwords. If he's hungry past seven though don't let him eat because that isn't good.  I would make him sit at the table though if that's where you all eat.|`|Tw0Ci97Yaa	ur mom needs to be strict on him. she has to let him know that vegtibles are healthy for him. make him learn about the food pyramid and tell him how much of what is good enough. to much meat is bad for him. to much or too little of anyting is bad. he is 5 and needs balanced meals. show him what happens to kids who dont eat their vegatibles. if he doesnt eat them he wont grow big and strong. also make sure that your mom is strict on him. she needs to tell him that he doesnt have to like it but he has to eat it, and that he cant leave the table until he finishes it. he wont eat it if he doesnt think she will make him. hope this helps. here are some helpful websites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://teamnutrition.usda.gov/Resources/mpk_poster2.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://teamnutrition.usda.gov/Resources/...</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps. if you evr need anyting you can email me smexyemolover15@yahoo.com|`|SEt1Znktaa	at that age kids would rather be playing then eating... give him a 1/2 a year to a year... he will eat everything he can.. same thing happened to my little brother

If it's not labeled then there's no way to be sure, but I've never heard of anyone rolling opium into a cigar.  <br>  <br>  It wouldn't make sense, because when you smoke opium it has to be inhaled, but when you smoke a cigar you don't inhale.|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	No opium in cigars. This is a new one to me.<br>  He'll be fine.|`|k6CSa9caaa	no opium in cigars. puff away!|`|j1UEbIr1aa	No cigars do not contain opium. Cuban cigars are made from tobacco originating from Cuba. The drug that is present in cigars is nicotine, which makes up 0.6–3.0% of dry weight of tobacco. Opium on the other hand is a narcotic which can only be formed from the sap of poppies, and is DEFINITELY not present in any tobacco products.|`|lrul1Yyjaa	if he purchased them from a cigar store in Cuba they should not contain any opium. tobacco products legally purchased are still bound by the same enforcing laws as in the US.|`|6Qv1CEmqaa	they do not contain opium, just remind him a cigar is not for inhaling.

Also another good finger food is small aubergine sliced length ways, fried in a pan and rolled around mozzarella and secured with a toothpick.  I'd also include hot or cold meats like baked ham.  You could also do a big plate of tri-colour salad - grilled halloumi, tomatoes, red onion cut into rings, sprinkle with basil leaves and drizzle a bit of olive oil on top.  Good luck!  Hope the above helps!|`|4KtPFzz5aa	These are just a few random suggestions: <br>  Mushroom Caps Stuffed With Smoked Salmon<br>  Bread Bowl with Spinach Dip & Crackers?<br>  Asparagus Spears with Raspberry Vinaigrette <br>  Fresh Seasonal Fruit Tray<br>  Brie en Croute <br>  <br>  You're kind of stuck between holidays, too late for St. Patrick's Day & too early for Easter.  You could do a state theme, selecting foods for which your state is well known.  Or, you could do an ethnic theme, such as Jamaican.  Or seafood.  The possibilities are endless.  Aim for visual appeal, using foods with different colors & textures.<br>  I love Jamaican food, so I would use Chilled Jerk Chicken on Fried Plantain Chips with Tomato Chutney.<br>  You could also do an "Around the World" theme, complete with decor.  Have a flag of each country represented next to each dish.<br>  Or, you could do a Paris In Spring theme, using Parisian appetizers.

cCEpmL69aa	They're less dangerous as in, you'll get less tar and less nicotine, but there's still enough tar and nicotine in them to give you cancer, so although technically it's better you can still get cancer just as easily as smoking anything else.<br>  <br>  Also a friend of mine got 10 silk cut silvers because he had nothing else, hadnt smoked for a day and had a craving which would normally for him be fixed after 2 mayfairs or something... and he had to smoke the whole pack to feel like he'd had anything. so really it ends up just as bad :p|`|TAIlyvgyaa	Nope.

02fdd30cf9904e853e7fdbac52f61769aa	Cook your chicken. It will be fine. Most people commonly thaw their chicken and other meats the same way you did yours. As long as you don't leave the meat sitting out for ungodly amounts of time, (over 12 hours) then the cooking process should kill all germs. While you hear people all the time refer to the 'safe handling instructions', they rarely follow them. You need to be more concerned about sanitary conditions and clean up, then you are about how you thawed the meat.|`|53giV6PFaa	I hate to see food go to waste,  I would just throw it out to be on the safe side.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Big_Thaw/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.fsis.usda.gov/fact_sheets/Big...</a><br>  <br>  Food must be kept at a safe temperature during "the big thaw." Foods are safe indefinitely while frozen. However, as soon as food begins to defrost and become warmer than 40 °F, any bacteria that may have been present before freezing can begin to multiply.<br>  <br>  Foods should never be thawed or even stored on the counter, or defrosted in hot water. Food left above 40 °F (unrefrigerated) is not at a safe temperature.<br>  <br>  Even though the center of the package may still be frozen as it thaws on the counter, the outer layer of the food is in the "Danger Zone," between 40 and 140 °F – at temperatures where bacteria multiply rapidly.<br>  <br>  Bacteria grow most rapidly in the range of temperatures between 40 and 140 °F, some doubling in number in as little as 20 minutes. Some types will produce toxins that are not destroyed by cooking. <br>  <br>  BTW - cool to the touch means that the chicken is above 40 °F.|`|0eaFftjyaa	i would say it depends on the marinade. You mention the marinade is completely covering the chicken, if it is a lemon marinade or something similar or contains a high amount of salt then i would say it will be fine to eat as the acidity will kill bacteria, i would keep it in the fridge in future just to be on the safe side, but the chicken will be good to eat.|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	Personally I would dump it. <br>  <br>  You can cook it - WELL WELL WELL DONE and you should be fine.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Lately, everyone is nuts over chicken germs or whatever it is that everyone is panicing about.  If  the bird was still cool, the germs/cooties/bugs/micro-badies/whatever cannot live.  So cook the bird.  And to be on those other peoples good side, cook in a bit longer and don't give them any.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Technically no. But I would use it anyway, especially if it was still cool.  Just be sure to cook it to 165 F, which you should be doing anyways!

Bake in a 350 degrees Fahrenheit oven for one hour and 15 minutes, basting occasionally with ketchup or your favorite barbecue sauce.<br>  <br>  <br>  Optional Variations:<br>  <br>  Choose one:<br>  1. Eliminate salt, bouillon, and substitute 3 tablespoon onion soup mix. Sprinkle top with tomato soup and crushed crackers instead.<br>  <br>  2. Use old-fashioned rolled oats instead of bread crumbs.<br>  <br>  3. If you have leftover bread, especially Italian or French bread, substitute milk for the water listed in recipe, and soak about 2 cups bread in the milk prior to mixing into the meat mixture. Squeeze out the excess slightly before adding. Substitute this bread for the bread crumbs. After mixing everything together, you can also form this meat mixture into meatballs and fry in 1/2 inch olive oil in a heavy bottom skillet (such as cast iron). If making Italian meatballs, leave out the brown sugar and Dijon mustard, but be sure to use the Parmesan cheese. Season the oil in the pan with 2-3 whole cloves garlic (don't chop it up or it will burn instead of just roasting).<br>  <br>  4. If you're in a hurry, you may use as a substitute 2 cups of barbecue sauce and eliminate the following ingredients:<br>  <br>  <br>  1 c. ketchup<br>  1 8 oz can tomato sauce<br>  3 tbsp. balsamic vinegar<br>  3 tbsp. of brown sugar<br>  2 tbsp. Dijon mustard<br>  2 tsp. Worcestershire sauce<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Eliminate the sauté crumbs. Sauté this mixture with onion and garlic for 5 minutes and layer a casserole with no-cook lasagna noodles. Place meat mixture to cover noodles. Add a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and:<br>  <br>  1/3 pound ricotta mixed with one egg<br>  1/4 c. freshly chopped Italian parsley or 1 c. fresh spinach<br>  1/2 pound grated mozzarella cheese<br>  <br>  <br>  Cover with another layer of noodles, and top with 1 large can of tomato sauce mixed with 1/2 teaspoon each basil and oregano. Place in 325 degree oven 60 minutes or until bubbly, basting occasionally with sauce to prevent lasagna from drying out.<br>  6. Form meat mixture into large doughnut shapes, approximately 6-7 inches across. When forming the doughnut, don't allow the center to actually become a doughnut hole; just thin it out, leaving a well in the center. Optionally, brush with ketchup. Crush 8-10 Saltine or Ritz crackers into crumbs and sprinkle over the doughnut shaped burger, concentrating the excess crumbs into the center. Sprinkle with onion and garlic powder and a liberal dose of soy sauce, allowing a 1/2 spoon or so to form in the well. This can optionally be topped with cheese and canned mushrooms if desired. Place in microwave and cook on high for 3 minutes or so, according to size, until the juices run clear and meat doughnut is done. Served with meat drippings as topping, there is no need for a bun. This is a fast and easy low-carb lunch!<br>  <br>  7. Place 3-4 strips of bacon lengthwise along the top of the meatloaf. Garnish with rings of green or red bell pepper and bake as usual. 8. Use your imagination, get creative, and enjoy!|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Cajun-Seasoned Meatloaf<br>  <br>  1 to 1 1/2 pounds lean ground beef<br>  1/2 pound ground pork or more beef<br>  1 large egg<br>  1/3 cup finely ground bread crumbs<br>  1 medium tomato, seeds removed, cored, finely chopped<br>  1/4 cup onion, finely chopped<br>  1/4 cup red bell pepper, finely chopped<br>  1/4 cup celery, finely chopped<br>  1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons Cajun or Creole seasoning mixture<br>  1/2 teaspoon salt<br>  dash pepper<br>  2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce<br>  ketchup or chili sauce, optional<br>  PREPARATION:<br>  Combine all ingredients except ketchup or chili sauce; pack into a loaf pan or meatloaf pan, or shape into a loaf shape and set on a rack or crumpled foil on a shallow baking sheet.

IKXFAExJaa	You have a lot to make plenty of stuff besides cream of broccoli soup, but still, if you want to make a really nice, professional style version, try this out:<br>  <br>  Makes 8 servings<br>  Two pounds fresh broccoli<br>  One-quarter cup olive or vegetable oil<br>  One medium onion, chopped (about 1 and one-quarter cup)<br>  One celery stalk, chopped (about one-half cup)<br>  One leek, white and light green parts, chopped (about 1 and one-quarter cup)<br>  One-quarter cup all-purpose flour<br>  One and one-half quarts chicken broth<br>  One-half cup heavy cream, heated<br>  Fresh lemon juice, to taste<br>  Salt, to taste<br>  Freshly ground black pepper, to taste<br>  <br>  Separate broccoli into stems and florets. Trim away tough outer parts of stems. Set aside 1 cup of small florets for garnish. Coarsely chop remaining florets and stems.<br>  <br>  Heat oil in a soup pot over medium heat. Add onion, celery, leek, and chopped broccoli. Cook -- stirring frequently -- until onion is translucent, 6-8 minutes.<br>  <br>  Add flour and stir well to combine. Cook, stirring frequently, 4 minutes.<br>  Add broth to pot gradually, whisking to work out any lumps of flour. Bring soup to a simmer and cook, 45 minutes. Stir frequently and skim as needed.<br>  <br>  Strain solids, reserving liquid. Puree the solids, adding liquid as necessary to facilitate pureeing.<br>  <br>  Combine puree with enough reserved liquid to achieve the consistency of heavy cream. Strain soup through a fine sieve (optional). Return soup to a simmer.<br>  Meanwhile, steam or boil reserved broccoli florets until just tender.<br>  <br>  Remove soup from heat and add heated cream. Season with lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Serve in heated bowls, garnished with florets.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to really get down to basics, just boil the broccoli crowns in salted, boiling water until just tender. Blitz in a blender with just enough of the cooking liquid to liquefy the whole batch. Season with salt and pepper and serve. It's super bright green and tastes just a bowl-o-broccoli. Serve with chevre (goat's cheese) and walnuts for a more elegant presentation.

f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	Well, there really is no "proper" way to fix tofu. It all depends on your personal preference and what you want to do with it. <br>  <br>  For stir-frying, a lot of folks either pan sear, fry or bake their tofu. Here's the way I prepared mine:<br>  - Use one block of extra-firm tofu. Take it out of the package and place it between two plates. <br>  - Set the tofu (and plates) in the kitchen sink and place a heavy can on top of the top plate to press out the excess water. <br>  - Allow the tofu to sit like that for the better half of a day; periodically take the top can off and gently tip the tofu to the side and drain off the water that has been pressed out. <br>  - Once the tofu is drier, wrap in a paper towel to further wick away moisture. Let it soak up the fluid for about an hour.<br>  - Prepare your marinate in a decent, sized bowl and then place the tofu in the mixture. <br>  - Cover the tofu and place it in the refrigerator for a few hours. I usually would allow it to sit over night. <br>  - When you're ready to use it, take the block out of the marinade and chop it into whatever shape you desire (cubes, strips, steaks, etc.). <br>  - In a medium saucepan, use about 1 tbspn olive or vegetable oil in the pan. Turn the eye on to medium and allow the oil to heat up. Once it's heated, gently place the tofu in the pan and allow it to sear on both sides. If you want it extra crispy, allow it to cook longer. If not, gently turn it over and brown the other side. Take off the heat once it's done lay it on a paper towel to drain. <br>  <br>  I hope that gives you a different idea about it. Good luck!|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	you have to drain the water off. put the tofu on a kitchen towel, place another towel on top of it, and place a weight on top of that like a baking dish. let it sit for an hour or so. some people freeze the tofu, then thaw it before draining the water off of it. it changes the structure of it somehow improving the texture. You can also marinade it to help with the flavor.

pbPTJzKiaa	OMG!!!  You can use a computer.  You can spell, for the most part.  You are attempting to make a cake, but you can't read the side of the measuring cup.  It is the little container with fractions on the side.  You understand quarters and halves?  Imagine, in your juvenile mind, the container in three parts.  These are called thirds.  Three parts make one when put together.  Are you still with me?  Somewhere in life someone thought you should skip the basics and move right on to the advanced stuff.  Someone suggested you read the instructions on the box.  Yea, right.  Have your mommy mix everything together and pour it in the pan.  Then, if you behave, you can lick the spoon and watch the cake cook through the little window on the oven.  Now make sure you wash your hands and eat all your dinner so you can enjoy some of your delicious cake.  Good luck in life.|`|nOVSf06Raa	you just need to follow the recipe and pour the batter in don't worry about the level that the cake pan is filled as long that you are using the right measurement required if for example you are making a Bundt Cake use a Bundt mold and so on if you are making layer cakes these come in graduated sizes as long that you leave a space allowance for the rising you have nothing to worry about.|`|U5N0iPfLaa	About 2/3 full.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	if you know what 3 quarters full is, then what dont you understand about 3rds.  instead of imagining your cake pan divided into 4 parts, just imagine 3 parts. and fill 2/3. if you still get it, then just fill it to 3/4 or more than half way.|`|xHvnGjCKaa	You don't have to be so accurate.

Whist a few eggs together with either milk or water (I prefer water) and put them into a buttered measuring cup. Micro on high for one minute at a time. I would love to tell you how many minutes but that depends upon the type of measuring cup or bowl lthat you are using and the size of the micro itself. (that is the thing about microwaving it is not a science....there are variables)<br>  When the eggs have puffed up and pull away from the sides they are ready. Be very careful taking them out...the inside could have filled with air and could explode|`|vM5kqdoCaa	I cook mine for three to four minutes, or until your eggs are good and fluffy.

When they still look a little wet I take them out because the carry over heat will continue to cook them. If you cook them until they look dry they will be overcooked.<br>  <br>  I've also just let them cook without stirring until they poof up and the egg starts to pull away from the bowl.

Serve at once. <br>  Hard-boiled eggs should remain in the water for 20 minutes. <br>  [edit]Poached Eggs<br>  Bring water to a boil in a saucepan with a pinch of salt for flavor. <br>  Lower the heat to slightly simmering and break eggs, one at a time, gently placing them into the saucepan. <br>  When the egg white is set, lift out on a perforated spoon and place on toast, or on a warm dish, and serve. <br>  [edit]Scrambled Eggs<br>  Break 2 eggs into a bowl. <br>  Add 1 tablespoon milk and beat only slightly. <br>  Heat an oiled frying pan and add the eggs and a sprinkle of salt. <br>  Scrape the bottom of the pan continuously with a spoon until the mixture is soft and jellied. <br>  Remove the eggs from the heat when they are a bit softer than desired. They will continue to cook and harden after being removed from the heat. <br>  [edit]Scrambled Eggs with New Tomato<br>  Scald and peel 2 medium sized ripe tomatoes. Cut into quarters and place in a small covered saucepan. <br>  Add a pinch of salt and bring to a boil. <br>  Pour the tomatoes into a colander and drain off the juice. <br>  Add 1 teaspoon vegetable butter and reheat. <br>  Heat a greased skiller and break in 2 eggs. <br>  Stir quickly so they cook evenly. <br>  When they are soft cooked, add the tomatoes. <br>  Mix lightly, and serve on toast. <br>  [edit]Steamed Eggs<br>  In a hot, greased skillet, break in 3 eggs and sprinkle 3 tablespoons of water over them. <br>  Sprinkle lightly with salt and cover. <br>  Cook over a medium heat until white on top and soft. <br>  Remove and serve immediately. <br>  [edit]Jellied or Coddled Egg<br>  Bring 1 pint of water to a boil in a small saucepan. <br>  Drop 1 egg into the water with a spoon and remove from heat. Let sit for 7 minutes. <br>  Remove the egg from the water and serve. <br>  If more eggs are added, the water must be increased in proportion. Likewise, if the saucepan is wide-mouthed or broad, there must be more than enough boiling water to cover the eggs. The rule is a pint to an egg in a deep utensil. <br>  [edit]Plain Omelet<br>  Beat 2 eggs slightly and add 1 tablespoon milk and a sprinkle of salt. <br>  Heat 2 teaspoons of vegetable butter in a frying pan. <br>  Add the eggs and keep them continuously in motion by shaking the pan or stirring as for scrambled egg. <br>  When the mass is soft cooked, let rest on the heat as you pick up one side with a spoon or a fork, fold over to the other side, and place on a hot platter. <br>  Serve immediately. <br>  [edit]Omelet Puff<br>  Beat 1 egg york until thick. <br>  Beat together 1 tablespoon milk and egg yolk. <br>  Add a few grains of salt to the white and beat until stiff. <br>  Fold the yolk mixture into the white and palce in a hot, greased frying pan. <br>  Place in the oven and bake until barely set. <br>  Then, while it is still in the pan, slip a knife under one side and turn it over the other section. <br>  Invert on a hot platter and serve at once. <br>  [edit]Bread Omelet<br>  Make the same as omelet puff but add 1/4 cup fresh bread crumbs, moistened with enough cold milk to soften. <br>  Add the softened crumbs to the beaten yolk and fold into the beaten white. <br>  Bake the same as omelet puff. <br>  [edit]|`|qWuYaW6Paa	the short answer is fried, scrambled, poached and in an omlette.<br>  <br>  if your frying get the pan up to a decent heat before hand and flip the egg when the white is cooked.<br>  <br>   scrambled. beat a couple of eggs together with salt and pepper, dump them in the pan and scrape the cooked eggs off the bottom of the pan every minute or so. goes great with smoked salmon.<br>  <br>  poached.  by far the tastiest. fill a pan half full with water and a tablespoon of malt vinegar. bring to the boil and reduce to a simmer. take an eating knife and swirl in a circle in the centre of the pan  until a mini vortex is created. break the egg into the middle. the vortex means the egg keeps its shape. simmer for 4 minutes and serve on buttered toast with bacon.<br>  <br>  most importantly of all whenever cooking eggs never let the yolk go solid|`|U5N0iPfLaa	One of the base ingredients in hundreds of thousands of recipes.

ZIPLOC OMELET <br>  <br>  (This works great! Good for when all your family is together. The best part is that no one has to wait for their special omelet).<br>  <br>  Have each person write their name on a Quart-size Ziploc freezer bag with permanent marker.<br>  Crack 2 eggs (large or extra-large) into the bag (not more than 2) shake to combine them.<br>  Put out a variety of ingredients such as: cheeses, ham, onion, green pepper, tomato, salsa, etc.<br>  Each person adds prepared ingredients of choice to their bag and shake. Make sure to get the air out of the bag and zip it up.<br>  <br>  Place the bags into rolling, boiling water for exactly 13 minutes. You can usually cook 6-8 omelets in a large pot. For more, make another pot of boiling water.<br>  Open the bags and the omelet will roll out easily. Be prepared for everyone to be amazed.<br>  Nice to serve with fresh fruit and coffee cake; everyone gets involved in the process and a great conversation piece.<br>  <br>  Note: This is easy and very good. Just ask her what she wants in her omlet and go from there.

They are not the same chemical, but you can substitute one for another in recipes. Here's how:<br>  <br>  Using Baking Powder Instead of Baking Soda<br>  <br>      * You need to use 2-3 times more baking powder than baking soda. The extra ingredients in the baking powder will have an effect on the taste of whatever you are making, but this isn't necessarily bad.<br>  <br>      * Ideally, triple the amount of baking soda to equal the amount of baking powder. So, if the recipe called for 1 tsp baking soda, you would use 3 tsp baking powder.<br>  <br>      * What I do is compromise... I use twice the amount of baking powder as baking soda (add 2 tsp of baking powder if the recipe calls for 1 tdp baking soda), plus I omit the salt (which adds flavor but also affects rising in some recipes).|`|vvJBtxXHaa	Meli is absolutly correct in her assessment of of what I (IMHO) will  refer to as "the only viable alternative to the real ingredients:"<br>  <br>  1/4 teaspoon of baking soda<br>  1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar|`|2qbLrHBKaa	No, absolutely not|`|cJwve90Gaa	You would then have a "bitter" cake!     NO....|`|MbW8KRoGaa	No--baking powder is actually baking soda + tartaric acid (cream of tartar). So baking soda is an ingredient in baking powder, not a substitution. If there are acidic ingredients in your cake recipe, like buttermilk, yogurt, or lemon juice and you use baking powder, you'll get a massive rise and your cake will most likely leave the cake pan!|`|6SqxGQsqaa	YES you can. BUT you have to alter the baking powder to have the same ph level as the baking powder.  baking soda us 4 times stronger than baking powder.  for each teaspoon of baking powder required use this:<br>  <br>  1/4 teaspoon of baking soda<br>  1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar|`|xHvnGjCKaa	No their 2 different ingredients

Prepare the pudding while the roast is resting.<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.<br>  <br>  Leave 2 tablespoons of drippings in the roasting pan and place in the oven.<br>  <br>  Place the flour, salt, eggs, milk and remaining 2 tablespoons of drippings into the bowl of a food processor or blender and process for 30 seconds. Pour the batter into the hot roasting pan and bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until puffed and golden brown. While the pudding is cooking, carve the roast. Serve the pudding with the roast. <br>  <br>  It's simple, but it works. Hope this helps.
IKXFAExJaa	Almost any soup can be stored, frozen and reheated without a problem. In general though, you don't want to heat soups with pasta in them for extended periods of time or else the pasta will continue to absorb liquid and become big and mushy.<br>  <br>  Just re-heat the soup before you want to serve it and add the pasta then (either cooking IN the soup or pre-cooking then adding it).<br>  <br>  Just for the record, there are very few things that need to served immediately after cooking (with the exception of things that are fried, which will get soggy and whatnot if they sit for too long).|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|d19faee87d87426beb4d19828a1ffbdaaa	It's definitely re-heatable. Most soups are even better the second day, after all of the flavors have been released and blended together.<br>  Just try to heat it as quickly as possible so that your pasta doesn't become overcooked.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Minestrone is certainly reheatable. Just be careful not to simmer the soup too long because there are so many vegetables you don't want to overcook- I'd say 30 minutes simmering is plenty<br>  <br>  *If you are wanting to ad pasta to your soup just know that it will soak up more liquid when sitting and the pasta will swell up and not be aldente. <br>  A trick I use to avoid that is I put the pasta in a metal strainer on top of the boiling soup so the pasta is separate from the soup but cooking in the flavored broth. When the pasta is done, drain and let cool a bit then save in a ziplock bag with a few drops of broth (so it doesn't dry out) and add it to your soup bowl individually when you reheat|`|53giV6PFaa	You can go ahead and make it in advance, just leave the pasta out.  About 20 minutes or so before serving, bring the soup to a boil then turn down the heat to a simmer.  Add pasta and simmer for 10 minutes or until pasta is cooked.  That way the pasta doesn't get mushy by sitting in the soup all day. <br>  <br>  That is what I would do, because I do not like mushy pasta.|`|4ec5baf736e5e1b4200f6e39ea8eda12aa	You can serve it the day after if your like just make sure you stir it during the reheating process to avoid the pasta sticking to the bottom of the saucepan.|`|dRiBGoJkaa	Just use your common sense, food is perishable.  If you make it the day before it would be fine to reheat, as long as its stored correctly before use and thoroughly warmed through when you reheat it.

xrRZeROmaa	The corn meal doesn't stick as well as the wheat flour.  No gluten.  You can dust your chicken with corn meal and pan fry until crispy, and it will add crunchy corn taste.  In addition, you could as already suggested use half and half with flour, and bound breading method.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest using corn flour instead, or masa flour, mixed half and half with wheat flour, and seasoned with salt, pepper, oregano, paprika, garlic powder, and any other spices you prefer.  <br>  <br>  Dip your chicken into the breading mix, then into an egg wash, or buttermilk, and then back into the breading mix.  Knock off any excess breading, and set the pieces aside , covered with a damp towel, until the outside of the breading is sticky to the touch.<br>  <br>  Deep fry, or pan fry, until golden brown, turning several times if in the pan.  Store cooked pieces in a 200 F oven, on paper towels or a draining rack with a pan of water under it, while cooking remaining  pieces.  Can be stored for up to two hours at 200 degrees F.  while preparing the rest of the meal.<br>  <br>  This will give you a crispy coating, more crunchy than flour alone.|`|d62310b3e25bb263db275c523c9cfe86aa	yes, it just has a little different texture. The best to use it, is to add just a little flour to the cornmeal, along with any seasonings you like.<br>  Dip your chicken in egg, then in the cornmeal. (some ppl dip in flour first, then egg, then cornmeal-- it works either way)<br>  Fry at a medium heat. I find that the cornmeal gets crunchier and coats/stays on better than flour. It does have a different texture and taste, but not like corndogs (unless you make it a batter)|`|jij9Fa9waa	i use a mixture of both, little flour and smidge of cornmeal, then I use the cajun season mix, lay that to it a little, and yehaw, that will make some mighty fine chickon...ma cherie.<br>  I like to fry my chicken slow, to get it done good, then right before I take it from the skillet, I will fire it up and put the crisp to it.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I guess so, but the batter will taste like corn dog.
tfkpNh89aa	Good day country Joe...<br>  <br>  Your cousin needs to create a business plan and mission statement for the restaurant.<br>  <br>  * Look around the area and see what places are doing well and with what food.<br>  <br>  * Have something "special" about the restaurant that no-one has or is doing - like a signature dish.<br>  <br>  * Create the entire menu and recipes.<br>  <br>  * Check out food costs through the wholesale distribution companies<br>  <br>  * Create recipes, figure out food cost, consider "waste"<br>  <br>  * Figure out expenses,rent, electric, gas, water, payroll, grease trap removal and cleaning, basic maintenance on kitchen and front of the house.<br>  <br>  * Figure out collateral and loan<br>  <br>  * So, asking this question here is not going to really help, and the last thing you want is a copy and paste of a recipe.<br>  <br>  Once you've covered those bases, well then you will be a good point, but you need to stay focused.  <br>  <br>  It's one thing knowing how to cook, it's another thing in running a restaurant.  And remember 90% of all new restaurants if unsuccessful will shut down within 12-14 months. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your cousin.  I wish you the best.|`|AA12148745	Sounds to me like you and your cousin are failures waiting to happen. You don't just pick a menu. You have to target your market and have a business plan and an original concept. Since you don't even know how to spell burritos and have no clue how to make them, I seriously doubt you would succeed in catering to the Latino communities.|`|ykeI3OqSaa	uhhh yall don't sound that prepared for the mexican stuff if you dont know how to cook a burrito.  Maybe you should just specialize in the american food!  How about having rootbeer floats or something like that to go with the burgers?  Or milkshakes?  You could have more stuff like fried pickles or jalepeno poppers and cheese sticks.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	How about some low carb plates or entrees? I go to places where one of the options is Chef Salads with low carb count or fruit/meat salads.

A more concentrated brew will have more caffeine.   Flavor intensity is a combination of 1) and 2), but brewing a concentrated cup of a dark roast can produce an unpleasant burnt flavor.

Huq5yecjaa	If you mean the recipe blend that exists called 'Earl Grey' then it originated in China, or so the legend goes. Apparently Earl Grey was given the recipe for saving a chinese boy from drowning - emphasis on the word apparently. Since this legend is in doubt :P<br>  <br>  The tea itself can be produced from most places, since it's black tea and the rind of a citrus fruit which can be grown in most warm, wet climates.

5b2f5bafb673883a460f964b96799d1daa	Da,<br>  Use Bertolli if you can get it.  It is expensive - in the USA it tends to be 3-5 dollars per 500 ml and it has a golden yellow color.  Only buy extra virgin - here, 'virgin' this refers to the number of times the olives have been pressed before.  Extra virgin = zero.  Hope this helps!|`|NPeOpOfuaa	I find that Bertolli is the best brand. The colour differs because some olive oil is made of black, and some of white olives. It also depends on the quality and whether it is virgin, extra virgin ect.|`|AA12198711	Tasting<br>  <br>  Because no two batches of olive oil are ever the same, tasting is important. Inferior oil may ruin the flavor of food, but good oil will enhance the flavors without overpowering the food. It is always best to taste olive oil first before it is used in cooking or in salads to ensure that the flavor is pleasing and it will work for the specific dishes.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The criteria for judging olive oil are based on the aroma and the taste. The color of the olive oil is of little importance to the overall quality of the oil.<br>  <br>  <br>  Aroma  The alcohol, ketones, esters, and hydrocarbons present in the oil determine the aroma. Processing and storage methods also have an affect on the aroma.<br>  Taste  The taste of the olive oil is judged by its positive and negative taste characteristics and by its saltiness, acidity, bitterness, sharpness, and/or sweetness.<br>  Colour  The color of olive oil is not necessarily used as criteria for quality. The color allows the judge to determine the age of the olives at harvest time. Young olives produce green colored oil and more mature olives produce a yellow color. Olive oil takes on a red tint as it oxidizes.Judges are often blindfolded when tasting olive oil so the color is not known until after the tasting. An experienced judge may be able to determine the color based on the aroma and flavor characteristics of the oil.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The table below lists some of the flavors and characteristics that are considered to be desirable or undesirable as judged by experts in olive oil tasting.<br>  <br>   <br>  Positive Characteristics<br>   <br>  Negative Characteristics<br>  Apple - a hint of apple flavor can be very desirable.  Bitter - although a subtle bitterness is considered desirable, a strong bitter flavor is a negative trait.<br>  Almond - subtle, nutty flavor, common in Spanish olive oils.  Briny - a briny, salty flavor indicates the oil was produced from brined olives.<br>  Artichoke - similar to an artichoke flavor.  Burnt - an undesirable flavor caused by an unacceptably high temperature during processing.<br>  Astringent - the oil creates a puckering sensation in the mouth, which if not overpowering is considered to be a positive attribute.  Dirty - this characteristic refers to oil that has remained in contact with the vegetable water, which was separated during pressing. The oil absorbs unpleasant flavors from the water.<br>  Bitter - a bitterness that is very subtle is desirable.  Earthy - musty and humid flavor and aroma.<br>  Buttery - smooth, sweet, rich flavor.  Flat - refers to olive oil that has lost most of its flavor and aroma.<br>  Fresh - clean and crisp.  Greasy - olive oil that has a petroleum flavor.<br>  Fruity - similar flavor and aroma as a ripe olive. Most olive oils are fruity after pressing, but may soon change in flavor and aroma. Oil that is classified as fruity does not lose this characteristic.  Musty - an unpleasant, moldy flavor that occurs in olive oil if the olives were stored too long before pressing.<br>  Green - a young oil with a fresh, fruity or weedy aroma and flavor.  Metallic - olive oil may absorb a metallic flavor from reactive metals, either during pressing or when stored. Reactive metals should not be used for the production or storage of olive oil.<br>  Melon - a slight melon flavored aftertaste.  Moldy - a pronounced moldy flavor caused by fermentation of olives that have been stored too long before pressing.<br>  Musky - If not too strong, it can be very desirable.  Rancid - a bad flavor caused by the oxidation of the olive oil because of exposure to air and/or light.<br>  Peppery - a distinct peppery flavor that is common in many Italian olive oils.  Rough - a pasty and greasy feel in the mouth.<br>  Sweet - subtle, mildly sweet flavor found in mellow oils. Many French oils have this quality.  Wine - olive oil that has a very acidic flavor.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Olive oil is tough; the best olive oils are very expensive cold pressed varieties from Spain and Italy. Supermarket brands aren't as good, but you do get what you pay for. This seems to be a case of "more expensive is better." For every day use though, I use Bertolli. <br>  <br>  According to Cooks Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen, the best supermarket olive oil is Columela Extra Virgin Olive Oil. Bertolli and Filippo are recommended budget brands. <br>  <br>  Another note about color or variety; Extra Virgin. That's all you should ever buy, regardless of application. It will be easier for you to buy, and it will do everything you want it too. DO NOT buy light, or virgin or any other kind... Extra Virgin only. It's that simple.

Use toothpicks or skewers to hold it closed. Olive oil and season the outside then bake at 350 for 20-25 minutes.<br>  <br>  If Pancetta, Asparagus spears and Feta aren't to you liking then try small Broccoli florets, cheddar, and bacon with your favorite seasoning.<br>  <br>  Hope you enjoy.
wjEPVNezaa	Pesca-Pollo Vegetarian.<br>  <br>  What's wrong with modifiers to words?  That's what they do, take a regular word and make it so that the meaning is very clear.

But they would not be called vegetarians.  If ya give up the animals and animal goo,  vegan is a whole lot easier to remember and spell!|`|2elAmfGPaa	kinda like a half-vegetarian diet. there's not really a name i can think of seeing that it's not really a real diet because ur still eating meat ur just cutting back from pork and beef<br>  pork and beef are gross, so i agree with ur decision not to eat it :P|`|6768c11da3a7523681b339d4d16ff8b6aa	Just say you don't eat red meat. Many people believe that pork, beef, lamb, etc. contain too much unhealthy fat. You don't really have to label yourself to enjoy any culinary lifestyle.|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Nope. You're just a regular ol' omnivore.|`|GZtdISjNaa	No. There are no half measures|`|F3LBgfvwaa	yeah, the name is:<br>  <br>  a person who eats chicken and fish but not pork or beef|`|AA12334360	I don't think there is one, its a type of diet, just like everyone elses.<br>  <br>  It would be like me asking of there was a name for someone that excludes brocolli from thier diet,<br>  <br>  We'd end up with millions of definitions !<br>  <br>  PLEASE ignore the pesco-vegetarian or demi-vegetarian answer. That really is nonsense. Ask any vegetarian group what they think of those prefixes to the word vegetarian. but duck while you wait for thier answer.....<br>  <br>  To prefix a word with a modifier when that word has a definative definition is quite ridculous.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	Omnivore.  If you eat any meat then you are an omnivore.  If you've cut out red meats that's great for your health.<br>  <br>  Vegetarian comes from the root words vegetation (as in plant life) and terra (of the earth)  So a vegetarian is one whose diet consists of food grown from the earth.  Many vegetarians are actually lacto-ovo vegetarians, meaning that in addition to plants they include dairy and eggs.  Some people who don't eat red mead use the phrases pescaterian (fish) or polloterian (poultry)  Since these break down to fish/chicken of the earth I don't see that they make sense.|`|2RzEaod9aa	It's called "I only eat chicken and fish." Do you seriously need a label for every little thing? Being a vegetarian, vegan, diabetic, Jew/Muslim, etc., means that you have a restricted diet. You're just being picky...so that's the name for it if you want it to be. <br>  <br>  P.S. It's not referred to as "dark meat" but as "red meat," and pork is actually not a red meat...it's a white meat, like chicken.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	It really shouldnt need a label - there are lots of people who cut out just one food.  Wheat, or sugar, or dairy, or salt, or chocolate.  I don't know why cutting out just red meat should need a name.<br>  However because so many people did and still do keep calling themselves vegetarian because theyd just cut out red meat, the terms Pollotarian, Pescatarian and Pollo-pescatarian were invented.  Pollo means poultry, pesca is fish.  So you would be pollo-pescatarian.  But I wouldnt use the term if I were you.|`|2zHq2XIMaa	It is, just that; you do not eat pork or beef. It is not complicated enough to warrant a label. Just explain to people that you don't eat pork or beef, and give them your reasons. You are an omnivore, if you are to be put into a category.<br>   I hope that my answer helped clear things up.

QWY0P98Haa	Happy 21st Birthday.<br>  <br>  What ever you drink tomorrow  is going to make you tipsy. And where ever you go your bartender should be able to make a yummy suggestion. I would suggest you drink something like a Sex on the Beach. It is fruity and you really don't taste the alcohol much. I would not suggest that you drink a little of  ''everything'' as some have said. Mixing different types of alcohols can make you really sick. I don't think you would be having a good time while throwing up all over the place.<br>  <br>  I do have some tips for you..<br>  Eat  a good meal before you go out. Drinking on an empty stomach is a recipe for disaster.<br>  Drink water before, during and after drinking alcohol. Your liver needs that water to process the alcohol. If there is a water shortage in your body, your liver takes it from other organs, including your brain (causing that hangover headache)<br>  <br>  But most of all enjoy your day! you only get to turn 21 once!!|`|dDbriFvsaa	Try a little of everything.

KSK22vHUaa	How are potatoes unhealthy?<br>  <br>  If you want something like a potato chip that's not fried, try baked chips or pita chips or vegetable chips.  But that's more of a move away from fried food than from potatoes in general.<br>  <br>  Is it the carbohydrate count?  Eat meat instead.<br>  <br>  Is it the starch?  Eat a salad instead.<br>  <br>  But potatoes overall are pretty healthy and a good thing to keep in your diet.

It's anything with any of these by-products. I am not vegan but my good friend is, and you would be surprised the stuff she cannot eat. You might look at a cracker and think oh it's just a cracker- that's not meat or dairy- but she can't have most crackers because somewhere in the ingredients is a tiny bit of milk or butter or something. So just keep that in mind that you have to read ingredients on pretty much everything you eat unless it's fruit/veggies/beans/tofu.|`|WPVpOfuwaa	I am a vegetarian gone vegan myself.

The Portuguese introduced Brazilians to dried salt cod, Linguica, Spicy meat stews and desserts such as corn and rice pudding. The African people who were brought to Brazil as slaves, introduced okra, dende oil and peppercorns in this region.<br>  <br>  The main dish of Brazil is Feijoda Completa, which is made from black beans that have been cooked with smoked meat and sausages and is generally served with rice, diced oranges, boiled greens made from vegetables and chilly sause. It is topped with toasted cassava meal. Common drinks of Brazil are Coffee, rum and beer. <br>  <br>  The Brazilian people like to have a simple breakfast which mainly comprises of Coffee, Milk, Bread and Jam. At times they prefer to eat Cheese and Ham for breakfast with some fresh fruits at the side.<br>  <br>  <br>  The slaves in the colonial Brazil created the "Feijoada". <br>  <br>  They started cooking the pork meats that Farmland owners discarded such as ear, tails, feet in a big pot with black beans. <br>  <br>  This dish became traditional all over the country. Since then, the dish was incremented with pork sirloin and sausages that transformed the menu in a famous entrée that everybody who visit Brazil have to taste.  <br>  <br>  The following recipe is an easy-to-do version of Feijoada made only with pork tenderloin and sausages.<br>  <br>  This recipe is preferred for busy people that  don't want to handle the salted pork ears,  tails and feet found in the complete Feijoada.<br>   <br>   <br>  INGREDIENTS:<br>     <br>  1 lb of varied pork sausages (prefer smoked sausages)<br>  <br>  1 lb of pork tenderloin<br>  <br>  some slices of bacon<br>  <br>  1 can of black beans (15.5Oz)<br>  <br>  2 tbs vegetable oil<br>  <br>  salt, garlic, chopped onions and bay leaves (bay leaves give a special taste to feijoada)<br>   <br>   <br>  PREPARE:<br>     <br>  Feijoada is made with black beans and pork meats.<br>  <br>  You can use a can of beans already cooked or learn how to cook dried beans.<br>  <br>  Add black beans to a medium-sized pot with 2 tbs oil, salt, garlic, chopped onions and about 6 bay leaves.<br>  <br>  Cook for about 15 minutes in med heat and set aside.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  In a separated panfry, cook cubes of pork tenderloin and slices of bacon with salt, garlic. <br>  <br>  Add all the sausages sliced and stir medium-heat until dry all the water.<br>  <br>  Add the cooked meat to the pan with the black beans and your feijoada is ready!<br>  <br>  Cook your feijoada more 10 minutes to meat soak in the black beans.

Chicken thighs have more flavor (and fat) and Asian markets often carry pork butt that is already cut into stew pieces you can use for adobo.  It is more fatty, but tastes good.  If you want to use meat with less fat, you could increase the soy sauce and vinegar by a tablespoon or two to have more liquid to braise your meat.  Also, braise at a very low temperature with the lid on so your liquid doesn't evaporate, drying out your adobo.

CeXKPtCRaa	As long as you drink when you are thirsty, you don't even need to worry about the amount you're supposed to drink daily - there is no set amount.  You get water from just about every food that you eat.  Your body is smart and knows when its chemistry is off, so just drink when you feel like it and you'll be fine.  Also, if you get a headache, a lot of times it's from dehydration, so just drink some extra water whenever you get one (or of course, when you get sick).  All the stuff about "at least 8 cups a day" or "drink so many oz for pound of body weight" is a bunch of nonsense.  It all depends on how much water you get from your food and your body type or whatever other specific body needs you have, so there's no way to tell.  Your body is smart enough as it is, let it do the work for you!<br>  <br>  So yes, flavored water is perfectly fine!

Most BBQ sauces are based on either a vinegar or tomato base. I prefer tomato, so a good start is some ketchup. <br>  <br>  From there you need some sweetness to balance it out. Honey, molasses and brown sugar all work well. You'll also need some spice for balance. Minced chilies, or hot sauces work well here. You'll also need to add some saltiness and tanginess. For salt you can use either regular or sea salt, or something like soy sauce. For the tanginess you can use vinegar (white, wine, red, malt, etc...).<br>  <br>  Now that you have a balanced sauce base, you need to add the flavours. Here's where you can experiment. Dijon, garlic, onion, paprika, ginger, Worcestershire and many other flavours can add depth to the sauce, as can several alcohols like whiskey/bourbon/etc...<br>  <br>  Now all you need is a nice chunk of  meat to baste.<br>  <br>  Enjoy!|`|ttfuh5pKaa	This is a copycat recipe that comes close to the taste of Bull’s Eye Original Barbecue Sauce.

There was this whole thing on the History Channel a week ago, see. In '78, plastic bottles were rolled out.

It's not until recently that the glass bottles have come back out. <br>  <br>  Diet Coke didn't arrive on the scene until '82, and prior to HFCS, straight cane sugar was the most prominent sweetner in the US.

s4WywJ8baa	Originally Absinthe was made with wormwood. Slightly toxic and yes it did cause hallucinations in the long term. It is no illegal (for the most part) in almost all countries. People have even gone insane drinking (certain famous American writer who was addicted to the stuff).<br>  <br>  Ouzo, from Greece was originally made with the poppy pods that also make Heroin. However, that was banned decades ago also. By law they can't put the poppies into it any more. Heroin is a pain killer.<br>  <br>  The effect of the two where never alike.<br>  <br>  (A little research on you part on the internet will prevent you from loosing points and getting wrong information from people who don't know what they are talking about.)|`|mJaJplXtaa	The hallucinogenic properties of absinthe are a myth or are -- at the very least -- vastly overstated. However, it WILL get you very drunk. I've had 3 different kinds, and all of them were at least 45% alcohol or higher. So in that sense, yes Ouzo will have about the same physical effects.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I take it by the multiple thumbs down that people disagree. I'll only give you this and let you make up your own mind:<br>  <br>  "Contrary to popular misconception, absinthe is not hallucinogenic, psychedelic, or narcotic... The hallucinations suffered by 19th century 'absinthistes' were those of severe chronic alcoholism and dementia. " - The Wormwood Society Absinthe Association<br>  <br>  "Breaux ran tests on pre-ban absinthe samples, as well as on samples spiked with thujone [active ingredient in wormwood], allowing him to isolate the toxic compound. He spent his free time studying the test results, and late one night in June 2000 he had his answer... In the antique absinthes he had collected, the thujone content was an order of magnitude smaller than [previous] predictions. In many instances, it was a homeopathically minuscule 5 parts per million." - Wired<br>  <br>  "The madness and seizures attributed to absinthe were more likely attributable to drinking large amounts of high proof alcohol and the caustic chemicals the bootleg absinthe distillers included in their recipes." - Modern Drunkard<br>  <br>  "By the end of the distillation process, there is very little thujone left in the product. Modern science has estimated that a person drinking absinthe would die from alcohol poisoning long before he or she were affected by the thujone. And there is no evidence at all that thujone can cause hallucinations, even in high doses." - How Stuff Works<br>  <br>  "...despite years of research discrediting the transcendental effects, new bottles of absinthe can be sold in the U.S. only if they are classified as thujone-free." - Time<br>  <br>  "...in 1999 Meschler and Howlett determined that thujone had no activity at the cannabinoid [THC] receptor... There is no evidence that absinthe ever contained the high concentrations of thujone that would have led to detrimental effects or that it has hallucinogenic or mind altering properties. The health problems experienced by chronic users were likely to have been caused by adulterants in inferior brands and by the high levels of alcohol present." - Ian Hutton, La Fee Verte<br>  <br>  "...thujone concentrations as high as 260 mg/l, reported in the 19th century, cannot be confirmed by our study. With regard to their thujone concentrations, the hallucinogenic potential of vintage absinthes can be assessed being rather low because the historic products also comply with today's maximum limits derived to exclude such effects." - Forensic Science International<br>  <br>  "Today, a questionable tendency of absinthe manufacturers can be ascertained that use the ancient theories of absinthism as a targeted marketing strategy to bring absinthe into the spheres of a legal drug-of-abuse. Misleading advertisements of aphrodisiac or psychotropic effects of absinthe try to re-establish absinthe's former reputation." - journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy<br>  <br>  "The reputation of Wormwood as a hallucinogen was promoted by many of the forces seeking to demonize absinthe in the early 1900s. It is generally regarded to be a myth." - Lucid, a modern brand of absinthe<br>  <br>  "The most popular misconception about absinthe is that it is a drug, or at least similar to a drug in effect. This is not true. The hysteria surrounding absinthe in the early 20th century fueled the misconception that absinthe was a powerful intoxicant, caused hallucinations that drove men 'mad,' threw them into epileptic fits, and made Van Gogh slice off his ear." - Virtual Absinthe Museum FAQ<br>  <br>  "Wormwood and absinthe are sometimes described as 'hallucinogenic,' but there is little evidence that they are psychedelics in any reasonable sense of the word." - Erowid Extracts|`|HZvdr8VLaa	The absinthe you can buy today has a very high alcohol level, but no longer any hallucination qualities..  unless you can find some overseas which is very old.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	No.  Absinthe has hallucinogenic properties.|`|TzPofCDxaa	No.<br>  Absinthe is awful stuff for weird effects.<br>  Ouzo will just get you pi##ed.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Never had Absinthe, but I frequently drink ouzo.

jU6hOadFaa	You would really only need to add gluten if you are using a very "hard" flour.  100% whole wheat, rye, buckwheat, spelt, etc. would need a little extra gluten.<br>  <br>  If you use regular white flour you should be fine with no added gluten.<br>  <br>  If you can get "Best for Bread" or Bread Machine flour at your grocery store, that is even better.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	With whole wheat breads, it is common for a recipe to call for "vital wheat gluten"    Whole wheat bread is denser and has less elasticity and adding the vital wheat gluten helps make the bread more elastic and gives it more of a rise.<br>  <br>  Adding additional gluten would be unusual for any white flour recipe|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	If you are allergic to gluten you can use a gluten free recipe:<br>  <br>  Gluten Free Bread Recipe <br>  <br>  2/3 cup white rice flour<br>  2/3 cup arrowroot (tapioca)<br>  2/3 cup maize cornflour<br>  1 ? tsp xanthin gum<br>  1 tsp unflavoured gelatine<br>  1 tsp powdered egg replacer<br>  ? tsp salt<br>  1 Tbs plus 2 tsp sugar<br>  ? cup dry milk powder<br>  2 tsp yeast<br>  <br>  1 egg plus 1 egg white<br>  3 tbs vegetable oil<br>  ? tsp apple cider vinegar<br>  2 tsp honey<br>  1tbs LSA (linseed, sunflower, and almond) optional<br>  1 cup very warm water, approx.<br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 200 degree C.

Slice when bread has cooled.|`|AA10928232	Use bread flour and you probalby won't have to add extra gluten.<br>  <br>  Although I've discovered that in my BM, by adding extra gluten, the loaves rise beautifully and stay shaped nicely.<br>  <br>  You can find gluten on the bread aisle in little clear bags by "Bob's Red Mill."  They are displayed in little cardboard boxes.  Find the one that says "Vital Wheat Gluten" and use 1-2 Tbsp of that in your BM.|`|8BGehWCoaa	You really ought to add it to get a better rise and "fluffier" bread that lasts longer on the shelf and is less crumbly, especially if you're using whole wheat flour.  The general rule is 1 tablespoon of gluten per 1 cup of flour (I think the gluten box says 4 teaspoons per loaf but this really isn't enough).|`|fznvQptlaa	if the recipe calls for more add it. you can buy it on the flour/sugar aisle in a small box or container|`|xHvnGjCKaa	I've never heard of adding more gluten. Gluten, like you said is in the flour, which means gluten will form once other ingredients like milk and butter is mix with it. With those liquids and when it's proving, gluten will increase as it forms. Just follow a good reliable recipe and you'll be fine.<br>  P.S. Maybe you can try strong flour for more gluten?!|`|xUNowEfQaa	Adding gluten gives your bread more of a tender crumb.  I usually add gluten to my bread recipes.  It also adds protein and can add vitamin C.
