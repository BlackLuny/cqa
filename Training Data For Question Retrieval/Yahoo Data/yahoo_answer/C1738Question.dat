Isn't it a discriminatory practice to limit the tax deductions of some Americans while others have them available?  Why should Americans tolerate this blatant discrimination?  Wouldn't a flat tax on all income of all earners (multinational corporations as well) be a better plan.  All earners would pay the same % of their income to the Treasury.  No tax deductions, no tax credits.

20090305013142AAP73i9	News & Events;Current Events	Should NHS prescriptions be free?	Doctors are urging the Government to abolish prescription charges for all patients.      Failure to do so will lead to an arbitrary system of "winners and losers", the British Medical Association (BMA) warned.      It said the Government in England should follow the example of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland and make prescriptions free for everyone.      Public health minister Dawn Primarolo said: "In England, 89 per cent of prescription items are dispensed for free, the remainder provide valuable income to the NHS, of ￡437 million in 2009/10, which goes towards to the safety and speed of healthcare.....      So should patients have to pay for their prescriptions, should some have to pay or should they all be free?      Your views?       http://itn.co.uk/news/1e3d0e0f696023d202...

I have watched Tony Blair with Clinton, and then as soon as he came out of office, switch to Bush without taking a breath (different politics to Clinton).  Now we have Brown doing the same thing with Obama.  Why do they feel the UK has to be joined at the hip with the Yanks (with due respect to them because I have no problem with your average American!!).

20090305015600AAWFyuq	News & Events;Current Events	Is this what Modern Religion is all about? An E Mail I got. Your Opinions,diverse as they will be?	Allah or the Lord Jesus Christ?             The Muslim religion is by far the fastest growing religion in the UK .      Last month I attended my annual training session that's required for   maintaining my prison security clearance. During the training session   there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman   Catholic, Protestant and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their   beliefs.      I was particularly interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The   Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a   video.      After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers.      When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked:      'Please, correct me if I'm wrong, but I understand that most Imams and   clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad [Holy war] against the   infidels of the world and, that by killing an infidel, (which is a command to       all Muslims) they are assured of a place in heaven.         If that's the case, can you give me the definition of an infidel?'      There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation,   he replied, 'Non-believers!'      I responded, 'So, let me make sure I have this straight. All followers   of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith   so they can have a place in heaven. Is that correct?'      The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command   to that of 'a little boy who had just been caught with his hand in the   cookie jar.'      He sheepishly replied, 'Yes.'      I then stated, 'Well, I have a real problem trying to imagine Pope   Benedict commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr.   Stanley ordering all Protestants to do the same in order to guarantee them   a place in heaven!'      The Imam was speechless!   I continued, 'I also have a problem with being your 'friend' when you   and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me! Let me   ask you a question. Would you rather have your Allah, who tells you to   kill me in order for you to go to heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love   you because I am going to heaven and He wants you to be there with me?'      You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam remained speechless.      Needless to say, the organizers and promoters of the 'Diversification'   training seminar were not happy with this way of dealing with the   Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslims' beliefs.      Within twenty years there will be enough Muslim voters in the U.K. to   elect a government of their choice, complete with sharia law.    I think everyone in the U.K. should be required to read this, but with   the Liberal justice system, liberal media and the political correctness   madness, there is no way this will be widely publicised.            Please pass this on to all your e-mail contacts.      John Harrison MBE. MIDSc

20061208103734AAGHZvC	News & Events;Other - News & Events	Que pensez vous de ce texte?	Fan?ois, après avoir vu dans l'au delà ses ancêtres, leur souffrance lui est insupportable, s'est endormi et dans une sorte de prison il fait une expérience étrange.      "Il dort, mais le ? il ? s’identifie à l’enveloppe corporelle parce que l’ame veille. Elle s’est glissée hors de sa prison de chair, heureuse, libérée, parfaitement consciente. Elle flotte au-dessus du lit : pour un peu ce serait la même sensation qu’au matin de sa mort. Cette fois, elle n’a pas entendu le grésillement désagréable, ni n’a été dans une espèce de tunnel sombre et inquiétant. Elle est dehors, joyeuse et l’opération s’est déroulée tranquillement, naturellement. Elle per?oit très nettement des vibrations amicales qui dansent près d’elle. Une douce sensation de chaleur dans laquelle elle peut se blottir, se réfugier. Fran?ois sait qu’il peut sortir de sa ge?le quand il le souhaite, ni les portes fermées à double tour, ni les murs compacts ne pourront l’en empêcher. Il regarde les objets et les murs de sa cellule. Sa vue est d’une acuité extraordinaire, plus développée que le meilleur des microscopes et ce qu’il voit est proprement stupéfiant. La compacité des choses a disparu. Il entre dans ce que les physiciens ne parviennent pas à visualiser malgré leurs tentatives. Il voyage dans les entrailles intimes de la petite table qu’il regarde comme un contemplatif qui découvrirait une vérité lumineuse et inaccessible.      Rien ne lui para?t solide, tangible. Un indescriptible désordre semble régner de prime abord. L’ame est assise au bord de l’infiniment petit, au bord du réel, du palpable. Plus loin est un ab?me, un océan sans limite, creusé de vagues énigmatiques qui se perdent dans un horizon noir et lointain. Ce que Fran?ois vit est vertigineux. Il pénètre au sein mystérieux d’une molécule. Il y découvre le noyau et ses électrons. En franchissant le c?ur de ce noyau, il est soumis à un bombardement de particules élémentaires et de nucléons qui déchire le vide dans un fracas microcosmique effroyable. Fran?ois poursuit son invraisemblable périple au creux de l’infiniment petit et parvient à distinguer, dans cet univers protonique, le choc étourdissant des hadrons dont les gerbes d’entités infra atomiques sont aussit?t détruites et disparaissent. Puis, parvenu à la lisière la plus éloignée de la matière, de la parcelle en bois de la table, Fran?ois ne rencontre plus rien, il rencontre le rien comme si l’étonnante féerie à laquelle il venait d’assister n’avait été qu’une illusion, une fumée abstraite, le substrat ultime, une idée, dont la silhouette n’est plus visible que par un acte mathématique. Pourtant, il sent qu’au bout des choses, au bout de la table, est une ondulation évanescente, un champ des possibles qui sous-tendent les phénomènes observables, un souffle immanent imperceptible, régentant l’agitation des particules élémentaires et ordonnan?ant la valse des milliards de milliards d’atomes vibrionnant autour d’équilibres instables. Ce souffle est la pensée en action, le logos, l’étoffe dont est fait le réel, le champ primordial caractérisé par un état de supra symétrie, d’ordre et de perfection absolus ; l’intelligence dépouillée et parfaite.   Alors, de l’ame, de la petite ame de Fran?ois, s’élève l’idée que les objets ne sont qu’une illusion déployant un cortège d’apparences et de leurres que les êtres humains identifient à la réalité. Seule, la Pensée est.
