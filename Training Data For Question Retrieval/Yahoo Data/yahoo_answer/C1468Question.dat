20090203091125AAXX6cI	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What would you do in this case with a roommate from hell?	Well again for the second time he gave me half of what he is supposed to pay and told me if I would pay the cable bill with it.   With him being here, my electric bill has gone through the roof. He has no respect for it. He constantly leaves everything on until of course I come home and turn it off.   So I ended up paying the electric bill instead. My cable is being shut off and I know he will be very upset.   These bills are in my name and the electric bill takes priority.    Should I have paid the cable bill since that was what he wanted me to do with it?   Or am I right in going against what he wanted and paying for the electric bill.   He just rents a room in my house, it's not like this is a formal agreement. I gave him notice 2 days ago that he needs to find another place to stay.

Ok, so one of my best friends is obSINity, former Ms. Apollo National (second of three Birmingham queens to win in the last three years, but that's totally unrelated). His real name is Billy and i'm starting to get the impression that he's got feelings for me. I love this guy to death, but honestly i think he's more attractive as a woman and can never imagine doing anything more than cuddling. I am gay, but I think it could be the enormous wig/shaven head contrast that makes the difference in my opinion of attractiveness... I like long hair on my guys...      Anyway, should he bring it up, what is the best way to tell him that I'd sooner do him as a woman than as a man? O.o

20081117055608AAcNwPt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Bom, recentemente, fiz a Pergunta abaixo (leiam abaixo), e fui criticado por uma usuária; porque...?	A Pergunta é esta: "Por que maioria das religi?es e mitologias têm dezenas ou centenas de Deuses, e o cristianismo só um?", e eu falei que sou católico e também aprecio o protestantismo e o espiritismo (menos a parte pentecostal; porque eu li o Evangelho / Bíblia Sagrada 3 vezes, e o pentecostalismo distorce completamente o que diz o Livro; apesar que eu deixo quieto quem é destas igrejas).      Daí, a pessoa falou que um verdadeiro católico n?o se interessa por outras religi?es, e ainda buscou se justificar, e eu só dei avalia??o positiva a ela porque ela n?o falou por mal e se dissertou a respeito.      Que vocês acham disto? O que ela falou tem procedência ou n?o; porque raz?o? Quem quiser, pode procurar a Pergunta e lê-la toda; para poder concluir melhor.      Argumentem aí; por favor!

20081130125902AAVAN4G	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Essa é só pra quem gosta de ler ..... ?	Pra quem gosta de ler coisas até melosas assim, igual a mim..    Vai esse texto ... E se você conhecer um bacana, como esse (que eu acho bacana..rs) Coloque ai pra nos ...rs Mas, claro, algo que você concorde  e que transmita para nos, tra?os de sua personalidade e opini?o ..    Um abra?o ..       "Por que você ama quem você ama?       Ninguém ama outra pessoa pelas qualidades que ela tem, caso contrário os honestos, simpáticos e n?o-fumantes teriam uma fila de pretendentes batendo à porta.      O amor n?o é chegado a fazer contas, n?o obedece a raz?o. O verdadeiro amor acontece por empatia, por magnetismo.      Ninguém ama outra pessoa porque ela é educada, veste-se bem e é f? do Caetano. Isso s?o só referenciais. Ama-se pelo cheiro, pelo mistério, pela paz que o outro lhe dá, ou pelo tormento que provoca. Ama-se pelo tom de voz, pela maneira que os olhos piscam, pela fragilidade que se revela quando menos se espera.      Ent?o que ela tem um jeito de sorrir que o deixa imobilizado, o beijo dela é mais viciante do que LSD, você adora brigar com ela e ela adora implicar com você. Isso tem nome.      Você ama aquele cafajeste. Ele diz que vai e n?o liga, ele veste o primeiro trapo que encontra no armário. Ele n?o tem a maior voca??o para príncipe encantado, e ainda assim você n?o consegue despachá-lo. Quando a m?o dele toca na sua nuca, você derrete feito manteiga. Ele toca gaita de boca, adora animais e escreve poemas. Por que você ama este cara? N?o pergunte para mim.      Você é inteligente. Lê livros, revistas, jornais. Gosta dos filmes dos irm?os Coen e do Robert Altman, mas sabe que uma boa comédia romantica também tem o seu valor. é bonita. Seu cabelo nasceu para ser sacudido num comercial de xampu e seu corpo tem todas as curvas no lugar (ou quase). Independente, emprego fixo, bom saldo no banco. Gosta de viajar, de música, tem loucura por computador e seu fettucine ao pesto é imbatível. Você tem bom humor, n?o pega no pé de ninguém. Com um currículo desse, criatura, por que diabo está sem um amor?      Ah, o amor, essa raposa. Quem dera o amor n?o fosse um sentimento, mas uma equa??o matemática: eu linda + você inteligente = dois apaixonados. N?o funciona assim. Amar n?o requer conhecimento prévio nem consulta ao SPC. Ama-se justamente pelo que o Amor tem de indefinível. Honestos existem aos milhares, generosos tem às pencas, bons motoristas e bons pais de família, tá assim, ó!      Mas ninguém consegue ser do jeito do amor da sua vida!"

20090220200804AA3CroH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Am I considered a backslider?	about a year ago...right before I met my boyfriend.  I was extremely faithful with God.  I prayed to him daily and was beginning to read my bible alot.  I could hear and literally see God working in my life on a Daily basis.  I was convicted of no sex before marriage. ANd I could feel God turning my heart to be more like Him everyday.  Also I used to go out alot, and then for about 5 months or so I didn't go out to clubs at all and I focused on God and being with more christians activities.  And it felt good.        about 1 year later...   I live with my boyfriend.  I don't read my bible hardly at all.  I have sex and sin. my heart is weighed down.  I still go to church- I just feel really really guilty if I do. I still love God, I just feel I have no power in my life.  WHen I pray, it has no power and I can't feel the holy spirit like I used to. What is going on?  How can I get back to being Jesus and get a fruitful life?

20090220204646AAeopCr	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How did different ethnicities develop if there is no evolution?	This is a question for those who practice Christianity.    Ok from what I understand, Adam and Eve are the first and only human beings, and we somehow ended up with different races, even though there is no evolution.    I can guarantee that the closer you get to the equator (and the hotter it gets) the darker the natives are, because darker skin is better for sun protection. If these people haven't evolved over generations and adapted to their environments, why and HOW are they darker than the rest of the world? If human beings all came from 2 individuals, how is there such diversity in the world today?   I do know the story about how god created different languages so that doesn't need to be explained. I just want the bible's explanation of how different ethnicity's came to be if everything is incapable of evolution.      I'm working on a sort of 'reflection' personal essay that is organizing my thoughts concerning religion. A simple answer to the question will suffice, preferably with actual quotes from the bible if you are really that dedicated. Thanks in advance because I really would rather not pull out the bible and start trying to find this specific answer...

We need to translate all these important papers into spanish and have the president learn spanish and gives a few speeches in spanish so that he can communicate better with a large portion of the latin and latin-american community. There are still many of us that understand spanish better than english and these people need to know what's up as well. All they really got is like one or two media channels and the same anchors for the past 15-20 years.       We also need to change some of the numbers on our currency to include spanish words as well. It should mix and match like "five" and "cinco", and maybe later down the road we can include "woo" and "cinq" to incorporate our ever increasing diversity and cultures.

I have this very rare first addition of what is like, the bible of the free masons.The History of Masonry by Mitchell -1871. My father John Shelton, was a member and so were some ancestors. They built “Rural Plains” near Studley it is the oldest home in Hanover County, dating back to 1670. Sir John Shelton received the property on which it stands through a King’s Grant bestowed in 1609, and it has remained in the Shelton family since. It is the oldest home in the United States in continuous possession of one family. Patrick Henry married Sarah Shelton at “Rural Plains” in 1754. It was damaged by Confederate cannonballs during the Battle of Totopotomoy Creek in 1864. With this type of history should I sell even though I'm deep in debt?

20090220213215AAZnUyd	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	How can I stop getting angry at people's questions and answers and creating more conflict?	I get angry and offended, and then I say offensive and insulting things, and then it just fuels the other person to say even more offensive things, and it's just a vicious unhelpful cycle. I want to stop doing this.   I'm asking in this section because this is the section it primarily occurs in for me.

20090220213916AAYmSeL	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Shouldn't we stop using "pro-life"?	The very term suggests people who support choice are anti-life, which is preposterous. It is precisely the point of contention whether or not a fetus is to be considered part of the human moral community. To call it "life" in the sense of being human thus begs the question (a fallacy). Why do those who are supporters of a woman's right to choose still using this accusatory, fallacious language?

20090220215806AABP4kR	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	The Bible as it is..............?	When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Leviticus 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They complain that the odor is not pleasing to them. I kill them for heresy?       b) I would like to sell my daughter as slave, as is allowed in Exodus 21:7. At the present time, what do you think would be a fair price for it?       c) I know that is not allowed to have contact with a woman while she is in her period of menstrual impurity (Leviticus 15:19 - 24). The problem is, as I say that to her? I have tried, but most women take it as offense.       d) Leviticus 25:44 states that I can possess slaves, both men and women, if they are purchased from neighboring nations. A friend of mine says it applies to Bolivians, but not the Argentine. You can clarify this? Why can not I have argentinos?       e) I have a neighbor who insists on working on Saturdays. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be dead. I am morally obligated to kill him myself?       f) A friend of mine feels that even though eating shellfish is an abomination (Leviticus 11:10), is a lesser abomination that worship images of wood. Concordo.Você I can clarify this point?       g) Leviticus 21:20 states that I can not bring me the altar of God if I have a defect in vision. Who USA glasses for reading, a vision that has to be 100%, or you can make a jeitinho?       h) Most of my male friends trim my beard, even the hair of the temples, even though this is expressly forbidden in Leviticus 19:27. How should they die?       i) My uncle has a farm. He violates Leviticus 19:19 planting two different kinds of plants in the same field. His wife also violates Leviticus 19:19, because USA clothes made of two different types of fabric (cotton and polyester). He also tends to curse and blaspheme a lot. It is really necessary that I call the entire city to stone them (Leviticus 24:10-16)? We simply could not burn them in a private ceremony, but should be done with people who have sex with her in-laws (Leviticus

This little poodle had been the love of this woman's life-I named him Timmy (no name given in news article) Timmy bit her nose off ran off with it in the garden-up and down the rows while her screams brought neighbors to chase Timmy down, collect the nose and the doctor sewed the nose back on. But, it looks like a mess and she will need lots of corrective surgeries. This, Timmy, slept on her bed and she always showed the kindest affection for him.

The myth is that when the moon looks like a smile exactly like )) but facing down, that it is going to rain. The more facing down it is, the heavier the rain will be. So when there is an upside down crescent moon would rain. I have found this to be true because I have even observed it. After 1 week of saying that moon, it rained. And I have observed it several times. It is pretty cool. Did you know about it?

My mom just had surgery and her jaw will be wired shut for 6 weeks.  I don't live at home and I'm wondering what the best options are for me to be able to call me (I won't have a computer so we can't IM).  She doesn't like AIM and I know there's a service that lets you do IM relay but we're not really interested in that.  I also need her to be able to call 911, especially since she lives far away from family and friends  (obviously she won't be answering the phone if they try to check in on her) and having a neighbor look in isn't a possibility.      Any suggestions that would meet our needs and recommendations for good (free) services are greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

Why should I when nobody wants me? On a scale of 1-10, I can honestly rate myself a 4 or a 4 and a half. I'm quiet and shy. I can't talk around girls because I'm THAT shy. I can only talk to them over the computer but never in person. I can easily open up around boys. I use to believe that there was somebody out there for everybody. I also believed that there has to be that one person who wanted love so much, but never found it. I'm starting to believe that I'm that person. I'm afraid of being alone... I am a closeted bi-sexual and I find no interest in guys.. Romantically that is. I have been with 2 in my entire life. I'm also reconsidering my label. Maybe I'm a lesbian? I just think that it's impossible for me to find anybody. Like everyone says, LBGT are minorities; there's not that many of us. My only hope left is a gay bar, but when I'm 21... What about college? I start fall......... What are the chances of me finding a girl there? I'm commuting. There's no parties for me. There's lots of girls experimenting. I do not wish to partake in such wh0rey actions that might lead to real feelings or attachment.. I want somebody real and I want somebody now. If I find out that I am destined to be alone, I will no longer be a part of this world.....

Well, I have lived in the deep south of Mississippi my entire life and it is a great place to live. The city I live in is one of America's Most Afffordable Towns To Live In and my high school has been named the Top 100 Of America's Best High Schools.Mississippi also has some of the most beautiful scenery, rich in history, and above all, some of the sweetest people in the world live here.    But over the years as I've traveled to different parts of the U.S, I've quickly learned that most people think that Mississippi is full of a bunch of hillbillies and rednecks who eat fried chicken and corn on the cob all day. I also have been told that most people think that Mississippians don't wear shoes, we don't have paved roads and we all are over-weight. Well, these so-called 'facts' are not true.   We all wear shoes, I've never been on a road in Miss. that wasn't paved and we are all quite healthy, atleast in the region in which I live.    Mississippi is often called the Hospitality State and we have one of the best economy systems since this recent economic meltdown.    So, please just say what you think and/or have heard about Mississippi.   Thanks

I guess I kind of understand that if you're talking about people that live and breathe music, because they pretty much waste their life away, but why is it haraam if you listen every once in a while?   Most people give the whole "it takes your mind away from Allah and it goes to a different place" speech, but I know a lot of people who are completely obsessed with sports and when a game is on, there is no taking their mind out of it.. I mean what's the difference here? What makes music so horrible if tv shows and sports have the same impact on you?   I don't really understand what "it takes your mind away from Allah" means, either. I mean when I'm doing my Biology homework, I'm concentrating on my homework and nothing else. Is this taking my mind away from Allah?

I tipped the stylist $50 on top of that, which I thought was generous. After I left I couldn't help but think that maybe that was too low, I don't know. I just can't really imagine spending $100 or more to tip when they are already charging SO much to get the extensions in. What do you think?  I was there for 3 hours.

So if you've ever lived on the bottom floor of an apartment you may know what I mean when I say that our upstairs neighbors are very, very loud. Not only TV and walking sounds, but arguing, screaming and talking and doors slamming, as well as stomping up and down the stairs. This happens sometimes as late as 11:30 at night. I try to be understanding during the day, but with an infant trying to sleep, I get easily agitated when this happens late.

The 1st is the hate racism when somebody hates somebody else just because of their race or where somebody hates a certain races or races other than their own.      the 2nd type is the preservative racism that people use to preserve their race or culture. as in they accuse people of their race of "acting white" or "acting black" or of being "sellouts" for liking another culture better than the one most common among their race.       so for those who are here on "other cultures and groups" do you consider race to be as irrelevant as I consider it to be to where you think anybody of any race should have the right to look and act how they want without getting judged for it? or do you have expectations for the people of your race to act and look a certain way?

20090220203458AA5lD9o	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Athiest why doesnt the bible count as evidence?	This is what is true at least.   These are facts if you want to challenge me put a citation up.   The cities/empires and regions mentioned all existed.   Jesus is in Roman/Jewish records. (Josephus just to name one)   Prophesies seem pretty accurate.   Miracles are a see to beleive event, cant be proven.   So doesnt the other bits count as evidence at least?   They werent done for nothing

20090220201527AAMUhZa	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Odd scenario?????????/?	Alright I am a heterosexual 17 year old male in highschool. I have never had a crush on a dude and dudes never subconciosuly or conciously enter my mind when I fanatize about sex. Their is this guy in my class who is effemine and looks like a girl with a nose ring and people call him names because he looks gay and different sometimes. We run in totally seperate crowds and I have my friends that I chill with. Well about a month ago I get automatically paired with him for a yearly project that is due at the end of the year. I first I was like no way. I wanted my teacher to switch but he sayed it was random and that was that. Guys in my class were making fun of my sisuation in a jokingly way. Well when we first started to talk to each other and I was distance, rude and mean. He wasn't mean back. I don't know but he would say you don't have to act like that just because people do it. I eventually stopped with it because he seemed so geniuely sincere and nice. He is the nicest person I have ever met. He seems so much more sincere then my friends who I currently have. We have become such good friends that I think that he is now the closest friend that I have now.I have cryed infront of him because I have told him things I would never tell anyone besides my parents, and he didn't sit their and judge me and call me a wuss like some would.I am not pyshically and emotionally attracted to him at all, and he is not really gay but i don't know, he is just is different. But people are looking at me because I am hanging out with him alot and people are starting to spread rumors about me. My parents and siblings will give me strange looks if I bring him over to hang out. They hold traditional values in every sense What do I do? I am confortable with with sexuality and I have never been really  homophobic,  i This is so odd and I never thought I would find myself in this sisuation.

I desperately need psychological help because i've reached my limit and i want to die, which scares me that i want that...i've reached the point where i can no longer cope deailing with medical illness that is unknown and therefore untreatable, being gay and having a very disfunctional family (parents always at work...plenty of money but im always alone and money rlly does not buy happiness)      The only thing keeping me here is my love of my best friend and not baring to think how he would blame himself if i killed myself.       Anyway is a school counsellor qualified for this sort of thing? Would they have to tell my parents? Because i can't have my parents find out (rlly not close) So i can't go to see a therapist without them finding out. I'm 17 and my school only hires the most experienced/best staff...so would she be able to help me with dealing with everything? or is that beyond the role of a school counsellor/?

Im sorry this is so long but Im so confused and need advice:      Ok so I made out with this boy once and got his number.  I was SOOOO excited and sooo happy. I couldn't think about anything else for the next two days -- the amount of time I think makes someone not look desperate. So I called... and he did not answer. Then I called again an hour later. And no answer. I was really bummed. I waited until the next weekend because I couldn't stop thinking about it and convinced myself that his cell phone had to of been broken and he had bought a new one and was awaiting a call from me haha. So I called... no answer.  This time I left a message saying "hey ___, this is ___, I just wanted to say I had a lot of fun the other night and was hoping you did too. Just give me a call back and maybe we can hang out sometime." Nothing.  So i left him alone cus three times is enough.       Then a few months later he came to a party at my house. We have really kick *** dance parties. Anyways... I finally got up the nerve to ask him to dance. He said "Yea!!" ... all excited and stuff. So we danced. Then later when he was leaving I was like "well can I walk you outside?" and so I did. And I got up the nerve to ask "can I kiss you before you leave, just to make this night awesome"... and he said yes... and we made out. I stopped for a second from making out and was like "Can I call you sometime?" and he was like "of course." and I was like "well im kind of scared to because last time you ignored my calls." he denied ignoring it and assured me that he would answer.       So I texted him two days later "Hey ____, how are you?" and he did not reply. I was so sad and unsure of whether to text again. My crazy side kept telling myself that the text didnt go through. Then, he texted me (four days later) "Sorry I forgot to respond. Whats up?" ... I immediately I got SO happy my eyes were watering and I was hysterically laughing... it was actually pretty embarrassing. Luckily I was alone. So we were texting for a little bit and I was asking if he wanted to get something to eat sometime and he goes "Yea we should definitely hang out! I have to write this paper but I will talk to you later." Take note of the exclamation point. So I assumed he would write me later... but he didnt. Sadly another four days went by and I was so confused again... I decided that since he said what he said I would just text him cus maybe he is playing the game. So I said "hey, would you like to maybe get something to eat with me sometime this week?" .... and he has never responded. Its been two weeks. Sooooo WHAT THE PHUCK!    What in the world does this mean and why the hell is he treating me like this? He is so cute and I can't stop stalking him on facebook. Would it be weird to defriend him... i really want to. Plus he is the one that friended me... he is filled with mixed messages. Sorry again its so long

20090220200800AAMskUQ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is it possible that Jesus Christ and Michael The Archangel could be the same person?	The name Michael means "Who is like God?" It appears only five times in the Bible. The expression "Archangel" which means the first and the chief Angel is never found in the plural in the Bible, basically implying that there is only one. At 1Thessalonians 4:16, The command of Jesus Christ for the resurrection to begin is described as "The Archangel's call," and Jude 9 says that the Archangel is Michael. Would it be appropriate to liken Jesus' commanding call to that of someone lesser in authority?...................Think about it.  Revelation 12: 7-12 speaks of how Michael and his angels would war against Satan and hurl him and his wicked angels out of heaven. At Revelation 19: 11-16 Jesus here described as "The Word of God" is leading the armies of heaven in war against the nations of the world. So could it be that the Son of God whom we know to be Jesus Christ, was known as Michael before he came to earth and is known also by that name since his return to heaven where he resides as the glorified spirit Son of God.    ----------------------------------------...

20090220201723AAtMyzs	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is this real or just in my mind? (lots of reading)?	About two weeks ago, i was helping my dad fix the ceiling fan. Well he told me to turn the power off at the circuit box, so i did. I went back to the room where we were putting the ceiling fan up and he told me to turn the box off. He turned the light on, so we went back to the box and shut it off. Then we left and started taking the ceiling fan out. He told me to hold it up so it didn't fall, while he got a screwdriver.       Next thing i know, i'm on the ground and he's yelling my name and shaking me, trying to get me to wake up. When i was finally able to sit up without feeling woozy, he said that i was electrocuted and that an ambulance was on its way.       Anyway, when i got out of the hospital, i had to be careful about what i touched because i seemed to shock everything i touched. It wasn't a deadly one, but the kind of shock you get from shuffling your socked feet against a rug, only a bit stronger. This happened for about a week before it finally stopped.      A few days later, my parents went to the Cape for a night and my sister and I were home alone. We were playing video games that night and i kept hearing footsteps on the front deck. She kept asking me what was wrong because i kept turning around and looking out the window. When i told i heard footsteps she gave me a strange look so i stopped looking and they stopped. But then a few minutes later it sound as if someone was trying to bang the door down. I flipped out and dropped the controller. She just starred at me as if i was crazy and i asked if she heard it and she said "heard what?" I ran to the door and turned on the light but no one was there. I asked her if she was trying to pull a prank on me and she said no, she really didn't hear anything. I locked the doors and tried to ignore everything.      The next night i was sitting in the living room and i was watching television. It was around 2am because i couldn't sleep, so i was the only one awake. No one had been on the computer for a good 6 hours, so the screen was black. And when it's in "sleep mode" the only way to turn the screen on is if someone moves the mouse or presses a key. If you don't do that, the screen stays black. Well anyway, i was sitting the chair and by the corner of my eye, i see the screen light up. I got up and went over and the mouse was in the same place it was before so someone must have tapped a key. I touched the keyboard and it was freezing, as if it had been in the freezer. I put the computer back into "sleep mode" and sat back down, trying to forget about it. A few moments later, it did the same thing. I freaked out, turned the t.v off and ran to my bedroom.      About an hour later, i woke up to a loud sound, as if something fell off my shelf. I turned the light on and saw my Guinea Pig's water bottle on the other side of the room. I looked for the hook that holds it to the cage and it was still on the cage. My guinea pig couldn't have hit it off. It was completely full and twice as big as he is. And it didn't roll, it was on the other side of the room as if someone had taken it off the cage and dropped it. I put it back and it didn't happen again.      The night after that, i was the only one awake again because it was past midnight. Deciding to go to bed, i turned off the computer and the living room lights and ran into the kitchen where there were lights on. (i'm terrified of the dark). Well once i calmed down, i opened the fridge and got a bottle of water. As i went to take a drink i heard something that sounded like "Hey" or "No." it was male's voice and it wasn't my father. I've lived in this house since 1999 - i know EVERY sound of this house when it settles, and THAT was not one of them. It was a male's voice and it wasn't my father.       Whenever something happens when someone else is around, they don't seem to notice it.      What's going on? Am I just imagining all this? Is this like, some freak side affect from getting shocked or is this real?       It's really starting to scare me!

Who better to judge you, than the person that knows you best... you. You know right from wrong. What's right for some is wrong for others since we are not all made equally. I don't think a certain book is approved or made by god to tell man how to be. I believe a book was written by man to let man know the ways of life and  to let man  know what's right and wrong. I also believe the bible is written only for certain time periods and i believe the bible is getting outdated very quick. What used to be right 100,000 years ago would be considered savage and evil today.   Alright well i feel myself starting to drift from my point. All i'm trying to say is that I think god is in you. I forget where i heard this quote but, "this is my world, you're just living in it." is very true. That doesnt mean you do whatever you want, you do what's right because you know it's right and that all actions have consequences, regardless of how big or small the action is. Ok... well..... does anyone feel the same way. i wanna see paragraphs and pages written back =)

20090220201941AAnC9mD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Oh, so this means I'm gay?	Yeah so, I'm gonna get right to it.   I'm 14 and I'm having a problem determining my sexuality. I know I probably shouldn't worry about it at this "young age" but eh, I've decided too. Anyway, since puberty I've been having these feelings - for guys. :\   But it's making me really confused! I never really find myself fantasizing about anyone, nor do I have "sexual dreams". Like not about a women or a man, I just don't have them. I guess I'm mostly a  clean-minded person. But yeah, I'm really confused. Last night, I watched a movie with my cousin, and he kept making these comments about the actresses boobs and how hot she was but I just liked looking at the guys with the shirt off, and I like *sort-of* like lost my breath for a minute when I see them. I just find guys reallllly appealing for some reason. I don't know. I don't feel too normal and I'm basically completely confused. I mean, I guess I could see myself with a guy, but I just know what'd my parents would think and everything. :| Idk! This is sort of embarrassing for me, ha. But okay, I just need your opinions and please no rude ones, or anything like that, if there's alot of negative answers I'll just delete this. Please try to be nice? Oh and please ask if you need more details, because I know I forgot probably some important information or something. Anyway, thank you!

For some reason i'm so excited about my future and what lays ahead. My family is middle class and my dad is worried about losing his job. My brother moved out and isn't going to college. Really no one in my family went to college. Were all middle class. I don't want that to be me. I don't want my kids to have to worry if they're parents are going to lose their job. I want to go to college and actually do something with my life. I plan not to lose my virginity or get married until i can provide for myself in case something happens and i get pregnant. I'm home schooled and i've been studying so hard. I just want to prove to everyone that i'm going to do something. I've been saving up money from babysitting and when i turn 16 i'm going to get a job and save every little bit of money i make. I just want to do something for myself, i want to make all the right decisions. I never want to screw up. I want to show everyone that i did everything right. I just want to be proud of myself. The thing is my uncle and i were talking about this. He said  that i shouldn't be planning everything out. He said that i need to let things out and in, to not ruin all my youth. What do you think?

20090220204837AASuKUG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do some people assume just because you're white you've been in America for hundreds of years?	In one of my classes at school we're learning about the Caribbean and abolition day, etc. Anyway my teacher is Mexican-American and when she starts talking about the Caribbean she decides to give us a little "history lesson" about how white people enslaved the native Americans in the Caribbean and then took Africans over. The whole time she was looking at me (I'm the only white person in the class.) lol? What is she trying to prove? I'm FROM Ireland... I moved to America when I was 8... She is a 30 year old hispanic american... Her family has been here for probably 40 years longer than mine. Besides, Irish people never enslaved anyone. We were enslaved the same way Africans were. It's kind of annoying that some people like to generalize... Just because my skin is white I'm classified into that same group of people that murdered and enslaved around the world. I really wish people could just see beyond skin color.

Why is it that the only thing the Apostle Paul ever mentioned about the life of Jesus was that he died and rose from the dead three days later?  He never mentioned anything about the ministry of Christ.  It makes me wonder if the gospels were written after the Pauline epistles, because he obviously had never read them.  Which also makes me wonder how we could believe a story to be credible that was written so many years after the event happened.  Futhermore, how do you sort through all of the contradictions of the resurrection story?  If you don't know what I'm talking about, here you go:       http://atheism.about.com/od/gospelcontra...

20090203094422AAyC42V	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Since the Gospel of Thomas agrees with Acts, why can't we consider it Canon?	Gospel of Thomas      12 The disciples said to Jesus, "We know that you are going to leave us. Who will be our leader?"   Jesus said to them, "No matter where you are you are to go to James the Just, for whose sake heaven and earth came into being."         Acts 21:18 (New King James Version)   18 On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.         Galatians 2:12 (King James Version)      12   "For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."         So since they all agree, why can't we consider it Canon?
20090203092410AAvoBD5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Jesus was not God in the flesh then why?	I get tired of trying to prove Jesus' divinity. But Im hoping that with pure facts someone may say you know what it is true. If Jesus wasnt God in the flesh, then why when he was worshipped he never denied the worship? If he wasnt God then he wouldve rebuked the worshippers because he has said to the devil himself " worship God and him only". Therefore if you believe that Christ is the Son of God full of truth, then why cant you see this truth? He wouldnt go against his own commandments. Therefore when people worshipped him he never said, do not worship me because I am not God. Here are the verses he was worshipped.      John 9:38 Then the man said, Lord I believe, and he worshipped him.       Read the verse after this and you see that Jesus never said do not worship me.      Matthew 28:17 When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some doubted.       Look at what Jesus said  to his disciples afterwards. He rebuked them for many things but never rebuked them for worshipping him.      Look at these verses.      John 10:33      We are not stoning you for any of these, replied the Jews, but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man claim to be God.      Did Jesus deny this claim? Instead he asked why they accused him of blasphemy for claiming to be God's Son and equal to him.       Why is this so hard to understand when the facts are clear? There is no way for just a man to have the authority to forgive sins, judge, give eternal life, etc. The facts are right here, when will you believe?

I see him .. well people that look like him everywhere and its making the whole "getting over your crush" thing alot more difficult then i expected.. people say "if he likes you he would of said so" BUT i was always with my friends and every opportunity he did make an effort but i was joking around and didn't take it seriously.. i ignored him basically.. and this was when i did go to his school.       SO i have his number and i want to call him.. would it be weird if i called him? its his home phone.. sadly he does not have a face book or myspace so calling him is my only option. I also think he tried to contact me because i saw a car that looked like his in my driveway and he rang the doorbell.. i didn't answer cause i was nervous if it actually really turned out to be him.. he hasn't come by since.       but anyways should i call him and IF i do call him what should i say? what if he has a girlfriend or something?? im so nervous i know i have nothing to loose but.. i don't want him to be creeped out.. i guess i was always nervous he would be creeped out even in person lol but ya..       should i? its been a year since i seen him!! i dated this one guy but i kept thinking about him all the time!!      I did run into him recently and we locked eyes.. all the feelings came back to me and I know he felt the same way.. i did walk away though and i hope he didnt take it the wrong way.. it was just to painful to look at him.. hes perfect. HELP PPL!!! its my last chance!
20090220214004AA1wsqC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My gay/partner and I are having major relationship issues.  Where can I turn to for help?	He doesn't seem to pay attention to me lately.  Everything we say to each other turns into an argument.  He doesn't want to have sex with me, but wants to go to porn stores, local parks, and our gay men's club for sex.  When there he acts like a dog in heat.  When I want sex at home, he accuses me of being a sex addict.  He usually dates men that are a lot older than I am.  He is 28, I am 37.  He last partner was 56, and has dated men in their 60s.  Please help; I'm tired of being lonely, and have no place to turn.

20090203093102AA3FiTJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Given the atheist implication that life and liberty are alienable rights, were we wrong at Nuremberg?	Following the logic of atheism, no rights are inalienable; they are the alienable products of human opinion, consensus, or legislative action.  Accordingly, when a Nazi government imposes a contrary view in which life and liberty don't matter, do the atheists say that the victims of Nazism had no rights to lose?  Were the Allies wrong to prosecute the Nazi henchmen for enforcing their ideology through pogroms, given that the rights to life and liberty are alienable and without any greater authority than opinion, consensus, or government?

20090220213155AAM1SP5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Eschatology, why don't we keep it simple? The bible.?	The bible is perfect in its Original Hebrew text, why do people try to come up with there own idea that you need more than one resource to know God, philosophy (Eschatology) goes against the bible and I don't understand the confusion, please read the last chapter of the bible. Revelation 22:18-9 which states:      "For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and [from] the things which are written in this book.      Why do you think we have so many atheists, agnostics and so many other religions, we make it difficult and we are our worst enemies? The bible is 100% true and does not need any other book or person to try to make it better, God provided it to us to live like Jesus did until he returns. which is very soon.

20090220205035AAYywgY	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why do Gay Men get offended hearing the C-S word?	I can't spell it out without it being deleted but the first word is c*ck and the second word is sucker. I ask this not in an intentionally homophobic manner but rather because I don't understand why it is offensive to refer to Gay Men as such when it is a part of their sexual behavior. I mean correct me if Im wrong but homosexuality involves fellatio, right so anyone who participates in fellatio on a man's penis technically is a CS right? I mean by the same logic anyone who participates in fellatio on a woman's vagina is a c-nt eater too and as a Straight Man, I would not be offended to be called one as its part of my sexual behavior. I don't know maybe the CS word to Gay Men is like the N word to Black Men, its something I cant understand as I am not of that origin. I personally just dont see how there can be offense to the CS word and a gay pride parade which celebrates CSing at the same time. But back to my original question, why do gay men get offended being called the CS word, is there a painful history with it or something? I mean I guess I can see why the F-word and Q-word are deragatory but the CS-word, I dont see thats deragatory if its all a part of homosexual activity. Again, I apologize for any offensiveness in this, its just something I don't understand and thats why Im asking the question.

I could understand her offense if she was half something else and I called her white, but she is Italian and is that not in the same area as france, germany, and all those other places in EUROPE?      And, when I asked her why she was so offended she said that white people are corny, (which I find highly generalizing). Do most Italians really see themselves as a more ethnic race, or is she a victim of self hate?

20090220205449AA5JzBg	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	So why didn't Jesus cast the first stone ?	This has been answered before by another poster, but I wanted to add to it.    So if God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are actually one and the same, then that would mean that Jesus actually created the Old Testament laws.      ( Since Jesus " always was " )       If Jesus is somehow separate from God the Father, then that would mean that Jesus is just following the Old Testament God.       Either way, not casting the stone did not change the fact that the original rule was given.        It's strange how that stoning people in society today is considered cruel, yet when " God " says do it, it becomes something right and good.        If a person did some of the things that the O.T. God did, that PERSON  would be considered evil.     How do these actions become condoned simply because they are from  " God ".
20090220205700AAzP5WD	Society & Culture;Languages	Merging Spanish words together?	1) A friend told me that you can merge words together in Spanish, that have vowels on either end of the word, along with the letter "n", so they can be said in one rhythmic flow. For example: Ella es una mujer hermosa.      It this true?      2) Secondly, does this go in accordance with the letter "a" in Spanish? Such as, not only having it sound rhythmically with other vowels, but having the "a" merge into the adjacent word? For example, which would be correct of the two:      Es muy importante para mí a aprender espanol, porque me encanta la cultura hispana y la gente.      Or      Es muy importante para mí aprender espa?ol, porque me encanta la cultura hispana y el gente.      (and feel free to edit it for punctuation!)      Many thanks!

I've always been chubby, and i'm fine with it. but lately there's nothing to do but sit around and eat. My whole family have a social disease and they hate people just as bad as i do. I still have friends from my old school, but we only hang out on weekends, but lately they've all been busy. I hate going to the mall, because everything is so expensive so i can barely get anything. I hate going to the movie theaters...what the hell am i going to do?!   And what's the point even being excited for summer because its only like 3 months then back to school for everyone. and all my friends do have their own lives, and vacations and all that.   Ugh idk what to do anymore.   Oh, and it really doesn't help that my mom doesn't buy healthy food! I tell her to buy more healthier stuff and when she does its just apples and oranges, that's it. I can't live off just oranges and apples while she's sitting beside me eating cupcakes!   GOSH!

Not just African Americans, everyone in general but mostly African Americans. With Latinos I can speak Spanish to them and they can tell by my accent that I am in fact Mexican.    http://i296.photobucket.com/albums/mm192...       African Americans always say "No way, you gotta be Dominican or Puerto Rican" and I know that black Mexicans are really rare because we only account for 1% of Mexico's population and we are all either mixed with Indian or White (Spanish and more rarely French) but that doesn't mean that there aren't any at all.       I made a friend a few years back who was Brazilian and she was Asian and I could really relate to her because people never thought of her as a Brazilian. Why can't people get it through their head that a Nationality is not a race and doesn't not come with a certain look?

20090203091720AApRO2X	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Should I talk to my dad and his boyfriend on the weekend?	If you've read some of my previous questions, you'll know the following;      I am an 18 year old black american male, and my 45 year old black father left my mother for a 24 year old white male. He is still with this man, and met him a few months before he left us. He has been living with him for a couple of months now. It was such a schok, because he is very maculine, and because it seemed like him and my mother had a healthy marriage.      NONE of his friends or family are talking to him. He has tried, but they all refuse. Even his parents wont talk to him, because of what he did to his son (their grandson, me) , and his wife, their daughter in law.      He has been trying to talk to me for weeks, and says he still loves me with all his heart. But I just find it hard to believe he loves me, because he wouldn't have done this to me if he did.      So, he called me yesterday, and left yet another message, saying he would like me and my mother to join him and his boyfriend for lunch on Saturday. He wants to keep being in my life, wants me to meet his boyfriend, and sort out this whole problem.      My mother is a lovely woman, she doesn't deserve this. She said she wants nothing to do with him again, but that whether or not I want to see him (and his boyfriend for that matter) is entirely my choice. She won't be offended if I do. She is neutral on me seeing him.      I am leaning towards going, probaably at the moment, 60/40 in favour of going, but I just know that I'll find it really awkward, seeing that my dad's boyfriend is only 6 years older than me, and is white.      I have nothing against whites, my girlfriend is white. But it just adds more to the situation, if you get what I mean.      So, waht do you think I should do?

I dont know much about Auras and all that but today i was bored in class not really listening. Someone was talking at the front of the class so i was staring at them then i noticed around them was this white thing (might of been see through) in the exact same shape as them. It was sticking out about 3cm maybe more. At first i saw it but moved my eyes then it disappeared. So i concentrsted on them again for about 7 seconds then it gradually appeared again. Sometimes it disappears when i blink and sometimes it stays there. Also i can't see it if someone is moving about they have to be still so i can keep my eyes still and concentrate. I have never noticed it before and it only appears on people and i havent noticed it on objects?????  I heard about Auras are like what i saw today but im not sure if i saw them because i heard there in different colours for each persons emotions/personality.   Another thing is when i do see it on them if they move it follows them and sometimes it will go away.  My question is:  1. Is it an Aura or something up with my eyes?  (i havent had any vision disturbances and it hasnt affected my sight)  2. If it could be a Aura am i only seeing white because im new to it all and will i be able to see colours with practice????  Please tell me what you think!!  Im asking because i really dont know what it is, but like i said im not worried as it isn't affecting my vision. I can see perfect, it only comes if i focus of someone.  - Megan xxxx

One I hear all the time:  "80% of Black women have kids out of wedlock"        lets set the record straight I think the number is more like 60% or so. But it is children born out of wedlock not women having kids out of wedlock.  There is a difference.  2 married women have 1 kid each while 1 single woman has three.  The result is  60% are born out of wedlock. Only 33% had kids out of wedlock. See the difference?   And who is to say the single woman doesn't eventually get married and have a stable family.        That is an example I heard most recently.  But there are many more   First, they quote the statistics wrong, then compound their foolishness by having no idea what the statistic means.

I've often read and heard about an alleged study or studies that claim to "prove" that when hospitalized patients are prayed for, they improve, even if they don't know that they are the objects of prayer.  But, these "studies" are never identified.  Is this claim simply an urban myth?

20090220214954AAdrXuv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is Non-violence an effective tool for struggle?(For indian citizens only)?	Well my question arises from the fact that if non-violence has some power then why krishna participated in Mahabharat. Why rama need to fight a war with Ravana.       But on the other hand Mahatma the great soul showed us an other way. The way of non-violence. His achivements in africa were extraordinary. But is he successful in india. Does he had any impact on hindu muslim minds. India got freedom as british was badly thrashed in wwii. Many other countries under british empire got freedom then. Instead Gandhi's valuesystem as adapted made india a soft state which caused much harm not at the international level but also in the internal administrative working of the nation.  The corrupt officials. Sab chalta hai attitude all are the product of the non-violence baggage we have on our shoulders.

20090220214442AAWSepj	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How often and to what degree is religion used to justify or rationalize bad behavior?	I once heard someone ask the question "Can you repent for a sin before you commit it?"  She was implying that she wanted to do something that she knew was wrong, and was wondering if you could say "sorry" to God beforehand.  The obvious answer to her question was "NO, and you won't be forgiven afterwards either."      Do people use religiosity as some sort of substitute for morality?  Do they attempt to seek forgiveness for things that they have done (and will do) wrong as opposed to not doing those things in the first place?      God wants people to be good.  Nothing religious or spiritual can make up for an evil deed.  As for the forgiveness of sins, only God knows what is forgiven and what isn't, and only he knows the degree to which they are forgiven.

20090220215656AA3GxlS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Should I just move on........................?	Hi there :) There was this guy I went to school with who I became somewhat friends with but more of a classmate/friend kind of thing. We became quite chummy in class...used to joke around with each other..text message etc..but it never progressed to hanging out outside school.(although I am sure it could of) I really began to like him and thought of him often even outside of school. Towards the end of our program I started to keep my distance from him because I was planning on moving out of the city after school and I didn't want to become to attached to him or vice versa. I kind of suspected he might be gay or bi but I found a personal ad with him looking for women and also found out from a classmate that he went out on a date with some girl. I really believe we had some connection and I am sorry "I put walls up" and didn't emerse myself in that possibility. I saw him at grad a few months ago but we never spoke :( When I look back I would have done so many things differently. I am to blame...I am just debating if I should contact him in some way or just move on!! AHH the lessons we learn in life eh? Thanks for reading. I really needed to let this all out :)  P.S His facebook profile has him with a girl out at some bar :(.....I really got the impression that he really liked me...perhaps it was just a friend thing on his end?!?! I am so mixed up over this!!!!

20090220220138AAxTaKG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My boyfriends best friend just recently told me that my b/f is gay but he denies it. What should I do?	My boyfriend had been molested as a child for a couple years by a neighbor boy. he always hangs out with gay guys because "He feels more comfortable around gay guys then straight. His best friend is even gay. He treats his best friend better then me. I always feel second best and he says its cause he's known him for 7 years and they are like brothers. Well we got into a fight on new years and his best friend told me that he is gay and he just got with me cause he needed someone to love. My boyfriend denied it and when he confronted his friend he also denied saying that. Now we are broken up because he has "lots of mental issues and he needs help and to get healthy before he can be with me" He's still best friends with that guy even though he lost me. What should I do. Is he gay or is he just confused?
