20090220165724AAMX0fb	Environment;Conservation	How do you become a Wildlife Conservationist?	I first wanted to be a biologist, then a warden, then a forester, etc.   What I REALLY want to do is conserve wildlife and their habitat, and spend almost all of my time out in the woods.   Any ideas about what that job would be?  Is it even a Wildlife Conservationist?   I don't wanna be a Biologist because I don't wanna study animals in a lab.   Intelligent Answers are appreciated.

I know aluminium is easier to recycle than plastic, so when I buy soft drinks should I buy a case of the drinks in the cans or should I buy my drinks in the large plastic bottles?  Where I live they don't sell drinks in glass bottles, it's too bad that would be the best option i'm sure.

20090220170834AABebHU	Environment;Global Warming	What factors contributed to the sudden climate stabilization that ushered in the Holocene epoch?	Evidence from glacial ice cores, ocean sediments, and peat bog deposits suggests that, up until circa 11,000 years ago, the world's climate systems fluctuated chaotically. Then, dramatically, the reign of chaos ended and a new era of moderation began, one that many anthropologists believe enabled Neolithic humans to settle down, develop agriculture and, eventually, found the first cities.      Physics teaches us that chaotic systems do not spontaneously right themselves into regular ones, and that it usually takes deliberate application of force to normalize a chaotic system and to keep it normal. What kinds of forces contributed to this 'amazing' transition? Are we living through an unstable equilibrium, a delicate state which at any moment can revert back to the sound and the fury of the Pleistocene?

I'm doing a little research on the car exhaust engine...

20090220201755AAxSuaG	Environment;Global Warming	Arctic Ice Measurements Are Found to Be Incorrect. How Much More Data Is Inaccurate?	Arctic Ice Measurements are now found to be incorrect.  There is much more ice at the poles now then what scientists consider average.       http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...       Last years monthly data was found to be incorrect, as was the infamous "Hockey Stick".  In fact, many errors were discovered in time with the global warming data.  All errors were in favor of the believers side of the story.      How much more data is incorrect?      How much of "Global Warming" is based on faulty data?      Should the "Global Warming" data be reviewed by independent sources to determine just what data is usable?      Is "Global Warming" just a science built on faulty data?
