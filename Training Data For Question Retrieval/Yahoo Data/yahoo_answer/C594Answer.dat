hwIMJBVpaa	i thought that was normal until i asked someone and they told me they only do it once every 2-3 days...i think going 3 times a day would be way healthier. its not good to keep all that waste in your body for that long.|`|QU37MZi7aa	i does 2~3times a day with normal discharge. so no problem. it's excreting the waste inside the body. better than having constipation or LBM that makes your body worst.|`|AA10453678	if he eats enough, yeah.|`|EUxS8IMiaa	i wiould say the common person doesn't but i have seen through various sources that you should take a poop 2-4 times a day.

JEXiKUmGaa	If you want to remove a mole at home the right way, I highly recommend using Dermatend. I didn't want to have surgery, and looked into other options available. Dermatend seemed to be the best natural mole remover on the market, plus it comes with a 100% guarantee, so if it doesn't work you can send it back.    I removed one of my moles in 5 days, right from home. If it worked for me it should work for you, my moles had been on my body my whole life. I ended up buying from www.mole-wartremoval.com, take care.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	never do that. those things can have veins and other things inside them. dont do it, some can cause severe bleeding if taken off the wrong way. you need someone qualified to remove it. go to a dermatologist.|`|AA10112346	No. see a doctor.|`|AA10453678	there is that freeze off stuff you can get for warts. you could try that.|`|AA11117952	Well, I have the tendency to poke at my skin, too. You can get a serious infection if you cut it off yourself though. Plus, true moles have "roots." I had two on my neck and had them removed at 25 by my family doctor right in his office. He numbed the area, cut them out with a scalpel, and stitched it. It was pretty barbaric and I have two obvious scars which were "supposed" to go away. I suggest seeing a dermatologist and asking about laser removal.|`|4U9DH6KGaa	moel and wart ez clear|`|FmAse7pUaa	You should just go to a doctor, mole removal, if done incorrectly, can lead to some really nasty and potentially severe infections.|`|JQarjZBDaa	nooope i have a mole on my face and i liiiiiike it!
dVJ3F6YFaa	Asperger's Disorder and Autism are two different disorders.  Both are forms of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD).  The main difference is in the area of language.  An individual can have higher functioning Autism or they can have Asperger's Disorder.  For more detailed information about the traits of each form of PDD and what to look for in a quality diagnosis, check out this article, http://www.ehow.com/how_4723735_autism-a...|`|WsbsPi1Oaa	I suppose that "highly functional autism" is one way to describe it. Here's an article that should help:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asberger%27...|`|Ms72jNbBaa	Maybe that's as good a short definition as any.  www.aspergers.com calls it "a milder variant of Autistic Disorder."  I do know someone who has Asperger's, and she is indeed highly functional.  She is very smart about local history and the families that have been established here for a long time, and she knows all kinds of trivia.  At the same time, it's hard for her to be truly empathetic with others.  Her own feelings are very sensitive and absorbing to her.  She doesn't realize when she is talking too loudly and disturbing others.  And she rather quickly gets "peopled out" and needs to leave the gathering.  She doesn't like to be touched unless she initiates it, and then the touch is perfunctory.  However, she likes to undress partially in the ladies' room, pull up her skirt in public, and talk about her body functions.  She tends to be too warm, but she wears a knit wool hat with long flaps that cover her ears.  She is often generous about contributing her time, but fritters out before the mission is accomplished.  She is highly judgmental of others and assumes everybody else ("who is Anybody") shares her views.  She has a hard time controlling her impulses, and her craving for sodas and sweets have made her really quite overweight and borderline diabetic.  You gotta love her, though she can be most annoying.  And she expects that - she presumes that others are there for her benefit.    There may be some other diagnoses represented in her persona, but she got a book from the library and identified herself as having Asperger's!

Pain relief may require the use of narcotics and antivenin (antitoxin to counteract the effects of the spider venom).     The decision to seek emergency care should be made early. If the person who was bitten by a black widow spider has more than minor pain or has whole-body symptoms, seek care at a hospital's Emergency Department.

L6ZEQxvLaa	well there is not another option.    
1tQef9edaa	I am pretty sure this is normal. All breast have little lumps and bumps. Get firmilar with them (the bumps) just monitor them. If they change (get bigger, harder) or even start hurting really bad. This is when you should see a doc. Also, caffeine and your period can effect these bumps. So try not to drink so much caffeine if they are sore.|`|aEF55nBuaa	the breast tissue normally feels "knotty".... but if you feel a defined lump... kind of like a marble under the skin definately go get it checked out. Especially if breast cancer runs in your family. Don't be worried... just have it checked out.|`|j5U44juiaa	Yes I have that too, if it is just a bunch of little lumps, then they're cysts.  You can get them from drinking a lot of caffiene or eating a lot of salt, because it causes you to retain water.  But just to be sure, I would go see a doctor!
2mkECIheaa	So ballet class works on flexibility, I would assume.  Because that's the biggest drwback of running is you really have to concentrate of stretching after running to maintain flexibility, etc of you calves, hamstrings, etc.  3 times is plenty.  Slow and a little longer will set your body to burn more calories after you're off the treadmill, after running.      hydrate, easy warm-up, easy stretch. slow run warm-up, go at it hard, cool down, stretch, hydrate, sleep, and you're all over it.  Best to vary your runs.  Mix in some hills on the treadmill, short distance sprints, long runs, etc.   That'll fully develop your running body.  Enjoy, nothing like when you get that "second breath".....it's better than you know what.|`|9XigdRoiaa	Windows Mojave is really windows vista!|`|T4tM4NWKaa	i think that is plenty. but if u r looking for better results then u should do more.|`|HGdQp8QBaa	Yes, that's enough!! Do you want to be anorexic?! ( lol )|`|bi9EsTReaa	yes very|`|6HAPOiDWaa	100 meter run on the track|`|tc4ajmgGaa	Yeah you need cardiovascular workouts AT LEAST 3 times a week to get the training affect. I'd say 4 times a week is the perfect amount.     Don't overdo it though, there's much evidence that excess exercise actually ages your body faster.     And with running, you can get shin splints, blow out your knees, and there's many other risks involved. I'd recommend biking or mountain biking, as it's a much smoother motion, not just repeated pounding on the ground like running. And since you're a girl you're not at risk for developing prostate problems from biking.     If you're going to continue running though, just make sure you have proper shoes and make sure your heel hits the ground first, and then toe, on each stride. Remember, "heel, toe, heel, toe."     And don't drink anything carbonated like soda, since that severely weakens your bones and causes major knee problems for runners.     If you're really serious about working out, do some research on the risks involved. And remember, don't overdo it. Good luck.|`|sipXnwifaa	Try to run long distance some days, and then do win sprints on the other days, itll help train you and keep you in better shape and raise endurance|`|PeCm21meaa	yes! of course it is, you exercise all the time!  you need to stop worrying so much, you are obviously incredibly fit, and very, very thin!|`|pOLBKKNpaa	yes, you are physically fit    don't overtrain to the point of injury|`|tRYKdk6Saa	Yep. That's definitely enough. Or, you could run a little over a mile every day.|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	it might be. but really it also depends on your diet. if your running long distance 3 times a week then when you get back from the run and you stuff your face with mcdonalds its not going to help. you have to keep a strict diet or try to keep fatty and greasy foods out of your diet. also try not to drink soda drink water and juice.

2sycPf8Daa	Normal heart rate increase as response to various situations:If you are experiencing fear, anxiety or stress, your heart rate will increase.  People who can feel their heartbeat, or flutter, may be experiencing palpitations. This may be due to stress, anxiety, worry.medications, or it may be a sign of a serious heart condition.     Why heart rate increase when sitting down? When you are sitting  down your legs and head are dis-level  to your heart so you heart works a little harder to pump blood up to your brain and has to pump blood out with even more pressure to be able to get it to your legs and head. This is why you get light headed when you are sitting and stand all of a sudden because when you are sitting your blood tends to pool up in your legs and standing all of a sudden sends a sudden huge burst of a lot of blood to your brain. Your brain gets a little oxygen starved when you are sitting. The reason it does this is to return the majority, deoxygenated blood that is in your veins to your heart so it can travel to your lungs, pick up oxygen, and travel the muscles so they can contract/move.  Why heart rate increase when sitting down? Your brain gets a little oxygen starved when you are sitting.You heart works a little harder to pump blood up.I am not a doctor.I suggest encouraging yourself to be more open about your symptoms to your doctor.     Take care as always.|`|O8zOZzO6aa	It's not just sitting down alone that can increase the heartbeat. It depends on the state of your mind. You could sit down and worry or think about some serious matter that concerns you or your family. That can increase the heartbeat. So, it all depends on the state of the mind.

It's an impulse control disorder.  You say you pick your skin more often now but really the two aren't different because the impulse to do each is probably the coming from the same place. As far as trying to stop? You could try medication for your OCD of course and that can help but if your hair pulling and skin picking is more out of habit you might want to try your own "habit reversal training". It's the same thing doctors try to do with thumb suckers and nail biters. Sounds like an easy concept but there is more to it. First you have to be aware of the impulsive problem. There are probably times when you realize you are pulling or picking but I bet there are many other times where you don't realize you are even doing it. Train yourself to become aware of it at all times. The rest goes into a lot of detail and there is a good amount of information online for you to try it for yourself. But if you want to get help and therapist can also monitor your therapy. I wish I could give you an answer that was easy enough but this is something that takes a lot of work. It won't be easy just like breaking an addiction isn't easy. Be prepared to mess up but don't get down on yourself for it. And remember the prize at the end - you don't want to have scars on your face and bald spots on your head! It'll be worth it.    Here are some helpful links:    http://westsuffolkpsych.homestead.com/tr...  http://www.brainphysics.com/skin-picking...  http://www.trich.org/  http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section...  And you can always do your own research on the web or at a library with these terms:    -Trichotillomania  -Dermatillomania  -Impulse Control  -Habit Reversal Training  -Cognitive Therapy  -Behavior Therapy  -Behavior Modification  -Obsessions  -Compulsions  -Intrusive thoughts      Good luck!|`|AA11462298	You sound EXACTLY like me. I also, had OCD and the hair pulling problem. It's been since 4th grade and i'm in 9th grade.  Sadly, I haven't found a good way to stop. I'm sorry
oheJaFsPaa	i've been feeling the same way recently. what i would recommend is going on a 1-2 day (but no linger) liquid fast. so for breakie have a smoothie, than some tea or coffee, juice, chocolate milk, soup and lots of water. personally, i wouldnt want to starve myself completely on a fast so i think just taking in liquids for a few days is better. it will help unclog your body and rid it of toxins and assist greatly in elimination :)

cDhOPpWfaa	It must be one of those old wives tales that the older generation passed on.  However, you can do all of those things, although waxing isn't recommended.  You can swim though because using a tampon allows you to!  If you mom wants to partake in these old wives tales by all means let her do so, but if you don't feel the need to believe in them you don't have to!|`|tFoSy2YRaa	How weird!  These must be some old fashioned myths about periods - they're all rubbish. Why wouldn't you shower? Ugh.

Is it a religious thing?|`|zBpj9jCfaa	lol, your mom is crazy.    you can do all of these things on your period. theres nothing wrong with any of them.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	She told you not to SHOWER? That's the one thing you would need to do the most when you're on your period. She must want you to smell. I eat icecream all the time when I'm on my period, I actually always crave it. As for the wearing tampons.. if you're younger than I could understand why she would say that because you wouldn't know how to put them in.  If you want to wear tampons just buy them yourself.. just make sure you look at the directions and you put them in correctly. Change them regularly, because it's dangerous to leave them in for so long.. it could cause Toxic Shock Syndrome... it's a bacteria infection. Just have a long talk with your mother and tell her that you are ready to be wearing tampons. If your periods aren't heavy enough I don't suggest wearing them - it will hurt.|`|F2ishnWOaa	Those are just taboo beliefs. They're not scientifically supported beliefs. If you don't shower on your period, you'll definitely stink... and you don't want that.    The citrus fruits and ice cream is believed to either stop the flow or make you have large blobs of blood. Of course, that's not true.|`|378GRzrnaa	I dont know but you can shower.. and wear tampons and if you wear tampons you can go swimming|`|XgwGxdb3aa	what the eff?! why the hell does she say that?! i dont know what the hell is wrong with your mom but ask her why she wont let you eat ice cream or use tampons on your period. its not like she doesnt wear them. what an idiot. no offense but. UG!    and ask her the fck y the fck she doesnt let you fcking shower! WTDF!    and i agree. you dont have to let her know you eat ice cream or wear tampons. its not like shell stick her head in your vagina to see if you are wearing a tampon and if she does. flip her off and tell her shes an idiot and tell he youll be carefull with it. tell her your not a little girl anymore and tell her to get out of your life and stop controlling it cuz you are big enough to make your own decision.    your moms stupid. she doesnt know what a teenager is. and how and f u c k is showering BAD for your health. ???

When other time would you wear a tampon except for when your are on your period. The not showering thing is very unhygienic, and unhealthy. All of these "rules" are ridiculous. How old are you? You need to tell her how unhealthy these rules are.|`|ky9uJSHPaa	umm.  well the shower thing: you have a higher risk of a yeast infection. tell her that. because honestly, that is disgusting if you don't shower !|`|x2yOj2Smaa	cause your mom is retarted just wear em anyways **** it|`|CGwdcAR4aa	wow that sounds really messed up. the tampon thing could be because she doesnt want you to develop TSS (toxic shock syndrome) which can result in wearing tampons that are too big or for longer than 4-6hrs. Hitting any type of water during your period will stop blood flow but it isnt unsafe. I think you should do what you feel is best and forget your mom's superstitions.|`|aEF55nBuaa	No disrespect to your mother, but I think you may want to speak with a nurse or a GYN doctor about these issues... maybe even take your mother. I am guessing that she doesn't mean you can't shower... but doesn't want you to take a bath. Bathing can at times cause an infection.... but there is nothing wrong with showering. Tampons have been known to cause illness if left in for too long... she may be concerned about that. Learn as much as you can about this by reading and asking questions... then try to show your mother that you are taking a valid interest in your health.... she may give you more freedom then.     hope this helps!|`|dc984b1152e1c34c8bdc149deb4dfc98aa	just to let you know:    there were NO tampons in your moms moms moms moms moms day, or possibly even in your grandma's day!  so, i'd check em on that one!    2nd: eat whatever you want and tell them to mind they own business cause they just jealous cause theys pausin.    nextly: the shower thing does not make any kinds of sense. . .i mean, drippitty drip drip versus everywhere in the tub?  come on, now. easy choice!    tell your mom and her mom and so on that they need to get with the times.

They are all moisturizers, no scrubbers! But they work great! One thing that you can always do though is just use a hot wash clothe and just dab at your face 2 times a day. Hope this helps!|`|DdutX2hhaa	There are many medical treatments for acne, although unfortunately, it can not be said that there is any one, single treatment to cure acne.     Rather than having a single treatment for acne, doctors generally have to try several different products for each individual before finding the treatment or combination of treatments that will clear up the problem.    Every case of acne is different and will do different things to the skin depending on the individual. This makes acne quite a difficult condition to treat. A lot of experimentation and trial and error with various medications is usually needed before a successful treatment is found. This can be very frustrating for the person that wants a quick-fix solution to their problem or even for those individuals that have a stubborn strain of acne that takes a long time to clear up.

5ogk3fylaa	My dear, I think your question is very valid and I also feel that you are not getting the answers you deserve!. Let me try to respond in a nice informed way about this.    To me, this clearly points down to an issue with an important old-male figure, in this case: your father (I'm sorry to say). I know its terrible to distrust your loved ones, but REMEMBER: not everybody in your family of origin is "nice" or "wants the best for you".     There are many, many cases when people result in being hurt by those who are closest to them. Think about all those cases of rape and incest that CAN happen within families. Or all those children that are constantly abused.    So... our parents shape, very subcounsciously, the image we have of people in the world. To a certain extent: "the way my parents are is how I would expect other people to be". This is VERY normal and part of every person's psyche.    My guess is that if you FEEL growse wearing certain clothes in front of your dad, then guess what... maybe he IS looking to you in a certain way. AND it is HIS fault, NOT yours. So my advice for you is to take things with calm, and try to talk to a therapist about this... (choose a woman, so that you won't feel disturbed by the proximity and intimacy levels that people achieve with their therapists).    Solving this problem (that is, the way you see things in your mind, i.e. that older man are constantly "checking you out" as "fresh meat") will take probably years of psychoanalysis. But it will be worth it, specially considering that you are still at young age and have a lot of dating to do yet.     I'm sorry this answer is not all "sweet and pears" my darling but someone has to tell the (sometimes) harsh truth. I wouldn't advice talking to your mother about this, because she will feel disgusted about this and, (since this would attack her own esteem), probably won't believe you (yes, parents are human beings too, most of them full of flaws and defects).    Good luck and NEVER believe other people that try to prove you wrong!. Remember: if YOU feel it, it IS important enough!.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	Yea you probably get checked out by older guys all the time and it's natural to feel more comfortable around guys your age.    But don't worry about your dad, he's not going to be thinking about you.... like that.    I think you are contemptuous though, and assume we guys are a monolith.

Assuming that all older men are looking at you and desiring you? I think the answer is to take your focus off of yourself. This may help.|`|d3VV4b6vaa	well you should be feeling this way!  It will better prepare you for the world. no, not all men are hungry for 15yr olds, but A LOT are. from experience I know this.

Diet: Eat more vegetables, lean meat, and fruits. Avoid fried foods, sweets (candy, soda, etc.), and carbs before going to sleep. (Carbs are used as immediate energy. If unused, the carbs then become sugar, then stored as fat.) Oh, and drink lots of water.    Exercise: Focus mostly on cardiovascular exercises to shed unwanted fat, and lift lighter weights at higher repetitions to tone your muscle. Use weights to focus on specific muscle groups that you intend to tone. Ideally, swimming would be great, as the resistance of movement in water helps you build lean muscle and burn calories at the same time.

You also record your daily weight and it gives you a chart.  I find that recording calories keeps me conscious of what I am eating and keeps me busy.  I am one of those people that eat when I am bored.    I try to eat a lot of foods with low fat calories and I watch my portions.  I eat small amounts so that my body can burn the calories and eat more times a day.  I cut out my soda intake and sweets.  Not fun, but it works. Also, grapefruit, yogurt and celery are your friends.  Grapefruit, for example takes more energy to burn than the calories that are in it.      This site is interesting:  http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0...|`|d8jH5lU1aa	run run run girl at least a hour a day oh and eat healthy|`|4RL0GLtJaa	eat healthy food and go jogging|`|gHR4vlcDaa	eat lots of chicken, fish, salad and vegies, do squats, crunches, and light weight lifting|`|RWEyZZXWaa	Well, you could try watching what you eat and excercise.

4HQxLXQCaa	Crunches are an abdominal exercise.  They work the abdominal muscle.  Look at my source for an example and a complete list of muscles exercised.    They are highly overrated because the fitness industry has convinced the public doing crunches can get rid of stomach fat.  It's can't.  All crunches do is exercise the abdominal muscle, nothing more.  The fat stays in the same place.  You cannot get a six pack, get rid of love handles, or remove the "pooch" by doing any crunches or other abdominal workout.    The "burn" that is commonly felt is not fat burn but actually a buildup of lactic acid in the muscles.  This occurs naturally when muscles become fatigued.    If you want a thinner waist, you need to hop on the treadmill, not the ab crunch machine.|`|4GH9oDbiaa	they work your abs and are like mini sit ups. you put your hands behind your head and come up only a little bit|`|0YO1WFMWaa	Crunches work 6 of the main 8 muscles in the abs    A crunch is pretty much a mini- sit up   you get down in a sit up position and go half way (just enough to get your shoulder blades off of the ground)    then go back down and repeat    simple|`|6LtmIxhCaa	Sit Ups.

ETcBRko3aa	Here are some choices:    1) Social workers who work for social services as caseworkers for kids in foster care. The majority of kids in foster care have been abused or neglected. They kids are all ages, all races, and from all "walks of life."  As a caseworker, you would meet with the kids, try and help them get a stable placement, goto court, document what is happening in their foster homes or group homes, etc.    It is a really hard job and alot of people burn out, because the kids are hurt and it can get sad and overwhelming.    2) A child psychologist who works for the state or in a clinic where foster children would be seen. Your job here would be to help the children work through their abuse issues. Kids usually have therapy that is play therapy or imagery therapy or sandplay therapy. Child's therapy has different techniques than adult therapy. You would learn these in college.    3) Teacher at a group home where foster children live. Some of the LARGE group homes or "orphanages" have their own schools and hire their own teachers.|`|4EZis4lWaa	psychotherapist|`|ddrRl2tJaa	not sure if you are asking because you are the one who has been abused (sorry to say that but different answer for an abused person)  if you have not experienced something or someone you know it is a pretty stress full occupation to get into.

uqRb9tAqaa	No, you're just strong and athletic. You might be big boned, curvy, strong, all that. But not overweight. You shouldn't listen to your brother, or change your weight or self esteem because of what some one else says. But, if you want to change your body a bit, here are some tips. You already work out a ton, and do so many sports so you probably have a lot of muscle, and that's why you're heavier. So don't focus on actually losing numbers on the scale. Just make sure you're eating healthy. Lot's of water, protein, fruits, and veggies. Not too much dessert, candy, soda, ect. Don't eat late at night, etc. And if you want more tips you can message me.    xoxo|`|764cf8bcce5b69aa33ca2c53123cdf3daa	Not a good idea, more like 10 lbs in a month.

What you can do is to cut down on your sugar,oil/fat and refined food intake and increase your fiber intake by including whole grains,legumes and vegetables. Drink at least 10-12 glasses(the same for everyone)of water/day.|`|85vaWQebaa	Unless you're dehydrated, no, because it would have to thin your blood to do that, which it doesn't.

8891f12e3b80bcc7c7aec7f94acdb8ccaa	No the doctor won't notice anything if you don't tell him. Unless the problem is a physical deformity (which in that case dr. would have noticed by now), they will have to run some tests to look for what's wrong.     You should tell the doctor at the earliest possible opportunity, like now if you can call him. I know it is difficult to talk about these subjects, but if it helps, doctors are trained in this stuff and there's probably nothing you have that your dr. hasn't seen before.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	At 17, you really should see a doctor about this, it should be happening 3 years into puberty.

Like 30 mins strait. Watch porn when no one is around and try to go for a few hours.|`|RaEEhFoTaa	Obviously because you started puberty at a later time, you should be able to ejaculate soon,it's all down to the hormones - they decide what happens next! Don't be afraid to tell your doctor about it, they are perfectly understandable and they would NOT be able to tell from looking at it, it isn't physically visible obviously. Don't panic your self! If worst comes to worst consult your doctor on possible methods of ejaculation or erectile problems. Nothing to be embarrassed about, many others suffer the same problem!    Hope this helps :) Jake

SQf0M6wBaa	Be careful! Vicodin that you take is 5mg hydrocodone and 500mg of tylenol. That`s what I know off the top of my head. I do not know how much tylenol that the brand,Norco contains.Tylenol toxicity is a serious issue that can cause liver failure.Please see if there are any options to help to lessen the need for so much narcotics.Sorry about your suffering.|`|d2RV8HTmaa	The reason most docs prescribe Norco is because while they have a stronger dose of hydrocodone (usually 10mg as compared with 5 or 7.5mg in Vicodin) and because they have less acetamenophen (or Tylenol..Norco has 325mg acetamenophen and Vicodin has 500mg or more).  So Norco is less toxic on the liver.|`|d5RXOfyyaa	Yes, of course. You take what is prescribed and ALWAYS try to get by with less.

But my guess is, if you're young and you just started recently or you've had it for at least a year or two, then it's your body's way of readjusting to the changes. If you've had it longer than that, then it could be something else.....and if it is something else, you might want to go to the doc. But I'm sure everything is alright.|`|aL8Pj3dtaa	Nothing, mine done that before but it was heavier on the next.  I don't have one any more and i am 16.

There is NO CURE for Type 1 Diabetes, only treatment.    T2 can be dialed back for many people with diet and weight issues, but NO CURE for many other reasons for T2 like PCOS.    I will answer for Type 1 first:    It is an autoimmune disease that is passed from parent to child on several genes, most notably:      About 10 loci in the human genome have now been found that seem to confer susceptibility to Type I diabetes. Among these are (1) a gene at the locus IDDM2 on chromosome 11 and (2) the gene for glucokinase (GCK), an enzyme that is key to glucose metabolism which helps modulate insulin secretion, on chromosome 7.     In a nut shell, the b cells of the pancreas are damaged and die as a result of attack by the immune system of the patient. The B cells are responsible for creating insulin, therefor as the b cells die off, the patient must add insulin by injection or pump.      T2:    Is a metabolic disorder, caused by insulin resistance in a person created by too many fat cells, PCOS, damage to the pancreas or liver, or other disease process. T2 is treated by insulin sometimes, but more likely by diet and glucophage to enhance insulin sensitivity.    IMPORTANT:    You can develop T2 from bad eating and obesity, but NO eating sugar does NOT cause EITHER type of Diabetes. Period.     Sugar is important as an energy source to your cells. Eating smart for any disease process you have (cancer, thyroid, diabetes) will help your body fight off bad stuff and help the patient to feel good. Moderation is key here.

Guys, get those chisled abs and have the girls go wild!    Six pack abs are usually developed initially through indirect stimulus. These exercises include squatting, dead lifting, overhead pressing, pull-ups, dynamic rows, and bench press. Six pack abs are the sculpted muscles of the abdominal region. Only a good diet will result in the look you desire. Six pack abs are compacted and the buttocks gathered under to correct the angle of the pelvis.    Six pack abs are obtained in two parts.    First part is diet and it?s best to eat low sugars and many small meals. Six pack abs are in big demand right now. However, in terms of attaining a six pack of abs in relation to building a bigger chest, sculpting your abs takes a little more work, education, and discipline. Six pack abs are heavily commercialized these days through movies and ads, and everyone would like to have one. Hence the search volume on Google is high on these search terms.    The second one is desire and discipline.|`|7pkxOc6Raa	I recommend punching yourself in the face a few times, personally.|`|4HQxLXQCaa	Any lady that you can't get without abs but you can get with abs is a whore and you should not be associated with her.  Most women don't give a crap about your abs.  It's all personality.    That said, if you still want a six pack, you need to lose fat.  I couldn't imagine you would need to lose more than 5 pounds max if you can see the first 4.  Fyi, crunches are useless, they don't get rid of fat covering your abs.    Eat just a little bit less and exercise a bit more.
aDDZu9bPaa	Side stitches are fairly common when you start running. No one knows why they occur, but there are some things you can do to minimize them. One cause is running before you've completely digested a meal, which may cause stomach cramps. Wait 2 to 4 hours after a large meal before running. Side stitches can also be caused by weak stomach muscles. Your abs do a lot of work to keep your body in position while you're running. Doing consistent ab and lower back exercises will help strengthen your torso and reduce those stitches. If you get a side stitch while running, slow down to a walk and try holding your hands up in the air as you take deep breaths. Sometimes pressing into the cramp and massaging it can help, too.|`|4HQxLXQCaa	Those are "side stitches".  They are painful muscle contractions that result when you are exerting your body a lot.  It happens usually when you aren't in shape.  If you get this, slow down to a walk, then find a tree and stretch out your sides.  Remember to breath deep when you work out.  As you get healthier, you will get these less and less often.|`|3b4aee778c641761c667e4939d750c02aa	Well I get it too but I don't run that much, however, u can do sit ups, That might help.|`|780ByZVEaa	means normally you are dehydrated

Lots of water as well.|`|PrS7So5Yaa	It looks as if you may be cutting calories too much. Calculate your BMR and make sure you eat that many calories, plus the number you burn during exercise. You never want your calorie surplus (calories you eat minus calories you burn during exercise) to go below your BMR.    Dinner is absolutely ok, considering you're getting enough calories.    Besides, depriving yourself is a sure way to sabotage yourself in the long run.|`|9Jnrhm8Yaa	Yes that's fine.   You'll still lose fat, don't worry about it.

bDUbJ7aAaa	Hi! I take dance so I can help you with this. Ok first yes, stretching everyday and trying to reach your toes does help. Also if you stand facing a wall, put your hands on the wall and step back as far as you can (while pushing the wall) by trying to keep your heels on the ground, you'll feel a stretch in ur calf. Do those 2 things everyday and hold them for atleast 30 seconds each! Then as you go on in the days hold it a little longer and reach a little further. Im not sure how long it will take but it will deffinately help!|`|Mf2f7uU9aa	practice by putting your feet behind your head,, if I can do it so can you|`|wuXzDUGQaa	You could try out yoga.|`|zf4phBrCaa	try out doing yogas

AA11096432	It is called Master Cleanse<br>  <br>  The Master Cleanser detox diet was created by Stanley Burroughs in 1941. The Master Cleanser also goes by the name "Master Cleanse" and "Lemonade Diet".<br>  <br>  The Master Cleanser involves drinking a mixture of fresh lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and grade B maple syrup. Some people choose to take a laxative while on the Master Cleanser, but no solid food is eaten while on the cleanse. The typical amount of time spent on the Master Cleanser is ten days, although it is not uncommon for people to stay on the cleanse for longer periods of time.<br>  <br>  To make the Master Cleanser, take 10 oz of water, add 2 tablespoons of maple syrup, 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon or lime juice and a pinch of ground cayenne pepper.<br>  <br>  The Master Cleanser is said to eliminate waste that has built up in our body. Supporters of the Master Cleanser have credited it with helping them lose weight, increase energy, and even cure chronic diseases. Those who oppose the Master Cleanser suggest that it is too restrictive and unhealthy. This is not unwarranted. The Master Cleanser when followed contains far less than the recommended amount of daily calories to sustain a healthy person. It also lacks protein, which is vital to many bodily functions.|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	Here's the link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032633/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032633/</a>

They also reduce the risk of Parkinsons disease, relieve schizophrenia, boost your brain cells, speed up your thinking, improve your reactions and increase your working efficiency.    Pay no attention to those lung cancer warnings - theyre nonsense. Youre more likely to get cancer from cooking smoke! Those are the words of wisdom from Chinas state-owned tobacco monopoly, the worlds most successful cigarette-marketing agency. With annual sales of 1.8 trillion cigarettes, the Chinese are responsible for nearly 1/3 of all cigarettes smoked on the whole planet.    The official website of the tobacco monopoly claims cigarettes are a kind of miracle drug: solving your health problems, helping your lifestyle, strengthening the equality of women, and even eliminating loneliness and depression. Smoking removes your troubles and worries, says a 37-year-old female magazine editor, quoted approvingly on the website. Holding a cigarette is like having a walking stick in your hand, giving you support. Quitting smoking would bring you misery, shortening your life. Such statements are widely believed in China.    2/3 of Chinese men are smokers, and surveys show that approx. 90% believe their habit has little effect on their health, or is good for them. Even in Chinas medical community, 60% of male doctors are smokers. No wonder Western tobacco companies are drooling over the Chinese market of 360 million smokers.    This week, a group of Canadian experts went to China in an effort to convince Chinese smokers of more realistic effects of smoking. They distributed anti-smoking posters, visited cancer patients, showed the graphic warnings on Canadian cigarette packs, and lectured on how the anti-smoking campaign has reduced Canadas lung-cancer rate. They face a struggle in China, a country where the tobacco industry provides 60 million jobs and 10% of national tax revenue.    In China today, the economy comes first and everything else is secondary, including health care, Dr. Jean Couture, a Quebec surgeon, said. You wonder if anyone in the government is conscious of how great the smoking problem is. Theres no public education program. The Chinese anti-smoking association is very weak and has almost no money. Within 20 years, China could have the majority of all smoking deaths in the world. Couture leads anti-smoking campaigns in 4 Chinese provinces, and has been involved with Chinas smoking problem since 1990.    As Canadians distributed posters at a hospital, they saw a number of people smoking in the hospital. A hospital shop was openly selling cigarettes. While smoking rates have fallen sharply in Canada in the past two decades, the rate in China is still rising. The number of Chinese smokers is growing by 3 million a year, despite an estimated 1.3 million tobacco-related deaths annually.    Chinese cigarettes are cheap  as little as 30 cents a pack  and the health warnings are hidden in small print on the sides of the packages. Though cigarette advertising is technically illegal, tobacco companies are allowed to promote their corporate names. Children can easily buy cigarettes at Chinese shops, despite an official ban on sales to those under 18.

If you have only just started taking the pill then it is normal to miss a period or have it show up late. And of course sometimes you will miss it even if you have been on the pill for years. If you keep missing them and it worries you then you should pay a visit to your doctor. You may need to switch to another brand.
68d13f7e388e7e85d5315a6142111ac1aa	At some time or other, most guys experience premature ejaculation, which means that they ejaculate before they want to. They can't control their response to the stimulation that triggers ejaculation. This is also called early ejaculation. Up to 35 percent of young men experience early ejaculation so often that they see it as a problem.<br>  <br>  Being very excited, fear and anxiety about sex, alcohol and drug use, and depression may cause early ejaculation. Open communication with a partner about likes and dislikes, and paying attention to sensation — to slow down the process of getting to the point of ejaculatory inevitability — during sex play can help guys delay ejaculation.<br>  <br>  Men who seek sex therapy for early ejaculation are taught the "squeeze technique." The partner brings the man to erection, but squeezes the penis just below the glans with thumb and forefinger just before the time when ejaculation would become inevitable. The partner applies pressure until the erection is reduced by 10-30 percent. The penis is released for about 30 seconds before it is brought to erection again. This procedure is repeated until the man can go for 15-20 minutes before ejaculating. When he can postpone ejaculation, he is allowed to have intercourse again.<br>  <br>  Other men have tried Extended Pleasure condoms by Trojan or Permorax condoms by Durex. These condoms are coated with a mild anesthetic on the inside that desensitizes the penis and helps a guy last longer.|`|AA12200754	what really works:<br>  1 ask your doctor to prescibe an anti-depressant for you.  there are several brands available that delay the early release of your little guys.<br>  2. try masturbating yourself an hour or so before you plan to have partnered sex.  this recovery time will serve to delay the completion of the act.|`|0fe9d26d3ab113994eb89efb591a21f2aa	A normal ejaculation occurs when sexual excitement triggers glands, located inside your body, to begin a slow release of chemicals (hormones) into your blood stream. The slow release of these hormones tells your brain to gently stimulate the nerves at the glans (head of your penis). As you become more and more sexually excited, your body produces more and more of these hormones. The sensitivity becomes greater and greater until you reach the point at which time you ejaculate. Under normal circumstances the production of hormone is gradual and a man has the ability to control the sensations of sex.<br>  <br>  Premature Ejaculation occurs when your body produces too much hormone too fast. Your body becomes "over stimulated". The head of the penis becomes so sensitive that you ejaculate almost immediately. There is absolutely no control.<br>  <br>  This Extreme Sensitivity on the head of your penis causes the ejaculatory mechanism, inside your body, to go into "spasms". It's these spasms that cause the overpowering Urge to Ejaculate. The head of your penis becomes so sensitive and the urge is so strong that you ejaculate immediately.<br>  If you slow down the production of excess hormone - you slow down the ejaculation.<br>  <br>  In fact, there's NO product, exercise, or technique that can stop severe premature ejaculation when used alone. NONE! Severe premature ejaculation is an extremely complex condition the causes of premature ejaculation are both physical and psychological. To cure premature ejaculation requires a combination of products that simultaneously attack and eliminate each cause. Only Last-Longer has a combination of products strong enough to eliminate ALL aspects of both the physical and psychological causes of premature ejaculation.<br>  Quite often, when a man gains good ejaculatory control, he suddenly becomes much more interested in sex. And even if he doesn't, it might be nicer for both of you if he lasted longer.<br>  <br>  Faced with involuntary ejaculation, most men try to distract themselves during intercourse, believing that by thinking about other things, they can trick themselves into lasting longer. Usually, that only makes things worse.<br>  <br>  Don't tune out your body. TUNE INTO IT. You need to become more familiar with your different levels of sexual arousal. You also need to recognize how you feel as you approach your point of ejaculatory inevitability, the "point of no return." Once you recognize how you feel close to your point of no return, it's not difficult to make small sexual adjustments that allow you to remain highly aroused without ejaculating.<br>  <br>  Sexual arousal is a four-phase process. In the Excitement Phase, breathing deepens and erection begins. In the Plateau Stage, erection becomes full and you feel highly aroused. When arousal builds to a certain point, the next phase occurs, Orgasm with Ejaculation. Then during the Resolution Phase, breathing returns to normal and erection subsides. The key to ejaculatory control is to extend the Plateau Phase, to maintain arousal without triggering Orgasm and Ejaculation.<br>  <br>  To learn ejaculatory control:<br>  <br>  * Don't use drugs or alcohol. They're distracting and they interfere with the self-awareness crucial to learning ejaculatory control.<br>  * Appreciate whole-body sensuality. Men often think sex happens only in the penis and only during intercourse. That view is a one-way ticket to uncontrolled ejaculation (not to mention erection problems, and women with those proverbial headaches). The best sex involves head-to-toe arousal. Men learning how to approach -- but not arrive at -- their point of no return, need to appreciate whole-body sensuality, the pleasure potential in every square inch of the body. Whole-body sensuality releases tension. Tense bodies that have no other outlet often find release through involuntary ejaculation. But as you learn to appreciate sensual pleasure from head to toe, whole-body arousal takes the pressure off your penis, and you last longer.<br>  * Whole-body sensuality means relaxation, but the "relaxation" involved in great sex is not the kind that includes an easy chair, a six pack, and Monday Night Football. It's the kind you feel after a hot bath or a good massage. In fact, bathing or showering together before lovemaking can help men relax and appreciate whole-body sensuality -- and last longer.<br>  * Breathe deeply. One very easy way to stay relaxed while making love is to breathe deeply. The body has a natural tendency to breathe deeply during sex. But many men fight it. They think they should stay in control by not breathing deeply and making the little love-moan sounds that go along with it. But when men work to control their breathing, they often sacrifice ejaculatory control. Try breathing deeply. Let your breath go. Many men are amazed how much this one little change improves their ejaculatory control.<br>  * Start with masturbation with a dry hand. By varying how you caress your penis, you can learn to stay highly aroused for quite a while without coming. When you feel yourself approaching your point of no return, simply back off a bit, strokestroke yourself more gently or not at all, and stay aroused without ejaculating. Then as you feel yourself getting a little distance from your point of no return, return to more vigorous self-stimulation. Repeat this several times over several sessions. Approach your point of no return, then back off. For most men, it doesn't take long to develop good ejaculatory control while alone.<br>  Then move on to masturbation with a lubricated hand. Use saliva, vegetable oil, or a commercial sexual lubricant. For most people, lubricants increase the sensual intensity of erotic fondling. Follow the same program: Masturbate until you approach your point of no return, then back off. Repeat this several times over several sessions.<br>  * Once you have good control during masturbation, and appreciate whole-body sensuality, and feel comfortable breathing deeply during lovemaking, then you're ready for the couples program -- if you're in a couple. The couple approach is called the "Stop-Start Technique." First, arrange "stop" and "start" signals with your lover, for example, a light pinch or tap, or a tug on an ear.<br>  Then, your lover strokes your penis by hand as you lie still. When you approach your point of no return, give the "stop" signal. Your lover immediately stops stroking you and simply holds your penis gently, as you continue to breathe deeply and pays close attention to the sensations you're feeling. When you no longer feels close to ejaculation, gives the "start" signal, and your lover begins stroking you again. How many stops and starts should you do? A half-dozen over a 15-minute period works well for most couples. Do what feels comfortable for you.<br>  <br>  Last-Longer is the only male sexual performance formula that, not only stops premature ejaculation, but actually "cures" it. Last-Longer is the only product that allows "YOU" to control when you ejaculate|`|AA10393438	Of course, there are natural creams that U can use to get this fixed.|`|a854fda1c81ef7b9b9ab1b3da4e7d481aa	i very old trick,i have learned as a old salt,is the chinese way<br>  at least,i was told that it is called a chinese number.<br>  when you are busy,pumping ,just stop,well in time before you come,and lay still, until the urge is gone,than start again slowly<br>  and repeat this.<br>  this way you can make love all night,and have the grande finale<br>  in the morning when the birds start singing again.<br>  good luck!|`|ef658699ac0cb6328aa9de70ea00b22caa	Sexology book says to hold the portion or hinge between the penis and testis tightly for a while when u r inside, and pause movement, breath nicely, when u feel like ejaculating. And repeat the steps often by giving breaks on movement.<br>  <br>  But , <br>  masturbation/ oral sex before actual action, (because when u do in vagina after once doing masturbation the time u take to ejaculate is increased),  will resolve this problem. In means of satisfaction it is better to increase the time of fore plays and do sex when u r fresh and relaxed. An urge in sex always results in dissatisfaction by both. <br>  Also always practise inside vagina so that u will get accommodated to it and the urge to ejaculation is comparatively a mental desire, so have talks while sex to deviate yourself from climax.<br>  But the fact is men get the sort of good feeling in sex only during the time of ejaculation where they fly and forget the world they are in. Premature Ejaculation has to be taken care only for the sake of women, becoz men lay down immediately after they complete with and women not yet yet would have started.

b3d1ac41dcc7b614d2a984491065915aaa	I found a great way to lose weight fast and keep it off.  I do body cleansing.  I lost 13 pounds in  9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. Cleansing will help the body get rid of toxins.  Toxins come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives etc.  The toxins get stored in the fat in our body.  To shrink the fat, we have to get rid of the toxins by cleansing.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.

(Guess my doctors don't give a darn.)<br>  I have no adverse side effects that I am aware of, (besides the whole osteoperosis thing)  and am currently 30years old. <br>  I cannot speak of the effectiveness of the drug though, as far as its birth control effectiveness, because I am completely abstinent. (I am not joking about REALLY liking not having a rag!!! its the only reason i take it!!!)|`|79b925086d95f7b70d82315a1020d91aaa	I know a couple of girls who took it for at least 10 years. They have both stopped because of the side effects - bone loss and cancer. They have both switched to bioidentical progesterone.<br>  <br>  One girl is using progesterone to tame her fibroids. She tells me that it works better than Depo for the pain.

P544Sbmqaa	There are PLENTY of high calories things she can eat that dont violate the neutropenic diet. First and foremost, try shakes or drinks like pediasure, ensure, boost, slim fast shakes, or any other kind of meal replacement shake or bar.  They are high in calories and proteins.  Milk shakes are massively high in calories and fine for her to eat.  Breads, and potatoes are good to eat and will be easy on her stomach.  To help her eat cooked foods, cool them down before serving.  Like, from the stove to the freezer.  It sucks to eat it cold, but eating it cold will remove the smell of the foods, and the smell is often what makes people sick while eating.    More than likely they will end up doing some sort of feeding tube, but she needs to try to continue eating even with the tube as much a she can.    Also, there should be a dietitian either available to her (parents) or actually on her team of docs.  That is the best place to go for ideas.|`|WdW1ga14aa	Sorry to hear about your bf niece, I would try having her drink Ensures, or eat potatoe's, maybe some rice or pasta.

We were told to add fatty foods to meals like cheese or butter on her vegetables.  It is pretty much a case of whatever they want to eat then let them eat it.  We also gave our daughter Sustagen milk drinks, (which is what they were putting through her nasogastric tube when she had one) but she had to just sip on them otherwise if she drank them too quick she would vomit.  And she loved toasted cheese sandwiches. I had to tell her if she didn't eat she would have the tube put back in, and that helped.  Although the procedure of having a nasogastric tube put in is not very nice, it may be the best thing for her.  Most patients have them.  Thinking of her and hope she makes a full recovery.

5b839eb5427f8e6a60f88cee9d2dc2ecaa	The secrets I share you with young one must never be revealed....<br>  <br>  Bruce Lee's "Lethal Physique" Bodybuilding Program<br>  (performed on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays)<br>  <br>  Exercise Sets Repetitions<br>  Clean & Press 2 8<br>  Squats 2 12<br>  Pullovers 2 8<br>  Bench Presses 2 6<br>  Good Mornings 2 8<br>  Barbell Curls 2 8<br>  <br>  The Breakdown of the Routine:<br>  <br>  1.) Clean & Press: Lee would begin this movement by taking a shoulder-width grip on an Olympic barbell. Bending his knees, he would squat down in front of the resistance and, with a quick snap of his arms and a thrust from his legs, clean the barbell to his chest and stand up. After a brief pause, Lee would then thrust the barbell to arms length overhead, pause briefly, and then lower the barbell back to the top of his chest. After another brief pause, he would lower the barbell back to the floor (the starting position). With absolutely no rest, Lee would then initiate his second repetition of the movement and continue to do so until he had completed eight repetitions. After a very brief rest, so as to take full advantage of the cardio-respiratory benefits as well as the strength-building benefits, Lee would perform a second -- and final -- set.<br>  <br>  2.) Squats: This staple of bodybuilding movements was the cornerstone of Bruce Lee's barbell training. He had dozens of articles that he'd clipped out on the mechanics and benefits of squats and he practiced many variations of this exercise. In his routine, however, he performed the exercise in the standard fashion. Resting a barbell across his shoulders, Lee would place his feet approximately shoulder-width apart. Making sure that he was properly balanced, Lee would slowly ascend to a full squat position. With absolutely zero pause in the bottom position, Lee would then immediately return -- using the strength of his hips, glutes, hamstrings, calves and quadriceps -- to the starting position, whereupon he would commence rep number two. Lee would perform 12 repetitions in this movement and, after a short breather, return and re-shoulder the barbell for one more set of 12 reps.<br>  <br>  3.) Pullovers: Although there exists no physical evidence that Bruce Lee supersetted barbell pullovers with squats, there is reason to believe that this was case -- if only for the fact that such was the method advocated in the articles he read. Squats were considered a great "overall" muscle builder, whereas pullovers were simply considered a "rib box expander" or "breathing exercise." Consequently, the fashion of incorporating pullovers in the late 1960s and early 1970s was as a "finishing" movement for squats. This being the case, Lee would perform the movement in the standard fashion; i.e., by lying down on his back upon a flat bench and taking a shoulder-width grip on a barbell that he would then proceed to press out to full extension above his chest. From this position, Lee would lower the barbell -- making sure to keep a slight bend in his elbows so as not to strain the elbow joint -- behind his head until it touched the floor ever so slightly and provided a comfortable stretch to his lats. From this fully-extended position, Lee would then slowly reverse the motion through the contraction of his lats, pecs and long-head of the triceps. He would repeat this movement for two sets of eight repetitions.<br>  <br>  4.) Bench Presses: Bruce Lee was able to develop an incredible chest musculature. His upper pecs were particularly impressive, bunching and splitting into thousands of fibrous bands. And, as far as his personal training records indicate, the only direct barbell movement he performed to develop his chest was the good old fashioned bench press. Lying down upon a flat bench, and again taking a shoulder-width grip on an Olympic barbell, Lee would press the weight off the support pins to arms length above his chest. From this locked-out position, Lee would then lower the barbell to his chest and, exhaling, press it back up to the fully-locked out (or starting) position. He would repeat this movement for six repetitions and then, after a brief respite, return to the bench for one more set of six reps.<br>  <br>  5.) Good Mornings: A word of caution about this exercise. Lee performed this movement to strengthen his lower back. However, one day in early 1970 he loaded up the bar with 135 pounds (his bodyweight at the time) and -- without a warm up -- proceeded to knock off eight repetitions. On his last rep he felt a "pop" and found out later that he had damaged the fourth sacral nerve of his lower back. The result was the Lee had to endure incredible back pain for the remainder of his life. This is not to say that the movement is without merit, just make sure that you perform an adequate warm-up prior to employing, it. Placing a barbell across his shoulders, Lee would place his feet three inches apart "You really don't need any weight but the empty bar on your shoulders - it's more of a limbering movement") and bend over from the waist keeping his hands on the barbell at all times. Lee would bend over until his back was at a 90 degree angle to his hips and then return to the upright position. Lee performed two sets of eight repetitions of this movement.<br>  <br>  6.) Barbell Curls: Bruce Lee performed barbell curls not only in his garage gym on Roscomare Avenue in Bel Air, but also in his studio office in Hong Kong. They were a staple or "core" movement in his weight training routine and were also responsible for building a very impressive pair of biceps on Lee -- not to mention incredible pulling power, which he used to such good effect in all of his sparring sessions! To perform this movement properly, Lee would take a comfortable shoulder-width grip on the barbell with his palms facing forwards. Keeping a slight bend in his knees for stabilization purposes, Lee would then contract his biceps and curl the barbell up to a point level with his upper pecs. Pausing briefly in this fully-contracted position, Lee would then slowly lower the barbell back to the starting position. Two sets of eight repetitions of this movement would typically wrap up Lee's bodybuilding routine.<br>  <br>  Going Beyond "Routine"<br>  <br>  Lee didn't just train with the above listed exercises. He would also incorporate weight training into his martial art workouts. "Bruce would always shadow box with small weights in his hands and he'd do a drill in which he'd punch for 12 series in a row, 100 punches per series, using a pyramid system of 1,2,3,5,7 and 10-pound weights -- and then he'd reverse the pyramid and go 10, 7, 5, 3, 2, 1 and finally "zero" weight.<br>  <br>  It didn't stop there however. When Lee wasn't training with weights in his martial art workouts or during one of his three designated whole-body training sessions, he could be found curling a dumbbell in the office in his house. "He was always using that dumbbell," Linda his wife says, looking back on her husband's training habits. "Bruce had the unique ability to be able to several things at once. It wasn't all unusual for me to find him watching a boxing match on TV, simultaneously performing a full side splits, while reading a book in one hand and pumping a dumbbell in the other."<br>  <br>  Enjoy mightyrew lee.|`|67cc44681bbfee659ebe22ece6908961aa	You would need to look into Enduranced based exercises.|`|5c07eea93e2b7eb3dfa4e16ee3a3c43eaa	The problem with the Bruce Lee physique is that it is pretty much impossible to reproduce legally.

G0ljmbAvaa	The reason they are telling you to seperate the days is because of two reasons.  First...intensity.  If you really want results then you have to work very very hard.  If you are working very hard lifting weights then it is assumed you will be too tired to really do a very intense cardio workout.  Second...is the interest of time.  If you only have say one hour to work out then it's going to be hard to do both cardio and weights because to really get great results you would want longer workout sessions and most people don't have the time to do both.  There is no other reason why you have to do them on seperate days.      You can do both cardio and weights on the same days but remember to make sure you have enough time and really put a lot of effort into both workouts.    What you don't want to do is weight training on the same body parts two days in a row...don't do bicep curls two days in a row using weights etc.  The reason is because when you do weight lifting your body needs to rest and heal up which usually takes a day.  During that rest day of not lifting weights on that body part...is when your body actually repairs itself and that is how you get stronger...from the repaired muscle...so you have to let your muscles rest at least one day.  That is not the case for cardio.  You could do cardio every day if you want to and still be okay.  But you don't have to do it every day, I'm just saying that you could.|`|fL8CIA2Xaa	Don't do weight training if your trying to lose weight, cardio, low carb|`|vzuQqsR1aa	Exercise, low carb, low sugar intake.

8OqdoIHtaa	I couldn't take the oral meds and was put on insulin very soon after diagnosis and have been doing well on it.     As soon as I started getting my blood sugar down within target ranges using insulin, my energy went up and the fatigue was greatly reduced.     I still get sleepy if my blood sugar goes over the recommended range, so I'm careful to count my carbs accurately, so I know exactly how much rapid insulin to take. Sleepiness and fatigue are symptoms of high blood sugar,  and it IS known to cause mental confusion. So is really low blood sugar.     There are so many complications and contraintications with the oral meds, and now its coming out that many of them are not as safe as once thought. I think more people will be switching to insulin because of this.     Out of all the oral meds, the safest one is metformin, and its IS the gold standard of oral meds.     If you are going on insulin, look at Lantus or Levemir. They are both long acting basal insulins, with less of a peak, so they don't cause so many lows. Mixed insulins can cause low blood sugar.     For meal times, ask your doctor to put you on or keep you on Metformin. If you can't take Metformin, ask for a rapid insulin for meals, after you get the long acting insulin figured out.     They'll start you on a very low dose and you increase it every 3 to 4 days until you get a consistently good fasting number.     Metformin and a long acting basal insulin is a very good combination for most type 2s.     If you can count carbs, then you can deal with the fast acting insulin, but metformin can help you lose weight, so its great if you can take it instead.     If metformin causes digestive problems, take it with yogurt and a glass of water, before your meals. This usually cancels out the stomach problems for most people. Use a yogurt with no sugar added, so its low carb.    Hope this helps  Good luck!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	Insulin works much faster and is definitely better.|`|MQ973M96aa	Work harder and exercise a lot, trial and error my friend.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	My husband is 55 and was diagnosed a few years ago for Type 2.  He was on several oral meds for the first year, and was in the hospital for something totally unrelated and when he was there they gave him insulin instead of his oral meds and his blood sugar was much better. Since then his endocrinologist put him on insulin, and it works faster and for the most part better.
AaoLwJJWaa	the best thing to do would be to hire a personal trainer, just for two or three sessions, they'll take you through all the equipment depending on ur goals, and if you write down each workout you can start from there, after some weeks just doing those workouts, (after ur first real workout ur gonna be sore for about a week, just warning u ahead of time lol) but then go to sites like bodybuilding.com and shapefit.com for plenty of useful info

WCrCEN8gaa	For me, its always harder to function in the afternoon. The day is half over and I want it to be completely over. I always feel crappy in the second half of the day. I find that in the mourning I am more optimistic and open to new things whereas in the afternoon I am fed up and annoyed.   Try to relax a little bit in the afternoon or have something that will carry you through the rest of the day. Promise yourself a chocolate bar or watch a movie that you love. Listen to calming music for ten minutes. Try a relaxation exercise. It's stress that is getting to you.   Don't think about all the things that you need to do or all the people you have to please.

VA1epT8waa	No don't worry about going to the doctor unless you get any sort of numbness in your arm, ice it for 20 min on and 20 min off.

If your arm does get worse thats when you should go see someone.     Good luck|`|x5kHByz3aa	I would give it two or three days to see if the pain lessens some more before worrying too much.

jBvKBrMEaa	I was also younger than 13 the first time I had oral sex. To be honest, I think at that age you are stable enough emotionally: but you do have to watch out for three things:    * disease, oral sex is no safer than vaginal when it comes to disease  * Overbearing partners: do not get this intimate with a partner unless you trust him and yourself to not progress to unprotected intercourse, or you will run slightly greater risk of disease and very real risk of pregnancy!  * Public opinion: depending on the attitudes of your classmates, there might be some strong social stigmas if someone found out about your intimate relationship.|`|rGnlUEpyaa	idk...my bf said he wants to go to the next step and i think he meant oral...we are 13. (idk if we r going to)    Id say it should be fine if your relationship is good and you two are really close.|`|zNElbS50aa	I would say yes, that is an early age. Although, I can't say much, due to the fact that I was 7 years old when I started oral. Not proud of that at all. At 13 years old, teens don't know what is considered boundaries for oral...Some may go further into oral and one partner may not want to go and do that. I would say, it's not wise to do things of the sort, until your much older and wiser. Wait till your 15 and have gone through your health class. The health class I'm sure will change your mind do to the facts on STDS.
VitK0Wenaa	Well not all acne is created equal. So you need to start out by finding out exactly what you have.    Unless you have been diagnosed as having an allergy, don't assume that you do. It sounds to me like these products are just way too harsh. Typical "acne" washes are aimed at adolescent skin that is producing too much oil. That may not be your problem at all.    It's impossible to say what your situation is, but hormones, stress and nutrition all play a role. Yeah hormones, we all go through it.    So, skin produces oil and sometimes it just sits in the pore. Then it oxidizes (becomes a blackhead) Add a little bacteria and you have a pimple.  The harshness of the products you describe  is causing your skin to react by putting out more oil so it is getting worse. I suspect that is what the toner did too. Not all people need toners. Skin tries to protect you, so if you dry it out, your body just makes more oil to try to fix it.      So, not much you can do about hormones. But you can be kind to your skin. Use a very mild cleanser, stay away from acne systems or anything aimed at oily skin. You can make yourself an oatmeal face bag. Just grind some oatmeal and put it in a cloth bag. Use this to wash your face with just a tiny bit of soap. You can also make cleansing grains by grating some mild soap (like dove) in a jar with some ground oatmeal. Use it to wash your face, massaging it in. The soap will clean and disinfect and the oatmeal exfoliates the dead skin cells, opens the pores and soothes the irritation.    Remember that bacteria is what makes pimples. So be careful with what you let come in contact with your face. Change your pillow case daily, if you have long hair, pull it back and away from your face.     Even though you think oil is the problem, you still need to moisturize. Choose a light moisturizer, preferably something with jojoba oil. If possible, don't use liquid makeup or foundations. Instead use a mineral foundation that is brushed on.    If you are still having acne, check with a doctor. There are many skin problems that look like acne, but they have different causes.|`|zTK9VVkpaa	I use Clean and Clear. and i fine it works wonders it is 40$ for the kit.. but its AMAZING. better then Vichy, Clinique and this stuff reccomended by the dematoglgist.  I really like it!|`|nJS9xXtSaa	You might want to go to get a recommendation from your doctor, but i use clean and clear and instead of benzol peroxide it contains salicylic acid. There are tons of products other then clean and clear though just try a bunch other brands and you'll eventually find the perfect one.

1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	Your friend is going to be just fine.  Genital Herpes is an extremely common virus, one that OB's are consistently aware of.  If she has an active outbreak, her child can be taken via C-section.  She just needs to be fully aware of her outbreaks, and make sure not to deliver if she is having an outbreak.  Her OB will help prevent this.  My guess is she is fully aware of the complications of delivering with an outbreak - blindness for her newborn, breathing complications, infections, and death.  But, as long as she delivers C-section, both mom and sweet baby will be just fine!  Let her know this.  It's hard enough to prepare for birth.  Herpes just makes it more complicated, but certainly not unachievable.|`|fk9AvB25aa	Your friend will be find and she is not likely to pass herpes to the child while it's in the womb. There is more danger of passing herpes to a baby when it comes through the birth canal.    Also if she is using some kind of suppressive therapy she will even further reduce her risk of passing herpes to her baby and to her partner (if they don't have herpes).   If she does get out breaks she should let her doctor know about them when she goes into visit they should check her and her baby out to be on the safe side.|`|WCrCEN8gaa	My sister has herpes and her doctor said that she could give herpes to her kid if she had an outbreak and delivered vaginally.

zuZntfiwaa	[In no way should you construe the following as professional advice, either from a mental health or "strictly" medical standpoint. Still, I'll try to help from some of my own experience and knowledge I've gleaned over the years from various sources.]    Your behaviors are not healthy. Try to separate your behavior from words like "bad" or "wrong," which carry too much moral weight. Just realize what you're doing is going to make you sicker than you ever imagined.    First, not only is aspirin dangerous because of its anti-coagulant properties. It can also eat away at your stomach lining. This is why doctors monitor their patients who take aspirin regularly so carefully and prescribe the lowest effective dose possible.    Advil is also dangerous for the same reason. In fact, it's even worse than aspirin in this respect. People who take too much Advil (or any other kind of ibuprofen) can not only have their stomach lining eaten away but also get GERD, which can then lead to higher risk of esophageal cancer and necessitate a medication like Prilosec.    Tylenol (acetaminophen) is also not as safe as it seems. It's liver-toxic, and taking 5 extra-strength pills instead of 2 each time you take them could actually send you to the hospital or kill you. (So said my doctor's nurse when I very ignorantly almost did that to myself. I'd been given a prescription with dosages much higher than the usual because I'd been in a lot of pain but didn't want to take narcotics, which had already screwed up my guts so much that my illness was made much worse. I misunderstood my doctor's statement about how much leeway I had to take another couple of pills in a 24-hour period "if need be." As a result, if I hadn't had a nice big meal with a lot of dairy in it just before I popped the extras I thought I was allowed, I would have been dead!)    Virtually every medication is either liver-toxic or kidney-toxic, even if you take it as directed. That's one reason why it's so important to take meds only as directed. You don't want to screw up your liver or kidneys so much that it will be difficult for you to take a medication you really need somewhere down the line. If you listen closely to all the drug ads on TV, you'll notice that every single one of them says something like "X is not for people with liver problems" or "If you have kidney problems, you should not take Y." That's why you want to keep your kidneys and liver as healthy as possible.    You've had a very hard life, and it won't be easy to resolve what you've been dealing with anytime soon. It's an ongoing process. You'll first need to replace very self-destructive behaviors with ones less so. So for starters, take meds only as directed until you can get better control over the situation and talk with your counselor. And yes, talking with your aunt and asking her to put the meds under lock and key would probably be a big help.    If you can, instead of taking the pills, go for emotional eating. Get a food you're forbidden from eating (either by others or yourself) and binge on it some, in private if need be---unless you're diabetic, of course. (And watch out if diabetes runs in the family, although if you go to your doctor you could ask her to do a few blood tests to see if you're pre-diabetic. You don't want to eat so much sugar at one sitting that it trips a trigger....)    Or you could try something like fooling yourself into thinking you're taking forbidden/painkilling pills by taking harmless ones. For instance, you could buy a lot of vitamin B and C tablets and swallow them whenever you get the urge to pop pills. (Vitamin B can also elevate your energy. Vitamin C is a good anti-oxidant.) You could even take vitamin D, which will also improve mood and energy, although that's a little bit more complicated. Or try something like melatonin, which helps put you to sleep in a non-addictive way. (Sleeping more will probably help your mind and body anyway in getting through all you're trying to.)    It seems pretty obvious that you have an addictive personality, at least for now. No matter what, avoid all narcotics. It's better to take 3-5 aspirin when you're supposed to take 2 than to take any narcotic.    Of course, talk to your counselor about all this. Talk to your aunt if you feel comfortable doing so. But at least ask yourself in any situation "How can I choose a less self-destructive option?" So take the 2 aspirin (preferable enteric) instead of the 3-5, or gobble up comfort foods and forbidden foods. Hopefully you'll move completely to emotional eating for a while, since that's far healthier than cutting yourself or emotional pill-popping.    Take good care.... We're all thinking about you....|`|kkFK74n4aa	As you know I've been following your questions, so I know where this desire to take pills is coming from and I totally have compassion for you.    That said, while an extra 1 or 2 aspirin won't really do you any harm now, it's just the first step on a tragically slippery slope. Yeah, your life has been pretty messed up so far, but you're also a good person so far as I've been able to tell. It would be a loss to the world if you sunk into the downward spiral of pill-popping.    I know it's insanely hard right now, but things will get better. They always do. Hell, I'm living proof! :P    Short answer: Yes, it's wrong, but not because society says so; only because you deserve better for yourself.|`|f2siAy0raa	yes. in a while the pills won't help anymore b/c your body will be used to them, and they'll you could overdose and die. tell your aunt what you've been doing so she can hold you accountable; don't let her give you anymore|`|H1T2sBF6aa	Yes it is bad. There is no reason for you to take over the directed amount or to take it for no reason. The more you take these medications the less likely they are to work for you when you really need them. I would advise you to tell your counselor about this. And it is a good idea to see them more frequently.|`|f35e4adb621395ef94ce87b7a970392baa	Tell your aunt that, because of the bad headaches, etc., that you want to see a medical doctor.  Go in alone, and talk to your doctor.  The doctor can help you figure out if that many pills are bad for you, what else you can do, maybe a different councilor to see (as this one doesn't seem to be helping), and perhaps even medication for your depression, or other possible treatments.        And as for the answer for your question, I don't think this your current behavior and situation are positive for you.    Edited to add:  If you want to pop pills, take 3-4 Advil.  Do NOT take large amounts of Aspirin.  Aspirin is an anticoagulant (blood-thinner).  You could possibly bleed to death if you get cut or bruised.  If you notice one on you, apply firm, direct pressure, and if it doesn't stop bleeding in a couple minutes, go to the emergency room and tell them how many you took in the past day and week (what causes the bleeding affects how they would treat you, so you should tell them immediately.  Blame it on an ache if you need to.)  And this will last several days after you stop taking the aspirin (you need to make new platelets).      Good luck with getting better!|`|2XQstX3xaa	Honey, I understand the feeling of needing to self medicate but that's how my sisters addiction to pain killers started and now she's in rehab and facing a few years in prison. I not only have to worry about her safety while driving but now I have to worry about her going to prison. She's no longer herself now that the pills have taken over so in a sense I've lost my sister whom I love dearly. And it all started with her trying to self medicate for her depression. I don't blame her for it because she didn't know what she was getting herself into and everyone always says "it won't happen to me" but it always does. So please get the proper help for your depression, it's not shameful and it doesn't make you weak to admit you need help so the doctor can properly medicate you. I don't even know you as a person but I don't want you to go through what my sister has, it's ruined her life and broken my heart to see her slowly fall to rock bottom, Thank God after she almost killed herself and someone else in a terrible car wreck she's getting help.
AA10246871	I don't remember my exact age--it was some time in the fifth grade, so around the age of 10, give or take a bit.    I also don't remember when I started shaving. What I do remember is that we girls had a big discussion about shaving, and I got some oohs and aaahs because I got to use shave cream. That discussion was in the spring of fifth grade.    It's odd that you ask about it, as I was just discussing this with a friend. Her husband asked her when they were dating to please not shave. He prefers women who don't. She's okay with not shaving her legs, but she'd really like to shave her underarms from time to time. She was asking me about what kind of razor I use, and whether or not I use shave gel or cream, etc. She's planning on shaving her underarms, and she's kind of stressed about it, because she knows he's going to at least mention it, if not give her some grief. Not for the first time, I made the comment that it's her body, and she can do as she pleases. But the whole discussion made me wonder if it IS her body. How much ownership does she have when she cannot do certain things because of what her husband does or does not like?|`|ma3dPHZTaa	Got it around nine and a half started shaving around the same time.|`|jrVExVQcaa	why do you relle care bout when we started shaving??? yeah we shave so what.|`|QsD9VOMYaa	Got it at 9, and started waxing it straight away!! lol   (mum told me waxing is better than shaving, so Ive always been waxing)

ICLekd2Vaa	always with the weightlifting Q's? lol    u gotta get out more!! ;)|`|6MwIvHlNaa	No easy answer, everybody is different.    I try not to attempt any weight that I cannot do 3 reps unaided with.  I may break this rule if I get stuck at a certain weight for more than a couple of months.  I often go down to 1 rep at 1RM on bench press because it is relatively safe with being stable on bench and having a spotter.  I wouldn't go this low on squats because it would be too dangerous.    I make the best gains doing, 3 short, heavy sessions per week.    I personally prefer lifting the heaviest weight first (after warm up sets) then reducing the weight.  This means i'm not tired from lifting lower weight.    eg Bench Press    bar only x 20 (warm up)  50 kg x 12 (warm up)  120kg x 4  100kg x 6  80kg x 8  50kg (warm down)

A balanced diet is the best key to lose weight.  With the exercise you described a long side good nutrition, and determination, you will achieve your health goals in no time.|`|1jkQ8fZCaa	This is a wonderful idea...i had the same problem even.. Yes invest in a good pair of shock abosorbing running shoes. They are meant to make sure that your knees and back dont get injured.    Running is an excellent way to lose weight. It is pritty much nessecary!  For maixume fat burn look up for suggested heart rate. You can find it anywhere and stay within your limits. I know sometimes it my seem like you arent doing anything or you dont feel anything, but trust me in 3-6 weeks you will see a difference.  You need to run at least every other night....to show improvement. Running once a week wont work at all. It is pointless.   DONT GET DISCOURAGED! You arent running marathons....just yet at least.  Make sure after or before you work out, even if you are sore, DONTTTTTTTTTTT TAKE ANY RELEIFT PILLS!!!!!! Ex. Tylonal, Advil, Aleve. You have a gland under your thoart that releases a protein to help repair you muscles after work out. If you take these it stops the glad from releasing its jucie! and your whole work out was pointless.!! Seriously!  If you are into the whole protein shake thing. Take it 2-3 hours before you work out. NEVER TAKE IT AFTER!!!    Make sure you eat right. and remember, you dont need a gym or fancy equipment to stay in shape. Join a school sport if you have too and good luck!|`|8xeGoCNGaa	Running burns roughly 250-300 calories per 40 minutes.  Here's a basic recipe that will help ANYONE loose weight:    - Eat healthy: This means complex carbohydrates like brown rice, potatoes, whole wheat cereals, etc...  Cut out the sweets at all costs.  Stay away from butter, margarine, salt and sugar.   Drink lots of water...2 liters per day)    Eat smaller portions, frequently.  Try to squeeze in 6 meals a day.  Do not skip meals.  This puts your body into starvation mode which leads to your body holding onto your fat.      - Exercise 4 - 5 times per week.  Do a Google search for synergistic  and core workouts.  Get into a routine and stick to it!  Get skipping rope...      Good luck!!|`|T9io7k8aaa	Running is a great way to start but as a teen who always needed to lose a few running is the most tiring way to go about it     Try looking at workouts online like ones you can do in your bedroom and just be consistent with it.  You also gotta watch what you eat though.. I worked out a LOT but still ate fast food daily so I kept gaining..    Best way to do this is before you eat always ask if you're actually hungry. and when you actually ARE hungry..go ahead and eat what you actually crave (with discretion)|`|oKyxOeqOaa	No! Most people who start by trying to run get very uncomfortable and the pain of it is such a negetive experience that they give it up. That is only natural as pain is part of our bodies survival warning system. The walk-jog system is a good idea,but you may want to look for another reason to stick to it. A paper or flyer route would mean you would be paid to get in shape. A buddy is also a good way to keep it up on the days you don't feel up to it. A good way to start a program is to take the stairs when possible or walk the neibors dogs. It doesn't take much action to make the difference at the start.Be sure to stretch a little in the mornings so you don't hurt yourself when everything starts to tighten up.I'm 41 and I do 4miles before breakfast, can touch my wrists to the floor and do a backflip. I couldn' do any of that when I was 14. Go slow and steady, stick to it and you can Get to whatever level of fit you want.(p.s.No pop) Good Luck!!!|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Took me about six months with a moderate diet and weekly running to lose that much weight.  Thirty to forty minutes is not enough. Do not simply run for an hour, and then walk whenever you feel tired, you won't have the discipline to push yourself hard enough.  Instead pick a route which you feel capable of running, then do the old run for two telephone poles and walk for one.  As you get in better shape you can run for more and more telephone poles.|`|KvyB0E77aa	If you can exercise about twenty minutes 4-5 days a week that is plenty. If you don't want to run then fast walking is excellent way to burn calories. Also do at least 20 sit ups three times a day.  The most important thing to do with your exercise is to change what you're eating.  The number one reason people get overweight is not that they eat to much, it's because they eat the wrong foods.  The worst food is anything containing white starch. Such foods as white bread, white pasta,white rice,white potatoes, and cereals are as bad as eating sugar.  Start by avoiding all starches for two weeks. Eat only meats,cheeses,and green vegetables. If you exercise you will lose 10 Lbs. in 10 days.  Then resume eating starches in small portions. Only eat complex starches such as rye/wheat bread, brown rice, sweet potatoes,and bran cereal without sugar.   You'll easily lose 40 lbs in six months and you'll feel great!|`|gjAZeRyfaa	Yes, thats what I did.  I was 100+lbs overweight.  I could  barely make it 3 houses down the street, but each time  I would jog farther, then walk then jog.  I lost all the weight  in 7mos. but was eating less than 500 calories.  I don't  recommend that though, vary your calorie intake up and  down to keep you metabolism off balance    Any aerobic exercise that gets your heart rate up,  biking, jumping rope etc.|`|IhZSaDXDaa	Yes but I suggest going easy the first few days and then doing harder running the next couple of days.|`|6n527pAYaa	OK - here's the real story:  In order to lose weight, you have to expend more calories than you consume.  Each 3500 calories is worth one pound.  So eat less, exercise moderately, and in 6 month, you can lose 30 pounds. There is no easy way to do this.|`|1gWQh9tWaa	Running  is  always good  for your body  Especially since  its  cardio and that  works  out  your  whole  body   but  its good  to alternate  so your  bdy doesnt  get to accustomed to doing the  same routines over an over.|`|4tWbC3GPaa	Running or Brisk Walking is better.  Make sure that you eat right.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	you probably arent that overweight. everyone thinks anyone bigger then a size 2 is fat. dont worry about it. but if it bothers you that much maybe run a little. swimmings really good exercise too. just go to the school pool on the weekend and swim a few laps. eat more filling foods. stuff like that. good luck. :)|`|SYpVGGJTaa	If you want to lose weight try drinking lots of water, eat healthy, and exercise. I would not recommend running, it is hard on your joints. Low impact exercise is best, anything to get your heartbeat up and make you sweat. Good Luck!|`|dTdLrjFNaa	Running is a great form of exercise. As long as you have comfortable sneakers that don't hurt your feet when you run, you should be good.    Sit-ups are good to tone your abs. And your plan is great, but keep in mind that you might not lose all that, and you'll gain some muscle. So the scale is not as accurate as what you see in the mirror. As long as you feel confident about who you are, you should be happy. :)|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Start your fitness program by walking the first few weeks, not jogging. By walking, you'll get a sense of your body, your rhythm, and your ability.You'll also start to build core body strength to sustain you when you go faster. If you start too fast, you risk injuring yourself and will give up.     Walk regularly and briskly (you should breathe harder, but not so fast that you can't talk) until you can do 1 or 2 miles. As your stamina increases, then you can combine short jogs with your walking (walk/jog), and when able step up to a slow jog and increase your jogging over walking. (You can break it up too by swimming, bike-riding, taking stairs instead of elevators, and even just doing vigorous housework.)    Walk at least 4-5 times a week. And yes, do get good shoes.  Also, start on a healthy diet and drink water.    Don't worry how long it will take to lose weight. If you do your plan regularly, your weight will come off at just the right and healthy rate for your body.    Good luck.|`|wW4Xao04aa	Yeah running is a great way to loose weight.  I've been runnig all my life and and now a top competior in several events... But reall to loose weight healthy and fast you want to run about 5 times a week for over 30 to 40 minutes.  Once you do start loosing weight you might want to bumb it up to 6 times a week.  But do not run over 6 times a week beaucse you need to let your body recover...  I would also suggest running at the night because it burns all the calories you consumed during the day and you feel more "pumped up" while running.  Don't kill yourself the first couple weeks but try to keep your heart rate above 140.      About the diet stick to natural foods... don't eat any fried foods or salted snacks and try to lay off the sugars...  Also when buying simple things like milk, get the fat free version... Saves a lot of fat    Good luck|`|KKh8rikGaa	Seems to me you know what to do so just DO IT, Stay away from pills or drugs, that maybe worse than being over weight in the first place|`|VvMquavyaa	You need to start slow! Chances are if you havent been active in a long time, you will tire easily and way too fast. Start walking first, move up to walking a few minutes then jogging a few, etc. If you just jump right in without building up, you risk injury and even heart issues.    A healthy rate of weight loss is about 1-3lbs a week, but if you modify your diet as well as exercise you may lose more. Just cutting out something like sodas from your diet can make you loose more than 5 lbs the first week!    when you use the Bowflex, dont forget to stretch beforehand! For most exercises you probably want to start with a low weight and a moderate number of reps... like 5 lbs with 15 reps on arm exercises, if that doesnt burn (it should!) then replace it with something higher.|`|RpcyfAjLaa	yes and sit ups, unless your happy|`|sIdoUK2Laa	that sounds like an excellent idea.  you are on the right track.  great job and stick to it!    please don't ever take any pills|`|WxNlQMibaa	1 hour run and walk or jog back run with dog if you have|`|a5UoMPOhaa	i SHOULD FOLLOW THIS SAME PLAN!|`|yNgACBJvaa	do not ever take pills or any crap like that, they do not work and they are bad for your body    go to this website, you can find worksout that you can do at home. it is 100% free, no need to sign up or pay or any dodgy crap like that    http://www.iwantsixpackabs.com/abs.html    if the guy does 20reps, you can try and do 10reps instead because ur 14 and a girl    check it out and i hope it helps ya|`|0ct8uPw3aa	definitellyyyyy.  teenage obesity is a serious problem.  work out every day.  and lay off the fast food. :)|`|7jcHFmF8aa	iF YOU HAVE A POOL  swim often, or join a pool/health club. Swim there and if you have excersize machines use them. Jog on the tread mill until you need to stop and swim for fun and relaxing. Always keep moving. No elavators, when you are bored, o maybe shopping around the mall just to look|`|aeXmMKRfaa	Best thing to do first is talk to your doctor and make sure you heart and everything else is A-OK. Then i would not run but jog, make sure to pace yourself. Remember you have to burn off more calories then you intake. Remember to do some weight lifting. At 14 you def dont want sagging skin. Good luck!      Oh yeah NO PILLS... bad for the heart and the NEVER work and never will|`|YhxNa5ndaa	well, i know you're gonna hear this from everyone else, but eat healthy. Don't eat as much. Eat larger meals during the day and smaller during the evening. Drink lots of water.    And yes, start running! Maybe join a sport, or maybe just get in shape and then join a sport first. Ideally, you are supposed to have at least forty five minutes of physical activity everyday. Maybe start small and go for walks, up hills to. Don't go into this too quickly|`|2lMP6ow1aa	Google couch potato to 5k. It tells you how you should build up to running.

Don't run like lightning though at first.  at first jog without walking.  then jog a little faster etc.  daily exersizes help too. ( situps pushups trunklifts etc.)  It doesn't happen overnight so don't give up.  don't spend too much money on those shoes though. anyone can lose weight ( in their own time)  good luck!  hope this helps!|`|pLqGakDVaa	You should- as long as you see it as lifestyle change and not a quick fix. If you stop thinking about weight loss and start thinking about being healthy then the weight will come off.  Good running shoes will help as they will take strain out of your feet and calf muscles.  I would start with walking and light jogging to get you going then progress to running when your fitness improves (don't over-do yourself as it will put you off).  Walking and running burns a considerable amount of calories (depending on how far you go- 1hr is about 500 cal walking) but try alternating it with swimming etc. so you don't get bored.   Make sure you have healthy meals (about one clenched fist of protein- chicken, fish etc, one of carbs- potato, pasta etc, and two of fresh fruit or veg). I'm glad you have a healthy attitude to weight-loss/healthy living and wish you luck.  Hope I helped :)|`|H1eshhEIaa	you must understand that you abused your body to be the way you are.   Now you must abuse it again to get back to where you were before.  Not saying that you need to hurt yourself or anything like that, just miss a meal now and then  .   eat smaller portions, and avoid junk food.   Never eat after 5.   Juice instead of Cola.  Fruit instead of Chocolate   Along with all that, be active, get into sports like Basket Ball where you burn lots of calories.  And for the times when you just have to munch on something, try some dried fruit , you find it in most grocery stores.         Good luck!          Yes I do those things,,,,and yes I am slim.    5'10    156 lbs
cgXX13YVaa	It really doesn't matter what you use.    Ellipticals, treadmills, bike's ect.     You have to be dedicated to lose weight by eating healthy meals and constantly being on your exercise routine!! That is the key!!|`|24a78cc0007d10093367ee4cc375a0f6aa	You can lose weight using an elliptical but generally you can get a better workout using a treadmill.  An elliptical is "easier" and you don't work out as hard on it and as you would on a treadmill.    How much you should workout depends on your goals and your current fitness level.  Generally a good workout to lose some weight would be about 45 mins to an hour of high intensity cardio about 3-4 days a week and weights/strength training 3 days a week.|`|KONMkA6faa	yes, but no better than other forms of cardio exercise.|`|9805b39acc1bc1f3a7a13d095f0e0422aa	Both machines will give you a good workout.  If you drop your calorie intake and do 30 minutes of exercise 4 times a week you'll notice a difference within two weeks. But you have to cut the amount you eat and drink as well.|`|2d3a946a6165d3b924d84fcb6bf4aca7aa	Ellipticals are great since they work your whole body.  However, any form or cardio excercise will do the trick.  It's best to stick to something you enjoy so that you will keep doing it.  Also very important to eat a healthy well balanced diet.  Good luck!
f90ca27c686e1316601b6836a8f2e32caa	So I have heard, and I am glad because that is the only exercise I get.  : )|`|gFHTcIc8aa	You can burn up to 500 cal/hr during intense lovemaking if you have a partner that can keep up with you.  It's also been known to tone hips, legs, back and shoulders.    It's also been known to stretch same muscles groups.  So tone & flexibilty will be improved.  I also like to vary my workouts, so I like to think of it as cross-training.  I guess if I had a calorie meter on, I would burn around 1000 calories/day :)    Yup Benny, women do like my oral sex skills,too. Though, I'm not sure how many calories it burns per hour.

ms0Yic7Saa	Your boobs are growing. Congrats! You have nothing to worry about. It is perfectly normal. A lot of girls get sore boobs when their boobs are growing. It happens to me too so you are definitely not alone. The only way you can get prego is my having sex, so unless you had sex your boobs are just growing. Also some girls boobs get sore and hurt when they are PMSing so that could be it but u said u just had your period. But your best bet it that they are growing.     Hope I helped!!    Good luck!!|`|VitK0Wenaa	Two weeks after your last period you are ovulating. Perfectly normal.    Sperm doesn't live very long outside the body. So the chances that you'll get pregnant for some object is slim to none.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I get sore breasts for about a week before my period - part of PMS. Maybe you don't exactly remember when you finished your last period & it was 3 weeks ago, instead of 2, or your cycle is a bit erratic & you're going to get your period early.  The only way to get pregnant without having sex is to do heavy petting where you & a boy are rubbing your private parts together and some sperm or pre-ejaculate fluid gets on you (this does happen, I read about it in Dear Abby years ago), or get invitro fertilization on purpose.|`|CgU1aQ0uaa	I am not for sure but I am always worried that using others towels and soap will randomly get m pregnant too!!|`|pPNZwbKDaa	Don't worry you can't be preg. You are probably just growing seeing as though you are 15. They are going to be sore but it's okay you'll get through it =)
PeCm21meaa	Happy birthday :)  now, it's not that you ate bad stuff.... in fact, most of the things you're eating are pretty healthy... but you aren't eating anywhere near enough.  you had under 1000 calories, which is really, really bad for you.  whether or not you are intentionally trying to starve yourself, it's still something that is beyond terrible for you and leads to all sorts of mental and physical problems.  please try to eat at least 1500 calories a day, especially when you are already so thin!|`|coZ7Fm79aa	well happy almost birthday!    as for ur eaing though the breakfast u have no protein  he lunch there's just not enough protein  the dessert why not jus regular ice cream? or have PB crackers w/ milk  dinner have 1 cup soy milk and the oatmeal and maybe some fruit    u need o eat more i think u asked a question like this before and u still need more calories in ur meals like double it to be honest
mbv2jLqDaa	I've fasted before and after the 5th day, it's very easy and you no longer feel hunger.  I currently have EDNOS, and while I have gained all of the weight back, I have fasted before and kept it off.  If you want to keep it off after fasting, break the fast very slowly with liquids, soups, and fruit/veg.  Gradually increase your caloric intake and it should stay off, just don't go crazy with it!|`|G3EVXmUAaa	i've fasted..its fine
088947ec642d33268deab793ef9d9299aa	Do a full workout. You cannot focus on one area to lose weight on. You body loses fat all over. You can do a million sit-up, have rock hard abs, but it would be under belly fat if that is all you did. Once you have the full body shape, you can tone specific muscles.|`|4d99334f60856f1567cf86a73219976aaa	You may want to check out classes the gym offers - the gym(s) I attend offer spinning, kickboxing, step aerobics, boot camp, strength & tone etc.  You want a little variety in your work out and these classes would definitely give you that.  Pilates would be great for core strengthening.  Your first couple of visits you may want to work with a trainer to get you started on a program suited to you specifically.|`|nYjJ0Pg6aa	Get an excorsist.|`|nfGo9ZARaa	You should definitely start with Cardio, i especially like the elliptical machines.  You def gotta have strength training as well because that's what keeps your metabolism revved up.  <br>  a good plan to follow is cardio 4 days of cardio and 3 days of strength training.  i would also rotate to keep the exercise interesting.  When the weather gets nice, try to go out walking about 2 miles a day and that's a good non gym workout or even throwing a Frisbee around.  most important do things that are fun so you don't want to give it up.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
P9NSk1NCaa	Take a warm bath or put a hot pad on your tummy. I would do super light easy stretches after you take a shower or put the hot pad on your stomach for about 5 minutes or lighty massage the pained area, you might just have a tight muscle that needs to be loosened near your stomach area.    Mint soothes the stomach so chew mint gum or if you have any edible mint products take that. A spoonful of honey always seems to help me  and my mom.   I would take Tylenol but it takes about 20 minutes to fully kick in or take Advil.  Sip on some water and stay away from high fatty/caffeine/sugar foods. Eat a piece of bread, the bread will absorb stomach acid that could be causing your stomachache.   Hope you feel better :)|`|83GG2y8gaa	lay a warm heating pad over your stomach..  take tylenol.  :D|`|vOc6MMa7aa	take a really hot bath and stop thickking about it if you get them alot it might be your stomace acid. in that case,bath wont help|`|kwu3TRJOaa	laugh;;it always wrks=]
ZqCWi4XLaa	Ok it looks like you have your cardio activities down and are just missing a good diet plan. You have to eat more to lose weight. No i am not crazy i just know the truth when it comes to weight lost. By eating more i mean eating more meals a day at around 5-6 instead of the 3 big meals the average person consumes. When you eat 5-6 small meals a day every three hours, your bodies metabolism increases meaning it burns off more fat. Make sure these are healthy meals do thats the most important part. Also the best method to lose weight is 20 minutes of jogging every morning before breakfast. Get 8 hours of sleep a night and drink lots of ice water.|`|8iXa1DVHaa	just eat breakfast, whatever you like. then in the afternoon go and play some soccer for like three hours straight. keep on running while you 're playing and get in the game. then when you get home, eat whatever you want and the quantity you want cuz more than likely you will be hungry. you should lose weight in a hurry. Three years ago I did this and i lost 60 pounds in three months. I wasnt on a diet or anything, i just love to play soccer and i was always hungry. its amazing how no matter what i ate and how much i ate, i still lost weight so fast. forget diets, just do this and it will work.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Simply eat a sensible diet and exercise. If I or anyone had a quick way I would be very rich. There is no quick way. If you do want to live a healthier life style then I suggest visiting your Doctor and having them recommend a dietitian for you. Trying to loose the weight to quickly can actually cause you to start retaining what you do have and open the door to eating disorders. See your doctor and make it a long term goal not one to achieve by Valentines day.
n7KCez59aa	Hi !    I suggest that you get weights that you can strap onto your ankles and wrists. Use them when you go jogging, try to jog 3-5 times a week.  Eat peanut butter, honey, baked chicken and fish, potatoes and pasta. You should try eating 6 times a day, eating small meals through out the day will help increase your appetite. It is very important that you eat breakfast, eat something like oatmeal with peanut butter and honey.|`|zRGAxkwaaa	if u wana loose weight at home without dieting and exercising  by just changing your eating habits  u can refer to  http://medifastweightlose490.notlong.com    and u ll find so many tips for weight lose n medifast detox diets  try them n loose weight easily|`|z6EyUp2vaa	well concerning the fact that you won't go to the gym is abnormal. but with a few weeks of training with your dumbbells will get you over your insecurities in no time. first when you wake up in the morning you should shower. its the mornings of champions. then you need to wear a hoodie. its what the UFC fighters do. as far as gaining muscle everywhere... you can't. you're a 15 year old girl. chill out with the bodybuilding kick. oh and why would you run to gain muscle?... answer me that.

Anything less would be a starvation diet.  How many of those calories were actually burned cannot be measured as far as I know but it would be very difficult to gain any weight on such a low calorie intake so hopefully you have lost some weight.    If you can manage on 1,200 calories per day (and most people can't) hopefully you will keep losing weight until you reach your desired weight.|`|NMihu3kgaa	It totally depends on what your body burns daily. If that is all you consumed than that means that only had about 1200 calories a day which is not alot. I wish i could only eat that much. Now you also have to put into connsideration how active you are and how many calories a day you burn. You can use a calorie calculator on the internet for that. google it! But I'm sure you couldnt have gained anything. Try and exercise if you want to lose weight. You will do great!|`|6duSMXphaa	u need to burn more calories than you consume. so if you burned 37,450 calories u lost weight :)|`|knHa8qImaa	37449/30=1248 Calories per day. That is a pretty low calorie intake. I'd be willing to bet you didn't gain any weight, but as you mentioned it depends on how many calories you burned. If you burned more calories than you consumed you lost weight, and if you consumed more than you burned you gained weight. It gets alot more complex than this with metabolism and all, but this is the simple answer.

They give painkillers for kidney stones, but an infection needs antibiotics. Don't play around see someone now.<br>  Most kidney stones are small enough to pass on their own so I don't know about the shock wave thing, I think they have to be a certain size before they use that.|`|9df0c3d38cf4defd6f7409fc7ff54947aa	What hurts is getting it out of the kidney. Once it's clear of the kidney and drops into the bladder the pain goes away. But that trip down through the kidney... Eyooww it hurts. Some they can crush and some they can't. Need to see a urologist to find out for sure.|`|AA10127184	Not an expert, but ...<br>  <br>  I've heard (from those who had them) that passing kidney stones does hurt - primarily because the process of getting them to pass is long, extending all points of pain.<br>  <br>  In theory, the shock wave treatment shouldn't hurt. I think the trouble there is the nuisance of anything they do to make it happen (I don't know if you have to drink something or get cold gel spreado n you or what - sorry).<br>  <br>  Best wishes; you'll be in my thoughts and prayers. May it go quickly and may the pain be as minimal as possible!|`|AA10047634	I've heard that the pain is comparable to childbirth, and that shockwave isn't supposed to hurt at all.

rAN3HI3Xaa	Carbohydrate = 4 calories per gram  Protein = 4 calories per gram  Alcohol = 7 calories per gram  Fat = 9 calories per gram    Hope i helped =]|`|pjYQhPPBaa	There are 4 kcal/1 g of carbohydrates. Sugar is a carbohydrate. So that would be 76 calories.
5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people. You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|5TnN9sBXaa	your right no meds but you cant because no matter wat its your parent who stress you fix that
EJQRIffaaa	plenty of fish in the sea,     thats a long list of complaints, is there anything you like about him, too balance that stuff out if not dump him and move on with your own life
DnU64Aobaa	Yes, you can overwork your muscles!    When you work out you are essentially breaking and rebuilding your muscle tissue. Your body uses protein to repair the damage that occurs when working out. If you over train, you are potentially causing more muscle damage than your body is able to repair. This can lead to injury and seriously set back your training.    You need to plan a regime. Go to a gym and see what they say for training. It is going to take longer to get to your peak than a month but you may see some improvements.    Good luck!|`|1keH3R6paa	Maybe not "do any good" but definitely sore and aching. Watch your limits.
7sOnwrotaa	about 2 or 3 pounds a week is good...try green tea for losing weight too...it's good for you and helps you lose :)|`|pQNwuyuvaa	Weight loss hypnosis program helps you loss the weight you want and keep it off forever.|`|AgiwOGbUaa	Actually you should eat something light before bed(about 15g of protein, 15g of carbs, and 20g of fat). Like a protein bar. Your body digests muscle and lean muscle before it digests fat, so if you have a light meal before bed, your body will digest that and you'll minimize the amount of muscle you lose at night while you sleep.     The more muscle you have, the more fat you burn. Drink more water, drink more water, drink more water. Get crystal light or any of the 290839023820 brands of water flavoring powders. You can carry a few in your bag or pockets and just get a bottle of water to put it into. Watch the ones with sugar and caffeine though!  Cut out any items in your diet that have aspartame, or ANY unnatural, man-made sugar in them. They still raise your blood-sugar and that can cause you to gain weight....Wait    That was off the subject. You should lose 1-2LB a week to be healthy, if you workout, do half cardio and half weight training(or strength training). Build lean muscle and you're on the right track :)...sorry that I went crazy.|`|8CCttFS6aa	It is probably easiest to keep weight off if it is lost slowly because that usually indicates a very gradual change in lifestyle/nutrition choices. If you made a drastic change, you would be more likely to resort to your old ways. I think this is a great, healthy way to lose weight and keep it off, and I would also reccomend eating lots of fiber, it's incredibly filling. But don't be too restrictive, keep doing what you're doing. Do not aim for more than a few pounds a week.
ETcBRko3aa	Scars   Lack of trust  Hyperviligiance   Fear of loud noises  Dissociation  Lack of close relationships  Pushing people away  Substance abuse  Eating disorders  Self-harm|`|01422986073bb1352f22e7c8ebaaaeacaa	There are various signs, like depression, fear, phobias, terrible relationship with parents, are just some. You can watch a parenting video on signs of child abuse and it's effects in www.SaberHacer.com|`|0TGpz08paa	If they tell you that they were abused. I really don't know. I was physically abused and sexually abused, and I don't have ABUSE VICTIM written on my forehead but people say that I am very shy and reserved and I look like I have gone through a lot and that I seem to keep a lot inside..which I do. But abuse victims are usually normal people who were just unlucky and went through hell.

How will it be free?  Even insurance doesn't pay for tests you don't need.....My friend had a mammogram, turned out fine, but she felt something was wrong.  She finally got a doctor to approve an MRI and they found breast cancer.  But insurance won't pay for any of it b/c the mamogram was clean and didn't catch it......
3e18d3cd73af9870a36618105fdb7640aa	average. to be fit, you would want your body fat percentage to be more like 18 or 19... so your pretty close.|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	Wow, that's really good. You are considered to be ideal in terms of your body composition.<br>  <br>  I'm also 5ft2 and about 10lb lighter than you, but have 2% more body fat. I'm jealous!!<br>  <br>  Take care : )|`|95357efc3ba8d7fb66c1e91e89a10e05aa	Okay....3,500 calories to burn one pound of fat<br>  You keep a journal of your food intake..I think its highly important for you to see on paper the numbers of what you are taking in.<br>  <br>  You buy a calorie counting watch..You take your total intake calories +3,500 add them together and THAT is what you need to burn everyday..to burn one pound.<br>  <br>  If you start seeing the numbers I think it will help see that alot of what you might eat..may be uneccesary. You have to remember that your stomach and your intake of food at one meal sitting should be the size of your fist. It doesn't take much food to maintain your health. You can have 5 to 6 servings of healthy food the size of your fits over three regular huge meals. Your body is like a conveyer belt. You need a little at a time to keep everything moving. Good Luck|`|AA12047640	You're average. 131 is kind of heavy for 5'2 but if it is muscle and not fat that is a completely different issue.|`|NRvriAgEaa	I am going to admit I am way out of shape, so i'm going to go with my thoughts on what you've described, and some things I learned in health class.  Women are going to have a higher percentage of body fat, considering breasts and hips and buttocks by biology, so I would imagine your within line to being just about perfectly healthy.  I would recommend checking with a doctor to be positive, but sounds like your on the right track.

8YOE7VvLaa	The best way to lose that ab flab we all loathe and hate is to start lifting weights.    Lifting weights only makes you big and muscly if you eat more!  If you eat the same, it helps you burn fat mega quick!  In October I started weight training every 2nd day, and by the start of November, I lost so much body fat, I could see my 6 pack for the 1st time in my life!    Weight lifting increases your body's metabolic rate so you burn more calories during the day.  This means that even if you still eat the same ammount, because the ammount of calories your body is burning is higher, the calorie defecit (ie. the calories you expend - the calories you consume) is much greater so you lose fat faster! :)    Good luck!|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	hey me too. here is a idea you can only eat yogurt and soup and other soft things. I lost SEVEN pounds of that. I'm not fat though.|`|nuLF8SqBaa	lots of water and exercise

ru9eqfEYaa	Hard to say, best thing is to ask your dentist. I'd say after only dipping a year and half you wouldn't have cancer, but anything is possible.  I've been dippin for almost 3 years, and i always want to quit, but you know how that goes. Everyone's body is different, some people can chew their whole lives and not get anything. I also sometimes get those pains, however i went to the dentist a month ago, and they took x-rays and everything..told me everything was GREAT. i wouldn't sweat it man.  Good LUCK.|`|6mSfRjpxaa	Chances you have a viral infection and your lymph system is doing what it is suppose to. The swollen lymph node indicates that your body if fighting an illness. The chance that you have oral cancer, at your age, is pretty slim. However, tell your dentist and let him/her check out your mouth.|`|u12eVaDhaa	Sounds like a trapped nerve to be honest.    Don't worry - they go on their own.    You are young and you didn't chew tabacco for long.  I'm sure your body will recover and you'll be fine.  Just don't go back to it or smoke, or drink excessively.  Drinking too much can cause mouth cancer just as well as smoking or chewing tabacco.    Best wishes

4rcua9Ujaa	It would depend on a lot of other factors especially your age and wether you are looking to do it proffesionally. If you are I would advise you to call up your nearest coaching centre and schedule an appointment with one of the trainers who would be able to asses you and give you more comprehensive advise. Even if they say that you are not suitable ask for some costructive critisism (such as you are not flexible enogh) and then go and work on that area. If you are looking to do this just as a hobby than it really doesn't matter. Your dedication will over ride any physical disadvanteges.

P9NSk1NCaa	How long has he had these headaches?  Has he hit his head at all? If so and if the headaches have been continuing for over a week get him to the hospital and demand a cat scan, he could have fluid in this brain,concussion or swelling or brain.   Is he eating properly? Make sure he's drinking enough water and getting enough calories because that causes headaches and light headiness: can make your vision off and blurry.  Does he get mad or stressed easily or big event coming up? Stress could be causing the headaches.  Since he has a cold he might be getting some sinus pressure or something too causing his forehead to hurt. Apply a warm compress to his forehead to loosen up the gunk causing the pressure.     I would tell your friend to take ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) or Tylenol or Aleve to relieve his headache and take the recommended doses    I found a website if you want to research more about headaches.   http://www.medicinenet.com/headache/arti...    I would tell your friend to go back to the doctor if he doesn't improve in a couple days.     I hope your friend feels better soon :)|`|fQgbBx7caa	Sinus problems you mentioned the eye area, I do this......ask the Dr. or pharmacist what to take.|`|VNvVhDWgaa	It could be a sinus headache, so he may want to get some over the counter stuff to boost the speed of any antibiotics that they may have given him. Specifically looking for sinus relief.    If, after his cold goes away and he is still having the headaches, then he needs to return to his doctor to make sure that his sinuses are not clogged and infected.    If that doesn't work, the thing with his eye hurting with the headache would lead me to think that, if it isn't his sinuses, he may be having migraines. However, it's more likely to be a sinus issue at this stage.    The best relief he can get is to get the over the counter sinus medication, rest a lot, and perhaps put a cool cloth over his eyes while the headache is going on. Maybe take some tylenol with it to help ease up the pain, or aleve or advil. It will likely go away with the cold. They probably have him on antibiotics, and more than likely, that will take care of it.
nZ4u47ZVaa	Maybe your not exercising enough....but don't drop your calorie level. Your metabolism sounds a little slow and food boosts up your metabolism so keep eating at least 1200 cals a day.|`|tQGRJBYAaa	I did that and I gained 2 pounds in a few days because it makes your body store food as fat.
cf42ad33feef58c69f4ccb580fc3c0c0aa	For me the 3rd shot did hurt the worst.  Your arm will probably be sore for a few days, but all shots bring some amount of pain.  The medicine stings a little when going in and then the muscle will be sore However I have had kidney stones and I would take 100 gardisil shots before having kidney stones again.    You've already had the first two, you can make it through the 3rd.  It's fast and once it's over you should feel happy about taking steps to help protect yourself.  Good luck!

If you see white stuff, then you can pop it a litte but don't get obsessive about it.  It can make it worse sometimes.  Proctive, Clean & Clear, and almost everything else I have tried left me with a red mark that took months to go away.  A lot of products that they sell for acne are very irratating for sensitive skin.  Use a very gentle face wash.  I woudn't use anything that says it is for acne. Use face washes that say they are for sensitive skin.  You might find that once you eliminate all the harsh products then you skin will get a lot better.|`|eVNIRAnXaa	you  should try desert essence   thoroughly clean face wash with an exfoliation glove  it works so good .you can buy it at trader joes
AG9msdUDaa	"Weaning off paxil needs to be VERY slow. The initial step is usually to cut the dose in half. This level should be stayed at until all symptoms of withdrawal are gone. This can take 2-3 weeks. Once stabilized at that level drop in half again. Wait 2-3 weeks again. Follow this pattern. DO NOT GO TO EVERY OTHER DAY OR EVERY THIRD DAY!!! Paxil's halflife is only 21 hours so by skipping days you are throwing yourself into withdrawal every other or every third day. Much better to consistently lower the dosage on a daily schedule."  http://allnurses.com/psychiatric-nursing...    So considering you have just started this medication, the first time you half your dose, I don't imagine that you will have withdrawal symptoms for 2-3 weeks, but maybe 2-3 days, but still, do this very carefully because the withdrawal is very very uncomfortable. By halving your dose you will hopefully half the severity of the withdrawal as compared to going cold turkey.|`|AA11091145	You could probably quit easiy after five days.  If you feel withdrawls, take a half tablet every other day for a couple of days.    Your doctor will probably tell you to tough it out for two weeks and the side effects go away.  While that is true for a lot of antidepressants(things get better after two weeks), paxil is very sedating.  I did nothing but sleep while on it.|`|AA12310760	eugh, i been on paxil for 7 days :( !! and i feel so out of it and sick!!!!!.  :(    i am going to talk to my doctor about maybe taking something else instead and you should do the same. normally they don't recommend  just quitting cold turkey but since you only been on it for 5 days i really don't think you will experience withdrawal symptoms. if  not  just wait it out till monday so you can talk to you doctor. :(|`|Q5RyzftZaa	You will not suffer withdraws in this short of time. Although it is normal to have these feelings when you begin with paxil till it regulates your serotonin's it usually takes 2 weeks to get better.

kpi69PHWaa	If your blood has a high sodium content, water enters the blood vessels to attempt to balance it out. This deprives cells of water throughout the body. This imbalance also changes things in the kidney. Rather than the water being collected in the urinary collecting system, the water is resorbed and continues to circulate. This increase of volume increases the pressure in the blood vessels.     This also explains why when you're dehydrated, your urine will be dark gold rather than pale gold. If your kidneys are putting water back into circulation rather than getting rid of it, what the kidneys do get rid of is much more concentrated.|`|0IuWhmWUaa	sodium absorbs water in blood, thickening it.

xyWe7BFqaa	I lost my virginity when I was 20, but that really doesn't matter because it is important for you to have sex when YOU feel ready--regardless of when your friends do. Your hymen (cherry) may break when you do it, but chances are good (especially if you are athletic or were an athletic child) that it is already broken. You may bleed, but probably not. And yes, it will probably hurt at least a little, and if it hurts you may walk a bit different to compensate for the pain for a small amount of time.     There will be less pain if you use lube. I would recommend a silicon-based lube, because they have no taste or smell and don't dry out. You can get a bottle for $4 at Planned Parenthood. Whatever you do, do NOT used oil-based lube (no lotions, creams, or kitchen condiments) because these will eat the latex in the condom and it won't be effective.    PLEASE do not use a flavored/scented condom for vaginal sex!!! These contain glucose (sugar) and could give you a yeast infection.|`|b3MtlxSEaa	15, virgin and proud.

It is actually more satisfying when you wait...  Don't fall for a teenage boy, because more than likely, he will hurt you emotionally, then you will wish that you had never had sex with him. And you'll never be able to change what happened.    Please....don't do it!  you might be thinking "no he would never do that, he loves me"  NO! stop thinking that right now! a boy does not know what love is, and neither do you. that boy would not die for you. that boy would not be at your bedside if you ever got sick. that boy is only looking for someplace to put it! Please, take it from someone that KNOWS and from someone that has BEEN THERE!|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	17.    I didn't bleed, I guess my hymen was broken beforehand.

It doesn't hurt when they put them on.  Take Advil after your appointment for braces so you don't have any [ain after four hours. Eat soft foods for 2 weeks then you can start eating other stuff. Here is some information about braces.

PRECEDURE TO PUT ON BRACES  1. They put some glue stuff on your teeth.  2. They put in a plastic thing in your mouth.  3. They get the brackets and start putting them on your teeth one by one.  4. They shine your teeth with a UV blue light to harden the glue.  5. After they put on all the brackets on they put in the wire and put in the rubber bands (color of your choice) in.   6. Then they are done!!!     DO'S  1. Do brush your teeth at least 3-5 per day  2. Do floss everytime you brush.  3. Do if there is a loose wire or bracket or a wire poking you schedule a appointment ASAP  4. Do eat soft foods for the first few days.  5. Do cut fruit into small pieces.     DON"T'S  1, Don't eat hard foods.  2. Don't chew gum.  3. Don't stress over it.     FOODS YOU CANNOT EAT  1. popcorn  2. gum  3. carmel  4. apple (whole)  5. Ice  6.nuts  7. peanut brittle  8.hard pizza crust  9. corn on cob  10. ribs  11. chips  12. hard pretzels  13. hard rolls and bagels  14. raw carrots  15. beef jerky  16. corn nuts   17. suckers    There are no needles or shots involved in this procedure.

P9NSk1NCaa	How long does the pain last?  You might just be getting major muscle spasms, have you been working out a lot or sitting down a bunch?  Are you getting a rash or bruising on the area?  It might be a blood clot in your leg or something in your leg is pinching a nerve so it causes pain  I would talk to your doctor a.s.a.p because this has happened twice now, but for now i would recommend elevating your leg up, putting a cool compress onto the hurt area, and taking an Aleve or Tylenol for the pain. Make sure your getting all your vitamins and drinking enough water!  I hope you feel better soon :)|`|f74919b7d41b116deeee167f1f457e92aa	If you find that strange sensations in your legs keep you from sleeping or cause you to jump up and move around to relieve the discomfort, you may have Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). RLS is a central nervous system disorder that can interfere with resting or falling asleep.    Various treatments help with RLS. For some people, self-help tips decrease the discomfort, and for others, more treatment is necessary. Regardless, you can find relief.

Why did you go to med school? To make daddy proud, the money, or some much needed confidence? Enjoy your lifetime of debt and your struggle to feel like a man. <br>  <br>  My response.....<br>  <br>  I find it amazing that a person who is in a field supposedly dedicated to compassion could be so objectively venomous.  FYI I have no aspirations of pleasing my father and not subject to blunt Freudian attacks by those who are obviously not my equal.  Nor do I need the money or the compensation.  You know nothing about me and are making a blind attack.  Your question and aggressive attitude simply proves to me that I'm right about you specifically, and most nurses in general.  Angry, pampered, underworked, self righteous and overpaid.  Go cry to your union about your work hours.  <br>  <br>  To quote you from a previous question you have answered regard chosing between money and family, you said, "I would consider this if it were for a lot more money. 144,000 a year isn't that much to lose time you will never get back with your family." <br>  <br>  You write something like this and have the audacity to question my motivation and family relationships.  Interesting to say the least.<br>   <br>  Considering you probably work 1/4 the time of the average medical staff, you need to get over yourself, you're not that important.  There are thousands of nurses who enjoy their work who would gladly take your place.<br>  <br>  Your immature attack on me again, solidifies my opinion of most nurses.  My suggestion to you would be to grow up.<br>  <br>  I could easily ask why you went to nursing school...  however I'm sure I wouldn't be surprised at the answer.  Nor do I really care, you have proven who you are to me.  Enjoy your lifetime of servitude and anger.|`|AA11754660	I work graveyard shift and I don't do too bad with it.

It's hard when you have to hold over or come in early but if you can keep it to around the same 12 hour schedule each day, your body should start maintaining it naturally.

ffe668ec630e0c0e5e6fedb1f31a5ee7aa	It might help a little bit, but it's more likely to just make you sleepy. Another user suggested Klonopin, which will help too, but it's not a cure-all. Honestly though, Ativan would probably be the best option if you're considering benzodiazepines, which you shouldn't be. If it's really bad, you're going to have to go and see a psychiatrist and see if you have Social Anxiety disorder or a related condition. If you do, the treatment plan for Social Anxiety disorder is usually some type of SSRI and therapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy).

It can be a little intimidating to go to the gym, especially when you see people in really good shape and you start comparing yourself to them.  Don't.  You should know the reasons you are there, and how you are going to accomplish them.  And sometimes, if you go to the gym at the same time, you'll run into the same people ... you might be able to have conversations that will help you learn more about the equipment and ways to get healthy.  Gyms are intended to put people together to achieve a common goal, which is to live better.

I do body cleansing.  I lost 13 pounds in  9 days and then 28 pounds in less than a month. Cleansing will help the body get rid of impurities.  Impurites come from a lot of things like fast food, pollution, food additives and preservatives etc.  The impurities get stored in the fat in our body.  To shrink the fat, we have to get rid of the impurities by cleansing.  This made sense to me and I decided to try a cleanse program and it worked.  The weight came off fast and this kept me motivated to keep going, not like other diets where the weight loss it too slow.

pjgQAXM7aa	Oh yeah totally, eating little meals every 3-4 hours really does work. I was on that routine for almost a year, but then it drove me crazy that I didn't know how to be hungry anymore. So then I just went back to eating 3 meals a day and some snacks whenever I was hungry. But that's just my story, and my brain so... Yeah, the diet works haha. I don't know about the grape thing though, because then you would for sure get tired of it. You won't get hungry eating after 3-4 hours; TRUST ME. For example, instead of eating a regular WHOLE sandwich, eat half and save the other half for 3-4 hours later.    EDIT: Oh you want to lose weight? Then going with the 3-4 eating hour routine will help you big time because then you won't be snacking on anything unnecessary, which will probably save you about 400 calories each day. Adding exercise will clearly help you too. I'm more of a lazy person, so I just like to do cardiovascular work outs; walking/jogging.

This way your metabolism speeds up to help you burn more calories. You may need to burn more calories in the day, rather than just working out...do some more cardio. don't do the grape thing, cause there are not very nutritious calories in each grape you eat, so you may not gain weight, but you won't be eating healthy either...which could diminish you muscle size.|`|10b31d7109a360752e8863b0bf89ca6faa	Well "eat little" makes me nervous. You are right that you don't want to starve the body or risk going into starvation mode. If you will post or send me your age, weight, and activity level, I can calculate your base metabolic rate (  calories your body burns in a day). You can also google search metabolic rate calculator. You should eat roughly 300-500 calories less per day to lose weight in a controlled and healthy manner.     When you eat, it should be 5-6 smaller meals a day. You don't want to snack all the time or you'll risk over eating, but 5-6 meals a day will keep your metabolism running in peak mode.|`|FBaHcWMlaa	eating little meals dont work often . its a bit unhealthy for your body.  try working out|`|a3p72VmDaa	yes|`|bGsCzXSlaa	Don't eat anything if your on a diet.

69SHxWA9aa	I used to try and find the center, and use a sewing needle to create a hole in the center to let out the puss.    Then clean the area with a mixture of 50% hydrogen peroxide and 50% water, to kill the bacteria.    If I did this before it got big, then it would not get any larger.    To keep the pores clear, try soaking in a warm bath twice a week.  Treat the infected areas by cleaning with a cotton ball or Q-tip with some hydrogen peroxide solution with 50% water.  Make only about 1 ounce at a time, and toss what is not needed with 15 minutes of mixing it, as dipping in the q-tip will add bacteria to the mixture.  It will become not so effective after a short time.    Good Luck!|`|M5XjqI40aa	Draw a smiley face on it and give it a toupee.

Boils (furuncles) usually start as red, tender lumps. The lumps quickly fill with pus, growing larger and more painful until they rupture and drain. A carbuncle is a cluster of boils that form a connected area of infection under the skin.     You can usually care for a single boil at home, but don't attempt to lance or squeeze it  that may spread the infection. Call your doctor if a boil or carbuncle is extremely painful, lasts longer than two weeks or occurs with a fever. Talk to your pharmacist about any over the counter medications that you can use.

Ovarian cancer would be incredibly rare at your age and would be the LEAST likely cause for your pain. Your symptoms do sound more like they could be a result of cysts that are either on or in your ovaries.     Ovulation pain is likely to be something that one has always experienced rather than it just starting, however in rare cases it can occur years after menarche. Mid cycle bleeding that is persistent should always be investigated. Your Doctor will need to arrange for you to have a scan (which he has done), and perhaps even a laparoscopy- to have a look around inside. That is the only real way to exclude pathology- blood tests alone wouldn't, although they could indicate problems like PCOS. Try not to worry, as I said above it would be HIGHLY unusual at your age for it to be anything sinister.    You mentioned nerve pain down your leg? This sounds like it could be sciatica- your back pain might not be related to the pain you are experiencing in your ovary.You need to have the scan and take things from there. I have suffered from anxiety issues myself in the past and as typical Nurse I am completely paranoid about any new pain or sensation! You just have to say to yourself that at least things are being investigated and the chances of this being a cancerous outcome are indeed very slim.|`|sn0V6bXAaa	I understand what you're going through. It sounds more like Ovarian cysts. The scans would check for cysts around the ovaries and they should be able to tell if they are fluid filled or solid.  Blood work will pick up some indications too for something more serious, so I'm sure your doctor will do whatever is necessary to rule out the worst (but I seriously doubt you have anything to worry about).     I just discovered one myself and had almost identical symptoms that you're stating. Having ovarian cysts are very very normal - they can come and go, they can come in different sizes and affect your cycle differently, etc. Most are benign (meaning they are not cancerous), and very few are malignant - they do blood work/scans to look for any indicators like that. Try to relax - I understand the anxiety issue as well. I hate having anything physically wrong with me, sends my head into a tailspin especially since I'm studying to become a nurse and sometimes having certain information does NOT help!     Let me ask you - do you have pain or cramping when you exercise? Especially during ovulation? That's a classic sign of cysts too.

Then go over it again but this time with the sticky side down this is so that when you remove the tape if your finger is still hurting it wont injure it more. But be sure you only tape it lightly.

ZqCWi4XLaa	im going to be honest with you. It is impossible to lose 10 pounds in 10 days let alone off your stomach. The thing about belly fat is it is impossible to isolate it. Meaning you have to lose weight throughout your whole body by doing alot of cardio. And the worst part is belly fat is the last on the list when your body is burning fat. Realistically at best you will shed 1-2 pounds a week which means that u would need atleast 5 weeks to achieve your goal not 10 days. I would start by jogging for 20 minutes every morning before breakfast and keep a fast metabolism by eating 5-6 small meals a day instead of the three big meals. Drink lots of water especially iced because this will increase metabolism.|`|kmwZnASgaa	lipo      works wonders in MUCH less than 10 days|`|39DbDiagaa	wish i could help...im in the same situation|`|eifnAdTtaa	that's impossible. if you want to lose weight, you have to try and work out for a long time.  i believe 2 weeks is possible to lose about 5 lb, but not 10..    but try this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eOdcFVrF...    i'm on day 6 and it feels great. good luck!
8asG4WCwaa	There are many conditions that can cause severe cramps, so you may want to bug your doctor about it and see if you can go to a neurologist.      Cramping like you describe runs in my family (many of them also diabetic, but not all), and we've seen so many supposed causes and cures that were worthless.  I've been lucky in that I only have mild episodes compared to the rest of them (most of whom have passed on now), but you can bet if one of my kids developes the condition, they'll be in a neurologist's office pretty quick.  With what we know today about conditions like MS, MD, ALS, and many other diseases, I'm convinced this is where our family should be looking for help.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	A common issue for diabetics is neuropathy but cramps can come from something much more simple like a vitamin or mineral deficiency.  If your control is poor and you have alot of high sugars, you may be low in potassium.  Being low in potassium causes horrible cramps in the legs, feet, and hands.  It is very dangerous and can cause heart attacks.  Talk to your doctor as a simple blood test can rule this out.  I would not run to the neurologist just yet, see what your family doc says first.  It could be something simple like a nutritional issue.|`|Q5RyzftZaa	It actually sounds like you may be getting neuropathy in your legs this is very painful. and another thing is to check you sugar levels if they are out of control this can be another cause.  some diabetic meds can cause this as well.|`|9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	Hi! I am a diabetic and a diabetes educator. Your potassium is low. Remember when you were first diagnosed? Your doctor probably gave you potassium supplements. Call your diabetes educator or nurse practitioner and ask to see the nutritionist. Also you need a current A1c and blood work. You may be developing further complications such as nerve damage too, but more than likely you need supplements and follow up.     Also get checked for Celiac disease as it runs with T1. In this case you would not be absorbing food correctly and you would need vitamin supplements and a special diet for treatment. I have both T1 and celiacs and I have treated my own cramps with diet, personally.     Go to the doctor and get some help for this. Nerve problems do not cause cramping very often, more likely pain and a burning feeling.    Take care!

V3mpzjcuaa	Totally normal and totally hot!    A former partner got REALLY wet like you when we had sex.  She put down a super absorbent towel underneath when we had sex.  Especially when we had sex somewhere else (like in her sisters living room or in the car).  The towel soaked up all the wetness and made clean up faster.      She was a squirter too.  Ah, the memories.    Peace.|`|VitK0Wenaa	Completely normal. Actually, the wetness is nature's way of making you more fertile.     Not to worry. Most men like it.|`|A0825FVZaa	Yep!

pIvN6TY7aa	It's not too much. I eat considerably more, and I'm generally considered slender.     I'm concerned because it's composed almost entirely of refined wheat flour, with a good shot of sugar and fats.  Almost no protein.    Please, eat plain shredded wheat (with bran, I would suggest. Available bite-size) and add sugar or honey to taste.  And other wholegrain foods.  That gives you roughage, so you don't get constipated, and to prevent colorectal cancer and a number of other ailments.  Also vitamins and minerals you won't get from most other foods. Dairy products (cheese or yogurt, if you're lactose-intolerant), because you need the calcium to prevent osteoporosis (breaks little old ladies' hips, and other parts, too). Fruits and vegetables.  Lots of satisfaction and (except for avocados and nuts), no fats. Lots of roughage, vitamins & minerals.    If you want to check, calculate the calories you're taking in. You need about 2000 calories/day.  Check with your doctor to be sure.    The issue of how much you eat is important, but it's also very important to eat foods that give you the nutrients your body needs.    If you feel a need to be obsessive about food issues, try to make sure that you're eating foods that give you enough fibre, Vitamin D and calcium. Chances are that if you can accomplish that, you're getting the nutrients you need.|`|41pEmKyzaa	NO.... not at all..!!

o81jR8Wnaa	It'd be easier if you stood up.  Most women can stand to pee very easily, but it sounds like your urethra points forward more than some women's urethras.

To get some mass into you you have to eat like every 2-3hours and make sure you have a big breakfast that has lots of carbs and protein cause you need that energy for the whole day and also every snack or meal you eat make sure its got enough carbs and protein.

It's completely normal when you switch (or start) birth control to "spot". I've been on 3 different types since I started 5 years ago and every time I've switched I spotted for over a month, but then it stopped for good. Just check with your doctor (you can always call your doctor to ask questions). If it helps, make a list of questions and then present them all at once.

How do the doctors say how he is doing?       It really does depend on his treatment and how his body reacts.    Youngins have passed from it before and so has others.I do remember a case of a six month old who survived salmonella poisoning, so that should give you hope.    If he is alright now, he will more than likely recover.Usually, a major concern with salmonella and other illnesses is dehydration.There is a chance the bacteria can make its way into the blood but like I said, if he is under doctors care, he should be alright.      Is he just having diarrhea or has he vomited too?

YQ9YXcEkaa	The Hodgkin's "itch" is very particular -- it is a deep itching feeling, below the skin, that no amount of scratching, topical lotion, etc. will relieve.  Nothing I've ever had before quite feels like it.  I literally scratched the skin on my chest where I had "the itch" until it bled.  I had no rash associated with the area that itched.    Normal lymph nodes are usually 1 cm or smaller.  You do have palpable nodes that you can feel if you hunt around in your neck, arm pit, and groin.  It is normal to be able to feel these nodes.    Hodgkin's Disease can start anywhere, but it very often first presents in the chest as a mediastinal mass or as enlarged chest nodes.  That is likely why your doctor is suggesting a chest x-ray.  If you're going to continue to worry, I would probably do the chest x-ray -- it would likely show enlarged nodes if this was Hodgkin's.    In your favor, Hodgkin's Disease is fairly rare -- there's only about 8,000 cases diagnosed a year.|`|KKh8rikGaa	You didn't state your age but you need to talk to your parents again, it could be nothing or  something that needs attention now, why take chances with your health|`|ps8H35yXaa	My Hodgkin's intch was a lil different...for a long long long time, I thought it was just irritation to soap, peftume and dyes.  I just thought my skin was sensitive.  But, my itch was primarily on my legs...and nothing I did, would help.  I litterally took bottle caps to scratch the hell out of em, because the itch was so bad.  My skin began to get "red-ish" on different parts, my chest for instance.  But I never had a rash where my legs itched.  I would assume though, everyone's different.    I had been long suffering with a lot of bizzare and unusual symptoms for a long time, at least 6+ months...itchy, sore and sensitve legs were one of them.  Along with having no appetite, a low grade fever, numbness and tingling (on my left side where my cancer was discovered)..,a few months before I was diagnosed I felt a lump near my left clavicle that was the size of a grape (3cm).  I went in for testing after 2 rounds of anti-biotics (which are a waste of time in my opinion), followed by a CT scan (which revealed swollen mediastinal lymph node swelling as well as swollen lymph nodes in underarm and neck)    The only way to tell for certain if you have Hodgkin's is a biopsy.  They can get a good idea what's going on from an x-ray/CT but to be for 100% certain, you have to get a biopsy.    What was very funny was that 2 months prior to getting diagnosed for stage 2b Hodgkin's Lymphoma I went to the ER.  My blood tests indicated nothing accept that I was anemic.  I was told to take an iron supplement and go see my regular Doctor.  If they would have just done a CT/chest x-ray they could have been able to tell.    A chest x-ray would give you a lil bigger understanding if maybe you do have mediastinal swelling.  Most Hodgkin's cases involve swelling in that particular node (the large long shaped node that rests between your lungs)    Are you having any other symptoms?  Loss of appetite, bruising, fever, fatigue, weight loss, anything out of the ordinary?  Listen to your body, and let your doctor know if you have anything else going on.      If your lymph nodes have been swollen for over a month and you're starting to itch, I would get the x-ray just to be on the safe side.  Chest x-rays are only around 200 something dollars, and really if you are having problems, your doctor should have opted for one to be on the safe side anyways.
lkkelozXaa	There are two different types of lazy eyes..Strabismus and Amblyopia.  Amblyopia is when there is a problem seeing out of one eye and not the other, hence the good eye is patched so that the out of focus eye works harder to bring it into sync.  You have glasses/contacts so your eye doctor would of noticed this problem in an exam.  Have they ever mentioned this to you?  You definitely need a professional to examine your eyes and refer you for the proper treatment and or vision therapy services.

7223c8a4f7ee5b761999e41345be647faa	Start slowly do 10 to 15 minutes of stretching then go for a mile or two walk or run. Then do 3 sets each (10 each time) of push ups and sit ups. Then do some more stretches, as this gets easier increase how far you run or walk and how many sets of push ups and sit ups you do. The most important part of all this is to have patients losing weight takes time. Also always eat a good breakfast it gets your metabolism going and helps you burn fat through out your day but don't eat to much. It is also important to drink lots of water and this will also help you lose weight.
325dc58fe0dad7a757aae14664382449aa	There's a saying that goes "first place on, last place off."      For girls that usually means butt and thighs.  But some girls store it around the middle like guys do.    Lift weights three days per week and do long cardio (at least 20 minutes) two days per week.    Eat six small meals per day sticking to meat and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, some starch, no sugar.    If a carbohydrate is white (white bread, pastry, pasta, etc.) you don't need to eat it.      Drink lots of water.  One large glass with each of your six meals.|`|BXLCiCUlaa	you cant just lose fat from one region. Just try harder to lose fat by doing intense cardio and eating less than you burn, its the only way. Also dont forget to drink plenty of water and get enough sleep and avoid sugary foods. After all, have you ever seen someone walking around with 6 pack abs and chubby arms and face? Sure would be a funny sight to see.

If you get them that often though tou may want to check it out  with your doctor, it can mean other serious problems as well.
61Qbxn0Eaa	yes it is safe.  if you take meds to fix it however...then your bf should take them at the same time as well.  if not you will just keep passing it back and forth.    natural remedies include hydrogen peroxide diluted with 50% water.    also you can use "live culteres" yogurt.  just stick it up there and the bacteria will kill the infection.  if you go this way, you might as well have some fun and get your man to apply it to both himself and to and inside of you and then have sex to help to really get in in there.    bonus pts cuz its edible!!  a lady parfait anybody?  yummy!  lol|`|w4zjmhxoaa	You can pass the infection to your partner.

NOT A 12 YEAR OLD BOY!! you are not fat. you are probably a little under weight. my inches are 36, 27,42. and i'm 140.   you need to stop listing to what america thinks is "the right size" because one day you'll realize that america is saying to be a small size, but there telling use to over eat. selling you food, to sell the cure for the weight you've gained from what THEY told you to eat.  go to the doctor and ask him/her if you're at a healthy size and if not, then what you should range in.   silly. I was vegan and i once weight 113, don't know how or why because i was Way too skinny. i had no breasts, or but, i looked like a little boy. i was passing out all the time i bruised easily. not pretty. not i've had heart problems, and i realize that people will tell you when you look the best. i've gotten more compliments being at 140 and curved and grown into my woman body. i get more stares, and hit ons. and i feel sexy. you'll realize it one day.|`|j7WNkQIaaa	You are NOT fat!

If you would still like a good plan you should try to eat 6 small meals spread through the day, combined with regular exercise. it's all about PORTION CONTROL. Just think about your choices before making them and try to exercise at least 20 minutes-a-day. Switch up running, biking and swimming. Don't forget to stretch and drink A LOT of water. You'll be in shape in no time.    One of the best plans I've ever used is the "Body for Life."|`|VZ83TZtTaa	You thing that's fat?

XUPuNAPlaa	I think its good that you're trying to volunteer to get your mind out of this family issue.  I hope you get to meet nice caring people.  Whatis happening between your mom and you is not fair for you, and I agree that you should talk to a counselor at school to get more support.  It might feel stressful for you to experience this.  I can only hope that you find other interests for yourself and focus on these as much as you can.     Your mom will have to find a counselor and deal with it.   maybe your father is not able to deal with the situation with your mother.  I suggest either do something fun only with  your dad (without mom around) without talking about her kinda to forget about it.  He's going to have to deal with it one day but right now i think he feels helpless.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	UUHH i know how you feel,...kinda. I'm diabetic .. But if you feel like you're not getting enough food, eat what you want..  Your mom does not know how you feel, if your hungry or not....talk to her. Also, you need to work on somethings with your relationship with your dad|`|8oPVcYSyaa	I have the same problem alwayz trying 2 help people but not reallying helping myself. I have friends but since i have trust issues only 2 of my friends REALLY know me and the life i live.       try standing up 2 her, or do u have any aunts that u can talk 2, girl cousins talk 2 them if not      you can talk 2 me, trust me we r one in the same|`|7ef1S7zbaa	I know how you feel but you should talk to your mom about this and if she doesn't listen find someone who will a counselor or someone you trust to talk to. Oh and I would take your father with you all 3 of you go in and talk to a counselor with this issue. That way your father can listen to what you are feeling and your mom can heal herself from her eating disorder. There's help out there for people with eating disorders. It's a matter of life or death for your mother. I've seen YouTube videos of people with anorexia and what they look like and it's not pretty. I've gone through the depressed stage maybe not as bad as your case here but I know the emotional toll it can take on a person. I hope your mom gets well soon and peace is restored in your family.
RoDjZKknaa	Don't use an emery board or anything else to try and smooth the tooth yourself.  You could cause more chipping and damage.  If it is sensitive I have heard that sugarless gum is helpful, but I wouldn't use it myself, chance of choking on it during the night.  I would just try and avoid the area with my tongue and get to your dentist Monday morning.  I have seen many a patient with chipped and sharp teeth wait several weeks to have it checked (they chip it and know they are coming in for their cleaning soon, so they wait) they don't have issues as long as they are careful..  I'm thinking you can last the weekend if you are mindful.     good luck|`|f9sL3WgQaa	that is correct... sugarless chewing gum to cover it until you can get it repaired I just went thru this and that is what my dentist told me to do if it happens again.|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Your tongue moves most during the day.  So, chew up some gum and put a little bit over the sharp part during the day.  You can also try taking an emery board to smooth it a little until Monday
7BVyV4Fdaa	Pros: It's better looking, makes you feel cleaner... guys seem to like it...    Cons: Sometimes you'll get ingrown hairs, and it's annoying to do. You'll sometimes get itchy when it starts growing back...    Waxing is the best, it makes your hair grow in thinner.   I was like... 14 when I started... but that's only because I didn't know that having pubic hair was normal. . . .|`|rYg3SOFpaa	i dont think there are pros to it at all, its itchy and annoying to do. Waxing is the way to go!|`|HjZZGkZVaa	Well, I shave because its just my preference. But guys generally don't like hair. If you irritate the skin too much, you'll get red bumps, which itch and are annoying.  Use shaving cream, and shave downward, If you shave upward, you'll irritate your skin.  If you don't want to, its ok, its whatever you want.  Make sure you use good razors also.  Good Luck!|`|96RDuDofaa	I don't recommend shaving down there because it can cause sever razor bumps if you're not careful.....I prefer waxing!|`|CX9xijmtaa	wax it. guys hate hair except on the head.  wax the cooch to. thats nasty when hairy so wax it up|`|hA6JDWsFaa	I'm a late bloomer. I started about 3 weeks before I was 18 ( but it was always maintained clean! haha) I got it waxed. The waxing itself was horrendous but the outcome was great. I'm glad I did it. The only thing is that it does tend to itch and look pretty gross when it grows back.|`|jDGF4cjlaa	i shave it.  pros-its smooth the first day, cons-grows in reallllly fast    i was prob about 15 when i started.|`|RuebXJ1xaa	baha, I think its a good thing for women to do, not so much for men.    I started at 13 i think.|`|6jHDwy1uaa	i was 13 when i first did that.  and um, good thing about it is.. no hair there lol  & the bad thing, you can get red spots and it can get really bad.|`|7ilEjRxeaa	I started when I was 13    PROS: My boyfriend thinks it's sexy. Haha   It feels cleaner  It makes periods less nasty    CONS: Sometimes it's REEEEALLY hard to get perfectly smooth.  Ingrown hairs  Razor bumps  Takes a lot of time    :P It's sort of a burden  but it's worth it|`|7pYLhhCSaa	I shave it.  I started 2 when I was 13 and I am 14 now.    Pros:  It will look better in a bikini  You'll feel more comfortable  If you get pantsed in P.E or something the its bald and you son't have a bush  When your on your period it wont be as messy    Cons:  Razor Burns  Cuts((Hurt))  Ingrown hairs  Infections ((the hair is there to prevent infection))  The hair grows back thicker and darker every time  Take forever to shave.  Itchy    No I don't like to shave that area lol.  But I do idk y lol makes me feel more clean haha    hope I helped :DD  Good luck!|`|lRHoYNlUaa	i do shave that area because i think its nasty to have a bunch of hair stickin out of the sides of my undies!I was about 13-14 when i started shaving down there!Never shave with a single razor and always use shaving cream!U may get some bumps but they will go away!And the bad part is when it starts growing back it itches hecka bad!|`|KUxEBQuYaa	i do it and yes sometimes its itchy. but it beats fight all that hair.|`|ma3dPHZTaa	Itches like hell the next day sometimes. Its cleaner and boys like it. I was almost eleven when i started shaving there i mean had been shaving my pits and legs since i was like nine and a half just one more place to shave.
XHnpraaxaa	All diets are eat less and move more.  Walking is good exercise and has nothing to do to hurt your fingers.  Eat lean protein, veggies, and fruits.  Drink 8 glasses of water per day.

2oh6YX1Kaa	Usually our bodies and minds react to lack of sleep by feeling groggy, foggy and just a bit slow. This interferes with daily routines and diminishes the ability to function at your peak. It can also cause your mood to be less positive.    If sleeplessness becomes chronic, the consequences become more severe. Chronic loss of sleep over a period of time will seriously diminish ones ability to perform work on the job or at home. Sluggishness, forgetfulness, lack of concentration, slower reaction times and general malaise will begin to take over. This could result in accidents, injuries and even behavior problems. Your enjoyment of life will decrease and others enjoyment of you will decrease (because you will most likely be grouchy and lethargic). Without enough sleep, your body cannot repair and replenish itself, and your mind cannot take the time it needs from the constant bombardment of the outside world to perform the tasks that it must during sleep periods.|`|t9Nw86Plaa	You'll be tired and cranky/ irritable. You won't start hallucinating if you only miss 2 days of sleep.|`|8Ddb4OQfaa	YOU WILL SEE THING THAT ARE NOT THERE|`|SawySuLRaa	You would get very very tired.|`|3dccLgsyaa	You'll probably be nauseous, dizzy, and forgetful.|`|QcFZE8Bxaa	You would be awake for two days.|`|4ZGriYvGaa	tired, irritable, moody, lazy, u might feel a bit sick with a headache
JdVT7fW1aa	some dudes think queefing is hot lol, but maybe you're being a little too rough when you masturbate, it might be different when you're having normal sex. also try to relax when you're having sex, don't tighten up because it can cause your vagina to suck in air|`|4wFTXuOpaa	You have a talented vagina....try seeing if u could do a song out of farts something that will make ur boyfriend think, "damn my girlfriend is so cool,"
kjW1fmmPaa	Of course not all do, but I think quite a few want to be seen as "different" or "troubled", it also lends itself quite well to the whole emo scene - being a tortured soul with so many issues that no one understands.  It's almost appealing to be seen as the one who is crazy or troubled among lots of teenage groups.  Of course, some teenagers want to be popular and mature and would hate to be seen as troubled, they want to keep up appearances.  So we have to be careful to not generalize this and go with the availability heuristic.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think that they don't know what to do with their overwhelming emotions, and they think there must be something wrong with them to be feeling so strongly.  I think they are just worried, and don't want to talk to mom or dad, and yahoo answers is convenient.|`|mHOvddIvaa	From what I've seen at my school, most kids don't even fully understand Bipolar disorder. So I guess if they understood it they wouldn't wanna be.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	?????????? I didn't know they did. That is weird..... Are you bipolar?    Love,  Michelle|`|hDWaxGgDaa	I'm 16, and certainly don't want to be bipolar, but I don't have a choice as to whether I'm bipolar or not. I've had to be hospitalized 4 times because of it, and my parents force me to take medication.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	They are stupid.|`|WoqKWkQaaa	i don't think they want to be bipolar because they actually think they are it.  hormonal changes must be affecting their brain waves, it gets to their heads, and they can't get it out.  my guess is that because they think they are bipolar, they want the medication. not exactly sure why, but maybe they have the pressure of wanting to try drugs, or maybe they just want an "experience".  my next guess is that they want to be "special" because they're at the age where they would start to feel like a nobody, like they don't belong.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	There are teens that actually want that ? It's crazy if there are. For the people that really do have it. It is a terrible mental issue that causes havoc among families.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Who said teenagers want to be bipolar!?  I would hate to be bipolar..
6k5fhFyBaa	Everyone is different shapes and sizes hun. It's all in your weight and genetics. You've still got plenty of time to grow, and frankly probably already ahead of some girls.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I am a 36B and I'm 19. Enjoy it. lol|`|T1CuRwm3aa	You be fine|`|hA6JDWsFaa	sounds normal. if you want them to grow, drink milk. and lots of it. but i don't see why you'd worry about that now, you're 13. you should be having fun, not worrying about your breasts|`|CX9xijmtaa	DAMN you are hot in your pic,, and to tell you the truth most guys dont like them huge that is perfect size,  when they get bigger they get all deformed and nasty that is perfect!|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Average...your friends got big boobs~|`|RQc8fbjbaa	sounds average|`|ONQpHeycaa	They'll grow...you're only 13 for Christ's sake|`|maID21uJaa	I was a 36C when I was 13...  So you're normal.|`|7ilEjRxeaa	Sounds totally normal.  Especially if you're that thin|`|lRHoYNlUaa	if you are 32b at 13 you will get alot bigger as time moves on!plus your mom is not small you will probably fallow in her shoes|`|ODR21UgYaa	you are normal size and most women gain chest sizes with weight.|`|KfBk9UMraa	Yeah. Your fine, when I was 13 I was either a 34A or B. I am pretty sure A though. Your thin cause its mostly excess fat that gets stored.   They'll grow in time and for an example, you might be small now, but in HS be like a D or something. Hope I helped.|`|wTbEtc3Faa	You sound average.  That's a good thing.

It's okay, dont worry!!!          LOVEEEE,  ~Nikki|`|cX3yqEtVaa	You are 13.. some girls dont develope until after 18.  Don't worry about it.  Especially in high school.    And.. there are a LOT of guys out there that think it is sexy to be smaller anyways.. so who cares?|`|OmWamvEvaa	your fine hah. 32B for a 13 year old is actually pretty good. ah i was like a AAAAA hha jkk but your good. dont worry about it|`|c22a32bba4392e7e1e871d12549ff87daa	Quit worrying about the size of your chest and go outside and play...you're 13 years old for crying out loud.|`|JdVT7fW1aa	that's normal, possibly a little bigger than average|`|ddd5e90dc2f2dc38c72f539c860caa68aa	Your fine what ever size you are. every girl and women are different sizes and all are fine. There is no such thing as normal for this. Really don't worry about this on top of this your very thin for how tall you are.     Just a heads up you may get some pervs answering your question, you might want to be more careful about what you post|`|Yc0FBN52aa	It is a normal size maybe a little above a normal size but it isn't small it suits your body size.|`|AA10973140	32B is nice - better than 32AA or 32A.  When I went to school, the flat-chested girls talked bad about the ones who had bigger boobs.  They were jealous so they said that those girls probably let the boys play with their boobs to get them that big.  Funny huh?|`|KUZrSrrBaa	If my balls were breast, they'd be Double D's|`|X13XFZ3Laa	LUCKY BEEP! And you're only 13!  I'm 15 and I'm still just a 34A!

(Actually, I'll be 16 in April... damn time flies)|`|3d786176e9a854765c289939a34ee898aa	You are fine hunny. You are thin and young you boobs are the right size for your frame. I was flat as a board when I was your age. I didnt fully develop until I was over the age of 18!    And from personal experience..... you dont want big boobs.  They are quite the burden.  I have a 36 C and I have to wear large & xlarge shirts just to fit my boobs in them.   and I cant wear certain clothes/jacket also.  a lot of my friends have D's and DD's and they cause a lot of back and health problems.|`|7JwteIHmaa	i was with some guys after school one day and they have weird converstations they were talking about boob sizes and whats better all of them were like , if there a mouth full there perfect but if there bigger then that then whats the point.  so yah some guys prefer mouth fulls instead of huge *** boobs|`|7Z9vHytvaa	hey , i am 13 and 5'6 with 105 pounds and i am a 32B too i guess its average? haha|`|56qR0JQUaa	that's average for your age. I'm 21 and still a size 32c!! cant complain when i don't want to wear a bra though =) enjoy it|`|fhET9Awpaa	Sounds like you're good to go, but keep in mind that the chest area is mainly made up of fat (and some muscle), which is why people with larger fat mass tend to have larger chest regions.     You're larger than I was when I was 13...lol|`|nOos00dVaa	uhm your completely normal if not a little large for your age.  the girls with the c's probably where lose fitting or oversized bras which make them appear that large or just where c's and they dont fit well.
pUvEmPrCaa	It would definitely be a side effect of starting the pill.  The fact that you don't eat meat is just going to hurt you in the long run, but it's not going to make you feel the way you do now.    I would do some research on the common side effects of the pill you're taking and make sure that these are normal to feel or if you need to contact a doctor about them.|`|87e8184f643ec4cb00ae7615748f1da2aa	It might be your pill... it does fool your body into thinking it's pregnant. Also, consider what you've eaten. Is it heartburn?   The exhaustion thing could mean the possibility of a systemic infection, like from a bug bite or something. If you develop a fever, you should see a doctor.   Otherwise, I would call your gyno and tell the nurse your symptoms and see if they think you should try a different pill.
jOEkX7IPaa	i am in the same situation with my dad. and i also have type one and i am 15.  okay anyways i have not found a way to solve this problem and i have even tried to tell the doctors and they are not allowed to do anything. it makes me so mad.|`|jz07LXRTaa	who is that?|`|B4YESGmwaa	The sad truth is drug addiction does not limit itself to a specific age. Often times seniors find themselves addicted to medications that they originally started taking for the right reason, only over time started taking more and more. If your parents are not willing to address the issue, you are right, you are kind of out of luck. The only thing you could possibly do (risky of getting in trouble with parents) but you could call Grams doctor and let the doctor know your concern. Good luck and hang in there and realize that the tendency to be addictive is hereditary, and it could cause you a problem at some point, so don't start using alcohol or any drugs. God Bless Reggie|`|AosW4IvHaa	Wow.. I think if you take her in the room after she is not high.. Tell her you love her.. Ask her if she could please stop for your sake.|`|Q5RyzftZaa	I know this is hard for you to deal with and your family,   although a person who is addicted to drugs is usually in denial and can not see there is a problem. and a lot of times doctors will not do anything about it when it is an elderly person.  It is so sad all you can do is tell your gramma you worry about her and express your concern  to her. Maybe if you ask her how she would feel or what would she do if you were doing the same thing may open her eyes.  Also a lot of elderly people are addicted to drugs and pain killers because Dr's are just lazy and do not want to listen to the patient or see that is really happening. You could also speak to the doctor for her and express concerns to him or her.  Maybe you will find one that will listen to you.  God Bless you for caring and having concern for your Gramma
LDMV3WUTaa	Well, THANKS, for letting everybody know!!!  So that WE know to stay away from YOU !!!
ETcBRko3aa	Those other answers were screwy.      Bipolar Disorder is a genetic disorder.  So the fact that your girlfriend's mother is bipolar, increases her chance of having bipolar.   No-one knows the exact percentage, but the average age that Bipolar begins to "appear" is in the early to mid 20s.  If she has not shown signs of Bipolar by age 30, chances are she will develop it.|`|tMMxK65taa	it's not "shes going to be." she either is now or isn't. I don't exactly know the facts and figures but if she seems to go through periods of sadness and then really happy, almost like she is hyper, then yeah she might. But if she does, and she takes medication, it'll be ok|`|d19beXYeaa	She can't really become Bipolar, if you haven't noticed any unusual behavior from this point then she might not be. Sometime it strengthens more with old age, but of course there are pills one would  take if they had Bipolar Disorder. I don't think it's much to worry about, if she takes a lot of genes from her mother then she may, but from this point only time will tell, I assume.  Good luck to you!

qfSKgxDsaa	They will a little but you'll be okay until Monday.  They will have your old molds so they can make it out of that.  When you get a new one it'll feel tight b/c they will move a bit, but it's nothing to wory about.  I pop mine in like once every two or so weeks and they are tight but after like 10 or 15 minutes of having them in they feel normal not that "tight" feeling.  You'll be okay :)|`|zy5qcc0Raa	only a couple days. its not noticable at first, but after a while, you can start to tell.|`|4qhWiL8zaa	I never wore my retainer after I got my braces removed, they said they would start shifting within a couple days.... it's been 2 years and there's still no movement.

067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	When you exercise you put a demanding tole on your muscles, they are craving to replace there glycogen storage deposites (energy). To replace this you need to get quick absorbing sugar.   You can usually get it from bananas, canalope, watermellon, if not a fruits person chocolate milk is good. For every 1 gram of protein you need 3-4 grams of carbs.  Eat 2 bananas and drink the muscle milk pre mix drink and youll be good.|`|Y1TzyEGyaa	I used to drink muscle milk so here is my answer based on experience. It does help you gain muscle if drank right after workout but there are better ways. For one, Muscle Milk has alot of fat so if you drink after workout you beef up as well as add muscle. I now buy whey protein, and mix it with 1% milk and drink it after my workout, this for me has optimum results.
DIRbVD5uaa	For starters you can stop eating. But you probably dont want to do that.  You can use a Detox Diet. Good for rapid weight loss. But some of the weight can come back after ending.  You can try Slimfast or Special K, or you can Combain them together. But they will not work as fast.    I would suggest doing a Detox Diet for a Half a Week, then slowly adding foods and to lose more weight try slim fast.    Other options can include diet pills[[but those dont usually work]] or just not losing anyweight.    For a higher Metabolism if you still decide to eat is Fruit.   Alot of Vitamin C can act as a Laxitive if consumed in large amounts and you cant over dose on it either.

And instead of starving or fasting you should just start running. Its a lot healthier either way.|`|C1DsQsWlaa	You are a little below average weight for your height. Do you want to be anorexic??? Fasting is another word for starving yourself, which is not good. When you don't eat, your body wants more food, causing you to GAIN weight, instead of lose it. Also starving your self will help you to develop eating disorders such as Anorexia and Bulimia. You are just fine the way you are.

If you're going to try to be 100 thats kind of a little too skinny.|`|cGtw97maaa	my friend lost 17lbs in 14 days on a diet of only gummy bears and laxatives. but if your gonna do that, make sure to drink alot if water. and yes, fasts do work, especially water fasts, but stay hydrated|`|ZI5ZqFtiaa	Nursing student here,    When the body detects that your have stopped eating it will store your fat and keep your weight. And then when the body has to have energy from food that your deprive it of, it will burn the fat. By then, you'll be a year older and will be losing weight so fast that you'll have other issues.    Make sure you exercise!     A good diet...let's see...    anything. Only make sure you eat about 2000 Calories.  And then, make sure you burn those Calories by exercising.  (anything with the vitamins and minerals you need for other things too)    Okay let's take this step by step    Exercise and eat about 2000 Calories. This will make you lose your Calories which turns into fat.    losing Calories makes you lose pounds.    losing 3500 Calories will lose 1 lb.    burn it (exercise) before they accumulate lose your pounds.     that's it.  eat about 2000 Calories and exercise.     Happy birthday!

It'll give you a little bit more fat but won't show so that you're weight will increase but you won't start to look fatter or anything. It's healthier to be average weight or a little bit above because it fuels the rest of your body so I'd say to start eating a little bit more and some things high in carbohydrates of calories but not necessarily fat. I'm sure you're beautiful just the way you are but just to be safe, I'd suggest gaining a few pounds! |`|PV5f9PRIaa	I used to be like you, but even smaller than 5'3 .

In this case you are a little bit underwieght, but it's no bigee.   You might want to tone your muscles by doing arm and thigh workouts. You can find good ones on ondemand under sports and fitness. These aren't necessarily for gaining wieght, but they'll help prevent you from looking too skinny or "bone thin".  Also, don't pig out on junk food even if you don't gain wieght from it.

You are only 12 and BMI is only based on weight and height. I am 16, 5' 1 1/2"", and 134 pounds. The BMI chart says I'm overweight, but I'm not in actuality. You have alot more growing to do, and you're only smaller because of either genetics, metabolism, or both. My friend is 17, 5' 2" and only 92 pounds. She is healthy just like I am. Neither of us are into sports either.    Don't worry about it.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	Since you eat anything you want, you probably have a quick metabolism. In order to gain weight, I would start working out.|`|fWWYc2UZaa	make sure you're eating a good amount of food, maybe you just have a small appetite or something, but definitely try to eat a good amount. don't excercise more than you have to, but you should still excercise. get enough sleep, and don't worry about it too much. maybe try to eat a bit more fattier foods, like if you just eat salads all day, add some more fat into your diet. that's probably it. good luck!|`|fzg6YIKMaa	No if your eating fine and wat not its ok.|`|FyI9qlxBaa	it depends. maybe you are just naturally skinny. i wouldnt worry to much about gaining weight though. just try to incorporate a healthy lifestyle. cut back on junk foods and eat more fruits and veggies.  drink lots of water and excersise. trust me if you dont it will catch up to you in the future. when your metabolism slows down you will blow up like a balloon because of the junk you eat|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	94lbs for a 5'4'' 12 year old girl is fine.

Okay, so I get an excerise band, and adjusted it good enough to give resistance, but not too much or less.  Put around back and hold handles with arms.  Then go running and pull in the bands from nearly directly out to inward, keeping your arms stiff and flexing to give resistance.  The running keeps you pumped as well.  I generally would just run in place because it makes it a lot easier, and listened to music as my sets.  Whatever song, 'exercise' to it, then wait til next song, about a minute or so later it would be, and keep going.|`|uE8FyJijaa	pushups pushups pushups.

They'll be able to give you the best information about your menstrual cycle.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Lol. Yeah, it's normal. I had mine once and it didn't come back for months.  You have your mom's genes and your dad's genes so it's hard to tell if you will have a heavy period like your mom.    Just fyi for the future: you may have a very irregular period (this is also very normal), and it will take a few months to years to become more regular, and it's also normal if your period is always irregular (unless you get pregnant lol).

It doesn't get to be predictable for sometimes a year or two even.    You could end up being like your mom, but it could end up completely different. There is this weird like, hormone thing, and the theory is you might get your period around the same time as the other women/girls you hang out with or are around. So maybe you will end up having it closer to the same time of your friends...but yeah, genetically and everything, you COULD end up being like your mom...she might be a good indicator for you.    Hope that answers your question/helps :D|`|96RDuDofaa	Its perfectly normal--especially since it was only your first period. It could be a bit irregular for probably up to a year, so don't be worried.

I got mine when I was 13 and I'm 18 now and I sometimes miss a month or two here and there.    Be patient and don't stress about it.

BG8vMyZjaa	almost any problem in the mouth, from dental decay to ulcers to tonsillitis can increase the amount of saliva produced. Another big stimulus to saliva production is our brains. We only have to think about or smell food to get the juices flowing. Other psychological factors which affect our brain, from anxiety to excitement, can alter the flow of saliva.  Excessive saliva not necessarily a problem  However, increased saliva production is usually temporary and rarely causes difficulties. We make and swallow up to two litres of saliva every day, but barely notice its passing! Making more saliva doesn't make much difference unless there are problems swallowing it.

1D8tMCYIaa	I am not sure of the answer, but possibly the cave guide said this because some cave dwelling creatures never see the light of day and i.e. do not have any eyes. This, though is caused from years of evolution in which the creature pretty much throws away what it doesn't need.    As for a person being in complete darkness for too long causing blindness, I don't think so. Possibly the cells in the eye need stimuli to function, but more or less they become dormant until they receive stimuli once again.    Consider a person who has been in a coma for 10 years, I mean their eyes are shut (occasionally opened by doctors with flash lights), but when they wake, they still have their sight.      Very cool question by the way.|`|kVuhgvz5aa	This is a very thought provoking question!  I am almost positive you won't go blind, but am not completely sure.  Most likely your eyes will be very very sensitive to the smallest amount of light when you do come out of darkness.
eeRLckg5aa	Hopefully it's plain yogurt(all that sugar is no good for you)...sprinkle some whey protein over the top...I prefer berries with yogurt.    I usually just make a smoothie out of it....  1/2 c. frozen strawberries  1/2 c. plain yogurt  2 T. extra virgin coconut oil(boosts metabolism)  1 frozen banana  whey protein  Just be sure to get some protein and eliminate the sugar.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	That's fine, just make sure you don't go less than that and if you feel week eat some peanuts or something.

Good luck|`|MhowmBl9aa	It's healthy, but it sure wont give you the energy you need in the morning. I suggest you eat eggs with toast, anything high in protein.

And, in fact, doing that can be very healthy and beneficial to weight loss, particularly if coupled with some exercise.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	You can get braces without delay after a root canal.  I've never really heard of a dental insurance that won't cover extraction.  The price varies by region.  The extractions aren't a big deal to remove from a technical stand point.  While you are young, they'll be easier.  You usually only need advil for pain afterwards.
63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Peeling fingertips are usually caused by a fungal infection, but there is something else, it is called vasculitis, and if this is the case an antihistamine cream can solve your problem. But I would have your family doctor do a blood profile. You might lack vitamin B, or you might have too much vitamin A in your system. Strange how one vitamin helps the peeling heal, and one increases the peeling.. Usually this is on both hands.

(it just annoys the crap out of me and makes me want to sleep longer cuz they interupted my sleep)  you'll be ok though. if you are super tired after wards just go home and sleep it off.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Nope, there is nothing you can do.. You really just have to let it ware off and this can take from an hour to 5 hours.    It really depends on you and how long you were in surgery. You will feel very disoriented once you start to wake, and also you will go in and out of sleep, but after a while you will become less groggy.      Good luck with the surgery.|`|Osmyhvc7aa	No just relax.  You will be groggy for the rest of the day at least.|`|LJkPRqN0aa	there honestly isnt anything you can do to wake YOURSELF up. they put you under they bring you back. it doesnt matter minor or major the side effects are the same...trust me ive had 21 surgeries BOTH major and minor.. there is no way to wake yourself up
x8tkisD1aa	Sorry, but at 15 you really are too young to be trying something like this.  You likely haven't finished puberty yet (and this is not meant to be insulting, just a fact of life) and you may actually lose much of this naturally.  Consult your doctor about your concerns.  Be honest.  Diet and exercise are the best advice.  Your doctor should be involved in any supplemental intake.|`|S730dpLfaa	Matt, if you're serious,read this blog before taking any action  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...

If you want to build you do no more than 5 reps and use heaviest weight you can and still keep strict form. Do at least 3 sets.    If you want to lose or tone do 10 reps or more with less weight a weight that challenges you but is not heavy. If you do the sets back to back without rest this is called super setting if you super set you will raise your metabolism since this is an intense technique.    You can also do tri sets and giant sets tri sets are three sets back to back no rest and giant sets are 3 or more sets back to back this is intense training. I love doing giant sets then I finish my workout in half the time without all that waiting or resting between sets.    To burn fat on your stomach you need to work the whole body and the abs along with it.|`|qlL7BOHYaa	dude so much in common im 16 work on all that and wanna lose weight tho  and all my life ive heard that running is the best way to lose weight    oh and drink green tea there something in it that makes your metabolism faster i think?    and try free weights and possible join a sport (:  hoped i helped (:    answer my question on my page please (:|`|SgOVFseaaa	You can't choose where you will burn the fat.  For most men the stomach is the last place they will lose fat.     Weights will burn fat but if weightloss is your goal then you should also do cardio|`|AFi5kTiEaa	If you want to loose weight you need to do some type of cardio in addition to lifting weights.  Working out your abs will help you tone and build mussel, but if ther is fat covering it no one will notice.  If you run or do an eliptical, running would be best!  you will burn off the fat on your body which will give you the look you want.  Doing both is the most effective.  and a good diet.|`|Gpc9WHFyaa	Weight training can drastically multiply your weight loss efforts. Lifting weights builds muscle which in turn, burns more calories, helping you to lose weight and firm up. It is much easier to keep off the weight when you weight train because your body will burn more calories even at rest.

Our bodies naturally burn calories all day everyday just to maintain normal physiology (brain function, heart beating, breathing, etc).  However, exercising helps to increase the amount of energy (calories) being used or going out.  Now for the intake part, the biggest part is watching what you eat.  If you take in excessive amount of calories it will be stored in some form (carbohydrates/sugar, FAT, protein).  So, make sure there is more effort on using calories (activity/exercise) than taking in calories (eating).|`|9D8BX3Jtaa	Weight training is the only way to increase your metabolism permanently. More muscle, more calories burned while resting,hence faster metabolism and less fat.     Ab workouts don't burn fat on the stomach, but it will make them look better. To burn belly fat, aerobic exercise is the only way. Exchange fat with muscle but don't try to lose weight if you want to grow muscles. Very tough to impossible losing weight and gaining muscle mass.     At your age, focus on building more muscle (eat more protein and lift weights) and focus less on trying to lose weight. You wont mind gaining weight if the added weight is muscle.
d388f047075606c40d45e088cfac80bbaa	well first off i wouldn't recommend working out every day.  not only are you wearing down your muscles but your entire body is wearing down, including your immune system.  what i do is work chest, biceps, and abs on monday; back, triceps, abs on tuesday; wednesday i take off; same workout as monday on thursday; and legs, shoulders, abs on friday.  i take the weekend off so i can relax and let my body completely heal. make sure to work your legs otherwise you wont get the results you want in your upper body.  this is because more testosterone is released when you work your legs than just working your upper body.  as for taking a 5 minute break that may be a little long.  i usually take a 1-2 minute break.  also make sure to have a spotter if you are going to do free weights.  i try to stay in the rep range of 8-12.  this will help you gain strength and muscle mass.  10-15 will mostly just help with endurance.  also make sure to take in a lot of protein, or you would just be throwing away your work out.|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you 10reps that is plenty. When you work out with weights the muscles need 24 to 48 hours rest before you work them again. When muscles rest they develop and grow.     So you would need to alternate muscle groups if you are going to workout everyday. I usually do all muscle groups 2 days a week and the workout is 2 hours long. On the other days I exercise in the mornings for 30 minutes doing cardio and abs.    There are many ways to schedule your routine. Do whatever feels best for you and your goals. If you have particular muscles you want to target more than others then you work them harder.    BTW, you can work abs, calves, forearms everyday.  You can do cardio everyday.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	If you are going every day then you should dedicat certain days to certain areas of the body.  5 minutes is way to long to rest, i am not a body builder though.  I was told 45-60 seconds is what you should rest.  You should do 3 sets of 10-15 reps, resting a minute or so between sets.  If you waited 5 minutes between body parts you wouldnt have much time to lift weights.  Dont forget to do cardio, it is very important if you are looking to bulk up. It will burn off any fat you have on your body and give you a more toned body.|`|N4QPwScyaa	if u wana loose weight at home without dieting and exercising  by just changing your eating habits  u can refer to  http://medifastweightlose492.notlong.com    and u ll find so many tips for weight lose n medifast detox diets  try them n loose weight easily

DqZJ1KOgaa	Possibly the only good thing about this situation is that you are not alone. I had a friend who was in your situation, but as well as having multiple eating disorders, she was self-harming. Her family had been through a lot and for her, there seemed like no other way. At first it was less than what you are describing, she would skip a meal or two during the day, but remained healthy looking. But then it progressed, and progressed...when another good friend and I talked about it with her, she rejected our offer of taking her to see someone and refused to talk to us about it. After a while it was getting to be too much, her once athletic body was around 41 kilograms (and 178cm tall). So on her birthday, we said we were going to give her a huge surprise. We picked her up and blindfolded her, and managed to get her into a clinic. As cruel as we felt at the time, we knew it had to be done. When she took off the blindfold, there was a face I will never forget. She was so, so infuriated, and screamed at us both to the extent we were in tears. When she weighed in, the doctors said at the rate she was going, she would have been dead within the next 3 months. She tried to break out several times, but after months of treatment and rehabilitation she was looking much better. Now, 4 years on, basically back to her normal self, she says that had been the best birthday gift she had ever received.    Get yourself in early. It just spirals out of control and you have no idea what to do. Please, please get help. Not only are you harming yourself, but all those around you.|`|OtjXWzOZaa	Not eating is not going to help you one bit you should just start eating healthy and work out, once you put in the effort you'll see results its not going to be easy but if your that concerned it will be worth it.|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	Firstly you need to realize that your not fat, and by the sounds of it and my own experiences with people with anorexia, I don't think you are really fat, this is a weight chart so you can check for yourself (link below),  keep reassuring yourself that you are not really fat, and it's just a feeling you have, also not eating is not going to help you, because you need to eat, things like not eating or staring yourself at times will only harm you, look up websites and plan out a chart for yourself, read up about calories and nutritional value of food, so you know yourself what your body needs and what you can skip out on, hopefully that will help you maintain a regular diet and yet not make you feel like your making yourself fat, if none of these help, please go see a doctor or counselor, anorexia can grow into a very serious problem, good luck.    http://www.brianmac.co.uk/idealw.htm|`|FvB0hOIIaa	don't compare yourself to anyone, seriously ...  and if its guys you're worried about .. the right one will come along when your not even expecting it .. no need to change how you look for anyone|`|E2bagWkpaa	Sweetie, don't think you are fat. I know that sounds dumb, but first step is to think positive. I would highly recommend talking to someone you know. We, strangers here on Y!A, can only give you words. They can give you comfort. Talk to friends, family, or maybe a counselor? I was anorexic for over a year, and then balemic. I ended up in the hospital with no family and no friends in support. I know that sounds harsh, but it's true. That was a long time ago, yet, it affects me still. I would NEVER want anyone down that path because it was so incredibly hard to get out of it.    I suggest talking to someone. Someone who won't force you to start eating more right away. Someone who won't say omg, what's wrong with you? Someone you trust and know that all you need right now is to talk. After that, then you can seek help if you feel like you can't do it alone. Insurance covers many different types of "help" anywhere from just a counselor to a small group.     If that's not the road you are wanting to take, then sit down, by yourself, with a notebook and a pen. Analyze your life. Write down things that answer the question "Who am I?" and then skip a page and write down things that answer "Who I want to become?". On the page you skipped, make a list of things you can do to make those transitions. You do not need to be as thin as you think. Please believe me on that. I told myself I was "fat" so much, that even when I had a 16 inch waist. Which is BAD for  19 year old. You're in a mindset and it's really hard to get out of it if you let it go on for long.     I would suggest maybe signing up for a gym. I go to Bally Fitness and it's great! They work with me and show me which things I should focus on, they give me eating advice and such. It really boosts my confidence. I'm now average size and really happy with it.     I hope you can figure this out.   Best of luck!|`|FmKoukJbaa	I would first like to say that you are not alone.  I went through a bout of anorexia when I was younger and I know how disgusting it is to obsess about something like food that someone else would not think twice about.  Being past this, I look back with a different perspective but I do hope that what I say will benefit you...    You know that the condition you're in is not where you want to be, I'm sure you're miserable and hate the fact that you even put yourself through all this.  You mentioned a lot of things about other people, how others would perceive you, what they would think, etc...why? Has something happened to you in the past to put you in a situation where you'd be ashamed of who you are?  Why are you so sad about your life? I think it would be useful if you honestly searched your heart to find the truth. In my case, I was teased in high school which led me down a spiraling path of self-destruction, in more ways than one...maybe you should think about what brought you to this point and work out how to build a new foundation for your life. Only you have the power to change the way you think.  You should learn to love yourself regardless of outward appearances... I know it, it makes me want to roll my eyes too sometimes but as hard as it may seem in the shallow society we live in, try, just try.  Look around you, when you're on the bus or walking down the street, these are people with friends and family, going about their days..real people..living life! Remember how that felt...to just live and be free?  Time heals all wounds, but you have to take the first step.    My heart goes out to you and I wish you all the best.|`|mEgAbQVwaa	Wow I feel so sorry for you. I bet you are beautiful and very thin. Please don't think that you are fat. My waist is 42 and my chest is even bigger but I like who I am. I think you need some self confidence and a big hug!|`|koTI0lsMaa	Wow, you have a mixture of anorexia and bulimia, you are going to get sick quickly and possibly go into coma unless you go out to mcdonadles and order thier happy meal !|`|jOEkX7IPaa	anorexics don't know that they are anorexic until someone informs them also they want to be perfect in every way possible, so if your are neglecting to do your homework then you are most certainly not anorexic. so either you are lying or you have some other kind of eating disorder
In1UqryNaa	Yes, it seems when your younger you do it more. As you get older you may only sleep talk.  Or the sleepwaking may continue.  Sometimes people will eat or start getting dressed for the day.  Sometimes you remember bits and pieces of what you said or did, or think they just dreamed it.   My sister did it all the time, now she only sleeptalks.  Funny to watch people do sometimes.|`|x6lcRGvJaa	Only way to know for sure is to set up a hidden camera. I did that to my friend once and she was like ooooooh when she finally realized she WAS sleepwalking.|`|Azj1nMZVaa	If you are light sleeping then you are dreaming if you are sleeping heavily then you can sleepwalk once when i was in my bunk bed (was in heavy sleep) and woke up on the couch and i ask anyone if they put me there and they said no. and i read that light sleep is dream and heavy sleep is sleepwalk|`|AA11900730	mann i'd be scared if someone was sleep walking and just sat on my bed :S      of course you can sleepwalk while being half awake lol when i was younger i walked over to my dresser and started playing with my ear rings lol of course I don't remember.. my sis seen me lol|`|zy5qcc0Raa	maybe. usually you dont remmeber if you were sleep walking. you could have just been really, really tires, and not paying muc attention.

63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Friction and Fungus, can sometimes cause jock itch. When you wash your hair, do not let shampoo run down your body onto your genitals, it sometimes has perfume in it. Be sure and use a soap like dove.   Now my son got jock itch from wearing jockey shorts instead of boxers, boxers let your skin breathe.. His doctor told him to use a hair dryer on cool or mild to dry the genital area, istead of rubbing with a towel. Ask your druggest what to use for jock itch, there are several good products.|`|ZZPE83oqaa	too much pubic hair!|`|J9ErInzoaa	Have a ******* shower dirtball!|`|fk9AvB25aa	Genital herpes is usually passed on when you have oral sex or regular sex with some one that has genital herpes. If you have not had sex yet then I doubt that this is an std. It could be in grown hairs or possibly a yeast infection, men can get them too just not as commonly as women. If your worried then get it checked out.
yT3ZNEROaa	That is definitely a large bra size.  Is it too big for your frame I'm guessing probably so being so petite.  Its only an issue though if you are having trouble breathing, sever back pain, Bras ill-fitting and making sores around your breasts.  With the proper support and a big enough frame you should be okay. I would suggest going to a store that specializes in woman's undergarments and be properly fitted for your breast size.  Since your only 121 pounds it seem like forty is a large number for your frame and you are probably buying the wrong bra size.  You may be like a 36D instead and wearing the wrong size bra since you can't find a bigger bra from regular retail stores.  Hope this helps. -Lisa|`|XyhQpsvaaa	no!!! im a 30dd and im only 15   im 5'10 and weight 118|`|93db449e224fd5b8ea76301e8cf412a6aa	if that's what you need, no. everyone's different so it's fine.|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	yea, but not the cup size, the band size is too big|`|l69tjl0paa	If thats the size you need of course it's not too big!

It just depends on your body.|`|Yr1JsxSmaa	Nobody can tell you what is to big for you. However it may look unnatural because of your height. But forget those haters. But if you feel its a serious concern. The only person that can tell you is a doctor. I am your age soon to be 17 at 5'9 and 3/4, and my bra is about the same, so that's it. If it looks wrong check for your mother's opinion. ask about how big her sisters, and mother's were. Yes its awkward but its the only other way.|`|3d786176e9a854765c289939a34ee898aa	Why a 40C?

9EVcTnUWaa	No An Adult foster care is the same as child forster care with the exception of the age of the person being cared for. Adult forster care is uasually for adults who have developmental disabilies who are some what able to take care of themselves but need help with say cooking and doing laundry.  And other issues similar to those teenage children need.  Most of these people can care for themselves such as taking bath's and dressing. Eating by themselves and some times going to a day program so that they have something to do instead of sitting at home doing nothing. A group home is where there is more like ten to thirty adults living in a facility with doctors, nurses, theapist and other kind of help.  An Adult forster home usually only has at the most 3 or 4 adults with a care taker.

Its recommended that you wash your face with soap and water (or acne washes) only ONCE a day. You can still splash water on it in the morning, but don't actually wash it. Also, never scrub your face because that'll make you break out even more. I use neutrogena's wash and spot gell, it doesn't get rid of ALL my zits, but it keeps them to a minimum.

But for the 3 years before that, I was intensely suicidal for hours every day. It was just awful. I even tried ECT this past summer, I was so desperate. And it didn't work. But I luckily just got a lot better on my own for awhile now, and am enjoying that immensely.  I obviously still have depression, since I am still suicidal off and on, but much less than before.

It comes and goes. I will never act on it, though-- my Dad committed suicide a year ago and it was the most painful, traumatic thing my sister and I have ever experienced. When it happened, I made a pact with myself that I would no longer entertain thoughts of suicide because it is so painful for those you leave behind. I can't say I've been true to my word, but I will never act on it. I can't stress enough how terrible it is to deal with the suicide of a loved one. Even suicidal people who think no one loves them-- they're wrong. Everyone is loved in some way.|`|3dccLgsyaa	Yes, while going through withdrawal off of Klonopin.  It was the worst feeling.

MOQXdaZMaa	do u feel like ur loosing out of touch with reality|`|5gG2OfHIaa	O.K.,  I have experienced anxiety attacks for 40 years.   The symptoms you describe are exactly those I remember all those years ago.   I will tell you that the symptoms will not kill you.  My great wish in life is that a mental health specialist would have been straight  forward with you, as I am being to you.   My short and plain advice is to find a qualified medical expert to monitor you on a minor tranquillizer.  Personally, I would not engage in the time and expense of talk therapy.  It is not like you can forget about your feelings as they are with you most of the time.  My one regret and deep conviction is that talk therapists are frauds who only support your view of life and offer no real help for your symptoms.  By qualified medical expert,  I intend to advise that you find a responsible doctor who will not take you into the world of narcotics.  You can make it on a minor tranquillizer.  Valium is a 45 year old prescription medication that is safe and effective.  The medication will relax your muscles and give you material relief from the symptoms that you report in your question.  Finally, I know you are not exaggerating your symptoms. And I know you are no looking for sympathy; rather, some relief from the terrible symptoms you are having.  No,  your friends are wrong if they are saying "oh, shake it off."  I am guessing you are 18 to 22 years of age, the onset age for an anxiety disorder.  You have nothing that should make you ashamed.  After medication and the dumping of the talk therapist I was able to lead a somewhat normal life and professional succcess.  I just hope you get appropriate treatment sooner than I did.  Good luck.

Meeee tooo! i actually haven't worked, gone back to school or even driven my car! i know what ittts like!  and as far as anxiety, there are so many symptoms (as you know) that go along with it weather it be physical or mental, as far as why, there really isn't a short answer there, hey actually (to my knowledge) been able to pin point the exact cause of it and why it happens, many theories, many relate it to underlie the hippocampus part of your brain (memory), also, thoughts, thinking habits, irrational vs logical thoughts, you cannot die from anxiety disorders however panic attack i'm little unsure about.    many people are prescribed anti depressants as well to work with anxiety, (depression is also a common symptom of anxiety) also... benzo's yuck, but work.     wow!, anyway... what i try to do during intense anxiety,  steady my breathing,  listen to music / watch something funny  endure a good conversation with someone  just do what you can to get your mind of off it. stay positive.  don't get down on yourself either! the fear that you are having is real, even if it seems so ridiculous, ohhh also, try to exercise, it will release endorphins and serotonin which will help with your mood and helps with anxiety. (careful on caffeine, chocolate, things that can raise your blood pressure)
K4zsztkRaa	If your bladder hurts I would go to the doctor. But if you are only peeing because you are drinking a lot then that's not a problem.  But if at any time it burns when you pee or you get lower back pain get to a doctor right away because it can mean a kidney infection that could be life threatening.  Also look for symptoms such as rashes, fever, or vomiting.    -Connor|`|ZjfI0dSLaa	Since your 13, the best idea is to just swallow your pride and ask your parents.

In the mean time, drink lots of cranberry juice!!!!! they also make cranberry pills that are good to prevent these.

Toothpaste if way better than baking soda at helping your teeth.    You need to see a dentist so he can see what the problem is.  Many times it is a simple deficiency in a viatimin / mineral that can be easily corrected.  But, do this sooner than later or it can turn into an expensive, irreversible problem.
AA10299265	347 means, not only does he have it, it's pretty bad. Provided the measurement was accurate, that is. Normal should never go over 140... even if it's within a couple of hours after you slug down a 32 ounce Pepsi. There's a range between 140 and 200 that is considered borderline. Anything over 200 is definitely diabetic... regardless of what anyone else here is saying.|`|AA11434633	Without seeing how your husband tested his blood it would be difficult to ascertain whether that 347 is, in fact, a true reading.  There are many compounds which, when got onto the hands, can alter a blood glucose reading by a tremendous amount.    My advice would be to make sure that your husband washes his hands, dries them, and retests.  If it's still a high number, he needs to see his doctor ... and soon.  347 mg/dL is a high reading and, if done with clean hands, indicates that he is, in fact, diabetic.  The reason people are speaking of 2 or 3 tests is purely for the doctors satisfaction.  S/he would probably be going by WHO (World Health Organisation) advice which suggests that two or more results above 126 mg/dL would indicate diabetes.  It doesn't indicate whether that diabetes is type 1 or type 2.  Your husband's doctor would need further tests, and background information, for that to be diagnosed.    I'm pretty sure, too, that if that reading of 347 mg/dL is a true one that your husband's doctor will want testing done to ascertain whether or not your husband has ketones present.  (Ketones come about as the result of improper fat metabolism, which comes when the body is using fat and muscle tissue as it can't utilise the glucose that's present in the bloodsteam to make energy.  It's the body's way of preserving itself in times of 'hardship'.)    I wish both yourself and your husband the very best of luck in getting to the bottom of this.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	That number indicates that he has diabetes because it is above the normal which is around 90-100. He needs to cut out the bread and sweets.  He should have it checked and start dieting.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	He doesn't have to have diabetes just because his blood glucose was so high. He will need to get more tests done to come to that diagnosis, but a reading of 347 doesn't sound very good either.    Possibly, he might have hyperglycemia.    I think he should see a doctor asap.|`|lEQ4PhpLaa	Hi there just wanted to add my dads reading was over 666 yeah. He was in a diabetic coma in the hospital and is now on injections permanently. Do get anyone seen to that might have this.|`|iK3YYRaTaa	Definately has diabetes. Heres a little info.    What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels        There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes.     Fasting Blood Sugar Test:  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test.     Random Blood Glucose Test:  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes.     Oral glucose tolerance test  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus.     Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes.     Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have.     Notice the fasting test .Just one test with the symptoms and you can diagnose it as diabetes.    Take care and get that blood sugar level in normal range to avoid Blindness, Kidney problems , Heart problems and Neuropathy.|`|f35e4adb621395ef94ce87b7a970392baa	No.  You have to have...either two or three different types of glucose tests over the limit to be diagnosed with diabetes. He should check with his doctor to see what the doctor wants to do, and what other test he wants done (such as a 12 hour fasting glucose)|`|2PGvedOcaa	Oh my stars!  That is horrible.  What is his diet like?  Was this fasting?|`|9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	This is a very high number (normal 90-120). If you have a glucose tester you can test his early morning number for three days in a row. if the number is above 125 at say 6:00 am for three days and you have had high numbers two hours after eating your doctor will do an A1c test and a fasting glucose tolerance test. This is how they check for Type 2 diabetes and LADA (latent onset adult diabates type1). If your husband is super thirsty and peeing alot get him to a doctor ASAP as he could go into ketoacidosis (DKA) which is life threatening.     I am a Type 1 diabetic    Good luck!|`|ROPFKW2Jaa	He has all the symptoms and 347 blood sugar.  Yes he has diabetes.|`|yvHeor0kaa	Get your husband to the doctor immediately.  This is high and nothing to play around with.  I have Type 1 myself and felt lousy for a long time before I was finally diagnosed.  Once they diagnosed me, I started feeling much better with the first injection of insulin.  A good resource for information is www.mendosa.com    Good luck.
6k5fhFyBaa	You should never stop taking an anti-depressant--if you can't afford them contact the county/state for assistance. I would just start on what was prescribed, but perhaps contact a doctor to evaluate what you're taking. It's very important to follow dosages as they are perscribed, or you could experience adverse mood-related side effects.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I have been taking Zoloft for the past 2 weeks.  I am taking 50 mg per day.    It is very bad to miss an anti-depressant, especially Zoloft.  My advice to you is that, if you can't afford the drug, either don't start it or try buying the generic.  The generic name is Sertraline and it goes for half the price and is the same thing as Zoloft.  It's like buying a red t-shirt from Target and another one from Banana Republic.    You should start back from the lowest dose possible and talk to a doctor about getting a prescription plan.
TVNIxpVgaa	You have a chest cold, it sounds to me.  You may be run down so your cold seems more pronounced.  You need the rest and you need healthy foods..soups etc.   For sore throats you can take  Lactinex found at the pharmacy in their refrigerator, chewed up and let trickle down your throat will get rid of the bad bacteria and replaces your throat with good bacteria.  Take one - three times a day for your sore throat.    I wish you well.   Gwynn E.
X3EwBikVaa	I'm a swimmer too. A few things; practice your kick, bike riding and running up and down sets of stairs works for me.
6ocK56vzaa	What I do when I have a really bad cold is I go to the sink and blow my nose into it as hard as I can until nothing comes out anymore... It may be against your instincts to keep it in, but I find that it helps (it's not like you have an unlimited supply of snot in your nose!)|`|Azj1nMZVaa	Blow it ALOT.all the time|`|vdd5IX4iaa	Hi Danielle. I had a similar problem recently. The only thing that helped me was a sinus wash I bought over the counter. Basically, it comes with a squeeze bottle and some saline solution. You put warm water in the bottle and 1 to 3 saline packs, shake it up and clean your nasal passages by squeezing the solution in one nostril and letting it come out the other. It feels funny, but not bad and believe me, you will feel SO much better afterwards. Best thing I ever did!    Here is a link to the product I used      http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CP8...

PYHTML4Xaa	I did the same thing and apperently aids has to succesfully be transferred into your blood stream without contacting air in high enough levels to cause an infection. Because male on male sex is more likely to cause trama and bleeding it makes the risk greater, and the risk with needle use is obviouse. Not to say it cant happen. I still insisted and was negative. I think ur good but your mind wont rest until your tested. everytime you feel less than perfect you are going to think about it.|`|2y3rFvZIaa	Sounds more like stress than a symptom.  If you did not ejaculate I don't see where there is a high risk. Good Luck-|`|8VtNGFjAaa	Mucusy throat is from many things, sometimes from no apparent reason at all. If your concerned, have them do some tests to rule everything out.  It will give you a peace in mind when all said and done.
t9Nw86Plaa	No, it will not prevent your period.    Although, it's not a totally crazy claim; your friend may have mixed up 'prevent' with 'shorten'.

Your hormones determine when you get your period, and nothing else.|`|LKqbrHNnaa	Absolutely effing not.    Tell her that feeling an orgasm does not make the lining of tissue in your uterus magically disappear. An orgasm is just a sensation.

Never heard of such a thing actually|`|n6zqu8gKaa	no actually an orgasm right before your period will make it come faster. When you have an orgasm, your uterus contracts and squeezes. having sex durring your period may cause it to end sooner.|`|TWe7mNzaaa	no thats bs|`|3Sm1qQ1Taa	no it does not.

d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Anytime anyone has a severe personality change like you are describing than it is time to talk to his doctor. You say that he has lung cancer but than say he had radiation treatment to the brain . . this suggests that he has metastatic cancer that traveled to the brain. This does not sound good, perhaps the cancer has relapsed in the brain . . in any event a personality change is a signal . .it is not common at all . . so your mother or the primary caregiver needs to be discussing this issue with your fathers doctor.    My son had stage IV abdominal sarcoma for three years and never experienced this type of personality change . .so with your father it could be disease related or it could be medicine related . . call his doctor.|`|P544Sbmqaa	Well, you should most definatly make sure the doctor is aware of all this.    I was pretty hateful for a while during my second diagnosis.  I was ANGRY that it had come back and ruined my plans.  I had just started working again from the first time.  I was doing good with my work, I had a financial savings plan to help us find a better house to rent and to get me a newer used car that wasnt falling apart and some other things.  My hair had just gotten to a length I half way liked.  And then here comes cancer, all over again.  I mean, I was seriously soooo angry.  Still am to a point, that second time changed a lot about my life on a permnent level.  I did some things like that.  I wanted to do what I wanted to do and what I wanted to do only.  I ignored a lot of the neutropenic precautions because I resented needing them again.  And the more the people around me tried to force me to do the things I was supposed to be doing or wouldnt let me do things I wasnt supposed to do, the worse it made me.  Obviously, if he isnt capable of driving, dont let him.  But if you are fighting about going out in public or washing hands or whatever else...  dont.  Remember that he IS an adult and it IS his life.      I wonder if he is angry like that.  I mean, its common knowledge that lung cancer is still a really bad diagnosis if not terminal.  Would you not be angry if you suddenly found out your life was most certainly coming to an end, abruptly?  You could try to encourage him to see a psychologist, but in this state of anger, he probably wont.    Although, as mentioned above, you said he had radiation to the brain.  If he has any of the cancer in his brain, that could explain a lot of his attitude and behavior, and for that reason, you need to make sure his docs are aware.    If he is confusing reality with dreams, that could either be cancer in the brain, or maybe the narcotics.  I have very vivid dreams anyways, and when I am taking that amount of narcotics, it sometimes gets a lil fuzzy the difference between the two as well.  Whatever the reason, this may be why he refuses to sleep even when he is tired.      You should also find out if anything about his meds is steroidal.  The add steroids to the chemo cocktail all the time today.  Its in an effort to combat weight loss during chemo, but depending on the dose he is getting, that could be a source or this behavior.|`|QqY8YgGDaa	Both!My father had no cancer .still showed many of your fathers behaviour.You can be prepared for his behaviour.  When my father was behaving angrily with all in my house,he didnot angry with me -I talked to make him instantly happy,then he will not have anger.More over if you do like that he will remember it and when ever he sees you he will stop anger that is mainly becuse every one likes calmness not quarrel.I didnot argue with my father that what he saw was dream,I also accepted it as real.Washing hand is called OCD many have it.Change his environment ,we did and stopped his anger.Priviously my father used to quarrel with my mother all night ,for him it is like day, then we used several  tricks to calm him  I will not accept that your father has become mean.. If your father who is aged and ill ,naturally with less self confidence and less strength to fight for life can be called as mean ,what we word we can use to call ourselves, is it not that your and mine behavior can also be called as more mean ,because we have more strength ,youthfulness, strength .Are we behaving such a great non mean life? My father also showed similar behavior and my brother and mother felt he has become mean. But I do not except .But whenever I entered his room his behavior used to change.  -Since now you know what are his behavior, you  can change all the objects in his room to soft material, change seating arrangements in room so that he cannot access children when he becomes angry. More over ,Doctors can wrap him with  false bandages which are really not necessary for him ,but the bandages can be tied in such a way as he cannot do  fast ,violent motions with his hands. But doctor will not know this type of wrapping ,so you have to consult a police  sub inspector  and learn how they prevent  thiefs  from violent moves & escapes .Do that for your father in the name of medical bandages.  -Since he has been given radiation ,some other  parts of brain might have also effected. Therefore do not think any of his character as bad. It is only medicine al effect .After few days he will be all right. Explain  this thing to all your family members ,so that they will  not feel bad about him ,less educated people do not know these hormone .chemical effect on brain and behavior  You can write e mail messages to me through this section,by clicking on my profile|`|WkLJI40baa	It is both.

The recognition and understanding of mental disorders has changed over time and across cultures. Definitions, assessments, and classifications of mental disorders can vary, but guideline criteria listed in the ICD, DSM and other manuals are widely accepted by mental health professionals. Categories of diagnoses in these schemes may include dissociative disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, eating disorders, developmental disorders, personality disorders, and many other categories. In many cases there is no single accepted or consistent cause of mental disorders, although they are often explained in terms of a diathesis-stress model and biopsychosocial model. Mental disorders have been found to be common, with over a third of people in most countries reporting sufficient criteria at some point in their life. Services for mental disorders may be based in hospitals or in the community. Mental health professionals diagnose individuals using different methodologies, often relying on case history and interview. Psychotherapy and psychiatric medication are two major treatment options, as well as supportive interventions and self-help. Treatment may be involuntary where legislation allows. Several movements campaign for changes to services and attitudes, including the Consumer/Survivor Movement. There are widespread problems with stigma and discrimination.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	if youre healthy minded, its easy for you to write off people who complain of mental disorders as "attention-seeking" or "bored", but they are in fact very REAL diseases. why would someone choose to be in a constant state of mental turmoil??  however, there are people that dont have ANYTHING and just fake symptoms to justify actions.    dont judge, just thank your lucky stars that youre fine and have a balanced brain.|`|451075cc0b28ffa413b31fd0b3fd84c0aa	Duh.  Any label is a categorization or classification for convenience.  Language is for convenience.  It is widely accepted that certain diseases (at least certain clusters of symptoms) are specific to certain cultures and persons having similar mental processing (or processing deficits) would not be diagnosed as being ill in other cultures.  Any behaviour (or mental processing) which demonstrates deviation from the norm may be considered an illness.  This presupposes that a human is a blank slate capable of infinite adaptation none of which is genetically determined.  As we learn about the limits of human adaptation and the genetic aspect to the capability to adapt, we are better able to teach the marginally dysfunctional to better function.  My definition of an alcoholic is anyone whose drinking affects other parts of their life.  Similarly, one could argue that any mental processing which adversely affects a person's life is an "illness".  If it causes suffering, are you arguing it shouldn't be addressed if it is "outrageous"?  No?  Then what IS your point?  That it should be labeled something other than an illness?  If so, you may be unnaturally fixiated on words as existing and having extrinsic value - Is that OCD or just neurotic?|`|AA10824931	Everyone is mentally ill, it's just the degrees that makes a difference.

I like to use Vicks 44, but, find that if you like being 'knocked out' that Nyquil is good too (what I used to always take).  But, if you go to the doctor, and s/he says you have just a cold, they will probably instruct you to purchase Robitusin (i'm sure thats spelled wrong), as, the last time I had a common cold, and went to the doctor, this is what I was told to buy.    Hope to be some help.|`|pUvEmPrCaa	I'm pretty sure this means you are sick.  It sounds like a normal cold.  It could be seasonal allergies depending on where you live.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.    When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the  1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern.     If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.    You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.    You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

OrFYRg27aa	Depression is a serious mental illness and you're mom probably really cares about you so I think you should just say, "Mom, I think I suffer from depression and I feel terrible a lot of the time. I need help." She'll appreciate the fact that you're responsible to admit you've been having a problem and be relieved that you said something before doing something terrible to hurt yourself. Ask you're doctor about maybe going on depression pills or maybe seeing a psychiatrist. It was so responsible of you to admit you have a problem in the first place. You sound like a great girl! Hang on and remember that even when you're frowning, there's someone out there who's thinking of you and smiling! |`|vjdAoFPvaa	well, I've gone through the same thing but it started at 14, and is still progressing two years later, depression is not something you just get over. Telling your parents is a huge step, and you have to make sure that's what you want.     On hand they, you can tell them you haven't been feeling like your self and you think you need to get some professional help, I wouldn't tell them about the cutting or the thoughts of suicide, Only because when my mom found out she flipped, and almost sent me away. I'm not going to say don't cut, that's one thing that helps me the most. But its not for everyone. If you don't want to become a full time cutter you need to stop now. It is extremely addictive, just like drugs. after you do it so many time you don't even think about what you are doing to yourself. If you decide to continue cutting just be careful about it. Your upper thighs are a good place to do it, their are no major veins, and its easy to hide.   I hope I helped/can help some more. I am very open to talking about depression and cutting so if you feel the need i.m. or email me.|`|eTwTcw1Waa	You go "Mom, I am depressed and I need some help.  ".

Look for hotlines at your school, or go to the nurse and ask her if she has any info regarding depression. Google online for support in your area.   I suppose that depressionn is something that many many people struggle with.  You are far from alone with this. Don't be ashamed, some people are be more than willing to help you out cause they're recognize it is a serious problem that needs treatment and counseling.|`|WHFzKlJCaa	I understand how hard it is to tell your parents about the things you feel, hurting yourself, wanting to kill yourself, how miserable you are and it does make them sad but only because they love you and are worried. I think a therapist or psychiatrist would be good. You can even go to your regular doctor, tell them what you're going through and they could refer you. BUT don't let your everyday doctor give you the antidepressants. They are not specialists and I've heard a lot of horror stories.  Writing a letter/email is often easier than telling someone face to face.  If you need/want to talk you can email me at mrs_sage@sbcglobal.net .  I'm always happy to help. I've been there.
LKqbrHNnaa	Try one of the thrush creams at the chemist/supermarket. They are aimed at women since it's more common for them, but you can still use the cream the same way just by applying it to all affected areas of the penis.  Unfortunately if the thrush is internal for you (burning, irritating sensation where your urine comes out), obviously you can't squeeze the cream inside.  This is when going to the doctors is a good idea so he/she can give you something you can take orally as well as cream.    Good luck!|`|RUf73hG1aa	Go to Wal Mart and get some Monistat cream for it.

If it is in fact a Yeast infection, then your GYN can prescribe a pill that is taken only once and within 24 hrs you start to feel better. The med is called DIFLUCAN and it will cure your infection.  The best part is you only need one dose.   If you want to relieve the itch some over the counter vagasil can help.  If you have never had a yeast infection you better go to the doctor for a proper diagnosis.  You don't want to let an STD go undected because it will be worse later.  I hope this helps you out.
VNvVhDWgaa	Saturated fats are BAD fats. You want unsaturated fats. One thing to cut out is red meat. Once in a while is ok, but you're having cholesterol problems at that young of an age, red meat should go off the menu. Substitute red meat for chicken and fish (not tuna) and go crazy on vegetables.    Avoid fried or greasy food as much as possible! When you do need to fry something, have it fried in olive oil, because that is the best oil for your body. It has a much smaller amount of saturated fat and much higher levels of non-saturated fat. It also, if i remember right, has some of the Omega-3 fatty acids that we all need a lot of, as does salmon and some other types of fish.    The best recommendation i can give you is READ labels. And try to bake, rather than fry your foods. If i cook meat on the stovetop, instead of using oil, i use water and cooking wine, with a lot of herbs to help increase the flavor. It really works wonders and it helps drop your cholesterol much faster, especially if you're cooking chicken or fish, rather than store bought red meat.    Another thing you can look into is game meats. Deer, squirrel, rabbit - they have more protein and less fat than the beef you buy at the store. It is more expensive to buy, but the meat not only tastes better, but is much higher quality, because they aren't being injected with all kinds of steroids and other garbage than what cattle are.    Also, think about what you order at restaurants. Once in a while having something fried and smothered in cheese isn't going to hurt you, but doing it regularly is. Another tip that i give people, is stop drinking cow milk. Go for soy. If you don't like the taste of the regular soy, go to vanilla soy, it is healthier and better for you than cow's milk, which contains a LOT of fat.    Oatmeal is really good at helping lower your cholesterol. For a sweetener for oatmeal, try brown sugar instead of white or honey (also very good for you), maybe a little cinnamon, and a splash of vanilla soymilk. Also eating foods high in fiber seem to help. Mini wheats are one of my favorites. There's also rasin bran, bran flakes, and other cereals that are high in fiber and lower on the sugar scale that will help bring your cholesterol down. Watch out for starchy vegetables like potatoes, corn, hominy, and similar. A little bit is ok, a lot is not. Salad with low-fat dressing (be picky) is a great filler and can also help keep your cholesterol down.    It's a change in lifestyle to keep your cholesterol down, but it's worth it, because if your bad cholesterol gets too high, you're at serious risk for other health problems, especially the heart.    As far as the good cholesterol being too high? Here's what i found on a site:    HDL cholesterol is known as "good" cholesterol. HDL removes excess cholesterol from the arteries and back to the liver, where it is passed from the body. HDL carries cholesterol from the arteries to the liver, which gets rid of it. Having high HDL cholesterol improves your heart health. If your HDL is low, your doctor will try to raise it. With HDL, the higher, the better.    Cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter of blood, or mg/dL. So an HDL cholesterol level of "40" is 40 mg/dL.    HDL cholesterol should be higher than 40 if you are a man, and higher than 50 if you are a woman.1 When your HDL cholesterol level rises over 60, it actually starts to counteract other risk factorspushing your risk further down.    http://www.niaspan.com/Understanding_Cho...|`|YL5ziuTRaa	Tell your BFs mom that your cholestorel is high and tell her to cook more healthier foods like grill the food, use a oil with low saturated fats and no trans fat.    1 or 2 grams of soluble fiber lower the bad cholesterol by atleast 1%. An apple has atleast 1.2 grams of soluble fiber.    Lower your saturated fat and trans fat intake. Eat more low fat foods.    Mono unsaturated fats lower your cholesterol too.    Good luck!|`|mC2PXK4Faa	it could be genetics.  try and cut down on your bread and dairy intake.|`|GqdEfuo8aa	You're not the first to think that being skinny means you don't have high cholesterol! Since you're young, I think changing your diet will do the trick. So first of all, eating OATMEAL is an awesome way to get rid of cholesterol. Oatmeal has soluble fiber which when mixed with water forms this gooey substance in your body that attaches to cholesterol and takes it out of the body with it! Also, don't eat, or cut back on eating egg yolks. Egg whites are fine, but the yolks have a lot of cholesterol. Also try to stay away from red meats, and full fat cheeses. And it's a good idea to stay away from fried foods in general.  Saturated fats are going to be found in fried foods and red meats, along with candy and cookies... check out your food labels! Good cholesterol is important, but you can always have too much of a good thing!   Good luck!!!
QsD9VOMYaa	discharge is normal, you may notice it more when you go to pee because your pushing down on your pelvic muscles which then helps to push out the discharge.   You may get your period anytime soon (now- 2yrs).   Discharge cleans out the vagina (which is why you dont need to clean the vagina, because it already does it for you, clever lol)    what your experiencing is TOTALLY NORMAL|`|96RDuDofaa	Yeah ur either getting ur period or ur body is just cleaning itself.|`|GJCUCVSMaa	you usually discharge alot before your period but i have NEVER had discharge drip out of me...i mean maybe everyone is different but I have never heard of this..you might want to ask a doctor..|`|ymybcLoeaa	I'm 13 and like i would always get the same thing when i was like 10 and 11 but i didn't start my period until i was 12.....i'm not sure why, i guess some girls just have more stuff than others....everyone is different|`|lRHoYNlUaa	yes that is normal it comes with being a young lady!|`|Z0Gr5ongaa	i have the exact same thing as u. i have had discharge for like 2 years before i had my period but everyone is dirffrent. my discharge is so bad when i walk around i feel it dripping out. try always pantliners. they come in a purple pack. theyre really good for discharge. hope it helped.|`|q7Cirghpaa	umm thats a hard one yes if you have had it for about a year then yes when it starts to go brown then you will get it BUT if you just want to start it hears what to do.

Also a tongue ring feels great incase thats an option|`|QBUypAmAaa	I answered this earlier in the week, but unfortunately that question has been deleted since then.   It's not all about fitting it all into the mouth. A lot of techniques that heighten the pleasure involve what you do with the penis outside of your mouth. Hand action is always a plus when not in the mouth, licking the testicles is highly sensual to lots of men tracing your tongue around each testicle and sucking on them slightly too. Licking up and down the shaft slowly under and over and to the sides is really hot. While doing this, if your man is comfortable with it, cupping the testicles in your hand and gently rolling them back and forth in your hand is a good idea. On the head licking the bulb part where it meets the shaft on the underside is very pleasurable, then licking right underneath the ridges of the glans are very much so as well. On the glans itself lick it like a lollipop and slide the tongue in the crease of the slit, that's almost orgasm inducing itself. If he is intact/uncircumcised, blowing on the head of the penis can be really sensual due to its sensitivity and licking the frenulum as well is wonderful.      When you put it in the mouth swirl the tongue around the glans and sliding along the slit some more, use a lot of hand action when focusing on the glans so the rest of the penis feels sensations all over. Slowly work your way down the whole shaft (if you can fit all of it in, if not use the hand on the rest), then work your way back up flicking the tongue and swirling it and slowly gliding it along the shaft. All in all beware of teeth, make sure your mouth is large and wide open when giving a bj, but the lips must be tightly enclosed around the shaft of the penis, curving the lips inward is a good way to insure that he won't feel your teeth, as that really makes a man uncomfortable and doesn't feel good at all. Don't worry much about saliva, you'll probably produce enough, and besides he'll produce pre-ejaculate too which will help with the process some, when that happens actually, it's good to take the penis out of your mouth, put a finger on the pre-ejaculate and pull outward so it forms a beady string, then lick it up sensually like a sweet candy, he'll like that a lot, it means your really giving your all to please him. Occasionally take the penis out of your mouth and restart the process out of the mouth to back in the mouth.     As for the load itself, depends on what he likes and you as well. If he likes you to swallow it, just go with it, if it's a thick and large load swallow a little at a time. Even if you don't like the taste so much, it's not bad to do for your boyfriend, because it only lasts a second. If it's an absolutely repulsive taste then just let him ejaculate onto you, such as on your breasts if they're exposed or face (close your eyes), or body if all of you is naked, or for even more fun, have him lie down and ejaculate all over himself, and you lick it up and lick him clean.     Most important tip: eye contact, makes it not only sensual but sentimental as well. Well that's it, I can guarantee your boyfriend will love you forever if you employ these techniques lol.|`|d09432d5f16b0b606f445596be973266aa	Milk his prostrate with your middle finger.

isA4wtnMaa	I think any time is a good time.  I eat it as a snack or as dessert because it's light and has calcium and protein, which is something I find hard to get.      If  you're wondering which food are best to eat when here's just a few tips that I've accumulated over life from researched studies or dietitians.      Eat a small amount of protein before a large/main meal to start your digestive system.  This helps prevent over eating.     Eat vegetables instead of fruit at night because they have less carbs.  Consuming carbs within 2-3 hours of going to bed will allow them to turn into fat.  This isn't to say that you can't eat fruit at night, but vegetables are preferred.  Fruit would be preferred over bread.     Eat more during the day rather than at night.  This allows you to get more use out of the calories you consume.     Carbs are good before a workout and protein is good after.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	Yogurt consumption depends upon many things. If it is an "active culture" yogurt, it will aid in the digestive process. It works best just after a meal. This helps best in the digestive process. It can be a meal in itself.  All non-active culture yogurts are merely a food and therefore, how much and when you eat it is immaterial (does not matter.)  It is important to know what your objective is, to properly answer your question.  I hope that this helps.|`|f41e958b0c31e9f64f0f73d1d41bea7faa	its spelled yogurt.  results for what? be more specific
ZtECjEPyaa	yes, its true that they mess up your eyes. contacts aren't for being fashionable, they're for people who really need them to improve their eye vision. YOU DON'T NEED THEM.|`|bdcMTRuNaa	it will mess up your eyes  and asian girls especially look terrible with colored contacts.
q9i5f0rXaa	Tough to say, but probably around 5-7 or so would be my guess.  Realize, though, that a lot of it wouldn't be fat.  Most would be water, muscle, etc.  So although you will have lost weight, you probably wouldn't look any better.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Back in the day, when I was younger.. I used to fast for 9 days and eat for 9 days.  It was a cycle thing. In the 9 days fasting, I would lose about 4-6 lbs.|`|cei3Xnn3aa	you'll die to death|`|vjM9ejGjaa	It is impossible to determine how many pounds you will lose by starving yourself for a week, however if you do decide to do this your body will go into starvation mode. Then, next week when you start eating again it will want to store all of the calories that you consume as fat just in case it has to starve again, so you may end up gaining more weight than you lose.    Suggestion: keep eating but change your diet. Try to get your five servings of fruits and vegetables in every day as well as the eight servings of water. Only eat 100% whole wheat bread products (and make sure it says 100%, if it doesn't specifically say it, it's not) and try to cut out dairy products. Keep eating meat, try for high in protein and low in fat. If you want even more drastic results, start adding more exercise to your life, a good mix of cardio and strength will show results.|`|tPm0qb31aa	you will lose pounds that are all muscle.  This is because your body is storing your FAT  because it is going into starvation mode.  Once you lose that muscle you will eventually gain all the weight back and the fat will be harder to lose than ever! This is personal experince!
atmDaT61aa	I was the same way when I was that age I ate very little, exercised all the time, took diet pills, purged when I could, and even took laxatives. I was at the point where I gave up all my friends so that I could live like this without any questions. I am a thin person but as soon as someone even hinted that I gained some weight which unfortunately especially in jr high and high school jealous girls are more than ready to say to you to make themselves feel better (only now do I realize this) I would feel horrible and ashamed. Then when I realized I didn't go anywhere and didn't talk to anyone anymore I stopped caring and started eating whatever I could when no one was around and would just wear over sized clothes so no one would notice not that I really gained all that much weight anyways but I didn't realize it at the time.   It wasn't until after high school that I realized how bad this was for my health and how much I missed having friends and going out that I stopped doing this, started to live healthy, and started listening to the compliments people would give and believing them.   I know that anorexia and bulimia seem like quick fixes but they are very bad for your health in the long run do research on the web and you can see just how bad it is that's what I did and I realized I wanted to live a long and happy life not just be thin in high school and have horrible medical conditions later on.  I was able to break the cycle without professional help but not everyone can and in no way is it a bad reflection on yourself to seek help. If this is something you can't control and fix yourself then do get help being thin is not worth the price of your life.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Yes you have issues and should talk to someone about them before they become obsessive.|`|tRE05DNTaa	instead of not eating EAT! Your going to regret that later, once you stop eating and you have been anorexic for a while your metabolilsm stops and u will GAIN weight!  So in the morning eat a healthy cerial like Special K with skim milk and at lunch eat and apple (any sort of fruit) a turkey sandwich on wheat and a granola bar, and something for dinner thats semi healthy. And after school you can go run or join a gym. You will loose weight faster and healthier this way than ruining  your life later.    I know because my mother almost died of anorexia!|`|0xWAHvKYaa	There is nothing wrong with you...I went through the same thing in high school.  I never ate breakfast, skipped lunch and had something very small, like a sandwich or bowl of cereal for lunch.  I lost a lot of weight, and loved it...but I also loved playing high school volleyball with the team but I never had energy for practice and came so close so many times to fainting because I was running around on an empty stomach.  Because of this my coaches I guess thought that I was lazy or just a weak player so I was benched for many of our games when the truth was I was a very strong player...but I just made myself weak by not eating.    I became anemic...still are today( I'm now 21) for hurting my body back in high school....and I still battle with my weight today but I force it into my head that not eating is so bad for me and can even kill me.  When you don't eat much and purge all the time, your body gets no nutrition, your muscles weaken and your heart is a muscle....a heart which pumps us full of life in the first place.  So instead of starving myself I eat nothing but greens, fruit, and protein loaded foods in right sized portions.    I could easily starve myself again, but I want to live...and I don't want to make my body develop any other permanent health problems by not eating.    So just know nothing is wrong with you...unfortunately we develop issues within ourselves in high school due to image and people judging you.  Just try your hardest to keep your head up and not hurt your body|`|EnmnHwhWaa	Well, first of all, there is something wrong with everybody...but fortunately for you it can be fixed, you just have to find someone you can trust, like a parent, or an aunt and really talk to them about it. And you don't need to worry about being a 14 year old girl weighing 105. Plus, you could join a high school sport, like softball, swimming or track, some of the coaches keep pretty close tabs on what their players eat, so he/she could help motivate you to get and stay healthy! GOOD LUCK!|`|Sc6oGITNaa	Yes, there is something wrong. But I mean dont listen to that girl that said your bigger. I personally think you have a good weight and dont feel bad about eating some snacks or fat.    You should really talk to your parents or someone you trust about this. You can get some help. Your prob. thinking that you dont need help,but you will feel so much better once you let all of what you have inside.     Its fine that you don't eat at school,because a lot of kids at my school don't eat that lunch. But you can always get a salad or something that is healthy and full with fat or a BUNCH of calories.    You can watch your weight,but don't go overboard. If you still purge please stop.Ive heard that if you purge you can actaully gain more weight. Im not sure if this is true though.    Anyways,I hope this helped in some way!|`|snmJhp9Naa	okay.....there is something wrong with you.    If you weigh less than 105 lbs, then you better start eating more.  Its fine that you are exercising, but the thing is that you eat junk food and that is not good. You should start eating healthy food like fruit, vegetables, dairy products, meat, etc. You should also start eating your 3 or more meals a day because your stomach will shrink. The stomach is a muscle and a muscle needs to exercise. You try eating when you feel hungry, even when you feel a little hungry. If you leave your stomach empty just for getting skinny, don't do it! There is a  liquid from your body that goes to your stomach to digest your food. If there is no food, that liquid will make little caves or something to your stomach that it will hurt so much. Believe me, I used to be you. Right now, Im 14 going on 15, 120lbs, 5"3, skinny, and healthy.     Don't go on being anorexic because when you get use to it, it will be hard for you to get out of it. Being anorexic is not fun and does not make you beautiful. Yes, you will get skinny but way too skinny. Your cheek bones will show more, your lips will look big and longer than before, your bones will show, your clothes will look saggy (even your swimsuit) and you will look sick and weak. Death can also occur.  Even, why do you want to be more skinny? To show off? To get a guy, cause guys prefer girls that has some meat in them.    Go get skinny if you want. Less than 90 lbs, you'll regret it. 105 lbs is fine, even 110 lbs. But if you want to be anorexic, then be my guest. You have the option to choose life or death.
B12E4rYiaa	You must watch your calories by having a calorie chart and using it. Log your food and drinks everything. Be consistent and don't give in to junk food but eat healthy snacks that are low cal and low fat.    Exercise at least 3-5 days a week preferably cardio and weight training a good combination of intensity and strength. So that when you lose you will be toned and not flabby.|`|Z2VhiIBAaa	exercise! eat delicious healthy foods like chef salad with italian dressing. if u like fun exercising try the wii fit. eat healthy foods like whole grain pasta. try organic foods.... hope this helps, oh and hit the gym|`|Apzt6EeTaa	Simply exercising more and eating less junk food works for most people.

NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.    Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.    First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.    However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at theweig htlossplace.com along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.    Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|DIRbVD5uaa	Im going to have to say Hydroxycut  Alli didnt help for me or anyone else i know|`|xmofjgNaaa	i wouldnt diet and exercise is enough. on tv, they cover every disease in the side effects. personally, i would rather be fat, then die, but that's just me.

BNAzjSO1aa	I think if neither of you has had unprotected sex then it is unlikely to be an STI's It may be that when you had sex for the first time when it hurt that she was not quite lubricated enough, maybe this happened a few times and now when you attempt sex your girlfriend now tenses up and is scared that it will hurt so it does and so the cycle continues. Does it hurt if you are fingering her in that area? If it does not then I suggest that you try an evening(period of time) where you are intimate with each other , but with no penetrative sex allowed. Touch and caress each other indulge with mutal masterbation if you want give each other a massage naked. Basicaly do everything that feels good but with no sex, I would try this for a few times and see where it leads but let your girlfriend decide when penetrative sex is tried again. When she is ready make sure she is extremely well lubricated and try to keep it at a gentle pace at first. It might be an idea to get her checked by a doctor but as there was no problem at first I am not sure that there will be anything a doctor can do. Remember the biggest sex organ is the brain so maybe discuss sexual fantasy's but let your gf take the lead. Most of all be caring and supportive like it seems you are being. Good luck I hope this helps and that you get it sorted out. In the UK there is a magazine called Scarlet available it is written for women by mainly women If you can get her a copy that might help and they do have a help page as well.

He was really comforting, like you seem to be, and said it didn't matter. Eventually one day, i'll skip the dirty details ;), we were hanging out and decided to try to have sex again, this time I was really for it, there was a lot of foreplay and i was in the mood, everything seemed good. After we had sex I didn't feel the pain anymore! I told one of my friends about and she said that sometimes, when the girl isn't really feeling it (as in she's not really in the mood even though she might seem to be) the sex hurts.     Try a lot of foreplay, and be nice and gentle. Im almost 100% sure it'll stop hurting her. Also make sure that there's a good amount of lubrication, store bought or natural ;)

zX4nU1Rtaa	Is it safe to get an X-ray while I'm pregnant?    Expert Answers  Lori Wolfe, genetic counselor    Yes, it's often safe to get an X-ray during pregnancy. The level of safety depends on the type of X-ray you need and exactly how much radiation you're going to be exposed to.    Most diagnostic X-rays don't expose the fetus to high enough levels of radiation to cause a problem. It is true, though, that the greater your exposure is to radiation, the greater the risk could be to your baby.    While fetal exposure over 10 rads (the unit of measurement for absorbed radiation) has been shown to increase the risks for mental retardation and eye abnormalities, you needn't worry. It's rare for a single X-ray or group of diagnostic X-rays to exceed 5 rads.    For example, the amount of radiation that a baby gets from a mother's dental X-ray is only 0.01 millirad. Since a rad is equal to 1,000 millirads, one would have to have 100,000 dental X-rays for the baby to receive just one rad. Other estimated fetal doses are 60 millirads for a chest X-ray, 290 millirads for an abdominal X-ray, and 800 millirads for a computerized tomographic (CT) scan.    To put this in perspective, during the normal course of a pregnancy you and your baby are exposed to about 90 to 100 millirads of natural radiation from the sun and earth.    Although the risk from diagnostic X-rays is low, experts often recommend that women postpone getting unnecessary X-rays until after giving birth. But if your doctor feels X-rays are needed for your particular medical situation, it should ease your mind to know that the amount of radiation your baby will receive will most likely be well within the safe range. If you do have an X-ray, make sure the technician knows you're pregnant so she can properly shield you.    If you were receiving radiation for cancer therapy before learning you were pregnant, talk to your oncologist about the amount of radiation your baby may have received, and ask for a referral to a teratogen specialist or genetic counselor.    If you're around radiation at work, talk to your supervisor about ways to reduce or eliminate your exposure. You may want to discuss the possibility of wearing a special kind of film badge that monitors the amount of radiation you receive. You can even wear a badge on your stomach under your safety apron. The badges can be analyzed as needed to make sure you and your baby are safe.    Contact your local Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) if you're concerned that your employer isn't addressing safety issues. OSHA is the U.S. government agency responsible for overseeing safety in the workplace.|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	The anesthetic used by dentists is considered generally safe in pregnancy (Category B, the same category as Tylenol)  The xray shield is mostly cosmetic at this point.  The radiation does not spread beyond about a 4 inch diameter circle.  In the "old days" there was all kinds of radiation spread.  Using 2 shields is mostly just for the psychological benefit of the patient.  Many times, I didn't (and don't) leave the room during an xray during my 3 pregnancies. I even had a root canal during the first pregnancy while wearing a radiation detection badge.  We forgot the shield, but my badge detected no radiation.  Infections in the mouth are more likely to cause preterm labor and low birth weight babies.  You and your baby will be fine from this dental work  Good luck|`|AA10144532	I think you are fine. A dentist would not do anything that would compromise your baby. If you are really worried call your doctor for reassurance. I had a tooth pulled with my third child and he is perfectly fine....i was 10 weeks along. I cant remember whether they used one or two shields but the amount of radiation used is minimal. Don't worry, pregnant women work in dental offices and their children are healthy. Congratulations!!

I think a friend told me it could be a hemorrhage in my stomach or whatever, but when I'm not working out much, and doing no more than 30 minutes of cardio a day (which can even be questioned if it's cardio or not, more like power walking from class to class, and then to the train) If some one answers this question they'd also be aiding me!
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It does seem a lot, however I don't think it's up to us to judge whether or not that is excessive. It's a personal opinion as to what is the 'normal' amount of partners one should have. Obviously you have had a fair few, so my advise would be just to make sure everything you do is protected.     Condoms alone can have up to a 15% fail rate and best estimate is that they offer only 50% protection against STIs- this is because some STIs can be spread just via sexual contact. For you to have posted this question it must mean that it is playing on your mind- I doubt you are alone, some would say you only get one stab at life, why not have some fun.    The main risk from having many sexual partners is of course STIs do just make sure that you have regular STI screening.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	50 does seem a lot.

LDMV3WUTaa	Did YOU mean "penis PUMP" ??? Instead of "pumo", I"m guessing YOU did!!!    And just so YOU know, the pumps for penises, work temporarily, from what I've heard. They are NOT permanent, enlargements!!!|`|osY0xlhTaa	Depends what you're using it for. Penis pumps work by creating a vacuum, so that when you put them on, the vacuum draws blood into the penis, giving you an erection. As a treatment for impotence, it does work (although you need a penis ring of some sort, otherwise when you take the pump of, the blood just goes back out & you've lost your erection.)    As a penis enlargement device, they don't work. Once you take the pump of, the blood drains out again, so at best you get bigger for a few minutes.    A much better option if this is what you're after is enlargement exercises - they can give permanent gains, if you do them right.    A good site with lots of info is http://www.biggerbetterman.com
9D8BX3Jtaa	Best and cheapest cardio exercise to do at home is  jumping rope. Start by jumping rope for a minute, then rest one. Do this 5 to 10 times at first.  Work your way up by jumping then for 2 minutes then rest for one, and so on. You might think its sissy at first, but in fact you get pretty intense workout .|`|Lh57ukzqaa	Running in place is better than nothing. Maybe an exercise video?  Do you have stairs? Possibly running up and down stairs, or stepping up and back down on one stair, and increasing speed when you get better... you could even do two steps at a time.  How about walking, i mean that would mean outside... but its easy, and if you do it long enough, you will burn a significant amount of calories.  Hope I helped!

AA11773207	Being in college is really a busy time and you probably are exhausted.  Make sure you're getting enough rest.  Take a week or so and go to bed really early to help you reset your body clock.  You can also try using melatonin, which you can buy in the health food store.  It's a natural hormone that helps regulate your sleep / wake cycles.  Take 2-3 mgs every evening about an hour before you go to sleep and it should help you fall asleep more easily and help you sleep more deeply which will help your body to be better rested.  If all else fails, perhaps you just are not naturally a morning person.  Try to schedule your classes later in the day and evening next semester.  Good luck!|`|n9p80eaUaa	sleeping is a waste of life and scientists have proven that we really don't need 8 to 9 hours of sleep its all in our head. just u know say im wasting my life when u don't wanna get up lol haha idk jut have a cup of water leave it next to ur bed and when u hear ur alarm splash it in ur face.|`|VJ0R5on5aa	Are you getting enough sleep?

11861200032b6a8d424b34dfb3259c84aa	Well not trying to be rude but, you wasted your money. The products that claim to cleanse your body of harmful toxins are just such a farce. If the FDA would actually do something about all these so called health food products and actually hold them to real scientific test done by professional Dr's and scientist.

I now work with kids with these disorders and we use a positive reward system and a journal/drawing system to let their feelings out.  The positive reward system works real well, but if a child has gotten to the point where human help for acting-out or anger won't work , we have them draw and color on paper and let them get their anger out.

Ask your parents if either of them were chubby when they were young. If so then you'll lose your fat and grow into your body. If it ISN'T genetic then think about this: The taller you are, the more you're going to weigh. Muscle weighs more than fat. If the only exercise you're getting is hockey, then that isn't good. You should exercise for at least 45 minutes every day. If you feel like doing more than that then great! My sister sounds a lot like that. Try swimming. She recently took up swimming and i can notice a huge difference in her body. She's probably lost at least 2 inches off her waist and shes been doing swimming since like september?? idk. but yeahh. Try doing that. :] good luck!|`|hkkbpUZsaa	u r 5'4 and u weigh 148 pounds  that's not 2 bad  besides, u should listen 2 wat other pple think, if u r really that worried u could always ask ur doctor if u r obese  also, this site will really help; it can tell u whether or not u mite want 2 start a healthier diet or not:  http://mypyramid.gov/
mqXyDTwwaa	Sweating doesn't have anything to do with burning fat. Sweat just keeps you cool. And running doesn't burn fat off your legs. Any cardio burns fat from the last place you gained it. So if you gain fat around your waist, then running will burn fat off your waist. If you gain fat around your chest, then running will burn fat off your chest.|`|lEX3CjWlaa	Different people and even different parts of a person's body sweat in different ways. Some people sweat a great deal even with mild exercise. Some hardly ever sweat even with grueling work. Some people sweat most through their chest, others by their backs.    So don't get worried if your legs don't sweat. Sweating has nothing to do with muscle build up or burning of fat. Sweating is the body's way of not overheating. Just work on your running plan and your legs will tone up and look just great.    Hope this Helps|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I run 5-6 days a week.  2-3 miles.  My legs dont really ever sweat that i have noticed.  I really work up a sweat and my shirt is soaked as well as "excuse the grossness" my crotch.  It looks like i peed myself some days.  My legs have gone down alot in the past 4 months, that is when i started running.  I also do weights and other cardio.  If that is all you are doing you might not notice a huge difference.  Make sure you are working up a sweat and getting a little winded.  Run faster and or longer each week even if it is just 3 minutes or 1-2 mph.|`|sYxtPBziaa	If they don't sweat, that means that your body is not generating heat, which means your heart is not beating as fast as it should be to be in fat burning mode, which means you aren't burning all of the calories you could be burning if you were to run at a higher intensity. Try jogging with an incline. Makes your legs work harder, which forces your body to use fat and turn it into energy and by doing this your body raises your heart rate and you begin to sweat.
j3RjgpC1aa	Straddle a pillow, take a maxi pad, soak it with warm-hot water, put it in your panties. Pull your panties up and ride on something: Floor, side of tub.     I used a maxi pad in the shower. Instead of using panties, use a bathing suit bottom. Soak the pad and stick it into suit bottom. I sat down on the floor of the tub and rub myself against my leg, and then a shampoo bottle. Everything down below was wet and by the time I was done, I was shaky and felt so good. I long to do it again, but I have my period.|`|711KONwOaa	use a virabator   like an electric toothbrush or a vibratior from a neck massager or something.  hope this helps
hZlwaaP2aa	this is all what i do, and it could vary from girl to girl but i hope this helps!     1. Using a tampon won't shorten your period. A tampon is just a subsitute for a pad, it's not like magic, lol ;)  2. You'll feel if it's in the right place. If you haven't already had sex I don't really think using a tampon would be the best idea for you.. because it wouldn't be very comfortable!  3- a tampon is easier than a pad because when you move while wearing a pad sometimes you can feel the actual pad and it's just awkward. Also when you're only wearing a pad you're always nervous that maybe it's not doing what it's supposed to do... and... you know :\  4- I really like the tampax pearl. I use the thin ones, just because using jumbo or anything is obviously just.. weird and shouldn't be used unless you're like really loose or something which im assuming you're not! just look for thin ones that are good for heavy flows, it says it on the box.     good luck!|`|7ilEjRxeaa	1. It seems to make it shorter for me, but I don't know if it's an absolute fact.  2. You'll know because you won't feel it  3. Yes, yes, YESSSSS. Much less of a mess, and it's way better protection  4. I use Platex super plus (: I have a pretty heavy flow  Make sure you change it ever 4-6 hours if you have a heavy flow    And make sure it's in all the way or it'll hurt|`|c22a32bba4392e7e1e871d12549ff87daa	Go to www.beingagirl.com    You'll find all kinds of answers there.|`|Le1NKfdZaa	1. well its bout the same if u were wearing a pad  2. u know if u cant fell it at all  3.

XD8UYkMIaa	Dieting can be hard, but it is very rewarding in the end.  As long as you're determined enough, you can get to your goal.    First, you need to find out how many calories you should be eating for your height, weight, gender, age, etc.  You're supposed to have a 500 calorie deficit to lose one pound per week.  That means that if you burn 2000 calories a day by simply living and doing normal daily activities PLUS exercise or any extra activity you do throughout the day, you should eat 1500 calories to lose 1lbs per week.  This is a great site to use in order to figure this all out:  http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie...  But, also keep in mind that it may not be fully accurate.      Also, exercising is VERY important for any diet, weight loss or not.  It burns extra calories, too! It's definitely a plus.  At least three times a week can go a long way as long as you're doing the right things :)     As far as what you eat goes, don't be TOO strict, but make sure you have your limits.  There are tons of alternative foods out there that have less calories, fat, carbohydrates, cholesterol, etc in them and taste just as great! I'm subscribed to Hungry Girl, which is a wonderful way to get the scoop on new "diet foods" out there and delicious and easy recipes.  Go here to check it out:  http://hungry-girl.com/    Honestly, you can eat anything you want and still lose weight as long as you eat the right deficit.  However, it's smart to eat healthily.  It'll only benefit you in the long run.  It's smarter to develop good eating habits now, instead of regretting not doing so in the future.      For breakfast, you can have a cup of Kashi cereal with 1/2 cup skim milk, whole wheat Eggo Waffles (yes! they have them and they're delicious!) with a tablespoon light butter (I prefer Smart Balance), or some veggie sausage and some whole wheat toast with sugar free jam (all of which is also very tasty, even if it sounds disgusting).      For lunch, eat a sandwich with whole wheat bread, turkey, veggies (if you like them), or a great healthy spread like hummus (I've never had it myself, but everyone that has loves it), and have some fruit on the side.  You could also have a whole can of Progresso Light soup that yields 2 whole cups! The entire can is only 120-160 calories!      For dinner, have something like grilled chicken or fish, with brown rice and veggies on the side! You can try veggie or soy burgers on a light whole wheat bun, and then have some fruit with it as well.      Make sure you try to balance out your meals (you know, make sure you have carbohydrates, protein, and good fats), and drink plenty of water.      An AMAZING site for more nutritional info, calorie counter, and forums is:  caloriecount.about.com    I hope I helped a bit.  Anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but I think I gave the right information.  Contact me if you have any more questions :)    (sorry it's so long, btw :/)|`|B12E4rYiaa	You need to eat low calorie low fat foods, small portions, and no seconds. Cereal is good for breakfast since there are all kinds of healthy cereals on the market. Turkey, tuna, chicken all white meat on whole grain bread at lunch with small salad or fruit. Dinner lean fish or meat, veggies, forget the bread eat some crackers instead. Jello for dessert and if you get hungry eat an apple or something else healthy. Drink lots of water it will keep you full. Count all calories, food and drink & log it.    Do an exercise program you enjoy 3-5 days a week. If you do this you will lose. Good luck
94NYYq5Haa	change the way you study.  Reading and making flash cards are passive methods. Try something more active.  After you read something, take a few minutes to write a brief summary of what you read.  If you are reading something long, do this in sections.  Wait a while and then try to repeat the summary back to yourself to see if you can remember it.  Try also making up your own exam questions and answering them.  You need to get to the point where you can easily recall facts rather than just recognizing them when they are on the paper in front of you.  Then, when you get to the test, it won't matter whether or not you are anxious.    You just need to put more work into studying.|`|ParFJxnSaa	If you are one of the 40% of people who are fairly suggestible, you may wish to consider professional hypnotherapy, or: Overcoming Exam Nerves -  Overcoming Exam Nerves Hypnosis Download  www.hypnosisdownloads.com    Sorry, I'm too busy being my own coward , to be anybody's hero!|`|dppzuH8raa	Okay.

F9Ll7oLJaa	both are equally important|`|ParFJxnSaa	See Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris in sections 33 - 34, and examine the http://1-800-therapist.com/ & http://www.metanoia.org/choose/ websites, and use the locators in sections 33 - 34, and section 1, and phone book, and/or various associations for psychiatrists and psychologists, to find the nearest one using EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy).    In EMDR, a therapist will ask you to revisit a traumatic event and remember the feelings, negative thoughts, or memories associated with it. While you are doing this, the therapist will hold up two fingers about eighteen inches from your face and move them from side to side. You will be told to track the movement of the therapists fingers with your eyes.     As you concentrate on the traumatic event during therapy, you are trying to bring its memory to life. The mental imagery you are able to conjure up during the therapy session is then processed, aided by your eye movements, facilitating the processing of painful memories, enabling some of the powerful emotional states involved to be discharged to some degree, and helping to achieve resolution and a state involving less painful emotions.    EMDR has 8 stages. Professional EMDR is always much preferable, and Opester, (who gives it a glowing recommendation) a therapist with more than 20 years experience, and a former contributor, here, stated that it was one of only two disorders which can be completely cured.    If unable to afford it, or to locate one nearby, contact the county/local mental health agency: any therapy on offer may prove helpful, particularly if combined with appropriate medication. Contact your county/local mental health agency, and find out what help they can offer. (U.S.A.) Try phoning 211, or 411, and Google: "clinics; mhmr; (your city); (your state)" Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is also recommended, and has been used successfully, with PTSD. Some people, however, may benefit more from psychotherapy, or counselling, at least until they are some way along the path to wellness, and feeling psychologically robust enough for the harsher CBT. See: BENEFITS OF HOMEOPATHY QUESTIONED, in section 81, at ezy build.|`|AA12156890	Medications  Several types of medications can help symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder get better. Antidepressants can help symptoms of both depression and anxiety. They can also help improve sleep problems and improve your concentration. Anti-anxiety medications also can improve feelings of anxiety and stress.    Which medications are best for you depends on your specific symptoms and situation. You and your doctor will work together to find medications that work well and have the fewest side effects. It may take a few tries. But you may see an improvement in your mood and other symptoms within a few weeks. Be sure to tell your health care professional about any side effects or problems you have with the medications, as you may be able to try something different.    Psychotherapy  Several forms of therapy may be used to treat both children and adults with post-traumatic stress disorder. Which form is best for you depends on your symptoms and situation. You may try one type and then a different type of therapy, or combine elements of several. You may also try individual therapy, group therapy or both. Group therapy can offer a way to connect to others going through similar experiences.    Some types of therapy used in PTSD treatment include:        * Cognitive therapy      * Cognitive behavior therapy      * Exposure therapy    All these approaches can help you gain control of the fear and distress that happen after a traumatic event. They can help you learn more about why you have certain feelings and thoughts, and how to replace them with more positive and realistic thinking. You may also gain skills in stress management and healthy coping. Through psychotherapy, you learn ways to cope so that you don't feel overwhelmed by thoughts and feelings related to your traumatic experience. The type of therapy that may be best for you depends on a number of factors that you and your health care professional can discuss.    Medications and psychotherapy also can help you if you've developed other problems related to your traumatic experience, such as depression, anxiety, alcohol or substance abuse. You don't have to try to handle the burden of PTSD on your own.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	The best treatment for PTSD is counseling.

q9i5f0rXaa	Some people have a hard time activating their glute muscles during exercise, which means they don't see any attention.  If you sit a lot, this is a pretty common problem.  Couple things you should do:    1)  Stretch your quadriceps  2)  Perform some glute activation drills such as the glute bridge (Google is your friend)    That should get you to the point of being able to feel them working during your current exercises.    Another exercise you can try that seldom fails to give great results is the split squat:    http://www.myhomepersonaltrainer.net/exe...    For further glute recruitment, you can lean your torso farther forward than what is pictured in the above link.  Hope that helps.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Okay well first of all 2 weeks is only break in period.. not enough time to see any difference.  Muscle growth takes 6-9 weeks depending on how much you work it.  So don't even expect to see anything really noticeable for a month and a half to two months.  Also, a better exercise is to get a foldout ladder like a three step utility ladder (home depot) and then holding a ten pound weight in each hand, go up and down the ladder.  It will take a couple days to figure out your coordination and balance.

7kfY9e4haa	Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.  It sounds like you are really struggling with your relationships at home.with your parents.  Remember, they get it wrong sometimes, but I am sure they love you and want what is in your best interest.  Don;t seek validation from the world, it will never give you what you need.  You must find it in yourself.   Always ask yourself, will this matter in a week? a month? a year? 10 years?  I know it seems like you will be with your parents forever but it will be over and you will be an adult in no time.    Another suggestion, try volunteering in some way that is completely unselfish, hospital, animal shelter, church, whatever you enjoy.

Work on your mind, on accepting stressful things in life, and they wont be stressful anymore.   Just think of something that you used to think sucked, and now that youve become used to it and more confident about it, you no longer mind it. Thats the mentality you should have in order to avoid stress, and the accompanying pain.
9iXGakohaa	Load up on carbs and protein. Lots of meat, breads, pasta etc. Exercising will also help you gain weight because muscle weighs more than fat.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Most times, the reaction is to the anesthetic.  The anesthetic has epinepherine in it, so it can cause a racing heart.  Generally it will elevate to 130-140 or so.  Yours just went soaring a little too high to be considered safe.  Sometimes the anesthetic causes a drop in blood pressure as well and that'll send the heart rate up.  To be safe, your surgeon is getting a consult.|`|RoDjZKknaa	HI   Try not to worry, often in dental anesthetics epinephrine is used to help keep the anesthetic in the area it is needed to be.  Sometimes people have reactions to this epi and their heart races. Some people have to use anesthetics without the epi.  The fact that your heart rate increased in an hour is interesting.  Usually an hour would be considered a very long time to extract wisdom teeth, most wisdom extractions are about 5 minutes per tooth or less!  My concern for you would be why they had you on the IV so long?    Ask lots of questions when you go to the heart doctor, and take someone with you to take notes.  Sometimes it's good to have someone there with you because you can't remember everything they say.  Good luck|`|6B8ji9Ncaa	I can understand you are probably very upset by this experience and it can be very maddening to wait for appt to find out what is the matter. A lot of people have adverse affects to anesthesia. Definitly go to a heart specialist and ask a lot of questions. The dentist is an expert in teeth - so don't hang your hat on his opinion. Go to a heart doctor and in the meantime, thank God your still alive. And definitly get more than one opinion! Go to several doctors. Best Wishes.

The source of your anxiety and depression sounds very physical.   Seriously, meds can help.   They can also harm, though.

But I don't regret trying all the medications that I have, because some have worked for me.

ec230a6ecc277d797ff299d8eda9ce68aa	Wow.  Good for you for resolving your eating disorder.  Your problems could all come from that.  You really do harm to your body when you either don't eat, or don't eat right.      Unless you are a good 16 weeks or more pregnant, you are not feeling a baby move in your belly.  It would be like crazy impossible.  If you are a really skinny person, it could be gas moving around.     Your best bet is to wait patiently for the doctor to tell you what is going on with your body.  If you worry about it now, or listen to too many different opinions, it will just make you crazy.    My advice...... Relax, enjoy the weekend (hopefully, you will feel up to it.) and see the doctor on Monday.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	you might have irritable bowel syndrome or another gastrointestinal problem. the movement was probably a result of a large amount of gas.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	eliminate all milk products from your diet, keep a food diary, take probiotics, drink lotsa water, and see your doctor.

It will take time, be patient and support her.|`|s4fZdNC3aa	i think it bc of the miscarriage.. try talking to her that kind of stuff mess with your head, heart and body. if you love her work it out|`|e7TGKv8vaa	First of all, she's grieving.  And for most, 2 months is just not a long time esp when losing a baby.  In the case of a secondly you feel as if there is noone to blame but yourself.  Only you were a part of fulfulling the baby's needs.  Secondly, yes, I do believe her hormones could be outta whack.  Which could also be why she miscarried.  Suggest she get her progesterone levels checked.  When you are pregnant your progesterone levels skyrocket.  But for some, this doesn't happen which can lead to miscarriage.  On the same note, after a baby is born, they plummet back to "normal" but the crash can cause huge mood issues and often is the cause of post partum depression.  I have not found a better progesterone creme than Prolief from Arbonne.  Also, don't run.  Hold her close and be sure she knows that noone, esp you, blames her for losing the baby.
iK3YYRaTaa	What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels        There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes.     Fasting Blood Sugar Test:  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test.     Random Blood Glucose Test:  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes.     Oral glucose tolerance test  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus.     Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes.     Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have.         Protein in urine (Proteinuria)    What is it?   Along with fats and sugars, proteins form the major building blocks for our bodies. The right amount of protein is important in our diets, for growth and repair.     Protein is present in the blood; healthy kidneys should only filter tiny (trace) amounts into the urine as most protein molecules are too large for the filters (glomeruli).     It is not usual to lose protein in the urine. When this does happen it is known as Proteinuria.     Several proteins can be found in the urine, but the most relevant to kidney disease is albumin.     Protein in the urine is not usually obvious, but can be detected by a simple dip- stick test, or sometimes by more sensitive lab tests.     The presence of protein in the urine can act as a warning signal that not all is well with the kidneys.     Symptoms  Usually there are no symptoms.   If the protein loss is heavy, the urine has a frothy appearance, and would most likely be associated with other symptoms e.g. oedema, where there is an excess of water in the body tissues.   Possible causes of Proteinuria  Diseases of the glomeruli (the kidneys filtering units), for example Glomerulonephritis or Diabetes.   Urine infection can cause proteinuria, but usually there are other signs of this  see Cystitis/Urinary Tract Infections) .   Proteinuria can also be a symptom of some other conditions and diseases: for example: congestive heart failure, a first warning of eclampsia in pregnancy.   Sometimes a positive dipstick for protein isnt abnormal, for example concentrated samples first thing in the morning, or if you have become dehydrated or havent drunk much. Lab tests can sort this out (protein/creatinine ratio or albumin/creatinine ratio).   Temporary proteinuria may occur after vigorous exercise or if you have a high fever   Sometimes, almost always in children, proteinuria can be detected later in the day, but not in the morning. This is known as orthostatic Proteinuria and it is usually harmless.   What does it mean?  Proteinuria means there is something wrong with the kidney. Some warning signals make it more likely to be an important kidney problem:     Large amounts of protein in the urine.   There are also positive tests for blood in the urine   Abnormal kidney tests (creatinine or eGFR)   High blood pressure   You are young   Heavy Proteinuria e.g. more than 2-3g per day, or a protein/creatinine ratio (PCR) of 200-300 or more will usually need investigation to find out the cause, unless it is obvious already.      Good luck>|`|f8mLpPXlaa	The same as everyone else's, 80-120|`|9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	No. Glucose (blood sugar) levels should be 80-120 and under 150 two hours after eating. Protein in your pee is a different issue. You should make an apt with your OB for a urine test. don't worry, this can happen for a number of reasons.     If you used a urine stick for your protein test was the glucose pad a dark color? if it was please call your doctor and make an apt right away as that would signal that you are "spilling" sugar into your urine. That can be a big problem, so do not delay in getting to a doctor. Even a walk in clinic where they can double check your test.    Are you peeing like crazy and super thirsty?  early morning glucose number above 125?  weight loss?  dizzy?  tired?    If yes, please get to a doctor ASAP.    Good Luck!

Iub2QWaIaa	I think you have bigger fish to fry right now. You need to see a orthopedic doctor or a neurosurgeon and not a chiropractor. You also need to get an attorney to deal with the workers compensation issue you have. Once you get through all that red tape if you still feel like you want to file a malpractice case you can, but I think you're going to be busy for awhile.|`|kpi69PHWaa	I think a malpractice suit would be frivolous. Talk about jacking the legal system. Your health was not negatively affected. You did not lose anything from this (outside of the workman's comp thing, which is a payment issue, and not related to your medical treatment)   The workman's comp doctor looked at imaging, which is entirely appropriate, and did not find evidence of acute injury. It's possible you did have kidney stones, and that by the time you saw the other doctor (10 days later), they had passed or moved, and your urine would not show evidence of stones.     Like you said, you are not a doctor. You don't know what those MRI findings mean (and, incidentally neither do I). They could be chronic changes, they could be from a long ago injury. If you don't understand the reading, call the office that ordered the MRI and set up an appointment to go over your results with the DOCTOR.  I also question whether a chiropractor's diagnosis will be covered under workman's comp. Don't hang your hat on that diagnosis.    I do see a hole in the argument that it's kidney stones and not back strain/injury. If the initial doctor you went to truly xrayed your back (rather than doing a CT), I don't know that it's possible to tell if the stones are obstructing or non-obstructive. Especially if a urine test was not done at that time. If the stones are non-obstructive, they would not necessarily cause pain. Therefore, even if you do have kidney stones, you could still have some other etiology of your pain.      Moral of the story: please don't sue. That's ridiculous and irresponsible. Not to mention nothing wrong (medically) happened. On the other hand, you do potentially have a workman's comp case.   Good luck getting your legitimate claims covered!

Try cutting your schedule down a bit and see if it helps.|`|dCF1UBUsaa	I would say it would definitely help. It makes you extremely focused and your mental state improves greatly. Don't abuse it, I've heard of people ending up in real bad shape from Adderall.|`|s4iVl04raa	It may help, (it helped me in high school), but you have to weigh the pros and cons. Adderall can have some extreme side effects and cause addiction. If you need something just for school, you might want to consider something else!|`|jg9w6IbQaa	if you really do have ADD i'm sure it will help. but please be careful. I don't need adderall in any way but i abused it for months on end. luckily i was able to stop on my own, but that little orange pill is still my weakness.|`|77hFQXgLaa	yes it will help. get adderall xr so that it lasts all day. ive tried it once, it was amazing how well i could focus in school, and it wasnt so boring doing work, sort of fun-ish.it was a 15 mg adderall xr. i took it right when i got to school, and i didnt feel anything until i got into first period. it was probably 20 minutes after i took it, i kinda felt like i was in a trance. it wasnt like the weed high or being drunk, i could control myself and **** so its notlike i was stoned. i had a better sense for what was going on, felt kinda jittery. my teacher became totally stupid, it seemed i had a much greater understanding of whatever it was we were doing. it was a pretty good feeling. i could do my work a lot better, i finished fast, it was great.  at lunch i wasnt very hungry, so i guess the weakend hunger side effect hit me. the effects were fun for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd period. about the middle of 4th period, i felt the crash. it was deffinitly worse than the come down of weed, but not as bad as a hangover. it lasted about 20 or 30 minutes, this tired feeling, bored, didnt want to do my work, etc. it wore off and i went to lacrosse after school. pretty much the experience was a good one. i liked the feeling of adderall, and i think it can be alot of fun if used once in a while. i do know you can get addicted to it, so i wouldnt use it often if you dont have a perscription.
4LsF70cjaa	Your IUD does not have anything to do with the function of your ovaries.  And yes, ovarian cysts can be very painful.  I am really surprised that your doctor didn't give you anything for pain, but since she didn't you might try some ibuprofen or naproxin sodium if you are not allergic.  These things usually clear up by themselves but a few women sometimes require some intervention if the cyst/s are exceptionally large or troublesome.|`|eiFQ0mHCaa	I had an IUD removed that I had for about 2 years.  They had to do an ultrasound to try to get it out and saw that I had a large cyst.  I think you can get a cyst because you went off birth control pills.  So, I had to go back on birth control pills and the cyst went away.|`|CJrmskrnaa	If you had the one with hormones in it, Mirena, it can cause ovarian cysts, but they usually go away on their own.
Zd0yuyGlaa	put a bite size piece of ice in the area that hurts. It'll feel VERY cold, obviously, but that cold temperature will take a good deal-if not all- of the pain away.     If that is discontinued, then drink a glass of VERY cold water, put plenty of ice in it to further decrease the water's temperature. The colder, the better.     You can also try an icepack, it'll still feel cold, but that'll help too.    You can also try taking Advil or another over the counter pain killer. It'll take a few minutes to start working, but that-like the above suggestions- will drastically reduce the pain to a level that you will find is well more than bearable. Play video games or do something that takes your mind off of the pain. This is the one of the most useful things you can do, if nothing else, until a pain killer can be accessed.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	Ya those hurt.  Try not to bite down all the way cause that will irritate even more.  Take 2 extra strength Tylenol then 2-3 hours later take 2 Advil then 3 hours later Tylenol (keep going like that).  No more than 8 Tylenol in 24 hours (4,000 mg) or 12 Advil/Ibuprofen.  And try some Tylenol PM at night to help you sleep.  Eat soft stuff; yogurt, jello, pudding, applesauce, soup, etc.; stuff that doesn't require chewing.  Try a milkshake and or smoothie (you can have them add protein to the smoothie so it holds you longer)  After the pain eases in a few days or so try stuff like pasta, macaroni, bread, etc.  Good luck|`|DqEyrDYhaa	the spacers are nothing compared to when you get the heavier wires in. :D    I got my bottom braces on on the 22nd and I haven't even been able to chew ANYTHING. no bread, no rice, nothing. but thats because I have an overbite and they put this bite block on one tooth.      good thing is I've lost 7 pounds.|`|oNv9UtKvaa	I don't know, its one of those things that will just go away. Do something else to take your mind off.|`|fZhqa3Bdaa	Oh...I hate spacers..um....do you have yogurt, mash potatoes, smoothe, soup. those help everytime I get my braces tightened??|`|vDMASHmLaa	I used to have that too. Im 12 now but its so sore because the spacer is almost too big for the gap!!!! Thats what happened to me! Eat yogurt and gaterade because gaterade has energy in it and that works as vitamin C my friend Anna said.
VA1epT8waa	If you re-injured your ankle then that is usually a sign of stretched ligaments,  don't worry about anything being broken but the next time you do something active with I suggest wearing a brace on it with supports on either side of your ankle, this will greatly reduce your chance of rolling it badly again.    Because it's swollen I would definitely get some ice on that every other 20 min, and wrap and ace bandage around it to keep the swelling down. Elevate it as much as possible while sitting and sleeping by putting a pillow under it. Also stay off it as much as possible.     Because you have aggravated this injury I suggest looking into some physical therapy for it, a lot of it you can do on your own with a thick elastic band.    Good Luck|`|EKM9AKc2aa	Its not that bad. Same thing happen to me.  Its most likely sprain.|`|pz05GLJHaa	It's not good|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	The ankle has 16 bones in it. It sounds to me like you sprained it. If you can walk on it it`s not broken. It will take 6 to 8 weeks to heal a sprain, 4 to 6 weeks to heal a broken bone or bones. Try to let it heal, you may have re sprained it. if so the clock can start over depending on how bad you re injured it. keep it elavated as much as possible to keep the swelling down. ice it with ice wrapped in a towel if no ice packs.hope this will help you some.|`|vdIXzX4naa	Just to be sure go to the doctor or put on an ankle brace for a day or so and see if that helps (a real brace that doesn't let u move the ankle). Hope you get better soon!|`|ZTwGmiwwaa	FELINE AIDS IS THE NUMBER ONE KILLER OF CATS!!!!!  BECOME AWARE AND AWARE OTHERS!!|`|QBFjMRfuaa	If you can walk on it then its just a sprain...Your fine|`|oruWntCfaa	um... i would go to the doctor to be on the save side a sprang m ankle b4 and i went just to be on the safe side im not a doctor it might not be serios but u never no
LDMV3WUTaa	YEAH!!!  YOU WORRY TOO MUCH!!!|`|oluB6ClPaa	you might just be a late bloomer dude, don't worry you'll hit puberty. just wait.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	probably going to die|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Your probably just getting a late start. If this is still a problem when you're 16, be a good idea to let your doctor check you out. Could be a testosterone deficiency that can be corrected.|`|tuvlFJdsaa	there could be something wrong with you but i wouldnt worry about it.  some women love small penises|`|K5IOSGXAaa	No, you just haven't gotten there yet.|`|ZjfI0dSLaa	Not at all. Puberty hits anywhere between 12 - 17. Your just what they call a late bloomer. Mine hit at about 13 - 14, but it happens, so it doesn't really matter.|`|QoDacJBgaa	No, nothing is wrong with you.  A lot of people take a while to hit puberty, and it is nothing you should be concerned about. I didn't hit puberty until I was 13-14 so it should not be anything to worry about.  And about penis size-  Your penis usually doesn't stop growing until you are 18-19, so don't worry about it.  you are fine|`|Pzcqa5Dbaa	you're gay|`|6XRBclf7aa	Take it from a doctor. You are fine. Everyone starts puberty at different times. It may just take you longer to start puberty and develop. The main thing is just be calm about it if you worry about it you will stress out and cause more issues for yourself.|`|IwrS9zw1aa	you need to plop

Spank it share fun in everyway.|`|nCbYuvS8aa	exfoliate with ky yours and mine
t9Nw86Plaa	Expired pills aren't so much 'dangerous' as they are ineffective.     After the use-by date, the active ingredients in the pills can start to deteriorate - this means that taking the pills won't have the same therapeutic effect.     If you don't need the pills to live (ie. they are just pain-killers or something), then your pain won't be relieved, or it will only have a small pain-relieving effect; but taking them won't kill you. It is only REALLY dangerous if you need the pills to live; this is the time when people can die from taking inactive expired pills.|`|B4YESGmwaa	Are you talking a month or years? If they are old they are often not safe to use as well as not effective. You do not give enough info to give a very good answer. Sorry.|`|26W0Fb2Uaa	ummm well if it's expired then that means it's out of date. you don't eat old bread do you? or any other out-date-foods?  no, cuz it's not safe, so i'm sure taking expired meds would be double the danger!!!!!!!

PAvYZJK2aa	that is false|`|K4zsztkRaa	HAHAHA    no it wont    How can it?    Your body doesn't know if you are masturbating or having sex.  So if sex can't cause it neither can masturbation.    -Connor|`|ZjfI0dSLaa	Nope, that's untrue. That would mean sex gives you spots, and we both know that isn't true.|`|AA11522944	No.... you've got pimples because you are going through puberty.    Jerk away!|`|tX7BKRP1aa	No-I've actually read that regular masturbation (a good sexual health habit), is quite good for your skin.     It certainly won't cause a break out.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Unless masturbation interferes with other activities, there is no such thing as too much. Many teen and pre-teen boys masturbate once or twice a day, and this pattern can continue into adulthood and middle age. More than this or less than this is also quite common.    If you masturbate often, you would want to watch your technique, so as not to chafe the skin on your penis. Other than this, no worries.    It will not interfere with your hormone (testosterone) production, it will not interfere with your growth and development, it will not cause acne, it will not affect your vision, it will not cause hair to grow in your palms, and it won't show. It is also not addictive. Masturbation will not contribute to baldness later in life.    Masturbation will absolutely not affect your future sex life. You will be able to "get off" just fine by other means in the future. It will not cause premature ejaculation (c**mming too fast). You cannot "run out" of sperm or semen, as these are replaced by your body on a continual basis. If you masturbate a good deal, or close together in time, you could notice a temporary reduction in semen, but it will build back up again.    There are some studies showing that regular ejaculation early in life can reduce the incidence of prostate cancer later on.
hHSsMyNpaa	Try to take a little mental trip outside of yourself, and take a look at the poor little girl bent over the toilet puking her guts out. Hasn't the poor kid had enough already ?  Don't you feel just a little sorry for her ?  Tears are welling up in my eyes even now as I type this.  Won't somebody help ?  The only person who can, the only one with the power is the one watching.  You.|`|OLXv3DEAaa	Honestly I just don't think it would work in the long term. This is not an issue of how much willpower you have, you have an illness and you need treatment for it. Really you have two if you count the alcoholism.  You have a pretty extreme problem and even if you stop the binging/purging you will still have the same psychological issues. Same thing with the alcoholism. Until you deal with whatever is going on inside your head you're going to either continue/keep going back to this kind of behavior or you'll develop something new. Or you're going to die.    I'm really not trying to be a jerk or depress you but I don't feel like I should give some cheery and uplifting answer when what you're suggesting is usually almost impossible and could very well end up with you dying pretty quickly? You should go back to inpatient, or at least get some therapy/counseling on your own from some kind of eating disorder specialist.|`|q9i5f0rXaa	Can it be done?  Yes.  Is it going to be easy?  Not at all.  Only you can determine if you're mentally strong enough to do it.  But, that should be self-empowering!  If you can recognize that the only thing that can stop you IS YOU, then you will succeed!  You can't control other people, but you can certainly control yourself.  If you can get that fact to "click" in your mind, the light will go off and you'll be able to handle anything thrown at you.|`|AEAxZEveaa	This is a tough one. I had an eating disorder myself. I've found that most the time it's linked more to anxiety than to actually thinking you're fat. ( I mean, you typically do think you're fat, but that's not really the root of the problem) I found that my anxiety was linked to dietary allergies and was drastically reduced when I changed my diet. That may or may not be your problem, but it's worth looking into. Let me know if you need more info on this.     One other suggestion: I've heard that body building helps people get over eating disorders. I've heard several people say that it saved their life. Now mind you, this is not scientific, but it's like trading one obsessive hobby for another. You won't gain fat, but you will be able to up your food intake and get out of that purging mindset. By the way, what are your trigger foods?|`|9D8BX3Jtaa	After eating, instead of purging go take a walk or some other light exercise, keeping on your mind that it will keep you out of losing weight,     Also eat lots of fiber, it will make you feel your stomach full while passing undigested. Stop buying junk food. Get obsessed about calories and just eat exactly what you need. Read about bulimia, so you truly hit rock bottom, that's the only way you will change your way of thinking.    If you truly think you cant, just seek professional help with a psychologist, it might save your life.|`|282b63c09da8e149a4194accaf494760aa	As you know, you are in a very delicate and perhaps dangerous state with your health due to the bulimia. I have seen girls really 'get well' by going to a nutritionist after trying therapy. They find they can eat more than they thought and maintain muscle while not gaining fat per se. It really has been helpful esp. for young girls terrified of gaining weight. You do not want to gain weight as you think your life will be unhappy but how are you to have a happy life doing what you are doing and depriving your body of essential nutrition. I heard recently, you need a MINIMUM of 1200 calories just for your organs to function normally...An eating disorder specialist can help you in addition. They are often people that had eating disorders themselves and will not judge you. Listen to your MEDICAL DOCTOR!!! You may need an intensive in or out-patient program to get you started on the right track...    Often eating disorders are a sign of some family dysfunction and ones disorder can be a sign  of a life that feels out-of-control emotionally. Are there emotions you are feeling gorged with and want to 'vomit' out but maybe have not identified what they are yet and need help to appropriately deal with them? Distractions are good...volunteer, change where you are at certain times of the day you are tempted. Puzzles have worked with someone trying to quit smoking as she needed something to do with her hands. DBT therapy may help you with other distraction ideas.     Ultimately you need to start with a MEDICAL approach. Psych MD's can direct you to the best resource for you also within the area if you MD can not. This is SERIOUS...you are sabatoging your treatment and there are underlying reasons for this only you and your therapist can uncover but ultimately you need to first deal with the behavior and again, an intensive outpatient program for eating disorders is what I would strongly urge you to consider. As you said it will be a 'major, major change to stop' and that is true for any of us as we get used to our 'comfortable misery'. Dr. Phil had a show on this and he visited a girl in the hospital as she was seriously declining and he was her last hope. Your 'case' is severe. PLEASE seek immediate help. You will not be able to do this on your own from what you described above. You are too valuable to risk your health another day. Call for help now, please!|`|oheJaFsPaa	you obviously can't stop by yourself. you're being totally unrealistic if you think you can. you have a serious problem so just simply telling yourself you want to stop is not gonna make it happen. i know this might sound crazy, but have you ever thought of going in for hypnosis? i know some people think it's a waste of time, but you may find yourself amazed at what it can do. if you google it, a lot of celebs are getting into it for weight loss, and many other things. at least give it a try.
JHlS5VDMaa	Most immunizations are required to be given IM- intramuscularly.  Your buttock is one of the larger muscles with the fewest major vessels and nerve bundles within/throughout the muscle tissue.  This lowers the chance of a bad localized reaction to the vaccination.  You can also place more fluid (most vaccines are generally 0.5ml-1ml) within the muscle tissue than you can just under the skin (sub-cutaneously- generally no more than 0.2ml)  IM injections are also commonly given in the upper arms (think flu shot), outer thigh or hip for adults. For kids though, the buttocks are usually the 'go to' site for injections- easier (and safer) to give an injection in this area while a child is trying to squirm away from the needle.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	depends where they have to go. Some injections are IM (intramuscular), some are SC (subcutaneous), some are intradermal....where they give the injection depends on that. If the nurse has to give an IM injection, many are only comfortable with giving them in 1 area to ensure it reaches the muscle, same with other locations.     hope this makes sense, Im tired sorry :).|`|e3eed8e1848cf66173578a71330925b5aa	intramascular vaccines are given their because it is a bulky area and hidden so if a scar developed wont be seen|`|sdFoawrIaa	they are given there because of the way the drug enters the body.  some drugs require it goes through your vain, some into your muscle and some in the fat layers of your skin.|`|9ko5WUFkaa	The types of vaccines that they give on the buttocks needs to go into muscle.  This is good area of muscle that you don't really use (like an arm).  These same injections can be given in the arm or thigh but as you use these muscles all the time it can hurt or ache for longer.  It also tens to hurt less in the butt.  This is why they do it, but if you really prefer you can ask to be given the shot in your arm.|`|46ddc6b6990fcd5b5d5e36dc7b533ccaaa	Becasue some are bigger than others (more volume) and it would hurt to much to put it in the muscle in the arm so the thigh or bum is used!!!
RXI8ImdIaa	You need a doctor to investigate this ASAP. If you are having trouble breathing, that's an issue that must be figured out. If your doctor will not deal with it, go to another doctor.

Kswn0Aqcaa	Maybe these particular people are racist, but if you look at everyone now a days, it is decreasing!  You should try making friends with a different crowd. Maybe they'll be more accepting and kind.  Of course there is hope. I'm guessing you are a preteen or teenager, judging by how you said playdate and are so concerned with friends.  Once you get older everything will get better. You'll find new people and your life will come together.    Do not cut yourself or stab yourself.  I'm sure your parents still love you and you are not invisible.  Maybe they don't like seeing you depressed.    Cheer up.    When I was younger, my friends weren't that great. They seemed so at the time, but I was wrong.  Now I have two groups of friends. One is completely reliable, and the other is not.  Maybe that's how it can be for you.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours.

People don't know what effect they have on each other. I've gone through the loneliness, the prejudice, the feeling that that knife is the thing that's going to make things better... but I've also had that feeling after you do it that you get when you realize you shouldn't have. And I've experienced, after years finally, that feeling that people do care no matter what. If your friends are making you feel this way and are just telling you that they're your friend, not really listening, MAKE them listen. And if they still don't, then they aren't real friends. And parents do that a lot, and it isn't one bit fair, but don't blame it on racism. Not that part. Instead of thinking of people as unfair or racist, just think that they are the ones with mental instability and they just need help, it's not the fact your Asian.    I'm sorry if I didn't help, but I understand.|`|5MxYOnzdaa	Ok, well. I don't know how old you are, so connecting and telling you everything will be ok may not work... well, Im 17, and I am partially Japanese and Native American. .. and well I get crap every so often about how Im such a mutt. And, well its a tough punch to recover from because, hey, you can't help it. But, really everything will be ok. Just know you're bigger than that... really, based on how well you write I can tell your a bright person. So, honestly... Im going to be very blunt and just say, man-up a little. I trust you'll be fine because you recognized the cutting thing was a set back and it was wrong afterward. I promise you this will all pass, not right away because there's no easy button out of life, ya just gotta cope, and deal because when the time comes, you will be looking down on them... because CLEARLY they are really really immature, even those parents. If you ever need someone to talk to, send a message my way... really, it'd be no problem. And, please, no more talk of knifes to the throat, that will solve nothing, just make a mess. Now . . .if I were your friend with one of those parents... just know I would be taking action and showing you things can still work out... but, ya know... some people are just talkers and not showers... sorry. Its the way life works. Good luck, and please, cut the knife crap, you and I both know that would solve absolutely nothing and you'd throw away everything that could be.|`|naA4Z46qaa	dont_look_left@hotmail.com|`|lR1vbA1faa	Hmm, sounds to me like you just need to find better friends. I have a couple friends who are Asian, and they are some of the coolest people I've met. And I understand how you feel, I can count the number of friends I have on one hand, and we rarely hang out. Anyway, just hang in there, eventually things will get better, they always do! Cheers =).|`|x37gLE4yaa	"sigh, that knife looks pretty good in my throat"---> Please- try not to think of that. I went through stages like you not to long ago. But NEVER EVER think about committing suicide. First off, think of how many you would hurt- like your parents.  And also, you have so much left to achieve in this world. If you just throw your life away now, you will never be able to be someone in the world and prove people wrong about you. Also, these people may or may not be racist, but they sound like the type of parents that are real jerks. Don't worry about it too much. You sound like a really good person- and you aren't bi-polar. People just say that to you because they do not know what else to say.  And if you feel that it is just a one-sided relationship then chances are it isn't a good relationship- there are other people you could become friends with- try another group and you prob will be happier. People shouldn't judge you by your race and if you feel that they are and it is making you depressed- then find better people to hang out with. It doesn't matter if you are rich or not either- but im not sure if they are really "busy" =(    Also- you parents didn't lose interest in you- they are worried sick about you. They may think that the best thing to do is leave you alone for a while and let u be. Even though it isn't  Please- if this feeling gets worse or keeps coming back please talk to your parents about seeing someone who can help you. Go to a trusted person- or if you feel like you don't have one right now- please talk to your parents- they ARE always there for you.  And believe me- there is always hope..always && forever  If you need to talk more my email is howfarwecome29@yahoo.com  Hope I helped. =D  Nikii|`|5A9UpIJXaa	All is not equal.
THwEPAgiaa	Wow! Yur lucky! only 16 hrs a day! I hav to go for 23!  Well i'm 13 n hav scoliosis too n i've been a wearing my boston brace for nearly 11 months now n it isnt that bad, once u get used to it. I think i'll actually miss it once i hav to stop wearing it! rofl ::)  Dw, it is uncomfy at first but there are so many plusses! U get days of skool for brace appointments, u hav excuses not to participate in any sports u  don't like, if someone tries to punch u in the stomach, they'll get hurt! So to www.spinekids.com for 100 reasons why a brace is AWESOME! Btw, just go to that site anyway, it's really really cool!  Just be warned, NEVER EVER skip breakfast before school unless u want the whole class to hear yur tummy rumbling! Trust me, it was really embarassing! The brace sorta acts like an amplifier n projects even the quietest rumble. :D  30 degrees isnt fantastic, but it isn't that bad really! Mine was 31 degrees when I started with my brace but if u wear the brace properly n never skip, u'll get massive improvements n won't hav to hav surgery! Like me, last brace app, they told me my spine was only 20 degrees!  Email me for me for more info: Tizi_luvs_2_dance@hotmail.com n check out the links below:|`|46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Long, but I hope it helps...    I wore a Wilmington brace from under my arms to just over my hips for 10 mo., then had surgery shortly before I turned 14. My top curve was fused using Harrington rods and bone chips from my hip. I had to go back into a brace about a year after my surgery for 10 mos. more while my bottom curve stabilized. Neither of my braces was too visible. Clothes could easily hide them.    With both braces I had to wear them for 23 hrs./day. You have to have a strong sense of self and not let it mess with your idea of body image. It's clunky and you don't look/feel like everyone else, but keep in mind why you are wearing it. You want to keep your body as healthy as you can and try to correct your back.     Liking your brace...They can be uncomfortable at times. Once you get used to the brace, it's not too bad. But now, some days if I'm feeling a little achy, I miss it. You could be lazy and let the brace do the support work your muscles usually do.    The braces...figure flattering they're not! You'll have to adjust your size. Some braces are larger than others, some more visible than others. You may be able to go up a size or two, but also check out plus size or maternity clothes (some of the same designers for juniors and misses are designing for maternity and plus).  Maternity tends to work better than plus because only your torso is changing shape and not your whole body.  Hey, it's a legitimate reason to go shopping and get a new wardrobe (or at least a lot of new pieces).    I wore loose flowy tops in the warm weather, and sweat shirts and sweaters in the cool. Pants and shorts had to go up a size or you can uses one of those expand a waist button extender things, elastic waists, or draw stings.  I always wore a fitted sleeveless undershirt (A-shirt) under the brace (mens come in packages of 3 and are cheaper than womens) to prevent chafing.     Hot weather in a brace...your brace, curvature, and physician determine how many hours a day you wear your brace. I was only allowed out an hour a day.   -I stayed inside as much as possible (although our AC broke one summer, ugh!). Read, go to movies (it's always freezing in our cinema), the library, shopping, etc.  -On mild days, I laid on the floor in front of an open sliding glass door, the breeze would blow in a little between the brace and my skinspent lots of time reading that way.  -On days I was outside, when I came back in I wiped any skin that was under the brace down with rubbing alcohol to remove the sweaty, grimy feeling (your mom can do your back); wiped down the inside of the brace; and changed into a fresh undershirt.  Keeps you and your brace fresh :)  -I was only allowed out of the brace an hour a day, unless I was in the water swimming. So I swam whenever I could talk my folks into taking me. But you have to be in the water, not just hanging out at the pool.    Good luck!
8dQI7jFVaa	california. new nurses start out at 34.00 a hour. plus bonus shift is 50.00 a hour plus your normal wage and time and a half. big bucks for working O.T.|`|8jr7E8yIaa	yes we all r registered nurses working in different states in usa , canada, uk, australia... i mean world over.  exp. depends on the years we've put in and money depends on diff. factors like country, state, capacity... job....|`|NrfZVM3daa	What an RN makes is all relative.  It depends on the state, area, and facility you work.
QoDacJBgaa	yes.  Sometimes guys who were once outgoing will be very concious about themselves and will be shyer.  The voice is the number one giveaway-- cracking like an egg.  Also, pimples, hormones and all that jazz.|`|IwrS9zw1aa	he'll plop|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Hair growth under the arms etc. usually a growth spurt in size as well.|`|oluB6ClPaa	yes. it's when you grow hair  in places you expect it will be, pimples and the cracking voice.|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	pimples.

AuvMZYTSaa	Uhhhh.....coughing is in no way whatsoever a sign of 'overdosing' on nicotine - that effect causes profuse sweating, dizziness and nausea.    If they are the same size, than cigarettes would have to be worse as they do add chemicals (even extra nicotine) to the filler.  Never heard of Wee Willem cigars, so I really can't comment, but in general, premium cigars would be the better choice of the two - relatively speaking|`|tvt1hSh2aa	They're both bad but cigars are worse because there is no filter.|`|JHfxwDsqaa	Cigars are worse because they have more nicotine. Maybye ur body needed more nicotine than there was in cigarettes|`|geMMyHfpaa	I dont know, I would assume cigars, but I don't mean to state the obvious, but both are not healthy habits.

JzYlcuXzaa	Try Proactive Solution....if not make an appointment with a dermatologist and seek prescription medication.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	question: do you drink a lot of water at all?  if you don't already, start drinking water daily.  ever since i started drinking water (I drink about 2 bottle daily), my skin cleared up pretty well. :D    as a note - sensitive skin, you might benefit from Cetaphil.  But I started using that AFTER my skin cleared up, so I don't know how much of a zit-clearer it is.|`|QCkanmR9aa	proactive best around.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	check out www.acne.org    it has reviews on things that will work and won't work.|`|uHSBIdB1aa	Well what I do is wash my face every night.  After that then you put the cleaning product on.  You can use proactive I hear that works really well.  If it gets to bad go to your skin doctor and they may tell you something you can use that will be better for you skin type.  I hoped I helped!|`|gBSIVZqvaa	i tried many products, and proactive works the best.|`|hYP6akCYaa	proactiv baby it really does work!!!|`|IuGbaLMEaa	just stop eating junk food such as Burger King or Jack in the Box.

I have Kaiser and it wasn't expensive either.|`|birRjksPaa	proactive|`|BaZBWq5Eaa	hmm idk i think clean and clear is the best|`|eNj4bbKBaa	good old fashioned noxzema. actually i have no idea how to spell that. if you are getting them out of no where, it may even be from something you are eating or an allergy. try washing your face with a sensitive wash like cetaphil and warm water, pat it dry and put on a light, sensitive skin moisturizer. repeat for a few days. if that doesn't work, you might have to pull out the big guns like whatever that stuff is that jessica simpson uses. if you are wearing makeup, this may also be a problem. you might try switching your foundation. one that i love (and i have sensitive skin too) is bare minerals. a bit more expensive, but it lasts a long time and is worth the extra cost.|`|qm2NVoTUaa	those clinical products are bad stuff. the secret is get a lime, cut off a slice of rub the lime on your face. the part you cut of. make sure you apply it well. it will eventually dry on your skin, leave it for like 4 hours. after the first use you'll see that half the zits are gone. those clinical companies are trying to get money out of nothing. do this for a week each day. but the end of the second week it will all be gone.    Guaranteed|`|TqYqQgxEaa	well what i use is a neutrogena face wash like the orange bar soap. I use the AVON Solutions(toner, day and night lotions). I had to order it from someone that sell the product. For me it worked well and I also have sensitive skin. The Proactive did not work for me, it made it worse and then I also tried the Neutrogena skiniD and that didnt do it either. Its a trial and error thing so keep trying. Drink lots a lot of water which helps as well...good luck;)|`|Dn8xd0Kuaa	TRY THESE TWO PRODUCTS YOU NEED TO ASK YOUR DERMATOLOGIST.  ONE IS CALLED "BREVOXIL"  AND THE OTHER WHICH ALSO MAKES YOUR SKIN YOUNGER IS CALLED "RETIN-A".    THOSE TWO PRODUCTS REALLY WORK IN DISAPPEARING YOUR ACNE......AND ALWAYS DRINK PLENTY OF WATER.

The rest of the set will make your skill oily, so just get that one tube, it will be gone when you wake up.|`|VZN3rT9Waa	Go see your family doctor and he can prescribe you to a simple cleansing wipe that truly works magic.  I used Clindex, and I love it. Although it kind of dries your skin, it's worth it. Besides, you can always work in an every other day (or only when needed) schedule, to give your skin a rest.  If all else fails, consider talking to your doctor about birth control, preferably one with a higher dose, which should help acne.|`|AA11304359	The first clue to your ZIT ATTACK is your choice of words. . .  you start off your question with OMG!   This shows me that you are stressed out about your complexion.   THIS IS WHAT'S CAUSING THE ZITS.       Calm down about this.  The zits will go away when you stop worrying about it.

I use Meleluca Zap-it You have to special order it from meleluca.com but I would not suggest it for you because it is very acidic but i like it. Also poping them is a very good way to get rid of them, you need to get rid of the puss, some people say it just goes away, well if it really does, that puss goes back into your skin (eww) I just pole a small hole in a zip with a sewing needle.

t2CFnQnDaa	Starvation would work.    Honestly... that's a good weight!    200 calories a day is "virtually" stavation.    You need to eat at least about 1000...  Do some weight lifting instead. Muscle needs more energy to maintain itself, so it will require more calories. Not only that, but you will look much sexier.|`|I2GnFoTLaa	i heard isagenix works but it sounds like a scam...idk. but what your thinking of doing will hurt you. dont do it!|`|novKQ941aa	You can't lose 20 lbs in a month in a healthy manner. eat six small meals a day with protein, veggies and complex carbs. at least 1000 calories is correct.   if you starve your body it will actually slow down your metab and will hold onto extra calories as fat much easier!
73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	Well, I've been working as a page (the person who puts books away) for three years and I'm constantly sniffing the books. Seriously, and haven't been sick very much at all in the past year.    Of course, there is always a risk of breathing in germs but I'd say the inside of the book is fairly safe. It's the covers that are nasty!  Also, adult books are generally less germy than the kids ones. But the kids ones smell the best! It's the paper...|`|P1AfFfP5aa	MEE TOOOOO    and of brand new books :)|`|JQarjZBDaa	yeah its real unhealthy to smell a book uh huh ya... is tht ur hobbie or somthing??|`|hwIMJBVpaa	yeah i like it too...and i have to admit that is very weird. magazine pages smell really good too. i cant really see it being unhealthy...just weird.|`|AA10112346	I doubt it. I mean you'd never know what sick people will do with them..|`|U25RAqyoaa	yeah I would say its fine. Whatever floats your boat.|`|TdCj89Lraa	I love the smell to.  Im sure its not going to kill you.  Libraries will clean books periodically anyway.  So the smell your most likely smelling is the shelf life.|`|dHpyd5OHaa	Well, I don't want to speak for all libraries, but I volunteer in a library regularly, and I know first hand that librarians take excellent care of the books.  But, if you're ever in doubt, you could always go to Barnes & Noble (not to buy, necessarily; )).  It smells amazing in there, too.  :)  Happy reading!
G4p4Mc6waa	maybe cracked it or you have a cavity and something got stuck down in there.  You need to go to the dentist but in the mean time just keep your teeth very clean and avoid sugary and acidic foods until you find the time to go.  Don't put it off for long though it will get worse and more painful.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	omg you need to learn how to brush your dirty teeth!
CqLjZfkLaa	Reducing flinching takes self discipline and nothing more.  Just try your hardest not to do it for a while and before you know it you won't anymore.  It will take some getting used to, but you can do it.

pcmGiwQVaa	Yeah, telling parents can be difficult.  I have felt like I didn't belong much socially either, but got through.  I guess that the trick is trying to find something that you really like and too keep doing it.  Music, TV, or sports can help a lot.  If that doesn't really work for you (which seeing your case it might not), then you should definitely tell your parents to get you a therapist.  I know that you may not want to talk to your parents about your problems, and I guess I never will understand because I never had any problem nearly has severe has this, but they will help even if they are really angry at first.  Honestly, you should just tell one of your parents that seems to be more understanding, and then they will probably help.  Also remember, even if it seems like no one cares, there is some one out there that feels bad for you or will miss you if you go.|`|l7Pi8MVgaa	I went through the exact same thing except I was fifteen when I felt like life was not worth living.  I tried everything to make me happy (even started to be a little bisexual) just so i could hang out with people who understood to be pushed ff to the side.  the sleeping thing i still sleep like 15 hours thats not going away.  Basically what I am trying to say is have some fun and start acting real crazy torwards people I have more friends because of it.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	sites are terrible  they only explain into general terms  as if suicide was a general thing :\    there isnt anything anyone could say on this site to help you at all. i suggest therapist. now. tell your parents you need one. why cant you say that you want a therapist? fiancial issues? talk to the school counsler, if you have one. if you do then they can provide you a professional therapist outside of the school but they would need your parent's permission. if the problem is money then your school would deal with that somehow.    no, you're not only thirteen and no you dont have a lot to live for. unless you make a goal, you really have nothing to live for. as do i, it gets easier as you grow older. i'm 13 too but i've had emotional problems since i was 10. so by now i understand depression and saying things like life sucks or no one notices me is easier to say then ever.    you dont need other people. you can do well with your own self. so do it. dont rely on friends. i once did that and the whole world turned so fragile, one touch and friendships that were suppose to last forever broke in front of your eyes. i think therapists are good because they're basiclly teh only people that would listen to your thoughts and feelings. its not an emotional thing, its more of a fiancial thing. you pay, they listen. but it feels good that you're being cared for and those notes they take, it feels good to be the center of attention, something you've yearned for so long.    suicide is an option, but i'm a whimp so i really cant kill myself. i wish i could. i admire those people that are able to bring a knife to their throats. they are the bravest of us all. but its nothing really to be proud about. if i could be happier i wouldnt have to worry about this at all.    hey you know even sunflowers commit suicide?? once a scientist took sunflowers to the artic and because the sun rose for 24 hours per day in that season every day, the sunflower just followed it around and around and around till it was choking its own stem because it was twisting too tightly. and then they died, chasing after sunlight    i think a lesson can be learned here. chase happieness and you will surely die of depression. if the sunflowers were smart enough to wait for the happieness to come to them, i'm sure they would have lived longer. ksdj    conficence is the key to happiness.  stick your chin out and speak loudly, tell the world you're there. it seems like people like loud and confident people. act like a leader and you will be one, seriously, i tried it. for one day straight i talked with a loud voice. by the next day i found that people actually spoke to me.|`|CBfGXLvKaa	Hugs here are some sites|`|M8kNmWuAaa	im with you man, just look at my name|`|MPtt9wPjaa	you may stop reading this right away after i say  "you're only 13 and you have a lot more to live for"  but thats the fact.. and i dont see why you should wanna deny it at all.. because its a GOOD fact.

Those hours you spend sitting there, ever think to find something good about yourself? like how strong you must be to get through this without anyone.. to still be here and not being stpid like other people who have made stupid decisions like hurting.killing themselves?  so theres one good thing about you right there, and i dont even know who you are! you're a strong person! and if anything, that means you can get out of this.   i;ve had my experience of cutting off the world, trust me, for a loooong time. so let me assure you that it happens. but just you realizing youre alone is a sign that says yo dont wanna be. so dont be! go make new friends, go join a club or sport. start using your time working, and work hard for your grades. the only person it will help in the long run is you.. and whats wrong with helping yourself? if you actively DO something to fix these problems. then youll feel like you have something to live for!   stop thinking so low of yourself, youre a lot stronger than most people.. start with that :) good luckk  you'll be fine.. take care of yourself :)|`|jSjb5DUeaa	i honestly don't know how to answer this because i feel like im in the same situation too. people keep saying i need to be more positive but it never works. i always end up hoping for something that never happens. they say its all in the way you look at things. maybe we just need to continue to hang on to the positive. i dont know. sorry. *hugs*|`|yVzBFIWvaa	I haven't been exactly where you're at, but i've been close. I'm trying to understand, and I think I do. The things that usually help me to feel good are hanging out with somebody (anybody), or listening to some good music. Something that has made me feel better about myself, and just better in general is taking an intrest in my own wellbeing, I've started to take care of my body, and eating healthy has effected my mood greatly, because I feel good, and exercising has helped me not feel so tired and dead. I know the feeling you're talking about. Exercising has also been proven to be a great stress reliever and improve mood. Also, I started to feel better when I began talking to people, starting with my parents, I would eat dinner with them and talk about my day, and their days. I know this would be a lot of change..and what you're going through is hard. I've heard other people say the same things, not exactly, but close. And you do have a purpose in life, and a future, if you choose to. As long as you're here, why not enjoy yourself? That's the way I see it. I've gone through my fair share of hard times, in the past few years, both my grandmothers, my great aunt, my dad, and my best friend have all passed away. Don't let your time slip by like I did. Get back into the world, it's not so bad. Well certain aspects. I don't know if people have said anything to you, but people used to be real jerks to me, not for any reason, just because they were the "popular" kids (that nobody actually likes), anyways, i don't know if that's happening to you, but don't let it get to you if it is, because they aren't worth it. I really do hope you feel better. And here's a song that may or may not help you, it's about sucky things happening, but having the mindset that everything's gonna be alright anyways. It's called "Lucky Today" by Cloud Cult (it might be one word) p.s. sorry this was so freakin long. email me if you want-williamsdquest@yahoo.com  :D  Keep your chin up.  If you can't think of the good things, think about what bad things you don't have, if that makes sense. I've witnessed extreme poverty first hand...just think about the simple little things..
hSOEgpPNaa	You are in a stale.  You have to break through it.  Try different things, supersets, high reps, low reps with heavy weight, etc.  You might want to lay off for a week or two.|`|lyWX8MpJaa	Almost everybody has came to this point in their lifting. This is what is commonly called a plateau. It can be hard to get beyond this plateau, but what you basically have to do is switch your work-out up. What happened was your body got used to the exercises you have been doing and has adapted. What you need to do is do something called muscle confusion. Switch up by doing different exercises than you were doing before and you should get over this plateau.|`|ZqCWi4XLaa	Here is what you do, i learned this trick from a professional body builder. When you hit a plateau simply reduce the amount of weight and sets you do for about three weeks. You will feel like three weeks of no progress would seem like a waste of time but during these three weeks where you gradually reduce weight and sets on your routine your body is thrown off by this sudden reduce in stress. As a result it will start to pack on more muscle because the body is forced to adapt to this changing environment. The reason why you hit a plateau in the first place is because every week you gradually added weights to your routine and eventually your body caught on and eventually it has adapted to the condition and will no longer feel the threat to add on more muscle and strength. When you decrease the weights all a sudden the stress level decreases which will allow your muscles to add on more muscle. After about three weeks of gradually decreasing weights and sets your body will start to catch on and you will once reach another plateau but this is when you go back to increasing the weights and you will be able to lift more than you were before. This technique manipulates your body into adding on muscle by tricking it constantly. Just keep doing this cycle every three weeks, it will prevent you from ever hitting another plateau.|`|lwnH4Es3aa	its called plateauing- change your bicep workout drastically to breakout of it-i dont know how many reps n hw heavy you are going so you can do a workout with light weight like 12 -5 reps or really heavy weight that like 2-5 reps. it will also help 2 do diff exercises n change the order this will help prevent a plateau  Good luck!|`|t2CFnQnDaa	Well, first of all, if you are just doing arms and nothing else, that wouldn't suprise me. Your body has to build overall before you continue. If that is the case, then you will notice that after building the rest of your body, you will be able to boost in curls.|`|ICLekd2Vaa	you didnt buy the complete set of weights from the store, did you??? ;)|`|mqXyDTwwaa	It's hard to tell with the limited information you gave. But usually it's because you're overtraining. Try cutting your biceps workouts to twice a week until you start making progress again. Seriously, it works. I work each body part twice a week, and I make great progress. Oh, and muscle confusion is a crock of sh!t. Muscles don't think. They can't get confused.
0zpWVq0Iaa	I am really really sorry to hear this.!  I hope thigns get better.!  What might be the problem is that someone stole his phone,  or make he is drunk and he will be better by tomorrow,  im sure everything will be fine,  he mgiht jsut be going through denial sense marriage is a big thing to go into.!  Just calm down,  take a nap,  or do somethign to relax,  stop calling it will make it worse,  just try calling him tomorrow,    FYI be careful, this might lead to an abusive relationship|`|nGVeXUpNaa	Your 14 and he's your fiance?? Why would you want to marry a jerk like that?  I think you should just wait until you see him face to face, and if hes still being a jerk, dump his ***.|`|Mj0BA4Yvaa	...and you're asking Yahoo Answers for help?  Don't you have, oh I don't know, friends or family to talk to about this?  Also, he's your finance at 15?  I don't think so.  My advice: get good grades in school and focus on college and your career.|`|zfm51Rpyaa	there isnt much you can do. If hes cheating on you then you could do so much better. And why is he your fiance? You two are way too young to think that your love is gonna carry. He is young and naive and isnt ready for commitment in a relationship rather a marriage. But usually some guys go through phases where they can be an a55hole one minute and then be sweet and want you back. If your really crazy about him just be kind to him and hopefully he'll snap out of it. If he continues make yourself hard to get and make him chase you and want you back. make him miss you by not showing love for him and not caring. Im sure he'll change a bit. If not then you need to reconsider him cuz he isnt the right person for you.|`|AJi9N6K9aa	He is 15 years old. All he knows is that he likes girls, likes to be around girls, and likes to have sex or try to have sex with girls. Ask anyone in their mid 20's and they'll tell you that you'll pretty much become an entirely differently person 10 years from now. You have every right to be pissed off and sad, and if you leave him the sadness will only last a few weeks or months. But it'll take 15-20 years for this guy to mature!!! Look it up - guys dont truly want to settle down till their mid to late 30's. Seriously, dont get married to this guy, you're too young to settle down already! You  need to date tons of guys and learn what kinds traits you like about somebody and what you dont like. I know this probably sounds like crap to you, but I'm only 24 and I've been where you are, and I am totally different from the way I used to be. I probably wouldnt listen to me at your age either, but I swear, you'll get over this and have tons of fun meeting new, mature, sweet guys over the next few years.|`|yC7hgBfGaa	computer|`|AA11284138	Listen what I am going to say. Shut up. Boy you teens are stupid. Get your self together, you are 14, "fiance" give me a break.

Your not married are you?  Or is that just short for boyfriend..  Well he seems like an asshole you dont need a boy to complete  your wonderful gift of life.  Just live life as it comes, nothings perfect.  Plenty of fish in the sea, just keep your chin up  and remind yourself he's not worth your tears.  |`|WmM3XeLPaa	If he was devoted to you before, he is probably messing around with his friends. He was too cowardly to break up with you if he really hates you. That means he still has FEELINGS for you.    Go to his house if you can. Talk to his friends and see where he is or why he isn't answering. If you're upset, just lay in your room and listen to some music. You're still going out with him, so try not to worry. He's going to feel really bad about it at the end of this ordeal.    Please be strong and don't get upset. You can fight through it. Woah woah woah, go back here. You're 14, he's fifteen. He's your FIANCE?   First, you need to get the story straight. There are better people out there.     It might take a while, but you'll be ok. There is always an ending.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	Here a good one. I'm serious. Don't call him at all. He will chase you. When you finally let him talk to you tell him he has to explain what he said and did that night. Be cool about this. The cooler the better.|`|2xycmzW5aa	Your only 14.|`|4M9yVsxvaa	Talk to him about it when you see him. And you are 14 so you shouldn't have to really worry about it.|`|LSrxN4Qnaa	he is your FIANCE and hes 15 and youre 14? good choice putting this question under the mental health section|`|uwCcIY8Aaa	i'm sorry honey. i know how it feels. it sucks. but.. i honestly think that he's just another stupid immature boy. and i know you don't wanna hear that but i've been through it three times now. boys just don't fall in love at that age like we do. just try to let it go for now and next time you see him talk to him about it. just vent about it to your friends and they'll help get it off your mind okay? (: feel better sweetie!|`|YPVLgV3baa	ok ok ok ok ok ok ok...chill  I'm 13 btw..  anyways,well he honestly might be drunk...I'd leave him alone for awhile..  and TRUST ME...i know how it is when your in love ya know and that persons really a total asshole and you dont understand til afterwards..  but maybe hes just trying to show of or hes drunk or hes high or hes just being an asshole.  just dont keep calling him over and over because he will opnly get more pissed off i promise you that,just try to stay calm and if hes an asshole then just dont talk to him.    I really hope that helps...(((((((((((((:|`|T6nmD3X9aa	Trust me, you did not lose your everything. You will have so many boys you are interested in over the next few years and most will make this guy look like the biggest loser. You really do not want this guy, you need someone who can treat you with respect (you will learn this as you get older, I hope). You do not want to get in the habit of being in relationships like this, they are unhealthy and only lead to more problems.     Learn from this, move on and enjoy your childhood.   Goood luck to you|`|OfPSBAu5aa	You're 14??? and has a fiance???    You haven't even experienced "everything" how can you say you lost everything? Dump him and move on before he dump you.    Don't get depressed yet, you haven't experience what life is...|`|60ApQsGOaa	Until you can watch your "fiance" take a dump in the toilet and be  okay with it, then you don't know what love REALLY is. But being compassionate for a minute, no one can tell you anything you aren't ready to hear. I was that age too. I was that age and I didn't want to hear "you aren't in love" or "thats not what love is". but when you experience it for yourself then you'll know what everyone has been saying all along. The thing is, he isn't your everything because he isn't a MAN. a MAN wouldn't be a little puss and laugh with his buddies when his girlfriend is crying. a MAN wouldn't hang up on you. Those are all things a boy does. And until you grow older, and meet older people (that is when you yourself get older and more experienced with life), you'll realize that even men that are 23 are still acting like they are 16. Just don't base every male on this one "child". Cuz that's all he is. a Child. You need to focus on what you wanna do when you get to college and whats going to make your life better...he's aparently not. And yeah its all "heard that before", but i've SERIOUSLY been there. Just take my word and trust me on it. He's not the end of the world girl!|`|AA10204532	chill out! maybe his friend got hos phone and messing with u? and u r going for it!! u r 14 and he is 15, and he is ur fiance?|`|b6356b9558163864dfaed163316ee3b1aa	Your finance ? You are teenagers. I am not telling you to get over him because I know thats impossible at this point. But atleast pretend to move on, and if he goes after you, then thats great. If not, he is not worth your time. Have more respect for yourself.. trust me, PLEASE trust me.|`|ZqhaMRFqaa	leave him   he is  cheating  yyou have your whole life ahead of you|`|WZeUrVXFaa	get a life, ur 14... you might have more chances, but you sound extra loco to me... maybe you deserve him...|`|rVRcMakVaa	You are way too young to be acting like this or being like that in a relationship, live a little.|`|nFlaPmnTaa	wait it out  if he isn't answering than there is something going on  whether his phone is dead or if he's ignoring you  either way only time will tell    and you have to ask yourself do you want to spend the rest of your life with this person?  if so than trust that he will come back to you
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	If you could stand to lose some weight, doing that might reduce the size of your breasts because they include lots of fat.

If you are on the high side, consider losing weight by sensible eating and exercise.     Breasts are largely made of fat tissue and  respond well to weight loss.   If being overweight is not the issue, surgery is really your only option.     Be careful and research any surgeon well. There are risks such as complications, infection, loss of sensation. On the up side, it will make your life easier and help your back. This is more important than the guys being happy that you are big.    Best wishes in your decision.|`|3Sm1qQ1Taa	breast reduction|`|5jpOHgwaaa	why would you want to do that?|`|bBQEOeGSaa	wear a really tight bra     i do that!|`|HtOTdQHUaa	the best way i think is to lose weight, becuz i heard dat breast reductions reduces orgasims
FupqCfK0aa	You can change your weight by changing around your food choices (instead of chips, go for a piece of toast and an apple). Although changing your calorie intake can help you loose some weight short term, the best way to maintain a healthy weight is to do BOTH.     You don't need to go to a gym to work out! Here is what I do when I can't hit the gym:  -Take the steps (2 at a time) whenever I can, and when I have a block of time I go up and down for ten minutes. If you do this twice a day you have 20 minutes of cardio.    - Walking is said to be the best exercise in the world. Take a brisk walk around the block. It makes a big difference!    You will change your appearance by making healthier food choice, but I truly believe that the best way to shred pounds is to balance both. Plus- if you exercise and you want a cookie - eat it!|`|dkoGI9nfaa	Yes you can.  I did it.  I believe reducing your calorie intake sensibly is the real way.  Exercise accelerates the process.  the key in weight loss is diet.  It is diet that will keep it off as well.  Exercise is a good substitute if you find it too hard to stick to your eating regime.  Go for it.|`|lyWX8MpJaa	This is how bad some habits can be.  Stop drinking soft drinks and you will instantly lose weight.  Eat more vegetables and fruits and stop eating so much junk food and you will instantly lose weight.  Diet is a big part of gaining weight or losing weight.  Cardio is more like a supplement to a diet. Cardio can help you lose calories of course, but if your diet is still bad it WILL NOT help.|`|ZqCWi4XLaa	As a health and fitness expert I can easily answer your question. While it is true that you can lose weight by just diet alone it is better and far more effective if you can combine the two. Since you don't have time for the gym I can give you this tip on your diet that will have you losing 1-2 pounds a week if you work really hard and commit to it. Tomorrow i want you to record how many calories you ate and then subtract 250 from that total. Do this every two weeks until you are the size you want. Aside from this you should eat 5-6 times a day. These 5-6 meals should be fairly small and make sure you are drinking ice water with these meals because they will control your apatite and increase your metabolism. When you wake up you must eat right away. The longer you wait, the more fat your body will store when you eat. By eating 5-6 meals that are spaced out about 3 hours you are speeding up your metabolism which will force your body to burn off fat. Make sure that these meals are healthy. You can't just eat 5-6 meals that consist of ice cream, pizza, chips, etc.|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Eating healthy and only as much as  your body needs will remove fat tissue and allow you to lose weight.  Your body also needs exercise to keep it strong and healthy.  For many people the only exercise they do is get up in the morning, go to work, come home and sleep.  Walking is a good exercise, builds stamina and will benefit strength and mobility.|`|I2GnFoTLaa	try and see...idk|`|Ou64wRvJaa	Reduce calorie income by avoiding sugary junk food as well as all others within a couple weeks you may lose 5 lbs. naturally and in a healthy manner.You may lose more if you walked for 15 minutes every day. I took up a sport and lost weight and replaced it with muscle.|`|AA10420446	Yes changing what you eat helps out a allot. diets don't work. You body needs food. Cheese burgers and large fries are not Good food. Find a balance on what your body burns and what you eat. Going to the gym will increase the amount of calories your body burns. But a simple walk everyday running a mile and walking a mile burn the same calories. Eat smarter there are lots of low calories tasty food recipes online. Food Network has tons. Good luck..

geMMyHfpaa	Use this motto: Tomorrow is a new day. Anyone can start anew including you. Don't worry about your dad, just yourself. Put all your effort into your school. Trust me, if you do well in school, and im not even kidding, your life will be that less stressful. If theres someone you don't like break up with him. Don't stress yourself on pleasing him, your not his servent. If you don't like your job, find something pleasent to do. Depending on were you work, you can bulid friendships with co-workers, or practice your social skills with customers. Just find enjoyment out of little things in your life|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	i dont know  some people are amazing at organizing and balancing everything, others are not. i'm one of the others, and i do have days when i'm so stressed out i would start punching stuff    one good way to stop stressing is to exercise. i found out that if i'm tired then i cant be stressed out. but that could lead into sleeping when you're doing your hw.    try listening to music. classical is eh, rock or heavy metal is too distracting. i like to listen to jack johnson or the beatles or even led zep if i dont have too much hw. but stick to the bands that have a bit of a softer side to it, something you can listen to but dont have to pay attention to. like you wouldnt tap your foot while listening to it.    i found that music is the most effective of them all, since i dont have much time to run around and jump freely.
AA10718475	The prevalence of active epilepsy is roughly in the range 510 per 1000 people. Up to 5% of people experience non febrile seizures at some point in life; epilepsy's lifetime prevalence is relatively high because most patients either stop having seizures or (less commonly) die of it. Epilepsy's approximate annual incidence rate is 4070 per 100,000 in industrialized countries and 100190 per 100,000 in resource-poor countries; socioeconomically deprived people are at higher risk. In industrialized countries the incidence rate decreased in children but increased among the elderly during the three decades prior to 2003, for reasons not fully understood.|`|GAHFiIqSaa	If his epilepsy is idiopathic than it most likely cause by a spirit, as believed in antiquity. Aura symptoms prior to a seizure further supports a spiritual cause. Any type of tingling on the skin is the feeling of the causative spirit.    If a spirit is the cause, know that it is a good one, as it is acting to save your husband's soul. This is a very complex situation beyond this answer. Complete relief from seizures may come about through a realization that a spirit is the cause.
K8qMighsaa	i dont think your father had dka (diabetic ketoacidosis), i had dka twice in a short time. my sugars werent too high at onset, more like in the mid 300s the first time, mid 200s the second time. which yeah is bad, but does not put me in IMMEDIATE danger, until i started spilling ketones in my urine. ketones = when your body stops burning sugar for energy and starts burning fat, that dehydrates you FAST, makes you very very sick, you throw your cookies up and theres no relief, the barf just keeps coming. i was in icu twice b/c of it. and yes, you can go from being type 2 to being type 1. they might be 2 different things, but people w/ type 2 whose insulin is ineffective can become type 1 eventually. type 1 just means your body doesnt produce insulin (to make a long complicated story short, more comlex than that, but leave it at that for now). so yeah, you can easily go from having impotent insulin to not producing it at all, especially if you dont maintain tight control. thats precisely what happened to my grandfather, he was type 2 and slipped into lifetime type 1 cause back in the day, they didnt have the technology we have now. if his reading was in the 600s, im surprised he slipped into a coma, cause normally people dont slip into a diabetic coma till their readings are like in the 900s, but then again, i had dka w/ a reading of 240, so anything is possible! and of course he had hallucinations, w/ such high glucose levels, it plays w/ your mind (the nervous system become compromised). and no, there are some things hell never fully recover from, especially if he hasnt been taking good care of himself for a while now, like his nerves will probably be damaged permanently. he might seemingly start to feel better once they get his gluocose levels to normal, but in the aftermath, he will probably suffer from peripheral nerve damage, lose sensation in his hands and feet, or worse yet, his hands and feet will tingle, burn, hurt, etc. before the nerve dies and finally theyll go numb. also, hows his vision? cause the eyes have such tiny arteries running through them they start to bleed when deprived of oxygen (blood flow). and hell lose his sight, or hell at best get blurry white spots he wont be able to see past. (like me) its called retinopathy, by the way. he might even feel a burning on his skin, like on his thighs and chest, like sunburn, or hell feel like hes sitting in an oven, that too is nerve damage, i experienced it a couple weeks AFTER i got home from the hospital. took about a yr to stabilize, but i still get it off and on. he might lose a kidney, might have to go on dialysis or get a transplant, depending on how long it took them to get him out of the coma. put it to you this way, he might be out of immediate danger, but the complications will be a constant reminder. from now on, he HAS to take his shots and check his sugars several times a day, before and after meals, and maintain the tightest of control, no ifs ands or buts! he cant eat more than 3 meals a day, and a small snack, and limit his meals to 30 GOOD carbs per meal, no more than 100 grams of GOOD carbs a day, and forget about the BAD carbs (cookies, soda, ice cream, white bread, etc). plus, hes gonna be edgy when his sugars are out of control (high one minute, low the next) so watch for that. make sure hes taking the right amount of insulin w/ his meals, cause the one side effect of insulin is possible hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and w/ a reading lower than 70, you can slip into a coma FAST too, if not faster than a reading of 900! he needs to always carry a snack w/ him wherever he goes while on insulin, b/c you never know when his sugars will plummet. all it takes is 16 grams of carbs to return his sugars back to normal when too low, but give it time. it might take anywhere from 20-60 mins to recover from hypoglycemia! get him to see a nutritionist and take him to diabetic classes! he cant take this disorder for granted. its a life sentence, and one slip up can spell major trouble, if not death! best of luck.|`|AA10003191	Hopefully he will.    That high a blood sugar is life threatening. He'll be in the hospital for a while, as they try to figure out WHY it went so high. They'll run tests adjust his meds, and keep his sugars as close to normal as possible.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	That level of blood glucose interferes with the normal metabolism and creates an acidosis in the blood which effects every organ including the brain which is why he went into a coma. The sooner they can get him out of it the better sign that is. But there should be no fooling around with his blood sugar readings every day and monitoring his meals. Do everything the docs tell you. Write it down and there are support groups associated with almost any hospitals. Or there's usually at least one RN who does diabetic teaching. Call him/her.|`|9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	Hi Honey! Your dad has DKA diabetic ketoacidosis. It is life threatening. I am glad he is getting medical care.   But, You do not go from a Type 2 to a Type 1 as they are not the same disease. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that kills the B cells in your pancreas, type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder where your body does not use insulin efficiently. He can be a type 2 and need insulin though. It is important that you and your dad know more about the different kinds of diabetes and I urge you both to ask for a diabetes educator to work with you on the issues that you now face.    Both types of diabetes can cause changes in your mental state and depression as a result of fluctuating glucose levels.    Please read:  Diabetic Ketoacidosis Overview    Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a state of inadequate insulin levels resulting in high blood sugar and accumulation of organic acids and ketones in the blood. It is also common in DKA to have severe dehydration and significant alterations of the bodys blood chemistry.    DKA is usually seen in people who have type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes. Most often, these are diabetics younger than 25 years, but the condition may occur in diabetics of any age. Males and females are equally affected.     Please go to:  http://www.emedicinehealth.com/diabetic_...    Don't over worry, but your dad needs to get his diabetes under control. If he uses needles for his insulin, he may benefit from an insulin pump.    Please see: http://www.minimed.com/    Your family is in our prayers...Take care.|`|plwuZ0Kuaa	a friend of mine had diabetes for over 15 years taking 3-4 shots a day. His levels went that high and he too went into acoma. He did come out of it and this time he did something about it.    He got on the Ultimate Plus Program, Core Complex and Nite Works and herbalifeline in 45 days his doctor took him off insulin and today he has been unsulin free for over 149 days. Plus he lost alot of weight , has energy now and feels Great.  Here is a link to check it out www.healthshop4you.com|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	When you have diabetes, your body does not use the sugar/energy from the blood normally.  In a healthy person, you eat and digest and the energy/nutrients go into your blood and feed all the cells in your body.  With diabetes, the sugar stays in the blood and doesn't go into the cells normally.  Your father's sugar was high.  Normal is under 120, actually like 70-100.  Was he taking insulin before this or any medication?  It is very hard for some people to control their diabetes.  Going into a coma for any reason can cause permanent changes, but hopefully it won't for your father.  You should read up on diabetes and diet so you won't have these problems as you age.  Exercise, eating extra fiber and a sensible diet will help keep you healthy.  The more you know, the more you can encourage your father to take care of himself.
kGsRFXRhaa	it could be any number of things. I won't list them all because they will just freak you out for no reason but i will say this. Can you suck in your stomach? does it hurt when you do? I had an ovarian cyst about 4 months ago and those symptoms sound the same as mine. I actually had people ask we if i was pregnant because my stomach was so disproportionately huge. Also, does it hurt when you push on your abdomen area? That was another symptom i had. If you are having any weird bowel movements or lack of bowel movements you could just need a laxative. I might try the laxative... and if it doesn't resolve with that, call your doctor :)|`|9da334de0d8258350046544850e0fa57aa	maybe you need your colon or insides cleansed...whateva they call it no, you can just get some regular inside cleansers from the pharmacy area in any store i believe.

OuYPy2Ihaa	If it is high, it is pumping blood on adrenaline only, which is not good. Blood pressure is elevated, which can damage arteries.    When you exercise, blood is circulated to the muscles and the oxygen extracted by the working muscles.  In addition, chemicals are  released during exercise that help blood vessels relax which helps them stretch and avoid damage.    I'm not sure you should run, but you can go for a walk, or walk on the treadmill, and hopefully it will help.|`|IzHfbWtiaa	No program of exercise should be started without the advice of a Dr,especially if your Heart rate is to high! Bottom line,consult a Dr. God Bless!|`|ROPFKW2Jaa	exercise make your heart rate higher. Don't do it during anxiety.  You need to calm down with relaxation.
ilEXmjJgaa	I dont think so, if he is still in time he can get the shots to prevent rabies manifestation NOW if he already has the rabies in a stage beyond what the shots can make most people will tell you he is screwed but HE IS NOT, there is actually a not very common but yet existant cure to the manifested rabies, this procedure works by inducing the victim into a comma, most rabies are in the nervious system so by inducing the comma you shut down the system preventing the desease from killimg you and giving the body system the required conditions to attack the virus and thus survive.|`|huNpyxV7aa	i dont think he will die?|`|AA10453678	as long as he goes through the proper treatment he'll be fine. good luck|`|5UWQmEm8aa	He will have a brief time period to get the neccesary shots.  if it goes untreated for two long he will die.|`|BGKjKfINaa	he will be wild eyed and frothing at the mouth by the next full moon|`|DoHaUEziaa	No, your brother will not die from rabies. If he was bitten by an animal that was rabid then he would have to get treated right away. I'm guessing if you don't know yet then the animal is in quarantine or was put down to determine if it has/had rabies. Don't worry, he will not die. Good luck kiddo.
WoqKWkQaaa	whoa there, calm down.  take a breath, and be in control.  yes there is stress, but you can do something about this.  very sorry about the loss; she'd want you to not be stressed though!  first off, you REALLY need some more sleep.  relax before sleeping (reading a long boring book).  maybe you could try to establish a sleeping pattern that you could stick to.  if you sleep well, it'll honestly make your day 10x better.  if you feel like bursting out, just know that you will hurt others with your words, and if you know that you are starting to shout, leave the room and find something to do until you are calm enough to not go ballistic.  if you still can't calm yourself, just talk to your fiancee, of course she would listen to every word you say.  best of luck.|`|baSks9O4aa	You need sleep. I turn into a maniac if I don't get enough sleep. Get as much as possible.|`|cc09cedaebf78cf81eee61de372a98bdaa	Maybe you need a little break. Take a mini vacation or a sick day and just contemplate life for a bit. And get more sleep.     A therapist sounds extreme but it can be really helpful just to talk everything out... your fiancee could even help with that. Just talk to her about things.    Another idea is to join a crazy class, or take up a sport or physical activity. It's a great way to channel negative energy into fun stuff!     I hope you find balance because with twins I can't see your life getting much more relaxed anytime soon. Not necessarily a bad thing, but be prepared to be busy. That's why its important to find an outlet for this stress and not yell at your fiancee. I'm sure all she wants right now is lots of love and you two could benefit from time alone together in a mini vacation day.    Good luck with everything, and congratulations :]|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	It sounds like you need to talk to your doctor.  Your stress level is way to high and it is very understandable.  But you need to find help.  Maybe there is a vitamin that you can take like St. John Wart (after being ok'ed by your dr of course) or even excercise is an excellent stress reducer.  My husband loves to take Tae Kwon Do  (sp?) when he is stressed.  He takes stress out on all the broken boards and it helps.  Mainly, talk to your doctor.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	You answered your own question as to why. Now what you need is a support system. Is there anyone that can help you with some of your responsibilities? Figure out what you want your fiance to do then tell her. If she doesn't know she can't help you.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.     The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people.

There are many reasons this might happen, not all related to the eye itself.|`|PauslbY0aa	20/22 never heard of that.. actually its not as good as 20/20.  please DONT wear sunglasses driving :)    you probably should get examined again, if you get glasses, an anti reflective treatment could work find for you. it basically makes it as if you arent wearing glasses, it wont help much with glare from the windshield (unless you could treat the windshield somehow), but it will help with any from your lenses.|`|TEhdnSdhaa	Do you have eye Insurance if not here is a program you get and get any glasses you need for less call the ask before you do anything   here is a link  http://www.mybenefitsplus.com/zulu|`|dtYIv4lYaa	Are you having a problem looking at road signs such as doubled?

3keMgQCZaa	You do know, of course, that your body secretes different things...like sweat, urine, vaginal discharge, etc...    Did you know that whatever you consume depends on the scent and taste of your genitals?    Well it does.    The foods you eat have acidic content that change both the taste and smell. Onions can actually change the taste within just a day of eating them, as well as spicy foods. Asparagus is the worst. And still,other things can cause an unpleasant smell, like drinking hard alcohol and smoking. Also, dairy products can cause a foul taste. Keep that in mind.    This same thing happens to guys too. What they eat/drink is secreted through their semen, and can cause odor.      Eating certain nutritious foods has been known to improve both the smell and taste of vaginal/seminal secretions. Fruits can actually sweeten the taste, as well as fruit juices (orange juice, pineapple juice, etc.) Also, plain organic yogurt can help.    However, don't be all self-concious about the smell. It's unlikely that anyon else will be able to smell it. And as long as your genitals are healthy, you're good to go. Also, don't change your diet completely--eat what you want, you just have to lower the intake of some odor-causing foods.    So, you can continue eating onions, but just cut back on them a little.        Hope this helps...

The fact that it is in the crotch is because this chemicals that is not broken down is produced out of the body through the sweat.

Common problem dear, Do not worry. It is a part of the woman physiology to secrete out hormones from the vagina. When you eat onions, there is a hyper active hormone aassociated which flows in all directions in your body after digestion. This hormone occupies a greater part of inner fluids which are secreted out, hence the smell from your vagina for more than one day is not abnormal. What you can do to avoid this is,      After you have eaten onion, walk for half an hour, then drink a glass full of water which has half a lime added to it. The more onion you eat, the more lime water you'd have to drink. :)|`|M0Cg6Kyhaa	I agree with green_da -       and I suggest taking baths rather than showers.  Use a douche once a week or so, not too much though, it is not good for you to do too often and make sure you don't use a harsh soap, use something gentle that smells good and don't wear pants that are too tight, all these things will help.  That area needs to "breathe", so to speak.      And not to be mean at all, please don't call it your "crotch", that sounds so masculine.  Just not very girly at all.

0Z2aBH0Daa	They come in several forms at Whole Foods Market, do you have one near you? If not, order it online.    They come dried/unsweetened in the nuts section, but they taste awful like that...    They come frozen/ready for a smoothie in little packets:  The staff people will probably not even know where they are...if they can't find them then ask for the manager of that dept., he/she will definitely know.     They come in drink form but the taste can be really NOT good...and is VERY expensive.    So, I recommend the frozen kind and making it into a smoothie, add some nonfat yogurt and some frozen or fresh fruit and blend it up. Really good for you. Don't get sucked into the 2 oz a day acai juice habit where you have to mail order it/auto delivery, it's a scam!    BTW it's pronounced "Asahi." Good luck!|`|oTkYuxM2aa	i get them at flea markets and hispanic grocery stores. theyre sold frozen and canned at grocery stores. it's pronounced "asss-eye" asahi is a japanese beer|`|NPzDQmlQaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.      Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.      First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...    This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.    However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.      Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|ekirK7ZAaa	Just a quick note, you can get acai berries anywhere. However you must be careful with online scammers!   There are many BBB complains regarding these companies, I would suggest you get the berreies from a reliable source...    Good Luck.|`|GXiCrhVYaa	With the exception of one company, my personal advice is to avoid acai products.     Due to my own misfortune, I am on a personal mission to warn people about acai SCAMS. One scam is Acai Berry Supreme. They promised me a free bottle and I would only have to pay shipping. I noticed an additional $29.95 added to my credit card from that company and had to complain to the company to get a refund. Then they started shipping me more bottles and trying to charge me for them.    Another scam is Acai Berry Power 500, which also offered a free trial bottle. They then started mailing me additional bottles of acai without my permission. Again, I had to complain to the company to get credit card charges removed.    Also beware of people trying to sell you acai products on YA. Be cautious about people warning you of scams and then directing you to their website to buy their acai products.    If you are still interested in acai, your best bet is to go to almost any health food or vitamin store and buy acai directly. I have NO financial ties to Sambazon, but they are the most well-known and reputable companies selling acai.     Acai is NOT a weight loss product !!     I cannot offer you any guarantees, but what helped me lose about 20 pounds in 3 months is an old, very inexpensive natural remedy that might sound strange to you. Put 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar (ACV) and 1 tablespoon of honey in 8 ounces of warm water and drink this mixture. Do this twice a day (even more if you want to) . It may take a while to get used to the taste. If you really dont like the taste, add extra honey.     Use Bragg's ACV or other brands from a health food store, not stuff you buy in a regular grocery store. Also avoid the ACV capsules sold in grocery stories and drug stores. They are a waste of money. As I said, the ACV did work for me. For the 3 to 4 weeks, I don't think I lost an ounce, but maybe my metabolism was speeding up. In the second and third month, the weight started to come off.     ACV has been used for hundreds of years for a variety of health issues, so this is not the latest fad diet. If you want more info, google apple cider vinegar weight loss.|`|AwicI0VJaa	there are a lot of free trails you can find online if you google it or you can get it at GNC|`|V90Ao2jfaa	I don't know if they shipped the berries yet but you can get the drink everywhere. have you tried whole foods market?

HiSVA9p8aa	In the past I have experienced bouts of depression and, at times, had thoughts of suicide.    What always stopped me was the idea that someone I loved would have to find my body or clean up a mess or deal with the knowledge that I had done this terrible thing.  That was always enough to make the thoughts go away.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	yes, most people. but some just think of the people that they would hurt if they commited suicide and decide not to do it.|`|bb613GVgaa	Why dont you ask them and find out?      ...how is anyone supposed to know that?|`|jg9w6IbQaa	i know that if someone i loved committed suicide i wouldn't be able to handle it. obviously i would be extremely upset and i  know couldn't deal with that.     that's why i could never bring myself to commit suicide. because if there are people out there that actually care that much about me, i don't have the heart to put them through all of that mental and emotional pain due to something i did. i understand that i would be dead so it wouldn't matter, but for me, the thought of doing that to someone just kills me.|`|AA11966419	Maybe. I think that some people don't do it for their friends and family, or faith, fear of the possibility of an afterlife or the absence of existence, or fear they could mess it up and must live through it.

It seems fairly ironic that someone would be cowardly enough to take their own life, yet too coward to even follow through with the act.|`|kt2i6eKXaa	there's always an easier way to do it without virtually feeling any pain. but i don't think what you said is the only reason why some people don't commit suicide. maybe they don't have the guts for it, or maybe they think that they have something to live for. idk. a psychologist might know better.|`|EnsCObafaa	I think if someone really wanted to end their life badly enough, they'd do it no matter what because the emotional pain to them is usually worse than any physical pain they'd have to endure. I think most people are considering the result, which would be an end to all their pain completely. There are ways that people choose to commit suicide that do not involve pain.  If a person decides not to commit suicide because of the pain, then clearly they do not wish to truly end their life.|`|AA10065077	People back out of suicide for various reasons. One of them is what you mentioned. They don't want to go through the pain of whatever method they have chosen for the suicide. Some people think of those that they would hurt if they killed them self. Some think of what would happen if they didn't succeed

A bad diet can hurt growth though, so if you didnt eat a balanced diet when you were younger that could be a reason. 5'7" isnt a bad height. Tom Cruise got a lot of girls back in the day, and Zac Efron gets alot now, height cant hold you back.
ox7mJ2Psaa	here is how it works: you and a trainer skilled in body building ( who doesn't try to sell supplements or other stuff you don't need ) will help you design a work out routine. i have been around guys who were serious about body building. they usually do (legs 1st day) (back and shoulders 2nd day) and (chest and arms the third day). the guy i knew ate 8 - 10 times a day but he had been doing this for years and he was huge with no body fat. he ate lots fruit, tuna, and hit the all you can eat salad bar two times a day like a hurricane. 2 or 3 plates full then filled a gym bag with apples, bananas and anything else he could get. being a girl you wont be able to build an upper body like my friend but you can build the legs and butt really huge if you did all the weighted squats, lunges, presses and other things he did. the diet builds gradually so don't just stuff yourself thinking it's all building muscle. the same rules apply take in too many calories you end up strong but fat. understand? he also stayed away from aerobic work outs he said it burned off muscle mass. he ran once a week for a few miles and that was it. (unless you count sex ) he was a dog and dumb girls were always giving it up for him. he was doing 4 or 5 sets of each exersise and almost lived at the gym with each work out around two hours. he would go several times a day for a week or two before a compition and just burn himself out / build himself up. he sleep a lot also to heal all the tearing that takes place building muscle. i never got into it like him i don't like being a slave to the gym.|`|61KgH2z5aa	I think it depends on your body type, metabolism, genetics, diet, physical and mental activity, and emotional state, so its not possible to give you a silver bullet answer with just the information you provided.    In my experience, eating a lot of protein was disastrous for my health, not to mention helped me to LOSE weight.  If you eat any meat at all in a day, you are probably getting enough protein for the week.    Instead just concentrate on eating more in general, exercising till you are fatigued and burning fat, and drink lots and lots of water.  Don't forget, most of muscle composition is water.  You will be a toned lean fighting machine!|`|NW0wmbBqaa	First of all eating protein and everything will help but you should still eat other things like breads and carbohydrates. Also work all your muscles otherwise it will not be good for your body. And if you work your biceps make sure you work triceps also.|`|9D8BX3Jtaa	Develop a routine to work out different areas of the body every workout, so you give them a chance to rest. Muscles only grow when they are resting, you induce micro injuries into them when you lift weights.    One day focus on the legs, other day focus on your back and biceps, other day focus on your chest and triceps, another on the abs and shoulders, then do a full body workout on the 4th day. If the next day your muscles feel sore, you're doing it right.    Also do aerobic exercise after each workout so you dont gain fat. 30 mins each is good.|`|Gpc9WHFyaa	Click on the link below to link you to a website thats for beginner weightlifters.

I must admit, it is annoying that I can't stick my tongue out past my top lip!!! but I live with it.  It is a bad idea to try and do it yourself. They do it to babies when they are young and it is simple, however when you get older there are blood vessels and stuff in it that can be trouble.

B4YESGmwaa	It sounds like you and your doctor have covered all of the bases for tests. Did she place you on any medication or suggest that you enter some type of counseling. It sounds like hormones may be an issue as far as the hot flashes, etc. Also this symptoms also go along with anxiety attacks. If the blood test and other tests came back normal then I would think the obvious issue would be anxiety. Now a days there is a lot of pressure and stress on teens. I would encourage you to consider seeing a psychiatrist and consider entering some type of counseling/talk therapy. This could be very helpful. God Bless Reggie|`|ByUS0k8waa	In order to get the right diagnosis on something like this you need to see a physiologist. They can talk with you though everything and see. As someone who was told the same things at 12 yrs old. Im saying that it sounds more like something else. Every female in my family has anxiety and anxiety attacks and they/I don't have those signs. Talk to another Dr. before you take that as your answer to the signs you have.

What you should really consider is seeing a therapist, that is someone with atleast a master's degree, probably an actual Psychologist and preferably someone with experience working with general anxiety disorder, and other types of anxiety disorders, and let them determine whether or not that is the issue.    Medical Doctors are great at diagnosing medical conditions, however, anxiety disorder is a psychological condition. While many doctors have some experience in the area, the difference is astounding. It would be like taking a motorcyle to a car mechanic. Sure he has a general idea of how engines work, but you'd really be better off seeing a motorcyle specialist right? Same thing here, see a psychologist.    The other problem is that a doctor cannot suggest how to fix the problem. They can perscribe medications, which is scarey since they aren't specifically trained in diagnosing psychological issues, but you're flipping a coin and could cause new problems. Seeing a therapist with atleast an MA/MS but preferably a PhD will do you wonders. Talk to your parents about it, and crack open the yellow pages :)|`|lUbT6womaa	These are symptoms of anxiety. I've had them all (and still continue to have them). However, I'm getting help for it.    Make sure to keep this in check. This disorder can get worse before it gets better.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Women for thousands of years have had pubic hair, which was designed to help keep bacteria away from the urethra and genitals.  In the last ten years, women suddenly think they are better off with no pubic hair.  The hair is so thick that it causes itchy and scratchy stubble, like on your legs but worse.  Waxing doesn't create this stubble.  However, in my opinion, and I have tried it, it's totally unnecessary and a waste of time.  If you have excessive hair, just trim it a little so it doesn't stick through your undies or bathing suit, and let it go.    best wishes..|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	It's a personal decision only you can make.|`|76Wp8OINaa	Shave it|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	shave it .|`|BxhC9fXEaa	You mean the outside of your vagina?

3KNnYzgqaa	It last about 2-3 days, well, that's what people told me.  It depends on the amount they need moved, and you're sensitivity. For me it lasted about 5 days.    AGONIZING PAIN    You're cheeks are going to get cut.  I suggest you don't even bother about the wax.  The cheeks will toughen up once they get used to the constant scraping, in about a week.    Braces suck.  For future advice, a half an hour before you go to get them tightened, take an aspirin. It helps the pain so much better than if you were to take them after you got them tightened.    The best advice I can give it just deal with it [not to be mean].  Meds don't really hurt when you first get them on.      oh yeah  if you chew gum  it'll eventually soften the hold of the cement  so your brackets will break of easier  so be careful      goodluck!|`|BLCdYNpIaa	yeah, i felt the same way when I first got mine on. But after just a couple of days, it will go away. And try food that is easy to eat like soup and ramen noodles. After an adjustment sometimes I can just eat like PB&J's. Those are pretty easy. And try taking like some tylenol or something. Once after a REALLY tight and hard adjustment, my teeth were hurting like crap, so i put like a heating pad on it and that helped a lot. Just like hold one on the side of your cheek or whatever. The cutting on the inside of your mouth takes a while to stop though. You eventually get used to it and you don't even notice it. And the wax is just crap in my opinion. lol! Just hang in there. =]|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	It should last for 2-3 days at most, if it lasts longer go back to your orthodontist.    Sadly, your teeth will be VERY sore any time you get your braces adjusted. It shouldn't hurt NEARLY as much as this first time, but they will be sore for a day. Stock up on soups and try to avoid drinking really cold stuff.    Take some Advil/Tylenol/Whatever, rest, and as much as it sucks do make sure you brush your teeth.|`|geMMyHfpaa	There gonna hurt alot after 1 day, since your teeth are moving.

But no matter.  When they put my daughter's braces on, the pain from the spacers lasted about three days max.  After she got the brackets on, the discomfort was again just a few days, until her cheeks got calloused.      You can take some Tylenol for the pain, and try some ice cream or sherbet to help numb your mouth for a while.  And keep waxing the heck out of the brackets until your cheeks adjust.  If the pain is in the back, see if your wires are sticking out too far.  If they are, your orthodontist should be able to clip them shorter for you.    For the record, your teeth may or may not hurt this much after adjustments.  My daughter hasn't had any pain after those first few days, and once when she had to have some brackets popped off and repositioned.  So this may be the worst you experience by far.    Good luck.  It does get easier!|`|UwA68EJWaa	Sounds right it will also hurt every time you get them tighten and even when you get a ticker wire
DhZ67kgoaa	It isn't anything like regular massage.  You leave your clothes on.  There is no oil or lotion used.  You lie on the floor.  It is more like Yoga that is done to you.
g8JGLnk6aa	Simple explanation:    The cells in your body are always dividing on a set schedule. But sometimes this schedule is interrupted (triggered by factors ranging from environmental to lifestyle to genetic), and thus the cells start dividing out of control. This creates a mass of useless body tissue -- e.g. a tumor.     Now, if this tumor stays in one place, it is not cancer. But sometimes mutant cells will break away from the tumor where it originated and travel to another location in the body. If those cells starts to divide in the new location and form a new tumor, it is now considered cancer. I think the medical term for that is "metastasize." These bad cells can spread all over the body and form tumors in various places. And the tumor cells are always the same type of cells as the original location -- e.g. if the tumor started in the breast and some of the mutant cells spread to the kidneys then there will be mutant breast cells in the kidneys.     Tumors can get very bad because like I said they are useless clumps of body tissue and they steal from the surrounding healthy tissue. Sometimes tumors can form blood vessels and steal nutrients and oxygen and other important resources.|`|2c8244371ece2e4523b40d2d84fef4b3aa	go to VITAGANZA.COM ..... there is a Phd there named John (the owner) who has developed a rather interesting thesis on this subject.

You can find a lot of excellent information on cancer at the website for the National Cancer Institute: http://www.cancer.gov/    There are many good books you can start to read. The latest edition of the World Cancer Report by the World Health Organization is excellent.  It covers topics like the Causes of Cancer, Mechanisms of Tumor Development, Prevention and Screening, etc.  It may be a little technical for you, but it is still a great source of basic information.  You can get it at Amazon.com for $40.00.  http://www.amazon.com/World-Cancer-Repor...    Your local hospital will have a medical library with many resources on cancer.  The staff there will be happy to help you in any way that they can.    Best wishes and good luck pursuing your passion.|`|AEAxZEveaa	Are you going to be a doctor? I copied wikipedia's definition so you can see it, but I'll break it down for you:    Cancer is a class of diseases in which a group of cells display uncontrolled growth (division beyond the normal limits), invasion (intrusion on and destruction of adjacent tissues), and sometimes metastasis (spread to other locations in the body via lymph or blood). These three malignant properties of cancers differentiate them from benign tumors, which are self-limited, do not invade or metastasize. Most cancers form a tumor but some, like leukemia, do not. The branch of medicine concerned with the study, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer is oncology.    Basically what that all means is that cancer cells do not behave like they are supposed to. The cells in your body each have specific functions and they cooperate with each other to help your body function. Each cell lives for a specific amount of time before it dies and your cells are programmed to stop reproducing if they become too crowded. Cancer cells don't behave like they're supposed to. They don't die off when they're supposed to, they reproduce when they're not supposed to, and they don't perform the cell functions like they need to. The regular cells recognize that it's getting crowded and start to die off.     A good way to think about it is to imagine a crew of workers building a house. They all work together to get the job done. Then imagine that one of the workers invites a few friends to the job site. There are many more people than there should be and it's getting crowded. It's becoming harder to get work done because there are so many people in the way. The construction workers start leaving. All of the extra people bring more friends, and eventually there are no workers left and the construction comes to a halt. This is the way to look at cancer. Normal, working cells get crowded out by non-working cells.|`|EpCo6Kjoaa	Basically, all cells undergo a process of growth and differentiation: they divide. Every cell has certain controls that STOP cell division. When a person has cancer, these controls are dysfunctional, which means cell division goes on and on. A tumor is basically an abnormal conglomeration of body cells that result from this. I'd say google oncology, maybe volunteer in your hospital's oncology department, read things in the library, etc. Good luck! =)

BB76pnzzaa	I think short term they do help (i have used slim fast), but in the long term they really don't. First off, you're going to get so sick of them that you may binge. and even if you dont, it's not realistic to think that you will be able to eat them your whole life. I would recommend transitioning to other low calorie options that are more realistic as part of a diet, like some kashi cereal with nonfat milk in the morning, and tuna or turkey sandwhiches on whole grain bread for lunch.|`|3QqKaxQ4aa	Yes, you will lose weight on them.  I usually only do it at the beginning of starting a workout plan so that my stomach will shrink,  but you should not rely on that only. I had very low energy and headaches as well.|`|AgiwOGbUaa	if you do a liquid diet you need to make your own shakes and have 25-30g of protein and carbs in them. But don't do a liquid diet as you will just gain it back afterwards.  Just have 5 small meals, one of them being a shake. Eat right and just exercise regularly(3 times a week). Eat organic natural fruits too, and lean meats. Good luck!

QU37MZi7aa	when you said "nap", how long or how many hours? a nap is just a matter of minutes to rest your body for a while. not exactly to sleep. the normal sleeping hours that is on night time is 7~8hours. and sleeping in the afternoon doesn't count, i assume. resting at night time and resting in the afternoon is different. well, just my opinion too. if i were you, avoid taking naps in the afternoon and just sleep early for 8hours and you'll wake up the same time everyday.

KGhA6cWwaa	A good sword shouldn't weigh more than about a kilo. I use one in reenactment fights.   you use a lot of   --lower arm, -when striking, and combating your opponents moves  --shoulder(particularly front deltoid) -as the sword is above your head a lot this always using your shoulder. (Anything above your head is all shoulder)  --Wrist muscles -probably the most important muscle for sword control and manovering the tip of your sword.  and some lats. - in the bigger swings|`|hSOEgpPNaa	You would use most of your upper body muscles, especially your biceps and shoulder muscles.|`|A3axVsjuaa	Biceps: any kind of bicep curl, dips    Shoulders: Military press, shrugs    Triceps: tricep extensions, tricep pushdowns    Chest: (lower) decline bench press (mid) flat bench press, dumbell flies, (upper) incline bench press    that should get you started anyway. I also sword fight (not fencing. although it may be kinda fun) I've been practicing since third grade and i'm a freshman in college now. good luck, and dont hurt yourself, either working out, or when you practice with your swords.  I've never had any injuries in the weight room, but i've had many cuts and scrapes and stab wounds due to being cocky with swords, lol.  I lack the discipline and form

8cuPVvYnaa	Raise your head up while sleeping (some blankets under your pillows or blocks under the top side of your bed). Eat light in the evening and not at least 2 or more hours before bed. Avoid spicy, acidic foods. Take an acid reducer med. Good luck.|`|WsbsPi1Oaa	Zantac usually helps. If it persists, try Prilosec. I get acid reflux a lot, these medicines seem to help.|`|LptR3RWgaa	I've heard having orange juice or something else acidic helps.

W. . . .T. . . . . .F?"|`|OI3bf4yjaa	If your discharge has a yellowish greenish look to it, that could possibly mean that you have an infection. If it resembles cottage cheese.. there's something wrong. Go see a doctor.|`|9da334de0d8258350046544850e0fa57aa	take mine and everyone elses advice. do see a doctor so whatever kinda of infection or whatever it could be can get cleared up fast|`|F2ishnWOaa	That's bad. Tinge of green usually means there's an infection. Better get in touch with a gyno asap.|`|378GRzrnaa	Its normally white i suggest you go and see a doctor asap
NljTFEIvaa	It sounds like a bacterial infection but because i'm not a doctor of any kind i don't know. Yellow/green mucus means that there is an infection and the nose bleeds could be anything from stress or the heat.  You being the only one not sick would mean your body is immune to whatever they have or you haven't come that close in contact with them... which i kind of doubt seeing it's your family.  If it gets worse, or even stays the same, then you should go to a doctor. They would either give you antibiotics (depends on what it is and sometimes what doctor you have) or just tell you to let it run its course. More than likely their body's can fight the infection.   Just keep up their fluids and rest; lots of movie nights and soups i suppose :)    I hope they all get well :)|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Take them to the doc immediately as this can turn into something serious!!|`|B8Gwxo1laa	See a doctor. Fever over 100, yellow mucous suggests infection.|`|AA11764232	go to a hospital and have them seen by a dr.  sounds like something that needs to be checked out  all 3 sick with the same thing??/|`|Y9hBknBuaa	um i don't know... see a doctor!!!|`|gSo4dR7oaa	Why are you asking people on YA what to do?  You can NOT get appropriate diagnosis and treatment by computer. Fever is an indication of infection, but there is no way for us to know if it is bacterial or viral.  The ONLY way you will be able to find out exactly what is causing the symptoms is by taking them to the doctor!! It sounds as if you should have taken them to the doctor days ago.  Take them to a doctor!!!!
q9i5f0rXaa	Tell him to man up and eat some food!  Seriously, though, he should opt for the low-cost, high protein options.  Ground beef is less than $2/lb, so even if he eats 2 lbs. a day that's only $4.  Add that to his diet, I guarantee he'll get the scale moving in the right direction.  Granted it takes diligence and hard work to eat that much, but it can be done.  I'd be surprised if he's eating as much as you think.
HiSVA9p8aa	Oh sweetie.  I SO feel for you.  There is absolutely medication that can help you.      I had an episode about two years ago where I would wake up in the morning and go lie down on the couch crying and shaking until I fell asleep.  The medication I got from my doctor took effect within two weeks.  It's called Cipralex and it's fairly new as SSRI's go.  (Selective Serotonin Re-uptake Inhibitor  - they work on helping our brains properly deal with the chemicals in our bodies.)    This CAN be treated.  There are several different medications.  I know many people who have taken medication for either depression or anxiety or both.  None of the medications make you feel like a numb zombie.  As a matter of fact, you don't actually feel anything.  You just start to feel better.    Do follow the doctor's order though.  One thing about these medications is that there is a withdrawal period so you can't just stop taking them all at once like you do with an antibiotic.    PLEASE show this response to your Mom.  Although "talk treatment" is usually useful for depression and anxiety, it is not necessarily enough.  I'm a 51 year old woman.  If you want, email me through YA email.  I would be happy to engage in a dialogue with your Mom if that would help.    My best to you.    Edit:  I just read the other responses.  In my first 'episode' about 8 years ago, I was on Zoloft.  It worked great and I had no side effects at all.  But, it does take 4 to 6 weeks to take effect.  That's why my doctor recommended Cipralex this time.  As well, I know people on Xanax and it works perfectly for controlling their anxiety problems/    This is NOT 'all in your mind'.  Mental illness is real.  Just as real as a bacteial infection or a broken bone.  There is nothing 'wrong' with you.  You are a normal person who is currently suffering with an illness.|`|ef7e4d26174134848be66e4501e42d90aa	I got medicine for both depression and anxiety and I have to say it was one of the best things I've done in my life.

I used to feel really depressed, crying for no reason, being nervous all the time for no reason..i was a mess! i've been on the meds for a couple months and i've had a complete turn around!  just remember the first few weeks being on any medication, you probably will have side effects.they will likely pass so give it some time to work. it took me about 4 to 6 weeks before my side effects went away.    i hope i helped!  good luck!=]|`|1t7r2eE6aa	Hello. I have had anxiety for years. I am on Zoloft and slowly was increased in dosage. I wish I wouldnt have waited so long to try it. All the little things that drive me nuts and put me on edge and make me want to kick someone in the face dont bother me as much anymore. Im able to let all the millions of little things that add up to a huge amount of stressful crap just go.   I dont regret it for a second. Let me give you some advice. It will take awhile to get used to the medicine. Be aware that it will actually make you feel worse for a short time while your body adjusts to the medication. But stick with it. The relief is SO worth it.   I had a hard time adjusting. I felt like I was going crazy at times and it interrupted my sleep at nite. But it was only for like a wek and a half and all the sudden every thing just clicked.  I too have anxiety attacks daily. The medication doesnt stop them completly but believe me they help and they help with the depression so much also.   Also realize that not all medications work for everyone. So after a month or so if you dont feel any relief dont be afraid to say something to your doctor. Zoloft worked for me but it may not work for everyone.  There are other drugs out there.  Make sure you tell the doctor your thoughts and how you feel. I had crazy thoughts going through my mind too. I still do sometimes. Like thoughts of hurting myself or breaking something. Or smacking someone! lol Very random and I wouldnt ever do them it just made me feel uncomfortable with my thoughts.  Anyhow, dont be ashamed and give the medication a chance! I wish I could tell every person who suffers from this to try it. I resisted taking medication for years because I thought I could do it on my own. I would have saved myself years of Hell!|`|AJi9N6K9aa	I've been dealing with anxiety and depression for about 12 years now (half my life!) and have tried a lot of different things but nothing seems to help. You definately should try another phyciatrist since some just flat out suck. Unfortunately sometimes you've got go through a few to get one that actually really cares. Xanax may help your panic attacks -thats what I'm taking now but it doesnt work too well for me. It might for you though since everybodies different. But seriously, keep looking to find a doc that actually cares and try different meds to see what works best for you. I am looking for a better doc right now since I am so desperate to feel better and stop having panic attacks all the time. I hope you find a doctor and a medicine that will make you feel better soon. I know how you feel and I know it really, really, really sucks.

ojVl4Gowaa	I had such a hard time putting in my contacts the first time (also colored contacts) so I know how you feel! I couldn't stop the reflex that closes your eyes when your jabbing foreign objects in them lol. It took over an hour until my (now) husband made me use my fingers to keep my eye open (one at a time) while he put the contacts in.    After that, I just used the force of my hand to open my eye as wide as possible. I do not look up when I put them, though many people do. For me, it wouldn't work so I just focus on the mirror and placing the contact on directly to the pupil.     As for the inside out issue, it takes awhile to know. If the contact is in a perfect bowl shape it is right side out, if the contact seems flattened/not perfect little bowl shape then it's inside out. You can also tell that they're inside out if you put them in and they slip off the pupil every time you blink your eyes.     It takes awhile to perfect the contact lense insertion, especially if you're like me and waited until you were 22 years old to try it. I still open my eyes with my fingers to cram them in, but I also have narrow eyes from my partial Asian heritage.    Good luck!|`|eiFQ0mHCaa	Your doctor usually helps you put the first pair in - so you really should go back before you ruin any more pairs.    Also - my contacts from Acuvue have a 123 on them - so you can tell if they are inside out because the numbers are backwards.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i suggest you go to your eye doctor and have them help you put them in so you know what to do next time.

It's okay, we all go through it...|`|qcB23QvZaa	are you just looking for people to tell you that you're not fat?|`|QsbB6vkoaa	you are definitely not fat, i bet you are beautiful, what seems to be the problem is your self esteem. instead of working out try talking to someone you trust, and try and come up with things you like about yourself.  just think of all the things your body does for you, you shouldn't be ashamed of it you should be thankful.  go to  http://www.seventeen.com/vows to sign up and start to love your body.|`|AA11348638	Maybe you need psychological help since you are not considered fat.  For your height you could weigh about 130 to 140 pounds and not be "fat".  If your waist is 17 inches, which seems almost impossible since women had to wear corsetts to get that small, you don't need keys to a flat stomach, you already know them.|`|QcFZE8Bxaa	You're thin. Worry about more important things.|`|nlQyTrLhaa	.........u know i'd really try to comfort u (although u'r not fat at all) but i just feel really jealous right now.......|`|tX7BKRP1aa	Hey, hey, hey. You are NOT fat, at all. In fact, you could probably gain a couple pounds. If you feel fat all the time, tell someone (your parents, teacher)...sometimes positive reassurance and a little bit of talking can do wonders. =D|`|y8OhPOt3aa	dude. thats like my goal. Im 5'2 and uhh weigh a lot more than you    Don't mean to sound harsh. But get over it.  It's ok my 90lbs friend asked me if she was fat and ugly {and she's like the prettiest girl in school} and i was like  "Ash are you flipping serious?"|`|DRTM8M07aa	You're not fat (yes I know, you don't want to read that again, but it's true). However, there is nothing wrong with wanting to get in better shape! Everyone could be a bit healthier, you know. The key to get a flat stomach is a mixture core workouts and cardio. Buy an exercise DVD and workout with it a couple times a week. I personally use Women's Health: Amy Dixon's Perfect Body Workout. It's been a great video, it was only $15, and the workouts are divided into sections on the DVD, so you can spend a little or a lot amount of time working out.    Being "fat" means being overweight or obese, which means having a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 25 or higher. You have a BMI of 18.9, which is considered a healthy weight, though it is borderline underweight - you are considered underweight when you have a BMI of 18.5 or less.    Also, since you are technically thin, but you feel fat and you feel like you look fat, you might have something called Body Dysmorphic Disorder. It's a condition where your brain does not correctly interpret what you look like. A lot of people who have eating disorders suffer from this. I even do a little bit to be honest - I have a BMI of 19, and a lot of times when I look in the mirror, it looks like I have thunder thighs and a lot of fat around my midsection. But I don't... I think it's just a common thing for teenage girls to get. If it's really bad though (you think about it all the time, you're depressed, you are embarassed and have a lack of motivation), you should consult a therapist - because it's not good to feel bad about your body, especially a thin girl like you!    I really hope what I said helped you, and I hope you feel better :] Good luck.
XFVUejr4aa	It could be high too high for her to reach with her fingers. There is nothing at all wrong with that and another doctor might be able to find it.|`|qbbNtGVcaa	maybe its just the way your body is or go somewhere else to get it done. maybe someone else can do it better  good luck :)|`|378GRzrnaa	go and ask a different doctor.|`|18OshFjqaa	Ask a different doctor...Its the best thing to do...You want an answer an explination....Find a doctor that can do that...
HbQmDGb6aa	If you want to lose weight, technically all you have to do is watch your calories. If you wanted to eat 1,200 calories of peanut butter a day, have at it-you'll still drop the pounds. It would NOT be the healthy thing to do. Daily values are recommended because of proven nutritional science. Your body needs almost 60% of its intake from carbs, for basic function (did you know that your brain only functions on carbs for fuel, nothing else?). Many people eat more than the recommended DV of protein when on a diet because they think of fat and carbs as "bad" and so restrict them and replace with protein. Fats, when chosen properly, are wonderful. The good mono- and poly- unsaturated fats (avocado, seeds, nuts, fish, oils) are so good for you. They promote all kinds of good stuff, far too much for me to list. Don't eat protein in replacement of your DV of fat- your body will just pee it out since it can't process an excess of protein efficiently. It will use the fats efficiently if consumed to their recommended amount.   As far as vitamins and minerals, you'll want to try to follow them as a general rule. For most things, if you have relatively small variations from the limits (either too low or too high), not much will happen. I personally eat tons of salt, and since I drink tons of water to counteract it I think it's okay. I am no where near having high blood pressure! salt in particular i'm most lenient with when it comes to going over, mostly because i do drink so much water. just stay within reason, but don't be crazy about limiting youself to the DV number. you'll eat yucky bland food if you do that! haha|`|kGsRFXRhaa	If you are only eating 1200 kcals a day, you can't go by the % on the package because those are % based on a 2000 kcal diet. If you are trying to lose weight and weighing yourself daily, you are going to see big fluctuations in your weight due to retaining fluids. Sodium causes you to retain fluids. Which can be bad if you have a sodium sensitivity (meaning you have issues with high blood pressure or have increased blood pressure when you ingest sodium). The 2 things to pay most attention to are kcals and calories from fat, If most of the calories are coming from fat, this is not a good thing because it is a very fatty food. Every gram of fat is 9 calories. So if you see a food that is say 150 kcal and has 80 kcals from fat, that means over 50% of those calories are coming from fat. All the % DV crap are really not useful|`|L7kGiVsraa	If your trying to lose weight then yes it will definitely benefit you to pay attention to fat protein carbs etc. there are certain websites you can go to help you track these. one i used to use all the time is livestrong.com but there are millions out there that you'll probably like better just google it or something.
t2CFnQnDaa	flat belly is overrated, I like bellies that are a bit round (more natural).    Anyway, if you still want to go flat, do some ab workouts to build that six pack.|`|M9X9usmzaa	First if your already skinny dont try going on any bad diets.  Do not drop all carbs, then you will just be tired ALL the time.  get some good cardio exercise in and do sit ups and crunches.  building some muscles could help that problem.|`|r5Psh5Doaa	crunches!  do 100 crunches daily & in 2 weeks yu will see a difference  trust me I had this problem|`|gptsLYNRaa	Crunches    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKg_cdwq9...|`|xFSYFojOaa	have u missed ur period? u might be pregnant|`|n5Lu1bd0aa	prossesed food is not good for Bones and cause weigh problems I have done great depth of investigation, try eating Vegetables, cholera, spiralina , you can intake more nutrient from broccoli spinach ect.  but i advise going total raw food cause you do not get as much nutrition from cooked food over 150 degrees Celsius,That means no Prosesed Food, like bread, juice, energy drinks ect, you may get a flat stomach faster eating raw food!

ETcBRko3aa	You need to walk away.  Do not provoke him, simply get up and walk away.    I work with kids who get angry and act-out and sometimes we walk away in the classroom and let them have their space to act-out.  Once they realize no-one is listening, they start to calm down.|`|Syn2excFaa	I think he needs to see a psychiatrist to give him medication to calm him down. This is definitely not normal and he needs to be controlled before he does something that will put yourselves or himself in danger.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I agree with the walk away thing. I have bipolar disorder, and when I get frustrated over something stupid, I have a total meltdown. I have asked my husband to just stay away for a couple hours and let me have my meltdown & calm myself down, which usually takes a couple of hours.  I think he worries I am trying to hurt/kill myself (have tried before) but if he comes to check on me, I will just verbally abuse him because I haven't calmed down yet.  I'm not looking for attention - I am just completely overwhelmed & can't handle talking to another person when I am like that.  So it doesn't have to be to get attention.    Your brother needs to be getting counseling and be seeing a psychiatrist with this sort of behavior. If your parents are not doing that for him, they are negligent.  His behavior will get worse as he gets older.  Is he on drugs?  Mental illnesses don't generally cause violent behavior - it's the substance abuse that can go along with the illness as people try to "self medicate."|`|AA11966419	Do not walk away from that monster, but don't become a victim either. Let him know that you don't search for that normally so you don't know where to find what works. Tell him how you go about finding something. Sounds like he's got some ticks to work out. But you shouldn't be responsible for figuring that out. That's why people specialize and get paid to do it.|`|6SIjchQUaa	Your parents need to get him to the doctor and a therapist.|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	i dunno anti-depressants?  stress relieving balls  dogs?? they help relieve stress  if you release the stress, the anger should come out too  try a therapist, even if he doesnt want one. deep inside he wants to talk to someone, it would be easier for him if he was forced to talk since he might be a bit reluctant to share his feelings.

1tQef9edaa	Ok, I am in the same boat. I have always had to use clitoral stimulation, even during sex. My husband & I have been trying a new position, weird but we call it sideways. He lies the opposite way that I am, than we come together b/t the legs, our legs are all tangled up, BUT, it feels great! You can't get going really fats but just the little movement feels amazing. I don't know if it is just because he is going in sideways..One important thing. Relax!! Have him warm you up before you try ( i always say i need to get things going first) have him kiss up and down your need slowly?? whatever you need to wake things up down stairs without touching your clitoral spot! Than take a deep breath and start. I have found that if my mind isn't completely into it neither is my G spot! It feels just like working up toward your orgasm as you would any other time. I have to admit my husband and I are still working on it. I want to have and orgasm just from him, not with clit stimulation. All I know is that it gets soooooooo close but won't get to the next level,, it like stalls. Like it is just there but than I lose it. I think it is because i am trying to hard. I need to just relax. We are working on this about 2 times a week. I am determined to get one that way! GOOD LUCK to u!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	This is like trying to describe a sneeze. You know what you want to say, but there are no words that say it. Very tingly... numb. It's hard to explain. Not all women can have an orgasm through g-spot stimulation, though.|`|AZoOruwcaa	it feels...like you have to pee but REALLY good....um...i dont know how to explain it. but what feels AMAZING is clitoral and g-spot stimulation at the same time....so good....|`|7uV0SAWnaa	During G spot orgasm, some women eject a fluid - few drops to a cup or so. There are lots of places on the internet, that describes g-spot.  Just type g-spot or female ejaculation and search. Then you will see  lots of web pages and read the pages you want. There is so much written on this subject, and,  I am sure, you will get tired of reading about it before long..
ETcBRko3aa	Getting thinner  Drinking water ALL the time  Pushing food around on her plate  Saying "I had a big breakfast"  Getting pale  Eating apples or raisans (when forced in situations to eat)|`|B24W8w43aa	Avoiding eating around people.

Dehydration - often the skin becomes raw and looses elasticity.|`|0ea532f4f64dbcab2fea6b950194850aaa	everything the first poster wrote plus:    rapid weight loss is the biggest sign.   another big sign is people who love to cook or bake for other people, but rarely eat what they make.   "I ate just before i got here" or "i ate just before i came over"   constantly talking about weight, or other people's weight or dieting.|`|CgOs2ViPaa	Aw, you're such a nice friend!   Well obviously, drastic weight loss in a short amount of period. And kind of study the way she looks at food. Does she look at it in a nonchalant or conflicted manner. I don't have anorexia but I do have disordered eating and food is definitely the number one enemy of anyone that has food issues. Oh, and note her mood. Like is she depressed/sad all the time? If so, it might be because she's upset that she gained weight, didn't stick to her eating plans, etc. if she really does have an eating disorder. And if all else fails, just take her to a fast food place because the last place an anorexic would want to eat is a lovely, high calorie, greasy fast food restaurant and if she seems off about it or tries to avoid eating, then she would probably have some sort of eating issue.    Wow, this is really long haha. But I really hope everything is fine with your friend. You can always talk to her about her problems too
6ri6UGsoaa	I think it should be O.K. Of course, the counselor knows her better then the psychiatrist, but I doubt it will hurt it in the mean time. Your daughter sounds desperate for help, and the doctor won't have given her something that he thought would hurt her. Your counselor is not trained in meds like the psychiatrist, which is why I presume you went to one in the first place. I think it should be O.K. I was on Zoloft for a while and for almost exactly the same behaviors as your daughter. I was younger then your daughter when I started having trouble ,but, unfortunately, I didn't want to take meds and my parents didn't make me, and because I didn't, I ended up doing some destructive behaviors and having a very hard time during my teen years. I started Zoloft a little later then your daughter and was on it for about 2 years.  I am not on Zoloft now because I've found that Abilify works better for me, but that's just my body and personality. I think it should be alright, but you have to go with your mommy instincts on this one....just remember that your counselor doesn't know all...and that the doctor gave it to your baby for a reason. Good luck and I hope things work out for you both!|`|0ea532f4f64dbcab2fea6b950194850aaa	If you are concerned about possible affects or want a second opinion then call her primary care physician. Even though her pcp is not the one that prescribed the medication, she is the most knowledgable person regarding medication as well as your daughter's health history and past. Not to mention, her pcp should have a pretty good grasp on your daughter's personality (assuming she's been seeing the same doctor for a while) and most qualified health professionals will be able to distinguish between quirky personality traits in a child and a child with behavioral or mood disorders.     I have been on zoloft in the past, i didn't honestly notice much of a difference either way - no negative affects, but no real overwhelming positive affects either, but i suppose everyone reacts differently.     When i went on the zoloft i was in high school, probably 15 years old, but i was also started on medication at the age of 11, for generalized anxiety disorder and depression (i began on paxil). I mean, I really don't think it will hurt to try it (particularly if it's a low dosage, which i imagine it would be for an 11 year old child whose never been medicated before). Just moniter your daughter more closely and look for any extreme changes in mood or behavior. The drug will probably take at least two weeks to even take a remote affect, could take up to a month. If the drug does do anythign it will most likely help her, which is why i think it would be good to at least try it. But, like i said, in rare cases anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medications can cause adverse affects in children under 18, and can actually lead to a worsened condition - but you sound like an incredibly concerned and attentive parent, so if you notice anything, talk to a doctor immediately about getting her off the medication. Overall though, she should be fine, she is obviously hurting which is so unfortunate, you owe her at least a trial period to help her live comfortably.     goodluck|`|OyBuEpOTaa	A councilor is not necessarily trained in pharmacology. Your daughter has a serious case. Is it that You re feeling stigmatized because your daughter needs a psych medication?     You can look it up online and get lots of information, but you are not going to know how that applies to your daughters needs. That is what the psychiatrist is for.     All you need to know is what adverse side effects to watch out for. Then you report it to the doctor. ( a psychiatrist is also a medical doctor.) Do not stop the medication abruptly !!. I can't emphasize this enough.|`|AA11915664	first you need to talk to the councelor if you have questions or concerns.  your dtr has OCD, etc and that is miserable. it likely consumes and controls her life. at her current age anything smacking of social stigma is larger than life.   zoloft is a first line, very safe antidepressant that is used with great success in adolescents.  my son grew up with ocd.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	Zoloft is a widely used and common medication used to treat the types of problems your daughter is experiencing, it really just depends on how you feel about her taking medication in general.

YPIxPs2Uaa	You should try to get your hands on some Midrin. It is the cure-all for anything headache-related for me. In most states it isn't a fully controlled substance so you can actually get it from one of those new drugstore clinics(like Walgreens take care, CVS minute clinic). Or you can wait and see your regular doctor and ask for some tomorrow. You can also order it online. It's basically a combination pill with tylenol, a muscle relaxant, and vein adjustor to take away the pain and calm you down.|`|9pLdhuBnaa	You can try taking something like Tylenol or Excedrin (if this headache is similar to like a migraine) but these are examples only.

0c26d9546e638de3a2d0bd923ac856beaa	That sucks, dear.  It's good to vent.  I had to go on steroids when I was 20 for about a year, and I gained a bunch of weight.  At first it was really hard, but I've grown used to it.  I mean, I lost some of the weight, but am nowhere near where I was before the meds.  I'm happy with the way I look now, and even though I'm 7 sizes larger than I was before, I feel gorgeous in my wedding dress and all the clothes my family got me for Christmas.  The hospital has to be the most depressing place ever; things will look up when you get out of there.  For distraction, here are some ideas:    Write letters to your favorite authors, actors, etc.  You can get free autographed pictures from many actors if you write to them.    Pick up a hobby like origami, crocheting, knitting, model-making, etc.    Try online games that take a lot of exploring like neopets dot com and travians dot com.    Look for a safe, friendly chat room for others in the hospital.  I'm sure there are many out there.    Get interested in new movies by looking up favorite actors on imdb dot com and seeing what else they have been in.    Get interested in new books by reading books by the same author of other books you like.    Ask someone to get you a self-help book about your situation.  Self help books really can help!    Chin up, young person.  There is hope!|`|d789bc0defab78c82f864f62f2e79afaaa	I had a medical experience in which I was not allowed to eat for about a month and a half.

Watching DVDs, reading, listening to music, writing in a journal, doing crossword puzzles, drawing, playing cards, surfing the Internet, all of these activities will help to keep your mind off your situation.      In my case, I was unable to do any physical activity.  However, if you are able to, you might want to try to get some fresh air, and some exercise.    Try to get the support of your family and friends in not talking about or preparing food where you can see or smell it.    Best of luck to you.  I know how difficult this can be.

HA! takes the edge off, i really get into it. try online poker *blush*. get a web cam, chit chat w/ friends. read trendy magazines, but dont get too upset you dont look like the hot models on the covers, itll pass *sigh*    just eat the food, ok?    dont worry about your appearance right now, concentrate on getting better. be happy you have real friends who care about you, and dont judge you. take a shower, if theyll let you. makes you feel fresh and alive. do they have a bath tub in your unit? oooooh bubbles, warm silky soft ... ahhhhh!

I couldn't imagine being on them and not being able to eat, they made me starve to the point where I was calling my mom constantly to bring me food in the hospital because they didn't feed enough.  I know what you mean about the face breaking out (Proactiv helped me a lot) and the 'moon face'.  It goes away eventually.  Steroids also make your moods go wacko.  Talk to your doctor.  He/she might be able to put on an anti depressant to help you feel better.  Also ask about water pills, they took the swelling in my face down in about a day or two.  Just hang in there, it will be over before you know it.  Also, invest in a good hand held game system that's how I got through my almost month long hospital stay.

The ones most likely to hurt the kidneys are astringent ones, high in tannins, like Bilberry leaf, White Oak bark, Uva Ursi leaves and Juniper berries. None of these are "Chinese herbs" ; they are Western. I don't know the individual herbs used in Chinese medicine (except for a few like Ginseng, Dong Quai, et.al.) so I would not take them except under the advice of a qualified herbalist that I trusted. Generally, astringent herbs can be recognized because they are drying to the tongue if you chew them or drink a strong tea.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Each individual item has its own information about it.You cant group thousands of plants into one catagory like that.|`|uuHDQr1paa	I think your kidney is a lot tougher than you give it credit for.  Besides, if you lose 1, you still have a backup.  So eat those herbs Hop Sing.|`|GZNIw2zEaa	well anything can b bad for you if u hav too much of it no matter what it is
28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	I'm no doctor, but it sounds to me like you have some sort of infection or something. You need to go back to your doctor and find out what's going on, especially if you are in this much pain.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I agree with the first poster, you need to see a doctor about this. You shouldn't be hurting this long after your surgery. How can you say the doctors have been helpful if you're still in pain???    I can't give you any answers, but you need to keep working with a doctor. You could still have an infection without a fever. Keep trying to find a cause, this is not normal. Good luck!|`|XkuR8ZJPaa	Has the doctor checked your gallbladder?  It can cause pains and changes in bowel habits.|`|AA10718475	it would be impossible for you to have another appendecitis agian right? cuz it has been removed. It could be the lax that you are taking, I suggest that you visit your doc and tell him your querries.|`|hwIMJBVpaa	infection, do you have a fever?
s8QZ4cCmaa	Go for a run, do a little exercise. When you've warmed up you won't click as much. Backbends are amazing, rather rewarding too!    Also, maybe do some other stretches before you go straight into backbends?    Hope this helped :)  ~ Bini|`|t93uTYK0aa	yes, there is a way to stop the chest cracks....  stop doing backbends.

4KNZ0xefaa	you have to gain weight. it sounds weird but i just gained like 5 lbs since last month and i got it. i weigh 91 lbs. and you WONT start it at 16!!!! just bring pads to school just in case because it will definitely come soon!  and dont think about it! pretend you already have it. its no big deal and nobody knows if you do or not. the more you know, the more prepared you willl be!      and also... if you don't have it by the time you are 16, they give you a shot or something that induces periods, so no matter what, you will get it!|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I think you will regret it once you do get it. I got my period very young [9.5] and I wish I were you! There is not a thing you can do to speed it up. Just wait it out and you will get it eventually. Don't say I did not warn you, though. Enjoy not having cramps, bloating, headaches, and not being bitchy. Once you start your period, once a month will seem like once a day!|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	There isn't much you can do about making it start. It's not a fun thing to have. I've had mine for 40+ years and I'm just praying it will stop.|`|bYU77eteaa	geeze...ENJOY the time you have without it...it's a responsibility and you will get it in due time.  Some people are 18 and older before they start its normal|`|Msd9PiRGaa	...Alright.|`|TXXNLDVEaa	i know exactly how you feel, i'm 15 now but didn't get my period til i was 14. I know you hear this all the time, and i know it doesn't make you feel any better but YOU ARE SO LUCKY enjoy your time with no period they're stupid!! and they're sooo annoying! i actually posted a question similar to this once and guess what! i started the very next day =] so just be patient it will come when you least expect it. so always carry pads with you|`|A4bdvg1Yaa	HAHAHAHA, everyone thinks they want their period,  until they get it.    periods suck balls,  what is good about bleeding for 5 days every month,  and getting blood on your pants,underwear, your bed, and buying pads and shiizz all the time.    what about that is appealing to you?|`|XoNKECCKaa	As much as you may want it, its really not something to enjoy!|`|CgOs2ViPaa	lol well nobody here can do anything about it and you can't do anything about it either so just be patient and wait! it'll come sometime. and trust me, once you get it, you don't EVER want it again...|`|Q8etYn60aa	Honey I didn't get mine until I was 15!  You can't make it start faster and you can't predict when it will start.  And trust me, it's not as great as it seems.|`|KncPJwIaaa	young lady when wish things like that you wish them away i remember when my sister got hers she was a beast and she was 13 so don't rush mother nature cause she is a mother* @!|`|11Vgs45Naa	I know how you feel. All my friends have. ALL six of my closest friends got it all at the same time in one week. But I was the only one who didn't start in that week.     I still haven't started. I'm 12.5...and I'm really skinny so I don't expect to start soon. I don't have any chest besides buds.     True, I don't have it, and I kind of want it, but everyone I know absolutely dreads it. So I'm going to enjoy the time without it now!|`|9ko5WUFkaa	You body will start your period when it's ready - there's nothing you can do about it, sorry.    I can't believe you want you period just cause your friends have and you want to fit in.  Wait till you get it, you won't think it's so cool then.  I bet you're friends are envious that you don't have to deal with it.  Especially those first years - you never know when it's going to start, it's messy, you can get cramps and feel like crap, you might get more pimples, you'll have times that you don't want to do things you normally enjoy - it's a barrel of fun.    Seriously, why do you feel the need to "fit in" so bad?  It will happen and when it does you'll wish it hadn't.  If i were you I'd have a talk to your mum about it, ask her when she got hers - sometimes it can give you an indication of when you might start.  And don't be embarrassed about talking to her - it's so normal (happens to all women) and she's been having them for many years now.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	The start of the periods occur once you reach a curtain weight rather than age from what I understand.    All you have to do is wait until you weigh enough.  It is nothing to worry about.    I am rather curious to know why you want to have periods faster, woman hate periods, they are usually uncomfortable at some times.  It is not the kind of thing that I would expect someone to be looking forward to getting.    CREED|`|YMbaFWA2aa	Soon!.  Im 13 I got last month and I thought to my self Wow  This is what i wanted and then I literlay got upset because you feel awkward ,sick, tired ,stressed,, you get PIMPLES  around that time.  If you leak everyone knows. It also makes you appear FAT.  Trust me you ll get it by the age of 14 with those symptoms .|`|ZUCkh7dmaa	Um NO you don't. That's all I have to say.|`|R436ld2faa	there is no way to stop faster except increase your body fat %%! it donesn't make sense that you would want to get it faster because it is just a pain!|`|rVRcMakVaa	Honey, trust me starting is not fun! You will hate it after a while. Let nature take its course and don't rush being young.|`|KJLb8Hb5aa	I was twelve when I first got my period, everybody starts at different times, a couple of my friends haven`t got it yet either. Also, your friend randomly talking about their period, kinda weird and stupid. You do not even have to tell your mom about it, you just go buy your own tampons or pads. The gooey white stuff is normal, I got that about 3 months before I got my period and have been getting it 3 days before my period starts.    Guess that`s all I can tell you.|`|so3SKTUjaa	WHY?!? you'll gust be in  paine|`|y8OhPOt3aa	Trust me you dont.  I'm 13 and I started and it personally SUCKS.  You will want to carry a pad around in your purse just in case though  It's really embarrassing to get it during class,borrow someone's jacket and go find a pair of smelly gym shorts.  There really is no telling when someone starts because everyone is different.  Usually you start around the time your mom did  Ya know, gnetica and junk.    Plus when you start--PMS is really retarded. My freinds always get mad at me and my mood swings every couple days of the month.    Trust me it's worth the wait|`|Cla3lff2aa	You're going to have to talk to your mom about it anyways. Its a fact of life sweetheart. And trust me, you may be excited for it now, but I guarantee you after you get it, give it like 5 months before you HATE it. Consider yourself lucky. The late bloomers are always the girl who turn out the most beautiful (or so I'm told, and have had some experience)   I didn't get mine until I was 16. But I'm 21 now and getting married to the greatest guy in the world. Maybe because I was a late bloomer all my life and get to do the most important stuff early, like getting married and starting a family. Enjoy not having it while you still can and just have fan. Who cares about the other girls in your class. They are just going to hate it soon than you. Thats all.|`|bBQEOeGSaa	sweetie NO U DONT it sucks cuz u cant alwats predict it and then u have it my luck is i always get it when i wear white pants!!    u dont want it   i was the same wat tul now|`|tVHFekZlaa	soon? i mean most girls from 9-16. also it will not make you happy, i bet!
fEBOzWeXaa	Are you always nauseous or are you just afraid of becoming nauseous and barfing?  This is a prescription drug and you cannot get it any other way.  Frankly, everyone fears barfing.  Its a horrid experience and I would rather shave my eyeballs than barf.  If you feel like barfing all the time, there maybe something else wrong and you should see a doctor.  if you just worry about maybe having to barf.  you are going to have to learn to deal with it.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	If it's a prescription drug, you can't get it without a prescription.     Hence the existence of doctors, pharmacies, and prescriptions.
fpuHVNYgaa	yes|`|1gnNDagMaa	Hep B is a virus, there are no cures for viruses. If you acquired the vaccine, you wont get the infection. The virus can be controlled, it can not be cured. What your family member got was treatment for symptoms to get under control. The can still spread it but through blood. So yes you can pass through by having sex or dirty needs.  Acute infection with hepatitis B virus is associated with acute viral hepatitis - an illness that begins with general ill-health, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, body aches, mild fever, dark urine, and then progresses to development of jaundice. It has been noted that itchy skin has been an indication as a possible symptom of all hepatitis virus types. The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people. A few patients may have more severe liver disease (fulminant hepatic failure), and may die as a result of it. The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized.

iksF9tQAaa	You are probably having an allergic reaction to either your deodorant, shaving cream, soap, or anything used under your arms.  I suggest that you buy some sensitive skin deodorant, ect...    I had the same problem with deodorant  If that doesnt work, contact your doctor:)|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	do not put on deodorant right after shaving and use clinical strength|`|735a1fad9c8148cb945ff4708a253a00aa	You may have some kind of an infection in your sweat glands or you could be having sensitivity to deodorant, detergent or something.

Edit: OH YEAH, after I read the article, from the above answerer, it reminded me, that I saw in a program one time, that when humans are first conceived, we are ALL exactly the same!!! It isn't until later in the pregnancy that the proper hormone is supplied, to change the fetus into a male. So ALL fetuses start off as female, to begin with, hence the nipples.|`|338147447c1fd07a8d20b6a04a40136aaa	titty twisters would be hard to do without them|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Because they don't want to feel left out.|`|j5U44juiaa	Because when first conceived, we're all girls.  The fetus doesn't become a male until much later in the pregnancy.  Not kidding!|`|wgm9ADfBaa	because were girls when we start out but a hormone turns them into boys|`|RdKL56AAaa	Well, when the human species were cavemen, the nipples were used to provide milk for the colony. Males lactated due to the fact that quenzin ugok, the God of justice, knew that the women were busy using their lactation to feed their young. The water supply was short and with quick thinking, men were granted nipples. At the time, male nipples were celebrated and cherished as women's are. Now, questions like 'why do guys have nipples?' are asked. Its a shame not enough people know about its history.|`|GlAS65rSaa	because when a girl gets tired of nursing the baby she passes the job on to the guy!
fpuHVNYgaa	burning while urinating,blood in your urine,urge to pee all the time.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Everybody is different and what one person feels doesn't necessarily mean that somebody else will feel the same thing. Although, common symptoms are feeling like you have to pee frequently, not being able to pee or only peeing a very small amount when you do go, having dark colored or cloudy urine, foul smelling urine, and a burning sensation when you pee. Usually you don't feel too much pain if you're not trying to pee. You do need to go to the doctor and get some antibiotics to make it go away. They can also verify that that is indeed what's going on. Don't ignore it. You need to get on medication right away so it doesn't turn into a kidney infection. I'm attaching a website with some more information on UTI's (Urinary Tract Infections, also known as bladder infections). Good luck and feel better soon!|`|XOgvpDiZaa	Burning, for one. This happens when you use the bathroom. If the infection makes it way up to the kidneys then you'll feel INTENSE back pain when urinating.|`|43c76acae3ae7f0e7879e211104c3473aa	Sometimes when you use the restroom it will feel like you have to go more then what comes out. Burning & deep pain in the lower abdomen & back. Drink cranberry juice & water, but most importantly don't ignore it. It could turn into something more severe if you don't get medical attention.  Good luck & I hope you feel better!|`|rRw9hReaaa	Your private will burn SUPER bad! and ur back will hurtt bad when peeing.
ndjSVHlxaa	Orgasm is a chemical release that is triggered by the brain.    So the starting point should actually be in your mind. In other words you need to get excited first. Think about a guy that you think is hot.    Then your juices will start to flow - be patient it might take 5 to 10 minutes. That will be the indication that your body is primed.    Then the next step is the physical stimulation.    Touch around the clit in the start. In circular motions.    When you feel even more excited (your heart beat will increase), then increase the rhythm and rub closer to the clit.    It will feel sensitive but keep going for about 3 minutes.    You will feel engergy building up. Keep going and then you will encounter the big 'O'.    Good luck!|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Almost all women need clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm.|`|IxYVHATXaa	You may not really be in the mood... Try to get really excited and then use the toothbrush on the clitoris, while maybe having a dildo of some sort inserted. Good luck
AA10718475	Do you lack of sleep?    or is somewhat anemic?    You can modify your sleep and diet for you to be more healthy.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	lots of possibilities. If you're missing any sleep that could be it. you can never REALLY catch up on sleep, so try to always get 8 hours of sleep. If you're upset about stuff, that can do it. You could see a counselour. If you just cut down on caffeine, or you could be depressed. Or getting sick. Unless it's for like 2 months after taking care of yourself, I wouldn't worry. Then talk to the doctor.|`|wveMibkGaa	sleep.
gxDR4eCQaa	Do what you can to take your mind off of it.  Get into a daily routine, eat at a certain time, sleep at a certain time, etc.  Make sure you're getting at least 7 hours of sleep every night. Going to bed before midnight is definitely a good idea.  Eat as healthy as you can/take vitamins.  Exercise when you feel stressed. Running/dancing/kickboxing are all really helpful.  Make sure you're eating pretty healthy too!  Good luck!|`|qbbNtGVcaa	i have the same exact problem! just make sure its not on your mind...i know its hard to say don't think about something when it has to be on ur mind haha. but it has to come soon. just don't have pads or tampons with you...maybe keep them in your car or locker..if ur still in school. and don't wear any before you get it!! that makes you think about it so much and it feels like it never comes if u do that haha    hope this helps :) good luck!|`|AA10302509	I realized worrying about it just makes it worse. Just wait for it to come, and don't think about it.

A C cup might look good, but I think life would be easier with a B cup (doing things when your boobs don't get in the way as much).  Maybe they will increase in size yet, you are only 16.  Also, you can use a push-up bra etc. to improve the appearance of your bust without surgery.  Good luck.|`|ShPHh6OTaa	Well you can either stuff your bra or have surgery.    But! there are some pills that you can take, and although they are pills, they arent steriods or anything. you can get them from holland and barrett, or other similar stores that sell health food.    Basically, what it does is naturally tell you body to start developing. I used to use them but forgot for about a year, thankyou for reminding me to continue using them lol.

UrUpWmA7aa	The easiest way to think healthy is really basic.  If it is processed, frozen or canned, and has a long shelf life, it is crap.    Real food comes from nature and has a short shelf life. eat fruits and vegies for 50% of your diet. carbs(bread/pasta) for 25%, and meat for 25%|`|DIRbVD5uaa	Nothing Probably  Besides the Fruit  Try packing a lunch. If your going to spend money on lunch make it count.|`|A2WPuEmMaa	I would try and eat healthy at the school. !f thats not possible try and bring some fruit or vegetables from home to eat at lunch. Or if you have the option of leaving your school for lunch go to someplace you know has healthy foods .. such as subway or arbys? i dunno if they have arbys where you are. The best choice for this would be to go to a place where they make the food in front of you and ask you what you want on it and such.. they tend to be healthier..
ByM5bvqsaa	Definitely not.    I was the skinny guy all throughout my teen years, my shoulders never widened, and gained muscle mass. I'm 20 now and I actually had to workout to see it happened|`|sipXnwifaa	It really just depends on genetics and also i guess you could call it luck?  Some people grow steadily until ages 18-21, others grow in spurts, and some just grow as tall as they can get at age 14 or something and then stop growing, and others are late bloomers and dont grow until they are 18.  Have you been growing steadily?  Have you started growing yet?  Have you had any spurts?  Answer these questions and then you might be able to find a pattern with a parents pubescent years.

For me when i am stressed i take a very long bath or shower, but that's me you find your own way.  Also before you eat look at the calories and fat your eating and then think about that and how nasty it is and how nasty it will make you.  Another technique is constantly reminding yourself of the goal your setting set a reward like when you get back down to that weight that you get a vacation or something.  The best one for you is think about your kids and the habits they will pick up from you if you eat when you get stressed and how you don't want that to happen.|`|mnmpZwcxaa	I had similar gain due to stress related to work and family issues. I found that just doing that extra cardio each day and reducing my intake has helped significantly. Once you get in a routine, it will be great! I also suggest taking a multivitamin since you will not be eating as much and need nutrients. Plus the one I take is liquid, and helps fight hunger, reduce stress and gives you the energy to get through your day! I posted my blog below if you would like to read more about health and wealth. I hope this helps.|`|33Ar7sOfaa	ugh I had the same problem and I gained up to 170 and lost 70 of it by being anorexic, then got back to a healthy 125 got pregnant gained all of it back + 2 pds. soo its been 4 months and I am at 130 and 135 its all on what you eat when you are craving food.. if you are hungry and its late eat salad or vegetables or 100 calorie popcorn... and eas sensible.. you can still have all that stuff just smaller portions and instead of breaded get grilled and try veggie burgers or steaks they're good soo if you do right.. you will lose it.. trust me
ByM5bvqsaa	Ummm yeah..    1 hour and 45 minutes is too much. You're overworking your muscles up to a point where they won't grow. Average is around 45 minutes depending if you're doing a full body workout or not. I've been lifting for awhile now and know that. If you go under Diet & Fitness section, people will tell you the same thing especially the certified/personal trainers.|`|NBf5q2f5aa	3|`|IwrS9zw1aa	as long as you plop,it alll good!!

Bc your crap being red has nothing to do with your period.  And red crap is a really bad sign of something internal.  I've heard that if that happens you should go to the emergency room  right away.    I would call your doctor first and see if it's really that serious first.|`|yuFH9FSRaa	your constipated..when was the last time you pooped? serious question on average you are supposed to poop 1-2 times daily.

Its actually a common disease called gastrofecetonis.|`|HUvlo4ppaa	No one on here is really going to be able to tell you what the problem is. Does the red in it look like blood or did you eat something red?    Certain foods can change the color,especially if you eat a lot of these particular foods. But I think maybe you should go see your doctor if this has happened more than once. Blood in your stool, or poop as you say, can be a sign of internal problems, which means you need to see the doctor immediately. Green generally means you have a lot of bile in your stool, which also is not good, but not nearly as bad as bloody stools. Go to the ER if you are truly worried, otherwise see your doctor.
OI3bf4yjaa	Don't worry, it will come eventually! But really, it isn't something to be looking forward too - it's actually hell, lol. Once you start to have brown discharge in your underwear .. that's a sign that your period is coming. However, just because you have brown discharge does not mean it will come right away. It could take years, months, weeks or days. You're only 12 - you have nothing to worry about. It will come sooner or later.|`|n6zqu8gKaa	you are going to get it you are still young so after you get pubic hair under your arms and on you vagina then you will probably get it that is how i was.|`|378GRzrnaa	some people dont get it until there 16.. im nearly 14 and havnt got mine.

V5xHaIAcaa	Technically almost everyone has a personality disorder to some degree or manifistation or another.    I would submit that you have one of the more serious forms.  I would suggest that for your own good you seek out a good phsychologist or psychiatrist.  If you are depressed (although you may not recognize it) you have a serious and dangerous medical condition that requires prompt attention.    One of the problems with depression is that it hurts you in ways that you do not recognize.  That is not a judgement, just an observation    Good luck - do not ignore the seriousness of the problem|`|2ZsXQIuwaa	hmm same here  except i'm not an addict to anything  i do have a tendency of saying some things that hurt people's feelings. expecially jokes. no one ever gets them and instead of laughing they frown or have that look when it says "gosh that hurts". it was a joke! and it hurts that they didnt find it funny at all.....    there is nothing wrong with you  there is something wrong with this world|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	It could be a personality disorder. It could also be that your poor behavior is because of the drugs and alcohol. Substance abuse can make people act just terrible.

It's treatable and you have the desire.|`|7YU9IreXaa	a lot of things  how about you stop looking for excuses and start acting like a normal human being you stupid ******* *****  god damn, it is so annoying that people like you just use mental illness as a crutch for you shitty attitude.  grow the **** up|`|z6ygHFmcaa	Def go talk to your doctor, it sounds like Borderline Personality Disorder, there is some help, I have it and you can get help though there is no cure.
ETcBRko3aa	Dude, how many times are you going to ask about this?????        CBT is a type of therapy that is used to change a persons thoughts.  It deals with the here and now, and does not so much focus on a person's past.  It teaches you how to change and thoughts and behaviors.

GQZteaMXaa	i feel sorry for you..... sounds like u have a naturally weak immune system, or your immune system didnt develop well enough when you were younger, im not sure if there really is anything you can do....except the bone thing sounds like your not getting enough calcium but id talk to your doctor before getting supplements or sumthing|`|C4AUC5vGaa	Your bone pain kinda scares me. My mom was always complaining of that. I thought she was crazy. She said it felt like her bones were being ripped apart. She was just diagnosed with lymphoma. No doctors believed her when she went in. She always seemed to be sick, so we were kind of sick of her complaining all the time. The doctors didn't really believe her.    Go get another doctor and push until you figure this all out.    Nobody should live with that amount of pain and sickness.    I hope you feel better quick.|`|S8F8Jralaa	First of all, you need to start looking for things that will cause problems to your body.  How is your diet?  Besides being allergic to everything under the sun, do you stay away from preservatives, artificial colors, sugar, diet products, soda?  Do you drink purified water?  Do you eat organic fruits, veggies and get enough fiber each day?    How about your home?  Any mold issues?  Do you have products in your home that contain bleach, ammonia, formaldehyde?    We had to do a lot of changes but they were worth to get our daughter healthy.  We went to 8 or 9 different doctors, did testing, tried their medicines but nothing worked for more than a day or two.  It wasn't until we went "all natural" that she got better.  Healthy Habits: 20 Simple Ways to Improve Your Health   by David J. Frahm, Anne E. Frahm    A great book to help you get started on a healthier life.    Also, we take vitamins with oligofructose compounding that helps build the immune system.    If you need more help contact me and I have tons of information about healthier living but it can be a fairly simple process when taken one at a time.  We did it all in about 2 months and it was the best decision we ever made.|`|NQqixUq7aa	Wow. Honestly I have really bad allergies too and bad lungs I keep getting bronchitis. For that their is this thing called RespirActin. It is a combination of herbs 17 to be exact and you drink 1/4 oz. of it a day.  I would honestly say you need to detox.  Maybe you have parasites because I do and I have many problems.  A lot of people don't know that but parasites cause many health problems and are mistaken for other things.  Like for your allergies you prob have high toxin levels. Because your lymph nodes are suppose to be cleaned out by your colon and if your colon is clogged it won't drain as well.  I would really suggest detoxing. It would solve many of your problems.  Your having these problems because your body has a overload of toxins.Get a good multivitamin and since your immune system is so low i would buy some herbal supplement to take to boost it up. some good herbs for this are ginseng, shiitake mushrooms, reishi, ashwaganda and astragalus.
1BbnyTfBaa	Your family physician should refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist; either is fine.    The p or p will either talk to you about your problems, or give you a paper and pencil test, or both.  Once they have decided what your problem is, they will write a report and make a recommendation for treatment.  If you have bipolar, they will recommend that you take medicine and see a therapist for talk therapy.  If you want to know what is in the report, ask  the person who wrote (or will write) it, or the person you see for talk therapy to explain it to you.|`|3mgYLfikaa	he'll probably ask questions.|`|sdFoawrIaa	most of the time they will send you to see a psychiatrist, to where they will talk with you and probably start you on some medications.  it is important that you continue to take the medications and work with them to help you.  it will take a little bit of time to get you to a correct and level place, but in the end it will be worth it.  i have a couple of friends that have gone through all of it.|`|7FNCi8fnaa	Medication. That's your answer. So many people are afraid of meds.  Why? If you could take something to give you a better quality of life, wouldn't you. There are so many out there, I'm sure you'll be a guinea pig for a liitle bit. Stick with it, eventually they will find what works best for you. Everyone's body is different. And try reading, watching shows on TV that make your mind work, not fantasy. Trust me. I know from experience.
JI00LaXxaa	First of all, how old are you? Judging from the question and your spelling you sound 12.    And no, if no sperm went inside she cannot get pregnant.|`|dc984b1152e1c34c8bdc149deb4dfc98aa	first of all, you should see a doctor and find out why she's having menstrual cycles that last 14 days!  i mean, that's gotta be some record, man.  i'd just play it safe and leave her alone!
kXFc00D9aa	Prevent: Wash face 2x daily with a mild cleanser (Cetaphil is a good non abrasive choice), use a toner (witch hazel works nicely), and use a moisturizer for oily or combination skin (when it comes to moisturizer skip the drug store and go with something a little pricier since that is what actually sinks into your pores- and remember if your skin is too dry your skin will produce more oil to balance the skin, so moisturizing is imporatant!)    Treat:  For occasional breakouts, spot treat with a product that has benzoyl peroxide in it such as "Zapzit" or toothpaste works nicely. Be sure to use a paste and not a gel. It works like a clay mask to draw it out and shrink it in size (You may want to do this overnight) Once a week you will want to steam your face by standing over a pot of boiling water and you can do extractions following that. If you are not comfortable with that...go see a dermatologist or esthetician.|`|p9TofJKBaa	i absolutely love clean & clears continuous control acne foam wash. followed by neutrogena's spot treatment-- no break outs or anything, i love it. but if you need to bring down a pimple in 2 hours, put an ice cube in a plastic bag and hold it on the pimple for 5 minutes at a time. i did this at work one day, and it disappeared! good luck :-)

ODR21UgYaa	No, it a very bad idea actually. Exercising and not eating is a very bad combination because you need your food for the right amount of energy to exercise. What you can do is cut back on your food intake, remove excessive amounts of junk food from your diet and replace it with fruits and vegetables, be sure to drink plenty of water and do not get too caught up on energy drinks because they contain a lot of sugar.|`|AgiwOGbUaa	First to the person who said eat 300 calories a day, that is starvation, and HORRIBLE.    Eat organic, and eat MORE every day, 5-6 meals! SMALLER meals at that! Portion is most important and keeping your metabolism up throughout the day at a steady rate is most important. If you eat in the morning and then don't eat until 6PM your body between 12 and 6 will save as much at as possible and eat your muscle. Just cut out any foods with things you can't pronounce, aspartame(soda!!), and any other unnatural sweeteners. If you eat things you put syrup on get blue agave nectar, much better than any maple syrup.     I have a protein bar called power crunch, they are not the best for you when it comes to protein bars but it tastes like cake! have one a day as a dessert if your tooth needs sugar!|`|INPmsZyKaa	yep thats the smart way to do this.|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	When you go on a no-eat diet, your body reacts to no food, then when you do eat, your body stores it as all fat as it thinks it is starving. Eat small portions every day of healthy foods, say 6 small meals throughout the day, and exercise and get yourself a personal trainer. This is a healthy and effective way of losing weight.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Eat LESS, eat good healthy foods, and exercise.|`|HT1Jb7zOaa	what you need to do is figure out a eating plan what your going to eat for the day breakfast lunch and dinner and ever healthy snacks fruit ETC    stick to it and do some walking something that will keep you moving will help you tone up and lose weight     when you don't eat what it does is eats at you fat when your not eating and when you eat it holds on to it because its not sure of when you are going to eat again trust me i tried it didn't work     if you have a healthy eating plan and make time to exercise you will do fine what will happen is that you will lose some weight and you will feel great then you will hover around the same weight then it will come off just hang in there don't give up    hope that helped|`|ZzXSITwmaa	no that is bad. you can damage muscle tissue and other vital organs|`|qcB23QvZaa	just eat like 300 calories a day|`|hBAG3u3paa	Yes of course! Just eat a little bit of food. After a while excercise!|`|e8BgKv8caa	no, mayb excerise, and go on a diet, but dont not eat, and also, you can eat anything you want, just in small portions.|`|ssiqDLKsaa	no that is anexeria just execrise or DIET instead but i will tell yo this anexria turns most girll OFF|`|AA11348638	The way to lose weight is simple unless you have a medical condition preventing this...eat a restricted calorie diet and exercise more.  Many websites can tell you how many calories to eat and still lose weight safely.  Not eating at all will just result in weight gain after you start eating again.  It's about lifestyle change and unless you are willing mentally to do it, it won't last.  Good luck and God Bless!!!|`|A1KwOUFCaa	By not eating for a while....yeah you might loose weight, but thats really bad for you. And as soon as you start eating again, you will gain all the weight again. I really think that you should eat healthy and exercise alot....trust me...it makes a huge difference.     Also you should write down everything that you eat in a day. That will help you keep track of what you eat and you can adjust it.     But I dont think you should stop eating at all.|`|4RLjQ4M4aa	don't stop eating! try this; only eat when you're hungry. eat things that are low in calories and fat. run a few miles every day (stamina builds up faster than you'd expect). drink a lot of water to flush out your system and try some ab excercises. negatives help. do a sit up and go down slowly for 5 seconds. good luck!|`|f7zjcfbAaa	No your body will go in to starvation mode you will do more harm than good|`|PM9YLHfTaa	ok, save yourself some time, I have put together a list of websites that work and will help you lose weight quick and effective.    http://weight-loss-camps-for-adults.blog...  http://the-weight-loss-systems.blogspot....

Also when you starve yourself your metabolism goes whack you may run miles and gain weight...    Just change your eating diet to a healthy 3 meals a day, don't serve yourself more than one plate at each meal and fill your plate with a variety of healthy food not fatty food.  Exercise 4 days out of the week also helps a lot if not more.|`|ZUCkh7dmaa	No. Tall anorexic guys arn't attractive, atleast to me. :) And 6"2 238 is a perfect weight, if you were 5"1 that would be a different story. Excersising isn't a bad way to loose some weight, but in my opinion you don't need to. Lay off the cupcakes and go take a mile walk with a friend once a week. It's a perfect way to slowly loose weight.|`|mnmpZwcxaa	Try more cardio and drink tons of water and cut your 2nd and 3rd meal down to almost nothing. Add a multivitamin to your regiment.

Check out my BLOG as there are some helpful hints and tips about multivitamin    Also, here is a site for a great liquid vitamin  www.shopgbg.com/351961|`|cmEsPTwoaa	First of all, do not stop eating.  When you stop eating, you're body readjusts to the decrease of calories you're taking in.  It burns calories slower to save you're energy.  So if you stop eating, you're just going to slow down you're metabolism.  You will have less energy, which is what you'll need to start exercising.  I suggest that you change you're diet and get a gym membership.  Losing weight can be tough, but if you have the determination and you follow a "game-plan," you can really make some progress.  I wish you the best!
AA11693263	Advil or Motrin or if you want to take a medication specifically for this then there is Pamprin or Midol. A heating pad can be your best friend to relieve cramps. I use mine every month :) And hot baths that you just lay back and relax in are quite relaxing and helpful too. So, take some medicine, put on your most comfortable pair of pajama bottoms and a big soft tee shirt, grab a heating pad and curl up in bed with a good book. You will get to the point when you are older when you will know when the pain is going to start and you will become a pro at knowing what works best for you to ease your pain.|`|tSZ7A1NPaa	I like to use Midol.

(This was back before we had Tylenol and Motrin.)  Aspirin didn't touch it.  Finally I started using a heating pad on the pain and it helped a lot.  Don't be afraid of menstrual cramps.  We all get 'em.    Now, if the 'belly ache' is above your waistline and in your stomach and not down below your waistline in your abdomen, then that's a whole other subject and usually not related to menstruation.  If those pains continue, you should talk to a doctor.
9XAf7jxaaa	Some aspects of this sound a lot like myself.  However, while I have dealt with this in a similar way to you in years past, more recently I have just acted falsely arrogant and cocky.  And it's not me at all.  Sure, you may have trouble socializing and have social anxiety disorder (which I have had since before the age of six, apparently I had it that badly), but it doesn't mean you are confined to the boundaries of anti sociality.  I think you are doing fine right now, and you could be acting like a stuck up, hostile prick like me.  The only way you can change this is to dig deep within yourself and find some confidence.  Know that you are just as good as anybody else.  With all the positive characteristics that every human possesses, there really is no reason for you to feel uncomfortable.  People are not always the judgmental losers they appear to be and will not be so quick to form some negative opinion of you.  If you can talk to your friends, then you can talk to anyone.  Not to sound superficial, but people are people when you get down to it.  Things will be rough, but as you go through it, you will become more comfortable around people.  Ease into it, and with every new person you get to know, it will keep getting easier.  Realize the things that make you unique and the good things about you, and ignore the flaw and insecurity that comes standard with being human.  It helps to remember that all people, in a nutshell, are probably just as insecure as you.  Yet they get past it.  As long as you stay confident, you really will do fine.  And most importantly, never lose yourself.  Always be the real you.  I have learned the hard way that no one wants some spurious facade.  And once you make it a habit of not being yourself, it is very hard to break.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com.

The process of Self Reflection has truly changed my life.heres my profile. http://www.letsreflect.com/profile.php?u...     The trick is staying positive and surrounding yourself with positive people.

Best of luck.|`|mg0u1w9Jaa	I was kinda in the same situation but I realized that if everyone stares at you when you talk to people outside your comfort zone they are staring at you because they actually care what you're saying, not to make fun of you or anything. Most people are really nice people so don't worry about it :) Just think "I don't care what other people think of me because I'll always have friend's and they'll help me". And your friends will support you :)    Edit post* Ya, I used to freak out too when they all stared but you just have to calm down and phrase your words carefully :) At least I have to phrase my words more carefully because I talk a lot and talk quickly so I end up tripping over my words a lot.|`|lUbT6womaa	I'm the same exact way.     Honestly, i think you should go talk to a counselor. They can help. They're helping me (along with Paxil).     Anxiety is a bear to deal with. I know where you're at. You will get better. Just know that you're not alone and don't be scared to talk to someone about it.

Some anxiety is normal for teens, it is just part of the process of becoming an adult and going through that change from being a child to becoming an adult. Being a teen was the most stressful time in my life.At times I was treated like a kid, and then told to grow up-talk about mixed messages.  I like the way you psych yourself up and tell yourself you are going to have a good day, that is very positive. If the anxiety is excessive there are none addictive drugs that a good psychiatrist can give you-Lexapro, Prozac, Paxil, Wellbutrin, Buspar are all good if the anxiety is overwhelming. Also talk therapy can be very helpful. God Bless Reggie. Hang in there it does get better. If you would like to chat read my profile and IM or email me

9ed48e03128fadf6393931a15386538daa	Ok honey! Yeah you will need synthroid for the hypothyroidism. Your Thyroid is the master gland, and as such I must tell you that lots of tests will be off until the thyroid is balanced out.     You will feel so much better after your thyroid is normal that even your "hypochondria" may fall by the wayside!    hypothyroidism can cause all kind of strange symtomes too:    What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism?    The symptoms of hypothyroidism are often subtle. They are not specific (which means they can mimic the symptoms of many other conditions) and are often attributed to aging. Patients with mild hypothyroidism may have no signs or symptoms. The symptoms generally become more obvious as the condition worsens and the majority of these complaints are related to a metabolic slowing of the body. Common symptoms are listed below:        * Fatigue        * Depression        * Modest weight gain        * Cold intolerance        * Excessive sleepiness        * Dry, coarse hair        * Constipation        * Dry skin        * Muscle cramps        * Increased cholesterol levels        * Decreased concentration        * Vague aches and pains        * Swelling of the legs    As the disease becomes more severe, there may be puffiness around the eyes, a slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, and heart failure. In its most profound form, severe hypothyroidism may lead to a life-threatening coma (myxedema coma). In a severely hypothyroid individual, a myxedema coma tends to be triggered by severe illness, surgery, stress, or traumatic injury. This condition requires hospitalization and immediate treatment with thyroid hormones given by injection.    Properly diagnosed, hypothyroidism can be easily and completely treated with thyroid hormone replacement. On the other hand, untreated hypothyroidism can lead to an enlarged heart (cardiomyopathy), worsening heart failure, and an accumulation of fluid around the lungs (pleural effusion).    So make sure to take your meds!  I am glad you have an endo to take care of you!    Good luck!|`|plwuZ0Kuaa	The Best thing I can tell you is the other response is right on. However there is help with your doctors .    First thing you need to do is regulate that thyroid and get the levels in check.     I give my mom this nutrition called Core complex and Nite Works . It works  to regulate the levels.   Are there any other health problems or allergies you have??  And if you are over weight use the Ultimate Plus Program also. You will be  feeling like a million bucks in no time. A friend of mine used the program and he is now also insulin free , this happened in 45 days no more diabetes ..www.healthshop4you.com|`|63c6ad890d0828ff609c53ea0a1378e0aa	Your going to need some thyroxine tablets. You will be surprised at how much better you will feel when you get your thyroid levels up to normal. I would be interested if you feel you can never get enough sleep, or are tired all the time. I always felt cold, when everyone else in the room was quite comfortable.  Your doctor will probably watch your tumor on your pituitary gland. Are you supposed to call him back for your test results? I would do so, the sooner you get some thyroxine in you the better. He will also give you your bilirubin results.  Good luck

It is just a wing of a regular, community hospital, nowadays, most of the time.  There are still some state hospitals, but they have mostly been closed, too (in our state they were made into 16 bed units, so it is more homey).      Most people take antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or antipsychotics. Usually people come in when they are in a crisis, and stay a week to 10 days, then go home.  Sometimes people have another issue, like they have another health problem, and need closer observation as their meds are changed, or they may have dementia or low IQ and need to be observed.
tbFI2XJeaa	Do specific strength training exercises that target the muscles that surround and support the knee. The stronger your muscles are, the less work and stress is placed on your knee joints. Exercises like squats, lunges and step-ups done properly are some of the best exercises. If you find these movements painful at first, limit your range of motion and the number of repetitions. Only squat and lunge as low as you can without pain. If you keep at it, your muscles will become stronger and you will eventually be able to go lower. Also, the wider you keep your feet, the less stress there is on the joint.

BMR is calculated based on height, weight, age, and activity.  Once you get your BMR (yours is 1886, by the way), you multiply that by a set number based on activity level.  Since you are moderately active, you multiply that by 1.55 and get the number of calories you should be ingesting each day to maintain your weight--2924.  However, to achieve weight loss, you incur a 500-1000 calorie deficit.    You should be ingesting anywhere from 1924-2424 calories per day.    On to your second question, 3500 calories is equal to one pound of weight loss.

Ativan? belongs to a class of drugs known as Benzodiazepines. Ativan? is the trade name for a drug otherwise known as Lorazepam.     This drug may have some interaction with St Johns wort either reducing its clinical effectiveness and or affecting its toxicity. It is important therefore that you do NOT take St Johns Wort at the same time as this drug. And I don't know what would need to be the lapse inbetween. If you want to try St Johns Wort then you need to talk to your doctor first so he can give you the green light which would most likely mean not taking Ativan? during the period you take St Johns Wort.     Drug-herb interactions between Benzodiazepines and various herbs, notably St Johns Wort, Kava Kava, Valerian and Milk Thistle.     From the Home Care Group website:  "Any individual using a benzodiazepine and considering using St. John's Wort as a substitute or as a means of weaning themselves from the drug should do so only under supervision of a trained healthcare professional. Caution is especially indicated given the potential for the amentoflavone component of Hypericum to inhibit the action of the benzodiazepine. "  http://home.caregroup.org/clinical/altme...    If the Ativan? is not working well for you or not as effectively as you would like and/or you would like to try an herbal alternative instead then please talk to your doctor first. Rhodiola rosacea may be a better choice as an herbal anti-depressant. Lemon balm tea may help with anxiety. But again talk to your doctor or a pharmacist first if you are on prescribed medication before taking any herbal supplement because of the potential for drug-herb interactions, including the latter I mentioned.  Though no drug-herb interactions appear to be documented for Rhodiola rosacea you need to double check with your doctor or a pharmacist first still.    Rhodiola rosacea at drugs.com:  http://www.drugs.com/npp/rhodiola.html    Best wishes.

1t7r2eE6aa	ok. I also take meds and I also decided to stop taking them on my own and the same thing happened. I started to feel unable to control my emotions. One minute I was fine, the next I wanted to kick someone in the face, the next I wanted to cry or scream.    I told my doctor and he told me that you should NEVER NEVER stop taking your meds unsupervised because you could have a STROKE.  The dizziness is due to the lack of meds. I started to feel like I could barely walk without grabbing on to something.    DEFINITELY tell your doctor when you see him wednesday because you have started whats called weaning yourself off. He may need to start you back up on a lower dose.     Also be aware that once you start back on the meds again it will take a few days to start to feel normal again. The body has to have time to get the meds into your system.    And beyond all of the medical stuff, dont feel embarassed or upset about having a chemical imbalance. There are so many peope out the that talk sh!t but they are ignorant. I think that like 75% of the people I know that arent on meds should be! So if someone you know talks crap about that then just dont tell them. Its not their business anyway.    Feel better sweetie and feel free to email me if you want to.|`|w69QiAqOaa	im on lamictal for bipolar disorder. without them i am flipping psycho! go on them!! there are other ones if you dont like the ones you are on at the moment.|`|e3eed8e1848cf66173578a71330925b5aa	plz take it,and dont feel embarrassed ur condition is due to chemical unbalance in ur brain,it isnot ur fault ans see the drugs as a way to restore the balance  take it|`|sdFoawrIaa	yes you should start taking your medications again, because they are keeping you at a balance point.  even though you may be feeling better while on them, doesn't mean you should stop either.  it can have very bad issues for you later on if you don't start taking them again.  also when you see you doctor advise him that you stopped taking them.|`|jrWm0wM8aa	You should really go back on your meds because if you don't then your experiences just get worse and like in my case family won't be able to deal with you. Your meds are supposed to help you function in life. Just try to go back on your meds for alittle while and see if it helps and if it doesn't, tell your doctor that your meds aren't working then they can try something else instead of isolating you on these meds. There's so many combinations that you can try. Just don't give up on your meds. Also therapy helps if you're not already doing that. And it gives you another resource beside Yahoo Questions.|`|4YHlEurYaa	u r going though withdraw symptoms that y u feel so bad. If u have been on meds for a while and just stop the chemicals have to work out of ur body that's the withdraw. if u want the crappy feeling to end either wait it out till ur over the withdraws or get back on ur meds. i think u should go back on ur meds i no a person who is bipolar and she stopped taking her meds she had withdraws for a while then was fine but she is a real witch because of her mood swings form the bipolar.|`|rBVg0tJgaa	Speaking as someone who has bipolar and takes an assortment of meds I know it can seem like a hassle to take your meds, but we have to. Maybe the meds you were taking weren't the right combo. I would urge you to speak with your Doc on Wednesday, let him know your off the meds and that you feel like you should be taking something else. I would also recommend therapy if you're not already doing so.     Your lack of ambition and the terrible feelings you have, could be from not taking the meds and not talking to someone about the feelings you are having.     I was hospitalized for not taking my meds in over 5 months because my moods were up and down. I felt worthless and hopeless. It wasn't until I broke down to my husband that I realized I needed some help.  Getting back on meds and seeing a therapist has really helped me this time around. Don't give up, there is a combo of meds out there for you that will work.
5ad5598dc77782773e361b3821253d4eaa	Actually, it is my belief, that you experience a state not unlike death every night when you sleep. Death is complete unconsciousness with total loss of your will. That happens every night in sleep as you do not have the power to awaken yourself but depend on another (like your spouse or mother) to awaken you, an alarm clock or some oother artficial noise or your natural unwilled chemical circadian rythms to bring you back to life. It always happens that you awaken so it may be when actual total death occurs. You might then awaken in some oother place with a new body. Do not fear death; it is natural and absolutely necessary for there to be life.|`|34tNnzQ7aa	You CAN die... I don't know what you mean by "experience" it...|`|kwYxQp0Maa	only once...

XFVUejr4aa	Exercise works really well in shortening your period and it also helps with the fatigue and cramps. Birth control is another way but skip the placebos if you taking the pill sometimes this can make you skip your period which usually makes then next one long and more intense.|`|MhpccWpmaa	Get on the pill. I had the same problem, I never knew when my period was going to come and when it came it was for 7 days straight and really heavy bleeding.  I got on the pill about four years ago and it works miracles with these problems. You always know when it's going to come and mine only lasts 4 days now usually and is pretty light|`|AEAxZEveaa	well, you could look into some of the contraceptives. There are some pills that are known to make it lighter, and I've heard depo provera sometimes makes it go away. Do you have heavy periods too? I used to have extremely heavy periods and I'd bleed for like 12 days at a time. I remember my mom asked me when I was 13 how long my periods were and I told her and she responded "no that's not possible, you must've counted wrong". I never mentioned it again! In my 20's, I found out that it was because my thyroid wasn't functioning. Now they're like 5 days and a normal flow. Ask your doc if they've ever checked it and have them tell you the level. There are vast differences in the way doctors look at thyroid levels. Let me know if you have any questions.|`|dGFrmyv5aa	Birth control pills. They do make it lighter and wear pads.  You'll have shorter periods with them than with tampons.    Birth control pills are like Yaz, Yasmine, etc.|`|Q8etYn60aa	Definately birth control.  You can go on a variety of different kinds.  There are of course pills, but now they have certain types of vaginal inserts, skin patches, or even shots.|`|wgm9ADfBaa	birthcontrol|`|IXAq7uQsaa	tablet tranzamine|`|nKEKG0Cqaa	birth control|`|0oRSnsrwaa	Some women find birth control shortens and regulates their cycle.|`|b6afb07e17db139c29f0e94c8a82d683aa	Ask your gynecologist about the options...but birth control pills are very effective in controlling your length and how hard your flow is. You should get a full exam to make sure there is not more going on..such as endrometriosis.  Good luck!
kGsRFXRhaa	It depends on what they are looking for and how easily they see what they are looking for. I had one done for a cyst on my ovary and she had to take a bunch of different pictures for several different angles because the cyst was so huge...so it took about 15-20 minutes. Which i think is a pretty standard time for any ultra sound. It all depends on what they find though. It doesn't hurt or anything and it's only a little awkward for obvious reasons but the technicians are professionals and they do that everyday, so they make it not such a big deal.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I have had that done a few times.  It doesn't take very long at all.  Maybe 5 minutes or so once they get the test started?    Do you have to have a regular ultrasound done first?  If not, you won't have to drink all that water.....    They actually hand you the probe that they use and let you insert it so it's most comfortable.  It is not very wide or thick but it is long enough that the technician just touches the other end of it to move it around a bit.   I have had a male technician twice!   And a female once.  They were both very caring and careful.  It sounds a lot worse than it will be!    Good luck to you!|`|el8yX5q3aa	I had this done when I had cancer and they had to do one.  It is painless..and it takes about 5 to 10 minutes.      It is like a small microphone...    http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&sa=X&...    Go here...the first thing on google are pictures of it.|`|lM7xPQg0aa	call the place where you will be having the ultrasound at and ask them your questions they will tell you how long it takes, what is the procedure or if you have to prepare yourself in any way|`|wXaGIPSPaa	Its easy. It doesnt hurt.  ANd Id rather have one of them than a pap smear!  Relax. Things will go fine.  The more you worry the more tense your muscles get and then its harder to just kick back.  Start imagining you are at the beach walking in the sand and  you are finding rare pirate ship coins along the way.    You may want to google ultra sound scan pictures though so you have an idea what you are looking at cause most doctors turn the screen so you can view it too.    Anyhow, you will have so much more knowledge about your self and alot o f information from this scan. Its a great advancement for women.  take care, have faith in your doctor, trust you instincts, relax and dont make problems before they are there.

Do cardio in the morning to burn fat. What most women don't realize is that if you only eat one meal a day, your body stores all the extra calories as fat because it doesn't know when it will get energy from next. Don't do a silly diet of cabbage, lemon or whatever else. Your body needs a full range of vitamins, minerals and protein to function properly. You want to SPEED UP your metabolism and frequent meals does that.     And you can't lose weight too fast or it gets unhealthy. Besides, women are supposed to have curves.     also, drink a full glass of water in the morning as soon as you wake up to just start your metab.     Stay healthy:)
nLScNIekaa	its prolly just muscle spasms i get em all the time
CGwdcAR4aa	well i am 21 and i am the same height. i am in the process of loosing my pregnancy weight and i know a healthy weight range for that height is 99-120ish pounds. I also had the same breast issue and I must say for her age that is awful. She will end up just like I was at age 20 with size 44F and in pain. There is not much you can do for her at this age because she isnt done developing. My guess is when she is old enough 16+ that you should consider a breast reduction. That is what I had almost a year ago and I am down to a 40C and still shrinking. Hopefully this helps you. There is nothing wrong with your daughter she is just blessed at an early age. Be careful when she starts middle school and high school because from experience her chest will be a hot topic. This can greatly effect her self esteem as it did mine. As far as her weight, double check with her doc because at 10 it may be a little high but for her height it is okay.|`|tFoSy2YRaa	OK, she mustn'y be wearing a 36. She would have to be somewhat overweight for her age to have to wear a 36. She should be wearing something like a 32. the band has to support her breasts properly. Just because she's got big boobs it does NOT mean the band size has to be big too.Look on these websites for bras in her size and fitting tips:    http://www.figleaves.com/us/home.asp    http://www.bravissimo.com/perfectfit/    Everybody develops at a different age, she's just early. her height and weight is absolutely fine.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	She's a 36 DD and she's only 10?? Her weight isn't that healthy for her height either.|`|z0fomFCfaa	Noooooooo expressly if shes 10|`|XgwGxdb3aa	oh honey, it doesnt matter what someones bra size is. for example im a 32a and im almost 14! that is 0 nada zip zelch ZERO boobs. do you think it matters. everyone develops differently. dont worry about it.|`|FcAK2gsOaa	She seems a bit overwieght for her height/age combo, but we would need a picture to determine that based upon on HOW muscular  [but i know you wouldnt want to post a pic on the net of her]
GMfPmHC4aa	No, I recommend that you just simply cut back on the things you are eating , such as chips, soda, fries any fast food, or candy . work out 6 days per week and I guaranteed you will lose that weight. good luck!!!|`|GaZscBiBaa	No, there is no way. Exercising burns of calories and is good, but it doesn't burn off as much as you eat and if you want to lose weight then you need to diet too. It's not like you have to eat everything fat free just watch your portions and try to eat healthier.|`|XRldviFPaa	No, that's not possible. Not just with working out, but you don't necessarily need to go on a diet, just improve your current diet. Eat healthier foods and smaller portions, and eat less junk food.   It's only possible to lose 2 to 3 pounds of fat a week. If you loose any more weight in a week, you're losing muscle.   By the way, if you start loosing weight and gain some back, that's from working out. That's muscle, and that's a good thing.     Hope that helps :)|`|MpTZjdLJaa	not it cannot
AA10718475	Could be related and could be not, let's keep our hopes up that it is just a mild problem. its better to keep your fingers crossed and wish for the better.|`|73458eadba0f98a5aadf5ddb0b5dc1ceaa	It could definitely be related to her ear surgery. Maybe there is an infection which can affect the brain since the ear is in such close vicinity to the brain. The best thing to do is stay calm and be there for her no matter what the doctor says.
6ix7aBSRaa	Well, if you give him good sex, it should be enough for him to ejaculate. It's not really difficult for us to do that, but it is for you girls. He must hit your G-spot consistently to make you blast. That could be from good penetration or if he licks you the right way. However, most of the time, a girl won't even blast when those things are done right; it just depends on the situation.    You will feel it, since every girl I know has told me how it feels when they have one.|`|qzpQdJ44aa	Google about masturbation techniques for guys and girls and follow the tips.

5f75de4cef16ee724cdcb0a718bf76a3aa	It may be a normal variant. You can Google "genu varum" but I don't think it is necessarily that. Blount's disease is a mild to moderate deformity of the upper tibia that causes the signs you mention. Finally, there's rickets, a disease we rarely encounter these days. It may result from a kidney disease or from a diet lacking in Vitamin D.     I doubt from your description that it is serious, but really, you should discuss your concerns with your doctor who has first hand knowledge of your situation.|`|rDsKB0uXaa	what do you mean inwards?|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Depends on what you call a defect.  It is called being knock kneed.
RXI8ImdIaa	There's nothing to stop the itching. This is why I don't shave body hair.

I recommended using shaving cream for sensitive skin, as that might help reduce itching.  Also, refrain from touching shaved areas for like, a day or so, otherwise it can get irritated faster.
AA11994092	If you need to ask this question than I presume you already know the answer is unequally YES. not the tobacco ,but the NICOTINE in the tobacco. Once addicted to it,,,it is a very hard addiction to get off of.|`|AuvMZYTSaa	They CAN be addictive, but less so that cigarettes.    Cigarettes are nothing more than nicotine delivery systems - cigar makers have admitted even adding nicotine to their filler.    While nicotine is naturally ocurring in tobacco, much of it is sweated out during the fermentation process when curing the leaf for cigars.      Cigars are smoked for flavor and aroma and were never meant to be inhaled.  Smoked improprly - i.e. inhaling, they can be addictive.    As for being labeled a drug - no.  However, if you mean for insurance purposes, if they test for the presence of nicotine use, it will show up|`|CAOXP7k6aa	Cigar tobacco typically doesn't contain nearly as much nicotine/additives as commercial cigarettes do, so they aren't addictive in the same sense as cigarettes.     They do contain nicotine though, so YES THEY CAN BE ADDICTIVE. But the amount of tobacco needed to be smoked to attain a nicotine buzz as a cigarette is usually too much for most people to inhale. Not to mention 'inhaling' isn't really the intended way for smoking cigars.|`|2vsjUqp7aa	They are basically the same as a cigarette. That's as simple as it gets :S

kiKB7tdaaa	A little. Don't panic though, if you'd like to get in better shape, just get some physical activity in. For example, instead of using free time to watch 2 hours of TV, try watching 30min-1hour of TV and spending an hour taking a walk, going for a bike ride, ect...     On top of that, cut out some junk food (including soda/fast food). Only eat it 1-2 times a week, and make the rest of your meals healthy, like fruit and veggies, whole grains, low fat dairy (skim or 1% milk), ect..|`|DeArSCNlaa	Yes you are slightly overweight. (I'm 5 foot 4" and weigh around 8lbs lighter than you!). You can lose weight by swimming, cycling, any form of exercise (at least 1 hour per day), and eating healthily and having a balanced diet.
AA12374808	It depends on the type of vision correction you require and whether or not you have astigmatism.|`|AA12341814	No eye, dear|`|150600a9aa8556f843640e03d9f67439aa	WEEL I THINK IT DEPENDS ON UR EYES   BUT I THINK LASIK IS BEST EYE SURGERY|`|AA11107363	I had PRK surgery, and my doctor did one eye one week and the other eye the next.  My eyes took about five days to heal each, so even though I had the surgery on a Friday I missed about 7 days of work total over the two weeks.  I had to have PRK because I had had corneal injuries in the past, so if you have ever had eye injuries you should definitely tell your doctor so he or she can determine if you can have LASIK.  My doctor also told me that because PRK has been around for about 20 years, the technique is a little more precise, but this was 6 years ago so there might be no difference in accuracy now, especially if you have an experienced doctor.    If you have LASIK, the healing time is something like 48 hours, so that's a definite plus!  They are both really miracle surgeries, though, it really comes down to how much time you want to take off of work.|`|d504abdb3478f6f7548cd74d336aae99aa	honestly, I don't think that either has been around long enough...we don't know what will be the long term effects....they basically thin your cornea....what will happen in 20-30 years after having it done?  We don't know.  Also, there are many diseases which would make laser surgery a contraindication.  Many of these diseases show up later in life....then you already have had the surgery and suffer the consequences (i.e. severe dry eye).  Talk to your optometrist.  Maybe try contacts instead!  There are many new lenses that have come out in the last few years that are great!|`|3aef5e21d122ab9727095b5d2c2ba774aa	Both are equally good procedures but you should discuss the risks  and benefits of both with your surgeon prior to the surgery.
AA10243205	It depends on whether you're a night person or a morning person.  Other than that it's personal preference.  Few people who work a day job have time to work out in the morning.  Having an extensive workout before breakfast isn't possible. Working out when you are not fully awake may trigger cardiac arrhythmias.|`|AA11301029	exercising in the morning helps get your metabolism revving first thing to keep you energized all day.  eat breakfast and exercise.  if you feel okay, you can exercise before breakfast, but you may not have the energy to exercise as long.  exercising in the evening keeps your metabolism revving through the night, but try not to exercise too late.  the best exercise routine is to exercise for 30 minutes in the morning and after dinner.|`|AA11702278	The pros of exercising in the morning is if it a aerobic type of exercise it will get you going, charges you up so to speak and you don't want to do that before bedtime. At night you could do something like stretching, yoga or tai chi to help you relax and sleep better.|`|AA11350053	Morning is better. It jumps starts your metabolism and keeps it going all day. It wakes up your body and helps it to function well. It gives you more energy in the long run. Sometimes exercising at night will wake up your body and it's harder to rest after your body has been moving, therefore you get less, restful sleep.|`|AA12315596	Exercising in the morning is better at burning fat because before you eat breakfast you will have gone six to ten hours without having eaten anything, which is normally the longest part of the day we go hungry.  After that long insulin levels are very low and thus hormone sensitive lipase is active and working to cleave triglycerides inside fat cells and putting the fat into the blood where the muscles can burn it.  If you exercise when your insulin levels are high (while drinking a sugary soda, etc) you will only burn sugar, not fat in your muscles.  Also you can speed up hormone sensitive lipase by drinking a beverage that has caffeine but no sugar, such as a diet soda or black coffee.|`|AA10944399	i exercise at night so that when i go to bed i just fall there and usually fall asleep faster

That is what it means.    Such as; now put this in your pipe and smoke it.

Although the origin of this expression is not known for certain, it is generally believed that it developed from the widely held concept that pipe smokers are thoughtful and/or contemplative.

AA11938604	One thing you might be able to do is suspend yourself somehow so that your feet don't touch the ground.  Then try to raise you knees to your chest or kick your feet as high up and as far in front of you as possible.|`|AA12044740	All you need to do is curl upwards to from the middle of your back upwards is off the ground - your lower back should stay on the ground.  I find it easier if I interlock my fingers behind my neck but it really doesn't matter what you do with your hands as long as you don't try to lift your head more than your back goes cos you can strain your neck.  But don't stress if you're not strong enough to get high off the ground for starters. The important thing is that you're working your stomach muscles which you can do just by tensing them. Then as they get stronger you can do it for longer & you'll get strong enough to do a full stomach crunch :)|`|AA12056471	why dont you try by strengthening your abdominals isometrically.  Lay down on a padded mat on your back, and tilt your pelvis upwards toward your head.  This action will contract your rectus abdominus and you can hold this contraction for 10 seconds.  This is what you would call a posterior pelvic tilt.  Do 8-12 of these, 3X per day,and see how you feel.  Once you get  the hang of this, you can increase your reps, then you can progress to a crunch when you gain some strength in you abdominals, and rotate your upper torso, incorporating your deeper abdominal muscles that run diagonally.  I hope this helps.

AA11436624	Yes its possible. In fact, its a very intense experience. Some people never achieve it because instead of relaxing and letting things flow and enjoying the moment, they are constantly thinking what to do to achieve it. In addition to that, you need someone that connects not only to your physical side very well, but to your emotional side as well. The anal game is very simple, but you need to be mentally prepared for it, meaning not being afraid of not only exploring that side of your sexuality but to discover and try new possibilities, plus zero issues (if its a dirty thing and else).

AA10332096	First I want to say that I personally do not think there is anything wrong with it.  It is better for you than smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol.  It is much less impairing than alcohol also.  I smoke it daily.  Well, medical mj anyway...which is the same thing only my doctor and the law say it's ok for me to smoke it.  Ok, the big deal according to 'the man' is that it is a 'gateway drug' meaning that the high from it will make you want bigger and better highs and you will start using stronger drugs.  It makes you eat, it makes you tired and it makes you forget things.  However, I think that the government keeps it illegal for reasons of money.  Yes if it was legal they could tax the hell out if it and make money that way, but not as much money as they make from it being illegal.  It all boils down to money....always!|`|AA12206411	it is illegal .|`|8a6020d793d06c35cf2f8551aadc51ffaa	Its a medicine.

7369e92ff71a93320f08912bc0950daaaa	The human mind is an interesting thing indeed.  The thing you need to remember is that we have the capacity to imagine things that don't exist, which is why we're able to invent.  The brain stores information as memory, but sometimes that information gets pushed to the back, so to speak.  When we sleep, the brain scans these old memories, and at the same time our imagination is active and so what we end up seeing is a blend of real experiences and made up images.  You may see someone your recognize as a friend, because your brain is scanning memories of friends, but they may look like a fish flying through outer space, because your imagination is blending into the memory.  Because sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell are all interpreted by the brain from electrical impulses your nerves send, when the nerves aren't active (while you sleep), your brain interprets memories and imagination as actual signals sent from your nerves.  That's why it all seems real, and why when you wake up it can be recalled so vividly, as though you experienced it before.  They are not, however, recollections of "past lives".|`|03056dd710e71fb95c24283fdf3654b9aa	Well, I think yer concentrating on such a minor subject unless u want to be a pyschiatrist or psychologist.

As far as finding blood on the TP when you wiped, that is normal if you are on your period.  If you have not had a menstrual cycle prior to finding blood on your TP and after finding this you have not seen anymore blood then i would suggest you see a doctor.   If you have seen more blood since finding it on yout TP, I would say it is safe to assume you have started your menstrual cycle.   Take care of yourself sweetie.

b952814605e06f55d64fe33e9507812eaa	Phentermine does not work for any substantial weight loss.  I asked my doctor to prescribe them to "jump start" my weight loss.  I paid a $30.00 co-pay for the visit and $45.00 for a months supply.  The pills caused terrible emotional side effects and I was down right cruel to my kids one morning.  After all that... I gained 4 pounds by the end of the thirty day period!  My doctor told me that only 20% of undermine users lose more than 5-7 pounds!!  Certainly not the 60 I was looking to lose.      Since then I have gotten serious and determined about weight loss and have lost 25 pounds by eating right as much as possible and exercising.  This has not been easy since I was diagnosed with degenerative osteo-arthritis in my knees and I can't run anymore.    Do it the right way.  I feels better and the results last longer.  If there really was a magic pill to drop the weight no one would be obese.  I promise you we would beg, borrow, or steal to buy it.    FYI, it works because it is an amphetamine.|`|bf90eb2a5d43c9a10aeef0dff6c88d73aa	yes but its only good to use short term to jump start a weight loss program.|`|fe27e112941a1bcfa5129d17e5336cf1aa	dnt go on pills always go natural they come with side effects|`|AA11347576	Well I used Phenteramine and sure I lost weight but after I lost about 15 pounds I quit taking it and guess what, I am trying to figure out how to lose those 15 pounds again.

I have taken it twice to jump start a weight loss program. The only problem is after about 3 months it stops working and you start eating again. It has been a wonderful drug to start working out, but now I need to find something to go further out...  I guess I need to work on my will power.  As someone who has tried everything on the market short of surgery to loose weight I can tell you that hard work and discipline is the only way that works perfectly.    And, when you are working out & eating right, you have more energy and feel more confident. You are happier and all areas of your life improve....

AA10627705	Sometimes PCOS can be a suspected diagnosis based upon physical symptoms.  However, if you think you have it, then it is extremely important to have blood work done.  PCOS does put you at high risk for diabetes, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, and other problems.  The majority of women who have PCOS also have insulin resistance, which means that your body does not use insulin as well as it should, and that can develop into diabetes.  You would need to have your hormone levels checked, and also be checked for those other problems.  Hypothyroidism also can cause some symptoms that look very similar to PCOS, so you really need to have your thyroid hormones checked too (via a blood test).  Think of it as an opportunity to face your fear of needles.  No one likes having blood taken, but it's something that we all have to do sometimes to make sure we're healthy.  You just have to find a way to cope with it.  I think it's easier to look the other way while they're taking blood.  The nurses can also use smaller needles that don't hurt very much for some tests.  You can ask them if they can use a "butterfly" needle, which is very thin and much less painful.  They understand that lots of people hate needles.    Masturbating does not harm your health.  There is no way that it is causing your symptoms.  The idea that masturbation causes health problems is just old superstition.|`|c6051428a5c680a820a4684731a420beaa	My sister has PCOS and anemia.

If you cannot think of any experience then it is possible that you might have some anxiety.  If you continue to experience this intense feeling of anxiety contact your primary care physician.  It may have also been based on what you last watched on TV before going to bed.  You can eliminate these feelings by not watching the news or an intense show close to your bedtime.|`|bf90db232417378d33a964b456740e65aa	I think ur peranoid.

It is the teens choice.|`|5ca87ade633b117568bc99352105cf35aa	The most common booster shot is the Tetanus or TD.  Another could be the Hepatitis A or B, either way they go on either the left or right upper arm in an area called the deltoid.  It is a muscle.  If it is an MMR booster, that goes in the fatty part in the back of your upper arm, the needle is smaller and shorter as it doesn't need to travel as far to reach the muscle.   Hope this helps.

Go to the doctor and get a diagnosis.  In the mean time, try to figure out what's triggering it and avoid that.  Make sure you eat regularly, avoid harsh things such as loud noises, chemicals, bright flashing lights, doing any one thing for long hours, etc.   A headache can be an allergic reaction, from stress, from sitting in one position too long, eye or muscle strain, hunger, you name it.  Just try to figure out when you are getting the headaches and you will eventually find a pattern. Then tell your doctor.  My best remedy is the one of everything, but that is a last resort and I doubt any medical professional would agree with me. Exedrin might relieve it. Or you could try one aspirin (for the blood vessles) one tylenol (for the headache) one ibuprophen (for the muscle ache) and one allergy type med (benadryl relieves allergies, tension, helps you sleep, sometimes treats the nausea some people get.).  If it's real bad I take a dramamine instead of a benadryl.  It is also an allergy med but most people don't know that.  Drink a full glass of water and a cup of coffee with it.     I also ice my neck and forehead.  Heat can work on sore muscles, but if it's not just sore muscles it will make it worse after awhile.  Good luck.|`|AA10310496	Drink lots of water as you may be dehydrated.    Hope it clears up soon!|`|AA11850523	drinks lots of water ( if not nauseated)  It could be a sign of dehydration  or contact a MD for further assistance|`|73144bf4d52ef032f09724f1cbccd53faa	get motrin.  it really works.|`|0acd751aa7cac8cbb8b077baa104ac81aa	The best recommendation that I can give you is at the very first sign of a migraine headache take your Excedrin, Motrin or Advil, (whatever you usually take for a migraine except Tylenol because it won't help with a migraine).  Allergy and cold medication will NOT help.  Don't wait until it gets worse because then its too late.  Try a hot washcloth to your forehead or ice, whichever you prefer.  I prefer cold because the heat makes me more nauseous, but my mom prefers heat.  Lay down where its cool and dark and try to get some sleep.    If you are dehydrated the headache can mimic migraine so drink lots of fluid.  You may try something with caffeine in it because this will shrink the blood vessels in your brain, migraine headaches increase the size of the blood vessels.    A lot of times these are triggered by your hormones coming on just before your period and maybe just before the end of it.  Also the birthcontrol pill can cause them as well as wine, cheddar cheese, chocolate and other foods.    If you keep getting them such as a couple times a week, not a couple times a month, then seek help from your Dr.  Hope you don't get too many of these ugly headaches.  Take Care|`|AA12056471	Put your feet into a hot tub of water (hot as you can stand, without burning yourself),  while  putting cold wet wrung out towel around your head.  Re-immerse cold towel in cold water when it starts to warm up.  What you want to do is create vasoconstriction in the head and vasodilation in the lower part of the body, by drawing blood away from the head.|`|AA11183346	Rub your head againt someone elses head it should make the head ach go away.. or check to see if you have cavities cause if you do then thats whats causing it.
