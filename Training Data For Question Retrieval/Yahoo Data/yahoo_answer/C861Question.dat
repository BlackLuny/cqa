20090205083935AAljQpk	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I need some real estate advice. Can you help answer this?	WE live in Canada in a rather large country home on 3 acres about 20 mins from the core of the city.  Our upstairs is totally unfinished, no insulation, just a big wide open space - about 1500 sq ft. We would like to finish one half side and rent it out as a 1 or 2 bedroom apt but we have no money.      My husband and I are not greedy people so making money off our renters is not a priority.  We just would like to finish part of it and get our heat under control for our family downstairs.        I have tried to think of every possible creative idea. WE have no extra money and there's little equity in our home.      Is there anyone out there have any really crazy or creative ideas how we could make this happen.  We're open to anything.  Family is not possible - they have no money either.

20080707163043AAouHen	Business & Finance;Small Business	Where can I find work on a daily basis?	Hi there. I am in Newport News VA, and I am looking to suppliment my income as an ops manager on my days off with some day labor. I called the agencies and they say that pay starts at 7 per hour. Yeah right. Anyway, I have looked everywhere I can think of: Craigslist, carreer builder, newspapers, online classifieds, and friends. No one seems to know where I can go to work for the day, and be paid decently for my time and hard work. Do people still hang out in front of home depot and get contractors to hire them for the day? I guess I could do that. Any help anyone can offer is greatly appreciated. I want to buy a motorcycle, and I would really rather not be paying high interest on a loan, or waiting 5 months starving myself to get the money I need. Thanks again.

20070605081534AA2pcmQ	Business & Finance;Credit	Who can help?	I have a good credit, was never late for any payment and I did purchase a home in November of 2005. With the hope that I was going to get home equity, refinance and get money to pay my debits, I realized later that it wasn't going happen because of the bad property value market for sellers in Massachusetts today. The house was purchased for 420K and the current appraisal is about 390K. Well, that said, I need to act soon. Since things didn't work the way I planned, today I owe 24K in credit cards, 7K in school loan, 9K in auto loan, and 5K in other loans (total about 45K) an average of 1K of minimum payment per month and my mortgage payment is 3,200 per month. The other services bills such as oil heat, water, sewer, electricity, phone etc. sums up to 1K per month. I feel that everything is out of control. Also, I have a family member that's really ill right now and he's living with me. My job is not profiting as it should and my salary has been cut down a bit. I make now 1K per week after taxes which hasn’t been enough to live normally anymore, and I haven’t mentioned food and other normal life expense such transportation. I had some cash reserve that I was able to keep payments up to date. Now I have an average of 6.2K of bills per month and I earn 4K per month (2.2K per every month behind). Since 2000 I have never delayed one single bill payment, but now that the cash reserve is gone I’m really afraid what’s going to happen from here on. What can I do in this situation: Short Sale, Foreclosure, Debit Consolidation, bankruptcy? Please help!

I went home and sent her a thank you email.  I called yesterday (6 days later) and spoke to the manager who interviewed me and she transfered me to HR where I left a message.  The HR recruiting person (person who set up my interview and greeted me at the door) has sent me an email that simply stated "Thank you for your follow up phone call. We are still conducting interviews for the position and we will let you know when a decision has been made. Have a nice day."  Now I feel this is the time just to stop contact and let them make a decision as Ive done all I can do.  However, should I reply to this email and just say thank you? Or is this too much? Advice please.  Thanks in advance.

I'm now looking for a part-time job and have some good prospects but my income will be much lower.       I bought my condo in Sept 2008.

20090205105758AAdI1eQ	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I live in Hawaii, and I'm having some trouble getting my ex roommate to pay up on his last month of rent?	Myself and 2 others are on a lease for a house here in Maui.  Two of us are going to stay and live in the house, and one is moving out as of the middle of last month.  He left me a note on the 16th saying he was moving out, and will help with Feb rent, not that he has a choice because you have to give 30 days notice here, and as far as I know he is still on the lease to this day.  Now it's time for him to pay his feb rent, but he hasnt.  He said he would go to the property mgr and pay her himself.  He is on the lease, so he is legally obligated to pay, but the property mgr says we have to pay his share if he doesnt, and then take it up with him to get our money back.     So what I need to know is, how do I make him pay?  I'm guessing I have to go after him legally, but I have no idea what to do, and my property manager isn't helping, is that illegal too?  Is she supposed to help me go after him?   Please help!! Im struggling here!  I don't have the money to cover his rent!!

I understand that they run the company and are the first to get the blame if the value of the company stock goes down. But do they really need to make 700 times more than the average employee at that company? To me, this is the problem of capitalism. These aholes not only make a ton of money on salaries but also get nice incentives and stock options. When the average employee at any company under-performs, they are normally fired. When a CEO under-performs, they get millions in bonuses or severance packages. How is that good business sense?

Someone from Bank of America from Card Services called and reminded me that I am delinquent. I was expecting that at some point:) He knew the exact amount I owed and I told him I'd pay next week online.      Here is the strange thing: He then asked me for a routing number off my check. I said I didn't have any checks on me and then he asked me again to see if I had a check on me or a deposit slip, so he can get the info in case I guess I didn't pay.      Do banks do this? And since he supposedly can bring up my bank info and know my balance due, couldn't he just simply get my routing number and other info if he really worked there? I lied to him and said I didn't have it because it sounded suspicious.      Was this a phishing scam?  I probably sound paranoid but you never know.

I was told by Merrill Lynch at the point it defaulted last October that they would automatically take 20% of the loan balance out of my 401K account and send it to the IRS for taxes. I started getting all my documents together, 1099, W2s, etc. to do my taxes and I'm trying to figure out where it show that the 20% was paid. I called Merrill Lynch and asked where it shows the 20% and I was informed that the 20% was never paid to the IRS. I was so mad! They just kept apologizing that I was misinformed. This is a big thing to be misinformed about, I was told more than once when I called that the 20% would be paid and the reps. explained that I would be responsible for any taxes over the 20% if I fall into a higher taxes bracket. What can I do? My loan balance was for 30K, I was worried about paying the taxes over the 20% now I have to come up with all the taxes. What's the smartest way to pay the taxes come April? The only means I have is maybe a credit card but is that best thing to do?

20090205111131AAs2ncN	Business & Finance;Small Business	Should i start my business from home or from an office?	A friend and I are starting a business where we resell 100% soy candles by private labeling. We originally thought about working on the business from home but i heard that it may be more beneficial to work the business from some type of office for tax purposes.       I heard it was easier to claim deductions since there are some zoning restrictions for claiming a work at home business.      Our plan is to eventually expand our business (once revenue starts kicking) to a party favor, event planning type of business where our soy candles can be bought for such purposes.       I was told since my long term goal is to have a business in an office i should start off that way even if i plan to move the business to a different location once things pick up.       Can anyone shed some light on what i should do? Thanks in advance!

20090205111948AAbLwd5	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	2008 Federal Tax - Are we eligible for the rebate recovery credit?	I could not find the answer to our specific situation on IRS website, and their phone help is too busy to answer.  We filed married/joint return in 2007, with 2 children (dependents.)  The total stimulus we could have received was $1800, but we only received $1200.  I am not totally clear on the reason for this, except that it had something to do with the amount of other credits we claimed and our total (low) tax liability for 2007 (the reduction was NOT due to owing back taxes.)  Our filing status and situation for 2008 has not changed dramatically (no new dependents, etc.) and again, our total tax liability is low due to itemized deductions, child credits, etc.  Can we claim the rebate recovery, which I believe would be $600?  I realize we could have the IRS figure it, but I have heard that our refund would be delayed by a week or two and we would prefer not to wait, if possible.

20090205114523AAHVAPk	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	California is stealing my money this year, will you join me?	Hey everyone, so the state this year is issuing IOU's for your state return.  Apparently these IOUs are going to be "as good as cash", but I doubt I'll be able to use my IOU to pay for my DMV fees, etc.  There is no doubt this state is in crisis, but the facts remain that California is THE highest taxed state in the Union, nine states don't even have an income tax.  Is it no wonder businesses leave this state?       The official statement from the franchise tax board is that refund checks will be delayed for one month, however payment is ultimately dependent on the budget...  Sounds like wiggle room to me.  You and I have given this state our money, the problem is spending on their level, not our level.  If you and I were to spend money without budgeting our personal accounts, we would be in a lot of trouble.  We would most likely lose our homes, cars, and possibly jobs.  The state has our money, let the legislators figure out how to get out of this mess-it was them who got us into it.  This state needs major reform.      In doing my taxes this year, I found an option to send any refund as payment to your 2009 taxes.  In effect, you can apply your "IOU" back to the state to pay for next years taxes.  Next, I am changing my W-4 exemptions, increasing them so I get my money back on each paycheck (on the state level only).  Why would I give my money to the state, just to get an IOU again?  Fool me once...  In essence I am making a pissed off tax-payer stand.  The state likes getting your money early, and earning money on it, just to give it back to you.  You are providing the state a 0% interest loan-how nice.       Thanks for reading my rant.  Will you join me?

20090203034923AA0J4hK	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Question regarding commercial property, and lease.?	Dear Lawyers:   I have a question regarding my commercial property. I am currently renting out a commercial property, which has 2 more years left on the lease. I was approached by a business man who wanted to buy the property from the landlord, I asked the landlord if he was willing to sell the property for the business man and he said yes. Now my question is if he was to buy the premises from the landlord, what would it mean for me? (Would it mean that I would have a new landlord, would I have to be thrown out? would I get any sort of payment ? ) So please explain to me what would happen in these cases??      Thanks in advance.

20090203041606AARd5TT	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I moved into a house just over a year ago?	when i moved in as it was rented from a housing association i was entitled to a decorating grant. at the time of signing the agreement they only gave me half the vouchers saying i would receive the rest when i had used the first lot. i used the first lot but am still waiting to receive the second lot, which i have asked for on a couple of occasions. i have since gotten into rent arrears (which are getting sorted, i now pay so much on top of my weekly rent) but since getting into arrears i have been a bit embarrassed to ask my housing officer for them. should i just phone and ask for them now that everything is getting sorted?
20090203043243AAQv3zx	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	Is someone who has worked in IT a good candidate for an IT Recruiter position?	I have a degree in computer science and nearly 3 years experience working in various positions in IT.  But, I've found that I'm not interested in the work I do so I'd like to try to use my IT experience to lead me down a different path.  Would an IT Recruiter be possible?  Would I be a good candidate with only real-world IT experience and no HR or recruiting experience?  Or will companies overlook me?
