20090306161950AARvYKx	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Someone made fun of me just because of my clothes....?	Hi I'm a girl that's about 13. I'm not exactly the type that wears those clothes that the other kids wear at my school. I think they're too expensive and it's not worth buying something just cuz everyone else is. I mean really, I see jeans that are worth $80. Our family isn't exactly rich to buy those kind of things and my parents taught me to appreciate what we have. One day, when I was making a presentation in class, I heard a few kids whispering about me, and I knew that it was about my clothes. After class, they started to make fun of me and call me names like "dork" and things like that. I tried to ignore as best as I could but I was really hurt on the inside. It made me really sad. Do people actually judge others just on what they wear? Is fashion really just wearing what others are wearing? Can you explain to me about how fashion works?       Thank you for taking your time to read this.

20090306220844AA2a6mF	Beauty & Style;Hair	Are hairdressers required to sterilize their tools between clients?	I was getting my hair cut tonight and I asked the hairdresser if she was going to sterilize the scissors. she gave me a flat out "no."      she said it would rust the scissors and would only clean them on the condition that I paid for a new pair. And I said it was unsanitary and every hairdresser I've ever been to has had a jar of alcohol dyed blue to sterilize her instruments between clients, and if she didn't clean them then I was leaving.      so I walked home with wet hair.            anyway, my question is, am I out of my mind? I know it is my right to refuse if I didnt feel comfortable with the level of sanitation. But it's just that both of the hair dressers there looked at me like I had told them I was an alien, and that expecting them to clean their tools between clients was a ridiculous and unreasonable request. So I'm kind of second guessing if I was right.

Is it easy to wipe/wash off?

20090306231248AAyN2m9	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	This girl is AMAZING!!!  She is the first one to not play games with me.  How would I keep her?	I asked her to hang out Friday night. We ended up walking for 2 hours in New York City at 10pm, on random streets. The whole time we were just going back and forth with the teasing.      Anyhow, we get along amazingly well. She's a really different girl too - no game playing at all! Except for one time when she immediately introduced herself to a passing hot guy and talked to him for 10 minutes while shooting me glances (I totally understand hahaha.) But she didn't go further and while we left, she almost completely ignored him. I thought that was the coolest thing.      It was not one of those "okay, lets have a dinner and a movie" dates. We just hung out for 3-4 hours and then grabbed some food. Didn't feel like a date at all. Seriously, the way we talked, it was like we were already girlfriend/boyfriend. None of this "will you call me again?" stuff. We've only known each other for 2 weeks!      But since this isn't the normal dating pace, how should I do this? I see her in class Monday - Do I hang out with her Monday night, or wait till next weekend? She seems waaaaaaaay too into me. She doesn't seem like a game-playing girl; If I go slow, she might lose interest - if I move too fast, again she might lose interest. In my case, what should I do? Obviously I'm not going to hang out with her every day before we're even official!

20090306230200AAYiCY0	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Ladies, let's have the truth....what are your thoughts on p*nis size?	Okay, it's pretty aparent that size does, to at least some extent, matter.  Any guy who would argue obviously is either insecure about his own size or has been told by women that he was "fine" or "okay" and so he interpreted that as meaning "size doesn't matter".        So, how would you rate size on your list of "important sexual stuff"?  Is it number one, is it somewhere in the middle, is it pretty low on the list?  What?      I think alot of guys are wanting to know this and some are afraid to ask.  I say, let the truth come out!  So to speak... ;-)      What are your initial reactions to small, average, and large p*nis sizes?  Do you expect smaller men to be less good and larger men to be better?  Do you not judge at all, waiting to see how he "uses it"?  What runs through your mind when you first see a guy for the first time?      I know there are alot of quesiton marks here, but there are alot of questions I feel should be addressed.  So ladies, please state your HONEST thoughts/beliefs/opinons on p*nis size.  Also, girth seems to feel better than length, so is that more important?  Are they equally important?  Please share as much as possible.        Thank you :D

If i did get a large tattoo covering the top left half of my back, part of my shoulder, part of my chest and maybe a bit of my arm. I'm thinking of getting this ballin dragon well yea i won't go into detail about that but anyway. How will the tattoo stretch when i get taller? Also when my shoulders broden and if my arms and chest get more muscular. Is it going to stretch very badly? Should i just work out for a few months to get more muscle and then get the tattoo? It's easy for you to say be patient and wait till you are done growing but you arn't the one who wants the tattoo, i am...so yea. Anyone know about stretching?

20090307141404AAf2nEg	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	What was this stuff she used when I got a pedicure?	I've never wanted a pedicure before because I was so ashamed of one of my toes. When I was a teenager I dropped a table on it and ever since then it had a big split down the middle of the nail and was really ugly and never grew right. Whenever I wanted to wear sandals, I would go to the drugstore and get one of those fake glue on nails for it, and it would be ok for the day. Well today I got a pedicure for the first time in my life, and I was explaining my toe to the girl and she said oh we can fix that right up. She dipped a brush into this liquid, then into this powdery stuff and brushed it on. When it dried she buffed it then did it a couple more times. Now my nail looks like a normal nail! I almost cried. What was that stuff she used and can I buy it anywhere (like a beauty supply shop?) What do I ask for? Do you think my nail will be normal now or will I have to have that done every so often for it to look right?

20090307142625AA6VT6r	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	What type of Boxer-Briefs do you women like on us guys?	So.  I made a Yahoo!Answers submission a little while ago and a lot of women have expressed a preference for men wearing "Boxer-Briefs" (the combination type).  For those of you who like men in Boxer-Briefs, can you provide a link to an example of the type that you really like?  Generally you're not seeing a guys boxer-briefs unless are pants are off (unless we're lifting are arms up high and are shirt lifts up or something).  I tend to wear slightly form-fitting shirts, so when I raise my arms up high women will generally see the strap and maybe a little bit of the fabric (if I'm wearing low-fitted jeans that day).      On a previous Yahoo!Answers, one of the women posted the following link as something she likes to see on her boyfriend.    http://men.style.com/slideshows/mens/sta...    So, if you REALLY don't want to spend 1-2 minutes finding pictures, then perhaps you could provide your opinnion on this particular pair of boxer-briefs?   Thanks ahead of time ladies!  Looking foward to your responses (you serve a benefit to women everywhere when guys listen to your opinnions on this matter, ha-ha).  Take care!  :D
