hP2nzb2haa	A glow in the dark party is pretty simple. You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Call the stores first; most are out, usually available around Halloween season. (I do know Walgreen have them right now and usually always do. Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, and hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!|`|IaECLRgjaa	Ya I think 80's or 60's would be really cool!

Israelis are worse than terrorists they are cold blooded murderers. I would not take Israeli citizenship if you paid me 5 million dollars a year. I'd have mass murderers for neighbors and I am picky about where I live. I won't even live as close as South Florida.

En ese articulo el periodico informa que un ni?o palestino de 14 a?os llego a un puesto de control cargado de explosivos. Como la inteligencia israeli ya estaba alertada, en el lugar lo esperaba toda la prensa internacional. El ni?o tenia como motivo volar el lugar donde, segun el periodico, habia algunos israelies y unos 300 palestinos. Cuando el ni?o se acerco y vio el gentio, comenzo a correr para cumplir su mision. Si se lo hubiera hecho volar hubiera habido alli una masacre de civiles palestinos. Afortunadamente, con altoparlantes se lo convencio de deternerse y con un robot especial se consiguio desmontarle los explosivos.

zknlQCJGaa	Ayers was in the Weathermen group that opposed the Vietnam War.  Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, imperialism and colonialism and, for those involved with the New Left, capitalism itself, such as the Catholic Worker Movement. <br>  High-profile opposition to the Vietnam war turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion against the war. The protests gained momentum from the Civil Rights Movement that had organized to oppose segregation laws, which had laid a foundation of theory and infrastructure on which the anti-war movement grew. Protests were fueled by a growing network of independently published newspapers  and the timely advent of large venue rock'n'roll festivals such as Woodstock and Grateful Dead shows, attracting younger people in search of generational togetherness.<br>  The fatal shooting of four anti-war protesters at Kent State University cemented the resolve of many protesters. The Kent State killings saw campuses erupt all across the country; in May 1970 most universities were strike-bound, for example at Wayne State University. The late 1960s in the U.S. became a time of youth rebellion, mass gatherings and riots, many of which began in response to the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., but which ignited in an atmosphere of open opposition to a wartime government.<br>  Provocative actions by police and by protesters turned anti-war demonstrations in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic National Convention into a riot. Explosive news reports of American military abuses, such as the 1968 My Lai Massacre, brought new attention and support to the anti-war movement.<br>  Veterans of the Vietnam War returned home to join the movement, including John Kerry, who spearheaded Vietnam Veterans Against the War and testified before Congress in televised hearings. Other U.S. veterans returned from the war saying that nobody wants to be in a war where people are suffering and dying, but that they found peace in their own minds by knowing they served their country. <br>  <br>  The excerpts above show that anti-war protests (Vietnam War) had taken on a very broad and popular front, especially by the young Americans.  Ayers was of no exception.  Yes, he was more militant in his approach and he wanted to make his point heard and noticed.  He was against acts of "violence and terrorism" used by the USA soldiers in Vietnam.<br>  Bill Ayers: "You could not be a moral person with the means to act, and stand still.  To stand still was to choose indifference. Indifference was the opposite of moral"|`|zHQVlXd5aa	The problem is Obama's relationship with several very anti-American people.  <br>  <br>  They did kill a San Francisco police officer.  |`|f505ec555406ee10006768ec6cfc1aeaaa	You should thank the soldiers (present and past), for they are the very reason you have the freedoms you were born with. Those freedoms are protected tomorrow and for every day to come because of soldiers like me. You whiny libs will cry about violence and oppression, and then condone terrorist activities by one of your own when it suits your argument. Ayers had no passion. He preached socialism/communism, and now his hypocritical *** is living rather well in a "well-to-do" burb near Chicago. So much for a cause. Enjoy your freedom to spout shyte you ball-less, whining fukstyk!<br>  The US has been threatened many times throughout history. Check out this thing called HISTORY: Pearl Harbor, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the heightened alert we lived under with the cold war with the USSR. <br>  Sorry that simplicity doesn't work, but we don't live in the idealistic world that liberals are always trying to create. There is the way it should be, and then there is just  the way it is. Military forces exist to invade and defend. Are corporate/political interests involved in our military actions? Of course they are. These interests are not the sole reason for the existence of our military. <br>  I just wish you pinko-commies could look at the world as it really is rather than what you wish it could be. Utopia will never exist. It has been attempted over and over, and guess what?, it doesn't work. It isn't in our nature to exist among fields of roses holding hands with our neighbors. What kind of boring world would that be?|`|yBTiUPREaa	Wow.  You are so ungrateful and disrespectful to all veterans.  This worm tried to make a bomb to set off at a dance for US Soldiers and their wives at Ft. Dix, he was a domestic terrorist.  He did not stop the Vietnam war.  These idiots back then didn't realize that protesting the soldiers and treating them like crap wasn't going to stop the war, it made their morale go down and they ended up being thousands of miles away from home fighting for dumba**es who hated them.  It's idiotic to think that everyone is bringing peace to the table.  There is always going to be tension with or without armies as you say in your "point".  That's human nature.  You should just be glad that these brave soldiers were willing to go fight for maybe not necessarily a war they believed in, but did their duty to their country and fought for your right to open your piehole.  Are you sure you're an American citizen?  You're a disgrace and I can't believe that there were others just like you when those poor soldiers came back home.  They deserved so much better and they still do.  SHAME ON YOU.|`|72e6eb5b57ed9d0fb87b09c2df0e05c5aa	Someone could have been killed in those federal buildings. My taxes and every American who pays taxes paid for those federal buildings, and who was he to destroy them! If something is a "political" or any other kind of statement, shouldn't he have used his mouth for a statement, not bombs! It was not a massacre- so if he killed thousands of people then it would be okay to see him as a terrorist but since no-one was hurt then it is okay! He did blow up a judges house where his 8 year old son was sleeping, and the family did narrowly escape being burned to death, but I guess since they ran fast enough then it is fine. I guess instead of the thousands of Americans who fought in the Viet Nam war, many who died and many who came home we should not thank them for our freedom we should instead thank this  home town bomber, did he save any American lives with his bombs. Who is jealous of him, far from it I pity a man who must bomb the country who gave him this freedom to speak against his own government. Why doesn't he go to a foreign country and try bombing there and see where he winds up!

Even under controlled circumstances, property damage is still a crime. Imagine how fast society would break down if anyone could hurt or destroy anyone or anything because they believe it's the "right thing" to do.

c47cb47737f8bdf3da5aee61fff99327aa	El desgraciado mas nerd del mundo.<br>  <br>  William Henry Gates III (Seattle, Washington, Estados Unidos, 28 de octubre de 1955)[1] más conocido como Bill Gates, es un empresario estadounidense, cofundador de la empresa de software Microsoft, productora del sistema operativo para computadoras personales más utilizado en el mundo (según algunas estimaciones nueve ordenadores de cada diez utilizan algún sistema Windows[2]).<br>  <br>  Está casado con Melinda French[1], y ambos ostentan el liderazgo de la Fundación Bill y Melinda Gates, dedicada a reequilibrar oportunidades en salud y educación a nivel global, especialmente en las regiones menos favorecidas[3], razón por la cual han sido recientemente galardonados con el Premio Príncipe de Asturias de Cooperación Internacional 2006.<br>  <br>  Cursó estudios en la escuela privada de élite de Lakeside, en Seattle. Esta escuela tenía ya una computadora en el a?o 1968, así Gates tuvo la posibilidad de contactar pronto con la máquina y tomarle el gusto a la informática. No tardó mucho en aprender y sólo necesitó una semana para superar a su profesor[cita requerida]. También en Lakeside, Gates conoció a Paul Allen, con quien más tarde fundaría Microsoft.<br>  <br>  Creó la empresa de software Microsoft el 4 de abril de 1975, siendo aún alumno en la Universidad de Harvard. En 1976, abandonó la universidad y se trasladó a Albuquerque, sede de Altair, para pactar con esa empresa la cesión de un lenguaje para computadoras, el Basic, al 50% de las ventas. Al a?o siguiente, se enteró del éxito de la empresa Apple y de que necesitan un intérprete de Basic.<br>  <br>  En 1980, se reunió con representantes de IBM en Seattle. Consiguió venderles el sistema operativo DOS, aunque él aún no lo tenía y luego lo compró a muy bajo precio a un joven programador. IBM necesitaba ese sistema operativo para competir con Apple, razón por la cual la negociación era flexible. Microsoft quiso los derechos de licencia, mantenimiento, e incluso la facultad de vender el DOS a otras compa?ías. IBM aceptó, considerando que lo que produciría dividendos sería el hardware y no el software. Unos días después, Microsoft compró los derechos de autor del QDOS a Tim Paterson que trabajaba para la Seattle Computer Products, por 50.000 dólares, que vendió a IBM como MS-DOS (Microsoft DOS). Lo que llama poderosamente la atención fue que IBM no comprara el MS-DOS sino que decidiera pagar a Microsoft un canon por cada copia que se vendiera junto con un IBM-PC. Lo que pocas veces se ha dicho es que por esos tiempos la madre de Gates, Mary Maxwell, era directiva de la empresa United Way conjuntamente con el CEO de IBM, John Opel. [cita requerida]<br>  <br>  Consciente de la importancia del entorno gráfico que había mostrado Apple (originalmente la interfaz gráfica y el "ratón" fueron desarrollados por Xerox PARC) en su ordenador Lisa, se propuso conseguir también el entorno gráfico y el "ratón" para operarlo. Mientras, Steve Jobs, fundador de Apple, inició el desarrollo del Macintosh, Bill Gates visitó Apple. Ofrecía mejorar sus hojas de cálculo y otros programas. Amenazaba con vender su material informático a IBM, con lo que obtuvo una alianza Apple-Microsoft. Microsoft obtuvo legalmente la tecnología de entorno gráfico y con el ratón, y sacó al mercado Microsoft Windows, como directo competidor de Macintosh.<br>  <br>  Al finalizar el segundo milenio, el sistema operativo Microsoft Windows (en todas sus versiones), se utilizaba en la mayor parte de ordenadores personales del planeta.[2]<br>  <br>  Bill Gates encabeza la lista anual de las mayores fortunas personales realizada por la revista Forbes, con bienes calculados alrededor de los 56.000 millones de dólares estadounidenses (2007)[7]. En 1994, adquirió un manuscrito de Leonardo da Vinci por 25 millones de dólares.<br>  <br>   <br>  Bill Gates con el presidente brasile?o LulaLa empresa se ha visto envuelta en diversos procesos judiciales acusada de prácticas monopolísticas, llegándose a especular incluso con la posibilidad de que los tribunales estadounidenses exigieran dividir la empresa, como ya sucediera con otras empresas estadounidenses en el pasado. Las acusaciones se relacionan con la vinculación de diversos programas a su sistema operativo, el más extendido, lo que es considerado por sus competidores un abuso de posición dominante para diversificar sus productos, como es el caso del navegador Internet Explorer, el reproductor de archivos multimedia, Windows Media Player, o el sistema de mensajería instantánea Windows Messenger incluido en el sistema operativo Windows, del que se han obtenido Windows 1.0, 2.0, /286, /386, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11, varias versiones de NT, 95, versiones de 98, 2000, Me, CE 1.0, CE 2.0, varias versiones de XP, Server 2003 y recientemente salido a la venta, Windows Vista, en varias versiones. Para el 2007 se espera la liberación del Windows Server 2007.<br>  <br>  El 16 de junio de 2006 hace pública su intención de abandonar sus labores diarias al frente de Microsoft hacia 2008 para dedicarse por entero a la fundación[8][9]. La transición de responsabilidades será progresiva para evitar afecciones negativas en el desarrollo diario de la empresa, continuando como Presidente de Honor de la misma.|`|501d0d6291626b830eb3405fc0633793aa	Los jeques Arabes son mas ricos que todos lo que ha nombrado juntos.|`|7c5cb0b8186a32e587bf0633f5f12246aa	hay q preguntas estupidas q hacen a veces!! jajajaja, eso no se sabe, tndrias q hacer un porcentaje preguntandole a todas las personas del mundo a ver quien tiene mas o quien gana mas<br>  <br>  suerte|`|Ee7muctuaa	El mexicano due?o de la tefonia celular movil Carlos slim|`|ZmjAOJDFaa	creo que los inventores de Google, sin lugar a dudas|`|Zpam4s36aa	El presidente de Microsoft, Bill Gates, sigue siendo el hombre más rico del mundo, aunque este a?o podría ser el último ante la pujante fortuna del magnate financiero Warren Buffett.

They are also the lands that the Palestinians have been asking for to establish their state on (according to UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338) in a 2-state solution.  <br>  <br>  Historic Palestine (until 1948) included the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Israel.|`|Klp0Mv6kaa	There is not such a thing as the "palestinian land",as there is not such a thing as "the palestinian people".<br>  By the resolutioo of the UN number 181,there had to be created two states in Palestine:one Jewish-and another-ARAB.Not "a palestinian ",but ARAB<br>  Jews agreed wth the resolution,and arabs decided to try to get ALL hte Palestine.In 1948 they started the war againt israel-and lost.<br>  In 1967,they tried again-and Israel again beat them up.<br>  In 1973 they tried the third time-with the same result.<br>  After that the arab states decided to go on trying to destroy Israel-but via proxy.And they,together with the Soviet KGB,since 1967 launched the global propagandistic campaign under the name "palestinian people".<br>  If you don′t believe this-just try to find anything about the "palestinian people" PRIOR to 1967.You will find NOTHING.<br>  So,such a thing as "the palestinian land" does not exist.But Israel is ready to give to arabs Gaza and major part of the West Bank-in exchange for  peace.Arabs refuse-and demand "all the territory of Palestine",as if it were their land.But the land of arabs is Arabia,not Palestine.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	>>>In fact Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people.  <br>  <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  >>>To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  <br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.(Map below)<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1-Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2-Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3-Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4-Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5-Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6-The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7-Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1-International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2-Free all prisoners.<br>  3-Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4- Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5-Remove all the settlements. <br>  6-Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7-Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace will be so far.|`|VfowGdWLaa	According to some Arabs, yes it is.

It was cold, wet, and disease was spreading in the trenches, such as trench mouth and trench foot.<br>  <br>  Basically, the problem from a Canadian standpoint was that the British generals sent the canadians to do the work that no one else wanted to do, (dangerous missions), meaning that many of the men died. You should mention something about the canadians complaining because they were not allowed to command their own troops and such<br>  <br>  P was not only a military failure, but a geographical blemish for the allies. It was muddy, and people had to use construct duck-boards to get around<br>  <br>  P is considered by many historians a waste of life and effort in such terrible conditions, because although the allies eventually won the battle of P, the Germans quickly recaptured it a few months later.

jwT20biwaa	Yes it is possible. I have attached a link to an article that discusses this subject. Hope it helps.|`|6Lcn1aLsaa	It is possible to take in too much of anything but your body will get rid of excess.|`|AS4pWko5aa	its highly unlikely <br>  <br>  ring the nhs helpline if your unsure|`|NNiN0tK0aa	It is possible to overdose on omega 3 because it causes a lot of oxidative stress in your body - creates lots of free radicals which cause a lot of harm.  Antioxidants in food mop up the free radicals.  They're found in all fruit and veg but especially blueberries, other berries, black beans, tomato-products, orange fruit/veg (carrots, squash, papaya) and dark green veg (spinach, kale) and algae and wheatgrass.  The more free radicals in your body the more antioxidants in your body.  <br>  So the more omega 3 or other polyunsatured fats - sunflower/vegetable oil, nuts, seeds, margerine - you consume, the more antioxidants you need to take in.  If you make sure you increase your antioxidant-intake then there's nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  The omega 3 in capsules usually comes in extremely low dosages, so not something to worry about anyway.  You would get much more omega 3 from oily fish.  For some diseases - psoriasis, heart disease - the recommended dose would mean taking at least 6 capsules per day but sometimes upto 16 or more.  Thats why many people buy bottles of oil instead...its cheaper, and easier than counting out so many capsules.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	Actually the death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and this is well documented.  The high costs are for the legal process and the upfront costs (pre trial and trial level) are the largest part.  Here is part of a report that spells some of this out- it is from the Kansas Dept of Corrections:<br>  <br>  “The study counted death penalty case costs through to execution and found that the median death penalty case costs $1.26 million. Non-death penalty cases were counted through to the end of incarceration and were found to have a median cost of $740,000. For death penalty cases, the pre-trial and trial level expenses were the most expensive part, 49% of the total cost. The investigation costs for death-sentence cases were about 3 times greater than for non-death cases.  The trial costs for death cases were about 16 times greater than for non-death cases ($508,000 for death case; $32,000 for non-death case).”  (Performance Audit Report: Costs Incurred for Death Penalty Cases: A K-GOAL Audit of the Department of Corrections)<br>  <br>  Other states report the same thing.  (Links below)<br>  It is hard to understand why the legal costs are so great.  Here are a few of the contributing factors:<br>  ? more pre-trial time will be needed to prepare: cases typically take a year to come to trial<br>  ? more pre-trial motions will be filed and answered<br>  ? more experts will be hired <br>  ? twice as many attorneys will be appointed for the defense, and a comparable team for the prosecution<br>  ? jurors will have to be individually quizzed on their views about the death penalty, and they are more likely to be sequestered<br>  ? two trials instead of one will be conducted: one for guilt and one for punishment<br>  ? the trial will be longer: a cost study at Duke University estimated that death penalty trials take 3 to 5 times longer than typical murder trials<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Final Report of the Death Penalty Subcommittee of the Committee on Public Defense, Washington State Bar Association, December 2006, <a href="http://www.wsba.org/lawyers/groups/committeeonpublicdefense.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsba.org/lawyers/groups/commi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/northcarolina.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/northcar...</a> links to "The Costs of Processing Murder Cases in North Carolina" Duke University, May 1993<br>  <br>  The Tennessee Comptroller of the Treasury Office of Research's Report, "Tennessee's Death Penalty: Costs and Consequences."  <a href="http://www.comptroller.state.tn.us/orea/reports/deathpenalty.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.comptroller.state.tn.us/orea/...</a><br>  <br>  and, from California, the most recent report at<br>  <a href="http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/reports/dp/official/FINAL%20REPORT%20DEATH%20PENALTY.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccfaj.org/documents/reports/d...</a>|`|nhfaPN0Iaa	no lengthy costs involved.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	There are None. Of ALL the Legal "Options", the Death Penalty is the MOST expensive...  :(|`|73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	That is a common misconception.  The truth is, the death penalty costs MUCH more than life imprisonment.<br>  <br>  The reason for this is that the government wants to be as sure as possible of guilt before handing down the harshest possible (and most irreversible) sentence.<br>  <br>  Toward that end, much more is spent on pre-trial preparation (most capital cases take a year or more to come to trial), more lawyers on both sides, expert witnesses on both sides, longer trials, jury sequestration, added courtroom security, and often an additional sentencing trial, to name just a few of the additional costs.<br>  <br>  Many believe the financial burden of death penalty cases is a big reason why you see HIGHER violent crime rates in death penalty jurisdictions - money spent (wasted) on capital cases is money that could have gone to police departments, education, drug treatment programs, and other government services that help prevent crime.<br>  <br>  See the website below for some individual state statistics.|`|X6rFPI2laa	The only way it saves money is if you include only the costs of food, shelter, heat, medical care, etc.  If you include the cost of the legal appeals (some of which are required and not discretionary in death penalty cases in almost all jurisdictions), you will certainly see that those costs will exceed any savings from food, etc. savings.  The government pays judges' salaries and benefits, pays for court transcripts, pays the appellate attorneys who represent the goverment, and in many cases also has to pay the costs of the attorneys for the defendant (in the mandatory appeal).  I think the Department of Justice web site will have all the data you may need, but don't have that web site handy -- but "Department of Justice" should get you there, or "Bureau of Prisons".|`|d12a585a9f486535d07b0683ef24b00eaa	Actually The death Penalty  DOESN'T save money...  with the endless appeals that they are entitled to, shyster lawyers drain the taxpayers needlessly .. Personally, the way they execute today.. I say keep em locked up 24/7 in a cell with a 20 watt bulb, And gruel for meals. You and I should Die so easily.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Because taxpayers don't have to pay for the food, electricity etc of prisoners.|`|WN3QVWEdaa	It saves money in that the system then doesn't have to pay for the housing, food, security etc. of the prisoners.<br>  <br>    HOWEVER it costs more than a normal life sentence in that many death row prisoners are placed in top-security jails which cost more to run and police, and also that they may still mount legal proceedings against their sentence anyway, which costs time and money.|`|AA10153636	It costs about 36,000 dollars a year to house each prisoner<br>  Plus they get free medical and dental.

9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact peace is so far; Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace will be so far.|`|lPFUfbAyaa	The Arabs and the Jews have been fighting for several thousand years with no end in sight.

Build up the Palestinian economy and make sure they are electing well politicians and not terrorist monkeys. Build up the humanitarian aid in both Israel and Palestine. Elect officials in the two countries that will get along and corporate. Have the IDF remove the West Bank settlements. Protect both Jews and Arabs from terrorists.|`|pEC5uLlRaa	re-locate Israel to North Africa|`|fxNOVa9faa	leaving them alone..let them settle their differences,stop other countries butting in,they are just making it worst.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	For Israel to retreat to their 1947 borders, which they should never have moved beyond, and had no right at all to do.

You only have to look around you with open eyes for the answers. Our world today is too much influenced by materialism. People are excessively hooked up on material things that would influence their sense of morality. The result is that there is overwhelming moral decadence in society. Ironically, not much value is being given on what is good and what is bad. Everything goes. Churches are half empty in most of the western countries no matter what religion you belong. There is blatant disregard on what we can learn from our faith. There is blatant disregard on things spiritual. People do not, to say the least, connect and communicate with God. Worse, most people influenced by materialism and greed would like to think that they alone are knowledgeable on what is good and bad for their life. People do not turn humbly and have recourse on things spiritual.. When we lose our sense of morality much worse and graver things will happen to people than what happened to the 13 year old boy. What happened to the boy is, of course, an outraged because the incident would simply show to us the extent of moral decadence in today's society..

I didnt have kids to young, but i have been divorced and forced to raise two little ones on my own and that was a struggle. I want my kids to have better than what i had. A 13 year old and 15 year old is way to young to have kids. They will learn soon enough to how much of a responsibility that is. But i think the biggest kicker will be when they see their friends going to college and making something of themselves and the 13 and 15 year get left behind.|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i haven't heard this story<br>  it's a sad thing, as you are already aware these are KIDS we are talking about<br>  it's shocking to me that the parents (according to your blurb here) are not concerned<br>  but who knows what goes on behind closed doors, perhaps they are very concerned....let's hope so!|`|W4Dek41Jaa	O_O that's because everything in the world revolves around sex.

And yes, the CIA started the mistake and the UK is a puppet state almost of the US and therefore they sided with them. <br>  Also, after 9/11 the world didn't want terrorism so they didn't want to take chances.  <br>  Again, the US THOUGHT they saw weapons through a satellite, but it was merely a mistake.

Size zero for people is bad enough - but at least it's a person's own choice. These poor dogs have no voice and are being forced to go without food for the most shallow of reasons.  This is nothing short of animal cruelty and the owners should be prosecuted and banned from owning any pets.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	This just takes the biscuit.  This is animal cruelty, no doubt about it.  However,these dogs should be refused entry to the competitions full stop.

That is animal cruelty and the owners should be charged with cruelty just like anybody else who mistreats their pets . I don't care if people want to be anorexic , but denying a dog food and water for the sake of their appearance is none other than sickening . Some people should not be allowed to have animals , and they are a perfect example right there .|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Well it's kind of the judges responsibility to make sure this stops happening. If a dog is undernourished, it should be disqualified, and banned from showing for a year.<br>  <br>  I don't know about the mentality "size 0" encourages, but it certainly doesn't make any literal sense. Seems sort of like saying someone doesn't exist.|`|XvjfvGohaa	I understand what you're saying about the influence of the media, but some people just can't help being skinny.  Some people try and try to gain weight and just can't.  I don't think size zero is wrong, nor do I think size ten is wrong.  All that matters is that the person is healthy.  I don't think most people can help what size pants they wear.|`|fKH7fVHPaa	what?! thats realy strange this world revolves around diet and size zero etc, i say we should just get on with our lives and and talk about the things that really matter like fashion or just interesting things,it's been going on too long in my opinion its ridiculous that its now spreading to dogs! its not they have a choice if they want to be either! poor things this should be classed as animal cruelty! as does over feeding your pet is!|`|h59cFPS9aa	Size zero for dogs - now that's just ridiculous and cruel. Humans have the choice if they want to be size zero or not its their preference but the poor dogs have no choice surely its got to be classed as animal cruelty to malnourish them?|`|pPr4gWXyaa	the size zero rule is like a fetish, it has become way too much of an obsessive thing. How sad.
VOFB1dCRaa	We live in world where people are far to sensitive.  There was an episode of Boston Legal, where a little black girl wanted to play Annie, and when she didn't get the part, her mother sued over racism.<br>  <br>  What about maintaining the integrity of the artist who wrote the original story.  Does it matter that the character was white?  No, of course, the author must have been racist to write a story with a white character and people who wouldn't cast a black girl in the role of a white character, so they must be racist.   If a little black girl can play Annie, then a white man should be able to play Malcom X.  Right?  You can't have it both ways.  What about Melvin Peebles casting a black man to play the white part (although short) in the movie Watermelon man?  What about that, come on get over it all ready.  Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy cast a black actor in a part that Douglas Adams wrote as a white character but thats ok, right.  You can't have it both ways. Equal is equal, equal does not mean superiority.  I have nothing against the actor who played Ford Prefect, he was great and funny but none the less, the role was originally a white character.  He was only in the movie to meet affirmative action quotas. How very sad.<br>  <br>  It is insane and people should just get over it.  The media propagates racism, which by the way is a societal construct.  There is only one race, the human race.  GET OVER IT PEOPLE.<br>  <br>  This is absolutely insane.  I am so glad I have all Fawlty Towers on tape.  So I can watch it whenever I want.  All the PCers, can go F*** themselves.|`|DR91BwGraa	Well they won`t show `It Aint Half Hot Mum` either will they. Just because an actor blacked up his face to play the Indian manservant. For heavens sake, it was a different time. :(<br>  <br>  Funny how it`s ok for David Walliams to black himself up to play the character `Desiree` in `Little Britain`.<br>  <br>  Talk about double standards.|`|rIzx4OEWaa	There are way to many things on which this government should sort out an old BBc shows should not even be on it. <br>  To ignore our history is to deny who we are which is something that is going on today. The people of the country many years ago died fighting for the freedom of democracy an the individual did they all die in vain.<br>  I am not a racist nor do I condone an form of racist slurring in front of me. I am white an English an proud to say so. While it is true many other countries fought in the two last world wars some did so in order to obtain there own freedom for self leadership an determination, what I cannot condone is when these people come to this country to live an then complain about our way of life? we are not now allowed to have freedom of Speech in case it upsets them as a different race of people?<br>  I am astounded by these views because they have earned the right to live an say what the want back home in there own country so why do we not have the same right. If someone called me something that I thought particularly in bad taste I would let them know an expect an apology for it. What more can be said. As for raceual insults it is bang out of order for anyone to provoke another simply because of the colour of anothers skin an those who do deserve what they get. But history is history pretending that it did mnot happen won't make it go away so let's face up to it. I have seen many shows around the world where they take the mick out of the English an yet we have no choice but to accept it because the governments abroad will do nothing to change peoples attitudes unlike this country. This is a world issue an needs to be treated as such. At the moment it is Unfair to the free thinking individual in this country be they Black, White, Or in technicolour. An this government should treat us all the same across the board. As for the BBC it is a step to far.|`|Pe3e7wwYaa	This is absolutely crazy.

There are lots of things that used to be deemed as racist and sexist but it was filmed years ago.  If we don't show them anymore then it's just like hiding a piece of history.  There were aslsorts of programmes around then that were fine in it's time but frowned upon now:  <br>  <br>  Love thy neighbour, carry on movies, please sir, till death us do part, man about the house, on the buses etc etc it was harmless comedy.  <br>  Standards were different in those days and people now are just ready to critisise for the hell of it.

Possibly so many different kind of ppl & their different interests are hindering us from being a 'true nation'.<br>  <br>  And when it comes to Indian movies, I think India is much possessed with Bollywood, & Bollywood is much possessed with regional, short-term goals. For a long time they've separated themselves from 'world cinema'. Now the things are changing, but it'll take many years to reach to their position.<br>  <br>  Some ppl say westerners doesn't 've proper idea about Indian films. I'll say we ourselves are responsible for this.<br>  <br>   And 'Slumdog.....' has really done something 'impossible' - it has earned three Oscars to three Indians. I didn't like AR's work in this film, but I think it has given him the respect which he should have got much earlier - for Lagaan or RDB.|`|1tLmTjBxaa	yes a movie is succeful in terms of the collection it makes and profits,awards like oscars are for movies with values,and only liked by some people ..,Western recognition bcoz India already thinks USA is heaven and its obvious|`|ie5M9JOMaa	We have always allowed others to dictate the terms for us!

xZwwb3kVaa	If you believe all the stupid stories about Global Warming, you then would believe that the Moon is made of green cheese. This is all a scam and if you read anything, then read what most of the Scientists say.This is a cycle that happens perhaps every hundreds of years, and also  will not happen again for hundreds more again. This is another scare tactic that these people like to conjure up when they have nothing else better to do.They love to put us all in a state of terror, like they do on more occasions, because it stirs the people up, and that to them is  a few more Dollars or Pounds into the pot.These people love to stir the pot as that way it keeps them in the way that they are used to. Big ideas, Big money, and Big houses.They all jump on the band wagon, praying we will be listening.|`|B5YsTF4iaa	Global warming is MOSTLY a hoax. It being portrayed as this natural disaster that is immenint is wrong. However, the global temperature is rising due to increased green house gasses. This is normal though.It has been going up for centuries. It has increased abnormally by an extremely small amount. Obama is attempting to turn America green, which will do more than protect the environment. It will protect our health, decrease cancer rates etc. Do you have any idea how many small particles are in the air we breathe? You dont want to know, trust me. It's really bad. Jogging next to a busy street is equivilant to smoking a cigarette, lets put it that way. That is only approximate though. One thing to remember and this is for everyone, the earth, and everything, is cyclical. If you don't know what that means you should. thousands of years from now, we will go through a period of cooling. It just happens this way. We might even experience a polar shift, which would be really weird. Don't fret. Live|`|9ZkzBAQCaa	They premise of your question is faulty.  It is not clearly a hoax at all.

And that a lot of species of animals... like penguins and polar bears are having a hard time living in their arctic/antarctic habitats? Right?  And that the Antarctic ice shelf is on the brink of collapse?  These are hard facts.  <br>  <br>  We also know that a chunk of rainforest... the second biggest contributor of oxygen to our planet (second only to green algae)... the size of Rhode Island is cut down every day. And that in addition to that,  there's millions of fossil fuels burned in cars and factories every day that put Carbon Dioxide and Monoxide into the atmosphere.  To deny that is like denying that cigarettes can cause cancer.   I live in Chicago, kid, and I've seen the lines of smog over Lake Michigan.  I've smelled the exhaust in the air.  I've washed the soot off my face when I get home from downtown.  It's real. <br>  <br>  You must also have learned in Science 101 that Carbon Dioxide helps insulate the earth by keeping the sun's energy trapped in our atmosphere.<br>  <br>  So... more carbon dioxide being produced.... less being consumed by trees... I dunno, it seems like chutes and ladders to me.<br>  <br>  Of course it's still technically a theory, and I guess there's a (tiny) possibility that this is a natural occurrence... but honestly, why would you want to assume that?<br>  <br>  I mean, scientists also made the discovery that the chemicals in cigarettes increase one's risk of assorted cancers.  Are you going to doubt them on that too?  Maybe it's a hoax, so you might as well light up.<br>  <br>  I mean, seriously.  What's your reasoning for thinking it's a hoax?  I've heard so many people utter that phrase... but I've never heard any reasons their opinion.<br>  <br>  Sound like cognitive dissonance to me.  I think that some people just aren't willing to change their lifestyle, so they try to rationalize in their heads to (subconsciously?) make themselves not feel like bad people.|`|ce150cba77d5a8e4bc72290ebf1eb4f6aa	I didnt read the whole question...

9BeUbORtaa	No. It has very little to do with religion. It is about colonialism, displacement, and what used to be called "the Great Game" of empire. That said, it is very much in the interests of the Israeli government to depict the conflict as part of the 'global war on terror' or the conflict between Judeo-Christian West and Muslim East. But this is not true. Many Israelis are secular (and Israel was established by secular Jews as a secular state), and many Palestinians are Christian. What is true, however, is that the ongoing conflict incites sectarian hatred on both sides, and fuels religious hatred in the entire region.<br>  <br>  Also, as you see here, evangelical Christians who are convinced that Biblical prophecy is being played out before their very eyes (much more than most Jews do) fan the flames. They certainly have a lot of influence from the American perspective.|`|FP49kXBsaa	only if religion can be put down to greed|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Most Jews in Israel are not religous, many are atheists.......so I don't believe it's religion-based.

vhlORK4Waa	Jihad, an Islamic term, is a religious duty of Muslims. In Arabic, the word jihād is a noun meaning "struggle." Jihad appears frequently in the Qur'an and common usage as the idiomatic expression "striving in the way of Allah (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)". A person engaged in jihad is called a mujahid, the plural is mujahideen.<br>  <br>  A minority among the Sunni scholars sometimes refer to this duty as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it occupies no such official status.In Twelver Shi'a Islam, however, Jihad is one of the 11 Practices of the Religion.<br>  <br>  According to scholar John Esposito, Jihad requires Muslims to "struggle in the way of God" or "to struggle to improve one's self and/or society."<br>  <br>   Jihad is directed against Satan's inducements, aspects of one's own self, or against a visible enemy.<br>  <br>   The four major categories of jihad that are recognized are Jihad against one's self (Jihad al-Nafs), Jihad of the tongue (Jihad al-lisan), Jihad of the hand (Jihad al-yad), and Jihad of the sword (which can involve combat against non-Muslims)(Jihad as-sayf).<br>  <br>  Islamic military jurisprudence focuses on regulating the conditions and practice of Jihad as-sayf, the only form of warfare permissible under Islamic law, and thus the term Jihad is usually used in fiqh manuals in reference to military combat.<br>  <br>  The term "Jihad" used without any qualifiers is generally understood in the West to be referring to holy war on behalf of Islam.In broader usage and interpretation, the term has accrued both violent and non-violent meanings. It can simply mean striving to live a moral and virtuous life, spreading and defending Islam as well as fighting injustice and oppression, among other things.[The relative importance of these two forms of jihad is a matter of controversy.<br>  <br>  does this help?<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Yes, "jihad" just means struggle, and it's just to do with the stresses and strains of daily life, like struggling to study for your exams or struggling to get the washing done for example.<br>  <br>  A similar example is Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf" (My Struggle), which is about the trails and tribulations of a struggling early 20th century Austrian painter.|`|d7f2c01962fe4f1fd4ed854d458d9f91aa	The literal translation of Jihad, which is derived from the Arabic root meaning, is "to strive" or "to make an effort,"  Down the centuries and to this day, however, men are still putting forward their own interpretations and ideas of exactly how the Qu'ran means us to "strive" or "make an effort"!|`|hJaiyf2haa	It is pretty much translated as crusade - which is a word that "W" got into a lot of trouble for using after 9/11. So it can mean anything from struggle to holy war depending on what context it is being used.|`|s8nPN7pVaa	The literal meaning of Jihad is struggle or effort, and it means much more than holy war.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/jihad_1.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/...</a>|`|crZg76Hpaa	It means struggle. It means the struggle to be like a good muslim throughout a muslim's life.|`|n9PUzlhzaa	Jihad mean struggle.|`|D7JZPxDzaa	lol no it means holy war<br>  <br>  putting a jihad on someone means you are going to kill them over religion|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	Definition: Jihad is the Arabic for what can be variously translated as "struggle" or "effort," or "to strive," "to exert," "to fight," depending on the context. In the West, the word is generally understood to mean "holy war," and the terms are given, inaccurately, exclusively military connotations.<br>  The Quran does call for "jihad" as a military struggle on behalf of Islam. But the Quran also refers to jihad as an internal, individual, spiritual struggle toward self-improvement, moral cleansing and intellectual effort. It is said that Prophet Muhammad considered the armed-struggle version of holy war "the little jihad," but considered the spiritual, individual version of holy war--the war within oneself--as "the great jihad."<br>  <br>  Including the "jihad" as one of the five pillars of Islam is another common Western misunderstanding. Jihad is not among the five pillars of Islam (the profession of faith, prayer five times a day, fasting during Ramadan, alms for the poor and performance of the Hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, at least once in each Muslim's lifetime).<br>  <br>  Still, "jihad" is considered to be every Muslim's duty--be it the struggle to improve society, preventing the exploitation of the poor or vulnerable, or improving oneself before the Day of Judgment.<br>  <br>  Several militant or political Islamic organizations have adopted the term in their monikers. These include Egypt's Jamaat al-Jihad community, established in the late 1970s by militant Sunnis and responsible for the assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981; Islamic Jihad, an offshoot of Hezbollah in Lebanon and used since 1982 in covert military activities; and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which has conducted suicide attacks on Israeli targets. All three groups are on the U.S. State Department's list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations|`|NARiXGNDaa	it means both, but is more meaning sence its struggle, coz in a muslims life you have to struggle in this life to attain the best in the hereafter insha'Allah<br>  <br>  xx|`|6c5de9b5e373f9d742a67201820b4b46aa	i think it interprets as Brain dead.|`|pvkLm0pCaa	im pretty sure it means Holy war.|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Jhad means Holy War|`|xZwwb3kVaa	I have always said that Religion causes most wars, as they are blinded by it. If one looks back in History this has been the cause of many conflicts, and it will never alter. The Churches    overseas seem to be involved in all of these,because Religion makes them fanatics, and blinded by the rules of the Churches. My beliefs are just this.... if you live your life, by being helpful to other people, and go about your daily life as a friend to all, you cannot go far wrong, and you do not need any Religious person to tell you the rights and wrongs pertaining to anything that you do. In all of this I do not need any Preacher, Vicar, or otherwise to tell me any different, because that is what I try to do.|`|uLdmXx3faa	It means struggle.<br>  Like I could be doing jihad on my laundry lol.<br>  But in all seriousness, declaring jihad is only self defense according to the Quran.

I watched those Disney films hundreds of times as I child and I never once noticed anything out of the ordinary or was affected in anyway by these so called subliminal messages. I think you'll find it's a product of a mischievous animator and the result of some wannabe conspiracist with too much time on their hands.

Subliminal messages have been proven to be ineffective, in any case. The brain simply doesn't pick up on them.<br>  <br>  If Disney was going to include any subliminal messages at all in its movies, surely it would be along the lines of "buy our DVDs", or "visit Disney World", or things to that effect. What would they gain from sneaking PG rated images and words into their kids movies?<br>  <br>  The thing in the Little Mermaid was actually the guy's knee for heavens sake, and the other examples (with one exception - see below) are similarly false. It's just a case of people seeing what they want to see in these movies. It's a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia (look it up).<br>  <br>  I've looked at that Lion King image several times and I still can't see the word SEX, so heaven knows how it's supposed to filter into my subconscious or whatever. I guess the person who saw SEX in that image must have had sex on the brain at the time.<br>  <br>  The only genuine example of a dodgy image being included in a Disney movie was the topless woman in The Rescuers, and that was a prank by an animator, completely unsanctioned by Disney. It's impossible to see unless you go through the movie on freeze frame, and indeed it wasn't spotted until the movie came out on video. Once it was discovered, it was removed from the movie. (Not that I think a womans boobs count as a "dangerous message" in any case - surely every child watching the movie would have seen, and indeed sucked milk from, his/her own mother's breasts? It's a PG rated image in a kids movie, big deal.)

Change is good for business. A lack of change isn't. "Congress funds highway bill" is news, adjournment isn't. Those who favor change, which traditionally are liberal, get a slight benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  In addition, the media tends to attract "I want to change the world" personalities. Politics and teaching also appeals to these people. These people (see above) want to alter the status quo, and I think that slight bias does come up.<br>  <br>  That all said, bias is the most overrated subject out there. There are far fewer opportunities than you'd think to slant the news. Most stories are basic facts. Most stories report those facts. In addition, some can't tell the difference between news and commentary. So when these people see a comment they disagree with, they think the news is slanted.|`|AA10199189	the media report news, which frequently consists of the wrongdoing of elected officials and businessmen and others in the spotlight (athletes, celebs)<br>  <br>  so a journalist must have a certain attitude - namely, not to go along with the status quo, not to permit oneself to be co-opted by people with money or power etc.  and a journalist must expose the truth - truthfully, factually.<br>  <br>  since many people thereby exposed are members of the establishment, they scream "left wing" at every opportunity.<br>  <br>  a proper journalist leaves his or her political biases at home.  at work, only the truth matters.<br>  <br>  but you don't like that so you are upset.  but  it has nothing to do with parties.  when the dems do something stupid it too will be exposed.<br>  <br>  and you may wonder about the current "obama mania".  it is a function of a surprise win by someone who is not just a political outsider but also a black american. so you can see why there continue to be articles about him at every turn.<br>  <br>  <br>  think of this:  if the dems had had as inept, corrupt and calculating an administration the past eight years as was provided by the republicans, then the media would have been jumping all over them, instead/.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	George Bush, Sarah Palin, Sean Hanity, Rush Limbaugh.

They go into it thinking they won't get attached to a child who is not really their biological child and there are times when they change their mind.  Carrying a child is a very emotional thing and you do bond with the unborn child you are so much a part of for 9 months.  They are required to go for counselling to be sure they are suitable for the service and I guess there are times when it doesn't work out.<br>  <br>  I think that being a surrogate would be difficult in many ways but have seen where a sister or even a mother of the women who wanted a baby but was unable to have one due to a medical condition or infertility was able to have a child by donating eggs and having one of them carry the baby to term.  It is a very unselfish thing to do when you know someone cannot be a mother without the help of a surrogate (maybe adoption isn't even available to them).  These women have to go for counselling and they take the situation very seriously.  If my daughter or daughter-in-law could not carry a child and I was healthy, I would certainly consider becoming a surrogate for them.  I have had my children, had healthy pregnancies and enjoyed carrying my children.  It would be a sacrifice in some ways but would be a gift which would bring happiness to my children and I would gain a grandchild in the process.  That is one way I would be able to accept the idea.  Another way might be that if I had a very close friend who couldn't carry but who could donate the eggs, had a husband who would donate the sperm to be administered by a doctor; then that would be something I would also consider.  It wouldn't be my child; I would only be carrying it for them and I would be happy to be able to do it.  Some would never consider it for any reason whatsoever but I would.|`|J7btjSxaaa	You don't understand because you're not sympathizing with them.

Largely preventable if you use condoms and don't sh*g around|`|0f76ac15c25ca69ecd52059f55fc0ffeaa	jade goody. a nobody. right place. right time. shows the culture of "modern britain". why isn't my father in law all over the papers. he was a professional footballer for hereford county football club in the 60's and had throat cancer 3 years ago. total crap. people need to get on with their own lives and stop taking so much notice of what the media shove at you.|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	she (in my opinion) isn't a real nice girl, but no one would ever wish that on even there worse enemy<br>  <br>  I guess it is also got to with the Celebrity (factor) thing, and as we "know" her in public life from the Big Brother series, some people have a fondness for her, and it is very sad to see any ones' life ebbing away like that...<br>  <br>  but on a positive side, (and not taken anything away from other persons that have gone through this) she is making everyone aware of the shite that can happen ant anytime in your life!|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	because shes someone everyone knows about and has seen her be successful and we know her children. its a story basically. a sad story.|`|CceiP7q5aa	i dunoo, to me its weird that she doesnt have long left to live and shes doing all these interviews?|`|AA11414292	JG AND MC are playing the public for a bunch of mugs.<br>  Wake up you are being conned|`|BP5ykmAmaa	i think alot of the pity is maybe aimed at her sons and the fact that she wont see them grow up and they wont remember her that well. <br>  as a mum myself that is my greatest fear and thats why i feel sorry for her. cancer is a horrible thing that i wouldnt wish on my worst enemy and whilst i was never a jade fan, the thought of someone so young and with such a young family going through this is awful. <br>  i dont think she was being intentionlly racist on BB i feel she was just ignorant and oblivious to the feelings of others rather than deliberatley using racism as  a form of attakc and if shilpa can forgive when she was te target then i feel others should too. <br>  Jade now has to do what she can to secure her sons future, which she is doing by making this documentary and living in the public view. Again as a mum if it means financial security for her boys then fair play, ok not eveyrone has the means to do this, but she has so why not use them, and as you say she is raising public awareness too.<br>  my mother in law died from cervical cancer and it was an awful thing to watch.<br>  whilst i am still no jade fan , i wish her well and hope that she has everything sorted out for her children and can make  a few more memories for them before her time finally comes!|`|Gge69PK0aa	British staple brain diet.

I really do not understand peoples bitterness about something that does not affect them|`|ISjFdI1taa	Do you mean you can't pity a young woman with 2 small children who is dying of cancer because of a mildly racist comment that she made that she has apologised for and for which she has been forgiven?<br>  I can pity her because I have 2 small kids and my mother died of cancer which was a horrific end.  <br>  It's her life and her death so she can do what she wants as far as I'm concerned - and I don't have to read the news articles or watch her on the news if I don't want to.<br>  I hate racism in any form but I believe she paid the price for her stupid behaviour at the time.|`|yCgytwdvaa	Why not, this young woman is dying of cancer.<br>  Decent people would feel sympathy for anyone with this condition, particularly if someone close to them had suffered in similar fashion.<br>  Jade deserved the criticism she got last year but her determination to use her last weeks of life to ensure that her kids will be well provided for has impressed me tremendously.<br>  Edit:Instamatikk: You cannot promote awareness by remaining silent.|`|RKUrIHI5aa	Where has she not shown dignity since finding out she has cancer? She's living out her final days in the media spotlight (her choice) in order to try and provide for her children once she dies.<br>  <br>  Btw, she isn't a racist.|`|VUfT35UQaa	I TOTALLY agree with you. The only good that has come from this is that more woman are getting tested for cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  I watched the racism controversy with disgust, being British with all my ancestry in India. The worst part for me was that this woman (who was famous for being famous, then famous for being racist, and now famous for being a famous racist who happens to have a tragic disease that kills people who are worth a lot more than her) made people think it was okay for people to behave in such appalling ways to others. In my school, us all being 13 and 14, most of us watched the program either because it was entertaining or because it was in the news and of media interest. Some girls (who are white and British) proudly defended Jade Goody saying that she had every right to be angry at Shilpa, and told all who disagreed that Shilpa should "Go back to her *own* country if she didn't like it in *ours*!"<br>  <br>  I personally have become more aware that karma will come back to bite you and make you a victim of something horrible, if you victimize others.<br>  <br>  I know I may get a lot of thumbs downs, but in my opinion, she was a bad RACIST person who should not be in the papers so much, they should do a story about a good person (who had helped others instead of hurting them and inspired love and not racial hatred) who is living with cancer.|`|AA10849898	I have cancer, and I admire what she is doing for her kids future, and helping with awareness,people are showing pity because she is in the limelight, if she wasn't where would the pity be then? The media and Jade are using each other, but ultimately its the public insatiability for instant news thats as bad!Regarding the racist slur, you should really get all the facts, its not true!|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Alistair my condolences regarding your Uncle.<br>  <br>  I understand your point of view regarding racism and cancer.<br>  <br>  As a nurse i have seen many people die from cancer both young and older people and it is a cruel and terrifying disease.<br>  <br>  I have great respect and empathy for anyone with cancer as it is a huge battle and so scary.<br>  <br>  I think that Jade is coping with her cancer in the only way she feels that she can and that is by being in the public eye and raising money.<br>  <br>  The younger people I nursed were scared of the disease but many seemed more upset about how their loved ones would cope with them gone (dead). <br>  Jade reportedly had a horrendous upbringing and I think she needs to know that her two sons will be provided for and that their will be enough money for them to live a long comfortable life without any financial hardship. She may well donate to charity too who knows. It is up to her. <br>  Some say she is not being dignified by showing all on TV and flaunting her cancer at people??? I actually think she is being brave as it must be difficult showing yourself losing your hair and throwing up??? <br>  <br>  The huge pity comes from her simply being so young and that she will not see her children grow up, graduate, marry etc. It is always tragic for anyone to die. A young Mother to die is also so dreadful.<br>  <br>  Have you heard of the Caron keating foundation??? That is a foundation that raises money for people with cancers. Take a look at the website.|`|JmdnlQsHaa	her dad died of a heroin overdose, her mums a lesbian drug addict, and now shes gonna die before shes 30.  she hasnt exactly had the greatest life.  maybe thats why people feel sympathy for her|`|0NcnWHz1aa	<a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai8NQuW6tstgL4rqxBUwrwYgBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222140934AADrb1Q">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Muy nan Died Of Cancer She Didn't Get In News Papers Or Get Special Treatment not being outters but for gods sake shes nopt even really a celebrity (i feel bad though)|`|Uz16kQEYaa	She is showing the world the harsh reality of this demoralising,degrading disease.I hope it shocks millions of women into screening.Good on her for being brave enough to show her pain in public.If it makes more people aware,,all the better for others,don't you think?|`|mno4Qd5paa	Does your bitterness and hate run so deep that you can't have feeling for some one who is dying? What is done is done soon she will be just a memory in your tormented mind.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Your view doesn't matter to be honest, because despite what you say, she's still getting on with the rest of her life however long it may be, and she is still doing what she planned and intended on doing...so just deal with it.<br>  <br>  She isn't even racist! Open your eyes, have you ever come across real racism before? Jesus, you would be shocked.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Right, that is what you call racist, but what Jade said was just ignorant, she isn't the brightest person in the world but it's not like she's a member of the KKK.<br>  Plus, when confronted she took full responsibility for what she'd said and aplogised, which is more than what Jo, Jack or Danielle did, in my opinion they were the real racist ones.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	You know I really don't get this dying with dignity bollocks.Who is that to satisfy?You,the onlooker.Selfish much?<br>  <br>  So she made what was perceived to be a racist comment and apologised for it and for her behaviour.The person on the receiving end accepted her apology graciously.Yet you can't forgive her?!Maybe there are some lessons for you to learn from both these women.<br>  <br>  I grew up in the heart of Glasgow too.Do you seriously think only people from poor areas are racist?I think you'll find even the blue blooded lot are not averse to the odd racist comment.
9SB2Y5r8aa	Yes.<br>  >>> israel  is  committed hundreds of WAR CRIMES in Gaza & SHOULD be severely punished for it   ....|`|7zZZEUxqaa	Because the Israelis are bunch of terrorist. They kill, slaughter, destroy and burn building with its inhabitants while the whole world is applauding them.|`|tguEmxVyaa	LOL. You don't bring conventional rockets to a F16 Jet fight..I love the smell of White Phosphorus in the morning..|`|fFq68dJYaa	Maybe Hamas should try not launching missiles? That might help if they don't want to be bombarded in return.<br>  <br>  As for legality of using white phosporus and DIME bombs - this topic was coming up again and again. So far, there is no proof of illegal usage of these weapons (for that matter, there are no regulations about DIME weaponry to begin with). If there is - sue Israel.|`|0Y6CqSliaa	Because if Hamas got a hold of anything more then a conventional rocket, guess where it would end up?<br>  <br>  There is no proof of the DIME bomb being used....Or being existent.<br>  And white phosphorus was not used as a weapon- but as a smokescreen.<br>  White phosporus produces nothing more then small burns if you are dumb enough to stand outside and feel it fall on you.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	'Studies indicate that HMTA embedded in the body disrupts biochemistry and rapidly causes cancer."<br>  <br>  Sounds like a discouragement to war. So don't provoke one if your enemy has such weapons.<br>  <br>  "While White Phosphorus is banned as a weapon against civilians areas"<br>  <br>  By whom? The Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons states:<br>  <br>  Quote<br>  "Protocol III on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Incendiary Weapons prohibits, in all circumstances, making the civilian population as such, individual civilians or civilian objects, the object of attack by any weapon or munition which is primarily designed to set fire to objects or to cause burn injury to persons through the action of flame, heat or a combination thereof, produced by a chemical reaction of a substance delivered on the target."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_Certain_Conventional_Weapons#Protocol_III:_Incendiary_Weapons" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_...</a><br>  <br>  unquote<br>  <br>  Not the same thing as banning all use of white phosphorous in civilians areas. White phosphorous does have legitimate use for generating smoke, indicating targets for artillery (spotting), and illumination.<br>  <br>  "If israeli is claiming that its fight was a reply to Hamas rockets ,which is very small conventional rockets"<br>  <br>  Do you think that if Isael responded with rockets, Hamas would stop firing rockets at Israel? How irrational.<br>  <br>  "Doesn't that mean that israel committed hundreds of WAR CRIMES in Gaza"<br>  <br>  No it doesn't. In fact Israel acted with considerable restraint and should be commended for its efforts in minimizing civilian casualties.<br>  <br>  The only war crimes being committed are by Hamas. One for deliberately targeting civilians with rockets. Two for deliberately putting the civilians in Gaza in harms way. Three for trying to instigate an atrocity by Israel against the civilians of Gaza.|`|2d4d4d8f449f8266d3033948651354acaa	Because they have those weapons and hamas doesn't. The whole relationship is built on a massive difference in military power, by trying to blame Israel for WAR CRIMES you take attention away from the real issues - The UN is never going to take Israel into account, so why bother banging on about it - deal with issues you can have an influence on.|`|rUk58ywKaa	You ever heard the phrase 'overwhelming force'?  That is the way to successfully wage a war.<br>  If someone stands in front of you and slaps you over and over again, eventually you are going to get pissed off.  When you do are you going to just slap them back, or would you elevate it to the next level and punch them?  <br>  Most people would punch.|`|AA10153636	I someone comes at me with a stick with a nail in it and I have a 357 magnum in my pocket, do you think I am going to look for a stick..<br>  Don't be silly, war is not a game and when you try to play with the big boys you can get hurt..|`|AA10294901	Why don't you condemn the terrorists in Gaza for their war crimes for launching the rocket that caused the retaliation by Israel?
