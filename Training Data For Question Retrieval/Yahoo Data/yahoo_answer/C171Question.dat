It can be more if the situation warrants, like if the do something really bad I might spank more than that. i make sure its enough so that there is discomfort but i don't leave marks, that would be abuse. they sometimes cry, especially if the only have underpants on when they're spanked. a spanking is supposed to hurt, right? how much do your spankings hurt? btw, a spanking should only be with the hand on the bottom.

20090222161245AA8bmVu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about mucus plug, does anyone here really know?	Ok, im a little bit confused. Everywhere I look i get conflicting information regarding the "mucus plug". I know why our cervix creates one to protect the baby but when u lose it in the final weeks of pregnancy does that mean u are dilating? or what? I would assume if u lose it u automatically dilate because it is what keeps the cervix closed. but i hear some women say u can lose it and not dilate or u can dilate without losing it..how is this? if the cervix is opening the mucus plug has to come out and if your mucuc plug comes out then u must dilate. can someone who actually knows the details explain this to me because im confused!

20090222053526AA5iEfZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	16 Month Old Son - Is It Time To Let Him Cry Himself To Sleep?	Hi Everybody,      We have a very high maintenance 16 month old son. He is getting to the point now where he literally walks in circles all day crying. His eyes look terrible, and it's very evident that he's becoming sleep deprived.      At night it's even worse. He will go down for bed at 8:00 or so. His Mother, My Wife, rocks him to sleep and then places him in to his bed.       He will be up every night between 10:30 and 11:00, and it just gets worse throughout the night. He will be up, crying in his bed, every hour at maximum. He wakes, and cries, between 5 and 20 times a night.      It's really taking it's toll on us all. We made the major mistake of putting him in to a "big boy bed" (half rails, low to the ground) a few months ago, tossing out his old crib.      As I type my Wife is on her way to the store to buy a new crib, and after reading a book on children's sleep we have decided to let him CRY IT OUT (CIO).      Would anybody be willing to share with me stories on success, or failure with this method?      I know, we know that it's going to be VERY hard at first to just listen to him cry. But at 16 months old something has to give. We cannot keep going like this.       Thank you all for your help and answer.

My dream was that my wife was in the hospital getting ready to have our children but there was something wrong. I didnt get to know what the problem was but we had to choose between her and the babies. She could have the babies but she would have to die. She had already decided that she would have the babies anyway and i would do just fine without her. I didnt want her to die and tried to tell her (i wasnt trying to be rude but i was scared) that we could try for more and she didnt have to die. My wife is very stubborn tho and wouldnt have that so after pacing for forever i told the doc to go ahead and let her birth the babies. She did and died. i was terrified and cried now having to raise three children (boy, boy, girl) by myself. I woke up tearful. My wife is near her due date and she's healthy and the babies are healthy. I know everything will be fine but I'm terrified somethin will go wrong and we will have to choose! help me!

If they have something to eat, he will throw a fit until he is given something also.

To backtrack, the man shes dating is 15 years older than her, has a 7 year old son with his ex wife and seems like a wonderful dad. She can't stand the fact that his ex-wife is so involved in his life being "controlling" at times, and switching her plans last second since she knows he will be there for his son. She wants to have a child with him now, knowing his ex will hate that and knowing then she will back off and be responsible, but she told me they talked about it and he's not ready yet.   Since the start of the year shes been....ok get ready for this...sticking his semen inside of her after he ejaculates (pulls out). If they use a condom she will take it put it inside. I'm afraid she's not ready, even though I don't like this guy, I know he will be there no matter what happens. I'm also worried b/c she's the kind of person who can live with her decision. I'm not going to tell the guy anything, I'm worried about her life....what do I say...what do I do?

20090222160240AA2Jk7N	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it bad etiquette to specify "no gifts"?	We're planning my son's 2nd birthday party, and really don't want our friends/the parents of his friends to bring gifts.  Besides the fact that we're all still in the "semi-poor semi-college student" life, I don't want the focus of a party and a birthday to be on gifts, but on having fun and celebrating.        So, is it okay to specify "no gifts"?  I know it's bad etiquette to express what types of gifts, and I know it's bad manners to expect any gifts at all, so would those in turn also make it bad manners to clarify that we don't want any gifts because that implies a previous expectation of gifts?        Aggh!
20090222135143AA6mYON	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should this mother do?	What should a mother do when the father of her baby daughter, if she has the following choices.            A:  Have a family plan just Italians.  Informal visitations and financial arrangements, just like in Sicily Italy.  The baby daughter can live with her mother.  You will not get any court ordered child support.  This will be arranged with out going to court just like in Sicily Italy.        B:  Give the father 50/50 custody and nobody will pay the other child support.  This is the law in Belgium.        C:  He will never see his daughter again with out your (mothers consent) again and he will live in the US.  You will not ask for child support or take any legal action against him.        D:  He will leave the country if you the mother will ever ask for child support trough the courts.  The US State Department will tell you since he is a foreign national, or a US Citizen who has a passport of another country, he can never be deported by the US.  Any lawyer will tell you that you will never get any child support from him ever, and you never have to deal with him again.  The only thing that you can do is take away his US Passport for not paying child support.  You can always get him arrested if he ever sets foot on US soil again.  He will do this, because it is the only way he does not have deal with the CSA Child Support Agency again.

And i already know how i'm going to raise my child, no rules, no punishments, just love and connection. All that.      But i'm still kind of freaked out, and i don't know why! I mean, how do i tell my parents? My friends?    This is just happening fast.   Any help?

20090222160254AAY2jdJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My fiance's 10 year old niece keeps trying to use my makeup despite me saying no.?	I've tried talking to her mum about it but she keeps saying she's going to use makeup at some point so she might as well start now. It annoys me that her mum isn't doing anything because I barely have any makeup as my complexion is really clear, I just have it for confidence as I have a scar down the side of my face. I've been told I'm making a big deal out of nothing. But she doesn't respect my space in house (the niece and her mum live with us in our house for nothing) or in my studio.       Any ideas how I can stop her destroying my makeup?
20090222121619AAdpWVB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I had a c-section 4 weeks ago. Question about incision?	Everyone else that I've talked to who had a c-section said that their area was numb for a really long time. But I've never had any numbness at all. When I look at it in the mirror, it looks like it's healing well, but I can definitely feel it. Is it a problem that it's not numb? It's not like it hurts; it's tender and sensitive for sure, but not painful, but I'm just wondering if it's supposed to be numb like it was for everyone else.

20090222125439AA0eIEg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could you be pregnant if you have an infection?	My wife and I have been trying to have a baby. she is 10 days late. She's showing a lot of early pregnancy symptoms (sore tender breasts, noticeable blue viens on breasts, nausea, frequent urination). She went to the doctor yesterday because she also has missed her period. The test was negative but the doctor said it might still be too early to test. He also said she has a bacterial infection. Could she be pregnant with an infection? If so, could that delay a positive result?
20090222133719AAfoliq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Can a child learn to speak properly when her parents both have speech problems?	My friend and her husband both have speech problems due to medical issues. There is nothing medically wrong with their child, so she should be able to speak clearly. But I am wondering about it though because don't children learn to speak from hearing others? That's how they learn pronunciations and accents. I know she will hear other people speak, but she will hear her parents the most.

20090222125443AAHWdbF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	? For married/engaged people: how do I know we are on the road to an engagement?	I'm very in love with my bf. We met in college a year ago and started dating 6 months ago. He's so perfect, there is no one else I would ever want to be with besides him, I think he likes me just as much. I'm 23, he's 22. He says he can't see himself getting married for a while, but I am a very patient person, besides I can't get married anytime in the near future anyway, I need to finish school and secure a job. But how were your experiences when you were dating the one you are with now? How long did you date for? When was the proposal? Were you expecting it? Did you always know you would end up together? Did you have to work for the other persons affection? Did they call you everyday? What was their behavior towards you like? What are some ways to tell we are heading in that direction?

My son just came back from being with his dad, He only spends 1 weekend with his dad every 3 or 4 months and today he told me that he didn't get a bath while he was with his daddy and that he took a shower with him. He does this every time he takes my son inspite of me asking him to not shower with him and to provide him his own bed. He also said he sleeps with his dad and the new wife too (who he made my son call MOM...they've been together for 1 year now)       Is it wrong of me to be upset that my son is eye height at my ex's privates and I feel it's inappropriate? Bathtime is always a production at our house because it's one of my son's favorite times. Am I over reacting? We're about to go to mediation and court soon, is it something worth bringing up?

20090222163212AAJXF8K	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Why isn't adoption a man's right to chose?	I just read a question about a someone who thinks women alone should be allowed to choose adoption for her child, even when the father does not agree.....      Why not the same for men. Once the child is physically separated from her child, why can't a father choose adoption without the mother consent?      Please explain the double standard?      Does a child ONLY "belong" to the mother?       Hell, men usually lose their "Choice" to parent, weather it be through adoption of divorce.      Is anyone else outraged about this?
20090222163744AAaYBu8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Switch between similac advance and similac early shield?	my son switched between breast milk at 7 weeks to enfamil then parents choice w/ no problems at all. then at 3 months he switched to regular similac advance, also w/ no problems.   The early shield kind came out and i was wanting to try it so i got a jug of ready to eat kind. that lasted about a day and a half (5 eight oz bottles) He just finished the last bottle this morning and now is back to regular powder kind of similac advance. Starting last night and especially today, he's been screaming almost non stop and will not sleep or eat much.   He seems to be passing gas fine and i burp him regularly. Could this be from the brief switch? if so, is it due to the difference between powder and ready to drink or the difference between similac advance and similac early sheild? He finally fell asleep not too long ago. he was way over due for a nap.   i had dismissed this as simple teething b/c sometimes his teething does get that intense but oragel, tylenol, teething tablets ect. aren't making any progress or helping. if it is from the switch, what can i do for him? will mylecon help at all?

20090222165946AAJGwDt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Can anyone give suggestions on what to do to help?	I have a friend, who has not seen or spoken to her daughter in over a year. She has also not seen her new Grandson. This lady lived for her children, raised them as a single parent after their father walked out. The father never paid one cent in Child Support.       Her son broke up with his girlfriend who was too lazy to work and she and her brother and sisters were sponging off the man. This girlfriend said she couldn't work because she had mild endometriosis. The mother told the girlfriend one day that her daughter has asthma, nocturnal epilepsy and severe endometriosis and has never let any of these conditions stop her.  She was an honour roll student, and went on the additional education, has worked everyday of her life since leaving college and has never complained or said one word about her medical conditions preventing her from doing anything. The girlfriend flew into a rage, told the mother that both her son and daughter had told her that they hated their mothers f**king guts and wished she was dead.  The mother told me she considered the source,and never thought anything about it. The girlfriend told the daughter a whole pack of lies, saying the mother had told her all sorts of really awful things about her, the daughter.       However the daughter said this is why she won't talk to her mother and why her mother has never seen the Grandson. This is what you do to your mother if she is a crack whore, a sexual predator, a criminal or some other really despicable criminal person.  It's not something you do because of gossip a trouble maker told you. I know some of you will think there has to be more to it, there isn't. I have been stewing over this for months trying to think if there is something I can do to help.  I can't contact the daughter as her mother doesn't even know where she lives or what her phone number is. Has anyone ever faced a situation like this and does anyone have any advise?
20090222164020AATqL2w	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How to prepare for a 2 yr old boy's stay?	My friend is coming to visit us for 3 months with her 2 yr old son (he's going to turn 2 here). I got a toddler seat for the car and the toddler bed and the safety rail for the stairs and a walking pram.    1. Is that enough? Or am I forgetting something that I need to buy to have in the house for a 2yr old? E.G.: Is a highchair necessary? What else is there?   2. What kind of toys or activities should I have to make sure the kid doesn't get bored?   Thank you!

20090222163607AARzVBA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	For those of you who's children tried to ski/snowboard, how many of them actually liked it?	We just got back from Vermont, and had all my children (including the neighbor who came along), except baby Grace, choose to try either snowboarding or skiing  They had a 2-hour lesson on Saturday, then had the choice to go to another lesson on Sunday if they liked it. Turns out, out of all 8 that tried it, we only had 3 not go back Sunday. What about you? How was the turn-out?
20090222182332AAf3p8u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Did we do the right thing? What would you have done in this situation?	So we were just settling back home after vacation when my husband and I heard this ear-splitting scream. He hops our fence and across the yard behind us to get to the scream. I jump in the car and meet him there. By then, there is a 7 or 8 year old little boy in the car crying and screaming like I've never heard before (and I have 8 children, I thought I've heard it all). Anyway, my husband wanted to see what happened, so he runs up to the car. It is stoping, so my husband punches the sides to get him to finally stop. I'm about ready to call the police anyway but the man takes the liberty of calling to report my husband. At this point we could careless, we're just trying to make sure this child is safe. It was total madness. The man was threatening to fight my husband. He was trying to get the liscense plate, just in case he took off. I was trying to make sure the man stayed in his car and talk to the little boy and make sure he's not going to be tramatized by this. I was just amazed at the lack of care for the entire situation by neighbors that live much closer than us. People stood at their windows and watched, but only one person came out to help along with 2 people driving by (both I happened to be friends with).       What would you have done? I know there is always a risk of the person having a gun, but there is also the risk of a child getting hurt/killed.
20090222172902AAnoQ4q	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I'm jealous of my friend & my dad always implies I'm gonna fail the 8th grade...?	First; my friend lost like 20 pounds over the summer & now she's like super thin & its annoying cause she always complains she is fat. Well I'm over weight not majorly but definetly not skinny. She and her friend who is like 12 go and take pictures of themselves in short shorts and with there shirts rolled up with there belly showing. I'm really jealous of her that she can take those kind of pictures. And she goes "Oh my gosh! Payton did you see my new pictures on myspace!" and I go "Yeah the ones where you & ____ look like whores" I said that cause I was jealous & she does look like one! Its terrible! She thinks she's so sexy but shes flat on her butt and her bust!       DAD SITUATION!    I'm not good in school, I work hard sometimes but other times I slack. I try tot focus but I hate it so I just say screw it. So today I went to the mall & I had homework. Like 20 minutes ago I went out in the living room to get my moms computer. She was on it & I asked for it, and I told my dad that I needed it for homework. He then said then you shouldn't have gone to the mall. My mom gave me her computer and he said as I was walking out "I really can't take another year at 'school name'" I was so angry cause he always implies that I'm gonna fail the 8th grade and not go on to high school. Its so frikin annoying and when I was walking out I said "Wow dad thanks for having faith in me. I love you too!" He was trying to say something to me but I was just saying over him I love you too. I don't give a crap about him whenever he does that! I don't know what to do!!?!      My questions   Is that skankyish what my friend did?   Am I being stupid for being jealous of her?

20090222172751AAEPpyj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about my newborns formula intake?	My son is 11 days old and was 8 pds 10 oz a birth.  We are very confused about formula amount.  We started him on 2 oz every 3 hrs.  the ped said to gradually up this amount 1/2 oz at a time.  We have him up to 2 1/2 oz every 3 hrs now.  But, he had been fussy all day long for two days and not sleeping as much.  However, we cant wake him to eat for the middle of the night feedings.  He is also only having a bowel movement every other day, but she also said this was normal for a formula feed baby.      We do not feel confident with our ped for several others reasons than the formula and are looking for a new one.  In the meantime and after consulting books, we have read it should be 2-4 oz.  Our parents say he should be getting double what he is???      We are so confused because the ped said he was on the high side at 2 oz when he had his appoitment at 6 days.   Should we up him to 3 oz and see if he calms?  We really cant tell when he is full because he loves to suck on his pacifier endlessly.  Sometimes when he is crying though, he will refuse the pacifier after a couple sucks.  Does this mean he is hungry?

20090222170840AAiuKzd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Am I spoiled? My mum said I am.?	So I'm fifteen, my family isn't that well off at the moment, never has been really rich. I have regular babysitting jobs and sometimes get pocket money (maybe $20 depending on how much I look after my brothers, and not even every month.) My dad lives in England and I went over to see him during Feb. vacation. He has more money than us, but isn't really contributing as much as he should to my mum. While I was there I got some Doc Martens with Christmas money from my family in England (in pounds, so if I never spent it it would just be lying there. Anyways they were 60 pounds which comes to about 120 bucks.) My old iPod, which I'd only had for a year, broke because I dropped it, so I bought a new one. My mum thinks that makes me spoiled. The ipod money, I earned from babysitting. NONE of it was from her, so do you think this is fair for her to say to me?

I don't know if other people feel this but when baby cries or I think about her my nipples will literally ache. But thats not my question. My question is - Its starting to happen more frequently (maybe more often after my 2.5week old baby girl is done eating). Could this be something bad like mastitis or normal? I know I should talk to my doctor, and I will at my appointment on Tuesday, I'm just curious.
20090222175725AA3D9u0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast Feeding 2.5week Old Question?	Doc says I'm supposed to feed her every 2-3 hours. I seriously think she's going through a growth spurt or appetite change right now because she's eating way more than she ever used to. So my question is, is it everything 2-3 hours from the minute you started feeding, or stopped feeding? I started nursing Mya at 6:15 and she wasn't done until 6:55. It also takes so long because I need to burp her alot (due to overeating). So should I feed her at 8-9, or 9-10? She is just now starting to fall asleep (7:56). So my main question is every 2-3 hours from when you started nursing or when she's finished eating?       Thanks! :D

20090222183441AApww7Z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Drinking and breastfeeding?	Why do some people insist you cannot drink alcohol if you are breastfeeding?  You are allowed to have 1-2 drinks with no worries at all, but you can have more than that if you want.  I have read that you cannot take care of your baby if you are under the influence, and you cannot feed your baby if you have had more than 1-2 drinks, etc.  Well, of course not, but there are ways around this.  If I want to have more than 1-2 drinks, I will not be around my children for one thing, and for another I would have a trusted, caring, responsible adult caring for my children while I am away, and for a third, I would leave bottles of expressed milk for my baby to drink until my system has cleared any alcohol.  If you do all of those things you most certainly can go out and have drinks with no guilt.  There is no reason not to as long as you have all your responsibilities covered at home.  So, my question is why do most web sites/people, etc say one or two drinks is okay but make you feel like a horrible mother if you want an occasional night out with the girls.  I breastfed all my children but still enjoy an occasional night out.

20090222175815AAdmXyA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is my 8 month old suddenly fighting naptime?	Is it typical around 8 months for a baby to fight taking naps during the day?  She was doing great up until about a week ago.  Now I can't get her down for naps without a fight.  Sometimes she even skips a nap every now and then.        Just want to know if this is common around 8 months old.
20090222170818AAIGvRJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 7 month old used to sleep through the night?	He used to sleep from 9 PM to 8AM. The last couple of nights he's been waking up 6 or 7 times a night wanting a few sips from his bottle. He's not really awake enough to finish it so he wakes up more than once. So I stay up a lot of the night because I know he's going to wake up again. He's eating a lot more also, especially at breakfast.   Could this be a growth spurt or is it going to last a while? It's not a big deal, but I miss going to work and actually functioning. lol

20090222163636AAOa1nr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should a 14 month old still be drinking milk? How much, if so?	My daughter is 14 months old and my mother-in-law says we should start taking her off milk. She gets 3 8oz bottles of 2% a day. Morning, afternoon, and bed time. We are 1st time parents so really don't know what to do. She does still take the milk in a bottle, and wont take it out of a cup, only juice in a cup. I know she needs to be off the milk bottle, but what about in a cup? If she does not drink milk I am concerned about the amount of liquid she will be taking in and the calcium and vitamins on the milk she cannot get from juice. She is still on baby food as well. Any suggestions will greatly be appreciated.      The juice is 3-1 water to juice!

It isn't smoky in there, cuz the wood stove is closed, but when they clean the ashes out, idk if it will be good for the baby's lungs.

My body has always been the same before I have a period, tingling breasts (achy) at times, the odd pimple, lots of clear watery CM and that is about it.      But this month I have really sore breasts. Have not had it like this before! So sore that they hurt when my clothing rubs, or even air on them hurts! I am also incredibly gassy, really badly it is so embarrassing! Feel need to pee a lot but not always loads comes out sometimes just a trickle. Really bloated tum that aches, feels 'strange'      Now we have been trying for a baby, but my question is:   Is it possible to always have the same symptoms before a period and then it suddenly changes one month? Or do you think that this could mean I have conceived?

Im 18, just had a baby (turning 3 months in 5 days)      when i was around 7 months along i bled-and sorry to be so graphic but its HOW i bled that worries me:      i went to the restroom, pooped, and on the 1st wipe i saw a lot of blood-like a very heavy period-but then i wiped again and saw no more blood (i mean NO trace of blood whatsoever)   since i was pregnant i got worried even though there was no pain and my baby was still moving...   so i went to the doctor and he said the baby was ok but he was pressing against my cervix so it made me bleed...he gave me pills so i wouldnt have a premature birth and everything was fine after that.      until now...      2 days ago i again went to the restroom, pooped, wiped and on the 1st time there was a lot of blood-and what looked like 2 small clots, but im not even sure they count as clots because they were so small...   then i wiped again and there was no trace of blood...      i started taking contraceptives 3 cycles ago (im on my 3rd pack, i started them when my baby was 3 weeks old)    im taking the pill- its the combined kind (estrogen and progestin)      i have been having really bad nausea, especially in the car like when i was pregnant since maybe 2 weeks before this happened...sometimes i feel very tired...and my last period only lasted 3 days, so i had even told my boyfriend that i might be pregnant again...but we hadnt taken it so seriously until now      any ideas on what this could mean?      heavy implantation bleeding? light miscarriage bleeding? side-effect from the pill?? or possibly my cervix bleeding again for some reason??      im so confused and i dont have insurance right now so i cant go to the doctor

20090222170316AAQMnYB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	22 weeks pregnant and feeling the baby kick.?	I've heard from many women who are 22 weeks pregnant like i am that they feel the baby kick all the time, and that they can even see them kick when watching their stomach. This is not the case for me and it worries me a little. I know she's active cause every time i go to the doctor he tells me she is very active and we see her move throughout the ultrasound, but i think its mostly when she is bothered, like when there is being pressure applied during an ultrasound. I don't feel her move all the time though. There have been times lately when i can identify little movements as distinct kicks (mostly when i'm laying down), but most of the kicks i feel are not strong, just light. They say when you are heavier it takes longer to feel movement, but i was very thin before i was pregnant, and even worked out a lot. i was wondering if maybe my muscle tone prior to pregnancy would have anything to do with it. Is this all normal? Should i be feeling her more? Please help!

I had a miscarriage in Jan. when i was about 5-6 weeks.. and now I've found out I'm pregnant again. I had one period in-between. When I had my miscarriage, I was really stressed all the time & I still think that's why I ended up having one..now I'm scared that's going to happen again. I can't help but stress all the time. Me and my fiance argue, I wouldn't say everyday but at least 3-5 times a week, sometimes it's a little argument but sometimes it turns into a huge fight. I'm really scared I'm going to miscarry again, I'm only 3-4 weeks right now. ( I know it's early, I had my blood drawn at the doc a few days ago) But I can't help but worry about every little thing..if I have a cramp, what was that feeling?.. why do i have this headache? everything. Also, I'm bad at looking everything up on the internet, and it just scares me even more! Did anyone have a lot of stress in their first trimester and NOT have a miscarriage? Or has anyone had stress and had one? What are some ways I can stop stressing so much?

20090222185905AAh95Xj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you trust your kids enough to cosign a loan for college?	I am 19 years old and preparing to transfer from community college to a university for my last two years of undergrad.  I don't qualify for federal student loans because of my FAFSA EFC, and if my parents are willing to take out a PLUS loan at all, it won't be for everything.  So this means private loans, and I need a cosigner.  My parents have expressed deep concern about this and I think they might decide not to do it.      This just seems strange to me.  I've always been a very responsible kid.  I make top grades, I do tons of community service, I'm not presently employed, but I've been before and did very well (I'm between jobs at the moment.)  I'm on the school paper, I'm in rotary club, I get along with my sister, I do what is asked of me.  I haven't done anything outstanding to damage their trust in me.      Would you cosign for your teen/young adult?

My daughter has been sticking her fingurs in her ear and at first i didnt think much of it but tonight my dad said something about her having an ear ache. The first and last time she had an ear infection she didnt do anything till it was really bad and then she would rub her ear on the mattress and not eat. I went out and baught an ear check but im not sure how accurate it is because it said on one of my ears level 1 no fluid then on the other level 3 see doctor but my ears dont hurt. For her both ears read level 2 moniter a few times and a few times no fluid. Im so confussed....Does this thing really work?? Should i just keep an eye on her for a few days checking it every now and then a few times a day??

20090222190207AAP4kGt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do you think parental pressure is more harmful than peer pressure?	Parental pressure as in our parents expecting us to be perfect and to do our best at everything. And forcing their own values onto us.      Peer pressure as in friends and class mates pushing you to do stupid things you do not want to just so you fit in.       Do you think parental pressure can be more damaging? Why?

20090222185558AAq2fdm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Need some advice on how to put the toddler down?	I have a wonderful little 16 month old girl.  Up until recently she was always well behaved.  She is extremely shy and doesn't like strangers.  She's always played well independantly but is definately attached to mommy.  She just recently wants me to hold her constantly!!  I can't put her down for a second without her attaching herself to my leg screaming and i can't move.  I don't know how to handle this.  I think because of my guilt of having to work I probably held her too often.  Now she wants it constantly!  So I know im partially to blame.  How do I break her of this habit?  Im 2 months pregnant with my second and would like to nip this in the bud before the next baby comes...  thanks.

I went to go see my husband on friday the 13th -Monday the 16th. I have a 26 day cycle, If the last day we had sex was the 16th, if my cycle was a 28 day wouldnt i ovulate on the 18-20? since my cycle is 26 days thats mean i ovulated before the 18th right? so if the last day i had sex was the 16th is there a chance that i could be pregnant. My husband and i both want a baby were both 25 my clock is ticking lol I just dont want to get to excited, then i'll get disappointed. my husband drinks when he goes out to the club, i dont smoke or drink, i jog 2.5 miles every other day, were both in the military, he smokes occassionaly, Other than that he is healthy, he exercises, eats healthy. How likely are my chances??
20090222183756AAvflWS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Baby moving is extremely painful?	Im at 35 weeks with my second daughter and third child. I am so very uncomfortable but only when she moves which is a lot. In one way feeling her move is wonderful but since my 25th week its been really less like flutters and rolling like I remember my previous two being ... but more like sharp strong jabs and stretching either all the way into my chest or down onto my bladder which hurts so bad it makes it impossible to walk. She stretches up into my chest and it makes me vomit ... I vomit at least 2 to 5 times a day and can barely eat because when I do its a strain to breathe. I stand up and my legs itch burn and turn purple all the way down to my feet. I haven't really gained much weight I am 180lbs and 6 ft 3 ins so I am still really pretty slender and my belly doesn't poke too much though my uterus is slightly larger than what is expected at this stage according to my doctor. The doctor says shes big... as of Friday 9 lbs 2 oz. but he says he's not worried because I have big children. (son 11 lbs 8 daughter 9 lbs 13 oz) But this one just is so difficult to carry even though she isn't the largest child I have carried. My son was so easy to carry and he was the biggest. Feeling him roll around in there was fun but this one .... ohhhh its so painful. Is there something wrong? Has anyone else experienced this kind of discomfort to this extreme. I mean I'm basically bedridden. My doctor doesn't sound as though he is too concerned but he wants to see me now twice a week. I'm worried about my burning itching purple legs and feet and the vomiting. Has any one else experienced this extreme discomfort with their pregnancies? Does anyone think its due to my age ..(I'm 34)?
20090222183841AAlfvVl	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I might have ruined my family and my father punished me so severely and I'm afraid he'll never forgive me?	I just found this website and I am in desperate need of advice. I think I might have ruined my family tonight.      This afternoon my parents went somewhere with my aunt and uncle, and they all went in my aunt's car, leaving my dad's car behind. He also left his keys. I am 16, and I just got my license but my parents don't let me drive alone yet, but I really wanted to go to my boyfriend's house so I.. pretty much stole my dad's car. I thought no one would notice and it wouldn't be a big deal!      But something HORRIBLE happened. My boyfriend and I went to the mall, and what must have happened is the keys must have fallen out of my purse, and I think someone found them and used the locate car feature to find the car, and they stole the car... I had to call my parents and tell them, and they and my aunt and uncle came to the mall, and they took us to the police station and my parents filed a report, and then my aunt and uncle drove us home..      My mom was crying and my dad wasn't speaking to me, but when we got inside he just started shouting at me and my dad has NEVER shouted at me before, I know that sounds hard to believe but he hasn't! And then he grabbed me and yanked down my pants and underpants and pushed me over his lap and started spanking me REALLY hard and yelling at me about how he might lose his job now cause it was our only car and he doesn't know if he'll be able to get to work and he kept spanking me and spanking me and it hurt SO bad, and I've never been spanked before and it was so embarrassing and I was crying and my mom was crying and my bottom felt like it was on fire and it still kind of does, and when it was over he yelled at me to go to my room.      And so here I am, and I've been up here for a few hours and I don't understand what's going to happen now! Did I ruin my family? My mom was saying things would get worked out in the morning when he can talk to the insurance company but my dad was SO angry and he seemed so worried. Do you think he hates me now? He's never yelled at me before and NEVER spanked me before, I think he must hate me! I'm afraid to go downstairs because I'm afraid I'll get spanked again. I've never been in serious trouble before!!

We only ever had 1 name picked for a boy and 1 for a girl. My aunty recently had a baby girl and used the name we had chosen for a girl. It is the only name my husband likes and he thinks that if we have a girl we can still use it.    I have asked a few people this question and they have said they think we could still use it as we have different surnames and do not se them that often.      We really had out hearts set on this name and i would just like some opinions/ideas about it.   Any other suggestions for girls names would be appreciated also.

It'll go away & then come back a couple seconds later. I tried massaging it, I tried applying pressure, etc... but nothing seems to work.       Is this normal? Is it pregnancy related?

20090222184607AAr3iua	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is my baby on track developmentally?	He is almost nine months, and instead of crawling, he rolls across the floor to get to where he wants to go. He really isn't interested in sitting up to play, he would rather roll everywhere. He does get on his hands and knees and rock back and forth, but he is very efficient at getting around the house by rolling instead. He will roll and then drag himself around in a circle to get to a toy.Is there anything I can do to encourage crawling?       Btw, I did not crawl myself, but my oldest son did. (at 8 months) Ian does try to pull up, but doesn't show any interest at all in crawling???

Then, all of the people in my youth group go upstairs to play a game, and he's hugging and putting his arms around all these other girls. I mean, I was sort of jealous, but I was shocked and sort of angry more than anything. I didn't talk to him about it or anything, but I don't want to seem desparate for him. Cuz I'm not. I just like him. So what happened? Did he lose interest or something?

20090222191335AAJwvHi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Can anyone help me with a cute but not too corny name for a kid's consignment shop?	I'm planning to open a Newborn thru tween consignment/resale shop and I'm stuck for a name. I live in Massachusetts so if you live elsewhere, I could even use the name of one already in existence! I want the name to be catchy but not too corny. I'm renting in a wealthy town so I want the name to imply "upscale" consignment. Here are a few I've thought of...feel free to give your opinions!      Neighborhood Kids   Neighborhood Kids Co-Op   Kids Co-Op   Ben and Abby's Closet (my kids names)   Sharing Closets      I like the words "share" and "Co-Op" as you can tell but I'm not really "married" to them. Also, I plan to give my consignee's a choice between collecting their commission for themselves, or donating a higher percentage to the school or other charity of their choice...so maybe something incorporating a charitable message would work also! Thanks in advance!
