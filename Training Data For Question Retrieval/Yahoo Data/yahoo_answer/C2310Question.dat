20090219171230AAfaXAv	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Is this arrogance, or is this something else?	I often times find myself looking down on people. For instance, this girl, Mandy, was attempting to be friends with me, and she was sort of checking me out, but I look down on her. As a matter of fact, I look down on everyone I meet for the first time. It's all on a subconscious level though. I have a sense of disgust with almost everyone. It's as though I look down on them people are merely sick creatures not worthy of even looking at me. I'm having trouble not looking down on people. It's a natural thing. I don't consciously look at people in disgust. I understand why people say they think I am the type of kid that was fed with a silver spoon his entire life.

20090220162957AAYRLEF	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Help with expository paragraph?	plzz edit and add more into it      How college can be expensive.      Going to college can be expensive. College tuition and room and board can cost anywhere from $2,000 to more than $10,000 per semester, but other expenses make going to college even more expensive. For example, books typically cost between $100 and $500 each term. Materials are also very expensive. Paper, notebooks, writing utensils, and other supplies required often cost more at the college bookstore than at any local discount department store. For instance, a package of notepaper costing $2 at a discount store might cost $5 at a college bookstore. In addition, there are all kinds of special fees added onto the bill at registration time. A college student might have to pay a $50 insurance fee, a $20 activity fee, a $15 fee to the student government association and anywhere from $500 to $100 for parking. There is another fee if a student decides to add or drop classes after registration. The fees never seem to end. There is money wasted for entertaining oneself, for example going to watch movies or eating out or going to water parks in the summer with friends. College can be very expensive because of all the expenses and fees.

20090219184355AALmUAO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What career allows me to genuinely help the sick and the poor?	I am 20 years old and am a junior at a local University. Right now I major in business (Risk Management and Insurance) and simply can no longer go any further with this major as I feel it completely detaches me from who I am. I come home stressed and depressed that I have absolutely nothing in common with people that I come in contact with during my time there. I also feel as though this major is doing nothing but dehumanize me and prepare me to become a white collar slave, who chains and bonds are not of metal but of money. My GPA has remained relatively high during the first two years (3.85) but it's slowly taking a nosedive as my interest in classes dwindles with each passing semester. Right now I am in danger of failing one or two classes, not because I don't understand them (material is cake) but because it takes so much out of me to read the books and notes and force myself to feel like I enjoy it.      So here is my question, what can I possibly major in that will allow me to help the poor and the sick. Something that can make me feel accomplished at the end of the day? I don't mean helping normal people with emotional problems like a psychologist or psychiatrist would, but help people who are in real dire need of help and guidance. Money is of absolutely no issue, so salary is not a concern.

20090219185559AAaSubT	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Need help/advice selecting classes for next year!?	So junior year in high school year is coming out, and so are the registration forms for next year classes and.... I need help =)      So far this sophomore year, I had a rough year with most of my classes, which lead most of my friends and teachers doubting that I cannot succeed in the classes that  I have hope to choose for next year.      So here are the classes I am planning to take (your advice/help is greatly appreciated!):      -The main question I have right now is should I take calculus AP or computer science AP? In the future, I plan to major in a field where technology (mainly computer) is involved. The problem is that teachers/students rarely discuss about this class, which concerns me to that the class is either too easy or useless.    On the other hand, calculus AP is probably the hardest class I am going to experience in my life, and math is definitely not my strongest point. However, I am aware that calculus is essential in most math classes, and that colleges/universities will favor you more if you take calculus.    Please help! Should I take computer science, or the dreaded calculus!?       The last question I have is in the science field-- should I take psychics AP or biology AP. I know this can seem like a useless question, but I am pretty concerned about these classes. As I said before, in the future I plan to major in a field where technology is involved, which ideally leads to psychics being my number one choice. However, I do struggle a lot in math (psychics mostly requires math), and this is the class that is really scaring the heck out of right now.     Nevertheless, biology AP is an ideal choice since most students walk out of the class with an A, but the class has nothing that really interests me   -The other two classes that I am definitely going to take is English AP, and US History AP      If you read all this so far, I really appreciate it. Most of my friends (85%) doubt that I cannot survive next year with straight As, but I believe that I CAN DO IT. This concludes my annoying questions =) Any advices or help would be appreciated      Tyvm if you read this

20090220233126AArpij6	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Rates of change question- what am i doing wrong?	rates of change question- what am i doing wrong?   A cubical block of ice is melting in such a way that each edge decreases steadily by 9.9 cm every hour. At what rate is its volume decreasing when each edge is 5 meters long?      Solution: Let l=l(t) be the length of each edge at time t. Then the volume of the block is given by V = ______ (I said l^3) . Since the length of each edge is changing in time, we conclude that the volume V is also a function of time t. We note that the rate of change of l is constant and that is given as (I wrote dl/dt = 9.9cm) or (I wrote 0.099) m.      Therefore, when each edge is 5 m long, the rate of change of the volume of the ice block is _______ m^3/hr.         I applied the chain rule by:      3(5)^2 * (0.099m) and keep getting the wrong answer. (-7.4m^3/hr) What am i doing wrong?

20090221005628AAXkte3	Education & Reference;Teaching	Guidance counselor is brutal towards me when I needed help?	Okay, I don't know what to do. There's a teacher who's harassing me, Short version of story :      Teacher made us (every student) grade each others papers and I graded a guy's paper who was almost completely flawless and she called me a liar and lazy for not "properly" grading it. I didn't do anything wrong anyway. I did as what she said and she said I was lazy for that..... I find it really offensive and inappropriate for a teacher to call a student 'lazy' and a 'liar' and she's the one who's lazy. She's the teacher, she should be grading the papers, not us. She also said I was using a "blue" pen when I was using a "BLACK" pen and she rolls her eyes at me when I told her that.      So anyways, today, I went to the counselor for some help and my counselor started to be completely brutal to me and say things like I change the story.... I don't know where she got that from. First, I told her the story and she kept interrupting me so obviously, she WOULD have problems understanding it when she didn't even let me finish. Then, she wants ME to TALK to the TEACHER.... Why on earth would I talk to a teacher who calls me a liar and lazy when that teacher herself falsely accuses me of things and refuses to listen when I defend myself. This counselor isn't even a counselor to start with. She was a kindergarten teacher for 9 years and this school hires her....      Anyways, please help. Idk what to do now. It seems like this no-brained counselor doesn't want to help and only want to criticize me and support the teacher because she USED to be a teacher..... Also, don't mention my parents because they abuse me and this is why I'm really sensitive not only to myself but to everyone around me.      I'm getting once-a-week counseling because of things with my parents and such so you don't have to worry and thanks for your concern.

I know I'll have to deal with deferral and housing applications while abroad. This is how I've chosen to do it - so please, don't try to convince me otherwise! It's not worth the time.) My question is this: when applying, should I indicate that I am interested in living in res, or not? If I click yes, does that indicate that I want a place in res for the year I am applying for (2009), or a place when I actually attend the university (which will be 2010, after my exchange)?

I am currently a sophomore with a B+ GPA (3.3) and I haven't taken my SAT's yet but on my PSAT i got a 1700 with no preparation so I think on my real SAT I should be able to get at least a 1900 (I am a good test taker in general, the only reason my GPA isn't higher is because of work not handed in). I am looking to go to NYU for recording arts in which I already have a great portfolio including a completed album which I completely produced and composed and many smaller side projects or works which I am featured on. Also, I'm not sure how serious they take athletics, but for my age I am an excellent track runner and I'm sure I would be very useful on a division III track team such as theirs.

20090221012359AAnkg8l	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How's this for a research report on Birth control?	Katherine McCormick and Birth Control Pioneer, Margaret Sanger teamed up after Katherine’s husband gets diagnosed with Schizophrenia. Katherine did not want to pass in the illness to future children, So that work later led to the invention of the birth control pill in 1906. Around 1918, Condoms became another form of birth control in the United States. By 1921, The U.S Birth Rate drops by half. In the 1960’s the FDA approved that the birth control pill was 100 percent effective but had some terrible side effects. Some of the effects were life treating blood clots. They realized that the dosage was about 10 times too high, which was causing these terrible side effects. By the 2000’s there were many other types and forms of birth control that became effective.    There is no “best” method of birth control. Each type of Birth Control has its pros and cons. There is no method of birth control that can completely prevent pregnancy. It can fail, but there is a greater chance to prevent pregnancy while taking birth control. If you use birth control correctly all the time it could be much more effective. The most effective type of birth control would be abstinence.    How the birth control pill works is you take it the beginning of each menstrual cycle, when your estrogen levels begin to rise. Estrogen helps thicken your uterus lining. About 14 days into the menstrual cycle one of the ovaries release an egg. This is called ovulation. After that another hormone called progesterone, begins to rise. Birth control pills are a fake form of hormones, and prevent ovulation.   The different Birth control methods are:  Continuous abstinence, meaning not having any form of sexual intercourse. This method is 100 percent effective. There’s the male condom, which is 98.9 percent effective. Oral contraceptives, also called “the pill”, which is 95 to 99.9 percent effective. The Mini-Pill, that is 92 to 99.9 percent effective. The Female Condom, which is about 79 to 95 percent effective. Depo-Provera, this method women get a injection, or shot of the hormone Progestin in the arm every 3 months. This method is 97 percent effective. Diaphragm, this form of birth control blocks the sperm from entering into the woman’s cervix and reaching the egg. This is 84 to 94 percent effective.   Some more forms of birth control are, The Contraceptive Sponge, It’s a barrier method that was approved by the FDA; the Sponge is 84 to 91 percent effective. The Patch (Ortho Evra), It’s a skin patch worn on the lower abdomen, or upper body. It releases hormones into the blood stream; you put on a new patch every three weeks. The patch is 98 to 99 percent effective. The NuvaRing is a ring that let’s out hormones. And is 98 to 99 percent effective. The last form of birth control is Emergency Contraception, which is an emergency form of birth control. This pill is also known as “the morning after pill.” The pills are 75 to 89 percent effective.     Some of the disadvantages of birth control method are Amenorrhea (missed period), Irregular bleeding, heavy bleeding, abdominal pain, headaches, nausea, vomiting, blood clots, can contribute to gallstones and rare liver tumors, weight gain, and weight loss. Some of the advantages are it reduces the chance of unintended pregnancy, can be obtained easily, it can improve your menstrual cycle, can protect from forms of cancer, improves bone density, and can protect you from ovarian cysts.

20090221014246AA8pwwq	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Do you know anything about law school admissions?  Would you consider this a good personal statement?	I've given this to a few friends, but none of them are lawyers or law students.  If you know anything about professional writing or just enjoy proof-reading, does this seem well-written and crisp?  It had to be <500 words, so I had to avoid too much detail.  THANKS A LOT!!!          Although my path leading to law school is far from traditional, I know that my life experiences will give me a competitive edge as I fight for my future clients if I am blessed with the privilege to practice law.  As I reflect on my past, it is very apparent that my becoming a prospective law student is indicative of a noteworthy and lasting transformation. Seven years ago I was an immature and aimless underachiever, but I’ve developed into a mature, self-disciplined leader with a proven record of excellence during six years of honorable service in the U.S. Air Force.           My father served over twenty-five years as an Army officer.  While I’m truly thankful for the exposure to various cultures I acquired during my nomadic upbringing, the constant upheaval deprived me of strong roots or stability in any one region.  When Dad finally retired and stability seemed to be looming on the horizon, my parents divorced.  At age sixteen, I was withdrawn from public school in order to home school, work two jobs and help in the raising of my two younger brothers.  After re-enrolling into public schools, I never fully got into high gear.  Although I scored well on my ACT and received a college scholarship, I had no clear goals or ambitions, and I was a first-round knockout with an abysmal 0.11 GPA that freshman year.        Subsequently, I enlisted in the U.S. Air Force because I wanted time to develop more maturity and confidence.  I got what I wanted and more.  Six years in the military, including a rigorous year-long language course and deployment to the Middle East, has helped transform me into a serious, self-disciplined and mature student.             The path from my past attitude of aimless indifference to my present passion to excel in law school and beyond has included many challenges and victories.  I received recognition as honor graduate in my class at the Defense Foreign Language Institute; I attained the highest score in the class on the Hebrew Language Proficiency Test; I was named “distinguished graduate” at the U.S. Air Force NCO Airman Leadership School, and I’ve made steady progress toward completing a bachelor’s degree during off-duty time.            As end of my enlistment drew closer I began exploring new career paths.  It was during this transitional period that my brother Stuart and his wife began sharing their law school experiences with me.  They gave in-depth accounts of both law school and their responsibilities as practicing attorneys, and I was intrigued.  After extensive research, there was no doubt in my mind. My next destination would be law school.            These experiences around the globe have prepared me for excellence.    My path has been far from traditional, but I’ve benefited from many lessons learned and I know I will one day put them to good use as an attorney.  I am eager to excel in law school and to become an attorney well respected by my peers and my family.

20090221013944AAuqlwg	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Thinking about being a Physician's Assistant?	I'm thinking of becoming a PA after I graduate college with a BS in biology from a UC school, but was wondering how competitive PA Master Programs are (as in a GPA figure, test scores, other factors)? I checked online at some programs and they seemed to be vague on their statistics.      My school advised as much direct patient contact (more than just volunteering) and said that many PA's have previously worked as emergency medical technician, licensed vocational nurse, etc. however I am a full time student and after I graduate I am afraid I won't be able to compete with the professional experience of a nurse or EMT....      I plan on volunteering, performing research, and getting good grades if I stay on track, but was wondering do most PA programs accept graduates right out of college w/ a BA or BS?       Also, what is the pay like (i.e. is it worth all the schooling), but mostly, is the job rewarding and is it a stable one?     Thanks!
