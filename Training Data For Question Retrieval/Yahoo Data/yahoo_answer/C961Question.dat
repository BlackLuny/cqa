There were so many bad calls like that touchdown Santonio Holmes didn't get his feet in, the fact that Arizona got nailed with so many wrong penalties, and they didn't even review the last pass by Kurt Warner during the game and his arm was definitly moving forward. Also when Santonio Holmes did the LeBron Chalk that was a penelty to because using the ball as a prop is automatticly a 15-yard penalty.   That was such a disapointing game and my opinion of the NFL is extremely low.

Aguirre turned them into a midtable team to a CL capable team. Aguirre had to cope with the exit of their best striker Torres.

20090202164505AAQuaIw	Sports;Basketball	How's this three team trade?	 http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...       It might have to wait until Chris Kaman is back healthy, but according to the Clippers that shouldn't be too much longer.      It seems like all three teams win to me:      Minnesota: Loses Miller, who has been disappointing this season, and another unneeded player and gets a true point guard in return. This would allow Foye to move to the sg spot permanently and play to his best ability. Hinrich is a top notch pg whose presence will help every player on the floor.      Clippers: Solidify their starting pf and c instead of juggling three and risk making them unhappy. In return, they get a solid g/f swingman, just like they've been looking for, as well as a young and promising f/c to come off the bench and potentially be molded into a replacement for the aging Marcus Camby. Miller's contract also expires in 2010, so if he doesn't work out, then the Clippers can make a play in free agency.      Chicago: They lose the somewhat expendable Hinrich, clearing up some of the guard glut, and one of the young guys of their sometimes inconsistent front line, and gain exactly what they lack: a true center who can both block shots and anchor the defense, as well as score in the post. This trade allows them to let the younger guys come along and develop. They can then devote more playing time to Thabo Sefalosha and Tyrus Thomas and have them develop into solid contributors to the team.      It seems like a win-win-win trade to me, what do you think?

They are also guys who understand the game and the fighters. And who doesn't love Yves' in-fight acrobatics?      But Steve Mazzegatti is just horrible. He always lets guys take too many hits before he stops a fight. Kevin Mulhall is also not a great ref either, he made some bad calls during the Coleman/Shogun fight.

When D-Wade went down and was seen agonizing in pain, Kobe jocks started taunting him like little school girls about how he cried his way off the court.    When Paul Pierce got injured in the Finals and had to be carried off the court, they showed their unsportsmanship-like conduct by claiming he faked the injury?  Are you certified doctors to know exactly how he faked the injury?    Now that Bynum has gone down in wheel chair history and people start talking about it, y'all get pissed off and call everyone haters.  I wonder who are the biggest D-Wade, Paulie Pierce, and LeBrick or LeChoke haters on this forum?    MC claimed in one of my questions that "Andrew didn't cry or come back after 1 minute."    Well, here's a reality for you buddy.    "He (Bynum) could be heard screaming in pain on the court as it happened. He was sitting downcast with his chin on his hand as he was just moved with a wheeled stool being used to keep his right leg extended with an icepack on it."    How does it feel to be on the butt end of D-Wade jokes?  Karma is a &@$%& isn't it?

20090202173544AA3VxlQ	Sports;Boxing	A question for Heavyweight Boxing of now ,of yesterday and tomorrow~!?	ok i have said again my analysis about ancient Greek, then 18th and 19th British and the 20th century boxing, that Greeks, Brits and  American athletes made 99% of participation and champions,in their eras!( and i believe huge majority agreed with me,how can u disagree with facts and % right?)      now i have a question    the last about10 years that HW is dominated by Euros Lennox started and it is still dominated (even if Haye wins and dominates, last time i checked he is european as well)   so i ask now as a human who thinks:      in other times ( i disagree 100% with all this non sense ,but ok according to the majority of fans here) during jack dempsey or rocky marciano or larry holmes ,division got weak for a couple of years, but always after maybe 5-6 years of weakness, a great champion (according to americans always ) was coming to give a fresh air of breathe to division!   so what i ask is this simple thing    since we all young people in here and we have at least 35 or 45 years of life (i hope for all of us ) if the HW division gonna look EXACTLY as it looks now ,boxers from many  different countries ,becoming champions (every now and then americans as well ,but this 20th century domination nowhere near again)   so if that happens for the next 40 years (which i think is EXTREMELY POSSIBLE)    then which one is more valid???   a) the excuses of americans that lost interest in boxing now, that all world takes part in????(for my friends who say that olympic boxing aint matter to americans, I HAVE A VALID POINT,from 1952 till today that cubans and easterns, participate in olympic boxing ,americans have decline dramatically,BUT IN 1984 THAT CUBANS AND ALL EASTERN WORLD BOYCOTTED OLYMPICS, AMERICANS WON ALMOST EVERY MEDAL IN OLYMPIC BOXING ,THAT AINT VALID POINT MY FRIENDS??? LOL what i mean is,if they aint care for these  olympics, right?? WHY IN 1984 DID SO GREAT IN BOXING AGAIN??:) )   B)or my point of view (and many many many more people wordlwide)   that champions since the whole world take part in, WILL COME FROM MANY COUNTRIES AND AMERICANS WILL HAVE A CHAMP ,only when this CHAMP ,IS TRULY A WORLD CHAMP??   (means that he has to beat people from all the world,not boxers of just other states of  the usa l,ike the whole 20th century happened)   peace

My question is where should I start, the trails that I have in the immediate area range from hard packed singletrack to a sand hill with a big kicker, and sometimes it gets a bit tacky/muddy. What I am looking for is a tire pressure that is suited for these conditions, I know that they vary very much but try your best. Also I do like my tires softer than hard. A front and rear pressure would be nice.~~Thanks

I live about 2 miles from school; doesn't take too long to walk, but on days I don't have work, I'd like to get home a little faster and not burden my family with giving me rides. :P     Also, I'm going to be going to college this fall. Up in the mountains. It's a pretty small school, (NAU), so I've been told quite a few people ditch the cars and just bike around.    Is using a small percent of my savings on a new bike worth it? And if so, knowing my circumstances and age, what's a good one? I've been looking around...I'm not interested in the really professional bicycles, because I'm not looking to compete. Mostly just commute and ride around for fun; I miss having a bike. :(    So are the ones at like, Target any good? What brands are reliable, and what, knowing all this, should I look for? Mountain bike, cruiser...? I'm trying to do a lot of research before I buy because I haven't had a bike for like three years since we moved, and I'm too tall for it now haha. We gave it away.     So anyone who's really into bikes, could you give me advice on what to look for, where to go, and any other tips...as well as whether this is more worth it than a car. I like the exercise, so as long as I'll be safe crossing intersections and all, I don't mind. :)    Thanks!

20090202152738AAjA3Yz	Sports;Baseball	1941 season: Williams or Dimaggio?	During the 1941 season, you had two amazing players having great years. On one hand you had Ted Williams who hit .406 during the whole season, he was the first player to do it since Bill Terry hit .400 in 1930.      On the other hand you have Joe Dimaggio hitting in a record 56 straight games. Which outstanding.      Now both of these things haven't been done since, and the odds of being broken anytime soon are slim in my opinion.      Which one do you guys believe is more impressive? Please explain your answer.

Last year I was on the varsity team as the number 4 guy with two juniors and one other freshman in front of me.  Last year I would average around mid 90s for 18 holes.  This year I should be low 90s or high 80s.  By my senior year the local pro says I should be shooting in the 70s.        My question is what kind of scores will I need to play college golf. D1, D2, or D3.  And also how should I go about getting a golf scholarship?      Thanks in advance

20090202175336AAfm3zR	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	NASCAR TRIVIA! Do you know who this driver is?	Who am I?   One of my first cars in Cup was heated by a NATIVE AMERICAN stove. This replaced our earlier sponsor who kept us warm after drinking alot of. After the stove went out we went flying with a new sponsor...little did we know how far those wings would take us!   After Jaws left Junior I reunited with one of my earlier sponsors...they made me warm again. But the success just didn't come in this car.   I drove for the first car in racing....but this Olds was old and just wouldn't run. I didn't hang around and went to hang out in the Sun with the owner who gave me my big break. That break led to breakfast the next year. But the sponsor was stolen by a top CUP team...my owner was devastated when I went with the sponsor. I hung around for several years got a trophy or two....and settled down and drove my original car # again thanks to the King loaning it out. Now I am a journeyman in every sense of the word. All I have is my helmet and the desire to go racing. You gotta a car and need a driver??? Well, I am your man.....and if the stars align just right....I am guaranteed to get you in the field. Who am I?????      Good luck and have fun with it! Best answer goes to the person who answers the most clues.

20090202180330AAFusIl	Sports;Football (American)	How come no one is complaining about Fitz's illegal tackle at the end of the Harrinson INT?	All you haters want to cry and blame the refs.  Well that is the ultimate sign of a loser, when all you can do is point fingers and blame someone else.      On the Harrison return, Fitzgerald chases him down by running down the sidelines out of bounds.  He makes no effort to return to the field of play.  Why?  Because if he was on the field someone would block him.  If someone blocks him while out of bounds, that would be a Steeler penalty.  So Fitz leaves the field of play by his own volition.  That immediately makes him ineligible to return to the field and make the play.  If you run out of bounds you cannot re-enter the field and make a tackle.  Period.  It's the rule.  Yet, if the refs had ruled Harrison down on the one, the Steelers would have been screwed because the refs blew the call.  And if Fitz was forced out by a Steeler, the rule states that the player must make an attempt to re-enter the field of play.  Fitzgerald did no such thing.      Fitzgerald's tackle on Harrison was 100%, straight out of the rule book, illegal.  How come no one is crying about that?  Ya losers.

20090202181501AA9bUzg	Sports;Football (American)	Is it a waste of time to cheer for a losing team?	I'm a Cubs, Blackhawks, Dolphins and brifely a Cardinals fan and for 24 years I have seen nothing but absolute failure from my teams. None of them have made any effort to win the Championship. You can say that the Cubs made it to the playoffs 2 times in a row, the Blackhawks are in 4th place in the Western Confrence and the Cardinals got into the Superbowl, and the Dolphins went from 1-15 to Division Champs, but no true fan in the begining of the season say "I'll be happy if they made the playoffs"       My point is, when your team doesnt win the champiopnsip then you are a failure. You cant help but feel like a failure. There are no poistives in losing. Especially when your team hasnt won anything in over 50+ years.       So my question is, is it a waste of time cheering and rooting for teams that will never win anything. Will the NFC Championship be the best the Cardinals ever do? Will the Cubs forever be doomed to never win the World Series, will the Blackhawks ever hoist the Stanley Cup, will the Dolphins return to championship Glory? All signs point to No.       If your teams cant win, then why bother.

I was hanging out with a friend today and I mentioned that my girlfriend does jujitsu and says she is a black belt. He said I was crazy, dating a girl who could kick my a**. I said I didn’t think she could, I mean she’s 165 cm 55 kg maximum, and looks a little like Natalie Portman and I am 185 cm and weigh 79 kg and I play basketball. My friend just laughed and said that I wouldn’t stand a chance against a black belt, no matter sex or size. He says he’d be scared of her, cause she could knock him/me out with a single kick or throw him/me around like a ragdoll. I think he may have watched too many martial arts movies. So who is right, me or him?
20090202182842AAXE6pF	Sports;Fantasy Sports	Will the Ravens have a top five defense next year without Rex Ryan?	I think that they still should, because they'll most likely still have the core of RayLew and E Reed, as well as Rex Ryan's old D. They may not have "the Mad Scientist," but they'll still be able to achieve his "organized chaos", because they've been doing it for years. Also, even if they didn't use their usual confusing techniques, they certainly have the right personnel to be a good, straightforward D. They have some of the best players for each position, and these players are some of the most versatile because they were forced to move around with Ryan's D, but they still will do well ordinarily.

20090202184418AACYHDf	Sports;Tennis	Who else thought Roger was being a bit of a baby when he cried after the final?  Your thoughts?	My thoughts:      I felt a little sorry for him, but in all honesty I really thought he was being a bit of a baby.        I mean look dude (Roger), you spent 230+ weeks at the top, but did the guy who was #1 before you cry (Roddick, I think) when you took it from him?  No, he didn't.  You can't stay on top forever-somebody's eventually gonna knock you off.      Sure, you were a gracious winner during that time, but hey let's be honest, it's easy being a holy man on top of the mountain.      The reason I think he broke down and cried was because this final was definitive proof that he's not the best in the game now.  I'm sure he gave it his all during the match and yeah I'm sure it sucks really really hard having to acknowledge that you're no longer the best, but look dude (Roger), you're gonna go down as one of the best ever and you're probably still pass Pete's Slams record (although I think Rafa is going to pass his Slams record eventually).        The overwhelming majority of human beings throughout history have never been able to say they were the best in ANYTHING EVEN FOR ONE SECOND, and you (Roger) got to be on top of the world for longer than anyone in the tennis world has ever been.        So yeah I gotta be honest, it kinda pissed me off a little to see him break down and cry when most of us would give our right arms to have been gifted, motivated and fortunated enough to climb to where he was FOR JUST ONE SECOND OF OUR LIVES.  I'm sure Roger is truly grateful to have been up there for that long, but I wish he had remembered how incredibly blessed he has been to have been so gifted (and had the dedication AND the family/mentor support to hone those gifts, of course) at that moment on the award stand and commented on it instead of crying.       It also took away from Rafa's great victory even though he did the very gracious thing of consoling Roger, which in all honesty I thought was the most touching part of the whole thing.

It chrons at anywhere from about 385-406 FPS (.20g). And, me and my lust for power, (FPS wise), would like to know just how high I can crank it up to. I am prefering at least 550, but I have heard that some guns can get as high as 620-670 FPS. My gun has 7mm bushings, and I have heard that if you cross a certain FPS rate, you have to upgrade your bushings and trigger. My bushings are already full metal. Please also list all of the things that will need to be upgraded/changes/removed to meet that speed. Also, can my gun fire SEAMLESS HI QUALITY .12's? I have heard it is possible if they are seamless BB's. Please also include how much these upgrade(s) would cost. I also want a FULL COMPLETE list of all upgrades possible for my gun, and a link to where I can buy a full metal flash hider. I have heard rumors that there is an upgrade that can make your gun have the ability to fire metal BB's, and another that can make it a blowback somehow by connecting to the stock and being powered (the blowback thing) by c02. I want either A GOOD, WORTH WHILE, COMPLETE, FULL LIST THAT IS WORTH MY TIME, OR EITHER A LINK TO ONE. THANK YOU ALL WHO ANSWER (NOT CRACK JOB ANSWERS LIKE "GO BUY ANOTHER GUN", VERY VERY MUCH, AND MAY THE BEST ANSWER WIN.

Ok, I'm doing a solo at a competition coming up and I just got over an injury so I'm only doing handsprings for this one. One of my passes I can do anything I want, so I was thinking either :   1.) roundoff backhandspring, back handspring step out, backhandspring   OR   2.) roundoff backhandspring step out, backhandspring, backhandspring step out.      Trust me, my handsprings are dang close to perfect so it's just judged on which pass is worth more points.      Thanks!

20090202191621AADN5lT	Sports;Football (American)	Legendary player without ring or average player at best with ring? ?	If you were building a time unbound by time, and you had a choice to draft a legendary and hall of fame player without a ring or a less than average player with a ring, who would you draft. Somebody from my job who is very knowledgeable about sports and other things surprised me when he said that he would rather have Trent Dilfer (QB of Baltimore Ravens 2000 championship team) than Dan Marino. I understood what he was trying to say about having a player that could when than a superstar that doesn't. Trust me, I know. However, I would pick Dan Marino over Trent Dilfer anyday. He also said he would rather have Luc Longely (chicago Bulls center 90's) over Patrick Ewing. I just shook my head.      Would you pick Trent Dilfer or Dan Marino (type players).

20090202192605AAJXMnG	Sports;Basketball	Should the Big Ten be excluded from the tournament?	It seems every year, the Big Ten teams in the tournament gets embarrassed. I don't see any team from that conference making a serious run. I would say Michigan State, but they lost two straight games at home to Northwestern and Penn State. Earlier this season, Michigan beat UCLA and Duke. But that now seems like a distant memory. A win over UConn may improve their chances. I think the Big Ten is overrated.

Do you think he'll go hot & torch the Raps for 60+ again? He has the potential to if he wants. What are your predictions?
