1c51c666dd27141c05c4984bf5873864aa	sometimes you barely notice them at all unless you put your hand on your tummy and feel it sooooo tight. other times (especially later) it feels *almost* like the real thing. but the majority of mine (2 pregnancies) were on that barely noticeable level. yeah, annoying!|`|0H9UI7j7aa	Mine were annoying too but that's all  part of it. They seem to come when least expected.|`|1SdgCkQ1aa	Different people have different experiences.  I've heard some people don't even notice them, which amazes me - mine are soooooo obvious.|`|9d105810454e7efc3b50dfeaee12e780aa	Hello....First off Congrat's on the pregnancy. 2nd oh my how I remember them.  My baby is only 10months old so the feeling is still very fresh in my memory.  Braxton Hicks is so annoying, I went into the ER twice thinking I was in labor.  Other women told me that I would know when I was having an actual contraction, well never giving birth before these Braxton Hicks make you feel that way.  Mine were pretty extreme, my belly would tighten up very very tight and it would be mild pain. (Now that I really know how a contraction feels...LOL).  Yes they are extremley annoying.....Just let me tell you that if you are a first time mother these Braxton Hicks are a walk in the park and you will wish for the few hours you are in labor that you had them back.  I would never trade that experience for anything in the world.  Now that it is over...heheh....Good Luck and congrats... :)|`|t8ZL4F6Xaa	I never noticed if I had them a lot of things feel strange the first time you are pregnant. I wouldn't worry as long as there is no blood or you are not having continuous pain every so many minutes . Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy|`|7ea6a1cb51e2e14ceabf2266a913c593aa	Braxton Hicks can be very noticable or hardly noticable at all.  Place your hands on your lower abdomen and cradle the expanded outline of your uterine area when you experience the "strange feeling" and if you can feel your uterine muscles getting firm, as in tightening up,  and then relax and soften after the feeling passes, most likely you are experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions.  You will be an old hand at this with any future pregnancies you may have.  Congtratulations!|`|yDN511Nnaa	I am 6 months pregnant and at my last appointment I asked my doctor about my stomach getting rock hard for a few seconds and then it goes away... it happens A LOT... the doctor said that I was experiancing contractions but that it is normal and is preparing you for birth.  Mine are very noticable... I will feel a hardness in my stomach and then when I touch my stomach it is ROCK HARD but it goes away after about 10 seconds give or take.... if you have any pain with your contractions then I'd contact the doctor asap.|`|AA10552909	They can be strong enough that you think you're in labor.  But it takes an experienced medical person to tell the difference, so if you have really strong ones, get yer buns to the maternity hospital...especially if they're accompanied by a sudden gush of water and low back pain!
QzQYpcn4aa	Could be a muscle thing or possibly late onset of sciatica.  What I would do is call back and either talk to the on call nurse or the on call Dr. there is always one on afterhours.  They may suggest for you to go to an urgent care, or have you come in first thing in the morning.  Sometimes(i know mine does) your insurance company has a triage nurse and that might be helpful.  But, I would definately call the Dr office back and let it roll to the answering service and go from there.   good luck.<br>  contact me if you wish|`|d8905a02907003c093614ad45be2ad92aa	This may be just soreness from being "bumped" into by your fiance, or it could be round ligament pains..or it could be neither of these.  <br>  <br>  Your best bet would be to PAGE your doctor and have him/her call you back.  Is there anyone else in the practice?  PAGE the other doctors in the practice and have them call you back.<br>  <br>  OB/GYNS are on-call and will have others cover them when they cannot be on-call.  <br>  <br>  Where are you located exactly?  <br>  <br>  Also, when you call your doctor's office, what does hte outgoing message say for urgent calls?|`|dEd14ZaMaa	If you cannot get ahold of your doc go to the ER they are trained professionals we are not please see immediatly help and btw Im praying he "ran" into your belly on accident???|`|ac1c8ff7b3608fd9077f787115a00227aa	If you cannot get ahold of your OB call the hospitals Labor and Delivery. They will tell you exactly what to do.|`|AvV2IZrzaa	GO TO THE  E R  NOW PLEASE. ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN TO YOUR CHILD. YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE THE RISK. IF YOU ARE IN PAIN GO NOW.

f52ffd1bba1d2cc7a775e1c8410b9c70aa	For over a year I was still sore where I 'tore'. Even to this day, 3 1/2 years later I can still be a little sore. It takes time for the muscles and nerves to heal down there. I am sorry that you still hurt, it does get better.|`|RJKoggYdaa	I've heard of that happening, and I think its pretty much normal, but sometimes, there is a treatable cause for the problem.  My sister in law actually had that and doc gave her some for of medication that helped the pain go away completely.  consult your doctor if it doesn't go away soon.|`|FgJFYmLiaa	Thats normal...i had my daughter almost 18 months ago and i still hurt and i can feel where they cut me and it just hurts to put presure their.It takes time.|`|Tpj5tYuWaa	It takes time for your body to heal, just take it slow.  I just gave birth 6 weeks ago, and still have a stitch that will not dissolve causing me pain, I feel for you!
NbNG4F2eaa	I have had a cold for about a week now and my doctor said Robitussin DM is safe. Problem is since I can't take anything else, I don't seem to be getting better. :(|`|3ay0KVVDaa	Just call and ask your dr or the nurse on call if you can take it. I think it is safe|`|AA11017606	yes it is safe, try to get the stuff without alchohol in it, it is safer.|`|0VYcSpz3aa	ABSOLUTELY NOT!!...If you are pregnant don't take the advice of these people on this website..go ask your doctor first hand.|`|31b2e0be9602463765e8be412e53000faa	I had bronchitis about 2 weeks ago.  (I am currently 38 weeks).  Both my physician and OB told me that I could take PLAIN Robitussin (no extra ingredients, just the cough syrup)to help with the coughing.  I only took the minimum dose, and I ONLY took it before bed, and suffered through the rest of the day.  It definitely helped me sleep and get better.  I would recommend getting the advice of your own doctor, but as long as it is the plain robitussin, you should be fine.|`|XixUEF3naa	yes robitussin DM|`|cnOC1NUIaa	yes but dont chug the bottle|`|pHctCILlaa	yes. Robitusson DM. Thats actually what my doctor told me to take when I was pregnant. I was told robitusson dm, tylenol, tums, iron, and prenatal vitamins; i think thats all i could take without consulting dr first. I would let ur dr know about it though.|`|rb4CDysIaa	I work at an ObGyn office, we do not out pregnant patients take anything but Tylenol and if they are really bad, sudafed.....<br>  We do suggest a humidifier (cool mist)
73zWUWQhaa	i would say low risk.  but you could take a test now to put your mind at rest, and sort out birth control before you try again.|`|cnMXJMFUaa	Well Pre-ejaculate does contain sperm...its 50/50|`|vRvXvnRZaa	50/50 chance|`|AA10961241	It's hard to tell. Everyone is different. My sister got pregnant her first time and I've been married for almost two years and still haven't gotten pregnant. You'll just have to wait it out. Try buying a pregnanct test if you're really concerned.|`|iIYMOriSaa	depends this might be embarissing to ask ur bf but ask him if sperm came out of his dick when we went in<br>  <br>  a man can feel when sperm comes out of his dick<br>  <br>  also its more possible your not pregnet because he onley went in twice
DvWGTzLUaa	In the UK the only person you'll see (providing you're low risk) is your midwife. If your higher risk you may have to see an obstetrician. I'm 40+6 and have not had an internal yet. Thats more of an American thing I believe. A couple of days ago my midwife did ask me, "do you want me to have a wee feel down below?" I refused because I didnt want a sweep and I dont need to know if I'm dilated or effaced, cuz it means nothing. You can go from nothing to fully dilated in a matter of hours, or it could take weeks. My midwife didnt seem bothered though. If your worried about having an internal your completely within your rights to refuse one, and for that matter your completely within your rights to refuse any medical procedure. Hope that helped.|`|F7HBPnD8aa	i am just over 38 weeks and haven't had one i know that if your baby is late they may try and help things along by inserting a finger and rubbing it around the babies head and your cervix. but i don't think they will give you one unless you have any health issues
U5tFFkRwaa	Sometimes I can go through a whole day at work without having a chance to change.  I'm sure the diaper weighs about two pounds by the time I get home!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	this morning it was wet from the top of the diaper all the way to the back and was filled with poop|`|8Qbx8PDnaa	same here but except now im getting tired of waking so much to change 3 times a night so i think im going to buy him huggies overnnights see if they work|`|bgNB9RzNaa	lol about a pound it suprised me how much could come out of such a little baby|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	LOL, middle of the night last night..Sarah has been sick and not having a lot of wet/dirty diapers, I have been giving her pedilyte and water left and right.( she was vomiting ) FINALLY last night it was like the dam was opened...along with some other stuff. oh man..this may sound strange, but I was never happier about her pee pee and poopy diaper. It had to weigh close to 2 lbs..(not really) But thank god she finally had more then a tablespoon of pee in her diaper, I was worried. Now the poo can umm stop now UGH|`|SKJb6eLKaa	It was Anton's diaper last night and my oh my, it was atleast 1-2lbs! I didn't think his diapers would be so heavy until atleast 8 wks (he's only 4 wks)|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Every morning my daughter goes poopy. Since eating solids she only goes poopy once a day, but boy is it huge!!!! It has to weigh over a pound. If I don't get to it RIGHT away it starts to come out the side and its pretty much all over :/  The beauty in being a mom... :)|`|u9sGH0AXaa	Yesterday!  I think its the way the diaper absorbed,  It was the first time I used this brand.  I'm not buying it any more!|`|uuKTQ84Qaa	My son finally slept through the night  last night kind of and  the diaper was like there was a brick in or something  i do hope this   will be done by the time i start   potty training him !

But the middle name is used A LOT!    Hope you find something that works. I don't really like Gabriella Leigh that much =/|`|D0pQFlMIaa	It is beautiful. The only thing is the two "la" "Le" sounds that kinda run together. But I don't think it is too big a deal. I'd say go for it if you love it.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	How about:  Gwyneira (it means white snow in Welsh)  Cordelia  Delilah  Skye  Alyssa  Erina
ggfE4rlvaa	Birth control is meant to trick your body into thinking it's pregnant. Having a dark red gooey period though, I'd say it was either a funky period or possibly a miscarriage if you were pregnant. If it's your first time on the shot, you gotta let your body get used to it, it'll start doing funny things. As far as the pregnancy, I think it would have been way to early to feel a decent movement, and it most certainly wouldn't be up to your belly button yet. Or pouch rather, lol. You would be feeling it constantly as well, once you feel movements, they only get stronger and stronger until eventually they kick hard enough to make you feel like your ribs are being kicked so hard they're cracking! It could have been gas or maybe diarrhea ;/ If it was baby movement though, you'd definitely be sure of it by now. Or would have a positive test. Go to the doctor and be totally honest, and see what they can do. Best of luck to you!|`|be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	We have no way of knowing what is happening inside of your uterus. The only thing you can do is go to the doctor.|`|547Ln6rNaa	I think if you had periods, it's unlikely that you are pregnant. Most people do not have a period when they are pregnant, though it isn't unheard of, it's pretty unusual.  As far as the tests go, you took those to early if you had sex end of October and tested beginning of November. But feeling something move in December would have been to early if you were pregnant, you'd have been 8-10 weeks and no one feels a baby moving at that early stage.    I would say that since you had a heavy period in January, it's unlikely that you are pregnant, but the sure way to find out is to go to the dollar store and get a test.|`|619339758ecfb9e1841f71251dea319daa	Make an appointment with a gyn doctor ASAP. I'm sure he/she will order blood tests, urine tests, and possibly a sonogram. They will ask for a medical history, so write down all the information and bring it with you. They are the doctor and know what to do, don't diagnose yourself. Good luck to you.|`|CptGRMSlaa	It is obvious you are worried.  You seem to be under a lot of stress.  Unfortunately, Stress causes anxiety, and anxiety can cause head aches, stomach problems, dizziness, etc.  Relax, sometimes, gas moving through the system does feel as you described. It seems like you could be having side effects to the shot too.  You must be proactive and go see your doctor.  Describe everything you have told us here.  Go buy a home pregnancy test and take it.  This will put your mind at ease for the weekend, but even if it is negative, you need to go to the doctors and get help because what you are experiencing requires an expert's opinion.|`|e4ec8a26064d1b408b4d493f2b6d5d8baa	Make an appointment with your Ob/GYN and they should be able to tell with an exam.|`|qZuPyBw1aa	well by now you should be able to take a pregnancy test and it will be more accurate, but still remember there is always false positives and negatives. i say go to your doctor just to be sure and give him a pee sample or blood test.   Also, when women suspect that they could be pregnant, and they aren't, it affects their period/hunger/mood swings etc. basically all the same symptoms your having now, and the feeling in your stomach is too early to be kicking from the baby, so it must have been just gas. But these symptoms could definitely be just because your stressing out. i would still say go to the doctor just to be sure|`|tFXmPL6Kaa	Im not trying to be mean.............but you should have went to an OBGYN months ago and explained in detail like you did now what is going on.  Sometimes you have to demand treatment if you arent getting your results. You should have asked for them to run lab work and an US....... So call on Monday and get in there and let them perform an US and see whats going on. Ok!|`|iwYu32N2aa	No one on here can answer that question. The only one that can is you, and you do that by buying a hpt or getting a blood test done. Sorry can't help you with these kind of questions
l4mMBe5Aaa	We used air-drying clay - it was super easy, a lot neater than plaster, and we could re-do the handprint until we got it just right (just roll it up and start over if you're not happy with the first one!)    *I mounted our daughter's handprint in a shadow box, along with a picture, kind of like this: http://www.babygiftstation.com/PhotoGall...|`|P16Vu20Haa	They do sell molding kits at craft stores, but it's hard to get baby to sit still when they're that age.. My baby is 7 months old, and I tried to do her handprint, and ended up wasting the kit that I bought! lol  I bought this kit on ebay, where it's an actual 3d casting kit.     http://www.castingkeepsakes.com|`|FYvCR8mvaa	Michael's has exactly what you need.  They have plaster molds, 3D molds and a cute silver frame where you put a picture on one side and a place for hand prints on the other.  I think that one is made by Sculpy.  They are all non-toxic and made especially for babies.  Please don't use regular plaster of paris because it is caustic and will burn baby's delicate skin.  have fun.
DgXmTJzYaa	nope. You got preggo on your own!
j2mRop0laa	It's such a hot topic because having a litter of kids is unnatural, in the first place.    I mean, in order for me to ever go through with something like that in first place I would have to have an 8 bedroom home (2 kids per room and 1 for myself), a touch of psychotics, and a housekeeping/ babysitting staff.     The woman is off her rocker.|`|prqrQcd1aa	who here is tired of hearing about it??    I say if they are being taken advantage of it is their own fault at this point, the woman is an adult and the parents do not need to do this...|`|nYnlYAE1aa	I agree with you 100%.  This whole situation saddens me.|`|XRLbqtUbaa	After 6 kids, she shouldn't have been able to have any more and she better hope social services doesn't see her as an unfit parent and remove all kids from the home...    I've said this before...this chick has mental issues!!|`|iyL6dyMyaa	The woman is stupid, and she needs to get her a job for a year, a cheap one so she can get daycare assistance, and even that won't help with 14 kids!!!  Then she would qualify for a Habitat for Humanity house.  But she has to put in the man hours of building that house.  She better appeal to Extreme Home Makeover, so she can get a bigger house.  She does have a screw loose somewhere.  She already had 6 kids in a 3 bedroom home, and then had the nerve to get 8 implanted in her, what the hell was she thinking?|`|VuUz8NgKaa	From my understanding the woman is single and has no plans on getting married, fine by my but with all of those kids, how will she take care of them all?|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	I HAVEN'T BEEN FOLLOWING THIS, BUT WHERE IS THE FATHER TO THESE KIDS?    poor grandparents|`|3WWHWsHOaa	I am wondering how they are going to manage with 17 people in a 3 bedroom home. These poor grandparents are being taken advantage of. But they don't seem to mind.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	the whole thing is crazy. they said on cnn this morning, she duped the fertility doctor, i guess. he stated that if he knew of the unstable conditions, her living with her parents still and no spouse, he would have never helped. he would have made her go somehwere else. he also didn't know of the other 6 children of hers already.  i don't understand it at all. she needs phsychiatric help. how does she plan to live when her parents are gone? if i was her parents, i would continually be checking for ways to get her out on her own. but then again, how???|`|AtTxzYXbaa	It's crazy.    I wonder if she did it to get attention. 6 kids and then octuplets...that will get people talking.    And it did!
dLqqIQ1uaa	because alot of women want to experience the joy of the actual pregnancy..but when it comes to acutally having the baby and caring for it then its a whole different story...like that chick who just had the octuplets..she was so obsessed with having babies since she was a teenager and doctors and pyschologists believe that she just enjoys being pregnant more than she enjoys being a mother. It's common among alot of women..the joy of being pregnant and having a life grow inside of you is so much more appealing than actually caring for the baby..|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I agree with Red.  There are some women out there who just love to be the center of attention....and what better way to get that than by being pregnant and having a baby.  Think about it...when you're pregnant, strangers will ask you when you're due, what you;re having, etc.  After the baby comes, people will oooh and ahhh over how cute your little one is.  It's sad, but I think there are lots of women who get pregnant for selfish reasons.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I had no idea how much work having a baby entailed. I'm 30, and I have an 8 month old.  The first months were easy for me, but the last month and a half have been a nightmare.  Now I'm not trying to rush him into growing, or being independent but I am tired.    I am also diabetic, and when I don't get enough sleep I feel sluggish for hours after waking.    I love my son with all my heart...and I get up with him whenever he needs me to.  But telling my husband that I am tired and need a break is not going to make me a bad mother.|`|UtXjDzjKaa	exactly, i dont know though|`|xBd96wvRaa	It all boils down to expectations of parenthood.|`|723QHuicaa	sorry, Ive missed the point of this question...    Do you want a medal? Cause you arent going to get one.    Be happy in the knowledge you love and care for your kids and be less concerned with other people.|`|AA11503678	It is because of ignorance. The biggest effort needed to foster a child correctly. Love, patience, sacrifice, wisdom, maturity, indastriousness , feeding, housing, caring for years day after day needed. Only a mature woman can do these.|`|qGQCLFinaa	I have no clue!! I'm with you! I don't complain, as he didn't ask to come into this world & i love feeling like i'm a good mother & i'm taking good care of my son, especially when i see other mothers who aren't exactly good parents, it is frustrating to me how people can be so careless when it comes to sex & everyone wants to have sex, but they don't always want to deal with the consequences for having sex!  Frustrating yes! but i'm just thankful my son has me for mom!!|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	I believe everybody needs some time to vent, and everybody does every so often (even 'perfect' mothers, I am sure).  It doesn't make you less of a mother to your child(ren)...it makes you human.  And when mothers "complain" when they don't sleep long enough, perhaps they are "worried" that they do not sleep enough.  Sometimes worries come out phrased as complaints.    I think that if they are complaining every moment of every day, then they need a serious attitude adjustment.  However, if they complain only once in a while, I think it is completely normal and does not make them a bad mother, or a mother who wants little autonomous robots.  Again, it makes them human, and very normal.|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	I was a mother at 19 and I did very well not my own as a single mother. I was still living with my mom at the time but I took care of my son on my own. My mom would suggest things or tell me to put him down or put him to bed instead of rocking him. But I did it my way, I knew what he was doing. My son is a great kid and my mom tells me I'm a good mom. I just wish she would backed off at first. Me and my son have a great bond together too.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I agree, everyone needs to vent, though I'll agree when I was in my 20's my friends would push me to have kids and then complain about theirs non stop, which really made me question whether I wanted any. Yes, some people are unrealistic when they want a newborn to sleep through the night, but that doesn't mean they do not love their kids. I am sure I have complained of being tired at times but my son and his daddy are the love of my life. One of my best friends boo-hoos about motherhood all the time but she adores her kids-she just likes to vent!|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Some women don't know how to be a good, nurturing mother, because this behavior wasn't displayed to them.  Some women are just plain lazy, and that's where neglect falls into play.  Some women are still just about themselves.  I know people like that, and then they keep having kids.  So what's seriously wrong with them, I don't know.  I had a son because I wanted a child.  For a long time I would have cats and they were my kids, but once I got rid of my cats, I was ready to be a mother.  They usually say how you treat your pets, would determine how you would treat your kids.  Usually when they look at serial killers or sociopaths, who start off abusing animals, then move onto people.  So all I can say is ignorance and a lack or respect for themselves, and living in the moment is the reason why women have babies and then complain, IF they do it all the time.  Occasional is normal, but consistently complaining is a problem.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Well you are 1 in a million...    I have never came across a mother who doesn't get tired or complain.     I never planned on having a baby but I did get pregnant and my daughter is now 9 months old. I love her more than anything and wouldn't change my life for the world. However,  I have been tired, I have complained and I have been frustrated because being a Mom is HARD WORK. No one knows until they experience it and I believe it is only human to feel these emotions.     Just because a Mom is tired or a Mom needs help doesn't mean they shouldn't want or have babies...|`|6fiYhtACaa	Because too many believe that a baby is the latest accessory (thank you Britney, Ashley, Brangelina) akin to the latest, most stylish purse. Much too late, they realize that a baby is a tremendous responsibilty and a lifetime commitment unlike that purse that can be shelved in the closet or hawked on e-bay. Babies also gradually turn into adults and are no longer the attention getters that they were as infants. Finally, much to these women's chagrin, they realize that babies actually work as man repellant and at that point try to expedite the baby's independence and diminish and marginalize their needs. Doesn't work. Especially when you lack the funds to finance an army of nannies, cooks and maids like the A-list celebrities who make having a baby a must-have item of the season.|`|qMhLcn8Gaa	Because to some women, having a child is just feeding it, and lots of "OHMYGOD He's so cute!" from their friends. They don't honestly consider what it actually takes to raise a child.|`|waU776uwaa	I have a 9 months old who I did not plan for. And although I knew that having a baby would be hard work, nothing prepared me for the reality that I had to face. My son is the apple of my eye and there is nothing in this world that I would not do for him.    Yes I get tired And yes I wish he would sleep through the night, but if he doesn't, I will wake up and nurture him back to sleep like a mother should. You should accept that people are just that, people. And no matter how much we love our babies it sometimes help to vent. And hats off to you if you do it with a smile 24/7 365 days!|`|b0NCSShfaa	i guess they thought it was going to be easy   but when they realized it isnt   they complain
VGij9p0Taa	Congrats!   I love the fact that your honouring family members that's really sweet i love the name Rose and Dean so its really great!   Out of the girls names my favourites;-   Gabrielle Rose  adorable i have a cousin called Gabriella Rose which i think is pretty but this is just as beautiful nickname Elle not Gabby please! Carys Rose, Carys meaning grace is really pretty this name provides a good mix of old and new. Callie Rose this is so sweet beautifully sweet so cute.   My favourite out the boys:-   Alexander Dean, Alexander is such a good strong name that flows really well with Dean. Jackson Dean, i love the name Jackson meaning son of Jack and it goes superbly well with Dean. Jacob Dean also sounds really great.   If i was you i would go with for a girl Gabrielle Rose and for a boy Jackson Dean!   Hope i helped in some way....|`|7drjpohUaa	My friend's name is Emily Rose, and ever since the movie, she's hated it. And she refuses to see it.      Gabrielle Rose. Love it! It's very classic and beautiful.  Carys Rose. I don't really understand the name Carys. Maybe Carrie?  Lara Rose. I don't like Lara, but I like Cara.  Alice Rose. Alice is such a sweet name that you don't see that often. I love it!  Dahlia Rose. I don't really like the name Dahlia, sorry.  Lyra Rose. It's unique and cute, I like it.  Morgan Rose. I LOVE the name Morgan. It's so adorable and spunky.  Callie Rose. Callie is such a cute name also. I love the "ie" at the end of names.     Alexander Dean. I think it's too old-fashioned.  Jackson Dean. I don't really like the name Jackson ever since Hannah Montana.  Jacob Dean. Very strong name, I like it.  Oliver Dean. Oliver is another name you don't see too often. I like it!  Connor Dean These two names work very well together.      My suggestions:  Josephine Rose.  Jocelyn Rose.  Evelyn Rose. (instead of Emily Rose?)  Millie Rose.  Rosemary Josephine? I know you said the Rose is staying, but using it as a first name works well.  Skylar Rose.    Aidan Dean.  Joseph Dean.  Noah Dean.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	Callie Rose! my name is Callie Marie. but Callie Rose is beautiful(:  i also like Gabrielle and Lara.    Alexander Dean is my favorite|`|tg89r7ZJaa	Girl- Dahlia Rose or Callie Rose  Boy- Jacob Dean or Alexander Dean|`|JurCyY2Gaa	my name is Callie Ann, but Rose sounds awesome!!!|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	I love Emily Rose and Alice Rose  I love Jacob Dean and Alexander Dean [alex for short]|`|UzkHnXzVaa	Alice Rose, and wow, I actually like all of the boys names.

Rose is almost cliched in the middle name form, but I do agree that it's pretty.    I love Lyra Rose, but I think Dahlia Rose is overkill in the flower department.|`|djuRlggeaa	Girls-  Gabrielle Rose  Dahlia Rose  Callie Rose (I also like Callie Marie... from the first answerer)    Boys-  Connor Dean  Jacob Dean    Suggestions for Girl names-  Crystal Rose  Julia Rose  Savannah Rose  Isabella (Bella) Rose|`|S4QBvAaGaa	I like Oliver Dean and Morgan Rose or Gabrielle Rose.

There is nothing wrong with the other names on your list, they are all fine, just not to my taste.    From the boys names my favourites would be Oliver Dean and Connor Dean.   I also like Alexander Dean and Jacob Dean.  I'm not a huge fan of Jackson being used as a first name cos, to me, it's a surname....just my opinion though!    Good luck!|`|BGIsuNMTaa	I like Gabrielle Rose, Emily Rose, Alice Rose and Morgan Rose, I really cant stand Lara, sorry just my opinion but it reminds me too much of lara croft.

7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	That's funny. I'll tell you why. My momma whooped my sister for talking back to her and she was 19 and married. It got her attention too. It worked. HA HA|`|flqAr30laa	Well, stop messing up and you won't get a whooping.|`|prqrQcd1aa	What are you doing that is warrenting a whooping? maybe tell them that you don't like being hit and there are other ways of punishing you when you screw up, like taking things away and grounding you...|`|94da8fe67f0c5641825912cfda8d23a9aa	why do you think that you are....apparently you aren't to big for the behavior that leads to the spanking so you aren't to big to be spanked either|`|547Ln6rNaa	I don't think you will convince her if that's how she feels about things, clearly you haven't been able to talk your problems and disagreements through so far, since she is still smacking you, not talking it out....    This made me laugh "My momma whooped my sister for talking back to her and she was 19 and married." - I read it out to my husband and he laughed to and said "Damn straight!" - however, we don't actually smack our own child. We approve in principal but do not practice it at home.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	ya...that's just wierd.  Do some research online and print out what you find-of course if it's in your favor!  In my mind, spanking is NEVER right and should NEVER be done.  Just google it and see what comes up.  Maybe if she realized how stupid I'm sure she looks and sounds when she's doing it, talking about it or even thinking about it, she'll reconsider.  And, honestly, I would struggle back and not LET her do it---you are big enough to fight back!|`|vLFUtWuoaa	If you don't wont to get spanked like child then don't act like one. Show your mother you can be responsible. Do your work without being asked. Do the stuff you know she wants you to do before she asked you too.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	My mom didn't stop giving me spankings until I was 14. I agree with the first commenter though, stop messing up and you won't get spanked.|`|kBn4UaMUaa	Stop acting childish and doing wrong and maybe just maybe you will not get a spanking|`|cPMHKz4Oaa	You are too old to be spanked,  Taking away privileges sometime hurt worse than being spanked.  But a parent has to stick to their guns on that.  I've seen parents (myself included)  who if it interfered with what they wanted to do would go back on that and it didn't do any good.  Getting older has made me wiser on that end .  I think spankings should be used only as a last resort.|`|AKKWDcqnaa	this makes me mad! i dont know what type of spanking you mean but any tye of hitting is WRONG. when i was little, my parents would hit me with literally anything they could get their hands on. you know how its a saturday morning and ur watching tv n ur mum/dad goes "go clean ur room" n ur like "wait im watching something"? well that was the biggest mistake of my life. actually the biggest mistake was putting up with it but that was one of the biggest. i got hit so much and so hard that i broke my wrist and had bruises all over. I was sent to a foster home and now i live with a great foster family and i am happy and free at last. I havent kept in touch with my parents either.    so really it depend what type of hitting it is. if it gets out of control then speak to someone at your school. no-one should have to go through what i went through and i just wish i hadn't put up with it for so long.    If it's litterally just a little tap but you don't like it then try talking to your parents and say that you would much rather them taking away your "privileges" than hitting you.
HQb7KK7kaa	hi there    it sounds like a early miscarriage to me  since you are bleeding and having cramps and then a neg pregnancy test,  try and get some rest and take some pain killers,  i am so sorry for your loss and take your time to grieve      i had one 2 weeks ago  i was about 4 weeks and 5 days pregnant,  i found out on the 16th jan i was pregnant and then i started bleeding on the 21st jan,  really heavy and bad cramps,  i went to the doctor and they thought it was a miscarriage and told me to take a test in a weeks time so i did a test this monday and it was neg,so we are trying again now    i wish you all the luck,  add me as a friend so we can keep in contact if you want|`|tFXmPL6Kaa	only thing i have to tell you is "go to the ER" Go to one of those carenow or 1st emergency room clinics then make an appt to go see an OBGYN on Monday morning.  Sorry...|`|AA11052660	Please don't panic or worry.  Don't cry any more It is unpleasant but miscarriages are very normal. If you are having a miscarriage, its either because the foetus was unviable, or because the foetus didn't attach to your womb properly.    Sorry about the pain but don't suffer it, Phone your hospital get some pain relief and help with things.    EDIT: Sorry FACE is also correct.  Phone 999 / 911 now and explain symptoms.  Could be ectopic - that is seriously life threatening. Do not hesitate.|`|8c4kRTnPaa	it could be an ectopic pregnancy if you are hurting on one side or an early miscarriage. Try not to stress, take Tylenol or ibuprofen for the pain and cramping. Call your doctor and get lots of rest. You could try calling a friend and talking to them about it. Hope you feel better.|`|aEgYElA8aa	Ive been going through the same thing, i think they call it a chemical pregnancy. Last sun it began as brown tinted discharge then gradually got heavier and ALOT more painful tues,wed and thurs, the cramps have gone and just spotting a little now. I know its a horrible thing to go through,i got really upset in the week. Ive been reading lots of posts on here saying you are your most fertile after miscarriage and that's whats keeping me going, it simply wasn't meant to be just yet. So im going to try again this month. With lots of love from your hubby and family you will be okay. If you get unbearable pain on one side make sure u get to a+e incase it turns out to be ectopic. I wish you all the luck and love in the world.xxx|`|2bk7RL0Kaa	Sorry to say but you have had a miscarriage, not much you can do now,try to rest and take some pain killers if needed,my wife lost ours last year at 13 weeks.. so sorry|`|JDw1RDcaaa	I'm sorry but I would say it was a miscarriage but ring your midwife or local hospital because they can give you the best advise.    But i was having a period for the first three months of my pregnancy so i didnt know i was pregnant so it can happen but please get checked out    Good Luck and i hope all goes well.|`|yDNv30Okaa	i lost my baby at what would have been my 5th week of preg. it started off with light brown spotting, with no pain, disappered for a day, came back heavier, and eventually turned into heavy like period bleeding, but brighter red, also by this time with a lot of pain.  so this does sound like a m/c, im so sorry, it may be a chemical pregnancy which is what i had, where you get all the signs of being preg, but for some reason the embryo doesnt attach to the uterus wall, you do however still feel pregnant for a few days, or weeks, and will get a positive on a test, then when you start to bleed, the test will be negative, its estimated that almost 50% of pregnancies will end in this way, tho most will not know they were pregnant, and just think they have a late, heavier period|`|fh6TgqENaa	Yes you are more than likely having a miscarriage. I had one at 8 weeks for my 2nd pregnancy and the bleeding was alot. I don't however remember all of the pain? I would go and get checked for ectopic pregnancy. Call you doctor right away.|`|aJoSjPFzaa	FIRST OF ALL, listen to me...    if you were definitely pregnant, but are now bleeding with pain on one side, get to the hospital asap. this could be an ectopic pregnancy. this is a very serious condition where the embryo grows in your Fallopian tube instead of the uterus. it is that serious that it can endanger your life if it is not treated. please get it checked out!!!!!!

rIDZZZnbaa	If u just want 2 be his friend, then stay that way. But it seem like u want to be more then a friend, if u want to no if he has a girl friend. If u want to be more then a friend, then just ask him|`|98PLi1Rbaa	Just say that do you have a girlfriend and say im not trying 2 hook up with you im just asking|`|s4M7tJU5aa	bring the topic of the conversations onto "friends" and "people you know" then ask casually "so are you in a relationship with anyone"    it throws people off the scent if you do it this way|`|TIFhe21laa	if you  make a big deal out of it he may get suspicious so you're better off leaving it as a casual question. if you ask him casually, maybe even a little teasing since you're freidns, i don't think itll be awkward for either of you.|`|4nleceOEaa	if you just wanna be friends then why do you care,really?  lol  anyhow...i think you should just sound real casual about it  and be like  "hey ...just wondering.you have a girlfriend?"  if he asks why then just say.."like i said..im just curious"  thats it  lol  -good luck and best wishes|`|TYQOafA8aa	Then ask him stating that you just want to be his friend.|`|QoS8ChCnaa	You don't just have to come out and be like "Hey! I was wondering do you have a girlfriend??" Just sometime when  you guys are talking or something just be like "So got any girls on you mind?" Alot of the time they take it jokingly and they'll answer to it.|`|I71n2XTRaa	judt be like     how are youu     hws the girlfriend  and if he denys having a gf you will knoo     ;]]|`|EdOKAnB9aa	just ask him i don't think he will think you like him unless you make it sound that way just casually ask
9ozDCTDTaa	I am not really sure, but I feel very bad for you.  Do you have a nightlight on in her room so that she isn't scared when she wakes up and can't see anything?  At 9 months old they are much more aware of their surroundings and it might be scary for her to wake up and see nothing but black.  Also try putting on some soothing music before she goes to sleep and then leave it on at night so that if she wakes up she can hear that same soothing sounds.  Best of luck:)  Oh and has the DR checked her ears and ear infection can cause trouble sleeping, there is more pressure on the ears when she lays down
qXq0nmBzaa	Tschnavia. It's a girl's name pronounced Sha-NAY-vee-ah.    At least Rocco is a traditional name that doesn't require continual explanations. Actually, if it flows well with the last name (of Italian or Spanish descent), it could be really cool.    Rocco Schmidt, on the other hand, isn't so great.|`|VGij9p0Taa	The worst name i pretended to like was Porschea Lotus my friend's sixteen year old sister baby was named this. She is absolutely adorable with big brown eyes and blonde curly hair, I always think she deserves a better name but hey its her child. When i first heard it i started laughing thinking it was a joke however it wasn't and to her face i pretended i adored it so i wouldn't upset. But i think its dreadful no offensive to anyone who likes it!|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Beulah (sounded like Beeeeeww)  Esmeralda (they called her Essie May)    Leonard (called Leo)  Horace (we just called him, LOL)|`|CMuL7XpKaa	My family has weird names because we are forgein. But someone i knew had a girl, Emerson. I wanted to laugh because the my sisters tv is an EMERSON "Emmie". her siblings have average names (Kaitlyn & Christian "Katie & Chris"). It also has the word SON in it and sounds like a last name (i once knew a girls named Carly & Summer Emerson)|`|5DK546BUaa	http://wesclark.com/ubn/faves.html    The absolutely worst baby names can be found above...|`|doLyOac0aa	Cassidy for a boy,|`|i405qKokaa	Burkrat...ewww, and he was English!Possibly seconded by Darvis (stupid name!)|`|7drjpohUaa	Hm interesting question. I like the first name of my aunt's new baby (It's not born yet, but she has the name picked out) but it doesn't flow well with the middle name. It's Lillian Leigh. It sounds odd, right? I've never met anyone that had a terrible baby name, although celebrities name their children pretty awful things. Rocco is...interesting. Roscoe would have been better, because then the nickname could have been Rocco.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Blade :o\ I was working in Santa's grotto and a couple came in with a son called Blade...And my best friend wants to call her daughter Dove or Pearl.|`|ksXayEUoaa	Rocco is a cool Italian name!

We played with and gave gifts to children whose parents were in Jail. I saw some pretty awful names. There was an Imani (eh-MAH-nee), Nahil (boy, nah-HEEL), Cianni (She was SO cute though! See-ON-ee), Jazzmen (Jasmine), her sister Janaiyah (Jan-EYE-uh), and worst of all: Tarzjanae (I forget the spelling. Tar-jah-NAY). I was doing face painting, and Tarzjanae asked me to write her name in cursive using a face paint crayon on her arm, because I had done it for Imani. She had to spell it for me about 5 times! Every name I heard I would be like, "Wow. That's so UNIQUE!" and then  smile at the parent (or aunt or grandmother).|`|LKbMSajFaa	braithwaite. how awful is that?|`|1ScoQM0faa	there is a woman where i used to work who called her girl ocean and her boy river..well i sddnt really know what2say when she told me|`|bzkSIJYnaa	Me and my best friend were talking about are favorite names for girls.

I don't know that many babies lol.    I guess Selah, like [[See-luh]]  Well and 4 of my cousins names,    Elijah  Isaiah  Henry  Linus     I think the first two are way ugly,  the third is too old fashioned and   the fourth reminds me of either Charlie Brown  or Anus.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	Well, it was my husband that did this. We were out to eat and we ran into this lady her knew and she had her newborn daughter. I didn't know this person so he was the one talking to her. He asked what the baby's name was and the lady says "Pierce". This was a little girl! My husband goes "oh that's so pretty!". I was thinking to myself, is he crazy? Then we walk out of the restaurant and he says "wow poor kid that name is awful" haha.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Chase. my best friends youngest sons name she has 6 kids. 25, 24, 19, 16, 3 1/2  , 2 and i knew someone who's realy first name is Cotton I felt bad for him he went by his middle name Ray|`|GNgp759Yaa	martha|`|AA11638341	biironn|`|BGIsuNMTaa	I worked in a nursery where a little boy was called Rocco and it didnt strike me as odd, i supose they grow into it so i wouldnt worry too much.

The name I had to pretend to like was Leland (pronounced Lee - land), at first I thought she might Leyland, but she said she had named him after Dog the Bounty Hunters son. I'd never heard it before although I'm sure a lot of people like it|`|Sw96YBvTaa	Someone i know has called his daughter Ariel (they even said after the little mermaid). I think it just shows how young they both were when she was born (they were 16, just). When his mother told me i had to pretend to like it, it was horrible. Even to this day i can't bring myself to say how's Ariel, i always say how is your granddaughter.|`|uSJPE4FQaa	My antie called thier baby Brant We call him buster but he is 8 now and my mom and dad said to me As much a they hate it just say it a lovely name even i wanted to shout "ARE YOU CRAZY!"

I truly hate the name Brie, and I have met a few of those. I've had to pretend to like other names such as Ronto, which I just found awful. I ALWAYS have to pretend to like boy names on girls, because I just cannot stand them (for example, Noah on a girl). Celebrities name their children awful things as well. Another name I found quite cheesy was Justin Credible. Those are just a few! Very interesting :]|`|btEAIjcuaa	Jalil|`|dQF5jOiLaa	Bob (for a girl)  Candice   Roxy   True  Tigger  Maude|`|hYeS0lXSaa	I really don' like the name Ashby-but that's only an opinion.|`|AmT1oIy9aa	well my family has a thing for naming kids awful names so i have three. the first is Jerikah Willa-Rose the second is Kadence Mckenna, and the third is Legend Hope. that last one isnt even a freakin name its a word like watd u word ur baby? lol so yeah|`|123d1094b4ce78cfd1c5a127e6c35a07aa	Hesther - she is only 3 but it sounds like a 90 year old's name (sorry any other Hesthers out there!)|`|QPFKlldAaa	One guy named his baby "Gay"    I wonder if it was a joke.

They renamed him tho. lol|`|jrRISXvHaa	I believe Madonna has a son named that.  It would not be my first choice, but its their child and they get to name their child anything they want.

It sounds like a goth)
coVZ1uqCaa	Okay. Do you want my opinions on them too ? I'd be glad to add them.    If I add a '-' to the name, I dislike it. If I add a '+' to the name, I like it. If I don't add anything at all, it's alright.    Juliana Lauren. I'm not very fond of the name 'Juliana', but Lauren is alright. The name will flow better if it was 'Juliana Laurene.'    Carolina Ellanor. Again, not very fond of the name Carolina. Caroline would be nice ! Ellanor .. I like that name. Though I prefer the spelling Elanor.     Jezabel Lillian -. I don't like it. Sorry. Jezabel is too extravagant. Lillian is somewhat acceptable for my tastes.     Lilly Anne +. I like it. The way the name sounds, not totally how it's spelled. I like the original version of Lilly, which is Lily. I'd like the middle name a whole lot better without the 'e' at the end.    Andrea Nicole +. I like Andrea. & Nicole works well as a middle name with it.    Elizabeth Rose. Elizabeth is just too common from my perspective. Too overly used. Though if you like the way it sounds, why not try Elisabeth ?    Emily Cecilia. Again, Emily is the most common girl name at the moment. Please try to avoid that spelling if you like the way it sounds. How about, Emilie ? Ema-Leigh ?    Tina Lillia -. Please don't try to add two names that both end with an 'a' together. Too much going on.     Jocelyn Colette. Sounds French. I like Colette, not totally amazed by the name 'Jocelyn' though.    -----|`|VGij9p0Taa	I'll gladly rate them...   Juliana Lauren - 7/10 two nice names that flow really well however i prefer Lauren Juliana either way its good though.

QCIQP3Kbaa	I agree with your parents. I'm 20 and my dad didn't let us watch rated R movies either...and now that I'm older, I've watched a few and I see why my dad said no when I was younger. But at 13, your parents really do know what's best for you. Trust them on this one. Wait a few years, show them that you are responsible, respectful, and obedient [sneaking behind their backs is never the best option] and then ask again.|`|	uhh maybe they wont let you see it because you're still a little kid?|`|	wait 3 years and tell them your old enough.|`|	You don't. You have to sneak it, like sneak into the movie, rent it pay per view, or something like that|`|	tell them you are gonna see something else and just go to the R movie instead..................|`|	Sorry, but you really can't. You have to be 18 to see one in theaters, or you have to be with someone over 21. If your parents don't want you to see one, then don't.   My parents barely let me see R movies either (I'm 14 and have only 2 R movies, but I didn't see half of one, and skipped some gory parts in the other). If your parents don't want you to see one, then you really shouldn't. They are R for a reason.   If you really want to see one, ask your parents politely if you can see this movie, and they'll most likely watch it with you if you can see it.  Other than that you'll be stuck not watching them, like the rest of us. Your parents are only doing this to protect you and don't want to expose you to this stuff. R movies also have a lot of gore and bad words and stuff, and from what I hear, are not always that good.|`|	idk I started watching R rated movies at 12 and my parents knew...but I understand why your wouldn't want you to. They probably say no, cause some of those movies have sexual parts in them and you can get ideas from them (trust me I should know).|`|	Well what movie? It depends.|`|	The reason your parents won't let you see an R rated movie is because they are for 18+ and you are just 13. Respect your parents wishes and watch an R rated movie when you're older.|`|	14 and still not allowed|`|	it depends what movie it is.
zNioznciaa	Every baby is different and gain weight at varied rate. All I know from my doc and from net that starting solid before 6 month is not a good idea if your baby is not ready for it. There are many signs that indicates that your baby is ready for solid,like he has good head control,he does not push out spoon with his tongue,he can sit with minimal support and also he has doubled his birth weight.So I think you have actually done a favour to your baby by stopping solid when you did.<br>  Secondly after 3 month the rate of weight gain drops.That is very normal.So if everything else is fine then don't worry.<br>  Babies usually double thier birth weight by 6-7 months,and if your baby has done that then he is developing nicely.<br>  If that has not happened then he is 6 month now and you can start solid,so he will very quickly reach this milestone.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Regards.|`|dMM4yD6Kaa	Babies come in all shapes and sizes as do adults.  He may just be a little smaller than his peers.  The important thing to see is the number of wet and poopy diapers and if he is hiting his milestones and gaining some weight.<br>  Sometimes grains are rough on a baby.  Rice cereal tends to be constipating.  Some babies don't tolerate oatmeal until they are older.  Just something to keep in mind.  If he is sensitive it is better to find something the baby tolerates better. Also I have seen a lot of children have reactions to barely cereal so we are putting it off awhile.  My daughter is eating oatmeal.  No rush on the others for us.<br>  Avocado is a fruit and it is loaded with calories.  It might be somehting to try.  My daughter loves it and she is 4 and a half months old.<br>  Another thing is full fat yogurt.  Some say 6 months and up and some say older so you might want to see what your doctor says.  It also is calorie dense compared to other foods.<br>  With a little one food allergies/intolerances can change rapidly.   If something doesn't agree with your little one, try again next month or so.  Hopefully now that he is 6 months he will be better able to tolerate solids.<br>  BTW  Some doctors will tell you not to do solids until 6 months.  Just depends on the doctor.  So he is starting at a good age, and if it doesn't work now you can put it off awhile.  Truly solids right now are more for practice than weight gain.  Most fruits and veggies don't have as many calories as does breast milk or formula.  Avocado and full fat yogurt are the most fattening I know of.|`|ncb3eBh0aa	Don't worry about it.  My kids, now aged 6 and 11 years were on the charts for the first 2 months of their life then fell off -- couldn't even chart them! They were both breast fed exclusively for 3 months and we added food and cereal slowly.  My son was always really skinny and short.  This past year - actually since September - he's gained 27 pounds and has grown about 6".  He's now a beefy 90 pounds and at normal height with the rest of his 5th grade class.<br>  My daughter (6) is the skinniest and smallest kid in her class of 1st graders!  She looks like she could snap in half!  She currently weighs a whopping 34 pounds!!!  My advice is this -- if he is otherwise healthy, let it go.  He'll catch up sooner or later.  I wouldn't try to fatten him up because you don't know what the long term consequences will be from what he's eating. It sounds like he's just metabolizing quickly.  You are doing nothing wrong as a mom!!  You have not slowed down his developments.  When he's ready for solids, he'll let you know by keeping them down instead of spitting them up.  <br>  Good luck -- he'll grow up fine!!!

They can't make decisions for themselves!<br>  <br>  You could always delude him into saying something bad while he's making his speech. His ego might get in the way of his thought process and he might make himself look like a fool. <br>  <br>  Question: Is the picture still on Myspace, and did anyone show the picture itself to the principal. It's usually very easy to tell is something is Photoshopped (While line surrounding the object placed in, incorrect shadows, no shadows from object, etc.) unless someone is very skilled in Photoshop. <br>  <br>  In my opinion, I think that B should be kicked out of the running and giving an OSS, and the rest of the baseball team that participated should be kicked off the team and be prevented from joining the team next year. It's a Catholic school!|`|3Ib1DEtyaa	Approach your principal and tell him what happened on myspace!|`|092bea1320ac52f2f7cd0e47cb63f9e5aa	get him to have a test.. if he comes up neg for grass then sue for slander! ruin the jocks life period!

Don't you have freedom of speech at that school?  If A has no association with drugs at all, I would consider speaking to an attorney about a charge of definition of character suit.<br>  Have a debate between the candidates and show everyone how B practices dirty politics.  <br>  But given that the real politicians act the same way (dirty politics)  what does that teach the next generation? How to practice dirty politics.  I don't know about any one else, but when I watch a debate I want to hear about issues that concern the country, not about the other candidates.  There is way too much of that these days.<br>  The only choice you have is to either fight dirty like B is or sit back and see what happens in the end.  But I would seriously see a lawyer if you can prove it was B that posted that stuff.
45xNJ7Ncaa	I would.  And now is the time to start checking out doctors (if yours does attend at the other hospital) and the hospital itself (staff, rooms & what they offer).<br>  <br>  Sounds like the staff at your hospital aren't that great.   I know they try to decrease the medicine when your near delivery because the numbness causes ineffective pushing which can be hard on the baby but the staff should have an idea of when to do that.  They should also be able to fix one that isn't giving you relief (either by changing the medicine if increasing didn't work or having the line checked for proper placement).  <br>  I had an epidural with my second and didn't even feel my 10 lb baby tear me.  <br>  I also had an epidural/spinial for a d&e (surgery to remove the placenta after my cervix closed and placenta didn't want to detach) and didn't feel anything that time either.|`|DWZFIzOJaa	You have to remember that each pregnancy is different, just cause you felt no pain with one , does not mean that things will go exactly as they did with the other deliveries. Talk to your Dr and see if there are any other options, if you still feel uncomfortable then you may want to just go ahead and try another hospital...if that will make you feel more comfortable.|`|pVV0xPcqaa	I have never had the epidural..I have 2 kids and i am now prego with baby #3 and i deff having it all natrual ..No matter what your gonna feel pain ..|`|07dbecd577f9ea4a7031637996b39fbcaa	no it wasnt the hospital but i had the same expierience!  <br>  <br>  but i could not have gone thru the birth with out it!|`|24568902a3ee669fb0eaf1a3eeb998cfaa	well some people handle epidurals diffrently i dont think its the hospital i think its just maybe you good luck and take care but if you want to try it by all means go for it|`|zpecfW9Waa	I had epidurals with both my deliveries and didnt feel a thing.

I've heard that it can cause foetal blindness though.|`|AA11917750	taking to much aspirin, tylenol, etc can cause damage to the liver. i'll pray for all of you! best of luck!|`|d148ce91fb5b35113dd06adfd1bf688faa	The problem with overdosing with aspirin is it can cause gastric (stomach) bleeding, liver and kidney toxicity.  It also thins the blood to the point that other internal bleeding can occur.  This endangers your SIL's life as well as the baby's because aspirin crosses the placental barrier to the baby. One of the biggest worries with this are the fragile capillaries in the baby's brain.  It can cause intercranial hemorrhage. I know this is all hard to hear, but since you asked the question, I assume you want the truth.  This can be extremely serious.  I hope they can get to her in time to pump her stomach.  I'm so sorry she did this.  I hope she and the baby are ok and she gets help.  I'm sure child and family services will be following this closely.  Unfortunately, they will probably be involved after the baby's birth.  <br>  RN|`|6k5g35Maaa	She should be fine.  I know that they tell you not to take aspirin while pregnant.  What was she thinking.  She should of just broke up him and hit him for child support.  I know that's your brother but what a loser.  I'll keep you in my thoughts and prays.|`|D2t8950Uaa	Oh- that is terrible.  I don't know if the baby will have damage...... 20 aspirin will not kill your sis in law though.  They will pump her stomach.   I hope the baby will be ok.  It will be hard to tell.  If they were able to get the aspirin out of her body quick, without absorbing too much into her blood..... maybe the baby will be ok.  I'll say a prayer for them.|`|YmlIsrNTaa	This is what I found on aspirin and pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Salicylates have been noted to cross the placenta and enter fetal circulation. Adverse effects reported in the fetus include mortality, intrauterine growth retardation, salicylate intoxication, bleeding abnormalities, and neonatal acidosis. Use of aspirin close to delivery may cause premature closure of the ductus arteriosus. Adverse effects reported in the mother include anemia, hemorrhage, prolonged gestation, and prolonged labor. Aspirin has been used for the prevention of pre-eclampsia; however, the ACOG currently recommends that it not be used in low-risk women. Low-dose aspirin is used to treat complications resulting from antiphospholipid syndrome in pregnancy (either primary or secondary to SLE). In general, low doses during pregnancy needed for the treatment of certain medical conditions have not been shown to cause fetal harm, however, discontinuing therapy prior to delivery is recommended. Use of safer agents for routine management of pain or headache should be considered|`|wTiDA0JFaa	I wish her and especially the baby well. But if she is that stupid and selfish then she probably doesnt deserve to be a mother...No loving mother in her right mind would ever do anything to harm their child...Have her evaluated by a psychiatrist and kept there...I would even press charges on her for the sake of the baby.!!!|`|Kg5KX432aa	:( <br>  I'm so sorry to hear about this. It is tragic that she would do something so irresponsible to her unborn child, no matter how big of an idiot her husband is. <br>  Aspirin is horrible for babies. it is one of the leading risk factors to an unborn fetus (aside from smoking). She could very well still have the baby, but have one with major deformities.|`|uecwFz0Daa	I would suggest that you delete this question.  Your SIL does not need this information on the internet.  You will just have to wait for the news from the doctor.
5edc4c06e43679e2ec64a4f4b601fed1aa	Well I personally think she is too young to follow a schedule. It's great that you are trying to introduce it now and I'm sure it'll take in the next few months. Some people are lucky. My daughter slept through the night, with the exception of one feeding, at one month. Your doing a good job. Just hold in there. Soon your baby will start to respond to you and smile and laugh. And believe me, it makes it all worth while! Here's an article that might help you http://www.babycenter.com/404_should-i-p...  Good luck!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	babies make their own   period|`|t1fx6kXcaa	It's impossible to have much of a schedule with a newborn. You can bath, baby massage and read to your baby at around the same time but feeding and sleeping is pretty much done on your baby's terms. Not sleeping on her own and frequently waking up is normal and typical of a 2 month old baby.|`|vjsT8DMIaa	welcome to the life of being a mother, and having a newborn. At 2 months old, they do not have the concept of "schedules"...its pretty much they do what they want...eat on THEIR time, sleep on THEIR time and are awake on THEIR time. Yes, you can do the bath, bottle, story and such...but thats not saying that they are going to go to sleep right afterwards. Why is it so hard to just tend to your child when they need to be tended to? Every child is different. Yes, some babies may sleep through the night from day 1...but thats not saying they have a set schedule. I say go around your babies needs....they are only young 1 time!!
r0ISrLc1aa	ok when i looked it up the first thing that came up was 15 grand. but that'll also vary depending on the condition that it's in. try carmax.com. wait im assuming it would be used?? carmax is used and new cars.    ok well i just looked and i couldn't find any beetles on carmax from 1998 but there were 2006 that ranged from 10 grand to 16 grand, so i hope that helps with the price range thing. if you try different areas on carmax you can probably find a '98.

457db30f68586ffe5e0ebc94a4dba769aa	There's nothing wrong with a man wanting to have children.    However, the man in your scenario above sounds mentally unstable.    Especially the whole part about "he can never trust any woman with this unless it is his mother..."    Sounds like a PSYCHO.  (And a controlling psycho, at that.)  I would run as fast as I could from that guy.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Yeah you better run and run fast.

qGQCLFinaa	I think you need to come to terms with it.   I was molested from the age of 2 up by different men we knew & i too was raped by my mom's ex-husband, he's still in my town & i run into him occasionally & my heart starts beating really fast & i start to get panicky, (i have anxiety) but i think my promiscuity as a teenager was because i was sexually abused so much as a child,  I still have some anger issues from it, I never went to counseling or anything, I've managed to put it behind me somewhat, but occasionally it comes back into my head.... My sister was also abused by her dad (the same guy that did that to me)  she also has some anger issues but nothing comes out until she drinks & then all her hurt & pain come out.    I would really advise you to talk to someone, try to get into conceling, even if it's someone at the school, they are there to help you, and they are free, you're there 5 days a week, you need to talk to someone, because if you can learn to deal with it, you're going ot have a really hard time in the future, I've been able to move past this, I'm not "promiscuious" anymore, I've been with the same man almost 6 years & have not so much as kissed or thought of kissing another man.  My best advice is to talk to someone, learn how to deal with it & don't listen to what other people are saying, there will ALWAYS be people who dont' like you, either cause they are jealous or they just don't like you for some reason.   Surround yourself with positive people, people that make you laugh & feel good about yourself.  People you can trust.   You can always call a teen crisis line too there are many websites out there too, You just need to do something to get this off your chest, or you won't get over this, It is still with me, everyday i think about what happened to me, but i also thank god that i am who i am today, that i have such a wonderful man by my side, who will never hurt me & always protect me.    Keep your head up sweetie.   You didn't deserve anything that happened to you, and SEX will NOT get you the attention you crave, make the guys want you! it's so much funner that way! tease them & show them what they CAN'T HAVE.  You'll really get some attention then ;p the guys that use you now, are doing just that, and believe me! I was "SO IN LOVE" so many times & i gave him what i thought he wanted & because he "loved me" but it was never that simple, guys get over it as soon as they get it, they like the chase.  To make a change, it all starts with you!! make that step & keep you're head up as you go!  Good Luck!!!  (also don't listen to anyone out there who says you are a troll, they just want their 2 points & don't have an answer for you, either that or the way you're wording things makes it sound like a troll like question, don't sweat it, just say I"M NOT A TROLL THIS IS SERIOUS! and people like me will answer.

Yes you need a therapist to control your urges to have every boy's attention on you, I'm specially worried about your brother's issue, believe me if you end up committing incest with him you may regret it for the rest of your life, don't let your rapist control your life with his words you can have a good life, get help.|`|x9REbxP1aa	Uhhh well let's see....    8-12 guys you've f*cked.

Yes,  we are affected by our first sexual experience regardless of who what when or how it took place.  The sad thing is, that you have been emotionally interrupted from developing a healthy sexual identity because the trauma of rape.  The pain is reflected in your behavior and know that this was NOT YOUR FAULT.  I always said that there is a special place in "HELL" for people that violate children like this because it disrupts the child's innocents  and children have to feel safe with adults to allow them to lead them and properly be cared for.   Trust is a major key in any relationship and these actions destroy a child's natural ability to "TRUST."   Seek Counseling to work through your issues.  xoxoxo  My prayers are with you.|`|cFFa6FW3aa	You're not a slut hun (:    Just take a test like i said in the other post.

I know this is a fact because the doctors told my sister that she couldn't have kids either, and she now has a daughter. My mom told my sister to name her Angel because she is an Angel.

Just because they got lucky all those other times doesn't make a person infertile.    Never trust a man who says "I'm sterile" unless he's been medically proven to be by a fertility specialist.    And the guy that you were with on your period could still be the father. . . you could have ovulated a bit early and sperm can live for up to 5 days. You are going to need a DNA test at birth, it's the morally reponsible thing to do for both your child and the men involved.|`|jtjISk6qaa	means he was lying or you were sleeping with another guy|`|DQkDQraOaa	You're going to need a paternity test in order to know for sure. Just curious though; how does this guy know that he can't father children? And why are you having unprotected sex with anyone? I'm not talking about birth control - I'm talking about PROTECTION. Since you are already a mother, you should know better. What would happen to your child if you ended up with AIDS?|`|VAI6MtPIaa	You can still get pregnant when you have your period.     Possibly a miracle! The guy who claimed he couldn't have kids may be overjoyed by this!    Congrats!|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Yea Honey, I think he was lying too|`|qpGbQ3Zlaa	Miracle baby  :]|`|8NZhwczwaa	liar|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Well, I guess he was wrong.  Guess he's going to pay child support too.|`|fh6TgqENaa	Well Ovulation can always come at different times no matter how regular you are. More than likely though b/c you were still on your period for the first one, the baby would be for the 2nd.I have heard of thousands of guys who say they can't get a girl pregnant pop up with babies!
Snk7E4Tlaa	It doesn't sound like he wants anymore kids.<br>  <br>  He's already had a child with another person and he's not with her.<br>  <br>  Sounds like he wouldn't stick around if you were pregnant. <br>  <br>  Do you really want to raise a baby alone?  If you do, I'd suggest you see your general practitioner and discuss it with them.|`|FvgKNPPbaa	How does he know he has a low sperm count, did he ever get tested because that is the only way a man can find out if his sperm count is low he has to get tested.  If that is the case that's not very fair to you that he is just telling you after the fact.  If you feel you are on your on like you stated then maybe he is not the one for you (sorry) or maybe you should at least wait until he is ready to be a father again. Also if he already has a child then his sperm count can't be that low.|`|nNgIseIjaa	well that doesn't sound like a healthy relationship because its not fair for you. In this case, hes the one with the problem. But go to the doctor anyways to see what you can do.|`|5OTjTavkaa	Fertility Enhancing Herbs<br>  <br>  Naturopathy is gaining a lot of popularity these days. It is no doubt the safest way to manage diseases and symptoms. Here are some useful herbs that help to boost fertility in men and women. Used individually or as a fertility blend, they can help you increase your chances of getting pregnant significantly and with very few side effects. However, it is advised to use caution when combining herbs with prescription or over-the-counter medications, as some react adversely together. Most of the time, if you are taking fertility drugs, it is very advisable to NOT take herbal remedies at the same time. Always seek the advice of your health care provider or naturopathic doctor before taking anything.<br>  <br>  The herbs listed below are among the most popular for enhancing female fertility:<br>  <br>  Black cohosh - this is an antispasmodic which relieves cramping. You may take this herb in the first half of your cycle from menstruation to ovulation.<br>  <br>  Dong Quai - considered a female hormone regulator and an effective toner for the uterus. It should be taken in the first half of the cycle and in others the second half. It is advised to check the label for dosage information and consult with your healthcare provider or physician before taking Dong Quai at all.<br>  <br>  Evening Primrose Oil - helps to increase fertile quality cervical fluid and also contains essential fatty acids which are good for the brain. You may take this EPO from menstruation to ovulation and switch to Flax Seed Oil after ovulation. Flax Seed Oil contains the fatty acids needed to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Evening Primrose Oil causes uterine contractions - which is why you should not take it after ovulation in the event that conception did occur.<br>  <br>  False Unicorn- helps with ovarian pain and female infertility. You may take this herb in the first half of cycle from menstruation to ovulation.<br>  <br>  Red Raspberry Leaf - You may take this herb during the entire cycle as it strengthens the uterine lining, thus helping to lengthen the luteal phase. But do ask your healthcare provider about continuing red raspberry leaf once pregnancy occurs. Usually, it should only be taken in the last trimester of pregnancy, because it ?tones? the uterus. <br>  <br>  Vitex (Chaste Berry)- Known as the female herb, it helps to regulate hormones and should be taken either the entire cycle or the first half from menstruation to ovulation. <br>  <br>  It is certainly not necessary to take ALL of these herbs at once. Pick and choose which ones you may need and which ones will benefit you the most. Some cover the same areas of fertility enhancement while others offer a more general supplementation. These herbs come in different forms - tablets, capsules, tinctures - and in many different brands. They also come as fertility blends where you can benefit for the synergized effects of all herbs in the right dosage. Choose the formula you prefer and choose a brand that is reputable and pure.

If he was hiding the truth from you for so long i have to wonder what else is he hiding
r5OJyawnaa	First I would like to say congratulations!!!!!What do you mean should she keep the baby? Youre just going to kill it and you think its all going to go away. Your daughter made a big mistake; I did the same thing when I was 17. I was a senior and I didnt get home schooled, I walked to school every day and graduated. My daughter turned my life around. I cant tell you how much I matured from the moment I found out I was pregnant. First of all abortion never crossed my mind. I dont know how anyone thinks its okay to just kill their baby because their not ready or they dont want to take care of the baby. If your not ready or dont want a baby keep your legs shut! But then again people are human and make mistakes and sometimes you just have to bite the bullet. You shouldnt even give your daughter the option of abortion. Do you think your daughters baby doesnt have a right to live?  Why should you decide who lives or not, thats for God to decide. If you dont think your daughter is ready you could always think about adoption. Their is so many people who cant have a baby. I dont think you should tell your daughter to get an abortion. Thats just the easy way out. Your daughter made a mistake and now she has to face the consequences. Can you and your daughter live with knowing she killed her baby? Always thinking about what your granddaughter or grandson would have been like. Im not trying to sound like a crazy Pro Life person but I just feel its wrong. Do you really want your grandson or granddaughter to be killed and then taken out of your daughter and then in the dumpster for garbage pick up? You were born werent you? So why should your daughters baby be killed? Your daughter made a mistake but so what everyone does. Now its time to face reality and deal with it. Right now is very hard for your daughter, yelling and criticizing isnt going to help. You have to be their for her every step of the way. She needs you more then anything right now. I went through this whole thing; I know how your daughter feels. I was in high school. I was embarrassed. I didnt want anyone to see my stomach. I didnt tell my mom until I was 6 months because I was so scared she would freak out. But now everything is fine! My daughter is the best thing that ever happened to me. I hope you do the right thing. Good Luck! God Bless!|`|9b36cd20c83580627b271744d6046be0aa	No disrespect intended, but you need to stop being her friend and start being her father. My parents punished me when I did something wrong...when I was little I was spanked, older I was grounded. She sounds like she needs a little discipline.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Yep its a troll. If you ever find yourself with "real" kids please opt to  abort. The world can not handle idiots who think it is acceptable for 12 yr olds to have sex.|`|eya1WDS4aa	I would say adoption is probably the best unless you want to raise her child. Abortion might be to emtionaly tough on her.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	aborting her baby won't help her. she needs to take responsibility for her actions by actually raising her child! maybe you need to reconsider your tactics, cause obviously talking to her just isn't working anymore. talk to the baby's father and parents and work something out as far as child support goes. you don't need to be taking full financial responsibility on your own, the other parents need to help also.|`|9Sgp7Mqmaa	I cant advise whether to abort the baby or keep it because that is only a decision you and your daughter can make, but I can offer some advice      A 12 year old body is not old enough to handle sex let alone have a baby, yo have to think of the health risks, becuase there is no way she can handle an entire 9 month pregnancy, she will most likely have it premature.      Talk to her about what is was like for you to have kid so young and the other family members as well.    As far as punishment goes you need to have some structure, because having sex at 12 years old is very dangerous, while the relax approuch works in some cases it often get the teen or preteen thinking they are way more mature than they think resulting in a situation like this.  You need to helpful, but at the same time dissapointed.|`|Ar6wD9Oeaa	wow, you put a lot of thought and time into this question. Such an imaginary mind to be coming up with such an elaborate story.    First thing you did wrong [hypothetically],  letting you kid have sex that early. ... a year earlier. t hats just sick man. and you should be reported to ccps. ANy good parent knows NOT to ALLOW sex that early.  so ....  1.) nothing you can do, will change the emotions for this outcome. she'll be damaged either by childbirth or my an abortion.    2.) uh, the pattern is clear. it's ignorance. clearly you didn't have any better morals for your children than you had for yourself. You suppose to learn from you mishappenings ( i will not call a child a mistake) and teach your children to do better. This is why there is so much poverty.    3.) um, yeah, How bout you do teach a lesson, make her have teh baby and give it up for adoption. Can you imagine what life would be like for you daugher who is going to be 20 with an 8 year old. Thats just messed up.  and keeping that baby around is not going to be very helpful in teaching her how to change her patterns.      I still think your a troll, but.... thats my answer for if by some chance you did happen to sign up for this today.    jennifer t: Just because in our society it is WRONG For a child of 12 years to have a child does not mean that it's not physically possible. If the body starts to release eggs and have  a menstrual cycle, then it is ready to have a baby.  You need to remember, as every generation progesses, woman are now having babys later and later in life. Most woman of this generation are having children in the late 20s early 30s and even some late 30s.    So by our societies standards (which i beleive we should follow b/c you can only be a child for a limited number of years) it is wrong to engage in sexual activity that early and to give birth to a child that early. BUt other cultures, countrys etc etc are giving birth to children at that young of an age, but the difference is, it's accept there by everyone.|`|qGQCLFinaa	Well as far as punishment or anything of that sort goes.... i don't tink you can really do anything about this.... I suggest being there for her as best you can, & finding her some support whether its friends & family or come kind of counseling.....  I think you need to have her to go term with this baby, and either help her take care of it or give the baby up for adoption, she is so young, you know you're going to end up raising your grandchild, my mom was 14 when she had me, and she wasn't ready to be a mother at all, she pawned me off on everyone else for 2 years until she finally decided to step up & take care of me herself.  She's going to need a lot of help, if you keep this baby, i would suggest finding her a support group for young teen mothers, something or anything to help her get through this, where is her mother in all this?  She's going to need all the support she can & a women in the picture would help things too..... I wish you all the best, whatever you decide.  But i honestly think, she wanted to act like an adult, so now she should be "responsible like an adult" if any of my kids got a girl pregnant (or if it were a girl)  I would expect them to sign over rights to me, or step up & be a parent,  kids want to go have sex & act like they're all grown up, but when something like this happens, they have no clue what they have gotten themselves into.  I really hope it all works out for you, good luck to you & your daughter & congrats to you for being such a responsible father.|`|9xgGd9praa	Worst parent ever award goes to you!|`|AA11728995	Just tell her to name the baby "VaGeena." She will definitely learn her lesson.|`|FsFUo4VJaa	Not to be mean but the best punishment would be for her to have the baby and have to take care of it PLEASE do not abort it that will not teach her anything she needs to know how much work it is to have ababy and I bet ya money she will not have sex with out a condom ever again. Good luck!|`|e9be6c195ded822caeb1d2fb369d0ef0aa	1: The legal age of consent is MUCH older than 12(IE, 16 in most states!!!!!!!). Letting her have sex THAT young is just plain immoral and a very stupid decision on your part.  2: You need to set an example for her. Don't let her do what she wants!  3: YOU should keep the baby. Adopt it for her, seeing as how she's still a child. Don't abort, Karma is a betch.|`|7b0903c0e39a55a5230350128e4fcff1aa	Your daughter is 12 years old and having sex? and YOU know about it and is OK with it? You need to stop being a friend and be a father to her. Take her to the Doctor and discuss this with him.|`|5D0KuT74aa	one question, no answers, joined today, unbeliveable question  yep, its a troll|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	I think it all depends if YOU want another child as she is too young to be a parent. I al;so think that you need to be a parent and make some hard decisions. What about adoption?|`|HnWKJLZoaa	WTF mate|`|iZDsMCghaa	You come across as a compassionate and wonderful father :-)  I agree talking is best and when punishments are due they should be relative to "crime".  With that said, I can see this must be a very difficult situation but I also see that you realize whats done is done and now its time to handle it, not dwell over the negative aspects of it.  As a mother myself, this is how I would handle it (husband agrees). She is awfully young so Im not sure how she will handle the pregnancy PHYSICALLY speaking. I dont agree with abortion, however if during the pregnancy she was no longer able to carry the child or she would die, her being so young herself, that may be the way to go, sadly but otherwise the plan would be, she goes to term, and we get through it together. She made a mistake which kids often do and what she thought would never happen, did. I would have her continue school and I would care for her child. When she was home, she would do homework and take on her role as mom, with our . guidance from us and other outside resources. She would have limited time alone just as with parents of any age This would continue until she was done with school(and/or college) so that the day would come when she can support her little family on her own.  I wouldn't be happy about the situation but its already been done. And with the right support she can be an excellent mother.   Aside form my own abortion stance, she is 12yo and cant totally grasp what it would mean and may prove to be emotionally traumatizing for her and I dont recommend taking that route. In time, things will get easier after the rough start.
9kPPmazoaa	The light spotting could easily be implantation bleeding. Also since your period is late, now is the perfect time to take a test. I also experienced cramping with implantation bleeding and during pregnancy. So definitely take a test... It very possible you are pregnant. Good Luck!!!|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	You can be. You should take a test to be sure. But I had slight cramps when I first conceived so that could be it. And spotting is also a sign of pregnancy.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	I dont think that spotting is sign of pregnancy but cramping right now is a sign. Why dont u go for HPT?   Baby Dust to u :)|`|Nxv4qusRaa	Im in the same boat.. my last period was Dec 28, but ive had light spotting the past few days, which i believe is implantation bleeding!     are you sore or dizzy at all? ive been having nightsweats and dizziness.    i would take a early pregnancy test tomorrow with your first morning pee, and buy a 2 or 3 pack incase its neg.. you'll want to test again a few days later.    goodluck!|`|y8qL24Hzaa	I am having the same problem. I was due for af on the 25 and still nothing. I had a neg test yesterday. I am going to try and hold off testing for a few days. Good luck and baby dust.
6ndM8fNLaa	I think they are different and sound different. They are very cute names and it's not like they are going to grow up and wish that their names were different just because some people thought they sounded alike. They will love their names and as long as you do too, then that's all that matters!|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I don't think they are too similiar.  I like them they are pretty.  Congratulations!|`|7drjpohUaa	The only way I can find a connection between Hannah and Annie is if you call Hannah "Anna." But you can just call her "Han," so it's not a big deal.     I think they are beautiful names! I love the middle name Leigh, it's too cute. Congratulations!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i like them|`|VpiYSQVnaa	the first names are fine but the endings on both names rhyme, that's kinda corny to me|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I don't think they are too similar at all! I could understand people saying that if you'd gone for Anna and Annie or something like that but Hannah and Annie aren't similar to me.    Sometimes I think people think of twin's names as being similar because they hear them together so often.    Congrats on your twins!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	I think their fine.|`|c5fd4a971e3c66ac1ba65c45a97fbf60aa	They're pretty similar.  I think they sound cute as individuals but it's a little much for twins.  Hannah and Annie.  IDK.  They're ok as far as names go, though!  :)    Congratulations on your twins.|`|AA11735792	Too similar, although I like both.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	Nope they are very cute :)  i'm due twin girls and I am deciding on Brooke&Bethany or Ellie&Elyse |`|iYRBbpGWaa	I think they go well with each other. I like your choices.|`|XoNKECCKaa	No they aren't! Those are really pretty names. They might think that they are similar sinch hannah could be nicknamed to anna which is kinda like annie (x  But no I think they are beautiful together!|`|qUS9Zwl6aa	They are cute. But I'm not sure if I would use them as twin names for my own children.|`|8rSoZxJTaa	i think they are cute!|`|cMYIWjD9aa	i think they're nice names|`|oXKwSkgsaa	Congradulations on the twin girls. I think the names are perfect because most twins names are like too simiar, so don't worry what everybody else says it's perfect, just perfect.|`|D0pQFlMIaa	Those are beautiful names, but yes, they sound very similar, even the middle names. I know they're not names you'd probably intend to shorten, but in a lot of families people will call each other across the house and use just the first syllable. For example, my name is Jennifer and my dad's is Dennis, and when I was living at home and my mom would call "Jen!" or "Den!" it was hard to tell who she was talking to. I'm sure "Han" and "An" would be even more hard to discern. Another thought to consider is that even though it is cute to give twins similar sounding names and celebrate their special connection, it will also be important to foster their individual identities. Maybe more unique names would have been a way to do that. But there are other, more important ways to do that.     All that said, if you loved the names more than any others, why let others stop you?|`|94aec4ccfaf29cf25396d222a449cc82aa	yeah, i think they're a little too similar.   and besides, Annie? it seems too nickname-ish. if you want to call her that, use Ann or Anna, instead..
yhpR2gNiaa	I would wait to start him on rice cereal. Formula is enough at his age. If you really want to start feeding him rice cereal I would talk to his doctor to see what they thought. I don't think he should eat rice cereal until maybe 4 months old.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I would ask your pediatrician what they think.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	yes formula is enogh   rice cereal no   ask doctor about maybe putting it in his bottle es   to young for the spoon|`|vjsT8DMIaa	formula should be enough at this age. I mean, they are 2 months old....their stomachs are probably smaller than the size of their fists. I personally wouldn't introduce rice until around 4 months at the youngest..but thats me. I don't mind feeding my 2 month old every couple of hours. He may be just hungry.. I would feed him instead of trying to put  rice in his immature belly to just keep him feeling full so you have to feed him less. Thats what newborns do...they eat every couple of hours.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	How many oz is he taking a day. You may need to just up the intake. He may also be going through a growth spurt which take a bunch of energy and calories form baby. He is too young to actually start on cereal. Wait to at least 4 months, 6 is the actual recommended age. Starting too soon, can cause many digestive issues for him. And it really has no nutrition at all , it is a "practice food" for when they are ready for solids and should only be fed by SPOON. Parents start off with cereal most of the time because the lack of allergens in cereals.     So say he is taking 3 oz of formula every 2 hrs, up it to 4-5 oz and see how much he drinks and make that amount for now and the amount of hrs in between may actually go longer to every 3-4 hrs. It is very normal for the newborns to want to eat a lot. They are growing rapidly right now. Good Luck Mommy!|`|vOomJtbsaa	It's not usually recommended before 4-6 months.  I'd definitely talk to your pediatrician about it before beginning baby on rice cereal.  It's also best for them to be able to hold their head up, sit up and act interested in food before beginning any sort of solids.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	Feeding every 2 and a half hours is normal. He is too young for solids. His digestive system is not mature enough to handle solids until 4-6 months. But closer to 6 months is recommended.|`|1VP9TUVOaa	some say it's ok. Some even mix cereal in formula. He is fine in my opinion. I didn't give my child anything but formula until he was 1. He ate baby foot and cereal, but no milk. I wouldn't start on cereal until about 5 months|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Do not feed your baby anything other than formula until you ask your doctor!      Your baby's stomach cannot handle anything more at this point.  At four to six months you can introduce mushy solids.    Ask your doctor!|`|CFFuFof1aa	Yes, I would do it for his breakfast and definitely at night. He won't wake up in the middle of the night as much. I will tell you that I prefer oatmeal cereal. Rice cereal, after they digest it expands. That is just what rice does after it is wet. Oatmeal is better for them and fills them up better. I started both of mine at 2 months. You will be able to tell a difference, I promise. Don't start out twice a day. Try just a little bit at his bedtime bottle and slowly increase the amount. Sounds like you have a healthy baby. Good luck!    My doctor said to wait until they were four months, but come on, the doctor isn't the one having to feed them every two hours and stay up with them at night. I was kind of scared to start my first one at 2 months, but my mom talked me into it. It was a blessing and I promise it won't hurt the baby. It can digest it. My mom said she started all four of me and my siblings at 6 weeks and we are just fine!! Good luck!|`|s30Duwdraa	My babies were the same way.  I breastfed and it seemed like i was being "milked" every 2 hours religiously!  It was very tiresome!    We decided to try a little bit of rice cereal at exactly 2 months (1 tablespoon, mixed with formula), once in the morning and once at  night.  It definitely made a difference!    And they also slept longer, especially at night! It was a blessing for me!    Good luck!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no way! my 6 month old was barely having one serving! every two and a half hours is not that bad! hes a baby try and space him out.|`|DNygQdmVaa	doc says to wait for any solids until at leadt 4 months, so i wouldnt.  it seems like a lot, but thats normal, my son atre that often at 2 months too.|`|wPi7fLLxaa	formula and breast milk is the way to go, when he is 6mo is when you can start feeding him rice cereal. But at 4mo you can mix the rice cereal with his formula and he will be more satisfied.|`|U6aOYS65aa	how many ounces maybe you should give him more formula|`|xRRMg4Zwaa	No I really dont think so, my sister has a 7 month old, and up untill a month ago, we where told by doctors ect only to give her milk, here stomach cant digest it.  But check with a professional. xx|`|5edc4c06e43679e2ec64a4f4b601fed1aa	At two months all they need is formula. Their stomachs are extremely tiny at that age.  Most babies can start having cereal at 4-6 months.   Check out this site for information on feeding you baby.  http://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-g...  Good luck!|`|EvswfDaRaa	No solid food until he gets to 6 months. this will help him to have less risk of weight problems as he gets older. all nutrients he needs are in the formula.|`|PhkWt9vEaa	Your babies' tummy is only the size of his fists put together, so feeding him every 2-3 hours is totally normal. Unless your baby can eat it from a spoon, then I suggest NOT giving him rice cereal. Many parents think giving babies rice cereal eariler will help them sleep through the night, but this is false. In fact, it is proven that rice cereal doesn't help them sleep through the night, it may even make it worse, because their digestive system is still semi-immune, and digesting the cereal can be hard on their systems, and cause painful gas. Rice cereal doesn't contain any nutrients that are needed for an infant at the age, only formula or breastmilk are needed. And feeding rice cereal at this age could actually hinder your daughters weight gain, because the rice cereal will be taking all the important, needed nutrients from the formula or breastmilk.     Signs to indicate your child is ready for rice cereal:    -Can your baby hold his head up on his own?  -Can your baby sit supported or by himself?  -Can your baby use his jaw muscles in a chewing fashion, instead of sucking?  -Does your baby swallow the food instead of pushing it back out with his tounge?    If your baby can't take rice cereal from a spoon, NEVER put it in a bottle. Many parents tell you its okay based on opinions, not facts. The fact is, if your baby can't eat from a spoon, then developmentally he isn't ready, and neither is his digestive system. Also, rice cereal in a bottle poses a choking hazard.    Best Wishes!

OzPehAR7aa	Those at home tests are not always accurate, I have had experiences with a couple of faulty ones. She needs to go see a doctor to check up. If she hasn't gotten her period in 5 months then that is a little suspicious..|`|cj7sSPZEaa	She needs to see a doctor.  If she isn't pregnant, there are several things that can cause you to not get a period:  Stress, rapid weight gain or loss, problems with the reproductive organs, eating disorders, and medications.  She needs to see a doctor to find out what's going on.  They can do a blood test to see if she is pregnant or not.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	Not necessarily. She may be experiencing what is known as a 'phantom pregnancy', which has all the symptoms of a normal pregnancy; eg weight gain; tender breasts. This may be why the tests have come back negative. Alternatively, she may have a menstrual disorder, which may indicate a problem in the pelvic area. Nonetheless, medical advice needs to sought. Drag her to the G.P if needs be. Woudn't she rather just know what she is dealing with? Good luck.|`|mlwBLJHaaa	Go see a doc she's prego probably|`|TYQOafA8aa	She needs to see a Gynecologist both for a 2nd pregnancy test and for a STD test, she could be infected with AIDS or some other disease.|`|zUXijLLuaa	Yes, definitely pregnant.|`|KhVyci6kaa	if she had sex without protection, no period in 5 months and is getting a little bigger than there is high chance she is pregnant. those home pregnancy tests can't always be right so i suggest she goes to her doctor and get it checked professionally.|`|cFFa6FW3aa	She could be, or her period is just irregular.

All the best for you and your daughter x|`|0bZ6j0aSaa	I like Abigail and Abby.  I don't like Aubrey for a girl as i've only ever known boys with that name, so to me it's a boys name. Sorry!

Good luck!|`|j7wESGaDaa	i don't really like any of them (i'm not a fan of such common names).  but i guess Aubrey Elise is my favorite.|`|83GG2y8gaa	i like the 2nd one.|`|GaOcJOgzaa	Aubrey Elise  Congratulations!! Beautiful names :)|`|vjsT8DMIaa	I really love Abigail Paige...but I think Abigail Elise sounds beautiful together also.|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Abigail Elise is, by far, the best name.    Aubrey is a gender-bender and "awb" is a horrendous nn. Sure, many people will use "bree" but "awb" will be a contender.    Abby is a nn. It's best to use the traditional, complete name because the child/grown up can choose Abigail or Abbs or Abby or Gail or anything else. Abby is limiting. While it's cute, it doesn't inspire confidence in an adult.    Paige is trendy, so "Charmed"|`|bQHkFe2yaa	The only one I like is Aubrey Elise, but I like Aubrey Paige much better.

From your list i really love  Aubrey Elise  I do not care for Paige,my daughter used that as her stage name when she worked as a stripper,thankfully for only a few weeks!

52bAHCaUaa	Baby cereal is not recommended until 6 months old age, 4 months at the earliest. Never put cereal in a bottle, only feed it to them on a spoon. :) Good luck!    You can add milk to the bowl of cereal, make it more runny...but you should still feed it to them with a spoon.|`|1aedb3e2dfe276d9756f4cf4095308efaa	You don't put solids into milk.|`|cAsakNO6aa	you can feed him rice with breast milk or formula or even juice! you can make it how soggy you want it or clumpy just test different things with him. you Will get it. dont worrie if he spits it out that dont mean he dont like it just means he is trying to swallow|`|f784827ff8765bb636882ae8004059ccaa	here in the uk its     What is weaning?   Weaning is what you do when you move your baby away from a milk-only diet to a diet containing a variety of solid foods.     When should I start weaning?   The Department of Health recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months. Unless otherwise advised by your health professional, solid foods in any form (baby jars, cereals or rusks) should not be started any earlier than six months. Many mums favour delaying weaning a bit longer and continuing to breastfeed, as breast milk is such a perfect food for a baby. Your baby does need to start eating some solids at about six months, though, as milk alone will not give her all the nutrients she needs as she enters the second half of her busy first year. With each baby you have to find the Goldilocks moment for introducing the first tastes of food; not too early, not too late, but the time thats just right. We explain why you shouldnt start solids too early, and why you shouldnt leave it later than six months.     Not too early Most babies are not ready for mixed feeding before six months because:       They cannot make all the right enzymes to digest foods.   They have not yet developed enough co-ordination to cope with the foods put into their mouths, and cant maintain the posture needed to swallow.   Their kidneys may not be mature enough to cope with anything more than milk.   If solid foods are introduced early, babies may be more at risk of developing allergies.   The early introduction of foods may be linked to an increased risk of respiratory illness, coeliac disease, and wheezing in childhood.   The early introduction of solid foods is associated with an increased percentage of body fat and may contribute to a child being overweight.     Not too late  Most babies are ready to try new foods by the age of six months because:       The stores of iron that babies are born with are running out; babies need to get new iron from foods.   Milk is a bulky food; babies have to take more and more of it to meet their needs whereas solid foods are more concentrated.   Their jaw and tongue have developed enough to cope with eating and swallowing foods.   The process of learning how to deal with foods helps a babys mouth and tongue to develop and helps a baby prepare for speech.   Most babies begin to cut teeth by six months.   Many babies begin to pick up things and put them in their mouth; a sign theyre ready to experiment with new tastes!     When and how to introduce foods   Your baby has been used to having nothing other than milk for all these months, so first foods may seem a very strange experience. You will need to give her time to get used to the idea, especially if she doesnt know what to do with the food you put in her mouth! To start with, choose a time of day when your baby is active; babies are more interested in new things when theyre alert rather than when theyre tired. Also:       Choose a time when your baby is not ravenous with hunger, because she will want and expect milk. But dont wait until shes finished her feed, either, because then she wont be interested. Half way through a milk feed may be a good time.   Hold your baby upright on your lap so she can swallow easily or sit her in her bouncy chair.   Offer the food on a small plastic spoon, or on the end of your clean finger.     Foods from six months   Start with baby rice, smooth purees of fruit or vegetables.     From six to nine months   Coarser purees of vegetables, chicken, meat, fish or lentils and pulses like kidney beans. Then lumpier finger foods including chopped hard-boiled eggs, cubed or grated hard cheese, pasta and raw soft fruit and vegetables. Some what-based cereals and bread. Cows milk products such as yogurt, custard, cheese sauce.     From one year   Your baby can now have cows milk as a main drink, soft cheeses, mild spices, honey and family meals, chopped up to bite-size. Before you add salt to your cooking, take the babys portion out.     First tastes   First tastes are exactly that, tastes. At this stage, breast milk or formula milk will still be your babys main source of nutrition for some time to come, so the amounts of other foods will be small. Its best to start with a thin, smooth puree, which is easy to swallow. For your babys first tastes, try purees of starchy foods like rice. Baby rice is a very popular first food. As you will only need very small amounts to begin with, a packet of baby rice is a convenient way to make up just as much as you need. Mix a teaspoon or two with cooled, boiled water, formula milk, or expressed breast milk. Once your baby has got used to the idea of solid foods you can add other tastes to the rice. Try vegetables such as pureed carrot, cauliflower, sweet potato, swede, butternut squash or potato. For fruits, good first tastes are purees of fresh pear, cooked plums, or ripe banana, which just needs mashing with some milk and then sieving.     What to avoid
0qP8gLpyaa	When they start leaking is my rule. I thoroughly wash and sterilize in the dishwasher  every day with my sons. They last for months. I just replaced them all and he'd been using the previous ones about 6 months. They started to look beat up and a few were leaking so I tossed them and got new ones.    I bought the Playtex Sport Insulate ones.  They work great and keep stuff at temperature pretty well.|`|mPfDlG2Laa	Change them?!?!?!  Wow, the more I hear the more I wonder how mine survived!!!|`|467be00aa9eff8cd86b019690cc79aa4aa	I changed mine every two months too when my son was younger.|`|eHow24rNaa	When my daughter was younger and on sippy cups, I would scold them in hot water for about 3mths then change to new ones after that time. Thats what her pediatrician told me|`|PJb8BNfiaa	If they looked a tad bit gross, I chucked those bad boys in the trash and got some new ones. I would also get the cheap but good kinds so it wouldn't hurt my pockets as much.|`|QC7i71mFaa	i dont get why you need to if you have a dishwasher or sterilse them and wash properly and frequently. i have tommee tippee once and you change the spout when they get chewed so not as expensive as a new cup

I liked Rylan and Trenton for a boy and Adrienne for a girl.    Although you've picked out some unique names, please consider that almost all of the names you've picked your child is going to spend the rest of his/her life pronouncing and spelling for people.      Mine is simple - Sara - but my entire life I've had to answer " is that Sara with or without an "h".  - It's annoying.

L6oSDA5Yaa	i think she is just excited that you guys are trying for a baby at the same time. Just let her know how you feel, maybe she doesnt realize she is doing it.

She talks about being pregnant all the time, I am happy for her but I had to tell her to not talk about around me while I heal. Anyway now that I'm feeling better she asks me if I'm trying again I said kinda because we are trying to let happen naturally, it bugs me too. This some friend who needs attention all the time, she even lies all the time to get attention.|`|9eaQye5zaa	That is really insensitive of your friend. I would sit her down and talk to her about how she's acting, It's probably not a conscious thing but she needs to know that it hurts you.|`|JemYTym5aa	It sounds like she may just be excited to share in the TTC journey with someone she cares about.

Bc0t4CDGaa	My daughter was a full 12 weeks before she smiled "for real".  She was not a big smiler her first year of life, and was just a serious little girl.  She would just stare at us to watch how we spoke and such, and was very smart.  I think she just was drinking in everything around her!    Today, she is 11 1/2 years old (and has 3 younger siblings), and is very happy and smiley, and still very smart and intuitive.  She is NOT autistic...I just wanted you to know that you shouldn't be worried about this.  Definitely not at 8 weeks!  Our pediatrician told us that typically you can *start* seeing some patterns of autism (if they have it) at around a year.      So, just enjoy your little guy, and try not to worry or obsess! :-)|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I've got two sons both diagnosed on the autistic spectrum, one regressed but had been developing typically, the other was born with it, we saw signs by 6 months, officially dx by neurologist at 9.  Both my boys smiled early on, but the eyecontact of the one born with it wasn't there from the beginning and wasn't content being held    I've heard other parents say their child was born with autism and they knew right away, not smiling at 8 weeks if thats all you got I wouldn't be concerned.|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	Your son is only 8 weeks! Give him time, he will smile. There is no point in worrying about autism, you're going to drive yourself insane. Babies develop milestones at their own pace. Don't get yourself worked up over nothing when your baby is only 2 months old!|`|OeXFNQXYaa	Yes i do have a child with autism hes 5 years old now he never flashed his first smile till he was 3 and they will not have direct eye contact and they delvople slower then other kids
X6tVveLzaa	Ear infections caused by a viral cold can be bacterial as well- the sensitive tissue has mucous buildup and is a prime location for the breeding of bacteria. Because it sounds like she has had several before, she may be particularly susceptible to getting them..... Is there a reason that you aren't taking her to the doc and getting it checked out?     As for the question, is it possible to clear it up on it's own? Well, yes it is possible. But this day and age bacteria infections are more resistant to spontaneous recovery. If she is running a decent fever or seems to be in pain, even a little, I would strongly suggest taking her in.     Best of luck to you and your little one! Hope she feels better soon.|`|28eef552af05089e5c3e3e4bda7ed4a9aa	If you had ever had an earache you wouldn't even question getting some help for the little guy! IT HURTS!|`|UOfitYbmaa	obviously you haven't experienced an ear infection!! I have multiple times and they are not pretty. the pain is unbearable and your child isn't old enough to express the pain he/she is feeling! take your child to the doctor and allow them to treat because allowing it to go away on its on is making your child suffer!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|Y0YHI3sUaa	Yes it can within 1 week. But it would be best to get an antibiotic. It will make it go away within a day or so.  Best of luck.
VVV7DSITaa	Greer is a hideous name, especially for a little girl! It's not feminine at all!   Kids are cruel, she'll get made fun of and called Queer, Rear, etc.  It doesn't even look nice, and it isn't easy to say. It's just ugly.|`|32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Amanda  Audrey  Amber  Regina..|`|Q87djE0laa	is greer you first name or maiden name coz either way its gonna be nicknamed queer|`|2e5de34714fb6552cfd392ccef6f7cf7aa	maybe Greer Olivia.  You definately need a soft feminine middle name because Greer is so harsh sounding.|`|EFYkci30aa	Something VERY girly because it sounds like a boy's name.      Please also consider that these words rhyme with Greer:    Queer, Pap Smear, Brassiere, and Beer, which would make for some horrible nicknames.|`|AA10166553	I love the name Greer. I knew a girl named Greer many years ago. How about:  Green Renee  Greer Suzanne  Greer Christine
LFXTpqfdaa	Whether or not you have the worms, you and your baby will be fine. Pretty much 100% of human beings had parasites up until this century, when water sanitization became commonplace. It's not dangerous, and they are easy to treat.    You probably don't have them anyway. You would have to get some of their stool in your mouth to swallow eggs. Since you're probably not cleaning the litter box these days because of the toxoplasmosis risk, the chances of you having their parasites are low. Besides, most cat parasites are specific to cats and while they can live in your digestive tract, they can't reproduce there, making many infestations self-limiting.     Please don't let your cats outside... I'm assuming that's where they picked up these worms. Outside cats live an average of 3-5 years and spread all kinds of disease. And I trust that they are spayed and neutered, right?|`|LUlpXkXLaa	I rescued a little cat about 2 months ago and at the time I was probably about 22 weeks pregnant. I took her to the vet because she was bleeding from her behind..they told me my cat had hookworms and roundworms and something else..they gave her a pill which would kill all of the worms. But the vet told me to stay away from her and call my OB..So I did and my OB said my best bet was to try to get rid of her and not take the risk. Mainly because I was cleaning her poop from the litter box. And even if you wash your hands afterwards your still not in the clear..Litter makes a dust (which contains small microscopic worms) and after you clean it the dust flies all over the air..making it really easy for you to ingest the air..The dust also tends to come out when your cat scratches after going potty. They also can carry the parasite on their nails..because when they scratch the litter, they are scratching their poop to hide it. So if they scratch you and draw blood and a parasite from their poop is on their nails..it can easily get into your system. My obgyn explained their are so many different ways to get it..Its just not from cleaning the litter..and some people just think that if they stay away from litter they are in the clear..but thats not true. I didn't want to take risk of getting anything, because a worm that is left go can eventually deform your child. So I decided i'd find her a new home because it was really unsafe for me to take care of her. I don't really know what to tell you..because i'm sure your in love with your little kitties..It just happened to be I only had her for about a week so i wasen't too attached and luckily I found her a great home! Good luck
FgAPXhVRaa	So I am a nanny too and I was only 18 weeks at the time they wanted me to fly and I would not. They know that you are pregnant and asking you to fly at 32 weeks... is uncalled for. I would have to say that unfortunately you won't be able to go. You have to think of your baby first. My employers were not the happiest people when I told them I would not be going but they got over it. Your employers should understand a little they have kids and realize the risks of flying that late in pregnancy. As nervous as you might be I would really put my foot down about this... nothing, not even a job is worth the safety of you and your baby!!! Good luck and best wishes!!!|`|V8uvefQDaa	Contact your doctor!! Im sure they will advise against it  x|`|5J7XrOcxaa	I recently had to fly for a death in my family @ 38 weeks pregnant.  Some airlines do not have a problem with it and some require you to have a "health certificate".  My doctor told me he wouldn't recommend traveling but understood that I was going to do it anyway.  They checked my cervix before I left and wished me the best of luck on my trip.  I took a copy of my records w/ me just in case anything did happen.  That I would highly recommend you doing.  Good luck!|`|xtieIDTyaa	I wouldn't fly that heavily pregnant, There is a higher risk of DVT [Deep Vein Thrombosis]  when flying if you are pregnant.|`|Rc08VYFtaa	Depends on the airline whether they permit you to fly anyway (cheaper low cost airlines stop women travelling from as early as 26 weeks for example) but even Birtish Airways has a cut-off point around 32 weeks I think ( you should check on their website it could be 35 weeks but witha note from your GP). I personally think its unacceptable that you are being expected to fly at this late stage and I would get my GP to sign a letter forbidding it, they would rather you were safe and well than put at risk by your employer.    Good luck if you do, but I wouldn't.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	at 32 weeks you should have a letter from the midwife and doctor anyway just incase you are ill and you need a letter to prove to most airlines that you are fit enough to fly|`|kykmpr0Caa	i thought you could only fly up to a certain time in pregnancy? check with your doctor if it would be safe for you and the baby to fly at this late stage in your pregnancy|`|LQnKhiVMaa	most insurance wont cover u after 28 weeks, and airlines can be a bit funny about it, (i went at 26 weeks and i got stopped , it took ages to allow them to let me pass, i had to show them my insurance, and even birth stuff, until they believed i was 26 not over), in turkey. i think regardless , i wouldnt fly at 32 weeks, but each to their own x  and i think u need a doctor snote over so many weeks too x|`|y0OwKPaMaa	The airline prolly won't let you on the plane.  You aren't allowed to fly in your third trimester.  At least not in my country.    Good luck!|`|WAEDIWz8aa	i dont think you should you.    ur baby first.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	You're not due to do anything if the airline doesn't allow it.  Most airline restrict pregnant mother to the "no fly" rule when they are in the third trimester unless a doctor has given them written permission that they can fly, and even at that the airline has the right to deny passage.  Check it out first so you don't have to go through unnecessary problems due to a selfish employer.|`|AA11206135	I think your doctors would advise against it.. (mom of five)|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Speak with your doctor. He or she knows more about your health record than us folks here on Yahoo.    ss

My wife broke out into rashes every time she ate pork when she was pregnant, but when she isn't pregnant, she is fine. When I say rash, I mean all over her face and chest. It's kinda the opposite of what happened to you. DR says it can happen her way, so I am assuming it can go opposite too.

6m6LjAVNaa	Stacey is the preferred spelling for a girl Stacy for a boy Stacie maybe your dog not a person!  no it is pronounced as stace--- eee  My niece is named  Stacey Lynn  Her mom loved my little sisters name so much she chose a name as close as possible to hers which is   Tracey Evelyn  Good luck,keep it real!|`|6qjeneB7aa	I don't think there is a "correct" spelling for this name, but there are some "wrong" spellings in my opinion: Stacei, Staycee, etc. Something ridiculous like that. But I know a Stacy & a Stacey, My favorite spelling is Stacey. It's a cute name, that is not heard often anymore.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I think ey or ie for a girl and just y for a boy it is a unisex name|`|ej51eWO7aa	however you want to spell it|`|gDEFlWnOaa	Stacy is correct, as is Stacey and Stacie.|`|ljFBfguRaa	They're all assumed to be pronounced the same.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	You can spell it either way. I'm not sure which one would be the "correct" but I think Stacy and Stacey and pronounced the same.|`|3ec2dc9c564affe4311fe2b01585ad71aa	I like it spelled Stacie. But Stacey, and Stacy are perfectly normal.

kWBXSjHXaa	Dude my parents do that all the time but still i think its there fault there just getting old and not remembering or they just say that so you can get out of there face lol|`|SRsFkNBBaa	they can do whatever they want, they are your parents. but to answer your question, i would never do that to my kids. when i say something i mean it. if i change my mind, i explain thouroughly why, which isn;'t very often. so no, they aren't being very fair.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Your situation is odd but they don't have to tell you - do yourself a favor and let it go, the reason why might have something to do with something that they aren't comfortable talking to you about I guess.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	Out of respect you need to let that go.  They are the decision makers because they are the adults.  No explanation is due you.  You need to trust their judgement before you get dragged out the door...|`|kBn4UaMUaa	Its tough and I do not think your parents are being fair at all. However, it is their right to change their mind. I think they should give you a reason though. I say becasue I said so to my child sometime, but I try not to. Its not really fair|`|cPMHKz4Oaa	Who is the friend you want to bring,  maybe there is something about him that they don't they don't like.  Is he or she of good character?  I let my daughter bring a friend home with her once and she stole some things from our house.  I didn't let her bring anyone else.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Well, you clearly weren't ready if you hadn't even called your friend yet! But I don't know why they wouldn't have explained it to you.    Yes, you are being a brat, though. If you were my child and too young to be left at home when you refused to come, I'd have picked you up and PUT you in the car, and if you'd objected you'd have had a sore backside in short order. Sitting on the internet asking about it? No WAY.    Your parents are not your friends, they are the ones in charge. If they choose not to explain things to you, that's their choice. Though this does sound...odd.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	You should be proud of yourself. In life you will find that you have to question things. For example, your landlord cant just kick you out without giving you a 30 days notice and an explanation. He or she cant say well because its my property and I say so. Your doctor can charge you some hefty price for a visit without telling why he or she is charging you. Your doctor cant say I am charging you because I am your doctor and I said so. So it is always good to get an explanation. It is good practice for your future in life.    ss
prqrQcd1aa	It depends on which virus is causing your stomach flu (viral gastroenteritis). A number of viruses can cause gastroenteritis, including noroviruses and rotaviruses. The contagious period  the time during which a sick person can give the illness to others  is slightly different for each virus.     Norovirus is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis in adults. Symptoms appear within one to three days of exposure. With norovirus, you're contagious from the moment you begin to feel ill. Although you typically feel better after a day or two, you're contagious for at least three days after you've recovered. Some people may be contagious for up to two weeks after recovery. Also, children are often contagious for a longer period than are adults.     Rotavirus is the leading cause of viral gastroenteritis in infants and young children. Symptoms of rotavirus appear one to two days after exposure. But you're contagious even before you develop symptoms, and you typically remain contagious for two weeks after you've recovered. Children are often contagious for a longer period than are adults.      http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/stomach...|`|FvhCUHjxaa	You can be contagious before you actually get symptoms and you can pass on the flu by being around somebody who is sick without getting it yourself. I had it 2 weeks ago and it was hell; I'm still pretty tired but I'm no longer contagious. The flu in children and adults can have different symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea in children and higher fevers than adults usually. I would wear a mask when you go to the hospital as you have been around people who are sick. Usually people are contagious for about a week. I missed a week of everything due to the flu.|`|6YeexwvAaa	Well...generally they say upwards to 5 days after you first show the signs of having the flu.    Children and the elderly are usually the only ones that get "sick" (diarrhea, puking) with the flu. That's the biggest difference between kids and adults. Adults (18-55) don't usually get "sick" with the flu.    Drink PLENTY of fluids. I actually just had it last week, and I'm still pretty weak and without much energy. I would just say rest and drink. That's all that will really help. I will also on medication, and that seemed to help a bit. There's nothing OTC though, so you'll have to see your doctor.    Good luck!
vSHkZWUoaa	no|`|i8Ch743Laa	NO,it's not true. If he's not "shooting out" He's not having an orgasm. He's lying to you.|`|A0NfgNEiaa	i think u shud talk to ur doc that just doesnt sound normal to me|`|MtOSX19Haa	He's either faking the orgasm or he has some plumbing issues.  My ex would only have the clear pre-*** and we never thought anything about it.  (Never really looked at the stuff either.)  We found out after years of trying that he was born without the tube to let the sperm get out.|`|bZBByJAAaa	Not true. I got pregnant that way. My husband and I never used protection but he never ejaculated inside of me because we were not exactly looking to have kids right away. It took two years of having unprotected sex with him pulling out before the method finally failed and I got pregnant. I was also thinking either one of us had a problem since I thought that after so many times I should have gotten pregnant because of the pre***(although I was just wondering and didn't really wanted to get pregnant). Chances are slim but they exist. Here I am now happily expecting my first baby.|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	pre-*** alone can make you pregnant|`|AA11348933	No. its not true.|`|OQ8jWholaa	its not like the thing is air tight....
eHow24rNaa	It all depends on the situation. If you are considered a threat to the child then you might have to have supervised visitation. But if you are giving your child to your parents because you know you cant take care of it on your own and your parents allow you to, then you could be able to see your son. You can also have it written down and documented that your parents have to give you visitation. Im sure that it will work out and if their good enough parents to take care of this new child, then they should be able to let you see your child. Good luck with this...i know its got to be hard on you.|`|wowxdZqZaa	Why in God's name would you do that?|`|jvW3a5GYaa	You would have to set it up that way legally.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Not unless they allow you to do so. Once they adopt you have legally signed over any and all rights to him.|`|DNygQdmVaa	only if its an open adoption.      unless your involved with CPS??  Then no you will not be able to visit.|`|3WWHWsHOaa	Not unless it is specified in an open adoption. Adoption means you are giving up all legal rights and claims to your child. You will have no say in how the child is raised, no legal expectation of visits, or even a legal right to know what happens to the child.
7HzfgRmwaa	I would say Nothing... At 2 months you shouldn't be obviously pregnant so I'm sure if they aren't rude they won't risk asking the famous are you pregnant question and be wrong.     There is nothing wrong with what you are doing. I believe I waited until I knew what I was having at 17 weeks to tell the people I worked with out of the same fear at first and then I liked it being just MY secret :)|`|gx4s68s8aa	Just say that you ate something that didn't agree with you.  Or you can tell her that you are on a new medicine or vitamin that doesn't agree with you all the time.  I know iron pills can make you feel sick to your stomach.  So you can always tell her that at your last doctor's appointment that you had your iron checked and it was a little low.  Lots of people have there iron checked when they are feeling tired, so she doesn't have to have any idea that you are pregnant.  And then later you can tell her when you are comfortable.    As far as the clothes- can you get a uniform a size larger?  If not then can you put a sweater or something over it to hide a possible tummy etc.    I understand your feeling.  We only told my parents right when we found out.  Then we told my in-laws at 13 weeks and over the next month all of our friends and other family members were told.  My sister had a miscarriage at 12 weeks and she told everyone she knew the moment she got pregnant.  So then she had to make a lot of difficult phone calls.  So I didn't want to have to do that myself.|`|aOjMf5SPaa	dont say anything. if they do get in your face - say it, but say there is a chance you could lose it, you would appreciate their discretion and sensitivity. back off. and they will.|`|iwYu32N2aa	Well at 8 weeks you dont have to worry about showing yet, and you can just tell her that you have the flu or something if she ask's about you getting sick in work|`|e9vcseLlaa	I think you should tell her and everyone else you havent told.  YOu dont want to risk a friendship yet. After all it IS your desicion to get pregnant not hers. And she cant stop you. Just tell her : "i have very exciting news!!" "im pregnant" Just say that and dont be afraid|`|cie3oBcXaa	Maybe say you put on weight over christmas? You could also say that you have a tummy bug at the moment to help cover the vomiting. Good luck :)|`|uuKTQ84Qaa	Say you are just getting fat !|`|JXXZIsBvaa	Ask her if she wants to start working out with you because  you feel like your clothes aren't fitting right anymore.  =]|`|nxHztcslaa	i really didn't want my friends to know im expecting yet, my daughter is only 9 months old and i'm just 7 weeks pregnant.. however she just came out and asked me.. do u want anymore kids soon? and silly me replies..'NOOOOO SHUT UP! I AM NOT PREGNANT!' lol needless to say i totally gave it away and now everyone knows... its disapointing as its still such early days.. so my advice to you is think of something to say if anyone asks.. maybe say u would love a baby soon or something, dont be caught off guard like me!!|`|X6P1q8gmaa	There 2 ways to go   1. act like your not,  if your sick make a joke about last night dinner, ask if the bug is going around etc.  2. if she is trusted friend let her know and that you are worried about losing the baby so you are not sharing the good news for a couple more weeks. so she will help keep your news under wraps. If you do miscarry you might want a friend to share it with .|`|UNLrYNeUaa	just admit it, why wouldn't you want to tell them?, unless it was just a one night stand and the daddy ran off and is no where to be found than hide it as long as you can, that's the only reason I can see for you to hide this from them, other then that tell them
cPMHKz4Oaa	I think your dad went a little too far with the punishment,  He should have used more self control .  Sometimes when you try and try to talk to a child and they seem not to listen, I guess you can lose it.  You are not bad, you are just a kid, It takes hard work to build a good life and be successful.  You have to do this while you are young,  because you are young only one time in your life.  If you don't make it then it is hard to go back and try when you get older.  Look around you,  see what others have done to mess up, and do you want to be in their shoes.   Do you want nice things?  a nice car a new home?  Make a good salary.  These things take work.  I've had to work for what I have no one gave it to me or died and left it to me nor did I cheat to get it or steal anything.  Work hard at school you won't be sorry.  Also I think spanking should be used only as a last resort.  Was this your case?  Good Luck|`|jvW3a5GYaa	No, I just spanked my 6th grader last night - I'm sure your parents feel the same way I do - you were raised to know better than to act like that - if you want to act like a 3 year old then you'll get punished like a 3 year old.   I agree that in middle school you shouldn't be spanked anymore (because you are old enough not to do the things that would warrant a spanking).|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	call the police?|`|ZHfvcyjXaa	I really think 6 grade to way to old for a spanking exspecially wiht your pants pulled down.But thats just me|`|kBn4UaMUaa	I think you should of been spanked, but this is a little excessive. You need to straighten up|`|CFFuFof1aa	Well, I don't think that you are too old to spank. I think that is why children get a way with what they get away with nowadays. You definitey deserved to get a spanking! I think that you didn't have any respect for your parents by putting on the IPOD while you were being disciplined. I think you should have more respect for yourself and not cheat and care about your tests and homework. Believe me, when you grow up an education is something you will need. You can't get a good job with out having an education. So please have more respect for yourself and your parents.    Now, on the other hand. I think that he was way over the line by pulling your pants down and using a brush! And he probably shouldn't have spanked you as many times as he did. Give them some time to cool down, talk to your mom about it and when your dad gets home talk to him about it. Don't be disrespectful!! Don't yell...try to talk like a grown up. You can tell him, Dad I know that I disappointed you and that I deserved to be punished, but when you did this to me....this is how I felt, and this bothered me. But you have to start acting like a grown up!!!|`|AnyO0eGLaa	Any physical abuse such as spanking or going without meals is considered child abuse and should NEVER be tolerated! Corporal punishment is child abuse, pure and simple.|`|OlaUmaUQaa	ok wow do not ever call the police for something like that i did  it once and i regret it every day of my life! im in 8th grade and ya ur too old to get spanked like pull down ur pants and stuff haah i used to get spanked with a metal cooking spoon and nor just in the butt and i get it every day !  but that stoped when i was 7|`|cvRD8J2gaa	What you did was wrong but it also was the wrong punishment spanking is more for like 3 year olds|`|bfjs9wSLaa	I think that your father just  wanted to see your bare bum.  That's pretty inapproriate, but you also did something wrong, so  you have to realize what you did is bad too, and disgraces your family.  But, you are right, you are WAY too old to be spanked w/ a bare bum!  Talk to your mom about it.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	You're not too old.  I daresay u won't cheat on a test again!  As long as he doesn't draw blood or leave bruises it's not abuse.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Sounds to me like you were asking for a spanking.     However, you should tell you Mom that him pulling your pants down made you feel uncomfortable in a way unrelated to being punished.     I do not feel it is appropriate for a father to pull his daughters pants down in any circumstance. That was wrong.|`|By2QtFigaa	aw im so sorry. i dont think thats acceptable. i think you should tell a trusted adult about this|`|0030f5e590ff16086572cdefc7f73ce4aa	?|`|wzcvFKKhaa	getting spanked is a great punishment and with a belt or paddle is even better if kids got spanked more now a days kids might start behaving when i was young i hated being spanked but now that i'm older i understand why they did it and it made me a better person because it made me understand respect and respect for my elders spanking needs to be brought back and put back in schools    plus my family the older you get the less spanking and more straight azz beatings when i was 13 i called my mom a botch and she punch me in the back of the head and after that i never did it again|`|385b5c9d7cdef8d18d881b50a9b24b0faa	you are a little too old to be spanked...  but if you didn't cheat in the first place, it wouldn't have happened.|`|s30Duwdraa	It sucks that you got spanked and I agree that you are too old.  But it sounds like your parents are frustrated with you because you pretty much do what you want and don't respect them or their rules.  Respect is a two-way street and once you learn to give it, you'll get what you want.    Now you know your dad isn't messing around when he says your getting spanked!  Do you really want to re-live that scene?      Good luck!|`|kWBXSjHXaa	He RAPED you lol|`|iSMWMhHraa	When you act like a baby you get treated like a baby. Why don't you try and grow up. Growing up is not about your age, but how mature you act. You need to study to get good grades and you need to be in school to learn. It was totally disrespectful to put your iPod in your ears when your parents were talking to you. If you were talking to them and they had done that, how would you have felt? Your parents are trying to make you be a responsible adult. Most liars and cheats end up in jail at some point. Is that what you want to be when you grow up? A loser? Your parents don't want that for you and are trying hard to teach you. You owe your parents and your teacher an apology for your behavior and then you need to change your ways.|`|7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	I think you are getting too old to be having your pants pulled down like that and spanked by your father. And using a brush is going way too far. You say this happens a few times a year. He really should not be hitting you at all and this needs to stop. Maybe tell a counselor at school about it or like the other person said a trusted adult.|`|aGLAt8tpaa	You were able to list most of the things you know you did wrong.    1) Not studying and doing work.  2) cheating on test.  3) Lying  4) Listening to your Ipod instead of listening to lecture.    If you don't want to be spanked, then behave.    Now that I've said that I do agree that you are a little old for spankings.  I would have taken away most of your privileges. No computer except for homework. No TV. No hanging with friends. Extra chores to do with your free time. Monitored study periods at home with me looking over your shoulder.

He was a boy.    wait.  His name was Omri.  But I still am not crazy about Yuri but it's better than other names so if you love it-go for it!|`|6TNOfI7faa	I actually like it. Yuri is just a nice name in general.|`|23MPcnNqaa	It's definitely something that is different!!  I'm not sure whether I like it or not.  But if you really like it and want to name your child that, that is your decision and your choice.  Don't go by what others think!!|`|GU3RauKOaa	isnt yuri japanese for girl? its nice|`|H91tVrXSaa	i really like that name.  it's more of a japanese name though but if you like it, thats okay  =)|`|DP4TH7Qzaa	Hell no!|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	not really for americans|`|SEifPqWlaa	Sorry but no...|`|AyoxEkRTaa	that sounds like a video game|`|qzZHjZSIaa	Actually Yuri is of Russian origin. Its meaning can be translated into "farmer". Do you really want to name a girl like that? I would not call a girl Yuri.    love    Simon|`|6MQwvOIUaa	It's a male name, from Russia. If you wants to be peculiar, name her Barack.  (Ok, just joking! lol )  But it is a male name.|`|AZV2ddsMaa	um...not really. its original though|`|VI7syO77aa	its a males name|`|6ca36162e3c109e0cc5c9ca79ca4b4bcaa	Yuri Gagarin was the first Russian in Space !!!|`|WapGLYvOaa	no. i know a person named yuri and they are a male
7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	As a mother of a 13 year old I agree with the disciplinary measures except the eating part.  It is against the law in this state to withhold a meal from a child.  But they're absolutely right to take away every modern convenience and privilege she has gotten past a shower and a toilet.  There would be no screaming in my house.  They need to be at school sometimes to check up on her work after school because she's probably not even doing it.|`|AA11984147	This punishment 'sounds' a little off base, but in my upbringing and from what I am witnessing in the basic attitudes of students today, I say it's necessary. The child is not being threatened. She is not going to starve and apparently she has been given many priveleges that need some instant 'taking away' in order to get her attention.  If the parents have talked, and talked and it has not helped, then taking away the bed, the covers and everything else to get her attention might be necessary to open the lines of communication seriously.      If all else fails, I say send her to a detention home where she can stay for a day or two and see how blessed she really is.  If that does not work, let her visit and stay in the juvenile for girls and watch what goes on there.      We are dealing with a new breed of young people today.  I say it's the fault of not only the parents, but the society we now live in.  There is a lack of teaching honor and responsibility and pride from the home.  Many parents uphold their children's bad behavior and it is taxing on the society, the school system, and the homes.     I have students in my class who are the "adult' at home - having to care for their sisters and brothers, make the dinner and basically run the house - they talk to their parents like they are grown, they see grown up things and do grown up things. Some of them have no father in the home, drugs and drug deals run rampant in the home and neighborhood.  I had two students who were eye witnesses to drive bys.  One student had her house shot up.  It's just the student and her mother.  They were terrified.  Then when these kids come to school, we expect them to put on the child uniform and act like a child when they don't know how to go back.  They are getting confused messages and signals.  These are 8th graders who go out on dates and have regular sex!  They flash their condoms in school, they curse their teachers and stomp their foot.  They walk out of class and they will fight teachers if necessary.  Their parents will come in and many of them act like they don't know or believe their child is acting this way.  They say - the teacher is picking on them.  They don't know they are preparing their own children for a world that will eat them alive!     So, I don't think the punishment is too hard for the crime.  Take the gifts away! This child needs to learn she is a child and has a responsibility to to the work.  When she is 18 if she wants to move out and do what she wants - they she can legally.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I would say that they are trying to get a point across to this girl and they are doing everything the correct way, except screaming at her. Screaming at her isnt' going to solve anything.     It's not like they didn't allow her to eat, they just told her she was not going to until she did her homework, which she has been slacking on... She didn't finish her homework like she should have and so she went with out dinner, they had to follow through with what they said to her or else she would just continue to walk all over them.     They are trying to be good parents here, no one wants their child to act like this.|`|iSMWMhHraa	I would allow her to eat, by herself in the kitchen. She would never have a TV in her room in my house to start with. I would also start taking her to school and walk her in to the class in front of her friends and discuss this in front of everyone to the teacher. Ask my oldest kids, I have done this. If you don't want to be embarrassed, then you will do as you are supposed to. There would be no TV, phone or internet for the rest of the quarter until grades come out and there is significant improvement. There would also be no going out except to school and church. Staying after school would be fine with me, I would even be willing to stay with her so that the teacher can go home. If she just did her work to start with, this would not even be a problem. Tell her to step it up a notch. My one daughter struggles, so she works ahead as often as she can.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	Absolutely - she brought it on her self - all she has to do is finish the work and it will be over. Bravo to her parents!!!!!|`|Vp1Wzu07aa	I am shocked that parents would withhold food as a punishment or motivation, but the rest sounds very reasonable to me. Five missing assignments would be done in a fair amount of time.|`|6rcRZUnSaa	Yes, this  is  good  punishment  for  her  except  food  part. I  think  it  was  too  much, but  other  things  were  good  and  she  should  understand  her  fault  and  she  won't  do  it  again  in  the  future.|`|WpR6QLHtaa	well the not eating i do not think thats right I mean everyone needs to eat..however i do not have a 13 yr old but my husband always says grounding doesnt do any good the kids just get use to not having the item that you have taking away from them but however he beliefs in loooooong lectures which me myself cant stand and he has been known to go to school with our child before and i mean to every class...if the child gets into alot of trouble they may wanna try making her voklunteer at like the animal shelter on weekends and stuff like that i dont know if this helps bnut thats oue experience with grounding but NEVER have we made ours go without food that crazy
P9HuD4Qgaa	He cares because you are carrying apart of him, inside you. you're the mother of his seed, a wonderful thing, and you have to make that baby, so he wants to make sure both you are ok. If you're Ok, that means his seed is o.K. And He loves you more, now that ur pregnant.|`|AA11206135	If you're old enough to be having a baby, you're old enough not to use idiotic terms like "baby daddy"    ah well at least you didn't say you were "preggers"or "prego"|`|jk6ayFUmaa	well he could understand that you are emotional and all that from being pregnant and i would say he really cares if he isnt getting mad at you for being mean to him|`|x3vnPezTaa	I would have to say he cares about you and the baby. From the sounds of it he isnt just calling to see how the baby is doing so that would say to me that he cares about the both of you. But seriously, i would have to agree with a couple others, grow up a little and accept the fact that he is there for you. ALOT of guys run when they hear they got someone pregnant. Be thankful and stop worrying so much!|`|ozmRtpMyaa	what the hell is a baby daddy?|`|BkVMXkgSaa	whaaa?|`|i8Ch743Laa	If you're using the term "baby daddy" I'm not sure. You seem really really young. It could be that he loves you,and is sticking it out through the good times and the bad. Stop being paranoid,and embrace this. It's not often a baby's dad actually sticks around,especially being there through the good times and the bad. I know this,as my now husband and I had our daughter when I was sixteen,and I am now 22,married to him,and pregnant with our second child,so it does indeed happen. He was the same way,so I most definately wish you the best!!|`|vSHkZWUoaa	just the baby
PLK1p8cUaa	If you just had your period you are probably not pregnant.  Take a test in about a week if it is negative but you are concerned it wasn't a "normal" period for you.  Until then use condoms.  See a doctor.  Good luck.|`|iXMuNCpBaa	One of my best friends just had a baby.  She was on the pill when she conceived.  There is a reason why they say abstinence is the best form of birth control.|`|3CG3rby0aa	possibility but not likely cause it lasts a little longer in your system than that.

xV0APOtaaa	Assuming she delivered on her due date. November 28-7days=November 21 + 3 months =February 21 (conception date). But if she was early dates are going to be different. I would still ask for a test just for your solid peace of mind.    I applaude you though. You don't know if it's yours and you're willing to take responsibility. My ex knows for sure and he isn't around for our daughter.    GOOD LUCK|`|hmKEHofzaa	There is a GOOD possibility.  I would get a test for sure

145RUNQHaa	Hi.i do feel for you as i believe you are trying your best.i also feel for your son i think he needs to feel you are both on the same side.yes i know you are in charge but sometimes with children of this age things can easily turn into a battle of wills that is what i think the problem is here.i m sorry you felt the need to spank him you must have been very frustrated to do that and you must have felt guilty afterwards but please don t resort to that again.your son is not there to be fought with he is there to be taught and you and his dad will ALWAYS be his best teachers.never let him see you lose your cool or at least aim for that.set him a good example always act how you want him to act this will teach him a lot you ll notice how much when he gets older.let him help with whatever tasks you are doing it doesn t matter if he doesn t get it right and maybe he will hinder you it will make him feel important if you praise him and thank him his help made all the difference.he will feel part of a team your family unit should be.don t fight with him to brush his teeth all children need motivating to do these boring jobs.get him a musical tooth brush my daughter has one that plays high school musical she now loves cleaning her teeth or make a game of it.when he s getting dressed set a time limit even go as far as putting an egg timer out and if he beats the clock cheer and clap or give him a sticker to say well done.you need to turn things like that into a positive experience that way he s more likely to get on with things.yes it is hard work and takes time and patience but that s what being a parent is all about.a time out may be called for at times but not too often or it will lose it s effect.explain calmy and clearly what he did wrong sit him at the table for a few minutes then go back and clearly explain what you expect from him in the future and reward him if he follows through next time.it will get better just don t be on his case all the time.all the best to you all. X|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Parenting small children is not a battle, contest, or even a fair fight.    You have way too many advantages for it to be any of those things.  You have more experience, knowledge, size, strength and most of all a much better ability to build a mental model of his mind inside yours.  Every interaction should be based on using all these advantages and strengths to change his surroundings (and, yes, you are part of those surroundings) to alter what he thinks and what he does.  If he surprises you, either positively or negatively, this means that your model of him needs work.  Keeping that model up to date, so you determine what he is learning and becoming is one of your most important jobs as parent.  Right up there with feeding and protecting.    So... instead of keeping score on what instructions he is not following, try to put your self inside his mind (building your model) and try to think of ways to help him want to do what you have been commanding, without you commanding.  I'm sorry that I can't be very specific about this, because my model of the mind of every child I have helped raise (I'm the second of eight children, and father of two) has been very unique.   Each was motivated by almost completely different things, with the exception of a need for love, respect and appreciation.    You say he won't listen to you, but do you give him an example of what it is like to be listened to the way you would prefer?  Or do you project frustrated power and expect him to act differently than you act in front of him?   Think about it.  You are the one of the two important examples he uses to learn how to be human.  You don't have to think like him (after all, his model of your mind is a lot more rudimentary than your model of his mind is), but you need to show him, by your example, how he should act.  This should be something you should always conscious of, if you are to have any hope of getting him where you want him to arrive.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|Q87djE0laa	well if you find the answer let me know coz my son is exactly the same i say his name 4 times before he say WHAT!! no hes not deaf|`|eHow24rNaa	I can totally understand what you mean. My daughter turned 4 in October and she doesnt listen to me or her dad. But when she goes spend the nights with her grandparents shes an angel. Ive tried everything from spanking and taking things away. The only thing i can tell you that kind of works is keep on telling them what to do and they'll get the picture that your not messing around and you mean business. Like right now, im trying to get my daughter to clean her room up and put the toys away in her toy chest...shes crying and screaming at me at this very second. I just keep telling her shes not watching tv or playing til its all cleaned. She'll get the picture im sure...just keep telling your child what to do and he'll catch on like my daughter will....good luck...i know its rough...trust me...haha!!|`|WysaCRukaa	I feel your pain!! I have a daughter who is almost four and a son almost 7 AND am a preschool teacher for 3-5 yr olds. Whew! They are a tough crowd! Not all children respond to the same discipline methods or styles but you might try a reward/responsibility chart. That would be a calender you stick on the fridge with expected behaviors(like listening) and light age appropriate "chores"(like picking up his toys or putting dirty clothes in a laundry basket) And a reward at the end of the week. Each day he gets a sticker on the calender to mark his progress. As the week goes by you can remind him when his behavior is getting out of line of the choice HE is making if it continues. I would say something like "oh, I hope you decide to start listening because I was really looking forward to our ice cream date this friday!"   Some kids do much better when they feel they are in control, that they are being good because they want to not because they have to.   The only other thing I can tell you is it does usually get much better after the 3yr mark.You sound like a dedicated mom, and I am sure you will find something that works! Keep looking :)
WrEXhthvaa	next time wear a condom|`|QP8LdPLeaa	you sound very immature!!! gosh i can't stand this!!    "i told her abortion os what seemed right in my mind as were both still kids in high school etc etc."    if you REALLY believed that you both were just kids in high school then why the heck did you engaged in such stupid action and have sex with the girl? sex is NOT for kids. even if she was on birth control that doesn't mean she couldn't get pregnant, birth Control only REDUCES the chance of becoming pregnant, that's all it does! sex makes babies! what is sooooooo hard about teenagers not getting that through their heads.    about abortion, in my opinion  that's always been the easy way out, instead of THINKING and using your head, you want the baby to take responsibility for your actions, wow some father you are, you already want your own flesh and blood to die because of your actions. you did the deed, now step up!!    however, she said she needed nothing from you, so why are you so concerned? she wont talk to you, she keeps ignoring you, so basically your your free, oh lucky you!  i believe she tricked you into getting pregnant because something just doesn't seem right.    next time, have sex when youre ready to have a baby, if not, keep your pants zipped, stay in school and THINK next time.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	While having sex with her was not good, to me, her attitude stinks to high heaven.    While she may have family to support her n' the baby, the fact of her pushing you out of the baby's life is so typical.    A guy get's a girl pregnant.  If the guy/father doesn't care to be involved, the girl/mother whines n' complains that the guy/father is not being supportive.  If the guy/father wants to be involved, he gets shut out of the baby's life, with the claim that, she can do it without his help.    Do not forget about going to college.  But, You should also get some sort of job, for the sole purpose of supporting the baby.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	abstinence, my friend.    She says she doesnt need your help, well shes wrong. She'll realize she NEEDS your help eventually, and you'll find no way around that.    You go yourself into this mess, not you need to take responsibility.     Yes, you got into college, but because you had unprotected sex, you now need to sort your priorities.    You cant run away from the fact that youre a father.|`|F7tyzrMzaa	OK, you cannot just tell a girl to have an abortion. It's wrong. If she doesn't want one, she's not going to have one. And you need to take responsibility for this child. You didn't wear a condom. You should have asked before hand if she was on birth control, but you still should have used a condom.    And if you're not ready for a kid yet, why are you having sex? No contraceptions is 100% perfect, you should know that. This child needs to know it's father. It didn't ask to be born, but it's gonna be, and that's half your fault.    Please, step up, and be a man. It doesn't matter if the girl doesn't want you involved, you have a right and responsibility as a father.  Don't let you little girl or boy grow up without a dad.    EDIT: No, don't give up your plans of an education. If her parents are willing to support her for now, let them, and get your qualifications. When you've got them, get a good job and then you'll be able to support him or her. But that doesn't mean you can get away with it until then. Be there for your child. Being there for it doesn't mean you have to pay for everything. Do what you can.|`|AA11742929	You should ALWAYS use protection,especially if you're not ready to be a parent. BUT I think she should be more mature and let you at least be there to support her if she is in fact pregnant. She should have had a pregnancy test by now,make sure you know it for a fact. Don't give up your goals,that will bite you in the butt later. You can still pursue your dreams with a child,and if she or you do not want you in this child's life, then you can sign off parental rights through the courts.I don't think abortion is right,but that's just my opinion. If she is capable of raising a child,then she can take the responsibility. Keep your goals number one. it can only make your future more  stable, and if you gave that up, you would regret it later.   Good luck, I wish you the best.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Not everybody who is a teen parent quits school. I didnt|`|6pSRrYQhaa	well you wouldn't want to be a 'stereotypical' father, who doesn't father his child, but continuing your education is the best path to be on...    keep calling her and try and talk things through. let her know how you feel and your say and look at the situation through her eyes and understand her point as well...    good luck.. hope you make the best decision, whatever you do.. stay in school!|`|6kZl8a39aa	it seems like she tried to get pregnant on purpose unfortunately you were the one she wanted the seed from.we'll theirs not much u can do either way shes going to keep the baby it was her plan the whole time good luck.
FUNhlpiqaa	Just out of curiosity, how are you going to get a judge to consider your "special situation" without cluing him in on the pervert who got you pregnant?    Maybe you should find out if you really are pregnant and then worry about the consequences.    By the way, depending what state you live in, 16 may be of legal age to consent to sex... as for the last two years your were dating this guy... jail bait.|`|AFIYLZzpaa	I don't think the judge will   your going to have to have parental consent :\    If your high school has a counselor ask them about a clinic that provides free abortions for teenagers, or call a hotline and ask for advice.  Their the pro's and they can offer you advice on what to do :) like what your next step is.|`|ud8jzRdNaa	i think this website should tell you what you need to know feministing.com hope i helped and good luck|`|AA10145416	just a thought: you can gve the baby up for adoption, i think your son/daughter's life it is more important than anything else, remember they start out as a cell that keeps multiplying meaning its already a life|`|JHqFSmFyaa	Wow you are stupid he deserves to I to jail he's 7 years older than you!!!|`|3WFac9xaaa	Yup hell be introuble ither way. Judge or having the baby your so in tough sh!t anyway....  Maybe you shouldnt be having sex at 16 with a grown man if you arent ready for the responsibilities that come along with sex. should of thought about this before hand sweetie.   I cant wait til you grow up and realize how stupid this sounds =]    Go to the judge so your bf can go to jail, thats what i think will be best      HOPE I HELPED|`|ml6GSjqXaa	Your boyfriend is going to be in trouble if you go to a judge.  You need to tell your parents.

86oPkfzOaa	I agree with Daddy@ -"Wow, you're stupid."    I'd like to see a picture of you, if you think so much about being ugly and pretty. I will star this question and see if you post a picture. And, quite honestly, you can't talk, since you are probably as ugly as it can get. And, I'm not talking about looks. You might be absolutely beautiful, it's your personality that's so horrible and ugly.|`|IKfzh78Daa	Wow, you're stupid.|`|bZBByJAAaa	So you think people deserve more or less based on their looks? Well, I think you deserve the worst because you're as ugly as it can get. You're ugly on the inside which can't be fixed. At least that girl can have a plastic surgery and change her looks but the type of ugliness you have is unrepairable.|`|8OoqHpbIaa	i agree with jen you shouldn't judge people like that    im sure that girl is hot to somebody and the they is ugly to somebody    Beauty is in the eye of the beholder|`|5D0KuT74aa	you have no idea on how genetics work  and im not gonna waste my time explaining it to someone so shallow and selfcentered as you    oh and, btw  your avatars ugly|`|sjUNb9zXaa	Well from the look of your avatar, you look like a dog. Can anybody say Ruff,Ruff *****!!!!|`|AA11349925	Hot kids??? do you realise how sick that sounds?  girl, you ugly inside and out so you can't say sh!t.|`|492180924fe32381f3e8cd7774074fe9aa	gotta watch what you say because it can come back and bite you in the butt.. if your kids come out ugly, what are you gonna do, feed em 2 the crocodiles ~|`|DXLfxoTNaa	Hey guys don't be so mean to her. Her parents obviously taught her that she is only worth something if she is pretty.  She definitely has more problems then whether or not people are attractive.  Parents just need to love and teach love.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I would be curious to see how perfect you look.  I'd rather be the girl at school who got the "ugly genes,"  than the girl on the internet who got the shallow ones.  Eventually you will hopefully grow up and figure out what's important in life.  This is not one of those things.|`|12xQlgr7aa	That's a terrible thing to say to someones face.|`|AA11436002	you're an idiot|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Even a teenager knows that calling someone ugly like that is insensitive and unacceptable. Your age has nothing to do with this; you will never grow out of being a cruel person with no respect for others. It is a shame that your parents have not raised you to know better.|`|Z1atdG4kaa	Ok If I was a lesbian I would totaly take the ugly girl over you. Someone who is hott and has a pissy attitude like you looks 10 times more ugly to other people than the "ugly girl". GROW THE F*** UP! Seriousely OMG how can someone be so blackhearted?|`|vIeqLcFmaa	That's a horrible thing to say and you're obviously not very smart. There's no such thing as ugly genes, people look different even brothers and sisters.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I remember girls like you back  when I was in school... they are all 300lbs and live in trailer parks now...|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Terrible to say this.|`|AA10025824	That's as shallow as it gets.  In the end the "Ugly" one will win anyway.  When you grow up and look back at all the "Hot" ones that turned into dogs you'll see what I mean.  What's on the inside comes out.|`|GtxnGKoAaa	All children are beautiful. It's people like you who are ugly, both in mind, spirit, and body!|`|r18PoGJiaa	Anyone tell you that you are a rude *****?   No?  Well you are.|`|838VJJGvaa	Quit judging people by their looks and maybe you will have good looking kids.
RQc8fbjbaa	I lost my mucus plug 10 days before giving birth with my second. For my first daughter I lost it while I was in labor. Each pregnancy, labor and delivery is unique. This could mean you are very close or it could be a couple weeks. I know the last month seems to go by so fast but you will have your baby very soon! Good Luck!|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i lost my plug it was all clear and went into labor about an hour later|`|QM6wiVtVaa	I lost my mucus plug 4 days ago (pink, not clear) and am still very pregnant.|`|Wc3Vge9taa	i lost my mucus plug and went in to labor almost two weeks later (a day pass my due date)|`|IOU6zo9Raa	I lost it at the very beginning of labor. It is usually a sign that labor is beginning. I don't understand why she couldn't reach your cervix. That is hard to believe. Not reaching your cervix? How does she know your effacing? Your probably at the beginning of labor, even if your not very dilated.  Are you having contractions? You probably will soon.|`|X6as2nOAaa	I lost my mucuc plug about a week in a 1/2 before I had the baby. You will know when you are in labor it hurts good luck though it doesn't sound like too much longer.
690279cb7caa51056d2e306c73dae94faa	Breastfeeding questions and because I feel like I could help others who are having trouble with it.  I've read a lot of breastfeeding books and did more research online.  I like to help out with a mom who wants to breastfeed but is having trouble.  I want to encourage breastfeeding as much as possible.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Because I ended up being a formula-feeding mom when I didn't intent to be one, I was really at a loss about bottles and formula feeding and pumping etc. when I first got home from the hospital.  I did a lot of research and asked my pediatrician a lot of questions so I like to pass on rational, medically supported information about formula feeding when those questions come up.|`|X6as2nOAaa	baby questions|`|DNygQdmVaa	baby questions because i have  a 13month old.  and ttc questions because I am too.|`|b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Helping out people in need of a little compassion. Often people need a little reassurance, for example, that they are doing the right thing. This hits me close to home because some of us don't have a mom or dad or grandma or girlfriend with kids to ask this stuff.     I am also a junkie for questions that are a little odd or very interesting. (Not troll questions, but legitimate ones.) I like questions that make me think, or that I had never considered. They make me want to think or do research until I know the answer, then I share that knowledge or perspective.     Also passing on general knowledge when I have it :) I am also passionate about asking questions in this section, because I find most answers extremely helpful. They are from real moms who have "been there." People who really want to help, who have no agenda.|`|lGcpXteaaa	If i see a teenage mother question i am likely to jump in there, most likely it is a question from some ignorant woman challenging teen mothers.  The reason is that i am a well off teen mother at 18 and SICK of people on here treating me as one of the silly girls who had sex at a party...I like to prove them wrong about their so called 'facts and statistics'     I like to answer questions where women need help on breastfeeding. I got well educated on the matter and was successful with breastfeeding. I know that some people weren't so lucky and couldn't get the hang of it.   So the thought that i might have helped somebody to be able to breastfeed makes me happy.  Same goes for bedtime routines and methods.    I stay clear of the abortion questions. Because they actually ruin my day!|`|5f6XnInEaa	Because this is really the only opportunity I get to socialize with other mummies....after being home with the bub all day!    I look tp answer the troll questions...or I try to defend people when others are giving them, a hard time, in relation to formula feeding...pacifiers etc.  For some reason, a lot of people like to make up statistics on here, to support there so-called argument, (i.e I read that 99.7% of women can breastfeed...which is blatant rubbish, because the real statistic is 22%, according to the Aus BNA)    But when I see the "I dont want a job...can I use Welfare instead" questions ,   I go nuts. I look for those questions too.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	breastfeeding, vaccination and sick babies.  Why - because I am a lactation counselor and a pediatric nurse
b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	Haha. I'm having quite the mental picture...    Well, pushing the head out is not easy at all, and takes some time and a lot of pain, so there is warning. It is true, though, that once the head's out, the body kind of "falls" or shoots out as you say (not like a cannon though) and you have to literally get ready to catch the baby in many cases! That's because a newborn's head is much bigger than the rest of the body, so once the way is clear, the slippery baby has no resistance and it's easy sailing. :) So if you're ever in that position, be ready to grab on tight!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I can tell it is Saturday!!!    Do you have to push to poop? Yes! It doesnt just fall out or shoot out of you. Same with babies.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	Labor= hard work!!  they don't just shoot out... If they did it wouldn't be the most painful and hard thing a woman will ever do!  Even with a C-section there is a lot of tugging and pulling to get the baby out!  Haven't you ever seen a "baby Story"??
8zdPI8Qsaa	Ugh, the glucose drink. I cried all the way through it, and I didn't even finish it in the 10 minutes allotted (the nurse yelled at me the whole time while I did everything in my power not to vomit in the middle of the doctors office. Anywho, I ate beforehand... or else I would've died. Just nothing with sugar, so I had plain eggs and a piece of sugarless whole wheat toast. At least the test is early and you can get your sugar fix afterwards! Good luck.|`|AA10161551	aww...my baby's name is Gracie! I love that name? ugh the dreded glucose test.....c] :|`|pXSKSS3daa	I was just told not to eat anything too high in sugars/salt, that's all.    To be sure though, call up your OB's office. Some places have different "rules" when it comes to this.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This is the diabetes test.  You're not supposed to eat anything before it, it's a real bummer.  They want you not to have any sugar in your system, they measure your blood sugar to get a baseline, then give you the sugary drink and wait an hour and measure your blood sugar again.    I thought they specifically tried to schedule these appointments in the morning!  It's so cruel to make a pregnant woman go without food.  Mine was around 11AM and I was totally lightheaded by the time it was over.|`|SIhEme03aa	I wish I wouldn't have eaten before because I failed the glucose test by like 4 points and then had to take the four hour test. My test was right away in the morning though. You should definitely eat since your test isnt until 1. Try to eat light and avoid sugar! Good luck!|`|vjsT8DMIaa	technically you're not supposed to eat or drink anything but water past midnight the night before. And after you drink the drink...you're not supposed to eat until they draw your blood 1 hour after.  I know, it sucks!! Been there, done that!! LOL I had to do the 3 hour test because I ended up having gestational diabetes...NOT FUN!! Good luck and congrats on your pregnancy! :)    HOWEVER, I would call your MD to make sure. I had 2 of my children by one midwife...and I was allowed to eat...and with my 3rd was supposed to fast, even for the 1 hour test. Each office is different|`|MQ34YW28aa	my doctor said i could eat anything and drink anything before the appointment once i got there i couldn't have anything. well i didn't fall into that trap of theirs with eating 'anything and drink anything' i just made sure i drank water and didn't eat anything that had lots of sugar in it. I was seeing doctors in georgia and i didn't care for them. I felt like it was their way of me being positive for that gestational diabetes. so that way it's more money for them because i would have to come in and do more testing. i don't think so!!! lol. moved to minnesota and their doctors are soo much better. always have been (born here) anyways yes it's fun having your baby hiccup in you, it's a different feeling but it's so cute watching your tummy do little jumps too. My son is 9 weeks tomorrow and he sure still has those hiccups. and he hates them, lol.|`|nCKdkYSyaa	From what I remember i had a 2pm appt and they said i could eat before i came in just not anything sugary, example: i could eat eggs and toast and milk and water, just nothing like a poptart or doughnuts! LOL and Goodluck! I had a really bad vomiiting issue when i was prego with my daughter i threw up everyday from 4 weeks to 40weeks they tried to get me to drink the orange drink (my doctor also had fruit punch flavor also but i was feeling that) and i threw it up 3 times and finally said dont you guys get it its NOT going to stay down its disgusting LOL so my baby won and they just pricked my finger every other visit to check that way. even though my daughter is 14 months i remember this part of pregnancy very clearly! it was NOT FUN lol|`|vewYW4wcaa	I loved when my baby hiccuped when i was pregnant! made my whole belly jiggle, it was pretty darn cute.|`|pVEuJiLkaa	I just had the oarnge drink last week... I was told to have a simple breakfast without sugars added before I went in... I had a little bit of oatmeal plain and a hard boiled egg...
Rzwrz6vdaa	Y!A has been removing baby name games "questions" because they're not questions, they're games... and that violates the terms and conditions    and whomever game me a thumbs down, sorry I guess you have trouble accepting the truth??|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	i dont like them at all.  They are way to long and if I wanted to play a game I would go to yahoo games|`|wdXQaATDaa	idk but i love playing them!     =)|`|RaDJT5HLaa	what is a baby name game?|`|dEGUFVTqaa	LOVE THEM!
k8pFvtMLaa	Camden & Etta are okay.  I don't like Kahlan at all.  Thomas & Quinn are boy names. Especially Thomas. It's not even remotely close to being a unisex name, let alone a girls name...  I could see Quinn on a girl more than Thomas. But I still like it better on a boy.    Alfresco, Story, Aexis (I don't even know how to say it) & Deyta I don't like at all.|`|DdjpQr0Gaa	I like Camden, and Kahlan alot and Etta and Quinn are not bad but I can't imagine Thomas being used for a girl ever  The other things listed at the bottom there are not names.  They sound far worse than anything you have listed at the top !|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I actually LOVE Quinn, but not so much the others. And I wouldn't agree with the other's you listed for "other people's choices".|`|9iXGakohaa	Because everyone has their own tastes. Just like you don't like a lot of people's choices, they don't like yours, it's just personal preference. I think Quinn is a really cute name :)|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Camden is masculine, not that I would call a boy it either though.    Kahlan sounds and looks ridiculous    Thomas.....is definitely masculine, check every single baby names book around and you'll see this.    Etta isn't unique, there are many old ladies with the name.    Quinn is a surname not a first name for either gender.    Alfresco sounds ridiculous    Story is what is in a book, not a name    Aexis I couldn't even pronounce    Deyta sounds like computer DATA.|`|xqPRS6Buaa	i really like camden and quinn.  i like etta and kahlan too, very unique. not so sure about thomas though.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I don't like your second set of names that you say some people agree with.  Some people will agree with or to anything.  Doesn't make it right or wrong for that matter.  For your choices I like Camden and Quinn.  Thomas is a boy's name and if you wish to name a girl like that I would go w/Tommi (with an i).|`|bVJ0B7tXaa	everyone has there own opinions, i don't really like any of those names.  Etta might be cute tho.|`|ysg91Iziaa	everyone does have their own opinion, five years ago when i named my son Jaidyn i got "the look" several times when telling them what i was naming my baby, now it is really common. we are having a girl in may and we already get the same, her name will be Laiklyn Breea. you will always get the look but we can't all be John's and Dorothy's!|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	My friend has a cousin named Camden and everyone seems to think it is a cute name.  Some names just might not sound right to some people. I personally think Camden and Kahlan are cute names.|`|pOekC2Sqaa	Camden is okay just a bit masculine sounding in a way, but Cammy is an adorable nickname.     Kahlan is alright but no my style.    Thomas is a boys name IMO. How about use the feminine version which is Thomae.     Etta is very pretty, but I think maybe use it as a nickname for names such as Henrietta (just a suggestion)    Quinn - I HATE THIS NAME! Sorry, but I can't stand it.     Tbh, everyone has their own opnions on whether they like the name or not. Don't be put down by what others feel - if you like it, then that's all that matters. As you can see from what I've said about the names you put down as examples, they range from love, like and hate. It's my opinon - end of story.     G2B|`|87WOSjwgaa	I dont like them because you are having a girl not a boy. Pick a girls name!! The poor thing her whole life everyone will think she is a boy when they hear her name. I dont like the other names that you posted either|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Well Camden sounds really trendy, Kahlan is a fictional character from the fantasy series The Sword of Truth by Terry Goodkind, so by naming  your daughter from a sissy book sounds kinda retarded. Kahlan in my opinion sounds like a masculine foreign name.  Then it's pretty obvious why people wouldn't like Thomas for a girl, because Thomas is a very masculine boy's name. Not only that but she's going to be made fun of for like the rest of her life. Really who is going to take a grown women seriously named Thomas?  Quinn is a boy's names, it's pretty awful name for a girl, no further discussion about the name.  Etta is a very old fashion named, it was very popular in the 1880's. But today the name is more suited for a very old women or someone who has been put in the grave a long time ago.    The other names that you just listed are retarded, but I've never heard anyone use the. Thank God....|`|52VDjbNTaa	Camden's cute.  Kahlan isn't.  Tomas isn't.  Etta is.  Quinn isn't.    Alfresco is ok.  Story's nice.  Aexis is weird.  As is Deyta.
lIGbQI16aa	I like them.  Vanessa-Michelle is adorable.|`|2mA5SuPtaa	I like the name Jasmine|`|bVJ0B7tXaa	i like AKIRA! |`|jC1Mdsefaa	I like these ones:    kasia  autumn rose  akira  jasmine  adrianna  alija  -  I like it because it reminds me of elijah!|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I don't like any of them except for Vanessa, Autumn, and Adrianna. Reason being is because u hyphenated the names so it looks like 2 first names, which is a little odd. If you make the second names like Michelle, Rose, and Marie the middle names they would all b perfect names.|`|rCpU4xkBaa	I really like that they are hyphenated names because it makes them more individual, and very unique. This means that there probably wont be anyone else with these names, which is always nice!     Vanessa-Michelle, i think it could be a bit of a mouth full to say but if you can say it easily then thats what matters!    Kasia-Ola, this ones really cute. I think Ola makes a really nice second name because it flows with most names     Zuzia, ive never heard of this before! Its a really cute name though and very individual. Why not try Zuzua-Ola, i think thats cute :)    Maja-Kai, i love the name Kai, but im not so sure on Maja. If you like it though, then thats what matters!    Autumn-Rose, this is my FAVOURITE. Its so so so cute!! I love it!    The rest of them are all nice, but i prefer some of the ones i mentioned up there!    Good luck with choosing a name, youve narrowed it down to some very good choices, i wouldnt like to be the one making the final decision!! haha, my favourite though is definatley Autumn-Rose!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Adrianna-Marie - great    the rest not my style|`|ej51eWO7aa	jasmine|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	I like     Vanessa   Autumn Rose  Jasmine  Adrianna Marie (without the -)    As for    Kasia-Ola  Zuzia  Maja-Kai  Akira  Alija    I have no idea how to pronounce them|`|Aj2iJZXJaa	I don't like hyphenated names    I like     Vanessa  Rose  Marie  Adrianna    I love    Autumn and Mihcelle|`|XVMrmP2Vaa	I like Adrianna Marie. Personally I don't mean to be rude but I would make Autumn middle name because when the child goes to school you have to think of what other kids would say|`|xqPRS6Buaa	Adrianna Marie sounds adorable :)
claW4UUcaa	i had a doctors apt on july 6th at eleven i wasn't dilated or having any signs of labor {my due date was july 10th} i went to have lunch with my hubby for an hour. walked around the store buying last minute baby items and by midnight i was dilated to a three. with my second i had no signs either.|`|YdmMWziAaa	No, with both my boys it didn't start to dialate until 38 or so weeks.    I'm 36 weeks with twins now and am 60% effaced but it's only because it's twins and they will probably be getting here sooner [let's hope].|`|wBpennsMaa	I am 36 weeks pregnant and mine isn't dilated or effaced at all yet, but I'm glad because I want her to be in there for about four more days for sure to make sure she is healthy. But after at that point I will be all for it! I still haven't experienced dropping/settling :-( Hopefully that happens in the next week or so otherwise I shall be looking forward to getting induced no later than 39 weeks pregnant.|`|Ohsqy2xoaa	I am 39 wks now and still my cervix is not open.  Don't worry, pre-dilation doesnt mean anything.  I was dilated to 2 from about 36 with my first son and had to be induced at 42 wks!! As long as the baby is in position and head down you are good to go.|`|AiUCeifEaa	No my cervix was still tightly shut at 36 weeks. It has started to efface a little but no dilation. I am now 38 weeks and I get checked again on Monday. Hopefully there is some progress!!    Good luck!|`|LiiAhWYEaa	You will be fine no need to worry. Mine was dialated but that doesnt mean it has to be. They will give you medication if you dont progress.|`|iwtetdBoaa	IM 2 CM  37 WEEKS, EVERYONE IS DIF   URS WILL OPEN SOON :) GOODLUCK :) GOD BLESS
DPMsgxHMaa	Check your local fabric store like maybe a JoAnn's or whatever is close to you.  They will probably have pre-made maternity panels that you can sew into your pants or skirts.  By the time you purchase the fabric and the elastic (yes you need both), the pre-made panels are not any more expensive.  If you need one in a color they don't have, buy one and then you will be able to tell what fabric they used and how they put the elastic in.|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	I made it through 4 pregnancies with only 4 pairs of maternity pants.  I would seriously just go to target and get some of the cheaper ones.  Old Navy also has some cute stuff.  I just used the band thingy or wore the same pants over and over.  Its not like you are going to be wearing them that long.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I do this all the time as maternity clothes are so expensive.  With the pants, put them on and pull them up.  Discover where on your belly is most comfortable to have them stop and the stretchy start, then mark them, (pin or marker will due).  As for the stretchy material, you can either go get lycra at the fabric store or you can cut up an old bathing suit or a stretchy top.  You can even go to a thrift store and get stretchy tops, bathing suits or other maternity pants and just reuse what was on them.  Then measure your belly and the material (make sure to make allowance for how much further you have to go) and cut the pants at the marked point and sew on your new belly pouch.  Some prefer a definite elastic topper and some allow for more elastic and sew a button at the side so that you can attach the elastic to it and adjust for growth|`|JnLoHaoAaa	I would suggest temporarily fixing your parents rather than cutting and such. First there are stretchy bands called Bella bands that you can put over your open button and keep your pants on. Another thing you can do is leave the button open and loop a hairband around it, string it through the hole, and loop back onto the button.|`|G4qP2gATaa	Before you go cutting your pants to make them into maternity pants, why don't you look into a bella band? You just put it over your regular pants and it holds them up and such when you get too big that you cant button them.
eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Orajel makes a special tooth and gum cleanser for babies. This is what I use and it works great. Jacob loves it.|`|AA11598520	Yes, you can or you can just wipe them, and the gums, with a damp wash cloth. Start as soon as possible! I waited and it was hard to get my son to even let us start brushing his teeth.|`|fHjSonssaa	We use F1rst Teeth (the 1 is supposed to be there instead of an i) brand baby toothpaste.  We put a small drop of it on a soft finger brush (ours came with the toothpaste).  It's all natural.  Apple-Banana flavor.  It has calcium and protective enzymes- it's safe to swallow.  And our son LOVES to have his teeth brushed with it.  We've been brushing them since he was about 5 months old- he's now 10 months and we have just purchased his first baby toothbrush- and we are going to continue to use this toothpaste.  He has 6 teeth so far.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	I have to tell you with my first I used to just wipe her teeth down with a wash cloth and she hates to brush her teeth. This last time with my son (2 now) I used a real kids toothbrush and baby toothpaste and he LOVES to brush his teeth. He even does a better job then his 5 year old sister (of course I still check them both after they brush). I say go for the brush. It gets him used to something that he will have to do for the rest of his life.|`|8wnvhBQTaa	Yes I brush my twins teeth I use a really soft brush with a tiny smear of a toothpaste containing at least 1000ppm of fluoride.  The advise was given to me by my health visitor.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	At this age I would just wipe them down. After he turns one then you can think about using non-fluoride toothpaste. it's called training toothpaste.|`|IOU6zo9Raa	I would use the infants toothbrush, and wipe them off with a cloth or buy the finger toothbrush that you slip on your finger to brush each side of them. It's a good habit to get into early, trust me.|`|FcHplZtQaa	I use Milk Teeth toothpaste and a baby toothbrush, the best way to brush a babies teeth is to sit behind them with them on your knee and brush that way!
6gthdHpnaa	Guys are confusing. He may have said he liked you, and he probably does, but he probably didn't act like it around other people because he wanted to look "cool" in front of his friends. Talk to him when he is not around them, that way he will be more willing to say how he truly feels.   There is nothing wrong with a girl asking a guy out. It is not desperate. If people at your school think it is, then they're sexist. If you want him for your boyfriend, you may have to make the first move.|`|NjDYAEbHaa	theres no way to get him to ask you out  if you want him your going to have to go after him, some guys think its hot.  Ive been asked out and asked girls out. its the 21st century go get you man haha!  ask him to like a movie, thats always nice starter at a young age, and ask him out after.|`|8vL3Igzjaa	he could just be felling realy shy around you and doesnt have the courage to ask you out. just be realy friendly and hell feel more comfortable around you. also there ent much point in saying i dont want people to think im desperate, and not being happy. when you could just bite the bullet and ask him out and get what you want. whats the worst that could happen? believe me whatever u decide, within about 2 days every1 at ur school will find somin new to be interested in and wont care if u asked a boy out.|`|HOdblqIkaa	just be yourself around him dont change who you are guys are hard to read and its not any fun trying to figure them out. sooner or later hell come around he might just be nervous and doesnt know what to say or do around you it could be the first time hes done something like this. dont think too much about his actions and just go about your day like you would normally eventually hell come around
L6oSDA5Yaa	Awww im sorry about your lose. he/she is very cute. I have heard that yes you should stay away from kitty litter. Like the pee and poo becuase it can make the baby sick or unhealthy. I think you just cant clean the kitty litter but i would ask your doctor to make sure. good luck|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	so sorry for your lost you could have a miscarriage from the cat litter box the cat boo so if I was you don't get one until you have the baby good luck|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	You can have a cat, but you have to be very careful.  You can not change the litter box and you have to be really careful not to get scratched by the cats paws.  Cat Feces carries a bacteria that causes toxoplasmosis that can cause birth defects and can also cause miscarriages.  If the cat poohs in the litter box and steps in it, it can get the feces in his claws.  I would recommend not taking it unless you have someone else who can change the litter box regularly.
78FXygtoaa	no i dont think it does.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	No, it doesn't matter. Some babies are active while others are lazy. There are old wives tales saying one gender is more active then the other but in reality it just depends on the baby! :)|`|PFO1jxZGaa	No, some babies are active and some dont it has nothing to do with the babys gender. All mine were pretty avctive and I have 2 boys and a girl. I didnt notice any difference in their behavior and their sex
A1S5KNUkaa	To be honest with you I feel the same thing but I'm pretty sure it's not the babys heartbeat.  There is a lot of blood being routed through to your stomach which will cause pulsing and I can also feel a pulse in one of my finger tips (whenever I feel the pulsing in my stomach I lift the finger and it stops).  I do feel little jabs every now and again though and have traced the outline of my baby through my stomach which was amazing!  Luckily my partner got to feel it too =)|`|7YWaao6Raa	wha?|`|AA11085356	I really don't think it was the heartbeat. It was probably the baby moving around in your tummy. Mention it to the doctor on your next appointment, he should kno what it is.|`|LKbMSajFaa	its not possible. if i was most of us wouldnt be getting worried, if we could feel it.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Sounds like a heartbeat but maybe it was yours but it could be the baby's|`|16HN5H3Maa	Yes, it's probably possible, remember-nothing's impossible.|`|mJ9BveFjaa	Don't ask me..|`|TY8FNnW0aa	I'm nearly 19 weeks and have felt the same thing|`|hhRuKIzRaa	It is NOT possible to feel the babies heartbeat with your hand....it was probably your own pulse you felt through a vein in your stomach.|`|NI8D46J0aa	It was probably hiccups. Those feel a lot like constant little kicks. In a few more weeks you should be feeling things more consistently.  Good luck!|`|GZrR0uxjaa	i thought i felt that too, but idk it could just be your own heartbeat..|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	I did the same thing about 2 weeks ago(I am now 20wks) I even had my husband feel my belly lol. So I guess my answer is that it is entirely possible.|`|98WKYtfwaa	it's impossible to feel the babys heartbeat with your hand.     it was probably the baby moving around, i felt those kinds of feelings when i was about 17weeks, it was my son moving.|`|0hRTaqJCaa	yep its possible..i felt that too when i was pregnant with my second also|`|X7hm4fJXaa	maybe , but if you felt it on your palm , it could of been some vain in your palm that has high pressure in it which could of possibly felt like a heart beat|`|IOU6zo9Raa	totally possible. It's probably your own pulse your feeling though. You have so much more blood flow during pregnancy, and the baby is so small right  now to feel it's heartbeat. You can feel movement as early as like 12 weeks. Most women know the difference between gas and a baby!|`|E3yOmel9aa	It may have been gas or a muscle spasm.
58d34da1292dde1e2adf19fa22f4fdbeaa	I've had a miscarriage, too, and it's tough.  You need to grieve.  The baby was a real person and she died.  You were the only one who knew her.  As for dealing with the depression, try drinking coffee, getting extra sleep, working out, journaling, and talking to other people about it who've been through it.  Make sure you don't talk to people who haven't gone through it, because they won't understand and will make it worse.    As for the bleeding, have you passed your placenta yet?  That may be it, or it might be your first period.  Your periods will be a little more painful than usual for the first month or two, then they'll even out.    You won't test positive if it has been more than two weeks after the miscarriage.  If it's less, one of them was a faulty test and you need to test it a third time to see if you were pregnant in the first place.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	See your doctor to make sure and also get some help about the depression.  I am very sorry...  Talk to someone.   You are already making strides by talking on here.   It helps to talk to someone.   I understand depression and loss but not of a child.   If you ever need an ear...|`|iyL6dyMyaa	Well I didn't think I could even have kids.  My first child was a miscarriage I only carried for 2 months, then I started having stomach aches, and not feeling pregnant anymore, they sucked the baby out of me.  So then my sister went on to have her second baby, while I couldn't even have my first.  It was horrible.  Finally 2 years later, I tried again and my doctor made sure I stayed pregnant this time.  She made me take a baby tylenol, and be light on my feet.  It worked.  And now I have my beautiful son 2o-months.  My sister went on to have about 3 kids total.  But I'm happy with my one.  You'll have a baby, just wait a minute, let your body heal up.  YOu will be depressed for a while, but just calm down, and try again later.|`|pIBOSkfsaa	i understand your pain, it feels lonely for a while, but be strong , after i lost my child , i started exercising regularly, I found it really helped with my depression to keep moving and having a small goal in mind untill i could try again , i just kept thinking , "i gotta get back into shape for the next one", maybe that could help for you, good luck and take care.
T1T4vIZoaa	David Cook.  There's something about him I've liked, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  David Archuleta and his music just doesn't interest me at all. I don't really like that teen pop style music.|`|oKZ3GstXaa	David Cook, he is just better all around  Archuleta, act like he is 5, he doesnt know how to handle the fame,|`|k6XRVeJxaa	Archuleta.|`|XwrjRj52aa	Hmm, neither, their both okay. I suppose David Cook. I liked Josiah the best :) too bad he never made it to the top 12 guys :( he should have. And I am a Daughtry fan all of the way.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I have no idea who they are.|`|Bcfw1rweaa	Archie!!    i luv h is singing better.|`|fDEDg0ZOaa	i like david archuleta better. the age has notin to do with it i just just like his music better then cook's. archuleta is better looking too so|`|gYWeTSvTaa	archuleta; i like his lyrics. i relate to them more than i do cooks.|`|VixocvbDaa	David Cook a 100% I went to the school that he went to. But I don't like him because of that but I just love the way he sings. He is very kind and cool!! Well good luck with your debate with your friend!|`|5tqh0akYaa	David Cook      why would age matter? im not marrying them    and i like him for his music and looks a little bit|`|FGZR9RwDaa	david coooook(:  i like his music, and he's hott. (:|`|ziCuHSy1aa	Neither.|`|2OYyljWEaa	I don't like either but I would say Cook.|`|CI5qOBcDaa	david cook. i saw both of them live and i orginally liked archuleta but cook was AMAZING. and that's why.|`|AmqQ9it5aa	David Archuleta. He is young and innocent like me.
Zx8uw3I2aa	i would get a blood test done by your doctor.. its basically 100% accurate... and i know a few people who taken tests that say positive but theyre not..    ... sounds like shes pregnant to me.. but go get the blood test done [:    and if not, then there always next month..    *bAbY dUsT*    x|`|yJ8BR8ujaa	Sounds like a chemical pregnancy. This is when you get a positive pregnancy test and then a negative.So she could have been pregnant for a moment but lost it which is the reason for the negative now. its very rare to have a false positive especially 2 tests in a row. You should be using the same brand of test though as each test tests HCG hormone differently. She should get a blood test done.|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	Sounds like you are testing very very early if she just had a period in January.  Pregnancy tests (even in the same brands) differ in the level of hcg they detect.  I would wait until 1 week after her missed period to test as then, if she is pregnant her hcg levels will be doubling every 2 to 3 days.  If she isn't, then she had an early miscarriage.  The only thing that can cause a false pregnancy is if she is taking fertility drugs, as hpts only detect hcg at certain levels and your body does not produce it unless you are pregnant or taking fertility drugs.|`|c20ifVL4aa	Yes she is pregnant. Its possible to get a false negative but not a false positive. The pregnancy hormone is very dominant. If you call any clinic to ask them they will tell you that. If you still want to be sure I would recomend getting a blood test done by a doctor.    GOOD LUCK, DAD!|`|8V39PymEaa	get a blood test done|`|bZBByJAAaa	I read on a parenting magazine that when a test turns out negative it could be wrong and the woman could still be pregnant. But when it's positive, it's 100% accurate and there's a pregnancy. Try the ept tests, they're the best and tell you with words (PREGNANT/NOT PREGNANT). I took 3 tests because the first one had a fainty line. You can't go wrong with a blood test either.|`|OYvviDoTaa	My friend was 8 weeks pregnant when she tried HPT and all of them came up negative..Blood tests are more accurate..    Good Luck =)|`|4yGGjs7zaa	the best thing to do is go see a doctor! they can do a blood test if you explain what has happened with the home tests!|`|L6oSDA5Yaa	this could be a early Miscarage... sorry to tell you that, make a doc app.
lGcpXteaaa	My daughter was rocking back and forth on her knees at 5 months and on the day she turned 6 months she crawled.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	My daughter didn't start crawling until 10 months. She was a late one :)|`|pXSKSS3daa	Well, Noah will be 10 months old on the 4th and he finally started crawling this past week. We're actually baby proofing this weekend.    He looked like he was going to take off from about 6 months on but didn't get the hang of it until over Christmas vacation when he finally started rocking on his hands and knees(he was just shy of 9 months at this time).|`|fHjSonssaa	My son is 10 months.  He was late 8-9 months when he really started to get the handle on it- I think he's already sick of crawling and wants to walk already  =)|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	My LO hated tummy time, she wouldn't do it, so I didn't even bother. She rolled just fine. Then one day, she sat up then within weeks of that she did the army crawl then by 6 months she was off, she crawled like she had places to go , babies to see. She's a fast booger, even now with walking..ugh.|`|nHpd4lRXaa	Our son began crawling at 7.5 months. It is still wobbly, and he still sometimes inches along. But he can hand&knee crawl, sometimes he is just to lazy to, but he can certainly get from Point A to Point B, no doubt about that.|`|5udXQ79Laa	My baby is 9 months and three weeks.  He just started crawling last week!  Yay!|`|vewYW4wcaa	10 months when he took his official crawl|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	My son started crawling from the sitting position rather than being on his tummy, and it happened around 7 1/2 months. My 10 month old nephew still isn't crawling though, and it's all in the normal range. I'm sure your little guy will take off one of these days :-) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-0CZIi8Z...|`|yGPRntXFaa	a little after 2 months...........  towards the third.......... then it slowed down... they squat and move their legs and about around the 4th , you can't stop them  lol...........  Best of luck to you and your baby.. there is no specific time but there is a range of time.... if it goes over 5, 6, 7 months  then the doctor should take a look....... tell your doctor during the visits............................... if you have no insurance...get some help somewhere in your county.. best of luck and be blessed......    Please let me know if this works for you....  Thanks and be blessed....|`|ZVHtkTS9aa	my son was about 7-8 months, he crawled commoando style on his tummy for months, before, he started to crawl normally, my daughter was about the same age, but she crawled normally right from the start.|`|qKnE08Rxaa	My baby's 7 month & she does not crawl. She keeps her butt up but she can't pull herself. She had a strong neck since 4 weeks & wanted to stand since she was 2 month old. I think my baby's going to skip crawling & go right into walking. (I heard some babies do that)|`|vJEatJFPaa	Olivia started crawling a week before she turned 7 months..Shes 8 1/2 months now.|`|BsRMGbCDaa	my baby started at 6 months|`|9ozDCTDTaa	My little one will be 9 months tomorrow and just started crawling last Saturday!  She spent a good 2 months getting up on all four and then just rocking without going anywhere... we kept thinking it would be any day!|`|C0WRHLbhaa	My son was about 7 months when he started creeping but by 8 months he was crawling
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Any all natural oil; olive, vegetable, coconut, almond. I don't know in what amounts you're using the lasolin stuff but the baby may develop a wool allergy if it's used excessively.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Try Lanolin for cracked peeling nipples..it is safe for babies to have in their mouth already, so why not try that?  it does help the nipples while breast feeding. For when they crack and get real dry.   The kind I have is Lansinoh Lanolin.    More: yea, just keep adding that through out the day, especially when he goes down for a nap and at night.|`|Fkl6gV8Qaa	Try  putting one of those little mittens on that hand and see if that deters him a little bit. I don't think that it's a bad habit compared to some others but it isn't a good  one if it is causing him pain in the long run.|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	Funny my daughter was doing the same thing I used the lanolin cream you use nipples when breastfeeding because it will not hurt them if they eat it also I put a sock on her hand she just sucked the sock|`|gFiRi5xnaa	Definetly get the sock mittens. You can get them at any baby store or probably Wal-Mart too.|`|3klIx1Egaa	put lotion on it before he goes for a nap.. i have the same problem with my son|`|vewYW4wcaa	vaseline and and cover it up with a sock. or maybe will he take a soother?
gTjtaG0Faa	Speaking as a person who had pre eclampsia, being induced can only help you in the long run.  They want to give you minute to minute care to monitor you to help save your life and your babies.  I ended up having a very rare (very very rare) side effect and I was very very happy to have a full day of care before delivering my first baby.  I did not that time need to be induced however if my daughter had not started the contractions they would have induced me within a couple of days.  Its easier to have your baby sooner then later as they only keep growing :)  As to the tears and high emotion - your pregnant its very hard to keep calm about anything.  Good luck|`|A5cseSA6aa	nothing you can do it anymore, think about it, would having baby today or tomorrow change anything for you??? I don't think so, if doctor advised you to be induced, then go for it... I was induced 4 weeks ago, because my waters brake and I didn't have any contractions, so I went to hospital with all my suitcase and they wanted to send me home for another 24-48 hours to wait for contarctions... I said no way, I made my way here and I want this baby to come out asap... That's how I got indused, don't worry and go for it. Just make sure they are giving you strong pain killers as soon as you start feeling contractions,  don't play with TENS or paracetamol.   I had every 3 minutes contractions for 11 hours, so epidural was the only thing that kept me going.  Good luck and go for it.|`|ggfE4rlvaa	You could have the baby, lol. That's the only thing, being induced isn't bad at all. You'll get an IV anyways, then they will put a drug into your IV, next thing you know you're having contractions! Nothing to be scared of.|`|jC1Mdsefaa	Well you are going to have to have it anyway sometime or another.  I would go with what the doctors say and get the enduction done.  It could do more harm than good if you keep putting it off..    This is the babys time to come out, why dont you want to have the baby, havent you been preparing for this day for the past 40 weeks?|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I cried when they told me.   I was there for an appointment.   They would not let me leave as the baby was in distress and I had low amniotic fluid.   It was not bad at all.   Within 24 hours I was stitched up and had a bright eyed baby boy at my breast.   Ahhh....I miss having a baby. All mine are almost grown it seems.|`|7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	If the baby's vitals are okay I think I'd give it a few more days. I had to be induced and had a c-section and everything was fine.  Just relax and become used to thinking about what is best for the baby.  Good Luck|`|VFUdAtrHaa	I don't think you know how serious preclampsia really is. I had it with my son i passed out and was rushed to the hospital and had to be induced asap. They put me on mag sulfate to stop me from seizing. I had a min siezure and it scared the s h i t out of me. no lie. You too call your doctor tell them you've made a mistake and you would like to b induced now and that you were just scared. If it turn in to full blown eclampsia not only your life but your babys is at risk. Im only telling you this because i went threw it. Just make sure you eat before you go and GOOOOO!!     Good luck!|`|vewYW4wcaa	Get some groceries and make you favorite meal. Then get some paper and plan everyhting down to the last detail for if you are induced on monday. do you have a birth plan? Just listen to your body and dont do anything that you arent comfortable with. also, just from personal experience, when being induced ask about epidurals, they make you feel wonderful and totally help you relax while in labor. do you have someone at home? or a pet? have some cuddle time!|`|kOz3T3Buaa	My boy was late for 5 days, and my water ruptured before he was born. Though induction day was already set. I was induced, and let me tell you i didn't eat anything from the morning until I delivered.   Trust me it is good for you if you won't have anything in your stomach.   You will be fine, think of the baby, s/he probably wants to see you and feels your hug.  So be good girl, and just do it!|`|AA11349925	Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear you're having such a rough time.    I know it's a difficult thing to accept and nerve wracking! I have been where you are. If it really is the best thing for your baby then it will have to be done, unless they can agree to scan or monitor you on a machine every few days and you keep a note of babies movements, maybe they will allow you to be admitted until labour starts so that you are in the right place should they need to act quickly.    try to remember just like natural labours, induced labours are different for each woman if you have heard horro stories it doesnt mean the same will be true of your induced labour, many women have great induced labours.|`|4X6MwQJRaa	Just think that once you are induced it wont be long before you are holding you little bundle of joy in your arms.     My story is .. last Friday I was shopping in Asda when I thought I had wet myself a little bit!  Over night I kept leaking so phoned the midwife Saturday morning.  I hadn't felt many movements so she suggested I go in to be monitored.  While there they did an internal and told me that my water had broken and they would need to induce me that day!  Oh my god I paniced!!  I was so ready to have the baby (was 39+2) but when she said that I suddenly thought I wasnt ready.  Just take a deep breath and think the quicker you are induced the quicker you will have your baby.      Its a very exciting time and there will be no more waiting and wondering when things will start.  The midwifes at the hospital I was at were so amazing and looked after me so well.  Honestly its not bad at all being induced.  I was so worried about it and now I have a beautiful 5 day old little girl who is the centre of my world already.  If I hadnt been induced she may not have been here yet!!    Good luck hun .. honestly you will be fine.  It has to happen some time!|`|EsGrIscFaa	You just have to think about it as rationally as possible and focus on the outcomes - seeing your baby! Make sure you take plenty of distractions when you go back in - snacks, ipod, magazines, puzzle book etc - so that you can take your mind off of what's going on. Also if you're really worried about the pain then consider your pain relief options.   Just remember it's going to happen one way or another so you might as well get it over and done with. And nobody will think your daft for being scared. x|`|WGXdfh22aa	i can understand where you are coming from. i am 39 weeks and at my last appointment i was 4 cm and my doctor told me that if i hadnt gone into labor by my next appointment i would be induced on my due date since i as so far dilated. so since she told me that ive been trying everything to get myself to go into labor because i dont want to be induced. so far it hasnt worked. i would much rather go into labor myself then be induced. when  you go into labor yourself your body is doing it whereas when your induced i dont like the thought of my body being forced and having to lay in a hospital bed. it just seems better to be to go into labor myself.|`|JDw1RDcaaa	calm yourself by having a nice bath and a nice warm drink and go and get into bed and forget about it by watching a film or reading a book, then get up early in the morning and make yourself a backed lunch and just go to the hospital and just ask them to check you over (dont think about the being induced bit) then see what they say if they want to induce go for a walk around the hospital by yourself and have a really good think about it, remember if you go though with it you could be a mum by tomorrow night and you will be able to see what all your hard work was for. You never know they might just say go home and see if you feel ok the next day. When you go to the hospital have your bag with you and have some food with you and just see what they say and then think about it, but if your anything like me you will feel better maker the decision when you are on your own.    I am 35 weeks pregnant and i am being tested every two days for pre eclampsia and im not prepared in my head to be induced yet but everyday i am getting better and ive even but my bag in the car now for my next test on Monday, I am getting a bit excited now even though if my little man is born now he might be ill because he would be a little early but i go in his room every morning before i am tested and i think i might have a little person to put in there the next day.    Just think about it your little one is going to be healthy and is ready.    Good Luck  x|`|J9YVjuI0aa	hi congrats on being pregnant, but dont be sorry its a big thing for all pregnant mothers how and when it happens. just lie down close your eyes and imagine the moment you first hold your child and how that will feel and there is very good pain relief in hospital take it all i did and i had the best experence ever because i was calm and not in pain. My girl is perfect and i would do it all again tomorrow|`|y0OwKPaMaa	I'm not due for a couple of months so haven't really got to your state yet!    The fact of the situation is you are going to have to give birth at some time and it's probably just your pregnancy hormones giving you grief so just "deal with it" or so to speak.  The little one is going to have to come out at some point so why wait if you don't have a choice?  I know I'd love to pop mine out now but I am about three months too early so just say yes if they ask to induce you again and enjoy it.
bZBByJAAaa	Sex could induce labor but doctors are not against it. Some even suggest it because you're right, it helps with labor. The more sex you have while pregnant, the easiest your delivery. Either sex, walking or both. Both are good and both could induce labor towards the end.|`|claW4UUcaa	sex is fine during pregnancy and could even help induce labor. the only time you need to avoid it is if your doctor has told you to. or obviously your in labor. he will worry about you whether he is voicing his concern or not. just like you worry about him being over seas. try going out on a date. come home and just talk and cuddle and see where it leads :P    good luck and congrats on the little one.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Well if he doesn't have a 2 footer there is no way he will harm you or the baby, so no worries dad.

QsbB6vkoaa	you have to think of all the things you like about yourself.  and all the things your body does for you. also try to get involved in something like a sport or a charity. also don't spend all of your time in a mirror. just get ready and you'll see that people will like you for you and not your body. do you have friends? why do you like them ? is it because they are really pretty and skinny? probably not. it's probably because they are good friends and nice. this goes for you too. if people like you it's because you are a nice person and you are fun to be around with. and the only person who thinks you are ugly and fat is you. so instead of changing your body, turn of that negative voice in your head. tell it it's not going to ruin your life, and that people are worth more because what's on the inside. looking good is important for feeling good and we all have days where we feel ugly, but it shouldn't be constant that's not a way to live. help other people who need you. go to a hospital and visit sick children. write letters to people in need like our soldiers. this things will make you happy and a happy person feels beautiful inside and out.|`|6gthdHpnaa	Stop focusing so much on your looks and weight, you're great just the way you are. Make a list of all your accomplishments and good things you have done for others. (When you help others, it makes you feel happy inside, which raises your self-esteem.) Write down how you like your hair. When you're feeling bad about yourself, look at the list you have made and you will probably feel better. You might try seeing the guidance counselor at school if this is a big issue for you.  Good luck!|`|ZQdn9xMPaa	Ok I only got one, but it worked for me when I was your age...First there is no way to magically get a high self esteem, sooooo fake it til you make it!!!

H2IhRXIIaa	From what my doctor told me its normal. I had the same issue. When I would walk to fast or up and down stairs. But at one point it just killed me! So I went to the doctor and I had a bad kidney infection, and see the doctor kept telling it was normal..instead of doing pee or blood test! I had to go to the hosiptal to find that out!|`|iyL6dyMyaa	yeah I had them all the time, I would just lay in the bed like a big old whale!  It's normal.

xue72D76aa	I don't have any advice about the cereal but I wanted to post some advice about the breastmilk.  I am a working mom so I needed to get a "stash" of milk for others to feed my daughter while I was at work.  I started eating oatmeal and taking fenugreek to help with milk production.  It has worked wonders!  I now no longer worry about having enough pumped breastmilk.  Just a suggestion if you really wanted to get enough expressed breastmilk to mix with the cereal...  Good luck!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	well most say either / or; dont know what kind you have...can u put some fruit in it?|`|1ScoQM0faa	i also exclusivly breastfeed, but have just started my daghter on porridge.Its cow and Gate.U just add water.it makes as a great meal for the day time, and when i give it yo her at 1pm,she doesnt feed to around 7pm|`|qjDxKXENaa	ive tried the same for my daughter. you can give baby rice but with water first which makes it light. but if you want to try the normal cerial then they are ok, you wouldnt know which milk is added but they dont do any harm, i havent had any problems with my daughter untill now and she has been having them for a month now.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Ask the doctor... buy the cereal powder and mix it as it says....... ask your mom and grandma if you still have them.......... but always follow the doctor......so ask as many trustable people and go from there........ if you can call the hospital where your had your baby, usually there is a nurse 24 hours that can answer questions..........confidentially.......     Please let me know if this works for you....  Thanks and be blessed....|`|ff4be252ca1bd5dd48919f16e87d90c2aa	Before i start this is under my husbands name has mine keeps signing out.    First of all how old is your baby? If your baby is over 6-8 months your better off using normal cereal which you add cows milk to. Cows milk is really good for them. However giving a baby formula & breast milk does not harm your baby in the slightest the only thing reason your health visitor tells you not to switch milk (formula milk that is) is because if one of them was too rich for your baby and your baby's nappy deposits were a little soft you wouldn't know which formula caused it. At the end of the day whether it's cereal with formula, nuts, potatoes or milk your baby needs to try them. No one can say that your baby won't be allergic and no one can say you baby will be.  It's an important part of development, you will not know until you try. You can't keep your baby a baby forever (even though we would all love it if we could, including me) so just try it, the worst it could do is make the nappy deposits softer it can't & will not harm your baby. If after a week everything is normal it's great.|`|NroZQN5vaa	I wouldn't think it would cause any problems but talk to your doctor to be sure. You can just call and ask them. They'll tell you what's best.|`|X6tVveLzaa	First of, even though it is really common to start a baby off with cereal as the first food, it is certainly not necessary. I would suggest a veggie first, such as avocodo, broccoli (steamed), or even a fruit such as banana.     For one of the above, pop it in the blender or food processor with a little water until it is about the consistency of a milk shake, just one item at a time of course, using just the one for several days before you add a new one, so that you can detect any allergies and know where it came from.     If you are set on using a cereal, there are many that don't have formula in them. A simple rice cereal with as few ingredients as possible would be ideal. mix in a little bit of water until the consistency is right, or half water half breastmilk (there is no reason to use formula at all!), and feed a bit at a time.     If your baby is under six months, you don't need to start introducing solids yet at all. If baby has the "tongue thrust reflex", where she is pushing the food back out again after trying it for a few times, give up and wait a couple more weeks.     As a nursing mom you are already doing your little one a huge favor. He/she needs no extra nutrition aside from that for a bit yet. At six months even, the point of solids is for variety and getting them used to the new textures, etc rather than nutritional value.     kellymom.com is an excellent resource for all things baby and breastfeeding.     Best of luck to you, and congrats for nursing!!
7HzfgRmwaa	lol. Pelvic rest DOES include orgasms. Better not chance it.. Just be horny and let it pass :(|`|tbeO3Lataa	Having an orgasm is not going to kill you. It is not great as it does cause the muscles to contract, but if it is something you do to relieve the stress of all of it, I wouldn't worry too much.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Probably does.  Ask your doctor.

I wouldn't advise it,but it would be better to hear this from a doctor.
98WKYtfwaa	Palmers cocoa butter  Bio Oil  Vitamin E capsules  Shea butter (all natural)  Johnsons baby oil is supposed to work good too.    Let me tell you, i pay 22 for a small tub of natural shea butter, i use palmers cocoa butter and bio oil, i use them in turn twice per day.     I've still got stretchmarks appearing, i'm only 19weeks but they're showing on my breasts already. I'm small and petite too. You won't be able to stop them appearing, you'll only be able to help them not show as bad as what they would if you weren't doing anything to your skin. You should start right away to get your skin more elasticy for when you start showing.    Also, be sure to apply on breasts, back, stomach, lower abdomen, thighs and bum. You can get stretchmarks anywhere inbetween there. Oh, drink 2 litres of water per day and do some light exercising, this will help tone up the skin and keep it hydrated, this will help a bit!|`|vewYW4wcaa	I used Burt's Bees vitamin E and lemon oil, it smells great and when you put it on right after the shower it makes skin sooo soft. And i only got three tiny marks on my hip that were gone a month after my baby was born.|`|EqGSu0W1aa	I used cocoa butter and this one called bag balm when I was pregnant religiously and I still got stretch marks. I would say start now, but I don't think it will do you much good.Good Luck to you!|`|rseR7Camaa	Buy some vitamin E capsules, break them open (I used a safety pin) and squeeze the gel/oil on your tummy and everything...  its the best way to go

AmqQ9it5aa	Say :    I wouldn't say this if I didn't care. Sometime the way you dress is a little much. I see the dirty looks people give you and the things they say. I don't care but I don't like hearing it because I care about you.    Teach her tips like the bend over test.    1.Stand behind her and when she bends over and you can she he underwear make her change the skirt or wear a belt or better pants.    2. Another one of my tips when you wear an outfit that isn't for the beach only pick one part to have out.    For example, If you show legs leave the arms covered.If you show chest and arms don't show anything slighty above the knee.    3. Have someone look you up and down for visible bra straps and underwear.|`|HOdblqIkaa	depends on how good of friends you are   if your close then come right out and say it   shell take offense but at the same time shell look into it   if your not close then just tell her maybe she should cover up with a nice big hoodie|`|clFTA9fDaa	If you have a relationship that you can joke around with each other and stuff, just come out and be like pull up your shirt before something get's lost in there!

7HzfgRmwaa	Although your plan sounds terrific there is no way that you can enforce it.. You can keep him away for the pregnancy if he doesnt agree to your terms but as soon as that baby is born he can choose to fight for visitation or custody which he will most likely get and then he may see that baby and be involved without doing any of your terms. You probably should just tell him that that is how you would like it to be and it would benefit him and your relationship as parents if he would participate like you want him to.|`|44OH7Si6aa	He certainly needs to make the baby a priority, but if he doesn't want to be with you, you can't force it. He is doing the right thing so far, he isn't denying the child and is expressing interest. I am so sorry you got yourself into this situation but ultimatums aren't the way to go. Leave it at talking about the baby and what is best for the baby right now. The relationship between the two of you may improve and turn into what you want it to be, but you need to accept that it may not happen. What's best for the baby is to have both mommy and daddy in it's life, and if daddy is unwilling to be in a relationship with you you still need to let daddy be with the child. The only things you should require from him are that he show interest in the progress of your pregnancy, offer financial assistance to obtain all the things you will need for baby and attend the sonogram appointments. I hope everything works out for you and most of all I hope y'all can work together for the baby's sake|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This is tough.  It is possible though not easy for a man to be a good father and a part of his child's life even if he is not in a relationship with the mother.  I think you have a right to demand that he be a part of your pregnancy and help you sort things out for the baby.  However if you'd like him to be a part of the kid's life, you may also have to make some concessions.    Unfortunately, you can't compel him to be your boyfriend even if he is the father of your child.  Demanding that he be a part of your child's life doesn't necessarily mean the same thing as demanding that he be a huge part of yours.|`|66bc4129385331039e67c99220c312fcaa	Now that you are going to be a mom, you need to realize that it isn't all about you anymore. You are lucky that he wants to be a part of the baby's life. Some men run when they hear "pregnant" He doesn't have to be there for you, but he does have a legal right to be a part of the baby's life regardless of what you want. Sorry to sound so mean, but it is the truth and it is time to approach this in a mature manner.|`|FdQD8H3qaa	I think that if he wants to be a part of his child's life then he should be there for the baby 100% or not at all.... but I think it is crazy for you to say that he has to be 100% in your life too!  My dad and mom got married because they were pregnant with me... He is a great dad but didn't love my mom....  He stayed with her until I was 16 and my sister was 14 (until he felt like he made enough to pay for the house that my mom and I lived in and have an apartment for himself and also my mom was really sick when I was little so he wanted to wait until she was better)  It was really hard on me because I felt like he had stayed because he had to because of me but that wasn't it... He stayed because my sister and I were worth it to him....  So don't try to trap the guy into being with you just because you are having a baby... let him be in his child's life but realize that you both should be able to find the person that is going to want to be with you because of who you are not because they got you pregnant!        just a note.... even with my husband he didn't go to all of the Dr. appointments or the baby shower...  Just the big appointments like the first one that you hear the heart beat and the ultrasound.... he still has to work to bring home the money.|`|X6as2nOAaa	It sounds to me like you want him in your life not just the baby's. I don't think he needs to meet your grandparents as your boyfriend he can help tell them that you are pregnant. Don't force him to be your boyfriend. If you want him in the babies life then let him be.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I agree with you, he needs to be there 100% for you and the baby or not at all, he cant pick and choose what he wants to be apart of also he sounds like he is not a reliable person so when the baby is born have him pay child support and I would give the baby your last name. Im in the kind of the same situation, the only difference is that we are still together. You need to sit down and tell him every thing you told us. you are being 100% rational =)|`|ei6dMFYGaa	You may be using the pregnancy as a way to get him back, but you should want him to be part of you kids life even if you 2 are not together.  Sry to say but you should of thought about your future w him before you got pregnant.  Trust me you would want him to be part of your life because he want s to be there, not because there was an ultimatum.|`|87WOSjwgaa	Ok first of all you cant stop him from seeing his child. It isnt legal for you to do so. He has just as much right to be there as you do. Sorry but that is how it is. Second of all why would you want to be with somebody who doesnt want to be with you and who also cheated on you. That doesnt sound like somebody that would be good to be with. What is saying he isnt going to do it again? Be a good mother to your child and leave the door open for him to be there. Then it is his choice!|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	Why would you enforce a guy, whose been cheating on you, to be apart of your life? He cheated on you not pregnant, so he will cheat on you while pregnant and maybe give you a few STDs along the way. And that is really bad for an unborn baby. The guys a loser. He cheats on you. Why would you want to have anything to do with him on a personal level. And why would you want to keep going through that, time after time? Sounds like a nightmare.  He needs to be apart of the baby's life. He needs to be there for the baby. He needs to pay you support. You need to set up custody and have that in writing.  Verbal agreements do not work, especially if he decides to take the baby and not bring it back. The courts and police won't even look at you because there was no agreement and he is the father. You need to get an apartment or somewhere that its just you and the baby. You can get baby stuff on your own. Make a list, do some research and get it all from 2nd hand stores.   He doesn't want to be a family. He wants to party and fool around. Your pregnant. His priority is the baby, not you. And that should be more important to you then anything else. Him cheating on you just proves to me that he wants nothing to do with you anyways.  He won't forget about all the other girls. Seems to me, he forgot all about you. Why would you want this guy as a partner? He's no good. But if you want to try and force him into doing things he doesn't want to do, good luck with that. But you should just let him go. Who cares right?
AOvtRBU9aa	I think three weeks is too early for tummy time. You should be fine to put your baby on his tummy once the fracture is healed. For clavicle (collar bone) fractures, there really isn't anything they can do for it but to let the fracture heal. Don't rush the 6 weeks though because the last thing you want to do is reinjure it again.|`|9ozDCTDTaa	Unless someone on here has had actually experience with a baby and a broken collar bone, I don't think you should be looking for that type of advice on here.   Just give his Dr a quick call, they will be more than happy to answer your question (and if not you need a new doctor!).  Best of Luck!|`|lCtaG73Uaa	I agree with a few other people, I wouldn't risk it. He's only 3 weeks old afterall. Theres really no reason to be concerned about his muscle mass now. Let the bone have at least another week to heal more and then I'd call the doctors and ask them about it.     But NO, don't put him on his tummy without consulting the doctor about it first!!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would let the bone heal, and get the ok from doc before i tried it...no need to rush it, he will catch up just fine...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This sounds like a really unusual situation that you should probably consult your doctor about.  But I do think that tummy time probably does not count as "being extremely careful with his right side."    He can survive without tummy time for a few more weeks.  Yeah, it's good for babies, but this is a special case.|`|yGPRntXFaa	Don't do anything that your read online or in magazines... first ask a doctor and you may inquire about it or mention it and see what the doctor says.......in the other hand if your baby gets hurt what will you tell them... that you read it online....... it's great that you came online to ask but take it as simple advice...........   if you can, go to a different doctor and see what he or she suggests...    Best to you and your baby... be blessed.........|`|kw80YHMLaa	If he does not seem to be in any pain or distress i would let in lie on a mat after all he is only 3 weeks he cant move about much.

FFbWgs0Xaa	I love the name Rebecca.  It is classy and pretty and feminine but also strong.  Becky and Becca are really cute nicknames.  I also like the alternative spelling; Rebekah.|`|riNjJYwXaa	I like the name rebecca because i also like the shorter version beckii or becky =D|`|dPULl5hjaa	Rebecca - NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER......UGLY UGLY FOREVER FOREVER AWFUL name...........

Oh, another thing about Becky - should you call her Rebecca - she would tell you off any time or day!|`|5eKS8Dzcaa	i dont like it, but whatever you want.  and dont name the pretend baby that, save it for your real baby if you like it that much.    if you liked the name michelle, would you name it after a stuffed animal?  you need to save the names you like for stuff thats important.|`|bZBByJAAaa	It think's ok. I like the nickname Becca.|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Nice name!    Very popular but gorgeous!

6igjX2cnaa	hey girl, yes unfortunately clomid was not the med for me.  I was on Femara before that and the femara didn't get my follies where they needed to be by midcycle and my lining was only 6mm by midcycle on Femara.... SO.. my RE switched me to Clomid 50mg cycle days 5-9.  I chose to be monitored mid cycle instead of a 21day progesterone draw.  Thank goodness I did!  By mid cycle I had WAY too many maturing follies and the clomid thinned out my lining to 4.5mm (waaaay too thin).  My nurse gave me a trigger shot just being hopeful something would stick in my too thin of a lining, but nope, BFN.  Being on Clomid longer would have really hurt my lining!  My RE took me off Clomid right away.  I am now on Femara again + Gonal-f injectable meds and I used a trigger shot to ovulate.  I'm doing a LOT better this cycle.  On cd 13 I had one 19mm follie and one 18.5mm follie on the right and a 16mm on the left and my lining was 10mm!!  They like it to be above 8mm for implantation.  So this combo hybrid seems to be working for me.  Clomid might just do the trick for you though girl :)  Good luck and Best wishes hun!!
HOdblqIkaa	its fine that you want to be alone but its also not healthy you should want to spend time with your peers. if large groups make you nervous just stay with a close group of a few friends the more you grow the more comfortable you will feel in your own skin, youll grow out of it.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	its not a bad thing but you might find that once you get more comfortable in those kind of situations theyre actually fun! i used to be sooo shy but i forced myself to break out of my shell a little and other people aren't so bad actually. :)|`|T1T4vIZoaa	Just try not to be uncomfortable. There's a few girls like that in my school. I think they're a bit weird.|`|6gthdHpnaa	I'm the same way, and there's nothing wrong with me.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	It's not bad, but it's not healthy if you do that forever.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Use your alone time to enrich yourself in some way, that way if someone bugs you about it you can always say, yeah well at least I was (fill in the blank). I am a pretty heavy reader, so I spend a lot of my time if not alone then closed off to what's going on around me. No one really bugs me about it.|`|UNLrYNeUaa	wow, you're exactly like me, I go to places and am around a lot of people but just stay to myself and I prefer to be alone and away from everyone and feel a lot more relaxed that way too. it's not a bad thing at all|`|8vL3Igzjaa	definately try and spend more time with your friends and people your own age, by the time ur a bit older(like 17-18+) if youve never been sociable youll miss a lot and will regret it, so just pick a few close friends and go out with them. they can be your bodyguards.
Fx77zYhWaa	Talk to your doctor.  I've been on 2 types of birth control (no yasmin) and haven't had any problems really.  Some women do have problems with the pill.  Hopefully, your doctor can find a pill that is not going to make your body react badly.  If not you could try the patch, nuvaring, and IUD's.  If you live in Europe you can try the Noraplant.  Good luck.  Hope you can find birth control pill or other method that is right for you.|`|AA11785285	All of the first three respondents have given you good ideas... some of those pills hated me, and other i was just fine with.  Get some advise from your doc, hon, or Planned Parenthood.   bc is free with them if you are under 18.|`|6GIp6pM3aa	I would have your Dr. change your BC. I was having problems on Yasmin and changed to Seasonique. I loved that one!|`|claW4UUcaa	i would try the nuva ring. i had bad luck with yasmin. ortho tri cyclin lo worked for me.|`|e2AGQTSQaa	I tried useing yasmin for birth control and i got pregnant on it. I now have mirena, i think that is how you spell it, It is implanted in you and helps for 5 years, it is pain free and I dont even get my period on it
9eaQye5zaa	I'm sorry for your loss. I think it's admirable of you to want to protect his feelings but I also think it would be REALLY hard to keep a secret like that from your husband. I don't think it's wrong really but he will be happy none the less. I wish you luck.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I'd wait until 12 weeks, after 12 weeks the risk of miscarriage is greatly diminished.   Otherwise, yes you'd be doing your husband an emotional favor, although I don't know if I could keep a secret that long.|`|yCR6qg0baa	Hey, sorry for your loss. I don't think there is anything "wrong" with not telling him... but I know my husband tracks my periods to know when I'll start acting all b*tchy (LOL), so if your husband notices you haven't had a period in 2 months, he may get suspicious. Also, you'll probably have morning sickness & that will be hard to hide (the sound of barfing early in the morning). I understand you're both sad, but you're married-- you're in this together (for better or worse, sad & happy, etc.) and I think I'd tell my husband. Also, what if (God forbid) you have another miscarriage? Will you tell him after the fact so he's not only sad, but feels like you kept a secret from him? I think I'd tell him if I was you.    Wait to tell everyone else until 12 weeks if you want. But don't hide the biggest secret of your life from your husband. I won't tell my family until I get the first ultrasound and make it to the 12 week mark.|`|ukTR7KNSaa	Personally, I would want to know right away.  I'd feel bad if my wife left me out of the loop.|`|bec62dace9d0d98bb1a3ab830e23d22aaa	I have 2 miscarriages and both times I told everyone I was pregnant, then it was gone and I had to tell everyone, it sucked. I think it's a great idea but miscarriage are most common in the first 12 weeks.|`|z6BtwSE8aa	I really think he would want to know. I know mine would. And I mean, he isn't the only getting hurt, you are too, and I think it would be better if you can be there for each other.|`|yznZqcznaa	I was planning on doing this with my husband when I found out I was pregnant because I was so scared of a miscarriage and having to tell him again.  He took the first one really hard and then there was the second,  so with this third pregnancy I just wanted to wait.  However I decided not to and he was upset that I didn't tell him and knew almost a whole day.  He felt like he was left out and wanted to know I was testing.  I assured him that with my obsession for taking pregnancy tests he really didn't want to know, I took like 20 that month.  Anyways think of it the other way around.  We want to know 4 days before our missed period.  What if our husbands knew and didn't tell us.  Man I would be pissed.  He really deserves to know.  All the best to you guys.  Hope you get a new bun soon.|`|AgIjuGaxaa	I think this is a good plan.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	That is probably a good idea and then he never needs to know if you miscarriage again, I would probably do that but is that really something you want to go through alone? You have to think about yourself too.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	first of all what's DH?    i think you have to look out for yourself too.  tell him.  you will need support and he prob would want to know from the beginning.|`|L6oSDA5Yaa	I still think you should tell him, If you guys loose a baby it is both of yours to loose. And you shouldnt have to go through it alone. You should also not have to go through preganancy alone either. I would tell him Hunnie...Baby dust to you... I wish you so much luck!

syrh8J6Vaa	Yes I did.  The rides you need to avoid are rides that are bumpy.  There is no warning about pregnant women riding.  Even though there are two drops they are smooth.  Here is a link to the ride showing no warning for mothers to be.  http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...    if there was any danger they would post a warning to protect themselves from lawsuits.    Here is a link to indiana jones that does have a warning because the ride is bumpy.  http://disneyland.disney.go.com/disneyla...|`|jYPeis3Saa	nope.     they put the signs that say "do not ride if pregnant" for a reason|`|ncHDtTKJaa	Your not meant to go on rides when your pregnant. i like something like the merry go round is ok but thats about it!|`|IOU6zo9Raa	I am also pregnant and due in July. Never went on rides with my first pregnancy, only because there wasn't an opportunity. I went on some this time. Not major rides, but ones I went on with my duaghter. This was about a monbth ago and were both fine. These were kids rides|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Nope I never had the opportunity.  Don't know what I'd do if I did.  Sometimes I think they're being overly cautious because I've seen the do not ride sign if you're pregnant on rides like the merry go round.|`|PfLg9B6aaa	i did at seaworld before i found out.|`|i8Ch743Laa	I know that they advise against it,so I never did. To each his own I guess,but why take the chance of something happening? I didn't,and I won't be this time. They wouldn't have those "Do not ride while pregnant" signs up if it was totally ok for you to do it.|`|5SHPRfUgaa	I rode a roller coaster for my husband at six flags last year. Later that night I found out I was pregnant. Two weeks later I lost the baby. I don't know if I lost the baby because of the rollar coaster but it is definitely something I think about all the time.  I am now pregnant again with a little girl and I wouldn't even dare go on any ride.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Nope. your not suppose to ride rides while pregnant.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Nope. I don't know if you knew you were pregnant or not, but you're not supposed to ride rides when pregnant|`|4259a8b8fa5899f30c0e319fda9936fdaa	I went to Disney when i was 2 months pregnant.  I went on some of the  tame rides, the ones without the health warning.  I also rode one that pregnant women were advised to stay off of....it was in animal kingdom, a safari ride of some sort.  It was driving in a truck on dirt rides....my plane ride had bumpier turbulence than that ride did!!  Of course i stayed off all the other rides (roller coasters, etc.)  I would wait in line with my husband, then when he got on i would step outside and wait for him.  and btw, there is not a pregnancy restriction on pirates of the caribbean...i also rode it a couple of times!  my pregnancy was fine and i carried to full term!

yr1hEsa0aa	I was 16 when I lost mine. I lost it to my boyfriend who was also a virgin. He was about 3 weeks away from 18. Today we celebrated our 5 year anniversary. We have been living together for 2 years with no help from any one but each other. We are working on buying a house a taken the next step.   I think there is no good age but at the same time, you have to be old enough to able to take on the responsibilities that go with having sex. (emotions and having a baby). In the end I wish we would have waited a little longer. But that does not changed how we felt about each other.     *You can only give the gift of yourself ONCE...make sure its to the person you want to spend the rest of your life with!|`|E7ViD8EWaa	The right age?  When you're old enough and mature enough to deal with the consequences.|`|5tqh0akYaa	still a virgin, waiting till im engaged or married.    there isn't a 'right' age . you have to be emotionally and physically ready. everyone has different beliefs      im 14 :)|`|ej6pi4HEaa	I lost my virginity when i was 12, my parents never told me about sex, so i was on my own.

QBuFelkWaa	you can only leave the milk out for one hour room temperature, 24 hours in the fridge. make sure the milk is kept inside the fridge shelves and not in the fridge door.  express after baby has had his feed, that's what i was told to do.  good luck.|`|gx4s68s8aa	They say it stays fresh for longer than you think out of the refrigerator like up to 4 to 6 hours.  But I honestly feel a little strange about leaving it out that long, so I always would put it up within 45 minutes or so.    So just do what you feel comfortable with.  I was always worried that I would forget the milk and then it would go to waste.    http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milks...|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	expressing while feeding on the other breast works great- it stimulates the let-down and you'' catch more milk. you can leave it out in room temp for 6-10 hours depending on the room    Warm room 79F / 25C 4-6 hours   Room temperature 66-72F / 19-22C 10 hours   Insulated cooler / icepacks 60F / 15C 24 hours   Refrigerated Milk (Store at back, away from door)   Refrigerator (fresh milk) 32-39F / 0-4C 8 days   Refrigerator (thawed milk) 32-39F / 0-4C 24 hours   Frozen Milk (Do not refreeze!

Pumping is something you need to figure out for your self what works best. if you can pump in between feedings that would be best.    It stays good longer then 24 hours when kept in the fridge. if you keep it  in the fridge it will last up to 6 days.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	If you are comfortable with breastfeeding then the best time to pump is when you are feeding. So feed your baby off from one breast and pump the other breast at the same time. You will get more out this way.   As far as fridge or not. You do not need to put the milk in the fridge - it can stay out at room temperature for up to 10 hours but it is best if you put it in the fridge.   Make sure you pump at the feeding that your husband is feeding so it keeps the message going to keep producing.

If she's under 10weeks when you go that should be ok.|`|claW4UUcaa	she shouldn't ride the rides|`|AA11206135	No No No rides.... well, nothing more than a merry go round.... (mom of five)|`|N6XTcGejaa	please avoid the rides.|`|p2l8zQYuaa	She can go walking and stuff but not the ride the rides that are forceful or overly going up and down wildly.|`|AA11070364	the only ride she will even be allowed on on is the ferris wheel.the walking around will be good for excercise but probally no fun to her.|`|YPROQpzpaa	There isn't anything wrong with going to the fair, but there is something wrong with her riding,  the motions on the rides can  cost damage to the unborn fetus or most likely have a miscarriage. so the best thing for her to do is walk around and stuff her face.........lol .
1pNt9892aa	I think both of you are off base for assuming that what either one of you does is a more important contribution to your family. I think both jobs have their difficulties. I think your wife does not know how difficult your job can be and I think you don't know how difficult her job can be. Until you walk in eachother's shoes and gain a mutual respect and understanding of equality in your relationship, this relationship will be stuck in a state of tug-of-war over who has the harder time. I have had both experiences, that of the corporate world and as a stay at home mom. I understand the difficulties associated with both. You both deal with different stresses. What your wife says is true, however. Being a stay at home mom is a 24/7 job. She doesn't get a break, you get to come home at night and on the weekends, she is always a mom. Maybe you could try to give her Saturdays to just go out and be alone for a while. Or offer for a family member or friend to watch the baby once a week. Like I said though, both of you need to understand that you are contributing equally to this relationship.
PJYrLxZHaa	First off, I'm so sorry about your losses.     Second, as i'm sure you know, by going to the doctor there is no guarantee they'll tell you you won't have a miscarriage, and there is no way for them to make sure, as you stated. But, I would recommend going to make sure the baby is healthy and that everything is going good with the pregnancy. However, I think that you should tell your husband before you go. He'll probably want to be there. Telling him you're pregnant again I'm sure will make him scared, but I think he absolutely deserves to know, and you'll need the support.    Good luck and congratulations on expecting!!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	you are trying to find out if you need to tell your husband if you are pregnant ?    or should you wait until you go to the dr and make sure you WONT have another miscarriage?    1.  Yes, you should tell your husband.  You should even have to think about that one !  2.  Your dr most likely cant predict if you are going to have amiscarriage or not !|`|b97ab27d62fac407e8f40fe52edd9ae1aa	Well first off congratulations. You should tell him. No matter which way this goes, you will need each other's support. I am very sorry for your numerous losses. Try not to worry too much. Take your prenatals. Eat healthy and enjoy your great news!!    Here's to a sticky bean and a happy and healthy 9 months!!|`|lCtaG73Uaa	Thats so hard. I'm very sorry about your loss. Its a personal thing though. I don't think I could hide something like that from my husband. Do what you think is best. And I wish you all the luck with this pregnancy! Hope everything works out!! =)|`|UmqLkwAraa	If i was you i would tell him because if anything happens then u will feel bad that u didnt tell him and he would be mad u didnt tell him. Think about it ur dream maybe this is the one thats meant to be. Am really sorry to hear about the other ones. But tell him so he can be there for u if anything does happen but i deep down inside think this baby is here to stay and the one for the both of u. Please just tell him and u both know theres a possiblity it might not live. But from ur dream i think deep down inside its the one so tell him. Wish u both the best. Good Luck!!!
L6oSDA5Yaa	it is know that pregnant women get yeast infection i would say it is a sign. and going on what you have hear there is not much. I am in the same boat as you, i would just give it a few more days and test again. You will get you BFP soon! good luck baby dust!|`|3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	You know, myself included, there is a lot of women this month who are late but aren't testing positive. It is possible that you may not being producing enough hormone yet. I am five days late and tested last at 4 day late and got a negative. I am testing again tomorrow morning. Doctor say it is normal to not get a positive until you are a week late.  In fact most doctors won't do a blood test until you are 2 weeks late to ensure that the hormone has enough time to build up.|`|Uxdiv3fdaa	I think this might be a question for a doctor. Professionals offer the best help and if you do not wish to consult one, you might call up a friend or a friend of a friend who also happens to be a doctor.|`|bZBByJAAaa	I had a UTI when I was 15 weeks pregnant. UTI's and yeast infections are common during pregnancy but I couldn't tell if you're pregnant. Big symptoms also include spotting and very tender breasts. I would take another test because sometimes when it turns negative the test could be wrong. But when it turns out positive then it's 100% accurate. Good Luck!
prqrQcd1aa	Here is a web site so you don't have to get a lawyer, you just need to get custody forms... if you can't get them from the court house then get them from here, or find out where you can get them at to fill out on your own. There is no need for a lawyer unless you have done something wrong warrenting you to not see your child except through supervised visits...  That is the LAW... she can't keep the child from you!    http://www.mydivorcedocuments.com/Georgi...|`|QsQj8jO7aa	same situation here but with a 10 month old and the roles are reversed. I want him to have a mom and dad, and she wants to start a life of her own.  In my case their is nothing I can do. If I bother her she'll cut off all communication. I've decided to leave it up to her, if she ever changes her mind she knows my number and where I live.   I know this really sucks but if you think about it, but the only whose going to be hurt is you. A baby that young isn't going to remember you and isn't going to miss you no matter how much you miss him. This has been the only thing that I've been able to do and the only way I've been able to think about the situation. If she takes good care of him I'll be happy, maybe one day I'll see him again and he'll be mine again, or maybe in my future I'll have another kid. Sorry but that's all I've got for you.|`|r18PoGJiaa	Be prepared for an uphill battle.   Get yourself a lawyer. That is the first step.|`|TDGhHIvNaa	Get a lawyer and fight for visitation.  And once those visits are set up, don't miss any of them, or give her a reason to call you on it.  Good luck.   It's nice to see a dad who wants to spend time with his child.|`|Bw18seFqaa	so take her to court for visitation..   you do have the law on your side...  the only way you can be denied it is if you are prooven unfit..  and even at that, you still wont be denied, you will be granted supervised visits!    You pretty much have to have abused the child to be denied visitation!|`|OAyXEtIoaa	i dont know where women got this idea like they have control over a father who wants to love their child, but fight fight fight. fight it man, that is your child too, and the courts will provide you time. take her to court, dont ever let some women have power over you and your child. she is a douche|`|IJq6nYCbaa	Speak with a lawyer as soon as possible...you have parental rights. You may have to request a paternity test in order to prove that the child is yours, and if it is she cannot legally keep you from seeing the child.     I commend you for being honest enough to not keep her hanging on. If you don't love her, you are doing the best thing for her,yourself, and the baby.   You do not have to be with her to be a responsible and loving father.|`|12xQlgr7aa	Take it to court. Maybe it was a mistake to get a child so soon but you can't live in misery because of it. You have every right to be with your son. Definetly take it to court and come to some sort of compromise. Good Luck!

cSm1zod4aa	I have craved jolly ranchers wrapped in beef jerky, pickles and bbq sauce, pickles and ice cream, ice cream, tons of fruit apples, mangos, strawberries, grapes, also pasta like spaghetti, macaroni and cheese, doritos, zebra snack cakes, salad, fresh green beans, stuffing and chicken. theres a lot more lol  I actually don't like getting cravings because its like if i don't get it right now im gonna go insane and i don't like that feeling hahaha.|`|1UpR1vSCaa	Watermelon I LLLLLLOOOVE IT bagels with a lot of cream cheese and oranges|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	Cravings come and go just like everything else. And they're very random sometimes. I have a new one almost every couple days. Or I'll go a week or two were all I want to eat is one or two things. For example, I wanted apples for 2 weeks straight. I did the same thing with peaches. And during my first trimester ALL I could keep down was peanut butter and strawberry jelly sandwiches. That's all I ate for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I'm not 31 weeks and can't smell peanut butter without running. I also craved Taco Bell bean burritos for a little while too.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	My main thing has been ICEEs. Especially the white cherry ones, unfortunatly I think I have to drive half an hour to get one, since I haven't checked out my local convenient stores yet, those and cheese enchiladas as well, well, actually all of anything cheesy, it all call to me especially now.|`|9zMC6EBtaa	Mine have been chips and salsa and donuts.|`|4XfjUcvDaa	my huge craving is salad and bread sticks from olive garden.

Last night I wanted lite popcorn with peanut butter, but didn't have the guts to really try it. But lately its been noting but chinese and japanese food. Which we don' have in this town. Huge bummer.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	My weirdest craving when I was pregnant was roast potato sandwiches :) even though my daughter's 16 days old, I still get the odd urge :D|`|iyL6dyMyaa	I craved cold sandwiches, but I couldn't eat cold cuts, so I would warm them up, and Salads in the beginning, brisket, stupid stuff.|`|IlSALGKMaa	I've been craving Watermelon, Vienna Sausages, Bugels, and black olives. Haha!|`|z0XRuVwSaa	i used to hate strawberry's now ive just ate a pile of them due to cravings with a glass of milk mmmmmmmm
AA11684972	Just keep feeding him. My 6 month old still wakes up in 4 hour increments most nights. Each baby is different and will wake as needed. My little guy is eating cereal and jar food as well as milk, but he just has a tummy that needs food often at night. Its exhausting, but normal.|`|3klIx1Egaa	some babies dont sleep through the night till around a year, some even later. try mixing rice cereal in with his bottle at night and see if that helps him feel fuller. if not, stick it out... eventually he will get through the stage. good luck|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I remember my mom telling me to mix the baby formula and the baby cereal together. If you had an 8 oz bottle instead of putting 4 little scoops to put 2.5 and some cereal. It worked for me great my baby would get more full and stay asleep longer. Good luck!|`|AA12243380	If he is hungry then he is hungry.    I don't like the idea that babies are supposed to sleep through at a certain age.  All people are different.  If he is growing, digesting, he is hungry.  I had twins and they couldn't have been more different.  One slept through at 4 months and the other still sometimes wakes up at 20 months.    If he goes right back to sleep after then just get up, feed him, and go back to sleep.  :-)    Since he's bottle feeding, can you take turns with his dad?|`|VudhjHi2aa	All Babies are different with different sleeping patterns. No baby is the same. What is normal for one might not be for another. If I can recall right when my 11month old was that age he had no pattern. And still doesn't to this day. He will still get up at least once in the night to eat now and sometimes 2 or 3 times if he is not feeling well.    When he was that age he was the same way. Some nights he would sleep 8hrs and others it was every 3-4 hr's and he would wake up HUNGRY even if he just ate 3 hr's ago.    Babies do a lot of growing there first year of life so they have growth spurts and need the extra feedings.    They will never sleep through a feeding if they need food they will wake up. So in my opinion it is very normal for him to be like this at his age.    Congrats on your new lil one :o)|`|AA10079820	It takes a few weeks for them to learn to eat cereal.  Be patient.  Give him a couple of ounces of cereal in his bottle at night to keep him full longer. That's what I did with my daughter.  But all babies sleep through the night at different times.  Mine is 7 months and still doesn't, but I know babies that slept through the night at a few weeks.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This sounds like a pretty normal sleep pattern for a 4 month old to me.  He's hungry, it's normal.  Feed him.
m5N8Ur6Daa	A sperm can lie in wait inside of a woman for up to 6 days in anticipation of an egg.|`|AA10624857	Sperm can live longer than 3 days inside a woman, but the conditions need to be favorable.  Sperm can live as many as 6-7 days.  I guess it depends on what you mean by rare.  You can't always count on the sperm living more than 3 days, but it does happen.  It is a common misconception that sperm doesn't live long outside the body.  Sperm can actually live outside the body as long as it remains wet or the semen hasn't been wiped up (like with a tissue) or washed away.  Air doesn't immediately kill sperm, but it does dry the semen which will kill the sperm.|`|PFO1jxZGaa	yep. usually about 48 hours or so( when its not frozen of course)|`|fLolZCXJaa	inside of the females body it can live weeks but at the most a month. outside of the body it dies within seconds.|`|GZrR0uxjaa	nope i think longer, like 6 or 7 days longer lol...cuz your ovulation period is about that long...if you have a normal cycle anyways...|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	3-5 days honey!|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	It just depends on the guys sperm count and how strong they are. Yes its normal for sperm to live 24-48hours and some live another 1-2 days after that. its very rare to sperm to live past that mark. You have no control on how long they live. If your trying to get pregant have sex on your good days to get th best sperm.     28day cycle day 12-16 but for sure day 14    best of luck

I wish you a speedy, healthy delivery! :)|`|4KXA5oVtaa	Be careful....I'd still call your doctor.  It's very possible they're just braxton hicks.  I get a lot of what feels like cramping myself, (I'm 39 weeks pregnant) however, mine is the stretching of the tendons holding up my uterus, so says my doctor.  I do get pain in my lower abdomen and back and sometimes shooting pains down my legs, ugh, as if pregnant women don't get enough other pains, haha.  Hope you can hang in there!

cY8DgJv5aa	Your mom is right.  Its probably a vein.  Or an ingrown hair.  Or a simple ol' pimple.  Leave it alone.  If it doesn't go away on its own in the next week or so, then you may want to have it checked out by a doctor.|`|SR0hYSqGaa	seriouly i read about this - it turned out to be an alien implant the girl kept having flashbacks until one day she just vanished.

On the other hand its probably a varicose vein|`|hTFQuvnSaa	ewww just wait until it goes away and if it doesnt, go 2 a doctor|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Sounds like a boil.  You can get those under your arm from sweat and so I don't see why you can't get it on your inner thigh if you'd been sweaty in that area lately.  Then again it could just be a pimple or ingrown hair.
nQ7ZcUI3aa	I almost was named Bambi, and I don't think I would like it, it sounds too stripperish, instead I am Brandy.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	My Mother wanted a girl- loved Stevie Nicks at the time (Fleetwood Mac) named me Stephanie.. was never going to be anything else and yes I'm happy with my name!  My favorite names for girls: Audrey, Ella, Chloe.  **your names** Sienna and Weston are my faves and I voted!|`|UbCzA2JVaa	My parents had changed my name a lot when mum was pregnant with me. If I was a boy I might of been called James, which I wouldn't of minded even though it's very common. A name they had liked is Winona with Winnie for a nickname. I would of hated to be called that! No offence to anyone else, but it's just a name I really don't like! I'm glad mum chose Tara, it's not weird, but you don't see many of us!      :)|`|6SwaWSoyaa	If I was a girl my name would have been Alyssa Dawn or Natalie Alexandra. I would have been ok with it.

Also, I was going to be named Hannah.|`|R1cey1Evaa	My name is Rebecca. I was going to be named either Kayleigh or Megan. I like Kayleigh the most, but Rebecca (I go by Becky) suites me better, Kayleigh, Rebecca or Megan does not suite me at all!|`|61c8oevtaa	My parents were set on the name Luca because they wanted to name me after my dad's grandfather. If I was a girl I would have been called Marcella.    My little sister got that name a couple of years later! I wouldn't have minded it. It's very Italian and a lot of people here don't know how to pronounce it. My sister hates it but I think it's a pretty name!    =]|`|fKCWfCviaa	well my mom was throwing around all different kinds of names like lauren and christine. but my dad wouldn't let me be named anything other than elizabeth.|`|hypmxRlJaa	I was supposed to be Olivia Marie instead of Madeline Marie.

They got a girl and named me Melissa.|`|k8pFvtMLaa	I was going to be named Jennifer, but my parents decided at the last second to name me Stephanie. They didn't want my initials to be JJJ, so now I'm SJJ. I honestly cannot see myself as a Jennifer. I'm glad my parents went with Stephanie. I've only ever met 2 others and I've met a lot of Jennifer's.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	my name is   Brianna Michele,  but  I was to be called   Emily Michele    (my dad also liked Ashley - which I LOVE!!)  but, no.. I'm Brianna.    They didnt call me Emily, because my cousin (3 years older) was named Emily.    Emily would have been better   1 because my dads name is Emory(my moms name is Michele)  and I'm more like an Emily than a Brianna    **EDIT!**  If I were a boy, I was to be named  Brett Emory(my brothers name) or Bryan Emory  (i like Brett better)|`|ZiaPbKwaaa	My mom wanted to call me Jamie. Nothing wrong with that. But it my fiance's name lol can you imagine a couple about to get married, both named Jamie !! And then I wouldn't be able to change my last name .... Mrs. Jamie Marks & Ms, Jamie Marks !!!! My dad (god bless him) had her change her mind, and name me Melissa. Destiny, I'd say :) I would have hated that !!|`|lk7iaxqkaa	My dad wanted to name me Erin Rayne, but my mom thought it sounded too much like "Air & Rain"  I DESPISE both of those names, so thankfully I ended up with Alexandra Skye.|`|785684c905911781314e17a1cecdeb2eaa	Giulia (julia)       But my namie is Isabella.

My mom then suggested Alex, and my dad didnt like just Alex, so i am an Alexis.    i love the name natalie, and i am not to fond of alexis.|`|gRnARw6Oaa	If I was a boy, my name would be Jerry after my grandpa. My mom wanted to name me Heidi, but my dad was adamant that Heidi is a dog's name... Not sure where he got that idea. Instead, I ended up as Alicia Jean, Jean was my grandma's name.|`|bzkSIJYnaa	my mom wanted:  Sophia/Sophie, Brittany, Gillian (like Jillian), Jenna, Jamie, Victoria, Vanessa, Brooke.    my dad wanted to name me after a state: like Dakota, Arizona, or Florida. Lol. I like Arizona, I think it suits me. As for my moms names, I like Victoria, Vanessa, and Sophia/Sophie, a lot, but they don't suit me, really.     They settled on Eva (pron. eee-vuh) It was my great-grandmother's name. i love my name :)    edit: I voted on your names: I like Weston Blake & Sailor Jane! So cute! I also love Scarlett and Lorelei, as first names.|`|myw1GBiKaa	I was going to be Jessica but my dad hated it so I ended up with...     Can't tell you, you might be a stalker :)    But no, I would have hated it. It's one of my least favorite names- way too common, so thank you dad!|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I was going to be Alexandra but I couldn't because my cousin (who was born 2 months after me) had already had the name Alexander picked out for him. I would have loved being called Alexandra it's my favorite girl's name right now|`|AA10953999	I was going to be called Jameson lol
Yn2n26zXaa	I woke up to my water breaking at 3:16am three days before my due date. I hadn't had any contractions but when I went to bed that night I felt awful. I thought I was going to be sick. I had to go to the hospital because there was meconium in the water. It took several hours to get my contractions going naturally but I did. I was in labor for 32 hours and in the end I need a c-section. That isn't usual though. |`|AykczQleaa	I was just talking to my cousin this weekend and she told me her story....<br>  <br>  She said it happened about 5am and she said it felt like a water balloon popping in her stomach.  She said she knew it was her water because she felt like she just kept peeing her pants...although not peeing.  She wasn't having any contractions, so she took a shower, did the dishes, and cleaned up the house, knowing that she would be really tired after the baby...She went to the hospital around 9am and they started her on petocin.  She had her son at 5pm that afternoon.  |`|uhZzIVOgaa	my waters broke at 9am with no sign of contractions, got to hospital at 3pm, partner went home at 10pm i was to be induced in the morning, started contracting by myself at 12.30 lost my mucus plug, called the midwife to inform her i was in labour.  4 hours later contrations started getting painful so the6y gave me panadol :(  7.30am contractions getting stronger, midwife comes into induce me, this is the point where i tell her that i had been in labour for 7 hours, she said yea its only early labour and they will have to kick it along. I get mooved to the birth suite at 8am where i discovered the gas :) :) :)  Got assessed and surprise surprise im about to have the baby, luckily my partner got there in time as my daughter was born at 9.50am.  Not very happy with the staff. My daughter was given an IV to administer antibniotics to fight infection which may have been caused by the waters breakiung early.  She wasnt breathing and was in a humidicrib on 50% oxygen for 3 days, then she got out of the crib and just onto moniters for 4 more days. <br>  <br>  Thats my story  :) |`|fRIEHBJOaa	i was due on the 24th...NOTHING<br>  <br>  on the 26th at 5am, i felt like i was getting hardcore period crap. i went to the bathroom to pee. i had a gut feeling THIS WAS IT. i went to go lie in bed when BOOM water. it drizzle down my legs onto the floor. you feel it. it's water. it's like a ballon filled with water POPPED and the water just falls out. i had my baby at 1:18 that same day. |`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Mine started at 2:00am. I went to bed and as soon as I layed down, I felt water. I got up to check and it stopped. I lay back down and it started again. I then called my doctors nurse and she said to go to the hospital. They started pitocin at 3:00am and I had her at 6:12am. She just celebrated her 10th birthday.|`|cCpK6jcHaa	Doing laundry at my friends house and we had just finished eating pizza.  I was changing out the clothes and bent down to pick up basket (it was a big load, LOL), lifted up and felt this urge to go to the bathroom it was like I was going to pee myself.  then I noticed I just kept going (if you know what I mean, LOL) My girlfriend rushed in when I started screaming for her (she had two babies before me so she knew right away)  I finished my clothes and went to the hospital where I wished I had stayed home and swore to never eat pizza again (well maybe for the next couple months, LOL)!!!|`|Y0DZ0977aa	I was bending down to pick something up off of the floor, and I suddenly felt like I was peeing myself!  It wouldn't stop (which no one informed me of!), so I called my husband and my mom and we went to the hospital.  My water broke at 2:00pm the day before my dd.  I ended up needing petocin to help things along, but the best thing about it was they told me that I could get my epidural whenever I wanted it since my water already broke!  So with that first bad contraction, I called for it, and I barely felt a thing!  I had my little boy at 2:12 am on his due date!   There were no complications, and I hope this labor goes the same as well!|`|dvivgFcLaa	My waters broke at 8.30am on the saturday morning. Felt like a lil pop like a bubble bursting inside your vagina and felt like i was constantly peein my pants and couldnt stop it and it was clear and not yellow like normal wee.
IFqY2w1Paa	Those symptoms do not determine pregnancy, and neither does pushing your stomach. If you were pregnant, you wouldn't be able to see or feel it yet - your uterus is still behind your pubic bone.    To answer your questions:  1) The "water squishy noise" could just be extra fluid you're feeling. You might be bloated from constipation.  2) It could have been the dried lube.  3) Yes, but it's highly unlikely that some of it got on the condom. I wouldn't worry too much about it. If you did get pregnant, it would be *most likely* from pre-ejaculation from the condom failing.  4) Yes, it's too soon to test. Wait until a missed period for the best result.  5) If you think you got pregnant from last month or November, then yes, a blood test would pick it up - BUT a urine test would have picked it up by now, too. Since you have gotten 7 negative tests, I would say you are not pregnant.  6) Yes, it's too soon to have symptoms. Most do not show up until the 6th to 8th week of pregnancy.  7) Your tests have a chance of being wrong, but it's most likely an accurate result.    Frequently urinating can come from plenty of things. You might have a bladder infection, or you just need to drink more water. Sharp pains in your stomach are not an indication or pregnancy.|`|nUu7tUiqaa	You are likely not pregnant. You took many home pregnancy tests and they showed up negative, so it is very unlikely that you are pregnant. The watery noise is probably just water weight gain, or bloating. The odds of two different brands showing a false negative is very little. If it shows up negative, then it is more than likely negative. My advice is that you are stressing yourself out and your mind is making you think you have pregnancy symptoms. I doubt you are pregnant, but if you want to be sure, go to the doctor and get a test. It takes only a few minutes to get a professional test.|`|hTFQuvnSaa	don't squish ur stomach cuz u will kill ur baby and stop having so much sex
eiEzaPBJaa	wow! I felt the same way when I found out my 2nd was a girl I was absolutely convinced she was going to be a boy. When I told my husband it was another girl he  was very disappointed too but got over it because it faster than I did.  the whole pregnancy I believed I would have a boy even after 3 ultra sounds. when I actually gave birth I had no name picked out and refused to name her. my husband ended up picking the name 8 hours after she was born! I felt awful that I wanted a boy and it took me 6-8 months to actually bond with her. she is 11 months now and I cant imagine life with out her! I always loved her but I didnt really like her. Now that I look back I know I missed out on a lot of love that she gave. <br>  <br>  with this being your first baby Im sure that the whole process of the birth will be so amazing to you that you will be overcome with joy when she arrives.|`|G4Wqyg4faa	Honestly I think when you see the baby your feelings will change.  This is a living, breathing person who's grown inside you. It's pretty normal for your emotions to be all over the place while you're pregnant anyway.<br>  As for the pink hell, don't worry. I hate pink too.....but theres enough girls clothes out there in other pretty colors that we won't have to suffer (if I have a girl, I don't know yet).<br>  I hope you feel better soon.|`|6mXYVsibaa	Girls are defiantly more difficult. i got two of each. And even though my girls drive me crazy with their attitude i still love em to death. i guess what i'm trying to say is if this is your first don't be so down about it.you can have a boy next time you never know.. the baby can tell your feelings even now. try to just be happy youv'e been blessed with a real little person there. love her with all your heart and she will love you too.|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	Just be glad that the baby is healthy! I was ecstatic when I found out I was having a girl. My little princess. I can't believe you would be so upset!|`|X3d2w8a9aa	My partner was really really down when he found out his first children were both girls. He really wanted a boy. What made it worse is after this last pregnancy I can't have anymore kids so he will never get his boy (unless god forbid we break up in the future) As soon as he saw his babies he melted and loved them. For a month he was still really down about no boys, but after a few months he has come to terms with the blessings he has and he is the proudest daddy ever :D|`|r7iXI5fKaa	Hi, Trust me, when you've had her, your feelings will change. You'l have this overwhelming feeling of love when you hold her & she's looking at you. <br>  You don't have to have her in pink, I hate girls that are covered in pink frills!!!<br>  My daughter is always in neutral, maybe the odd top with red or something.  Just look around.<br>  Congrats on your little girl! At least she's healthy. Thats the main thing.<br>  13 weeks with my 5th!|`|cxarSDPsaa	you'll warm up to the idea soon enough. Just remember you can't take it out on the baby, it wasn't her choice, and think of it as a life long friend who will never leave you.<br>  <br>  C'mon isn't all that girl talk sound exciting?|`|Pn2tu1Xsaa	it's not bad to be disappointed,but for a short term only,cause you'll get stressed.....|`|wENdWT5kaa	It's normal. Don't feel guilty. But your feelings will change the second you see her face. :)|`|8v40KEd0aa	I'm sure you will fall in love with her the first time you see  her, I did with my first born son. I wanted a girl both times and had two boys. I wouldn't trade them for the world. They are healthy and nice people. That's all I ever asked from them is to be sweet and nice to others. My sister had two girls and two boys which I love as my own. So I get to do girlie things with them. You should be excited. Just remember she didn't choose to be here. Please don't take it out on her that she's not a boy. I'll be thinking of you and good luck!
s8VgyzE2aa	Hmmm I just posted a question about this LOL<br>  <br>  I have 4 boys and we call their privates what they are a penis and testicles. I think it's important to use correct terms.<br>  <br>  If I had a girl I would also use correct terms. I would call it a vulva and as she got older I would get into the specific parts such as a clitoris, labia and vagina which is actually on the inside. <br>  <br>  I think it's great that they are going to be teaching children correct terms. It's about time they do so in the future women especially can know what their own parts are called.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Hi! I'm in Canada. I think when children learn names for body parts, like an arm, a knee, a foot - they should also be learning the proper names for others - boys have a penis and testicles; girls have a vulva, a vagina - overall name, a pudenda; women have breasts. We did that with our son. <br>  It's just matter-of-fact; I think it's silly to have slang names for them. However, it's good to teach an overall name for them - 'private parts' is very common.<br>  |`|UhAHaOWFaa	I don't think 5 year olds need to know this!<br>  <br>  This country is going mad!!!!!!!!|`|YBQvzEhGaa	We just call them our privates. |`|pDGVTLoFaa	As a parent of four grown children I did not and would not allow sex education at five it is inappropriate at such a young age what is it in society today that forces adulthood on children that are innocent,I want to weep.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Well I have 3 younger brothers, and now a son of my own.<br>  My brothers all used the term "peanut" when they were young.<br>  <br>  When I was younger I used the term "privates" or "my private".<br>  <br>  I call my sons a peanut also.|`|igPBuDHkaa	i tell her its her little women but she says its her other bum lol <br>  am from northern ireland i was always told its my auntie annie lol <br>  <br>  and if i had a boy i would tell him his was a little man <br>  and if he touched it <br>  it will fall off haha only kidding |`|eCJKbAbXaa	We use the correct names in our house but my daughter has picked up calling it a 'wendy' from somewhere.

I see no need for silly made up names.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	Girls are tricky...<br>  <br>  Penis and Testicles is fine, but a girls parts are made up of several parts that all kinda look the same and some can't even be seen or don't really have a function without talking about sexual pleasure which is not a topic for children imo.<br>  <br>  When i was a child it was a tuppence and as far i was aware when i said that everyone knew what i meant and therefore it was the correct term for it.<br>  <br>  I presume they'll be wanting to call it a Vagina, but they can't even see their vagina as it is internal... so are they really going to go into the vulva, clitoris, labia etc and how are they going to explain what they are in a way that a child will understand...|`|gSwobfujaa	guys- willie, peter, junior, peck, rod, wang, peepee<br>  <br>  girls- vag, vuh-jayjay, vuh-jhean, privates<br>  <br>  there are a lot more names for men then women here..lol. the womens names are a playful version of the real word where men have comical names the typically have nothing to do with their actual part...except for rod. lol hope i could help :-)<br>  <br>  id like to add that some people are taking this subject way too seriously. the genitals are private..and is a "touchy" topic to talk about. it always has been and it always will be. so using playful and less direct words is not harming children. and its not like they grow up not knowing what a penis is! they know what it is..they prefer to use a more comfortable term for it. i dont understand why people are freaking out about it. making "nicknames" does not teach children to be ashamed-thats just ridiculous!! it has nothing to do with being a responsable parent either. the real problem here is people teaching sex ed to children who dont need to know anything about that business yet...they are too young. once they start growing pubes THEN they should learn...because around that age is when they want to learn and are ready to understand. and i think thats a valid point.|`|5507858478baac68ed69511bef8b1860aa	i think its good children get taught the biological names, uses etc for their sexual parts but also when a bit older i do think we need to have relationship guidance etc, about love, relationships, sex and when its the right time, not waiting till your married crap etc but waiting till your in a proper rel. and how sex changes your relationship. and obviousely precautions, sti`s and contraception!|`|uRImc3Qnaa	how funny you asked that recently we had a similar problem we have boys.<br>  <br>  So we always call it the Pee Pee, but recently he racked himself on his bike, and couldn't explain what hurt.<br>  <br>  So now we have a penis, and balls which are the testicals.  His balls hurt and one was stuck up inside his pee pee, we had to have that looked at because it didn't drop back down after two hours.<br>  <br>  So now the 2 year old knows the correct names eventhough they prefer balls to testicals.|`|N2JkgQ4Uaa	I think that children SHOULD be taught a proper sex education but I don't think I would want my son or daughter using words "Vagina" or "Penis" at the age of five... it just doesn't seem right.... I think willy for penis is far more acceptable for a five-year-old boy<br>  <br>  and a girl should be "Girly bits" "Rose bud" or "Sayuri" I just think there are some words you want to hear from children and some you don't....

Why is it so taboo to call a vagina "a vagina"??????

They should start doing that here in the US (it doesn't start until around the 5th grade-like 10 or 11 year olds). anyway, to answer your question, i'm like you, i call it her girl parts but her father gets mad. he says it makes her sound like a robot. lol|`|Q12hhjKXaa	I don't call mine anything, really.<br>  It's my vagina and I use that word when its needed (e.g.: doctors).<br>  <br>  As for a little girl, though, I have friends who get their girls to call them:<br>  'Tuppence'<br>  'Minnie'<br>  'Minnie-Moo'<br>  'Floo'<br>  'Floozy'<br>  'Special Bits' (<not sure I like that one!)|`|OuuYoSBeaa	the reason for the nicknames, in my opinion is comfortability. i personally, am not comfortable for some reason or another using the proper names. to my kids, its a whohaa, or pee pee...<br>  my daughter know the proper name, i dont need to use it though.|`|AA11447866	We call my sons a boy part.

That's completely stupid, and your children will be exploited by their lack of knowledge. |`|bcGFSjsraa	for boys for me there were a ton of them!  wiener, thingy, tally-whacker, ding dong...etc.<br>  for girls my mom always called hers a bobo or a hoohoo |`|79b86bc0fefd71d48ae9e6b514422fd1aa	My daughter is 5 and she called a penis *Ducky* ... funny story behind it, my step son is 15 but at the time he was 12 I think and he had these boxers with a duck on the pocket of the front of the boxers.  Well one evening he came out of the shower with just boxers on, he did something (jumped or something) and his penis came out of the pocket and my 2 year old at the time, saw it and yelled "DUCKY!!!"  So the name stuck.  But she knows the proper word for it but enjoys ducky<br>  <br>  For girls ... eh she calls it a Va-J-J thanks to my 17 year old step daughter.  Not to happy about that one and trying to break it lol Step daughter and son were wrestling one night and he kicked her in that area and she yelled "You kicked me in my Va-J-J!"  my 5 year old thought it was soooo funny and now she uses it :(|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I have two boys and we call them a penis and testicles in our home. <br>  <br>  My best friend still calls her parts a va-jay-jay.

If they go tell their teacher/ family member/ friend/ parent and use a slang term, that person may not have a clue what they are talking about and think nothing of it.|`|AkFag8tNaa	 I have two boys and I've always had them call it penis.

FQ4nhSiRaa	We live where it is cold also, so I put a warm sleeper on my son and then a wearable blanket. No loose blankets they could pull them over their head. I also am paranoid and still check my baby all the time while sleeping. His crib is right next to my bed. It is recommended that the baby be in a separate but close to you sleeping arrangement. Then your breathing helps regulate his.|`|52bAHCaUaa	Here's one site I found for the monitor:     http://www.securebaby.com/baby_monitors_...    http://reviews.pricegrabber.com/baby-mon...    Theres two different ones...I googled "baby movement sensor" and came up with a lot. They all seem to be about the same though! :) Good luck!! You're Welcome!    I thought I found a different one that was a bit cheaper...I'll keep looking!    ~~~~~~~~~  I think everything else you are doing sounds perfect! But perhaps a monitor of some sort will also help ease your mind. My daughter was born 12 weeks premature, so she came home on an apnea monitor. I loved that thing! It went off twice for us...so I was terrified when they took it away! But apparently she doesn't need it anymore!|`|PFO1jxZGaa	What you are doing sound fine. And since he was full term his chances are lower for sids than in premature babies.   I know its scary, I actually would poke my first baby occasionally to see if he was still breathing, once I even put a mirror under his nose :) But he sounds fine and I doubt he;ll have a problem. It is very rare|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	My little girl sleeps with me or in the crib by the bed. because I also freak out every now and then.  I know it's a scary thought.  if your baby is healthy and you are doing things right and are being safe don't worry.|`|oXzHvsBpaa	You can also run a fan at night. There was a recent study done. In some studies it reduced the risk of SIDS up to 40% in some studies. We run a fan at night around the room.    They do make movement monitors. We don't have one just because our son sleeps in his swing at night in our room but I have heard some very good things about them. Basically if your baby stops moving for any amount of time it will go off. I think its a great idea if it will put your mind at ease. His a link to one of them.    http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...    I also have a friend who lost her daughter to SIDS at 4 weeks old. In case someone says that it doesn't happen.

AA10624857	Official parent teacher conferences are offered in October and January in our school district.  Parent teacher conferences are really not beneficial at the end of the school year as they are designed to discuss a student's progress.  These are the times when parents and teachers can touch base, discuss successes as well as areas needing work.  At the end of the school year, it is too late to work on problem areas.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	two.  november and april (i think.  maybe march).  i'd love if we had another.|`|bfjs9wSLaa	1 is required in california, and then more if your child is in risk of being retained.|`|1gF9QVy9aa	Parent-teacher conferences are set up at four points of the year and generally revolve around the release of report cards each quarter, at least in my district. Many parents do not take advantage of them though.  My students that struggle the most have parents who complain about their child's grades, but I never see them for P/T conferences.  To each his own, I guess.      As far as the most appropriate times for the conferences....as a teacher, there is never a "right" time from my experience.  Some kids do beautifully until mid-year, some struggle until the end and some have no difficulty at all all year.  It truly depends on the individual student as to how many conferences are the right amount and at what points in the year.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	I live in the UK and we have a parents evening in October for a general progress talk then I've got one next week where we also get to view their work, they then get their end of year report in the summer so it's two times a year I get to speak with the teacher, I think that's sufficient.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	We had 1 in November but dont have any other sched as of yet.

3klIx1Egaa	It takes about half an hour before the alcohol starts to get into your milk, so while you are having a drink at home or just before would probably be safe if you have eaten something recently. Of course, a weaker drink would mean less alcohol in your system, but be aware that as long as the alcohol is in your blood, it is also in your milk. Just make sure you aren't feeling the effects of the drink before you nurse. If you are impaired in any way by the alcohol, it's in your milk and will affect your baby.     You say that you want to go out and have a couple drinks and mention pumping and dumping. You should know that alcohol in your milk doesn't remain there. It works the same as it does in your blood. Once the alcohol is out of your blood, it's also out of your milk. So only pump if you are going to miss a couple of nursings and want to keep up your supply or to relieve any engorgement you might have while you are away from your baby. You can also pump before you drink if you want to have some milk on hand to feed your baby if you feel like you're still going to be intoxicated at the next feeding. Don't think you have to do it because alcohol is going to stay in your milk long after you've been drinking. You don't have to get rid of any milk. It doesn't work that way.     Another thing that you should watch out for, according to La Leche League International, is your baby's age. Because your baby is 2 months old, liver function is more limited than in an older baby, so even a small amount of alcohol could tax your baby's liver. At around 3 months of age, however, your baby would process any alcohol more quickly, more like an adult's liver would. Before that, however, babies process alcohol at about half the rate of adults.     All that said, know that as long as you aren't sucking down Jell-O shots and then nursing your baby, the occasional beer with your pizza or glass of wine with your bubble bath now and then shouldn't be avoided like the plague. Experts like Dr. Jack Newman, author of The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers (Compare Prices) are working hard to dispel these myths. Nursing while you are drunk or frequently nursing when you've been drinking -- those are problems. But, according to Newman, "Reasonable alcohol intake should not be discouraged at all ... Prohibiting alcohol is another way we make life unnecessarily restrictive for nursing mothers."|`|u12eVaDhaa	Your body clears your breasts of alcohol in the same way it does your blood so you don't need to 'pump and dump' as has been previously believed.  If you had 2 or 3 units of alcohol you can feel now.  If you had a lot more then just work on the basis of one hour per unit to get it out of your bloodstream (and breasts).  I should think you can recommence feeding pretty much immediately if you slept last night and haven't drunk anything today.    Best wishes|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If you are sober enough to care for your child you are sober enough to breastfeed.  Its a redundant rule really.    Pumping and dumping will not get the alcohol out of your milk any faster.  Alcohol leaves your milk as soon as it leaves your blood, and only 2% of your blood alcohol level appears in your milk (so if your blood alcohol level is 0.08% your breastmilk is 0.0016% alcohol).      http://www.kellymom.com/health/lifestyle...  Breastfeeding and Alcohol    By Kelly Bonyata, IBCLC  Guidelines        * Current research says that occasional use of alcohol (1-2 drinks) is not harmful to the nursing baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs classifies alcohol (ethanol) as a Maternal Medication Usually Compatible With Breastfeeding.      * Many experts recommend against drinking more than 1-2 drinks per week.      * It is recommended that nursing moms avoid breastfeeding during and for 2-3 hours after drinking (Hale 2002).      * There is no need to pump & dump milk after drinking alcohol, other than for mom's comfort -- pumping & dumping does not speed the elimination of alcohol from the milk.      * Alcohol does not increase milk production, and has been shown to inhibit let-down and decrease milk production (see below).      * If you're away from your baby, try to pump as often as baby usually nurses (this is to maintain milk supply, not because of the alcohol). At the very least, pump or hand express whenever you feel uncomfortably full - this will help you to avoid plugged ducts and mastitis.    In general, if you are sober enough to drive, you are sober enough to breastfeed. Less than 2% of the alcohol consumed by the mother reaches her blood and milk. Alcohol peaks in mom's blood and milk approximately 1/2-1 hour after drinking (but there is considerable variation from person to person, depending upon how much food was eaten in the same time period, mom's body weight and percentage of body fat, etc.). Alcohol does not accumulate in breastmilk, but leaves the milk as it leaves the blood; so when your blood alcohol levels are back down, so are your milk alcohol levels.    Always keep in mind the baby's age when considering the effect of alcohol. A newborn has a very immature liver, so minute amounts of alcohol would be more of a burden. Up until around 3 months of age, infants detoxify alcohol at around half the rate of an adult. An older baby or toddler can metabolize the alcohol more quickly.

DDFSITiYaa	Welllllll <br>  I guess before I had ALLOWED my child (minor) to buy such an item, I would have laid down some ground rules about use and violations involving their use.  <br>  <br>  But if not, then I'd have to say that while I wouldn't take it away, I could render it inoperable.  For example, if I paid for gas for the car then that would be shut off or I could simply ground my son and he could not go anywhere - or take his license. .  For the laptop, unless my daughter provides her own internet, perhaps I'd disconnect it for her laptop.  <br>  <br>  Bottom line is that there has to be consequence to their actions. |`|h1lDGNp4aa	Yes, I would.  You are still their parent and they live in your household.  A child needs to know that there are consequences to their actions and they can learn it best by taking away from them something which is important.  Since they bought the car and the laptop it's safe to say how important they are.<br>  <br>  But when you're depriving them of the use of them be sure to tell them that they need to learn how to be responsible and that misusing them is not acceptable to you.  <br>  <br>  Keep them for a week.  If they show they're responsible then, fine.  If not, keep them for two weeks, etc.|`|Nyjck3Utaa	It's HIS car that he bought. It's his, so you have no right (or authority) to take it away.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	if she paid/pays for it totally on her own you have no right to take it away|`|31b2e0be9602463765e8be412e53000faa	As a parent it is not only your right, but your responsibility to restrict your child's privileges if they are acting in an inappropriate way.  It does not matter if they purchased the car or the laptop themselves.  You are restricting the action of utilizing these items, not stealing them from your child. <br>  <br>  In addition, a child should NEVER have access to the internet on a computer that is behind closed doors, PERIOD!  It's not being paranoid or untrusting...it is parenting for the good of your child.|`|d8023b2fabb3330b02673c650f1b5c8baa	I would definitely take the car away.  If you  are not responsible enough to get your *** in the door by curfew and you live under my roof, then hell ya.  These are house rules, especially for teenagers. <br>  <br>  I would also take away her laptop because that is a safety factor. If she cannot use it responsibly then she cannot have it. If she is up all night what happens to her schoolwork or her job.  Lesson learned|`|b4c89c2db999aecaa0827f695bacb1bfaa	If that particular item is responsible for an incident, yes.<br>  <br>  An old wives tales says, keep them poor.  <br>  Sometimes they do not know how to handle money well.  Kids have rights when the keep they 10 commandments. Honor your father and mother.<br>  <br>  <br>  The law says you can if they are under your roof and under the age of 18 years of age.  Somewhere it is written about under aged driving and parents responsibilities.  page 24/43 is about drinking and driving under the age.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/publications/pdf_publications/dsd_a11811.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberdriveillinois.com/public...</a>  Look up page 24.|`|VtW9Kddeaa	I honestly dont think you have the power to take things away that they paid for, unless you had some part in buying it.  if you are at all involved in the purchase then yes i think you have a right.  if its the one about a labtop, just make it a rule that it stays in the kitchen or living room at nite, or possibly your own room would be the best choice, therefore you wouldnt have ne sneaking going around|`|Jd8lkPBjaa	Absolutely....a punishment is meant to PUNISH.<br>  <br>  For her safety I would absolutely take the laptop out of her room. However I would allow her to keep it in a centralized location where I knew she would not be talking to strangers on the internet. Common safety sense.|`|LOULq171aa	if they purchased it with their own money, you shouldn't take it away, unless it is a serious offense. i would probably take away privileges with those things though, like limiting time on the computer or the times the car could be driven. |`|TjLrQemeaa	No I wouldn't. If they bought it it is their property and I have no right to take it away! If I bought it, then yes I would take away.|`|q16iJ6PSaa	Absolutely.....if they're under 18, they're still the parent's responsibility. It doesn't matter who paid for it. |`|8qw0Cdqiaa	No, I would not take something away from my child that s/he paid for with his/her own money.<br>  <br>  If my son missed his curfew then it's time to revisit the time of the curfew itself.  I'd have my son come up with some consequences for missing it again and then follow through.<br>  <br>  If my daughter was on her own computer and using it inappropriately then I'd tell her that she could only use it in the kitchen where she can be supervised.|`|wBpennsMaa	No, as that item doesn't belong to me. 
AA12033653	Well first of all, the hair down there in general grows at a faster rate than any other hair on your body.  Second, the prenatal vitamins that you should be taking, make your hair and nails grow faster and in some cases thicker.  That being said, welcome to uncontrollable down there hair.      I have a great trimmer that I use to remove the bulk, then my Hubby shaves the rest for me.  It makes for some fun foreplay LOL.      Good Luck and Congrats on your pregnancy.|`|hTFQuvnSaa	LOL!!! cant help u there...|`|tbeO3Lataa	Very normal. It's the hormones that come along with pregnancy. (What to Expect When Your Expecting details it. If you don't already have that book, get it!).    I know, not fun. But hey, did you know that a recent study discovered that hairier women orgasm easier during sex? I'm not kidding! Something to do with the hormones.    Anyway, kudos on the pregnancy!|`|98WKYtfwaa	it's the hormones causing the hair to grow.     i'm the same, i used to shave down there every 4days and now i need to do it every 2nd day, i'm also getting it in places i never had too.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Its normal, youre going to get more hair in weird places. Trim it now while you can still reach it lol soon you wont be able to!|`|wiAVa1H5aa	You mean your pubic hair?   Well, during pregnancy the follicles don't turn over as often and stay in your skin growing for longer periods of time - so hairs that were short get long and noticeable.   They'll shed about 3-4 months after you deliver, until then find some joy in being a real woman with magnificent pubic hair.  (You're pregnant!   It's okay!   Honestly, you have bigger things to worry about...)|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Thank the hormones!!!  I'm 16 weeks too and thought it was just me.  I went crazy on the internet trying to figure this out because its on my belly too (not thick but I never had hair there!).  Apparently this is nature's little joke on those that are preggers.|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Its just like the hair on your head. Lovely prenatals make most of it grow (my leg hair has almost stopped growing, yay!!)|`|jNgh3e3Faa	http://www.babycenter.com.sg/pregnancy/l...      Yes, it is normal. Pregnancy rocks.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yeah hormones! just like ur hair grows on ur head like crazy during pregnancy .. it happens all over utr body|`|EAeffKqSaa	LOL : )    Well look at this way if you have a man around the house and you can trust him to "shave" you, it just might "turn" him on and might lead to some pretty hot sex.   Hey it works for us.  Plus when your tummy gets big it'll be hard to see it down there.     Good luck to you, congrats on the baby.|`|83341f44c00d0863eafb9c7c6a1709d7aa	Your hair growth can be contributed from your pregnancy hormones. It is very same to keep trimming down there as you were before.|`|cSm1zod4aa	lol... unfortunately its completely normal. Mine is growing soooo fast... don't be surprised if you get hair in many other strange places either. Its those lovely hormones! lol I got black hair all over my tummy...lol... don't worry though its supposed to go away after pregnancy... best of luck mama!!

You're almost there :)|`|X6as2nOAaa	it is totally normal sleep and rest when you want he can take care of the rest while you are tired he should not be annoyed by it.

I kept trying to, and it was HORRIBLE. Sleep when you need to. I keep getting five minutes of energy here and there, but then my hips hurt too bad to finish it!    I can't even go grocery shopping.

IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL|`|AA10079820	It's normal.  Your body needs rest for the big day. So take some naps. Watch a movie. Whatever.    You'll probably start nesting in a couple of weeks and have a big burst of energy.|`|nXPJ6d7eaa	You're carrying another life inside you. It's pretty tiring. I think your husband would probably rather that you and your baby don't over-exert yourselves whilst cleaning. In other words: the cleaning is not as important as you and your baby, and your husband may be annoyed, but don't let that make you feel guilty. Are his legs painted on? Then why doesn't he do it himself?   You are going through one of the most extreme changes the body can go through. Do what you can handle. Sometimes, if I tried to do too much in my third trimester, I would get strange aches and pangs from different stomach muscles, then spend the rest of the day worrying about my baby.   Cleaning can wait til 6 months after the baby is born, and it generally does lol...  Keep your eyes on the prize, and prepare yourself for the arrival of your child. Don't stress about housework or whether or not your husband is frustrated or annoyed at your behaviour imo.   Congrats and good luck for the big day. Take it easy. Have a foot bath and forget the cleaning ;)
IBbcW2laaa	Oh man! That can't feel to good. you should get one of those stress balls. They are so relaxing.|`|ADCbRlbeaa	EW    sorry i hate blood haha  I use to bite my arm when I was little...but my friend slapped my arm and told me to stop          i stopped...she slaps harder then i bite.|`|BSockNx7aa	yeah thats not good.  and it's good you relize that its bad.  maybe a stress ball.  and it's no fun to be depressed.  maybe talk to your mom/dad  about counseling.  :)|`|1tajpIXXaa	Seek help.|`|baEs4ZcJaa	Punch / scream into your pillow (:|`|szlDgnJmaa	get a stress ball|`|M5nCDbdhaa	hahaa ''so anyways,yes yes''  i alreday love you xD    hmm....well...do u like looking like that? i bet no, so why do it?  try the nails,they taste WAY better :P    orrr my mate found it much better to get one of those stress relief balls and squeeze them in class.    p.s everyone gets emotional and no,not  emo style :P  but we're human so its totally normal.Screaming into the pillow works sometimes....but i just pack a bag and go boxing to the gym(helps MUCH more) but some ppl dont have the fast facilities as i do so home stuff helps,like the pillow.|`|RKQTD9Dhaa	It sounds like you have social anxiety or issues handling stress.  You should just talk to your doctor about referring you to a counselor.  Counseling can be a good thing.  In no way does it mean you are crazy.  A counselor is like a friend and mentor who you can trust to keep your secrets (they are bound by law) and give you good advice (it's their job).|`|LbNXxRXnaa	Ouuchh! Sounds painful ://     I have really bad anxiety, so when I get really stressed I don't really show it. It kind of all builds up then I end up crying and getting reaallyyy angry. Yeahh not good.     Maybe you could get stress ball or something. That way when you get stressed you could squeeze it really hard. Or listen to music, draw, read a book, stuff like that. Think happy thoughts!! :D     ?Ash
S9tilPJMaa	The child that I put up for adoption will be turning 21 next month. I have recently thought a lot about this question. <br>  <br>  I have curiosity. I would be interested to see what kind of a man he is today. I would be interested to see if he looks like me. I do not have an empty place that can only be filled by a reunion. If he did search for me, I think that I would meet him. Right now I do not have the desire to search for him. I don't know if that would change in the future or not. It's not that I prefer no contact, but if he never searched for me, I would not be hurt by that. <br>  <br>  Edit: vmarie misunderstands me. I have nothing but love for the child that I put up for adoption. Just the same way that I would for the children I am raising, I would lay down my life for him. I relinquished my parental rights because of love.  He has not searched for me, so I am unable to say how I would feel in that situation. I can only guess. If he did search, would I meet him? Yes. Do I have the desire for a "family" relationship with him, celebrating holidays together and such? Probably not. He has his family. If he did not search for me I would take it to mean that his life is full enough to not have the need. Maybe that's just me being dreamy. I don't know, but that's how I like to think of it. Again, like so many people say, if you haven't been through it, you don't know. I haven't been through it, I don't know. All I can share is my experience and how I feel TODAY. Ask me tomorrow it might be different.<br>  <br>  As far as information goes. I would love nothing more than to be able to explain my reasons for adoption. I knew at the time that I was not able to parent a child. Now I am the mother of a 12 and 14 year old. I am even more aware of not being able to parent at the time of the adoption. Medical info: at the time of the adoption I (with MY mother) filled out medical info for the AP. If more medical info were needed, I would fly around the world to get the info to whomever needed it. <br>  <br>  vmarie - you imply in your response that I am selfish. Giving a child for adoption is the most UN-selfish thing I have ever done. It is not a secret in my family.|`|hITgLl1maa	im not being rude or judgemental...i respect whoever has been through this situation as there are different circumstances in every case...<br>  but how could you give a baby up for adoption and then want to have contacts with him/her afterwards? the whole point of giving up a child is to have nothing to do it with anymore, for a reason or another...so whats the point in trying to get back in touch years later?<br>  please dont misunderstand my answer|`|XyU6oEVPaa	Since your child is now 35, you were a part of the EMS/BSE, and had virtually no alternative without your parent's or your boyfriend's support.  So,these cruel and judgmental responses questioning your "choice"  and stating their firm belief in their own superior ability to resist forces they are clueless about really need to study their history since it is on the brink of repeating. <br>  <br>  I lost my son in 1967,  and we have been reunited since 1990.  I became pregnant on or around my 18th birthday.  I "knew" that he would find me, and had a collapse when he didn't within a year of his 18th birthday. I later discovered it was due to the agency so it wasn't his fault.  Nevertheless, the fact that he didn't and I thought that I would never know him destroyed my carefully constructed house of cards. I had lived a regular life, but it was always in the back of my mind, and it affected every aspect of my life until we reunited.  I didn't even realize the impact it had until about 10 years into reunion.  <br>  <br>  Yes, I would want contact. I told myself I wanted to know that he was alive.  I told myself that I wanted to know that he was healthy. I told myself that I wanted to know what he looked like.  All those things were the truth, but not the whole truth, which I didn't discover until reunion.  Early on, I was obsessed with him.  That level of intensity cannot be maintained for long.  But, I wanted more after reunion.  However, he is a very troubled man, and I finally have come to a place where I now know that he is alive  and if not exactly well, he is able to make choices for himself.  So, I am way farther ahead, despite the pain of reuniting myself with the girl who went away as well as the son I bore and lost, than I was prior to reunion.  I guess in a way adoption still is my motivating force, but yes,it was well worth it.  To me, not knowing has always been the purest form of torture.  Now I know.  It is better.  I hope that this was helpful to you.  <br>  <br>  One little side note, I hope that if you are considering finding or are reunited that you will join a group of mothers.   There are some really good ones online, and it is a huge comfort to communicate with women who share your experience and know without explanations what you are feeling.  That more than anything else helped me toward healing.  If you haven't found one, I can give you some links to some very good ones.  <br>  <br>  It is very much worth it. <br>  Sandy Young<br>  Reunited Senior Mother|`|7DWy8mPZaa	I would like to see how they've grown and to just be peace of mind and that little bit of reassurance I think you'd be craving as the birth Mother hoping that they'd been given a great life so far.|`|AA12030056	im adopted, my mother never wanted contact with me, my nan did and my auntie, but then when i met them they were a real waste of time since they met me once and then never wanted to meet me again|`|yUyx2nhmaa	I don't think anyone could answer that unless they'd been in the situation. It's up to the person and the circumstances.|`|RrgQUT5vaa	I would hope that I would have had continued contact and didn't have to start at the age of 35.|`|yEzCKWzEaa	Yes, of course I would want contact.|`|AA11179887	MimiEllie &Peanut's answer was upseting to me, b/c they didn't even sound like they have feeling toward the child they gave up for adoption.  I think it's sad when people don't agree to meeting with their child.  I think every child deserves to know who the person is that gave them life.  We have no history or medical records to pass down to our own children.  I believe that if you child does find you God is blessing you with a second chance to know that child and you shouldn't turn them away. No matter what the circumstances surrounding their adoption were everyone deserves the truth.  It's the secrecy and lies surrounding adoption that cause all the pain for everyone.  I would imagine anyone that does thumb down my answer does not want to meet their child.|`|B0unm8ZFaa	To be completly honest with you this has happened to me, I was 19 years old and something happened to me and it led to me getting pregnant instead of abortion I gave her up for adoption, I dont believe in abortion so I feel I did the right thing. I have an open adoption though I get pictures, letters all sorts of things. But when she turns 18 years old she can come and find me if she wishes to do so... I know it will be hard on her but if she wants to she always can.|`|Ru4CSc1raa	Yes, I would. At least I would like to have the chance to meet my child and make up for lost time if it turned out to be that I regretted my decision later. Even if I do not regret my decision at a time, I would like to have the certainty that my birth child is doing well in life. There are so  many reasons, Yes, Yes, Yes, I'd like to be contacted.|`|BH9MoOQAaa	Seriously?  Why do people who never relinquished a child for adoption answer these questions?!?<br>  <br>  96% of women who relinquished a child for adoption want reunion.<br>  <br>  Please ignore the ignorant who start their answers with "I would never give my baby up..."|`|dBXSdk5Taa	i would like him/her to get in touch but i wouldn't blame them if they didn't.<br>  hope this helps good luck.|`|lkHpib0Yaa	Absolutely! My son is in my life again after a 22 year separation.|`|ZaHXcoWqaa	I live and breathe for the day my son finds me, or the day I find him. |`|QYoKfJcbaa	yes |`|OXNiEDROaa	My son will be 22 in December.  I patiently wait to see if he wants to meet me and his little brother or not.  If he does not, I am ready to accept it.  If he does, I can't wait to meet him.  Haven't seen him since he was 5 days old.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Yes, I found my daughter when she was almost 30. We were both happy to be found.|`|7JEojMgQaa	I briefly scanned the answers you got and since I was in that position I feel QUALIFIED to answer.<br>  <br>  BUT FIRST let me address a few issues I have.<br>  <br>  You don't know what you'd do until you have been there. PERIOD<br>  <br>  You can talk all you want about what you wouldn't do and how you'd go about making other arrangements but bottom line, IF THOSE OPTIONS WERE AVAILABLE WE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN THEM TOO.<br>  <br>  People lie, so to say that you would only do it IF you had some sort of control (which is what you are saying) is to fool yourself, just ask the mothers from all the opened adoption that have been closed.<br>  <br>  I assume that some would watch their child STARVE, or be MOLESTED, AND EVENTUALLY RAPED as opposed to taking a chance on strangers.<br>  <br>  YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'D DO so stop talking like you have insight to something you have never had to face.<br>  <br>  Answer to question:<br>  <br>  YES, I always wanted contact and I got it. I have a great relationship with my daughter. She CHOOSES to have a relationship with me. Just in case there is anyone who feels I DON'T DESERVE. I most certainly do. I kept my part of the bargain and the proper amount of time has passed and I DO deserve. Just like any other parent who is in my position and not yours. <br>  <br>  What you people do to other men and women who are in this situation is condescending and hateful. Your self appointed superiority over others shows you have never had to face this kind of hardship. <br>  <br>  If it were your only option to keep your child alive or safe you would hand your child over to stranger. You may not know that but I DO. That is if you loved that child at all. <br>  <br>  Try it and then come back and tell me all about it. <br>  <br>  To those of you who have suffered this pain. DO NOT LET CONDESCENDING WORDS FROM KNOW IT ALL'S WHO HAVE ONLY FANTISIZED ABOUT IT FOR TEN MINUTES MAKE YOU FEEL LESS WORTHY OF RESPECT. You deserve more respect than the ones giving lip service about something they have never done.<br>  <br>  And you have my respect. <br>  <br>  |`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	Yes. I think the only way I would be able to give my child up for adoption is if I knew the parents would let that baby know that he (lets say a he) was adopted and it was completely out of love. I would want to be able to see him grown and explain first hand why I chose to give him a better life without me. I would have so many questions for him, and would hope they would have many for me as well. |`|yDWcYXl5aa	My mother-in-law placed a child for adoption before she was married.  Her husband-to-be, then husband for over 40 years, knew of the adoption from day 1.   Her 3 children from the marriage knew nothing about the adoption until they were in their 40's.  <br>  <br>  The reunion didn't go bad, but there was a little struggle, I believe from the stress of not knowing the other, and the son wanting to know who his father was.  She loves him, was thrilled at the reunion.  He's turned out to be a fantastic man, but also loves her for what she did, that she gave him life, but in his own words, he didn't have the maternal feelings he originally thought he might have.  He calls her mother, and the woman who raised him is Mama to him, and he speaks very highly of her.  <br>  <br>  Now, my other half and his brother just met 2 weeks ago for the first time (oldest is 48, J is 44).  It was a great reunion in person, and they'd been talking on the phone since father's day.  It's weird how much alike their lives have been.  Both golf, both are just as comfortable talking to poor or rich people, both raised step-children and tried to adopt them as adults, but couldn't because of state laws.  Both would rather decorate the den in camo, go fishing, and golfing.  Both love to work on cars.  <br>  <br>  Their sister has met the brother given up for adoption, and the other brother refuses.<br>  <br>  Even if no reunion takes place, please offer as much medical information to him as possible, mainly age and reason of death of great-grandparents, grandparents, and any parent, brothers/sisters, etc.  Also, offer him the information of brothers and sisters to meet.  I know our family has been overjoyed with having another brother in it, although some families wouldn't.  Good luck!   Ironically, we had adopted a son, and through the questions/answers here, "J" decided to call his brother.  Now they're like 2 teenager on the phone.  It's more proof that genetics have a lot to do with personality and destinations in life.|`|UO1QE8phaa	I have not relinquished a child for adoption, but I am a woman who was adopted as an infant AND I have been reunited with my mother for 4+ years.<br>  <br>  So, from my side of this question, YES YES YES...she had been hoping and praying that I would find and contact her since the day I was born.<br>  <br>  She had kept all of her personal and contact information updated and supplied to all the outlets, search organizations and resources she could find and did so for my ENTIRE life.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, SHE found a search posting that I had made on a reunion website (www.the-seeker.com) and SHE contacted ME.  She had always wanted to reunite with me but felt it was not "her place" to look for me.  That is based on what she was TOLD by the agency workers when I was born and surrendered for adoption.  However, once she found my posting, she KNEW I was also looking for her and had just not found her yet...so, she wrote me an email.  Yay Mom!!!  She said she felt comfortable doing so because then she knew I WANTED to be found and I had stipulated in my posting "any and all forms of contact are welcome".<br>  <br>  So, from my own experience with my mother (and my father, too...he was also happy to hear from me) and from knowing and hearing from many, many other first/natural mothers and fathers...I would say YES, they do want to be found.  They do want to be contacted.  Not everyone wants to have an on-going relationship but, in my experience, MOST of them would rather know than not know.<br>  <br>  Take care!

iMULlxdgaa	yeah I know its every woman's worst nightmare!  Every parent's worst nightmare!  DOn't worry just make sure the mattress is free of blankets, pillows stuffed animales...they say turn on the ceiling fan to circulate the sir in the room (if you make it go reverse its actually good for the heat in the room to circulate as well and the baby won't get cold.  Just put the baby in one of those "baby bags"  with the zipper and everything else is covered but their face and head can't get covered.  You should be fine.  Its sooo crazy,  back in the day its seems like no one really lost sleep over these things. But they tell parents this for a reason and it is good that now we know more than before.  Put baby face up and you should eb fine,  babies that young can't roll over yet.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If its really effecting your life its possible you have post partum anxiety.      There aren't any unbiased studies that show mattress wrapping works, on the other hand it can't do any harm.  So if it would help you relax then go ahead and do it.    http://www.pregnancy-info.net/postpartum...  What is Postpartum Anxiety and Panic Disorder?  It is very normal for new mothers to worry about their baby and the responsibilities that accompany this little person. However, women affected by a postpartum anxiety and/or panic disorder experience excessive worries and fears regarding their child as well as their own actions. This postpartum mood disorder can cause women to suffer from debilitating panic attacks, experience overwhelming anxiety, and possibly even agoraphobia (an abnormal fear of open or public spaces).    What distinguishes this disorder from regular anxiety and panic disorders is the fact that it is triggered and occurs during the postpartum period. Experiencing a panic attack can be terrifying and can strike at any time and without warning. Many women feel especially nervous, agitated, apprehensive and tense because they fear another attack. However, it is important to note that having just one panic attack does not mean you suffer from postpartum anxiety and/or panic disorder.     [...]    Symptoms of Postpartum Anxiety and/or Panic Disorder  Onset of the disorder may occur within the first few days after birth or come on more gradually during the first year after birth. Women who suffer from this disorder tend to exhibit the following behavior:        * Trouble concentrating and remembering things      * Difficulties finishing everyday tasks      * Trouble making decisions      * Difficulty relaxing      * Insomnia      * Exhaustion      * Feelings of extreme uneasiness for prolonged periods of time      * Loss of appetite      * Possible suicidal thoughts      * Anxiety/panic attacks     Signs of a panic attack include:        * Shortness of breath      * Feeling of being choked or smothered      * Chest pain or discomfort      * Heart palpitations or increased heart rate      * Hot flashes or chills      * Sweating      * Trembling or shaking      * Tingling sensation      * Feeling faint, dizzy, lightheaded or unsteady      * Nausea or stomach upset      * Depersonalization (feeling removed or disoriented from the world)      * Fear of going crazy or doing something uncontrolled      * Sense of impending doom or death     At least four of these 14 symptoms will be present during a panic attack.|`|mrYCeWoMaa	I was so scared about it, that my daughter slept in a reclining baby seat-bassinet until she was 9 months old, then i finally moved her the her crib, and still sleep in her room half of the time even though she is 14 months old.

okh3hL8taa	What a baby sittercharges depends upon where they live.  There is no "average" hourly rate because babysitters are individuals.  If you are looking for information on how much to charge for babysitting check with other's who babysit.  If you are looking for how much it will cost, again check with babysitters in your area as to how much they charge.<br>  <br>  I have a niece in Northern California who gets $15-$20 an hour for babysitting depending upon how many kids and if she stays past midnight.|`|SMxoL9DAaa	I babysit two families regularly. One family pays me about 12  dollars and hour for their two kids Luke (6) and Mauve (4). They also have a third kid but he is only about 5 monthes so I do not watch him reguarly but i have some times. The  other family pays me at least 10 dollars and hour for their two boys Addision (7) and Ethen (5).|`|oFvz3Prnaa	Were I live most people pay 10 dollars an hour for one child. Then it just depends on the family for how much if there is more than one child.|`|YsLS4vOmaa	$15 4 a day is wat i charge 4, 2 kids|`|asMgblHjaa	I charge 20 for 2|`|2dya7YeKaa	When I babysat 10 years ago I charged $2.50 an hour.  This was in the Midwest.  So maybe $5.00?|`|WyRfOHz4aa	It depends on the family's condition of course.<br>  I get paid 5 bucks an hour for two kids under ten.
cLrQcCzhaa	If you are a devoted tracker of your period than you should know that your body can change without notice. Have you recently had unprotected sex? If so than I'd say go get a 99 cent test to be sure. The female body can be so complicated at times, you can consistently have the same period date for 4 months straight and then out of no where have it earlier, later or even two weeks after you just had it. Frustrating!!! Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!!!|`|5r21ddtVaa	You must keep track at least three months of your cycle and ovulating, so you can know your body. It does change. If you have not seen the stretchy egg whites discharge, then you probably haven't ovulated yet. You still get a discharge after you have ovulated. It becomes sticky.<br>  <br>  You could have alresdy ovulated, or maybe you haven't. 
xGFv6HvGaa	i LOVE the name Harley for a girl! i've liked it for a while but everyone's always like.. "do you really want a little girl named after a motorcycle?" and i'm like no but I LOVE THE NAME. it's adorable. and also Sapling is different, but i think it's cute. :)|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I like Jasmine. |`|CMuL7XpKaa	sorry i like Jasmina|`|GHnkKwl3aa	Sapling?

And by the way tink and da are not words.  I strongly suggest paying more attention in school or at least read the dictionary.|`|5jsqVwGlaa	I like Jazmynia And Genni.|`|sESYI8yKaa	yeah it LITERALLY does sound like a young tree...or a maple syrup brand.<br>  <br>  You must be out of your mind.|`|AA11352678	Why do people do that to their children?|`|li0IbOt1aa	DO YOU HATE YOUR FRIEND'S CHILD?  Think of how this baby is going to feel growing up if they have a name like harley?  That's a motorcycle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... 
qXq0nmBzaa	That's a real sign of maturity to reconsider the names.  That willingness to look at both sides of an issue will help make you a terrific mom.   Good luck to you.    Yes, your mom is right. These ARE just the kind of names that teenagers choose.   Favorite descriptions seem to be  "cute", "unique", "creative", and "kick-a$$"    Precious used to be one of those "cute" names. Today, Precious is trying to get a job and possibly losing out to Anne. Precious certainly is "cute" but could you really see her as a minister, judge, or bank executive?    You need to think 20 years ahead. Picture your daughter as a mature young woman going out in the world. The names you have chosen (especially Kaydee--sounds like Katie with a headcold) will, quite possibly, prove to be hurdles she has to get over instead of a name that helps achieve her goals.    Yes, I think the names reflect a certain level of immaturity but it's not fatal.   1) Start checking out the names of people you really admire in your life or in general.   2) Really listen to the sound of the names.   3) Are there cute nicknames to use for a young child?   4) Will the name look professional on a business card?  5) Run the names by a 12 yr old boy to check for nasty nicknames.  6) Find some really good baby-name sites but beware of the all-inclusive "unisex". They can be unfair to the child and the general public.  7) You don't have to settle for Mary Louise but don't get too weird.     You're doing well with names that flow nicely--your syllable count is very pleasant. With a little more effort, I believe you'll come up with names that will satisfy you and make the rest of the family proud.|`|e0xpYnv1aa	I don't think so. My daughter's name is Evelyn, which I think is a really classy name...and I'm not the least bit classy. Farthest from it.    I like the name Layla alot, just because I'm a big Eric Clapton fan haha I like Isabella too, but I'm starting to see that name a lot these days.|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Isabella Rose is cute. I'd name my kid that|`|xpUyH0psaa	isabella rose is not bad. how about layla rose?  i don't think the name of a child really reflect on the mother, except about her taste in names. it is all about the sounds the mother and father likes along with the meaning of the name.|`|wi4XXfCEaa	I definitely think the names Kaydee Rayne and Layla Hayden reflect an immature mom, but I think Isabella Rose is pretty and it sounds like a name a 'mature' mother would give her child!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	No, I don't think they reflect on an immature mom at all!   I love Isabella Rose. Kaydee Rayne is cute, but I would spell it Kady Rain. Layla Hayden is pretty, I love Layla, just not a fan of Hayden.     An immature mom would choose something like Destiny, Nevaeh, or Miley.     what names did THEY suggest?|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	No I don't think so.    What about the celebrity's who call their kids silly names? And they didn't have their kids when they were teenagers.    I like Isabella Rose, Its very cute!|`|S9F6RUncaa	I think you should choose Layla! Its so pretty. My sister is 17 and pregnant too!|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I don't like Kaydee Rayne or Hayden. Layla, Isabella and Rose are all pretty though!  I would go with something that people will know how to spell, nothing misspelled.    Isabella Rose is beautiful, and Layla Rose is also.|`|DP48dIxhaa	I don't think that if you name her one of those thennn people will thinkkkk you were a teenager when u had her. I think they're cute names....and even a 40 yr old could name their child that if theyyyyy like the names. U shouldn't re-consider...its ur babyy and you can name her whatever u want. My fav is Isabella Rose though...cause Isabella is now a popular name..so whennn shes older there will most likelyy be other girls her withhh her name. Its the least immature I guess.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I think they are quite daft then. What about Isabella Rose says "teenager" named me? By the way that is the only name of yours I like.|`|gxqawyxUaa	I do believe that names can reflect the parent(s). I don't think that you can tell when the child had a child by their name choice. However, Marquita La'Rae sounds immature.    Throw out some other names for us to give opinions :)|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Well i had my first Tiana when i was 17 and everyone sneered and said i should call her grace!!!!     8yrs on and now grace is a common name and getting over used and everyone says ohh i love that name meaning tiana's name so stick with what you love      anyway isabella rose is a timeless name|`|GMabcQXwaa	I really Kaydee Rayne.  And then second I like Isabella Rose, or maybe Isabella Rayne?  I think they only reflect on the mom, if like the mom was a bad partier and stuff and named her kid some really weird name, that wasn't spelt right, or after a drug or something. (yeah I know some ppl like that)  There is someone I know, who's mom made her daughters name with L(first letter)C(second, so one)D.|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	i don't think they show that you're immature. a lot of people are picking unique names like that now. isabella is i think the most popular girl name right now. i wouldnt pick it for that reason lol but it's your baby.  i really like layla. i think layla rose would a beautiful name. if you're mature enough to go through with the pregnancy and have this baby then you're definitely mature enough to name it whatever you want. kudos to you for being responsible in this situation.   good luck ;]|`|5dwKI4bVaa	she is your baby if you like those names why not i like those names they are unique and i like that . my favorite is layla hayden|`|hTieELhTaa	I like isabella rose and layla, but i think hayden seems a little immature like your trying to hard to be unique and kaydee also why not just go for clasic and spell it katie? kadie?|`|lnZjIhDCaa	I have to agree with your family on Kaydee Rayne and Layla Hayden. Isabella Rose is okay, a lot of people are naming their kids that name. But that's probably the reason why I don't like those names it because Kaydee Raye+Layla Hayden sound like a immature mom made them up. Then Isabella Rose is just way to common for my taste.  The funny thing is, I'm a 14 year old who loves baby names and yet I agree with your family.  suggestions:  Melanie, Annabelle, Kirsten, Delilah, Rosalie, Amber, Sierra, Sasha, Audrina, Lydia, Kiera, Natalie, Marissa, Emmeline, and Cara.|`|kO65JfS8aa	Isabella Rose is a beautiful, elagant name. It is much more delicate and femanine than the others as they sound a bit tomboyish, and anything with 'ee' or 'isha' on the end do tend to sound a bit more chavy. I would never imagine a 17 year old would pick isabelle.  A child's name is important. I'm a young mum with a mixed heritage baby, and people always look down on me. When I introduce my daughter with her beautiful Nigerian name, people suddenly change and start asking me about it and being nice, as they can see that I value the culture. Situation is a little different from yours, but just told you to show you that ppl can look at you in how you bring your child up etc.|`|0sqRwzcfaa	well i think La La or giner or cyestal or isabella or des,ree would be a good name but its up to you the name that you give your baby reflecs you cause lets say you name her grace it makes you look like youare gracefull and elegant|`|UX3xjsFlaa	First of all you can name your little girl whatever you want because you are her Mother and have that right! All the names are pretty, I like Isabella Rose and Layla Hayden the best. I named my daughter Ella Grace which was considered a little "Different" or "cutesy" but I dont care and a lot of people give me compliments on a beautiful name!!  Good luck!!|`|AA11955868	Er, maybe they're talking about that they're all pretty names, maybe a little 'fluffy'. By that I mean they sound a little more elegant than most baby names you hear, so maybe they think you're dolling the names up a little bit?    I think kaydee is a little silly, but other than that, I kind of disagree with them. I really really doubt that in 15 years anyone will look at Layla and say, oh...teenage pregnancy? Yeah, I see that in the name there.    I would absolutely be willing to listen to your families ideas, but ultimately, this is your baby, and while you probably won't regret it for the rest of your life if they pick a name you don't really care for (unless you really hate it) you shouldn't let them pressure you into picking a name that you don't like.     Tell them you're open for suggestions, maybe you'll get some good ideas? But definately keep on coming up with your own ideas, and don't scrap these names either, I think they're nice names.    17? Pfft, my grandma was 16. ; D|`|hypmxRlJaa	I actually think those names sound very mature for your age... most teenagers pick either super common, plain names or weird names with weird spellings. All of your names are unique, but not weird. I really love Layla Hayden. It's so cute. Isabella is very common and Kaydee is just not my favorite. Tell them that it's your baby. Good luck! You're very strong.
HN9twtQlaa	I clicked open your photographs before reading your entire question or your real name. My first impression after I had looked at all of your photographs (besides the fact that I now desperately want your haircut) was that the name Anneliese would suit you. After reading your entire question I remain convinced that it's the right name.<br>  <br>  Anneliese is a name used in German, English, Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish. It's one of those names that sounds beautiful in both English and German, and is easy enough for English speakers to pronounce. Most English speakers will say the name as ANH-na-lees, while others will pronounce it AHN-a-LEE-za. The name is incredibly rare, especially in comparison to Emily. While Emily has been ranked the #1 in popularity for girls in the US since 1996 (and is very popular in other English speaking countries - check out the links in the source section for more info), Anneliese has only been in the top 1000 names once: when it ranked at #917 in 2005. Moreover, the name Anneliese has a very pretty meaning: 'favoured grace'. <br>  <br>  Other names that I think would suit you are: Annika, Ilsa, Heidi, Lorelei, Emmeline, Astrid and Aurora. <br>  <br>  Here are some lists of German girls names.

It's close, but sounds more mature and sophisticated. Then everyone can still call you Emmie or Em (to avoid confusion for everyone else) informally, but you'll have a more grown-up name for formal things like job applications, etc. Or if you want something less common, how about Emmeline, Emmelina or Emogen/Emogene?|`|J2gr1ogHaa	Violet, or Katherine. You look like a Katy right now, and will grow into Katherine|`|m5dkjO6iaa	Isabel <br>  Ella<br>  Heidi<br>  Linda<br>  Lena<br>  Anya|`|27pLJUYqaa	You look like a <br>  scarlett jane <br>  =)|`|NXVgwPcZaa	If I were to meet you and you introduced yourself as Emily I would believe you.  It's not a bad name, you know.<br>  But if you ARE dead set on changing your name....<br>  If I just looked at you (not considering your cultural background - I'm German too)...<br>  <br>  I would guess that you look exactly like an Abigail or a Jordyn.<br>  If not those, I would think you look like a Megan, a Taylor, or a Becki.<br>  <br>  I'm not quite sure why you don't like your name, but it obviously has to be a good reason if you really want to change your name...<br>  <br>  You also kinda look like a Randy, Allie, and Kate.<br>  |`|R2yFAayPaa	Okay, so I tried to pick names that matched your look: cute, a little funky, smart and independent (and I'm probably old enough to be your mother so I don't mean the cute in a creepy way).<br>  <br>  Names with German origins and their meanings:<br>  <br>  Ada –means joyful<br>  Alisa, Allysa, Ally –means noble and truth<br>  Amara –means eternal<br>  Della –means noble protector<br>  Elsa –means god’s oath<br>  Isa –means strong willed<br>  Katrina –means pure<br>  Marlie – means child of light<br>  Nadja – means hope<br>  Romy – means dew of the sea<br>  Tilly – means battle maiden, strength<br>  Vala – means singled out<br>  Zelda – means famous warrier<br>  <br>  Names I personally think would suit you but aren't German (at least to my knowledge):<br>  <br>  Prue<br>  Willa<br>  Elliot (yes for a girl)<br>  Camden<br>  Emerson<br>  Piper<br>  Summer<br>  Spencer<br>  Teyla<br>  Cordelia (Cordy for short)<br>  <br>  Whatever you pick, if you love it - it will be right for you!

8qw0Cdqiaa	Hmm, might be implantation bleeding.  It does seem a little early though.  Most time imp. bleeding occurs between 8 - 10 dpo so this would rule it out for you since you saw blood only 4 dpo.  It is more likely that you are correct in that you ovulated 3 days earlier.  Timing would be closer and then you could explain the temp. dip.  Still, I am hesitant for other reasons.  Imp. bleeding is usually very light and pink while you reported dk brown suggesting old blood.  This sounds more like AF.  I can definitely understand why you're confused.  Your body is sending you mixed signals.  <br>  <br>  As for the job, take it if it's what you want regardless of being pregnant or not.  If not, it may be a missed opportunity that you'll regret.  <br>  <br>  The only thing I can suggest at this point is to watch those temps and see if they remain low or if they spike back up.  This is the only way to know what is happening for certain. If they remain low and AF arrives then you might want to have a chat with your doctor to rule out any problems with your luteal phase.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust. |`|wQHPel46aa	Do you have a chart you could post for us to see more clearly what your temps look like?<br>  <br>  I think its entirely possible for an implantation dip to happen after the implanation bleeding. You'll have to watch out and see if your temps go back up tomorrow. I know its hard not to obessess on a single day's temp! I do that all the time!!<br>  <br>  I'll be checkin' back on this q to see if you've uploaded a chart..
45xNJ7Ncaa	Implantation bleeding can only happen 5 days after ovulation but usually begins 8 days after ovulation.<br>  <br>  It could have been a faulty test or you could have had 2 surges.  Older women tend to have this happen.  It's caused by the ovaries not listening to the lh surge and releasing the egg the 1st time.  The brain continues to pick up the fsh levels so it sends out another lh surge.  Egg is usually fragmented if it does release.  It could also turn into a functional cyst.<br>  <br>  I would go ahead and have sex today and tomorrow just in case.  You never know when your lucky month will be.|`|H3I7kVwPaa	Try to use the ovulation calendar like<br>  <a href="http://www.softorbits.com/awc" rel="nofollow">http://www.softorbits.com/awc</a><br>  to trace your cycle and find the date of ovulation|`|Fdh7j4uraa	you do know that I faint line on an OPK is not a positive right?<br>  <br>  Unless the second line is the same color or darker than the control line than the test is negative. So both the test you took on cd11 and today are negative. 
olqHO0y9aa	Nope it definitely wouldn't have an effect on implantation. If it did we wouldn't be able to have sex and that's far more intense than riding a lawn mower!|`|c0cb979abb77dc7436cdcf4b66d1d6afaa	no noraml activities you do should not effect implantation |`|AA12352418	No, that's highly improbable. You'd have to sustain a direct hit - something like a car crash that would inevitably result in a miscarriage et cetera. <br>  <br>  Normal activity is not going to dislodge the egg. It's a different, fluid filled environment - imagine moving in space or water.  The "shock" isn't there - the shock waves and impact would be lessened.|`|9bUN1AHFaa	I doubt it.  I don't think things in your body respond to what you are doing on the outside. <br>  <br>  But it's not silly, I never thought of it that way.
74e498805852d014ca8d2e4a20ff32afaa	I was 11 days late...I took 4 home pregnancy tests all came back positive...i went to the doctor on the 12th day both tests came back negative...so i was still worried because i had took 6 tests all together and more than half were positive...i went back to the doctor 4 days later and one test came back negative and one came back positive..so they had me do an ultrasound turns out I was 9 weeks pregnant...so you cant always rely on any kind of test...because even my HCG levels were really really low...if you feel like you are pregnant...most likely you are.|`|hFkLAHDkaa	I would wait longer.  when I missed my first period all the tests said negative even after a couple weeks. I got frusterated and decided to wait until my next period. when i missed my second one then it finally said positive. It says no because your levels of hcg are too low. so you can either wait longer and try again or do the blood test which can detect smaller amounts. I hope you get the results you want! good luck!|`|r5kJq528aa	I would get a blood test. I am a week late and today just had my first positive test. I was feeling frustrated and antsy.

iyRWN59Xaa	I'm sure a little won't hurt, but usually it's not necessary to season baby food.  They have much more sensitive taste buds than we do.  But, if that's they way to get her to eat them, then go for it.  Have you tried some cheese on vegetables too?|`|8t8NjjnVaa	It's won't necessarily hurt her, but I would advise against it.  The same goes for salt and butter.  A little bit won't hurt them, but it makes them used to eating their veggies that way.  So they may never enjoy them without all the added stuff that isn't good for you anyway.<br>  <br>  I never added salt, sugar, or butter to my children's food.  Now, even at 5 and 8, they eat all their veggies plain because they didn't grow up with a taste for salt or butter or sugar on their vegetables.   They don't salt their food, they don't butter their bread.   <br>  <br>  Sugar, salt, and butter are okay in moderation, but they're going to get so much of it from other sources.  It's better to keep it out of their diet as much as possible, especially at home.  <br>  <br>  If you sugar her vegetables now, she will probably never like them any other way.  It's better to just leave them plain and just keep trying.  <br>  <br>  And if she doesn't like the sweet potatoes, that's fine.  She's not going to like everything you try to give her, so don't force it by trying to sweeten them up.<br>  <br>  Besides, she's 6 months old.  Solids at this point are all about trying new tastes and textures, not really about calories or nutrition at this point.  So it's absolutely fine if she doesn't eat any of it.|`|RtXaEarFaa	I wouldn't add sugar.  I have a 5 month old who is just starting to eat solids.  I make my own baby food too.  I feed my daughter a little bit of fruit with her veggies.  I gradually decrease the amount of fruit I put on the spoon with her veggies until she is eating just the vegetables.  Then I give her the rest of the fruit at the end.|`|jFrzBCeuaa	I was told to use brown sugar in my daughters bottle when she was constipated. I don't think it is harmful to your baby but I don't think that you really need to. You are developing your babies food pallet... do you want to give them sugar that young? They love the new tastes without adding sugar. |`|nuqehfHCaa	Don't do it. Let your child get use to the natural flavors of food. I breastfed four children and don't let them near sugar. I don't add it to anything because they have to get use to the flavors and textures. They eat their vegetables. I think it takes like nine times for them to get use to the taste.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Sugar isn't actively harmful (as you note, breastmilk contains a ton of sugar), but neither is it really a good idea.  You want your baby to get used to all different sorts of flavors; sweet, tart, bland and bitter. If she doesn't like a particular food unsweetened, try a different food.  There are so many options that she doens't have to like every food.<br>  <br>  (FWIW, my daughter hated the yellow/orange veggies as a baby,but loved the green ones.  She's now a teenager ... and still hates carrots and sweet potatoes, and loves brocolli and green beans.)|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	First of all, babies do not have a preference when they start food.  It takes 15 to 21 tastes for them to develop a like or dislike for a particular flavor.  Adding brown sugar may not outright harm her but it's definitely not good for her.  There is no reason to add sugar.  Would you ive your baby a soda?  No, because it's loaded with sugar right?  |`|ly59dQ3gaa	I wouldn't.  It's completely unnecessary and will just condition her for sweets.  Most babies don't like veggies right off the bat.  It's totally normal.  She'll eventually start liking it better, just keep offering it to her.<br>  <br>  This doesn't count as a veggie, but one thing my daughter LOVED was banana mixed w/ avocado.  she HATED avocado by itself, so I just mixed the two.  Avocado is one of the best 'first foods' you can give your baby.  Try it!|`|5f37c1ca843baed941347175d05ad20eaa	I don't think it would be harmful for your baby, but it's not really a good idea.  You'll be training her palate to prefer sweet things, and that's going to create so many problems in the future.  She'll prefer cookies to veggies, and soda to water or milk.  |`|iQjS2lJ4aa	she will never like veggies as they are if you put sugar in!<br>  <br>  Babies don't have developed taste buds like we do , so no, Id say its unnecessary. Squash and sweet potato are sweet anyway.|`|kQEnJpOvaa	I think that her stools will be VERY loose if you try that. I would just make them regular. If you want to sweeten them up add some sweet potatoes or Peas, they are naturally sweet. 
fzznNwOmaa	Breastmilk and formula have the highest concentration of calories...so they'll gain more weight on just formula or breastmilk.<br>  <br>  Around the age when babies are introduced to solids (6 months), their weight gain starts to slow.  It's not because of the solids, it's just their growth pattern.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway- don't worry about your daughter's weight and what your MIL thinks of it.  Giving her cereal won't make her gain more weight anyway.|`|u1rMENJKaa	yes tryin new foods will slow theyr weight gain down|`|1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	This is very interesting. I was also told weight gain slows down. My girlfriend said solids digests faster- I thought that was odd but maybe true|`|gqWyki24aa	the babies get more mobile which in a sense burns more calories quicker so even if they eat solids that dosnt mean they will gain weight quicker.  mine gained more while she was on just breastmilk and sitting like a blob before she could get around.
3AsqotQYaa	Yes, I like that name.|`|zyTvtgS2aa	yes its pretty|`|4OUszQ6zaa	Yes it's nice and cute. There's many different spellings to it too. I prefer it spelled Haylee. But yes if is a good, solid name. I love Haylee Marie.|`|fIYq1U7Qaa	of corse!!! my friend's name is that!!!<br>  but i like kailey better it has more spice|`|ae0159e59b3fbc2e0f51b0cc12e751e9aa	Yes! I love the name spelled like Hayley!<br>  <br>  Hayley Marie and Hayley Alexis are so cute!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|G6p7QSedaa	yes its very cute|`|d1ze4HWpaa	not much. it's very vanilla. but if you like it, that's all that really matters.|`|ClOdviETaa	I don't like it because i think it doesn't really have any zest or unique flavor to the name. There's so many other names out there that are graceful or pretty and I just don't see that with Hailey.|`|Dr0Sf12Oaa	It SOUNDS nice, but what does the name MEAN?<br>  That is one of my friends' little brother's name.|`|Qv5iA3Wxaa	i dont like it very much. but i like kailey|`|v2OJ5GYjaa	its so common but its a pretty name.
VdI879HUaa	Your body is just getting back into normal rhythm I know it must be frustrating.    You need to ovulate before there is a chance to conceive. Since you have gotten your period that's a great sign. 14 days from the day you ger your period is approx when you ovulate.    There is a great website you can try to work it out http://www.babycentre.co.uk/tools/ovu/ work out the dates as an indicator. Remember have sex everyday right up and after your fertile time as sperm can live inside your cervix for 5 days.    Hope this helps :-)    Good luck :-)|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	These are all ?? you should be asking your Doc
AA11854502	my first was at 12 weeks n my 2nd at 21 weeks. u will no wen u feel it!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	about 2 weeks ago,16 w it felt like bubbles at first. just all going from ur belly upwards, tickeled,<br>  <br>  and now i can feel it moving around, nearly 19w<br>  cant tell if hand or feet but i get stronger movements and less stronger movements , like a pushing towards the front of my belly<br>  <br>  cute..<br>   best wishes. ull feel when u least expect it.|`|3fk6bTMxaa	Usually around 20 weeks. I am glad you are doing your research. Congrats and best wishes, G|`|v87rsm8Eaa	With my first, I first felt him in the week before my morphology ultrasound (17 weeks), and with my second (I'm assuming because I sort of knew what it felt like already) I could feel little bubbly tickles from around 12 weeks, then larger movements around 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  The earliest movements feel (to me!) kind of like when your tummy rumbles, but lower down, and without the growly noise, and later on they become quite definite thumps and bumps that you just KNOW is not you. Now I'm at 24+ weeks, I'm starting to see my belly move when there are particularly vigourous jabs, and it often feels like an octopus in there - I swear there are pokes in more places than limbs can account for!|`|TnCcOaFQaa	I felt mine around 20 weeks.  It didn't feel like a "gas bubble" or flutter.  I knew it was definitely my baby.  All pregnancies are different though.  Just be patient.  When you feel it, it is amazing!  Good luck to you.|`|EpfVsCa2aa	around 20-21 weeks along is when u will feel the baby move |`|xqfZm7djaa	With my first child, it was closer to 20 weeks from lmp before I felt movement; it was kind of like butterflies in my stomach.  With this pregnancy, I felt movement at 16 weeks from lmp.  this time, it feels less fluttery and more like stronger poking and wiggling.<br>  <br>  Enjoy this time in pregnancy, and those first movements will come!  Best wishes for a healthy pregnancy and baby!<br>   |`|4hKhqlnIaa	I was 16 weeks the first time I felt her move...then it stopped then started again when I was 20 weeks...It feels like light tapping or imagine a butterfly fluttering its wings...or like gas bubbles...pretty cool..that's probably the only thing I liked about pregnancy was feeling my baby move...good luck!!
KmC0K59taa	I personally would not take any meds while pregnant.  I think a lot of what you are feeling is from hormones.  Then again, if you just left your husband and are facing single motherhood you have a lot on your plate.<br>  <br>  A doctor once told me that I could continue taking my Zoloft until my 3rd trimester, but I didn't want the chemicals in my baby's body.  They say it is safe, but how many tests and studies have really been done?<br>  To me it wouldn't be worth it to have a baby with birth defects, etc.<br>  <br>  I think you should see a therapist ASAP.  You need someone to help you through this difficult time.  You need to be there 100% when that baby comes.|`|CJqK40uFaa	oh my goodness. we are in the same boat. my childs father left me too, i was doing really good, i got off my meds (zoloft) when i found out i was pregnant, but i can feel my depression coming back too. i heard that wellbutrin is safest for pregnant women but it doesnt really help me much. i think you should call your doctor and talk to them, get an appointment with a psychiatrist and see what they say. seriously. its bad for the baby to feel all that stress. trust me i know. i have been crying on and off the last week or so. just call the doc and ask your nurse what they think you should do. i just called mine and im waiting for my return phone call. good luck

It sounds made up, and a strange spelling. Grace is pretty if it's a name with special meaning    Kamryn Lynn Elizabeth - It's a bit of a tongue twister, but I like Kamryn Lynn OR Kamryn Elizabeth. I prefer the latter.    Emily Carrin - I really like this one! I love Emily, no matter how popular it is. And Carrin gives it a unique twist. Very cute!

NqQyFElCaa	I've heard/read that no more than about 25 or 30 pounds is okay... but I've seen pregnant women carrying a lot more than that (usually toddlers). It depends what you're used to - if you pick her up all the time, it's not likely to hurt you as long as you lift properly. One woman I work with claims she  moved a couple of days before she was due - and she was lifting and carrying tons of stuff. I wouldn't recommend that, but you'll probably find it hard not to carry your daughter if you and she are used to it!|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	oh... geesh. Women in third world countries strap their 3 year olds to their backs, and carry heavy pots full of water on their heads and haul it 5 miles down the road while being 8 months pregnant, you'll be fine just dont over exert yourself.|`|7edddef837f9013ff2f1f46a6893dcb7aa	It really depends on how much you were comfortable lifting before pregnancy. The risk of heavy lifting during pregnancy is that you'll pull an abdominal or back muscle - you are not going to hurt the baby (unless you have a problem with the placenta or other complications).<br>  <br>  I was able to comfortably lift my own body weight before pregnancy (about 120 pounds), so even at almost 7 months, I can easily lift about 60 -70 pounds with no problem.  I don't try more than that because my balance is a little off, but I still work out with light/medium weights, do yoga, swim, and hike. My doctor says that because my body was accustomed to doing all that before pregnancy it's fine now.|`|H94IODgbaa	This is really a question for you Dr. I'm 19 weeks and still lift my 40 lbs son. My Dr is ok with it. Some site say stop lifting after a time line and others say go for it. <br>  <br>  Congrats!|`|29ZL58Xjaa	This you should ask your doctor about. They will be able to tell you the exact weight that you're able to carry in your case.|`|Kv9RSyPcaa	My doctor said not to lift anything heavier than my purse. I was bleeding for the first two months though. I have heard from others that 20 lbs is fine. |`|Kp341OYlaa	up in till the 5th month i did then i made my husband|`|odVTZbj4aa	none it is bad to work out when you are pregnant<br>  
M2JY8GRhaa	Yes! I was in the EXACT situation you are in! I asked the doctor and she said my baby will be fine!
IYwmDe7jaa	I am having problems with my 4 month old, no one can hold her, but me. I also went through it with my son just not as young as her.The only thing you can do is to keep doing what you are doing leaving him with people so he can get use to it<br>  Try leaving him with some one everyday start off With 1/2 hour to a hour long and come and get him, do that for a few days then in cress the time a little then stay at that time and in cress it again, the reason why I say everyday or at least a few times per week is because it does need to be consistent, soon he will get use to it and realize you will come back for him, if at all possible I would also leave him with 2 people for example if you go out 4x a week 2 of those days leave with his dad, and the other 2 leave with grandma, once he gets ok with you leaving him then get someone new, the more things become familiar and constant for him the better it will be for him like same time of day same person and place ect routine worked great for my son, hard to do with my daughter because I am still breastfeeding her and she does not like a bottle, but I will do the same for her as well. good luck hope this helps
apUkTo3maa	DONT STRESS DONT THINK ABOUT IT..... DONT WORRY IN A WEEK TAKE A TEST....|`|eRlNQxbNaa	Take another test in a few days.  Early detection tests might be able to give you a result  this soon.  If you feel movement it is most likely gas since you really wouldn't be able to detect fetal movement until about 17 weeks or so.    When I first thought I might be pregnant I had very sore boobs.  Other than that I really thought my period was coming-I had cramps and huge chocolate cravings.|`|jNgh3e3Faa	You do not feel the baby.  You are not even late yet. The day is not over.  Give it a while or if you want to know so bad, take a test now and see. At your doctor's.|`|x7JBccGzaa	i think you are.|`|nUu7tUiqaa	The only way to be sure is to go to your doctor and get a test done. A sharp pain does not indicate pregnancy. I doubt that you are, since you tested negative, however to be sure, you need to go and get a test from your doctor. It doesn't take long at all.|`|2xPWnuhVaa	Take another test, your prego.|`|2oAeOFXcaa	it ight just be once in you're life you're period is late it happned to me take about three pregnecy tests then you will know for sure   xx|`|VWcqTzYHaa	see a doctor or go to a clinic. it may be something else|`|70kh6VSoaa	theres not way your feel the baby move yet thats not possible but wait a few days and take a test you have to really miss you . before its accurate|`|tv0wEcDWaa	Go see a doctor.|`|fLolZCXJaa	its possible to be pregnant but dont get your hopes up. your period might come l8r today or tomorrow. you wont feel any symptoms at all right now its WAY too early. it takes a month to feel it. so if you are your not gonna know yet and you'll have to take another test in a few weeks
wnOy12Tzaa	Everyone responds to birth control differently. Depo I don't advise as many women develop Osteoporosis within a few years. The patch is a little scary to me, it almost killed my friends colon and she was in the hospital for months plus I have heard doctors say they won't prescribe it. i would try a low dose pill, but beware if you smoke, have migraines, or stroke in the family/ clotting issues. Good luck with your choice, but please do your research! Drugs.com is good to reasearch once you have been given something. =)|`|a110d17d2efa9551adeba5b30532c00eaa	I think the very best birth control is the depo shot.<br>  I was on the shot for nearly 4 years...I loved it because it stopped my periods completely. Once i stopped using it i became pregnant 11 months later.<br>  <br>  I would take the pill before i would the patch because their is a lawsuit out right now against the patch because alot of women have died from it.|`|AIwDdAKcaa	They are both about the same regarding effectiveness when used perfectly, however, its harder to use the pill perfectly since the "perfect" usage implies taking it at the exact same time every day.  Since the patch is a bit easier to use perfectly, it might be slightly more effective, as its harder to mess up.|`|DonP74RZaa	hello,<br>  if you want read something about pregnancy <br>  i just come accross this blog which may help you :-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pregnancy-questions.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://pregnancy-questions.blogspot.com</a><br>  <a href="http://questions-about-pregnancy.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://questions-about-pregnancy.blogspo...</a>

Do you have a feeling he will come early?  I kind of have a feeling mine will.|`|gHRbi3c5aa	babies are a bit like the train service. You have a timetable. Everybody plans everything based on that timetable and then baby - -  like the train, - - - - comes when it comes!    have fun!|`|HQKuzxulaa	It usually takes 9 months, give or take the odd day.|`|78FXygtoaa	nipple stimulation and orgasms are supposed 2 help induce labor. try that.   good luck =]|`|GNgp759Yaa	im 38 weeks and due feb 15th ive had the same problems as you except i have started "drop" im 2/5 now and 2day i just lost my mucus plug. ive had all the loose stools and terrible diarrhoea and cramps but now they seem to of all stopped. the loose stools is just your body clearing itself out for the birth. when your mucus plug falls out i would say you have days, weeks until you go into labour.     however ive heard that all these symptoms we both seem to be experiencing is slow labour, you just need to sit tight and wait, if you go over they will induce you.     sex is a good way to get things going. i had sex last night and the night before and 2day my plug fell out :D   good luck

I don't think there are any other ways to spell it.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	Spell it Joseph because the name is Joseph and it should stay Joseph.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Names always start  with a "capitol" letter. I've seen Joseph spelled "Josef" & that's the only way I've seen it spelled.
1UpR1vSCaa	Triple C is a slang term for the over-the-counter medication Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold, which contains dextromethorphan, or DXM. The medication is abused because it contains dextromethorphan which, when taken in doses that dramatically exceed those recommended by physicians and pharmacists, produces hallucinations and a sense of dissociation. The medication is used legitimately to treat the symptoms that typically result from colds or upper respiratory allergies.|`|X6as2nOAaa	call the doc and ask them so they can check the baby|`|IlSALGKMaa	People who take triple c's are so retarded.|`|zF4acGKPaa	she took 24 triple c's!!! wow! well the doctors will probably look for any birth defects around 20 weeks.|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	What are triple c's? Is it like ecstasy?     If its a drug, yes it could harm the baby really badly. A girl I knew went on a pill spree, found out she was pregnant. She had damaged the baby so badly, the pregnancy had to be terminated. At 8 weeks.
h85kkDsbaa	Her cold could be from the teething, you will no if she is sick because she will get a temperature and will go off her feed. Try some calpol at night to help with the teething pain. If the pain has suddenly got worse you may notice a tooth appear in the next few days.
HPRlEWu1aa	yea not having sickness is totally fine .. it may come later, or u might be lucky n not get it at all :O)  with the cramps, its ur uterus stretching and growing. as long as u have no bleeding and blood spotting and ur cramps arent constant ure fine ... i get mine sometimes once a day other times 5x a day ... im 10 weeks pregnant. they were more often in early pregnancy tho. just take a look at the tissue after u pee and watch for blood    oh and CONGRATS MOMMY TO BE!|`|giRRCXU4aa	Cramping is normal in early pregnancy and sometimes throughout the whole thing. Bleeding in pregnancy can be bad. Though, you should always call your doctor before asking anyone here. Every pregnancy is different. Only you doctor can tell you everything is okay.|`|D35SFHbTaa	I had cramps for the first few weeks of my pregnancy too and my doc told me that as long as there was no bleeding, everything was probably ok. Everyone is different, so you may not feel morning sickness at all if you're lucky...but chances are it just hasn't caught up with you yet. I think I was 8 or 9 weeks before I started getting my "morning" sickness.    If you're concerned about any of it, though...ask your doctor!|`|3Oiwh3Ivaa	I'm 7 weeks and today was my first time actually vomiting. I have been nauseous the past few days and finally today it kicked into full gear. I kept on saying I wish I would get sick because I didn't feel pregnant either. As far as the cramps go that's normal! As long as your not bleeding your good! Good luck and God Bless Hun!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	Yes ma'am it is.  The cramps you're having is your uterus stretching and can be expected to last until you're 18 weeks.  The morning sickness is not a must in pregnancy...count your blessings you're one of the lucky ones!
hgPmwYAfaa	At about a year old...it's fun and wonderful as a parent..to watch all the growing changes your child takes as they become mobil and independent...we want to encourage them to explore and to continuously grow and learn....as toddlers approach 2 and sometimes long before that they need rules and boundaries and they need FIRM NOs to keep them safe...like holding an adult hand if you're close to a road...the rules are consistent with a lot of adult action...and not a lot of verbage...except what is necessary..."NO!..hold my hand" maybe point out fast cars and show him...it's a process...and it's consistency...and as a parent you have have to pick your battles but set the stage for future development...you have  to decide what you will allow and what is safe...for example in my house it was never ok to stand on the couch...I never did it so my kids can't...they started testing limits at about...one year on this one...and i would say..."Sit down"...and move them to sitting down...i would model sitting down and make them sit their with me...if they continued to stand...then they were taken off the couch....the message was the couch was for sitting and that's all that was said and shown...and we moved away from the area...if the situation continued...but at this age and stage he is testing limits and i would develop a tight schedule and get him out to run and play....a ball in the park is a good thing...run him...take him to story time at the library....he needs to be busy to be out of trouble...ok good luck and if you have other questions please email me.|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	this is pretty normal terrible twos with little boys it usually lasts a little longer but tye having some consequences for certain actions when he does not listen try maybe time out no snack or something like that but if you dont start doing something this will last alot longer than it has to my friends son was like that a two now he's three and it's worst he's cursing fighting spitting hitting you name it he does not listen at all|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Good luck terrible two's LOL|`|HXPxKEDQaa	terrible twoss... hope its a faze but sometimes its just there personality or even how they were raised or living environment.|`|INmPiwnMaa	Yup he is 2. I would tell my ladies I DONT want you to do .... what ever I realy wanted them to do and they would do it. They are learning they can do for them selvs and they want to start making desisions as well.|`|N5Iyltigaa	you need to give him consequences when he doesn't listen. You probably don't now, so he knows he can get away with whatever he was.|`|ZDMjuf4Taa	its so easy to see things more clearly when you are older and can look back on your own experiences i do remember when my two children were that age i made so many mistakes with them, they are now grown up and when i see and here parents trying to discipline their children i sometimes cringe, i had difficulty with my own grandaughter which was even harder because she had different rules in her house to which i had in mine so she must have been totally confused, your son has already learnt what to do by watching and listening to you, he knows and feels your body language and copies it, be consistent with him, say what you mean and act on it otherwise he will know that you will go back on your word, do not fall into the trap of saying to him i am warning you and then go back on your word if you tell him he has to go to bed at whatever time make sure you stick to it, but do not forget to praise him for good things and have some fun you only get the one chance god luck
zi9knUCGaa	The principal will have to talk to the other kid. That is protocol. I would follow up with the principal as to what was determined and what the course of action was. I'm sure the other kid will deny it. I would want to know if other students sitting on the bus witnessed any of it. Depending on the follow up actions by the principal would determine my next step. If the principal does nothing, then I would immediately go to the school board and the bus company. I would suggest assigned seating so that the preschool age students sit at the front of the bus. I would want to know if there is a bus safety monitor that rides with the students and if there was video camera detail.   You should probably call your local police department and explain the details and ask that a report be filed and include the pictures.   The school is responsible for your brother's safety. If all else fails, contact your local news station "problem-solvers" department. Once this is broadcasted, the school will jump through hoops to get the problem fixed!|`|fgGXzs4vaa	First off, unless you've viewed the videotape pulled from the bus, you *are* having to determine it based on one child's word vs. the other.    Most school buses these days have videotape running. Bypass the principal, and contact the school's transportation department. If this is not a school's bus, but instead a bus leased by the school, contact the owner of the private bus company and have the tape pulled.    If you're told there's no tape, ask what year the bus was manufactured. If it's a flat-front (like a transit bus), it's allowed to be on the road for 15 years. If it's the classic "Fisher-Price"-style bus with the engine block in front, it can remain in service for 12 years.    However, even if the bus is, say, 10 years old, and has 2 years of road life left, it *can* be retrofitted with a camera.     You will then ask to see the Seating Chart..these are required not only by Fire Code but by State Law. See if the third grader had any business whatsoever near the preschooler. If they're not seated together, then you can find out why, by having the driver brought in for a meeting between the child, parent, and principal.    And there are going to be difficulties on school buses, no matter what. The alternative is to drive the child. There have always been problems on school buses, and that's not likely to change...also, would you prefer the bus driver to be looking in the mirror and scolding children, or focusing on the road?    I know I wouldn't want to be responsible for a 52-passenger vehicle, especially with people's children on board. No thanks.    Edit: For the people clamoring for a lawyer to be contacted...try suing a public entity, if you're going after the school. It's not as easy as you think. There are WAY too many loopholes in the law for them to slip through. Want to go for a free consultation? Sure! But as long as you know that you'll probably lose, have at it.|`|fJXp9Kjxaa	this happened to me when i was younger (i was in 4th grade   the kid was in 8th and about 6'2)  i kicked him in the face because i was ready for it, he went back and never touched me again|`|wENdWT5kaa	Go over the principals head and straight to his boss, the school board.     If they don't do anything, then i personally would see a lawyer|`|oO4TUkVkaa	Threaten to go to the local news with the story, the pricipals tune will change very quickly.  The kids at the school my daughter attends were having to sit on the bus for half an hour in front of the school every morning till the teachers were "ready" for the kids".  I went to the principal and told her that that was dangerous because it was below zero and the fumes from the other buses could make the kids sick.  She said that was the way it was and they would not change it for one "rich ***** with nothing better to do than complain".  I went straight to the local news and the story hit that night.  The next day the kids were no longer sitting on buses in the morning they were allowed to go to their warm classes and the teachers were made to actually do their jobs.|`|koQ8H19Zaa	Lawyer no doubt, mob if nessecerry because bullying haunts you and hurts.|`|547Ln6rNaa	My child was assaulted at school and we were very concerned, we took pictures and called the police, but we were told that the child that hurt him wasn't old enough to be responsible for his actions, he must be 10 years old.    They did not offer to go and talk to the other child's parents.     I wish I could just say punch him back, but I don't want my child being the kind that hits other kids, but I so want to say it...you know?    The school probably can't be held liable, this was a persons actions, not their negligence. I'd make sure your brother sits up near the driver so nothing else can go on on the bus. I hope it works out ok for you all.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	You can report this to the police and the police will start a "jacket" of the incidents.  If this happens, again the other child can be taken into juvenile court.  I found that schools are pretty much useless in taking action unless you go to the school board to school superintendent.
LABC73E7aa	mamma mio tummy butter|`|OSAaln2Laa	Body Butter works best because it keeps your skin extra hydrated. Try some from The Body Shop or Fruits and Passion. Or if you don't have those stores in your area you can always opt for Palmer's stretch mark cream. The important thing is to not let your skin get dry at all. Good luck!|`|PAdif484aa	Palmer's lotion worked really well for me. You can buy it at Walmart.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	ive used bio-oil...i already had stretch marks from my last ..that i had almost unnoticable...so i was trying to prevent more.....the bio-oil has helped the old ones ALOT  and i havent gotten any new ones....its a little bottle of oil but its worth it...i used about 11/2 bottles a month at @ 11$ a bottle..u can get it at target..walgreens..or go to bio-oil.com|`|0kuNJQpwaa	Hi,    Here is a homemade remedy for stretch marks that I came across in a book. I think it's a matter of looking at a few things to find what suits you.    Mixture of 1/2 virgin olive oil, 1/4 cup aloe vera gel, and liquid from 6 capsules of vitamin E,  and liquid from 4 capsules of vitamin A. Put them in a blender and store this mixture in the  refrigerator. Use daily.|`|uunQVSGFaa	Im not to sure about if this is the best but bio oil or olive oil.  Also, eating more fish can increase the elasticity of your skin, but seafood isn't really safe during pregnancy so go to the chemist and get some fish oil tablets, they taste yuck but they may help if you start taking them early on in your pregnancy     oh and congratulations how far along are you?    ADDITION    these are some things to inrease skin elasticity    -Vitamin E   -Aloe Vera  -Your skin is 70% water, so eat enough protein and keep hydrated..  -Collagen-Elastin supplements  -Omega 3 Fatty Acids.  -POTASSIUM .  -Also, it helps to cut down the sweets.
ykP7I3caaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with that. I used to go get in bed with my dad in the morning or go sleep in his bed when I was at his house. He never molested me. I think with all the sick things that are happening nowadays people can think for the worst, but men are parents just like you are and MOST would never wish any harm on their children.    EDIT - I wouldn't reproduce with someone I had second thoughts about in that way.|`|aCUHzMrmaa	Co-sleeping period is stupid and bad for the kid.|`|pJ7icz0taa	NO..Are you sick????|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Yes I would, nothing wrong with that if it's just an occasional thing for practical reasons but kids need their own space as do parents, some boundaries should be set.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	On occasion there is no problem.  Our daughter would often get in bed with us during rough weather, or if she got scared.  She'd wriggle between her father and myself and he'd sleep with his arm tossed over both of us.    If it's all the time then I'd say no.  Not because she's sleeping in a bed with her father but because at that age they should be in their bed.  Some instances wouldn't be too bad, like being scared, but she should really be in her bed.|`|FSQXh9e6aa	ya why not.|`|FHxZx4Thaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with it, just like I don't think there's anything wrong with my son sleeping with me. I'd be pissed if someone insinuated I'd do anything to hurt him.|`|qcLP5j8zaa	Generally it's a good practice to teach children to sleep in their own bed.  No I do not agree with your question.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	My daughter still sleeps in the same bed as her step father, she is 9.  She doesn't do it often, she only does it during storms or after a bad dream.  Why?|`|XULTEnl3aa	I slept in bed with my parents untill I was in 3rd grade and no i was never molested lol. as long as daddy's being good it's fine :)|`|2pypL9KRaa	absolutely.  I think if you can't trust your daughter with her father (husband or not), than she shouldn't see him at all.|`|8b9e5894f70e3364d0f2490295d49b82aa	I would not be uncomfortable with my daughter sleeping the same bed as her Daddy if she was six.  Not as a regular thing, but when she was scared of a storm or when she had a bad dream.  I don't see anything wrong with it if he is a good Daddy.|`|QNUo59dUaa	Absolutely; if you can't trust him with your daughter you need to drop him.  A child sleeping with either parent after a bad dream or whatever reason is all a part of parenting.  If you have doubts don't second guess yourself.  Best of luck for all three of you :)|`|kaqPSgTVaa	? What are you implying ?

HZbSbZIraa	I am 12 weeks pregnant and I had very similar sypmtoms in the beginging I thought for sure I was going to start my period ANY day I am very regular start on the 28th day but never started. You can have very simialr pains as your period in your first weeks of pregnancy. I only waited four days after my missed period and two home pregnancy tests later I knew i was pregnant. I think if you wait another day take another at home test get a clear blue digitial one it is like 10 bucks at walmart you get two tests and they are super accurate there is not line it just straight up says pregnant or not pregnant and they work very well. If you are pregnant by now it will for sure show up on a HPT !!!!! Good luck :)
JDKYKoDTaa	Anytime you have sex you run the risk of getting pregnant. Whether it's 2 seconds for 20 minutes. Wait before you start worrying. If you don't you're going to think every little thing is a sign of being pregnant. If you're late on your period take a pregnancy test and then go from there.|`|yiq9B0i8aa	Yes it is possible to get pregnant even if your partner pulls out.  If semen even gets too close to the vaginal opening, it is possible for a girl to get pregnant.  The odds may not be as great, but it is still possible.  Also there is sperm in the pre-ejaculate fluid, which is why the withdrawal method is not a reliable form of birth control either.  If you are going to have sex and want to reduce the risk of pregnancy, always use a condom and another form of birth control as back-up.|`|a94851c62a864ef40a8deea0791ce33daa	You can be pregnant as easily as that.  I suggest taking a pregnancy test to find out.  That way you can ease your worries quickly.  In the future, consider this a lesson learned.  No penetration without a condom, period.|`|jYOBoEwAaa	don't jump to conclusions. yes there is a possibility that you are. But I would wait until you miss your period, morning sickness, soreness of breasts or any other symptom like that before you think you are pregnant|`|FXPTeTcPaa	Sure can. :)<br>  <br>  Unprotected sex can equal pregnancy whether it's 3 seconds, 30 seconds, or 30 mins.

FYiKgeN8aa	You could try offering the breast more often.  Also suppliments like fenugreek help increase milk supply.  I wouldn't start solids yet.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Review through this website...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/index....</a><br>  <br>  The rule of breastfeeding is the more the baby is at breast the more your supply will be, therefore eliminating any need to supplement. Try to wean baby off the formula and keep baby at breast. Allow them to stop the feeding. Let baby "comfort suck" the breast rather than a pacifier to stimulate production. The above link has a plethora of information that will really encourage and help you!!|`|avx7bLnKaa	well because you are supplementing with formula of course your body isn't making enough breastmilk to fill his needs... unless of course physically you were unable to produce enough milk... .then thats not your fault...<br>  <br>  nurse him more or give him more formula... it is recommended not to give solids until at least 6 months... and solids at this age are not for nutritional needs but just to get the baby used to spoons, textures and tastes... only as a supplement not as a replacement of formula or breast milk<br>  <br>  formula or breast milk should be the main source of nutrtion for the 1st 12 months with solids supplementing the formula or breast milk|`|IYwmDe7jaa	My daughter is also 4 months old and breastfeed, she too was seeming to wait more, so when I was at my doctors for her 4 month check up my doctor Said I could start her on infant cereal 1tbsp a day 1/2 in morning and 1/2 at night and it has made a big difference she is happy, and I am happy, no more fussing on and off during the day, and she is back to sleeping through the night again, so I say start him on a rice infant cereal if he is at a good weight, but if you don't feel comfortable talk to your doctor about it first.

After the green vegetables comes the yellow and orange ones. Squash, sweet potatoes, corn, etc. Then move onto fruits again introduce on food at a time. Good luck!|`|dFo0k3zDaa	you can start foods as early as 4-6 months. be careful though... I started my son at 4 months and it was really hard on his tummy, it caused lots of constipation. start with stuff that is pretty easy, cereals and light fruit, like pears.

lkHA65LMaa	Have you thought about adoption? It's not easy, but there are many loving couples who can't have children. With an open adoption you get to interview the families and select the one that most shares your values and dreams for your child.<br>  <br>  The younger you are the harder it is to raise a child. Your lack of education and work experience limits your income and the opportunities you can offer your child. Your age and experience makes stressful situations more overwhelming.<br>  <br>  You can stay in school. But imagine studying for finals or SATs while caring for a child with the flu or up all night cutting their molars. Will you be able to find stable child care so you can attend school? Who will care for the child when they're sick? If they're in childcare they will be sick often, they will also catch head lice, have weird rashes, and be exposed to any number of viruses. All of which they share with you.  It is tough to care for a child with the flu when you are busy throwing up.<br>  <br>  A mature two parent family offers a child more opportunities. You can chose a family with a stay at home parent or one where two parents (plus grandparents) are able to trade off sick days when the child is not feeling well. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, it's a tough decision you are making.|`|f46ac79782011df203ccb9768414aec1aa	your an adult hun,its your choice, you can still have a baby and finish school<br>  don't let your mum force you into something you don't want to do<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck|`|JWT4cTolaa	It will be hard but you can do it lots of girls do..my sister had a baby at 16 and she fininshed high school and nursing school it was hard but with the help of family she made it and you can to! Good Luck! |`|5hkE594Paa	your an adult and it's totally op to you is you want to keep the baby or not, but please don't abort it ! it's murder !|`|6j0Figxyaa	hi there. my daughter told me on July 22 of this year she was 7 weeks pregnant. She was 17. She did just turn 18 though end of august. anyway I said all the same things to her. we fought about it. our entire family was upset and really angry with her for all the same reasons your mother told you. My daughter was worried about everything. Now she is 20 weeks pregnant(ITS A GIRL!) And we've all come around now. We are all supportive of her. Because she showed that she would take control of this situation. Like making her ob appointments etc. She also got on the internet and reasearched schools where she could go and take the baby with her to school once its born. So now, she is in a school program called Project Teach(which i think may be in every state, not sure). She will be going to school year round. Has to wear a uniform etc. But they pick her up at her home by bus. There's a nursery in the school. So it can work out. You have to decide what is best for your life and for the life of this baby. Everybody is different and every family has their way of dealing with stressful situations like this. Try discussing things with your family again and again and again. Talk to your school counselor and anybody you can to decide what your going to do. |`|qOzGKg9paa	Well you should have thought about this first, and don't go saying this wasn't meant to happen- it was a mistake.<br>  <br>  Well let me tell you a child is NEVER a mistake, you knew the risks before you got invovled and look where it put you, I'm sorry but just think about the life of this child because that is your number one priority. You can kiss your old life and get used to a new one because your taking care of two people now.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get a job to afford the costs if you haven't already and find a school that has courses for teen parents. DO NOT give up your education.|`|vSZ3ERvfaa	hey i'm 18 and pregnant and will give birth when im 19. I think if you want to keep ur child do it anyway. Yes, school is a big priority but you can still do it even after you have your child. Your only 9 weeks. Plus when your baby is born it will push you to do a lot..including finishing school! When I first told my mom I was pregnant she was saying a lot of things because she was disappointed,too. At one point she even mentioned adoption because it's expensive and who would take care of it? But now she supports me..do what's best for you. If you want your baby..keep it. Your of legal age..it's your choice. Good luck!!|`|c98eb71d9f395894450e0f9dd3f209daaa	its ur body and u are an adult.i had an abortion before and I always wondered how that child looked. it haunted my mind for a while and I promised myself I wouldn't do it again.  Do what's in your heart. whatever u decide I am sure your mother will support your decision. |`|aevtowr5aa	Keep it or give it up for adoption. That way you dont kill it and you wont have to feel guilty. Besides you know that baby inside you already has a heartbeat right?|`|8jTIWezvaa	first and for most babies are expensive thats no lie but with the help of ur parents, getting a part time job, and cutting back on unnecessary stuff does help a lot. Just b'cuz u're gonna have a baby it doesn't mean that u can't finish school, u can thats no obstacle. An abortion is like the very last thing u do if there is no way in life u can have the kid.  Honestly its gonna be difficult but there is so much help out there especially if u go to college.  That kid is gonna change ur life and in a good way b'cuz kids only make out lives better and for fulfilling.  Do what u want don't let others tell u what to do b'cuz in the end what u do will be ur burden.  if u get rid of it u will feel bad and if u keep it, it can and prolly will make u happy.  Make sure u will be willing to sacrifice a lot b'cuz kids do take time up, u won't be able to go out as often and they need a lot of love and patience.  Writing down pro's and con's do work.  Well i wish u the best of luck do what u think is right for u and the kid and don't let others make the decision for u. 
UJaCObdyaa	Amelie Cadence is my favourite of them all.|`|2rOQyvaKaa	Pamela Anna Moore<br>  |`|bzkSIJYnaa	Most of these are great names! my least favorite would be alina. i just don't like it ... it always makes me cringe, because it has the name lina in it which i hate. Lina reminds me of lima beans. i also dislike kayla destiny, but it is better than alina. grace is nice though.<br>  <br>  in order from most prefered to least (but i love them all)1.amelie cadence - this name just flows very nicely<br>  <br>  2. taylor faith - i love taylor and faith adds some femininity to the name<br>  <br>  3. aimee bella - i prefer amy bella. this is such a sweet name<br>  <br>  4. kristen rae - these name is really nice, however i little ordinary. kristin is a better spelling. maybe spice up Kristin/Kristen with a more unique name...<br>  Kristin/Kristen Jade<br>  Kristin/Kristen Amelia<br>  Kristin/Kristen Scarlett... a few suggestions<br>  <br>  hope i helped!<br>  <br>  best wishes :) <br>     - Eva|`|RuyLwzA0aa	I love Amelie Cadence!|`|nkM6wmv6aa	Amélie Cadence is my favourite.<br>  |`|AA10325228	 Kristen Rae Moore is cute!|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Wow,most of them are gorgeous. Here's my opinion on each:<br>  <br>  Amelie Cadence-Sounds very exotic, I love french names 9/10<br>  Alina Grace-Very pretty but I do prefer Alaina 8/10<br>  Aimee Bella-I think that Aimee is beautiful but Bella sounds like a nickname. I would go with Aimee Isabella 7.5/10<br>  Kayla Destiny-Kayla is one of my favorite names but Destiny sounds a bit tacky and doesn't really match with Kayla What about Kayla Grace?? 5/10<br>  Taylor Faith-I am not a fan of unisex names but this sounds nice. It flows well with Faith too 7/10<br>  Kristen Rae-I personally don't like Kristin or any of it's variations. Rae is too masculine for me and I prefer Mae or May. 3/10<br>  <br>  My overall favourite is Amelie Cadence and Alina Grace comes in as a close second.You have a very nice taste in names :)<br>  |`|voyH3d1Kaa	Out of them I like Aimee Bella the most.

But I am a little partial my children's names are Destiney Marie, And Kali Nicole ( Kayla was my first choice but we have a Kayla on both sides of the family)  but please understand that both Kayla and Destiny are very common names. |`|azIJoIdIaa	Taylor Rose<br>  Taylor Marie<br>  Taylor Brooke<br>  Kristen Isabella<br>  Bella Grace<br>  <br>  <br>  Emily Kathryn *emma kate*<br>  Sarra Grace<br>  Emma Grace<br>  Charlotte Jade|`|hZ2uQ0E1aa	Hi,Congratulations on being pregnant!Out of all of those names,I really like Kayla Destiny.But,if you are planning on her to be a tomboy then I like Taylor|`|RWc0HUSRaa	It's a 3-way tie.

Yl79igD7aa	I think the pictures are great.  I actually subscribe to your newsletter so it's interesting and cool to be answering your question!  I am TTC and have been for over a year and these pictures, in my opinion, are great.  I mean, babies and pregnancy are the whole end result that the people you target are looking toward so if you're concerned about offending women, you certainly are not doing so, from my point of view.  The material I get from you has never been anything but tasteful.  |`|yFG0NhD4aa	I don't see anything offensive/uncomfortable about any of those pictures, fits in with the topic at hand.<br>  Will look nice when complete.<br>  You aren't telling them about babies, you are offering advice on how to live pre-baby to get to the pregnant phase, it looks good!|`|6Clgrjaoaa	I think it is nice. It's very calming and peaceful. There is nothing wrong with a mother and baby picture, it goes well with the theme. Good Luck.
I7sS4w0maa	I am a CCMA<br>  <br>  You are NOT pregnant this month.<br>  <br>  AF was Sept 1st you would not ovulate again until about the 15th it takes 3 to 5 to Fertilize and another 10 to 12 to implant which would put the implantation date around September 30 to October 1st<br>  This is October 17th <br>  You should have tested Positive already<br>  Take a Blood Test in a Week if it is a NEG than there is NO pregnancy <br>  <br>  Nala AF AUNT FLOW >> YOUR PERIOD|`|JLEx0jbXaa	you're not pregnant |`|dqDPApIKaa	whats' af?
JLEx0jbXaa	no its not u can conceive any other day but u can conceive on that day also|`|xObvZml1aa	Technically yes. The egg can't be fertilized until it is released and is usually only viable for 12-24 hours after it is released. <br>  <br>  But, sperm can stay alive in the uterus and fallopian tubes for 3-5 days, so you don't necessarily have to have intercourse on the day you ovulate. It could be almost a week before.|`|5r21ddtVaa	No. You are fertile to very fertile for five days. So you have within that time frame to concieve. If your cf becomes stretchy like egg whites, you are very fertile. When your cf becomes creamy like lotion, you want to go ahead and do the baby dance. Do it at least every other day so that your partners sperm count will be sufficient. The sperm can last up to 72 hours in your cervical fluid.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!
8f96259c0e608bb5d9863a8fab052e5baa	I am almost 8 weeks pregnant and have very sore nipples (but not boobs) so definitely is a symptom of pregnancy but not sure if you would feel it that early. I didn't until 5/6 weeks. You never know though, everyone is different! Good luck xx|`|JLEx0jbXaa	no it usually just means your period is coming but doesn't everyone get that like you said|`|5r21ddtVaa	First ask your doctor the side effects of clomid. Since you have never had this symptom before it could be the meds your taking or you could actually be pregnant. Wait and see if you flo comes and if it doesn't, get a hpt.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!|`|0jDKsz3Baa	It could be PMS..could be pregnancy..could be a lot of things.   I would wait a few days and then take an early detection test. Good lucK!|`|BmVM9pAPaa	don't know about the meds, but as for preg symptom:  no, it just means that you're hormonal.

wqAaWKi0aa	I looked in my monitor's instruction booklet, & it says if you see an exclamation mark, rectangle with a line, & a phone that your monitor isn't working.<br>  <br>  "These symbols will appear in the unlikely event of monitor failure.  They tell you that a problem has been detected.  Call the helpline at 1-800-321-EASY & they will instruct you on what to do."   <br>  <br>  Best wishes!!!<br>  <br>  |`|ZXOCI5Cnaa	I suggest you call the toll free number and don't be shy! they have heard probably just about everything before, you can always ask them at the same time for more additional information about the product that isn't available on the leaflet to be sent to your house, companies are usually more than happy to help customers, especially when it might mean more business. I remember how frustrating it was for me to get pregnant with my son and these ovulation tests were very confusing! good luck :-)|`|K3eMlCtUaa	I have one never had that happen!!

AA11215240	Go to the doctor to check to make sure everything is ok.|`|AA12197188	this is ok.  But if your concerned put a call into the doctors office and talk to a nurse.

It is totally normal and nothing to worry about.  As the baby gets bigger he/she will find all kinds of positions to get into.  Sometimes an elbow in your ribs or a foot on your side.  Believe me the baby will be more comfortable than you are.|`|f2a0aa72f606254d833ce5b691506886aa	Hey you should tell someone-mom,or dad -and maybe they will understand because they can get you to a doctor|`|AA11489247	Sounds normal to me, happened with both my pregnancies.
83ad8ea7fca7990d1bf64df9f735c296aa	What are the most common side effects of Zoloft?   Some people taking Zoloft might have some side effects. The most common Zoloft side effects are dry mouth, insomnia, sexual side effects, diarrhea, nausea, and sleepiness. Not everyone gets side effects.   If I get side effects, will they go away?   Any side effects will most likely lessen over time. Be sure to tell your doctor about any side effects you might be having. A prospective study of women followed by The California Teratogen Information Service found no increase in the rate of major anomalies in the infants of 112 women who had  used sertraline during pregnancy when compared to nonexposed controls. Anomalies reported in the sertraline exposed group included bilateral choanal atresia, valvular pulmonic stenosis with an atrial septal aneurysm, unilateral club foot, and Down syndrome in a pregnancy that was terminated.  Infants exposed to sertraline during the third trimester were more likely than controls to have neonatal transition difficulties and were more often admitted to a special care nursery [3]    Kulin NA et. al. prospectively examined 147 women who reported use of  sertraline during the first trimester pregnancy. The rates of miscarriage, stillbirth, prematurity, mean birth weight, and major malformations in the women who used sertraline were comparable to unexposed controls. Most of the women had taken 50 mg daily (range 25-250 mg/d) [4] .    hope this helps|`|58e8dd0abccadadcb49d5c752a911395aa	I would ask a doctor...I wouldnt take any til I talked to them either!!!!|`|e9d3dbb27ffd3e907c898779392ecbb4aa	God any number of things, you should seriously talk to your doctor and ask all these questions, you don't want to cause harm to your baby.
6114d6e2170ff6ace2f254a1668ef283aa	Well, I ate fast food all through my pregnancy and my baby is not fat at all.  Plus she's really healthy, but that doesn't mean that it's okay to eat fast food all of the time.  Moderation is the key.|`|3f721c56ae0005d7f8c2dbabbbe80319aa	well, It is not healthy, because all that goes to the baby, and surrounds the baby. It won't be good for you or the baby. You need to eat a lot of fruits and veggies. drink lots of water too. take care , and congrats.|`|AA12145981	it will make you overweight also think twice about that eat fruits and veggies instead or buy a  seafood meal|`|AA12362851	I don't believe it will be bad for the baby, it will be bad for you because you will get fat and then it will be difficult to lose that weight.|`|53fefaee29a047071a8753d52c5631c1aa	First, I don't think it would actually make your baby fat. I don't think fast food, per se, will be harmful to your baby. However, what may be harmful is that, by eating fast food so much, you *aren't* eating other foods which contain nutrients that the baby needs to develop properly. However, fast food in and of itself probably won't be a health issue as long as you make sure you are getting the proper nutrients.|`|AA10335018	Heartburn!|`|AA11317725	disease causing preservatives, additives, chemicals, coloring, empty calories...|`|2b03b57636ac3d2c67d120485414cfe6aa	Your baby will truly be what you eat during the first months.  You're not making him fat, you're building brain cells, muscles, bones, and vital organs.  Babies that are born to moms with poor nutrition or who are starving, generally have developmental learning problems later in life.  Eat healthy for the baby.  Plus it will be easier for you to loose the baby fat after your child is born.|`|5f25729d0c0b79595ed504f1005dc7f2aa	It certainly is not healthy for either of you. As far as anyone becoming fat.....you are what you eat. Try to stay away from fast food and eat healthy food.|`|AA10357986	It's not that fast food will make your baby fat. It will make you gain unhealthy weight very quickly. An occasional treat from fast food is okay to satisfy those cravings, but much of this is metabolized very quickly in your body to sugar. This causes undesirable weight gain during pregnancy. The excess weight you gain can put you at risk for gestational diabetes, and other problems as your pregnancy progresses.|`|076512ebc5da7cccefa2b911f148ea30aa	i dont think it will do anything i ate alot of fast food and my baby was fine and he wasnt fat 7 pounds 3oz be i gained alot of weight so maybe that aint the best thing to be eatin|`|f89316cfe4353e496a35e2be579c2c21aa	That does not determine your baby being fat... It will determine how much weight you gain. I ate lots of fast food and what ever I felt like eating and I put on plenty of wieght but neither of my girls were that big. And both were healthy... Enjoy!
2acfbf557aa74f0dda19432a2313ce4faa	There are a lot of things they say work (sex, nipple stimulation, pineapple, spicy foods, bumpy rides) but all these things seem to just make me have more braxton hicks.

I walked for about 2 hours until I felt alot of pressure in my uterus.  It's actually a technic that they use at the hosptial.  It helps you to dialate.  Or just call your doctor and complain - that worked for me too.  Told them I was having braxton hix every night and not getting a lick of sleep which was really true. They had me walk alot at the hospital and told me if after walking I dialated a little more they would induce me which they did.

Good luck|`|9fe9043219b87bc6a4240ac40443929eaa	Sex and breast and nipple stimulation help.  I know at this point the last thing you want is sex and breast and nipple stimulation, however, it does work.  It releases a hormone into your system that helps induce labor.

And he will stop soon, it's getting better.|`|rFtKFp03aa	He should stop when he gets bigger, like too big to move around that freely... maybe he is just a restless sleeper though..     I nannied for triplets, they were all sleeping in the same bed.. and would move towards each other every night...     Then we put a bigger one in a separate crib cause she slept better..     then the other two slept on opposite ends and were foot to foot basically.. in the morning the boy would be all the way at the other cozied up by his sister - now this is so cute cause they were swaddled and about 2 months old..     then when we put him in his own crib finally they moved for like another week and the stopped - kinda sad actually.. they knew they weren't together anymore..     sorry for that side note :)|`|m2aznd8xaa	my 20 month olds is a big mover too. she is now in a twin size bed and all we did was buy rails for it so she wont fall off.and they are nice mesh ones so when her face is pressed up against it its soft and breathable. you can get them at toys r us.for cheap i got two to get the whole side of the bed .if you get a toddler bed they are smaller and can get one as long as the bed is against the wall and there are no spaces between the wall and bed. if so get some for both sides. my nin year old stopped using the rails at about 4 years old|`|qGQCLFinaa	my son still is a "mover" lol he tosses & turns like crazy, I didn't worry too much, his toddler bed had rails on it so he couldn't fall out, and he's now on a twin & does just fine, he hasn't fell off yet.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter is a restless sleeper shes 14 months and has been like this since she could roll, i find her on her belly, in a ball in the corner opposite sides of teh crib, legs hanging through etc etc i cant imagine ever having her in a toddler bed as i dont think shell stop any time soon. i think when the time comes im gonna have the bed pressed agianst the wall and an oblong cushion by the side to beak a fall if it ever happens and a bed rail|`|AA11063878	My daughter is 17months, and sometimes I will find her standing up asleep with her head on the rail..no, not kidding. other times she'll be laying on her back..straight across with her legs through the rail..like as if she had been sitting up with her feet dangling over the edge..and then fell asleep? sometimes we'll find her completely uncovered holding onto all her blankets under her...and other times you find her completely under the covers..like a tent. yes I am worried about putting her in a toddler bed anytime soon..however, with my nephew? my sister in law instead laid a full sized mattress on the floor, and then she placed a gate across his bedroom door so he couldn't get up and manuever around the house at night..thats more of my concern then the baby falling out of the bed..because the beds are so close to the ground even if they did fall out..they can't really get hurt, and then you could always place cushions at the bottom..but my concern is them waking up at night..getting out of the bed, and walking around..... we placed my first daughter in a toddler bed at age 3.|`|eaFgbPD7aa	my daughter practically hangs off  her bed, its so normal. My oldest scooted all over her incubator when first born, they are just a wiggler.|`|wG9vlIoJaa	Mine still does this. And that's why he sleeps in a huge bed.  He moves a lot, but never falls (perhaps they have some sixth sense to know where the bed ends), and I've seen him getting up and down the bed on his own while half asleep, so I probably shouldn't worry.  If you're worried (and if he's no longer comfortable in a crib), just put up removable guardrails on his toddler bed.
m2aznd8xaa	you seem like a great babysitter. your doing great so far. try playing school with him. he is at a perfect  age to color read books make a pretend library if you got kiddy books and let him pick books out for you to read. teach him his colors.shapes sing songs. turn up the music and show him some moves.toddlers love to dance play dress up.play dr with his plush toys like going to the vet. play store.you can even do games like at a fair for example you can pull out various buckets pots boxes etc. and toss soft ball of rolled up socks and see how far he can toss to.put them all in a roll and the farther he gets he can get a prize like a stcker a coloring sheet or a treat of his choice.  the possiubilities are endless. you seem like a smart kid so use your imagination and have fun.|`|TOoNHNv9aa	i was going to say watch a kiddy movie with him.
3wvlYbD7aa	Stress, changes in routine, changes in appetite, etc.    Something similar happened to me.  One time my period was a month overdue (no baby sadly) and another month it came a week early.  Both of these happened within the past year.
fJiUa5ykaa	I do think you'd be allowed to foster, having a child of you own wouldn't keep them from allowing you to foster.  Having a child of you own would let them see that you have experience with kids.  If you worked full time though, you may not be allowed, cause putting the foster child into daycare would not be good, they need the security of a same person caring for them.     Here in Oregon, I doubt you'd be given a newborn right away. Though you could probably foster a toddler.    Almost all newborns in foster care here in Oregon are born addicted to Illegal drugs and you need a lot of training to care for them, that's why you wouldn't' be given a newborn right away.     I've been providing respite in the same Medical Foster home for 10 years, I care for newborns and young infants born addicted to Illegal drugs.   They can have serious problems from the exposure to drugs in Utero and need special care.|`|fjkRIUSnaa	yes they would . my ex's boyfriend's mother is a foster mom she has 3 foster kids. they range in ages from 1-6. she also has birth children as well.

X6P1q8gmaa	Engage him with holding up to your face. Talk to him, sing to him. Discover what he likes, does he like to be swung?does he liked to rocked? give some time for the two of you to bond and discover each other He will smile soon.   There is so much talk of autism in the news, don't jump to the something is wrong he as autism. talk to your doctor about child development and get some books from the library to read.|`|m2aznd8xaa	my babies first smile was a 8 weeks just try to encourage it more. he will do it on his own time.it should be anytime soon youll see.|`|NL34mhikaa	Make him smile! play around or make him laugh!! or do something he likes like give him a treat or kiss every once in a while and just be nice!
MGOFjVnVaa	only later on you will realize that it is a blessing to have such  kids. lively, curious, up to all sorts of nonsense - they are  "normal".    there were times when i also was about to strangle mine, but  they turned out to be wonderful persons. the one and only problem  is that one actually would need a 360degree field of vision and  at least four hands and a day that lasted at least 48 hours.  one has to be on the watch out all the time.    good louck to you and your nerves!|`|hRZFLRHLaa	My son is like this and is not even two.  One day i was putting groceries away and he got a bottle of laundry detergent ran to the living room and threw it against the wall .  i still have a nice blue stain on my floor. he is always getting into stuff.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	I hear you sister. Everything is an adventure with my daughter|`|m2aznd8xaa	they are very curious and mischevious at this age and all you can really do is keep eveything out of reach thats how i have my home eveything is up high and locked away . i cant have nothing nice out because you know what will happen to them.child proof eveything.its a must for now.|`|NJ5t19Vxaa	Damn maybe they are just too hyper, try giving them less fizzy drinks or things high in E-s, just re-inforce the naughty corner/step, as soon as they step out of line shout as loud as you can, don't clean it up then carry them over, just command them forcefully to do it and after you've cleaned it up tell them not to do it again or they'll be cleaning it up and they'll be on the step for longer time
9c16f104f9589fa27971d779def0ac39aa	If the condom didn't break.. I wouldn't stress.      Look into getting another form of birth control (pill, iud, patch, shot..)  so you don't have to rely just on the condom.
wND7qPTWaa	Her soul magnifies the Lord (Luke 1:46-55)! Think of what that means for just a moment.           Everything about Our Lady points straight back to the Father, Whose faithful daughter she is; to the Son, Whose mother she is; and to the Holy Ghost Who overshadowed her. There is no one in all of History whose relationship with God is as complex, fulfilled, and achingly beautiful as Mary's. She is not only the greatest of Saints, she is our Mother, as Jesus is our Brother and Savior. In honoring her, we honor Him -- and imitate Him, as we are admonished to both honor our parents and imitate Christ, Who loved His Mother.      Adam and Eve, immaculate from their first moments, prefigure Mary and Jesus, also without original sin from their conceptions -- the only four people immaculate from their first moments, creating a brillian poetic symmetry in Scripture. And as Eve through her disobedience, was the means through whom Adam brought sin into the world, Mary, the New Eve, through her obedience, was the means through whom salvation entered the world when she gave birth to her Son, the New Adam, our Savior.        Hail, Mary, Full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the Fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death.        It just strikes me as evil, this not uncommon attempt to diminish Mary's status and the unceasing accusations against Catholics of trying to raise her status to that of God's. There's something very sinister and ugly in it, and I find it offensive. We Catholics take great care in pointing out that "worship" in the sense of latria 3 is GOD'S alone -- even to the point of having separate terms for the honor and adoration due to God as opposed to the honor and veneration of the Saints -- including His greatest Saint, Mary. They are:       latria: the honor due to God alone   dulia: the honor due to human creatures worthy of respect   hyperdulia: the honor due to Mary as God's greatest creation and our Queen Mother         To love Mary takes nothing at all from Christ, but honors our Blessed Lord by Whose grace she is who she is: His greatest creation, the greatest of Saints, the Queen of Heaven, the Immaculate Conception, the spotless Virgin, the Ark of the Covenant, the New Eve, the mother of God, and the mother of Israel -- our mother who wants nothing more for us than to pray for us and show us her Son.|`|y4XaIoxZaa	what???? more explanation needed.|`|9xUwXy95aa	You get the message in your inbox?

084f7ff9e61c7e14d51c6fd2ba9c8ba3aa	This is an urban legend.  If you're serious about becoming pregnant, consult a medical doctor who is a fertility specialist.    The best a love song can do is make you more relaxed and emotionally receptive to your partner.  Anything from Ross & Richie's "Endless Love" to Ravel's "Bolero".  It is really up to you & your taste.  Also makes a nice tale to tell your child when he or she is old enough.  "Honey, your dad put on Marvin's 'Let's Get It On' the night that you were conceived...."|`|AA11896942	Sorry, a song will not help achieve pregnancy.

TN3Sthbwaa	I get up at 730 and get my girls up and ready for school, their stepdad drives them in the winter, we walk in the spring and fall.  Clean the apt. while my son watches cartoons or "helps" me.  Relax with a cup of coffee and a book before lunch, make lunch and put my son down for his nap.  While he is napping I post pictures to my blog Envisage365, its a collective 365 photo blog with about 30 women participating, when the boy wakes up we play for a bit until his sisters get home from school, or we leave to walk and get them.  Evenings in the winter are terribly boring, i hate cold so stay in most of the time, during other seasons we would go for walks to the park or bikerides around the neighborhood.  Our apt has a pool so we use that in the summer, our oldest has expressed interest in tennis this year so we are going to using the tennis courts this year too.  Mostly these days it is dinner, bathtime time, play time, story time, bedtime.  Then my husband and i relax and watch a movie before we go to bed.  We watched Milk last night, i was not impressed with it.|`|MVgm17o3aa	on weekdays, I get up at 7 am to get my daughter breakfast and make sure she gets ready..i brush my teeth, get changed...I take my 11 yr old daughter to school at 7:40 am, wake my 3 yr old son up at 7:30 a.m. and put him in the car with us while i am driving my daughter to school, come home, let my son watch t.v. while i am getting his  breakfast ready..at the same time, his daddy is up and in the shower getting ready to go to work..he leaves..me and my son play or he plays something by himself and then i put my son in for his nap from 11:45 am to 1:45 p.m. while he is in for his nap, I shower,  watch t.v., clean, surf answers then i get him up at 1:45 and go get my daughter...sometimes, we will go to the park or shopping after that or come home and play some more(daughter goes and play with her friends expect on tuesdays is gymnastics and tuesday is track) until dinner at 6 pm..feed the kids...son goes to bed at 8 p.m. daughter is in bed at 9:30 p.m. my honey arrives home between 8 and 10 p.m. and then, me and my honey chill and then go to bed at 11pm to do it all over again tomorrow.|`|ZHfvcyjXaa	Get up about 7:30 put on coffee get my daughter changed,dressed breakfast.Clean my house laundry,Play with my daughter watch my general hospital go to work come home cook for my family,Give baby bath bottle bed.Take a little time to my self and go to bed|`|H4a6uSiyaa	Wake up at 6:10 (I envy you who get up at 7:30!)

Fix him a snack or lunch.   Get my kids from school at 2:00.  Do some craft or fun activity with them.  Husband gets home at 5 ish.  Make dinner.  Eat at 5:40ish.  Clean up until 6:10ish.  Help 6 year old shower.  Bathe the three year olds and 1 year old.  Watch part of a Disney movie with the kids.  Get everyone in a bed and asleep.  Talk and Watch T.V. with my husband til 10:30.  Fall asleep.  Shower somewhere inbetween!  Hope for a change of schedule the next day.|`|PwrF9OtWaa	get up around 10:30-11 (i'm no good before mid-morning!).   change the baby's diaper then i check the daily news on the computer and play on the internet for a half hour and wait for my little guy to get hungry while he climbs on stuff.   then i make and feed max breakfast. i get him cleaned up and in some warm clothes, wash my face, brush my teeth, put on some sweats, and we take the dog on a looooong walk. max takes his nap in the stroller.  then we come home and i make max lunch. then he climbs on stuff some more while i pick up the house, clean the kitchen, do the laundry, blah blah blah.  then my husband comes home and he rocks max to sleep for his nap while i make dinner, and i'm starving because i haven't eaten anything but some snacks here and there all day.  then chris (husband) and i usually watch tv and eat in peace while max's sleeps.  then it's max's dinner time and i feed him and we all just relax in the living room for a while.  then i take a nice long bath around 10 or so while chris rocks max to sleep (max will only accept if it's his daddy!).  i usually get to bed around 12 or so (1 or 2 if i mess around on ANSWERS!) right after having some alone time with chris. :)    usually the only variation to this schedule is if we go to the library instead of on our walk, or if we go to target or walmart when chris gets home!    sometimes i will crave adult company and call a friend (none of which have kids) to see if they want to come over and hang out with me and max in the afternoon! kinda pathetic... haha.|`|QC7i71mFaa	mines almost the same, i dont cook for their dad at breakfast thou-he can sort himself out i will do his tea thou, my eldest is only in nursery thou so i get an extra trip at lun ch to pick him up and then try to amuse him in afternoon maybe going to childrtens centre.    r your weekends not more varied thou?
vjsT8DMIaa	My friends baby was like that too...but I also take into consideration...how often are they eating...how big were they at birth...is she just sticking a bottle in his mouth every time he cries...I mean, some babies are just hungry...yes, sometimes they can be overfed...especially if they are just getting a bottle every time they cry, instead of trying to find out what else is wrong...but if they aren't throwing it back up, and aren't eating 8 oz every 2 hours...it may be just what the baby needs. One babies eating practice may not be the same as anothers.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my cousin in law said her son was drinking 10 ozs the day he left the hospital. all babies are different|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	to much thats why hes puking|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	wow. that doesnt sound normal lol. your supposed to feed the baby when their hungry but ive never heard of a month old baby taking 8 ounces at a time.  what did he weigh at birth ?|`|AC044ccpaa	Hi If you tell me your baby's weight in Kilogrammes i'll work it out for you...|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	All babies are different.  This could be true.  By six weeks one of my babies was drinking eight ounces every two hours.  By eight weeks my third child, my son was drinking ten ounces every two hours.  They were nine pounds nine ounces and nine pounds five ounces at birth.  Babies know when they have had enough and will not drink anymore.  A better reason why the baby is throwing up is that he is intollerant to the formula.  Is it spit up... which is a small amount of ingested formula, or throwing up which is curdled food and a large amount?  If it is just a small amount then this is normal.  Many babies spit up.

In some ways i know how you feel.|`|ADtfT5L3aa	omg i am so sorry... i am 15, have never been pregnant, but i know someone who had a miscarriage and got pregnant about a year later. it is not safe before a year, because i know another person who had a miscarriage and she got pregnant again after about 5-6 months, even though her doctor told her to wait a year and miscarried again, so you might not want to try for a year.    good luck!!|`|oDL02s8kaa	I'm sorry but I completely agree with Maddox!!!

Fresh air and walking helps... dont shut yourself out remember you are young and everything is still in a front...try spending more time with Harry and try to get over it... when you will Relax and be Calm it will be so much easier to fall pregnant...

I unfortunatly miscarried again at 5 weeks, bled for a few days and started trying again right away. It took us 4 months and 3 cycles to conceive again and here I am 6w3d pregnant and all is well for the moment (and I pray it will stay this way)  Though I've miscarried twice I can't even imagine what you are going through.

Shes not being horrible or selfish. I lost my baby at 12 wks and it broke my heart, but on the other hand i felt lucky i had my lil girl molly. it does take time to get over it and it will always be in your mind hun. It took me a good 4 months to get over it as i had to go down for an operation. It was natures way of telling something was wrong with your little girl. I hope you don't blame your self.

I am so so sorry for your loss, i always followed your questions and answers and i really do feel for you at this time.  I went through a lot in 2008 having suffered 3 miscarriages, the furthest along was a missed miscarriage at 12weeks.  After my 1st m/c i got pregnant again straight away after this with no period in between, apparently you are at your most fertile straight after a miscarriage.  However, please ensure you are emotionally ready for this, you may think you are as you had wanted this baby so much but i think you should allow yourself a bit of time to recover from your ordeal.  When the time is right it will happen again for you, i had hoped to start 2009 a fresh and then i had the accident which has knocked me for 6 again, however once again i believe god works in mysterious ways.  I wish you the best of luck and my thoughts are with you at this time.    God bless|`|5s828HVMaa	I'd leave it it a while i no its hard but u need to get over it emotionly first plus your body needs time to recover. i'd give it a few months yet. thinking of u hun :)|`|8N1U6GEZaa	My deepest sympathy on your loss, I lost a baby at 29 weeks, I bled for about 6-7 weeks, I was advised to let my body recover before trying again. But it's only you who knows when your ready.I fell pregnant straight away, with identical twin girls.
zAKFuGGiaa	It's a personal preference and it depends on one's financial situation... I have always wanted at least three, maybe four but no more than four... Right now I have one three year old daughter and I'm not in a rush to have any more anytime soon... I'm a senior in college and my fiancee and I are in the process of planning out wedding. I want to be finished with school, get married and settle down before thinking about having more children.|`|8Qbx8PDnaa	AFTER THIS CHILD ITS GOING TO BE MY 2ND AND THATS ABOUT IT I AND MY HUSBAND DONT WANT NO MORE , ITS ALOT OF MONEY TRUST MEH AND WELL WE ARE NOT LIVING IN BACK N THE DAYS TO HAVE SO MUCH CHILDREN ONLY HILLBILLYS HAVE SO MUCH CHILDREN  NOW IN DAYS|`|ojwRgCLqaa	I think the house would be way too crazy with 4. You'd always be taking kids places and doing stuff for them and never for you. My mom only has 3 and she's so busy with us and a job. I don't recommend 1, because they will probably get lonely. 2 is good because the will have someone to play with and they will learn to share. 3 in my opinion is fine but quite crazy. I can only imagine what 4 would be like. Good luck with whatever you choose.|`|nXNabe3Uaa	My mom and dad have four kids! so i guess not. They wanted 12! i'm 13 and i want to have 3 kids.|`|EcsJaYjmaa	No, not too many at all! My great-grandmother had 10 kids, and my great-great grandmother had 23!!! (they didn't have tv)    Personally i think 2 or 3 is a good number. You don't want to spend all your adult life gestating and having sleepless nights. I'd say 2 or 3 a couple of years apart.    I'm 21 and have a 3 year-old daughter and another on the way - i plan for these 2 to be 'it'. then i'm 'done' - still can't persuade my husband to get a vasectomy though!|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	I think four kids is fine as long as you wait.     I'm one of four and I've always thought about having around four kids. I'll probably end up having three though. I'm just going to wait until I have the first one and go from there. : )    I'm 18, BTW and don't want kids until my late 20's.    The number of kids a person wants is just based on their preferences, how they were raised, how they want to raise their kids, and whether they have enough room and money, etc.|`|5kgCYM5Caa	Depends but always be sure that you have enough money for the amount of kids you are going to have. But aren't you a bit too young to be thinking about kids right now im 16 and I'm still thinking about how babies are gross|`|cnulCeFaaa	It might be too many, but if you want it that's fine. It will be a lot of work for sure. Just talk to my grandma who had 15 children.
AA11896942	The real concern is the level of mercury in the fish.  A fetus would be much more sensitive to mercury poisoning than an adult would, so a pregnant woman should avoid fish that are known to have high levels of mercury, like shark, swordfish and white snapper (among others).  And of course, all fish should be well-cooked.  No sushi for mamas-to-be.  Since lots of different types of fish have some degree of mercury, it's probably wise to keep it down to one or two portions of fish per week.  It's not necessary to eliminate fish completely because they can be a good source of protein and those omega-whatevers.|`|93f513ce64844986c2721e87bf39e846aa	Yes and no, like tuna good shark bad. there's something in it that my doc told me not to eat to much of when I was prego. just don't eat to much and I think she'll be fine|`|fc6faf8beab8f1ed9e73efd38e8dc9fbaa	you can. just avoid certain kinds. like shark swordfish. and something else    go to womenshealthcaretopics.com    they have a list on there.  they want you to avoid certain types cause they mercury in them which can cause you to abort. also see a nutrionist.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	Yea, bad to eat sushi... The fish will eat the baby!|`|0ece33e597ee68008a36eeda3a76a672aa	True... fish contains Murcey which is Bad for the unborn baby. No more that Once a month is recomended. And no fish you caought yourself!|`|0995d23ff0d0176382c3f24933ca13e3aa	it's the mercury you need to watch out for. Otherwise fish is good, as is generally getting a balanced diet, for pregnant women.    In addition to other warnings, beware of canned tuna. I hear it has a lot of mercury in it.    flu shots have mercury in them, too and this is flu shot season so if you know someone whos pregnant, they might want to skip the flu shot, too.|`|2e040ee8d20979ba052108c984af80edaa	That is way false.    Coach|`|0c4b92ceef1e027734ea78c8fe4fd5c0aa	Pregnant women should avoid raw fish, including sushi and shellfish, and they should limit their intake of large fish, such as swordfish and tuna, they shouldn't eat it more than once a week.|`|4dbdfe52a83c22ca0376e3f21461cd67aa	yes its true the level of Mercury in the fish is harmful for the baby developing
120a834b257ee58916e73d4b3f37eaa3aa	Dizziness is not a great pregnancy symptom. Mmmm that means that you had intercourse during your menses? (correct?) That would be a bit early to conceive as you usually ovulate (put out an egg) 14 days prior to the onset of your menses. His sperm usually lives about 3-5 days and the egg more like 3 days, which means you can usually become pregnant if you have unprotected sexual relations about 3 days before you ovulate to about 3 days after you ovulate. If you are 28 days and regular that would mean you usually ovulate on about day 14. So sexual relations without protection would need to occur on or about day 11 to day 17. Dates 2 days earlier or later are less possible, but not impossible to conceive. My bet is that you are not... Just an educated guess though. If you did have unprotected relations before day 7 and conceived on day 14 (unlikely) then by day 24 you would trigger most over the counter urine pregnancy tests. So it seems that your at day 21in your cycle and should be looking for a reliable over the counter urine pregnancy testing kit at a local pharmacy to be used in about 3 days to be more positive that you did not get pregnant.|`|0a95d8c3d12418145b2bead1e9aa0a40aa	Hi there, Here are some symptoms of pregnancy, check them and then see your doctor    Tender, swollen breasts  One of the early signs of pregnancy is sensitive, sore breasts caused by increasing levels of hormones. The soreness may feel like an exaggerated version of how your breasts feel before your period. Your discomfort should diminish significantly after the first trimester, as your body adjusts to the hormonal changes.     Fatigue  Feeling tired all of a sudden? No, make that exhausted. No one knows for sure what causes early pregnancy fatigue, but it's possible that rapidly increasing levels of the hormone progesterone are contributing to your sleepiness.    You should start to feel more energetic once you hit your second trimester, although fatigue usually returns late in pregnancy when you're carrying around a lot more weight and some of the common discomforts of pregnancy make it more difficult to get a good night's sleep    Nausea or vomiting  If you're like most women, morning sickness won't hit until about a month after conception. (A lucky few escape it altogether.) But some women do start to feel queasy a bit earlier. And not just in the morning, either  pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting can be a problem morning, noon, or night.    About half of women with nausea feel complete relief by the beginning of the second trimester. For most others it takes another month or so for the queasiness to ease up.     Increased sensitivity to odors  If you're newly pregnant, it's not uncommon to feel repelled by the smell of a bologna sandwich or cup of coffee and for certain aromas to trigger your gag reflex. Though no one knows for sure, this may be a side effect of rapidly increasing amounts of estrogen in your system. You may also find that certain foods you used to enjoy are suddenly completely repulsive to you.     Abdominal bloating  Hormonal changes in early pregnancy may leave you feeling bloated, similar to the feeling some women have just before their period arrives. That's why your clothes may feel snugger than usual at the waistline, even early on when your uterus is still quite small.     Frequent urination  Shortly after you become pregnant, you may find yourself hurrying to the bathroom all the time. Why? Mostly because during pregnancy the amount of blood and other fluids in your body increases, which leads to extra fluid being processed by your kidneys and ending up in your bladder.    This symptom may start as early as six weeks into your first trimester and continue or worsen as your pregnancy progresses and your growing baby exerts more pressure on your bladder.     A missed period  If you're usually pretty regular and your period doesn't arrive on time, you'll probably take a pregnancy test long before you notice any of the above symptoms. But if you're not regular or you're not keeping track of your cycle, nausea and breast tenderness and extra trips to the bathroom may signal pregnancy before you realize you didn't get your period.     Your basal body temperature stays high  If you've been charting your basal body temperature and you see that your temperature has stayed elevated for 18 days in a row, you're probably pregnant    Good luck.    *-*|`|AA12173427	it means you have a yeast infection dude hahah thats sick|`|AA10530337	It could be. It wasn't for me though.|`|1e149db5ea33ec0dd0234fa56494d5cdaa	yes in some cases it is but just wait and see if you get your period|`|bb4be32ed087288e357cf19a1cfe9e70aa	You might be but according to your time line you probably aren't but not all women's body cycles are regular.  Dizziness is associated with many things.  You might be getting an ear infection, cold, flu, exhaustion, lack of sleep, stress, and so many other things.    I wouldn't think anything of it unless your period is late.|`|a0ab752824276ef45520ff42c98d2e61aa	Dizziness can be a sign of being pregnant but, I didn't get dizzy until I was HUGE!!!  If you do take a test now it could be to early to tell so, your best bet is to wait until about one week after you would normally start your period.      Good Luck!!!!|`|7ebd602f62643c71c13a76dd4b58ac41aa	it was for me yes and i ran a fever|`|46cd997536c6fd176cc28fbb4951d29faa	did u do it on your safe time?? that is after 10 days of your PMS? then you are not...if u didn't then u might wanna take a test..but wait until your next PMS...good luck on what ever u want..:D|`|1687a4ce7dda4a57b119e37a9a69f1a5aa	yes it is..take a test & find out.
AA11896942	Do you mean to ask what are good eating habits to enhance your fertility?  I don't think there are any particular foods to make you more fertile, but there are things you can do to make sure you're healthy when you do get pregnant.  For example, quit consuming alcohol and caffeine, seriously cut down or quit junk food like fast food and sweets, don't smoke or do recreational drugs.  If you're taking prescription medication, check with your doctor to make sure they're okay in the event that you conceive while you're on the medication.  Take prenatal vitamins.  Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean meats.  Drink milk or get your calcium somehow.    Good luck!|`|AA11656175	I have read that drinking 1 cup of green tea will help increase the cervical fluid that allows sperm to move freely.  But try for the decaf kind, since you should try to cut down/out cafieene (sp).  Good luck... I'm working on it this month too.  I have been drinking 1 cup a day, no coffee, taking ovulex, and also using the clearblue easy fertility monitor.|`|cb5d88739c4f70cdc7a626b2b8a791f7aa	fruits, vegetables, salads, milk, cheese, eggs, and lean meats such as turkey and chicken

6fiYhtACaa	I think it's outrageous and disturbing. This woman has a psychiatric history and is a single woman with six kids already!!!! I would question her motives if she had all the money in the world but let's get real here - she has no husband and relies on her aging parents to help her with childcare. From the sounds of it, they already had their hands full with the six as one or some of them is autisitic. Grandma is tired! Raising a single child is hard. I can not fathom bringing eight babies into the mix of 6 little kids and I'm from a big family myself (1 of 9). Who's gonna pay for all of this???? Guess what? you and I will!! It is roughly $400,000 per baby for just the hospital expenses alone. Do the math for just the eight babies times 18 years and I think even Bill Gates and Trump would get sticker shock. This is such an abuse of IVF and a slap in the face to all the couples out there who desperately want a child and use these technologies responsibly. Whomever the doctor is who implanted this crazy woman should have his or her license yanked. It's ultimately the kids who will suffer. And please don't compare this to the Duggar family. Those kids are all well-taken care of and paid for by their parents, not government funding. Plus they were conceived in the natural fashion.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	I agree with you.  I do think she is in for a very hard ride, but she has 8 precious babies.|`|yB5go5wbaa	I have mixed feelings about it, because the woman already had 6 children, all of whom are very young (I can't remember the ages, but I do believe all are under TEN).  The mother is also young - I think she's 33 or something like that.    I don't know what doctors who were treating her were thinking...she didn't have problems conceiving, obviously.  Another article I read said she conceived all of them through IVF, but that was obviously something that was working for her, so I don't see why she or the doctors would implant all of those embryos.  She did find out that she had 7 multiples, and agree not to selectively reduce them, so she must have thought she could take care of them, but I think that the doctors should have not placed that many in there in the first place.  However, now that she's got them, I hope the best for her and her family and would help babysit if I could... :)|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	hey better her than me|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	i think the media makes a story out of anything possible.|`|xBd96wvRaa	I think she was very irresponsible.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't know if it was the most responsible thing on her part but whats done is done.  I mean its her life but you have to wonder did she do this because she maybe thought there would be some financial gain from the publicity?  She had 6, filed bankruptcy and then thinks its a great time to get pregnant?  But her dad comes in as a hero and goes to Iraq to risk his life and help support them.  Sounds like an elaborate way to get on a million tv talk shows and get all kind of gifts.  But who am I to judge...just my opinion.  Meanwhile has anyone investigated the doctor who thought implanting 8 embryos was ethical?  Seems like he is looking for 15 minutes of fame too.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my opinion is im past caring hearing about it lol its everywhere i look i dont care if shes on state married or whetever i just hope her babies are raised well and thats that:)))|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	She's going to have her hands full with 6 others at home as well.  I agree that she shouldn't have done selective abortion, but what type of doctor would put 8 live embryos in a woman under 35!|`|c01eb38fba09582c78fbc7a2a19baeb0aa	1/  It's quite an accomplishment; let's face it, doesn't happen every day.    2/  Probably the more people know about it, the more help she'll get coming; I think I remember seeing this kind of public reaction (the help) in the past.    3/  Must suck to be her.|`|iW6iJBCEaa	That's got to hurt is she had one baby after another. She won't be able to sit for a week probably lol|`|AgPDg010aa	I think it was very selfish of her to have that many children. She is relying on her parents to raise her children and support her which to me is terrible. What type of life are those children going to have? But I do think she will have a lot of help from the media and community and I'm sure thats a good thing for all the children involved.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Stories like these make headlines for a reason. Often times they spark debates with peoples' morals and values, which is exactly what this story does. In this day and age, we know very well that with one turn of an event that is unusual or strange it can be plastered everywhere. In a way she brought it upon herself, and instead of trying to turn the story around and make it positive, she's being reclusive, which just lets people speculate even more. She has the chance to set the record straight, but she's not. Stuff happens.|`|83a276b47bb00ebd2bf1491598f2a83caa	That woman should be charged for all of those kids she has. Singles and childless couples get taxed heavily because they have no dependents to claim in their w-2s. I wish i could claim my TWO DOGS!!! (seriously).|`|CoSdW7xQaa	Personally, I don't think it's any ones business besides herself. I understand that it's a wow thing because of all the babies she had but it's over and they should leave her alone now. I'm sure it's gonna be tons and tons of work but she'll have plenty of support from her family and her community. She'll be fine in the end.|`|uuKTQ84Qaa	MY opinion is the same it will be very hard to  take care of   eight babies|`|5edc4c06e43679e2ec64a4f4b601fed1aa	I personally don't see anything wrong with having that many children. If you can afford them!   But how anyone could afford 14 children I don't know.  Now I don't know her situation so I can't judge her. But it seems to me that she may have gotten in over her head.   But like someone else said. I'm glad she didn't abort any of them.|`|FidZNMmUaa	I am happy we are informed about the miracle. I think people should quit judging.|`|mlwBLJHaaa	I think that family should get a t.v. show like jon&kate plus 8 and 18 and counting, so they can pay for there bills. I heard they are like almost 1 mill in det. Or I think her hubby should get a really hella good paying job so they don't get eaten out of their house and home for crying nout loud. Plus if they don't do the show thing then everybody like those reporters should ****** leave them alone, nobody wants reporters surrounding them, not even famous people.|`|VDdEMPsdaa	selfishness... so many kids needing a mother and she makes 8 more, in total i think she got 14 now, selfish sow.|`|mVXBOI6Qaa	We have different opinions...  I think this woman is OBSESSED with having children, as the womans own mother has now stated.  It may not be that she really wants them, but actually obsessed with having them.  Of course, she will love them and care for them the best she can, but is that going to be enough???  If you have not seen in the news this morning, they have released her name and the fact that ALL of her children were by in vitro and that her mother is NOT happy!  This woman has lost or is losing support from her financially unstable family, whom which she lives with!!!  Her mother has also stated that she did NOT support her daughter when she decided to have the 8 embryos implanted and that when she gets out of the hospital, she will be gone, and that she can not go on any longer!  This is not a good situation.  The have also released that this woman is SINGLE!!!  This woman now has 14 children all under the age of 7!  I'm sorry, but I think that is way too many for a single woman!  Just think of the worst that could and could VERY possibly happen....this woman could get extremely burned out, especially since she's losing support from her family, and something bad could happen to either the mother or any of her children.  Now, is that fair to any of the children?  If something should happen to the mother it will be nearly impossible to keep all of those children together until they are all grown.  It seems to me she never thought of any of those children before she decided to do this.  Six kids is one thing, but 8 more on top of that is too much.    I also don't believe in freezing embryos...I think it's wrong.  Also, what kind of fertility doctor would do that to a single woman, especially one that is financially unstable.  It seems to me that he did this for the publicity, and as soon as they release his name, he will get that and it won't be all positive!  I think this is a VERY BAD situation!  Again, not everyone has the same opinion I do.
z3uvkxkYaa	When a parent chooses to sign over his parental rights, that means all rights...no longer responsible for the child..including child support.    UPDATED INFORMATION FOUND FOR YOU:    From what I am reading, the parent who wants to give up rights can do so, however it may not allow them to give up child support, especially if that is the reason they are doing it..but it depends upon the judge. A parent can voluntarily sign over his rights on grounds of abandonment. Basically he will have to go to court, and the court will decide whether or not he will be able to give up his parental rights. So you do not have to agree or disagree, but the parent that would like to sign off his rights needs to have a case in court as to why..and more then likely if it is just to get out of child support...it won't happen.    The link I posted states the laws of PA    UPDATE: PA laws listed on first link:|`|7IRbqNC7aa	No, you just dont do anything with the child in person, you no longer have any rights to how the child is raised or what school it goes to but you still need to pay for the childs needs since it was created in part by you.|`|FpArsFcJaa	If a father signs away his rights, he no longer pays child support.  And he no longer has any rights to see the child.  It doesn't matter if the mother agrees or not.    If you have this happen, consider adoption unless you have really great means to support the child yourself.|`|voKnIZ6Waa	1-you have to agree for him to sign over his rights.     2- most likely a judge wont let you do it even if you agree unless there is someone else to adopt the child in the fathers place     3- if he does somehow sign over his rights successfully then no he does not have to pay child support from the time his rights are signed away on. |`|Ff7mCzlPaa	The first answer you received is absolutely correct.  |`|xXnFx6qLaa	I am almost 100% positive you have to agree to let him sign over his rights.    If he does sign over his rights, he will not be responsible for support.    HOWEVER - I don't know how PA works, but in my state (VA) it's not really easy for a man to sign over his rights.  They only allow it in *extreme* situations.  If I were you, I would contact Juvenile courts in the area you live, they would be able to give you more of your state's related information.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	If he gives up his right to his child, he is no longer the guardian and has no responsibilities to the child nor have to pay child support. |`|b14a0fc0b78bf7fb15f9821058ac3eeeaa	If the father gives up his child legally then he no longer has a child support obligation because he's no longer legally the father of that child.

R4WX5twzaa	You don't usually have your period the first month of pregnancy. If you're worried you're pregnant, just wait and see if you miss your period. If you do, take a pregnancy test. Although, if you're really stressing out about being prego, you may miss your period anyway, so don't panic if the test is negative, it's probably right. Pregnancy tests are designed to be 99% effective after your first missed period. Also, if you take one, do it with your first pee in the morning because that is when the pregnancy hormone would be the most concentrated and would give you the most accurate result.

My little boy who would have turned 11 this years name was Donovan. He died of SIDS. His daddy/my husband just loved that name so much that I couldn't even give my .02. Good thing I liked it.

In fact, have Donovan and his foot print tattoed on me :)

Rvt3tWUyaa	Cherche des prenoms pas trop originaux pour le bebe (un prenom trop original est mauvais pour l'enfant...les instit' ne seront jamais capables de retenir toutes les inventions actuelles). Prends quelque chose qui existe deja.    Evite les prenoms a la mode commeTheo, Max, Leo, Hugo, Noa, ....ca datera trop.Un exemple bete, ma mere s'appelle Christiane, toutes les Christiane(s) ont son age, mon cousin Stephane a l'age de tous les Stephane... Sebastien, Frederic, Laurent, meme s'il y a des exceptions d'autres ages, tu pourra retrouver leur age facilement par leur prenoms (et quand on sera vieux, on aura des prenoms de vieux...il ne faut pas oublier qu'un bebe, ca grandit...)    Evite aussi les prenoms style diminutif qui donnent plus la sensation qu'on parle a un chien qu'a un enfant. (exemple avec Max cite precedemment, appelle plutot un enfant Maxime civilement que Max, ou Thomas civilement et appelle le Tom dans la vie si tu veux...imagine que ton enfant soit brillant et devienne directeur d'entreprise ou veuille devenir president de la republique francaise, il aura besoin d'un prenom qui ne soit pas ridicule dans ce cas, un prenom qui ne fasse pas seulement "mignon".    Bien sur, il faut quelque chose qui sonne bien avec le nom de famille.    Personellement, les prenoms que j'aime bien sont plutot traditionels, donc je ne pense pas que ce que j'aime te plaira forcement, mais il faut bien reflechir quand on donne un prenom a un enfant, c'est pour la vie.    regarde eventuellement dans les prenoms regionaux aussi, il y en a des tres beaux    Personnellement, j'aime bien Armel, Gabriel, Daniel, Raphael, Emile, Eude, Adrien, Alban...Mine de rien, ils peuvent etre "originaux" ces prenoms...    bon courage dans la quete du ou des prenoms...et beaucoup de bonheur avec le petit a venir!|`|766f0c11cd476cfe4d9a756c3d913d59aa	Avrlian (prononce le "an") comme "ane" !|`|880535a4c17e230b513487f864f8671eaa	j'viens de lire que qqn aurait bien appel son fils Zeus.. comme originalit, tu peux pas mieux faire.  reste  savoir si tu veux qu'on se foute de son prnom  l'cole..   non, sans blague, il est difficile de conseiller les prnoms, quand on voit des "brandon, brian et jordan"  tous les coins de rue, j'peux pas cautionner!!|`|8c8f983a1918474a4614192afc22d0c2aa	Adonis|`|qnlFGCfraa	Oust Junior|`|02Fb7At0aa	cloche|`|bcba32ab82b83a63bd38991eb20149eeaa	YOAn, azad,mathis|`|1b33e9143b0c17dc20879210772a0891aa	andy|`|JXyH1Z9Laa	Tho  Matto  Killian  Alexis|`|lKfK5b40aa	Alexandre|`|UjCwHbJ7aa	Moi j'opterai pour Yoah, j'adore aussi Yannis.|`|5c20c45b0c99dcff3f93287ad5560562aa	Armel cite  precedemment, je ne peux que aimer!!!!

FmSWPS7Paa	3 1/2!!!!!!!!!!!!! my son was way too stubborn. tthats why it took so damnn long lol. anyways he really wanted to be apart of swim lessons that were offered by his dayccare. so he definitley needed to be trained. we just took him off the diapers and put him in a gitch and kept asking/reminding him to go potty. eventually he got the hang of it and did not need a reminder anymores. he later on pooped in the toliet all by himself and he was very happy he did this all by himself. it takes a lot of encourgament for the little guys. i also heard that if you put cherrios in the toilet and let him :shoot" them it works. so dont give up on him. make potty training the number one thing everyday until he gets the point. its not all that bad if you stick to it esp with a stubborn little guy|`|fYL7zRFOaa	my son is almost 3 and we are trying everything to get him to potty but he has no interest what so ever. kids are different and girl train better than boys. all i can do is keep it up till he does get trained and be patient.|`|xV0APOtaaa	Boys are statistically slower. My daughter turned 2 in October and is almost fully potty trained already. My brothers were closer to 4. The signs they tell you to look for is that he can tell you he has gone, understands where to go, and if he can wake up from a 1-2 hour nap with a dry diaper (shows he can control his bladder). Other than that it's just going to take time.    GOOD LUCK|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I STARTED potty training at 2 and they were completely potty trained by 3.  There is nothing wrong with a two year old not being potty trained yet.  He will get there when he's ready- just be patient.

Check out this short article with great tips!  http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|Ihfq3Ih5aa	Thousands upon thousands of dollars.    But you have plenty of time to start saving, it takes months, even years to even be considered as a prospective adoptive parent.  Then there is always the prospect of many adoptions falling through.    It's a very complicated process, honestly, I wouldn't just set out for a newborn boy.  Newborns, in a sense, are 'snapped up' quickly. Try broadening your options a little.    It will cause less heartache.|`|r3DPvVRuaa	it's  not just saving your money that you have to do, you have to go through a lot of other complicated crap as well. call your local adoption agency. some couples have to wait years before they are approved and can get a child.|`|5EDfm886aa	i thought it was free... have you tried having kids? maybe i could help :)
mvKbfkhGaa	I don't think I could be much help to you but I just wanted to say I think your little one sounds soooo cute and creative....it sounds to me like he likes to do things with his hands so I would suggest something he could make and give it to his dad (if possible) he'll definitely want to make it since it's going to someone very special to him. One idea you could use is to make a macaroni neck-lace....all you need is elbow macaroni, long string, and markers (optional) so he can color the pieces if he wants then he could make his dad a card or something and give it to him....he'll feel soooooo proud of himself because HE made it.....good luck and I hope "Kaden"( if that's how you spell it) likes the idea...lol!|`|b5be8abd671c44145f9f8e90b34b25ecaa	http://littlekittle.com/blog/2008/02/16/...    here's a website i found for the play dough|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Rubbery Playdough   2 cups baking soda  1 1/2 cups water  1 cup cornstarch      Mix with a fork until smooth. Boil over medium heat until thick. Spoon onto plate or wax paper.       Nature's Playdough  1 cup flour  1/2 cup salt  1 cup water  2 tablespoons oil  2 tablespoons cream of tartar  beet, spinach, and carrot juice      Mix flour, salt and oil, and slowly add the water. Cook over medium heat, stirring until dough becomes stiff. Turn out onto wax paper and let cool. Knead the playdough with your hands until of proper consistency. Use as is, or divide into balls and add a few drops of the vegetable juices to make green, pink, and orange.       Playdough   4 cups flour  1/4 cup powdered tempera  1/4 cup salt  1 1/2 cups water  1 tablespoon oil      Mix together flour, powdered paint and salt. Mix water and oil, and food coloring if desired. Gradually stir the water and oil mix into the flour mix. Knead the playdough as you add the liquid. Add more water if too stiff, more flour if sticky.       Alum Playdough   2 cups flour  1 cup salt  2 tablespoons alum  1 cup water  2 tablespoons oil  liquid food coloring      Pour dry ingredients into large pan. Stir together to mix. Stir oil and food coloring into the water. Pour liquid into the dry ingredients while mixing, squeezing and kneading the playdough. If too sticky, add more flour. Keeps best in the fridge.       Just Like the Real Playdough (so they say)  1 cup flour  1 cup water  1 tablespoon oil  1 tablespoon powdered alum  1/2 cup salt  2 tablespoons vanilla  food coloring      Mix all dry ingredients. Add oil and water. Cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until reaching the consistency of mashed potatoes. Remove from heat and add vanilla and food coloring. Divide into balls and work in color by kneading the playdough.

JnLoHaoAaa	I know you don't want to hear this but take a test. Those are symptoms, but there is no way to tell. It might be you are just sick or stressed. They sell tests at the Dollar Tree.|`|gM4exZNEaa	Sounds like you are. Take a test and find out for sure.|`|a961b1c12764a39cd7c451fb25caa829aa	no one on here can tell you if you are pregnanct or not.  the best thing to do is to go to the store and buy a test. It sounds like pregnancy but you just never know until it is confirmed.|`|QiPIsZ7Taa	you could just have PMS... was the sex unprotected? If it was when was it? also to eliminate the question/s go buy a pregnancy test walmart has them two in a box for like $6.00 that way you can take one today and one in the morning for better results... if negative.... wait about 5 more days for your period if nothing try testing again or go to the gyn.    I think if you are able to... that you should talk to your mother or another close adult that you trust about sex and birth control if it isn't too late... also if you are which I think you shouldn't having sex then you should always make sure that a condom is used! You don't want to be another teenage statistic.... there are more things to worry about other than just pregnancy... and 6 weeks... have you had a period at all in that 6 weeks? you should have if not go the the gyn to find out about pregnancy and contraception with your parent! sorry I am a mommy so you are like a baby to me.

72SrLDQ3aa	It will be fine to have them in the apartment. I doubt they will cause allergies, most children who grow up in a house with pets don't have animal allergies. If you do handle the hamsters, just wash your hands thoroughly afterwards before touching your baby.   And I think your husband should stop kissing the hamsters...|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Um.  I had Guinea pigs when my daughter was born.    If you handle them just wash your hands after wards.|`|f4zg7LHLaa	lol! we had one siberian hamster (called Ron) before my son was born, and we continued to play with him, clean him out etc when our son was born. we then got another one who happened to be female, and they mated, so then we had 11 babies plus the original 2! 10 of the babies died within hours, and one survived (Darwin, survival of the fittest)   then Darwin dies, we don't know why, then bear a week later, and then Ron!  i cried when Ron died because he was my favorite      well that was a bit off track, but my point is, as long as you was your hands well after handling them, there should be no problem. and keep the cages well cleaned as well.     RIP RON!!! :)

Z8Ui1ugLaa	No if there are that many kids, I think right now the 5 and 4 year old should have their room together.  Put a desk in there for homework time and when it is homework time, tell the 4 year old not to bother him.  Bunk beds for the older kids, but separate beds for the younger ones, or get them a bunk bed now and just keep them separate until they are a little older.|`|m2aznd8xaa	i do think that kids in school should have there own rooms and if you have to pair them up. pair them up age appropriate. the ones that are closer together in age can share rooms since they are pretty much into the same things. you could give the 5 year old his own room since he is in school. and put the 3 smaller ones together and just let your oldest one know that when the 4 year old starts school hes is gonna have to share his room. because thats the big boy room .|`|NjL6UlRwaa	i would let the 5 year old has his own room.
kiAQi91laa	You should first know if you're pregnant or not.  If you are pregnant then you should not have a combination of decidual bleeding and cramps.  If you are pregnant and are bleeding or spotting with bright blood you should IMMEDIATELY see a doctor despite having cramps or not.  In fact it is always best to have a doctor decided what is actually decidual bleeding because each patient is different.    If you're just having your period...then it's your period with cramps...
S9XfU79Jaa	Hey girl.  I'm in the same boat!!  I got my period on the 26th and first flow on the 27th.  I knew I was ovulating yesterday because I did a self cervix test.  And today my ovulation predictor monitor came back positive.. Well high actually not peak.  We ovulate late in our cycles.  Don't know why but it happens!!!!|`|8a97cd40085f30a1d504e99ab5132ba5aa	Hi. Depending on the length of your cycle, it's normal to ovulate that late. My cycle has been changed into 35 days for a few last months, and I am ovulating on day 20-21. So, it's perfectly well, since you normally ovulate 12-16 days BEFORE you next due period. Hope my answer helped. Best wishes.|`|AA11896942	I finally conceived when I ovulated on day 20 of my cycle.  You never know.  Hurry up and do the baby dance!    Good luck!|`|45c3IP4Aaa	Yes it is very normal. Not everyone ovulates on the 14th day. It all depends on your cycle and how long it is. So go for it and good Luck
txbZujeRaa	Mine does the exact same thing and I'm a zombie all day.  Mine is 6.5 mos old.  I thought for sure she'd be sleeping all night by now.  But like everyone says, all kids are different.  Recently for me, it has gotten a little bit better... well maybe once or twice a week it is.  The other nights she does the same thing yours does.  My latest strategy is to only go in there to feed her when her cry sounds desperate.  If it's just a mid level cry, I wait.  Last night that worked.  And after about 15 min of a medium cry, she went back to sleep on her own.  A few nights ago, it didn't work b/c her cry got really intense and she couldn't calm herself down, so I went in there and fed her.  I think you lucked out on your first kid.|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Since he is all of a sudden eating again then he is probably going through a growth spurt which is very normal.  Sorry, it should pass.|`|xue72D76aa	Sounds like he might be going through a growth spurt and so needs the extra nutrients.  He'll probably settle back down soon.  Try not to stress and roll with it.|`|BcjFssaEaa	do u think its hunger or comfort? pick him up calm him down n put him straight bk down keep doing it until he gets the picture does he have a dummy? if its comfort sucking get a doddy if he doesnt already n see if that helps  look up tracy hogg - baby whisperer she amazing  best of luck xxxxx|`|qHAgbuHkaa	Unfortunately there isn't much you can really do. There are a few things you can try, but some babies just aren't ready to sleep through the night. Every baby is different. What your daughter did has nothing to do with your son. When he wakes up for a feeding at night, don't get him right away. Wait 5 min and if he still is crying, then feed him. When you feed him, do not talk, do not turn on lights and do not make into play time. With my second son, he was still waking up 1 time a night when he was 6 months but he only woke up to feed (I breast fed) and I would pick him up, let him nurse and put him back in bed and he would go right back to sleep because we never turned on any lights or talked. That helps them know that its only time to eat, not time to get up and play. Since your son is bottle fed, try feeding him water instead of formula. He may begin to not want it and quit waking up for a feeding. Otherwise, you may just have to wait for him to outgrow the night feedings.|`|AA11327222	Some babies sleep and others don't is what my sons ped. tells us. My son just turned 2 in Nov and he still don't sleep all night. He will rarely sleep all night. Make sure ALL the lights are out even night lights and see if that helps.|`|5GntOFTnaa	Many babies do not sleep through the night at 5 months.  My daughter did not sleep through the night until she was a year old.  She is probably going through a growth spurt and requiring more calories.  You may try feeding her more frequently during the day.  It may help or it may not.  I sympathize with you, however sometimes it is best to accept defeat.|`|0a0hlTlUaa	my son is 10mnths old and he never slept through the night.I'm waiting for the fortunate day to come.But each child is different so if ur daughter slept through at 6 weeks doesn't mean that ur son will do the same.Babies also wake up often when they are teething.so may be that's the reason.
m2aznd8xaa	first you have to teach her what sound each letter makes once she experts that teach her how to sound out the words and put them together. but in order to learn to read you need to know and learn the sounds each letter makes.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	Perhaps you can make up games that involve clues in the form of a letter or two, where she either has to guess or choose between a few choices which answer the clue refers to.  Something like hide and seek, but with letter clues to the object, place or location of a little treat.  Making up picture choices for this game and also using either plastic letters or flash cards (file cards with one or more letters) are all you need for hours of this game.  But the motivation is better if finding out if she is right or not is not just you telling her that she is correct, but when she uses the letter to picture, to search for prize sequence.  Jelly Belly miniature jelly beans are about the right size to motivate without producing sugar overload, one or two at a time.       --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|FmSWPS7Paa	when i read books to my son. i use my finger to go along each word that i say. i think that this helps a little because my little guy catches on words and memorizes them.|`|aGLAt8tpaa	Most children learn to read by "sight reading" that is they learn whole words, all, or at least most, common words are learned this way. So she is learning the way nearly all children learn. It is only when they start reading a lot that they have to identify new words that are not already memorized.    My only suggestion is to get her to make the sound of each letter as she looks at the word then say the word (help her as English is a screwed up language and little of the pronunciation makes sense. )
lmESBQb7aa	No, there is othing to worry about at all, do not stress. It should cost around $300 to get it done. Go to your local clinic and ask them where you can have it done.|`|dPULl5hjaa	get a paternity test after the baby is born.  don't know how much the test would cost.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	You cannot test for a child's paternity before it is born. The only tests that can be done, e.g DNA tests, are done after birth. Anyone else that tells you otherwise is lying. You would need a sample of the baby's DNA and you cannot obtain that whilst they are in the womb without considerable risk to the baby. And anyway, you would need the mother's consent and I doubt that any woman, hussy or otherwise, would consent to such an invasive procedure.
hpy57bGAaa	Sometimes they occur a week or two weeks after unprotected sex  sometimes a month  sometimes not until later.  everyone is different|`|xpvFbcJqaa	never got em thank god..|`|lDKYC5leaa	Sometimes they don't, it all depends on the woman. Most women that do have nausea (morning sickness) have it during the first 3 months. I had none with my son.|`|AA10241127	as soon as a few weeks.|`|AE5iSWj0aa	I know I got nausea pretty quick..

DNygQdmVaa	yes thats normal.  theyll emerge soon enough.|`|3CVfUiiJaa	It is pretty normal.  My son's bottom teeth came in like this around 6 months...one slightly, and then the other one started.  I asked my doctor just recently because they don't like like they are all the way out yet, and his top ones are coming in.  He said it is normal and takes awhile for some teeth to come all the way out.    My son's top teeth are coming now at 8 months(one just cut through 2 days ago and the second one is starting to show a little now).  I think it is different for every baby and that there is no way to tell when they will come.|`|33h5R8nTaa	My daughter got her first tooth then a week later got the other 3 front teeth all at the same time. i think 2 cut one day and the other the next. This is totally normal. infact my daughters first tooth is half up and the one next to it is almost half up even tho it came in like 10 days later. Thats how they all come in, next u will see the top teeth.|`|8hYKIRWiaa	it is normal especially since he is already 10 months.  my son cut his bottom 2 teeth at 4 months at the same time.

Expliquez cela  vos parents...    Quel salaire pour l'assistante maternelle ?        La rmunration des assistantes maternelles est dfinie par la convention collective nationale des assistants maternels des particuliers employeurs, applicable depuis le 1er janvier 2005.      Selon la convention collective, chaque heure de travail est rmunre 2,26 , sur la base de 1/8 du salaire brut journalier.      titre dexemple, une journe de neuf heures de garde est paye 20,34 . Le salaire mensuel brut pour une anne  temps plein est fix de la manire suivante : salaire horaire brut x nombre dheures hebdomadaires x 52/12.    Ce mode de calcul permet de lisser la rmunration sur lanne. La dure conventionnelle de laccueil est fixe  une moyenne de 45 heures par semaine. Au-del, les heures sont payes et majores dun commun accord entre les parties.     Les indemnits d'entretien sont au minimum de 2,65  par journe d'accueil. S'y ajoutent les ventuels frais de repas ou de go?ter, si le parent employeur ne fournit pas son repas  l'enfant et les indemnits de dplacement lorsque la salarie transporte l'enfant dans son vhicule. L'ensemble de ces indemnits n'est pas soumis  cotisations.     Si lenfant a un handicap ou sil prsente momentanment des difficults de sant rclamant une attention accrue, une majoration pour "difficult particulire" est  ngocier.     Le paiement du salaire, effectu  date fixe, saccompagne de la remise du bulletin de paie (un modle de bulletin de paie est joint en annexe 6 de la convention) qui rcapitule les heures rellement effectues au cours du mois.|`|ec6b12966fea2b59222050b170b6b222aa	La valeur marchande du "TEMPS donn AUX AUTRES" n'a pas encore trouv son crneau complet, sauf pour le SOCIAL  cause du fort taux de ch?mage.

QGsYPJoKaa	It actually works the other way, that if you were naturally slim you show more than usual, because its more of an obvious change.    You could well be more, or if theres a hsitory of twins in your family then it could be that.    I would advise you go to see you doctor, because if you continue thinking ur two months pregnant then in 2 more months you give birth it will be a very big suprise, as it might turn out ur 6/7 months [ thought i don't think ur big enough for it to be that drastic lol].    But better to be safe than sorry !    Goodluck and all the best for the future :]|`|iwYu32N2aa	even if you are having twins, 2 months is still way to early to show, your just bloated, your baby bump will come in time don'tt rushh it. You said in your last question that that wanst you???|`|jNgh3e3Faa	No picture there.  I was huge with my daughter. She was my second baby and besides that, I ate a lot and gained way too much weight. (65 pounds)  It appears you are pushing it out. It does not look like baby to me at all.   Can you lay on your back and feel where your uterus is at yet?  I thought I could be having twins because they are somewhere in my family.|`|DNygQdmVaa	theres no pic.    could be either one.. or maybe your just bloated.|`|N1IqgXfvaa	By the end of your second month of pregnancy, your baby is about the size of a pinto bean and is approximately 14 to 20 mm long. If this is your first pregnancy, you still probably will not be showing yet. However, if this is not your first pregnancy you might be able to tell that you are pregnant. You will notice a slight change in how your clothes fit and your doctor can tell that your uterus is larger than normal. Before you were pregnant, your uterus was about the size of your fist. However, by 6 weeks of pregnancy, your uterus has grown to the size of a grapefruit!|`|8wnvhBQTaa	I have had twins and I didn't look this big at 2 months, you look about 5/6 months pregnant try getting an appointment for a scan ASAP.|`|SrXvJq8eaa	there is no picture...|`|1DA9gAP7aa	Talk to your GP or go for a scan|`|eH6hoKgEaa	at 2 months you shouldnt really have a bump yet. so either of your two options are possible.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	there is no pic. but what you could possible be either or both|`|xtieIDTyaa	If you are a naturally slim person of course you will show quite early on BUT not at 2 months ... Not even if you were having twins.    Edit = OMG just looked at the pic, Theres no way your 2 months! Lol, I think you must have your dates wrong.|`|4YfehneDaa	I couldn't see a picture using your link, but most likely you are bloated.  You wont start showing for a little while yet, even if you had twins. I didn't start showing until i was 5-6 months (singleton).|`|TYyWEzDyaa	Hi sweetie, I cant see the pictures but just wanted to give you my 2 cents. It could be possible that you are having twins if there is a history in your family. However, if I am honest I was feeling exactly the same as you. It was my first pregnancy and Im usually quite slim. I found that by 3 months i was quite big and i wasnt eating for two at all. I asked the midwife why i was getting so big already and she said every womans body is different.    The whole way through my pregnancy I was told I was having a big baby, however when i gave birth my baby was tiny and a little 6lb 2oz, not the 8lb baby i was told. My uterus had just stretched alot and i was carrying alot of amniotic fluid.     I hope this helps a bit honey, try not to worry too much about getting big. Its gonna happen no matter what but dont panic your uterus will shrink and you will get back to your old size.    Have a happy and healthy 9 months and I hope ur 12 wk scan goes great!|`|Q87djE0laa	oh yeah you do look about 5 month pregnant there just wait till your scan. do twins run in your family?

Chuck E Cheese is a good afternoon place to spend most the day if her actual birthday falls during the week it should not be so crazy and busy. She can take pictues of her daughter w/ Chuck E Cheese and of her playing.     If her daughter sits pretty well maybe take her to go paint pottery and do something with her hand print and footprint. That's a good memory. Take pictures there as well of her daughter playing with the paint.     Finish the day w/ a special dinner where the server can sing to her daughter and she can take pictures of that as well.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	They could take her to the zoo, aquarium, Chuckee Cheese, or any place they know she likes to go.|`|m2aznd8xaa	chucky cheeses throw great partys and the prices are great. they have packages to choose from and all kids who attend get tokens to play games. and chucky comes out to greet the kids . it a great place for a party. thet have kiddy rides that are great for 2 year olds.  good luck ive thrown many chucky cheese partys with my now 9 year ols and i now have a 20 month old we took her to chucky cheeses when she was one and she had a blast.and she got great pictures with chucky the mouse.

20fd8e3719790c14dd77e148b5e3dd41aa	tender tummies doesnt really happen so early on. i think that more than anything you're probably worrying yourself a bit too much and noticing all the frailties of your body alot more than you would if you hadnt been worried about pregnancy in the first place. also take note of what time in your cycle is the most likely time you could get pregnant.. usually the week right in between periods is the time you can get pregnant more easily.. so try to remember to use protection, otherwise be prepared for a little friend 9 and a half months later.    but yeah.. dont worry too much.. when i was pregnant, my stomach wasnt ever tender.. it was more hard than anything. it wont get sore i wouldnt think. til later. as for the cravings.. i think perhaps you might just really like the food. its not unusual for regular people to have cravings. but how you deal with them is an individual thing. as for the nervous feeling, i think its just you thinking that you might be pregnant, and what would happen if the blet pressed too hard on my stomache etc.. its not uncommon, but its too early to be concerned. in about 3 weeks, go have a test, if you are really concerned. and relax. babies arent a curse ;)|`|7ef176ec08c7ea634fd04b5d033608fcaa	I've been pregnant 4 times, and it sounds like it's probably the medication. You wouldn't normally be having any kind of food craving this early if you were pregnant. The tender belly fits....but you'd also have other symptoms....sore breasts, excess fatigue, increased hunger, nausea, irritability, being more forgetful....you may have one or all of these symptoms...but not just strictly a tender tummy. You might be....but from experience and what you say....I highly doubt that you are pregnant.

c71798825b466427b6554dbe635dfb81aa	I had the non-stress test weekly for the last 6 weeks of my pregnancy because of hypertension.  Basically, as long as the baby's heart rate is raised with each kick and then goes back to normal a few times, the baby "passes" the test.      You will most likely sit in a recliner and they will put two monitors on your belly: one to sense movement and one to record the baby's heart rate.  As the baby kicks, a black dot will appear on the printout and as the baby's heart rate goes up and down, that will be recorded, too.  They usually tested me for about 20 - 30 minutes and then would check to make sure the results looked good.  Then they would take my blood pressure and do a quick ultrasound just to check the fluid index.        I was concerned that my baby would be asleep or inactive when I went for a test, but there are measures they can take to "wake" the baby up.  First of all, if you eat something sweet before the test, the baby will likely react by becoming pretty active.  (I personally recommend Oreos!)  Otherwise, they will offer you some fruit juice during the test.  If those measures don't work, they can actually make a sound right next to your belly that will alert the baby and get him/her moving.      I was also worried because I had read that you have to record the kicks yourself by pushing a button every time you feel a kick.  This was not the case for me, and I doubt that most places rely on you to count the kicks anymore, because they have the technology to count the movements.  Furthermore, you will see that once they hook you up to the monitor, your baby is moving a lot more than you even realize.  I used to believe that my baby would go about 2 hours sometimes between periods of activity, but once I went for my first non-stress test, I realized that she was moving all the time!      Good luck!|`|H6VpmmgOaa	I am 36 weeks pregnant with my 3rd child.  I, too, have to have regularly scheduled non-stress tests because of my age (I'm 37).  I had my first one last week, and the baby was not cooperative!  She's usually active, but, of course, at test time she was asleep!  The nurses were great...they were able to put gentle pressure on my belly to get her to respond...they also used a small device on my belly which made a loud noise to stimulate her enough so that they could record movements (this little horn does NO damage to the baby).  I had to stay at the hospital until she had three "big" movements within 10 minutes.  It also diagnoses any contractions you may or may not be feeling.  The kick-count is a little easier.  Once the baby was "awakened", I just had to press the kick-count button each time I felt a movement.  So, don't worry.  If Baby is asleep, they should be able to get her moving for you!  Good luck & God Bless!|`|f10a2b24792102195bd28b9ebcc4747faa	I had non stress tests, however I had them done once or twice a week for the last couple of months of my pregnancy, simply because one isn't going to be right, therefore you need a couple to compare.  They were accurate for me.|`|dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	I had LOADS of non-stress tests in my last pregnancy. Advanced maternal age gets them running around like mad, let me tell you.    They hook you up to the monitors, put a fetal monitor on your belly and a blood pressure cuff on your arm. They'll have you relax for about 45 minutes, usually while laying on your left side, and monitor you and the baby.     If the baby isn't active they wake them up, trust me.  They have a device that they lay against your belly and it buzzes. The sound and the vibration wakes baby. My son was always asleep in the mornings because his schedule was to be awake for a few hours at night then take a big fat nap in the morning. That was normal for him.    They don't do just one test, they do several and compare them. The slightest bit of high blood pressure or dehydration can cause stress on the baby so they just want to check things out thoroughly. Chill out, take your meds and drink lots of water.     I went twice a week for the last few weeks of my pregnancy. They were the nicest people and were very happy to explain everything to me as they were doing it. They will report thier findings to your doctor, usually not to you. You lay down the whole time and might even fall asleep, I sure did.      As for counting kicks, it's hardly an exact science and has a wide margin for error. My doctor said not to do it because you can get it wrong then freak out and make a needless trip to the ER.     While you are hooked up and they monitor youe baby, you are supposed to relax. You have plenty of time to ask questions and see the print outs after they take the monitor off and the blood pressure cuff off of you. They might tell you your results, or they might make you wait to hear from your doctor.     If you or the baby are in distress or danger they will know right away and take care of things at that moment. Be prepared. I kept a packed bag in the car just in case they admitted me to the hospital. Pajamas, robe and toiletries for me,  and all the baby goodies in his own little bag in case I needed an emergency c-section.    He was fine, I'm fine, everything went very well!!|`|ca61402689139a586d12bf2b7cdcc48aaa	I had the stress test, 2 times a week starting at 30 weeks, up until i gave birth at 37 weeks :) They put you in this little cozy room in a nice chair lol, and hook you up to a machine, and when the baby moves they tell you to push this button, if the baby isnt moving much they will "zap" your tummy (doesnt hurt you or the baby) and this usually wakes the baby up, or they will give you juice to help. They usually hook you up for about 30 mins. And there was no outcome on my tests lol i just did them over and over and over and gave birth to my son, without being induced, who by the way had to stay in the nicu for 3 weeks because his lungs werent mature enough....So im not sure there really is a purpose to these tests lol.|`|AA11960734	I have had the stress test with my first.  I was overdue a week and they wanted to make sure everything was okay.  At first she was not responding that great when the test first started but I tried waking her up by shaking my belly a bit and that seemed to work, lol.  Just try to relax...don't let it worry you to much.  I'm sure your baby is fine.  They just take these precautions to make sure things are running smoothly.  I am assuming your in the third trimester and it's probably close to you delivering soon is why they are doing these tests.  Good luck to you and I'm sure you'll have a wonderful delivery!! :)

With my first pregnancy, I was 28 years old and it took 3 months.  With my second pregnancy, I was 30 and it happened the first try.    The healthier you are overall the better.  When trying to conceive, try to make sure you cut out alcohol, smoking, and drugs.  Take a prenatal vitamin, eat nutritious balanced meals, drink a good amount of water, get some exercise, etc.  A pre-pregnancy check-up with your ob/gyn can help you find out if there are any potential problems or issues.    Good luck!    mari|`|AA10488534	Yes, it is.  The cell wall (or equivalent) of the egg toughens as it ages, so it is harder for the sperm to penetrate.  Is it a lot harder?  After 30, no.

AA11497473	If what you're saying is, you continued taking your pills to avoid getting a period while on vacation, then you're more than likely not pregnant. You just threw your body off of it's regular schedule. If you're really worried get a P-test, but until you know otherwise, keep taking your pills like you're suppose to and your body should regulate itself.|`|Omj2CaObaa	go but a test i was on the pill when i got pregnant with my son and i didnt know i was untill i was 6wks pregnant but the way it sounds to me your not my bobs didnt get bigger till i was further along|`|7BbkogOUaa	take a pregnancy test! it will help u find wat u r looking 4. if u r, go to a doctor immediatly|`|X2nC8sfnaa	take a pregnancy test to check
dNWIVIBOaa	You will be adequately protected either way.  The normal convention is to start on a Sunday because the pills are dated that way.  It doesn't make a huge difference which day you start - as long as a.  you know and b.  you start the pills within 7 days of getting your period.  This will mean that you will be protected from getting pregnant.  If you wait longer than 7 days of your period, you will not be "guaranteed" protection.    As for the 1st of each month, you are now going to be on a 28 day regimen - meaning during days 21-28 you will have your period (well - it will start on 21 --- it may not last 7 days).  Your first of the month theory will go to pot - but you should be aware of when your period is due!|`|E5tQvMhJaa	You can start your pill on whichever day of the week you choose. Sundays are recommended just because it is easy to remember, but if you prefer to start on another day go for it.|`|IgoybtTtaa	Your body doesn't know whether it's Sunday, Wednesday, or Thursday.     Read the instructions - they usually have a 'Sunday start' section and a 'other-day start' section, but generally the directions are to start on the Sunday after your period began. So, that could be two days or six after.     It's totally okay.|`|KebBwKYDaa	You can start your pill on whichever day of the week you choose. Sundays are recommended just because it is easy to remember, but if you prefer to start on another day go for it.

Your optimum time to get pregnant is in the middle of your cycle, called the ovulation period.  Which is normally two weeks after your menstration period.  Wait until Sunday to start your pills as instructed, or you will be confused later in the month as to what day you are on and if you took your pills as scheduled or not.|`|ep702QMmaa	just start on the thursday after your period begins, the reason i like starting on a sunday is cause then i never have my period on a weekend!

Recuerda que an cuando no eyacule en t, durante la exitacin el pene despide secreciones que funcionan como lubricante natural, pero estas pueden llevar algunos espermas, por lo que se crea la posibilidad de un embarazo.

Al 11 da empiezan tus das fertiles que seran 5 das, durante esos das te recomiendo que tengas relaciones.

Contractions are extremely painful and you get a lot of pressure as well.

Kxwyy0Eaaa	Yes, some of the first foods are organic. It not only will say organic plainly on the label, but will also bear the USDA certified organic symbol. Also, Earth's Best baby food is exclusively organic. Giant Eagle grocery store has a house brand of organic baby food as well. Earth's Best has some varieties that Giant Eagle doesn't have so we buy those and the rest at Giant Eagle. However, our daughter is 16 months and we're trying to wean her from baby food, especially now that we found or blender which got misplaced in the move.     Earth's Best has coupons on their site, $1 off of ten jars, the same coupon is found on the baby cereal as well. (That was the only cereal we bought our daughter until she started to get "big girl"cereal-- Cheerios, store brand, Honey Nut Os, Kashi Honey Oats, some Annie's, the little things she can pick up with her fingers and easily dissolve in her mouth.) Also, Gerber has a thing on their site in which you can sign up for their mailing list and get coupons. I signed up after we moved (I think), but haven't received anything. (I think I signed up, I don't remember, but I'm still on the list for my in-laws' address.)     Now that my daughter is over a year, we're not as concerned about the foods being organic. However, we do make sure that her foods are whole and real.     I hope this has been of some help.    ETA: We would have started to  make her food sooner, but it really wasn't feasible. My husband was finishing grad school last spring and then we moved in with his parents. Their kitchen is barely functionable (yes, I know that's not really a word) for cooking for one adult. So, we got a bit behind with the big girl food. Eh. Things are better now at least and she is happy and healthy and that's the important thing.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I just bought organic fruits and fruits, stemmed them til soft and then mushed them up, add a little water or milk if it seems to think.  It really took little time or effort.  This was I knew exactly what I was putting into my child's body because it was prepared in my own kitchen.   Buy organic applesauce with no added sugars.  This is 10 times cheaper then buying individual ones.  Let bananas ripen and mash.  For other veggies, stem until soft.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	2ed foods are no diffrent from 1st foods just a lil thicker   just go for the single ingredient organic foods   ur baby will be fine|`|nOl8Uamkaa	They have some first foods that are organic.   http://www.gerber.com/Products/Organic_1...    http://www.gerber.com/Products/Organic_1...|`|d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	The Gerber plastic two packs are packed in  7 plastic (contains BPA) This is not a desirable packing method if you are the type of person who is concerned whether the food is organic or not.  Buy organic packed in glass containers or steam and mash your own if you have time.
9ozDCTDTaa	Take a deep breathe honey, you have a long road in front of you, but you can make it.  You want what is best for you child and believe it or not so do these people.  Like the first person said, they are not concerned about you and your emotional state, that think people can 'just get over it', but reality is very different.  You need to stay calm and cooperative with them, any hostility and they will view that as anger and a danger to your son.  You should look in to getting an attorney if you can afford one so someone is making sure these people are not taking advantage of you.  If you are still suffering from depression, you need to be VERY active in getting help with that.  And keep taking your son to the Dr so you have records that show that he is healthy and safe, they can't argue with those facts.  Just commit yourself to showing these people you are a good mom, they are going to ask you to jump through hoops, you aren't going to want to, they are going to seem ridiculous, and you are going to get sick of them, but keep telling yourself you are a good mom and you are doing this for your son.  You can vent to your husband when they leave, you can vent on here, just don't vent to them.  Hang in there!    Just an FYI: if the HV thought there was ANY threat at all to your son, by law she had to report it to social services, or she could have lost her job or even been arrested.  There are different jobs that require people to report ANY suspicion of child abuse to the proper authorities.  Those jobs include HV, daycare workers, teachers, nurses, doctors...|`|T4ddGudRaa	I agree with the others: get an attorney. Also, talk to the pediatrician and see if you can get his help in making your case. That said, you have given people reason to be concerned and they are just trying to do their job even if they are getting carried away. You need an attorney to be sure that you and your baby are not punished by the zeal of child services, but you should also be honest (and you should listen) about getting the help you need.|`|723QHuicaa	I feel awful for you.    This is the reason so many women - including myself - are absolutely terrified to admit the are struggling.    Like you, I could have won an pscar for my acting. Then it got to 10m post partum and I broke down. I was lucky, I went to a great dr, who treated me with fluoxetine (prozac). And I explained my fears about social services and talking to the HV. she said I was under no obligation to tell my HV but she recommended it.    I never. I took my pills and tried to make an effort to get out into new company. And slowly but surely - I got there.     In my opinion, if you answered that you didnt ''think'' you'd harm your child, thats a red flag right there. They cannot ignore that. I doubt she had it in for you. However, I think contacting social services right away was a bridge too far. I think regular home visits to check you, your baby, and your home life - would have been sufficient.    As for the weight issue, that is by no means a flag for child abuse - weight loss and malnutrition - yes, being above average weight, no.    Im sorry this is happening to you. I would make a formal complaint regarding the health visitor about how she handled the situation, as to see the records concerning you and you child. You CAN do this. Dont let them tell you that you cant. Also ask to see their protocal on how they handle possible ''at risk'' children. This is public information and will give you an idea on whether you were treated unfairly.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	This is so hard to answer and I really feel for you.   You have never harmed your son and I am assuming he is well cared for. I think it would be very premature and wrong for social services to take your child away based on conversations with your HV.  Are you still on medication for Postpartum? Have you recently seen your GP about the postpartum, ensured that the medication you are on is the right medication for you etc? If not, I would make an appointment with your GP.  Go back to your pediatrician and have him put in writing that he is not concerned about your son's weight. Where is your son on the growth charts? Discuss with the pediatrician how much you feed your son. Have him put in writing that you are not over-feeding your son.  Have social services spoken with your partner? If not, your partner needs to get in contact with them and tell them that he is not concerned for his son's safety. That although you have been emotional, you are capable of caring for your son.  Is there a family member that can stay with you during the day just for the next few weeks so that social services are happy that your son is not being left alone with you?  Have you explained to social services that your HV jumped to conclusions. That she perhaps, misinterpreted what you were saying. That you spoke with her when you were having a bad day (perhaps due to lack of sleep?). Perhaps explain that the HV has been very negative and critical towards you since day one and again stress, that you did not say anything regarding or indicating that you would be capable of hurting your son.  Get as much family support. Support from friends who will back you up. Have them speak with social services.   I am truly sorry for what you are going through. Be strong.  I hope everything works out for you.|`|AA11063878	First let me say that I am very sorry you are going through this..this shows how much the system can break down at certain times. 2nd..you need to realize and get it out of your head that these people have it in for you...they see a baby, and basically what they have to do is disregard you..because your an adult, they're concern is for a baby who cannot defend itself..and while you may not ever harm him..with all that happens in today's world..they really just can't take that chance.     okay, so what should you do? you need to get a lawyer, and you need him to get you a psychiatric evaluation..that has nothing to do with your current problem...they ...the psychiatric evaluation..needs to have it unbiased.     last..I am just a bit confused...whats and HV?|`|Ipq6Bvh3aa	It's sad, but you can't trust psychiatric professionals or social workers.  Their main ideological concern is enforcing social norms.  Also, they tend to be overworked, bitter, and judgmental.  Additionally, the people who are attracted to such professions tend to be very dogmatic in their beliefs.    You should find an attorney to fight these people.    Also, you should start taking yoga classes and try to do activities that you are passionate about.|`|wPi7fLLxaa	You need to pull yourself together as much as you can and realize that your son is the most important person in your life! The only thing you can do now is prove that you are a great mother and that you can take care of your child. Until they are convinced, you are going to have a long road ahead of you. Make sure the people around you know that you that you trusted them and thought that they were there to help not condemn you for being depressed. Remember that no one can know exactly what you are going through. Maybe seeing a psychologist would help.|`|f6aqMg97aa	We live day to day, we never know what to expect.  In your situation it is difficult.  Have you tried mom's groups?  Sometimes just getting out w/ other moms help, being able to talk to someone while the kids play.  It's good interation for the both of you.      You may want to talk to your doctor and let him know what is going on.  Perhaps he could write a note stating, you are not indangering your son, and his weight is not an issue.  Have everything documented.  It may or may not help.    When you were asked if you would hurt your son, and you responded. "I don't think so", that will raise questions in a Social Workers view.  That is considered "reportable" meaning once you said that they had to tell there bosses and it had to be investigated.  Whether you meant it or not.  Now you will have to show that your are a fit mother.  Which, if everything you are saying, is factual then it won't be difficult.  They may recommend you take a parenting class or get a Pscy Evaluation.      If they felt that you were a high risk threat, they would have removed your son immediately.      Currently, it sounds like they are trying to assist you and get you the right help.  Look online or in your local newspaper for playgroups.  If you can get a babysitter for a few hours, and take some mommy time to clear your head.  Things will get better.  You just have to find the right help.  It sounds like your on track but, you will feel hurt.  If you ever feel suicidal and you find yourself taking pills or trying to do something to your body that would harm you, call 911 immedieatly!!!  you are NOT alone.  You have to be around to watch your son grow and develope!      Good luck and things will start getting better!!!  You could also look into post partum depression groups.  You will find you are NOT alone and more people than you think can suffer from these feelings.  There are meds out there they won't work overnight but, give it time and talk to someone.  If you have insurance consider talking to a therapist or counselor.... Another option if you don't have insurance or the money is talk to a chaplain (Church), I'm not sure of your religious prefrence, if your not involved in a church you could find a non-denominational church and talk to the chaplain, and its FREEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!    Good LUck!!!    Hope this helps!
wiyQ3m9Vaa	After 3 yrs of marriage and trying to conceive all of that time. My husband and I sought advice from my OB/GYN who referred me to a fertility specialist I was actually hoping for explained infertility but oh well. After several failed inseminations, we tried IUI. Went through the IUI injections and the whole bit and mid-way through the cycle, I developed some kind of infection and my Dr canceled the cycle. It was devastating to say the least. We forged on and decided to change clinics to a very well known and successful consultant in India called India Med Guru Consultants recommended by a family friend of ours. Be very choosy when you find a doctor, I chose Indian Med Guru Consultants in India because there success rates are quite high. There are so many setbacks along the way, but working with Indian Med Guru Consultants made the process less stressful. We cried and thanked God for this wonderful blessing. By way of hope and encouragement, we got pregnant first time with IUI and ICSI and I'm now 6 months pregnant with a baby boy! I pray every night for people who are trying to conceive because I understand how awful it is. God bless you and know that He is with you through all of this.    http://www.indianmedguru.com  You can get much information in this website.
Kxwyy0Eaaa	That makes sense. He hasn't learned to really self-soothe yet, I don't think and he's comfy in Mommy's arms. My 16-month-old daughter still falls asleep for her nap and bedtime mostly by nursing herself to sleep. If we're out late in the evening, she'll fall asleep in the car. Also, my husband can get her to sleep in his arms. Just lately, she has started to spontaneously lay down when she is tired, which I think might be a good step to her going to sleep on her own. Also, I think she wakes up and night and goes back to sleep, too.This morning, before she got up, I heard her make noise as though she was awake. When I went to check on her, she was laying down. As I watched her sleep, she did wake up and look at me and smile. Also, last night she woke up and when I laid her down (for the third time), I just rubbed her back and she settled.     I believe in helping her learn to sleep on her own. I DO NOT believe in crying it out. I think it's mean and unfair. There might be times in a few years when she needs Mommy or Daddy at night and that's cool. My sister's daughter is five and still needs Mommy to curl up with her at times. It's understandable.     Besides, I'm going to take advantage of my daughter curling up in my arms and sleeping while she still wants to. It's going to go by way too quickly for my liking.|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	"Should" is not a very useful concept here. In my experience, those under 8 or 10 months who will happily go to sleep "on their own" are very much the exception.|`|9ozDCTDTaa	I may be the wrong person to answer this, seeing as how my daughter is 9 months old and still needs a little rocking time to fall a sleep, but what I have come to learn is there is no magic age.  My friend's baby has been doing it since 2 weeks old, my husband's cousin's baby not until he was a year.  I have tried EVERY trick in the book (except crying it out, won't do that) and none of it works.  I do what works for us.  I don't mind rocking her to sleep, it is more time that I get to spend with her and it only takes 5 minutes or so.|`|0a0hlTlUaa	I still rock my 10 mnth old son to sleep and i think that both of us enjoy it.I sing some songs while rocking him and after about 5 to 10 minutes he goes to sleep.Enjoy the quality time together.And there is no exact age when a baby will sleep on his own.Well if u really want him to sleep on his own then u can try cry it out method.|`|DIZKlxNraa	Some babies sleep through the night by themself right from the start, others don't till they are 2-3 years old. I guess my baby will be in the second group. My son is 8 months and only naps on my lap and wakes up every 2-3 hours every night and the only way to get him back to sleep is by nursing and/or rocking.   I read a lot about sleep training, some books and people advise to let the baby cry so she will learn how to fall asleep by herself. My baby can cry for hours and not sleep. For some babies it works though, but I wouldn't recomend it before 6 months.
IsozKRNeaa	My nephew did this with both of his parents, I think it's just a stage. I wouldn't worry too much, they get over it soon.|`|159e14ec854d24444172426d492de79eaa	well:julie you know "Toddler & Preschooler is very important thing  as Pregnancy & Parenting >says that both parents must stay together  and help each other every day plus talk to your own son also explain  to him it's best effort towards Family & Relationships should be stronger and happy forever|`|tQACzIljaa	I'm a dad, and my son went through this for a good little while. Was he breast fed? For some reason or another breast fed babies seem to have a lot closer attachment to the mother. My daughter was bottle fed and had no preference whatsoever. I think it is just a phase though. Best bet if at all possible is for you to give them one on one time without you around. My wife took a part time job and I had him while she was gone and now I seem to be his favorite :D|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I would be very worried about this. It goes against nature for a boy not to like his father unless there is a very good reason for it. I think your husband 'tries' to spend time with him to keep you happy but your son can tell he doesn't really want to be there so why would he want to be with him. I would set up a nanny cam and watch what really goes on when they are alone. This kind of thing worries me a lot...your husband must have done something quite bad for your son not to want to be with him. Please please investigate this for you son's and your husbands sake. If he isn't doing anything wrong then that can be ruled out and the focus can be on the son but check it out first. Some men are very manipulative and don't really like children at all and your husband might be saying one thing to you but doing another with your son.|`|Tk8x6WDhaa	Boys "love" their mom more at this age. My son was the same age when we went through this but every time my husband would say "Yes Daddy" and pick him and and spin him around or take him to the park or something fun and after a few days my son would say "yes Daddy" (meaning he wanted to play or have time with dad|`|Ybq7kznPaa	That would freak me out! Is there a reason he doesn't want to spend time with his dad? Is dad away alot? Or maybe its a stage and your next. I've heard of kids saying that about there mom or dad.

Wouldn't the oxygen go into their lungs? Adults lungs are larger than babies and if you blow into their mouth- their lungs will expand and they can't hold as much air as we can so you may damage their lungs. I was reading about infant cpr and you have to be careful when blowing in their mouth because of the difference in lung size.|`|73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	It works but I wouldn't do it too often. Too much of a risk of blowing something ( a piece of food stuck in a tooth for example) down into the child's lungs. Now and again if really necessary will be ok. It can also be used if the child sticks something up its nose that cant be easily removed.|`|iyL6dyMyaa	I read throughout from the time my child was born until he was a year old.  They said do not blow in a babies nose but I can't remember the reason.  When my son was about a month old, this girl asked me if she could do this, and I told her no, absolutely not.  I suggest using nasal drops, and the bulb syringe, holding him down, like I do my 20-month-old son, and go for it.
CtDBQwzaaa	I hate it too.. my mom said she was $50 dollars away from abortion with me... :(|`|JXXZIsBvaa	I guess to each his own.  I'm not for it but not against it.

You might never know the circumstance, for instance: rape or incest. Two very difficult things to deal with if a young Lady becomes pregnant regarding one of these instances. Something to definitely think about, but the choice is up to her.|`|kaZPtnhRaa	I think that abortion is stupid.  You are killing someone that could change your life and have a little fun with.  Unless you want to be a murderer to you own child don't get an abortion.|`|51HWwSlwaa	abortions are horrible in every way. i can understand that at times we get carried away and forget birth control. but a beautiful unborn child didn't do anything to be killed. To me it's simply murder!! If you are even thinking murdering a child, you are not mature enough to enjoy the love and happiness it could give you. Anyone who would kill a fetus which is a child GOD HAVE MERCY!!  There are so many, many couples that would love to adopt a precious baby, PLEASE, PLEASE think about adoption and not murder!!|`|cj7sSPZEaa	I believe that there are times when an abortion is the right choice, but I  hate to think that the majority of people who get an abortion are people who willingly had unprotected sex.  In my opinion, this is not an excuse to obtain an abortion.  I think that we need to focus more on educating people early on how to obtain birth control, and we need to encourage people to use two or more forms of contraceptives.  I think that people should be required to see a video of how an abortion is performed before they are allowed to get one and I think they shouldn't be allowed after the 8th week.|`|iwYu32N2aa	i hate that you are asking this question in this section.|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Im hate it too i think that if your gonna lay there to get pregnant you should deal with the consequences the baby didnt ask to be made..... now if there was a rape thats different ....|`|iuwLHT2Taa	Abortion is equal to murdering.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	I hate abortions too.

EmYNUZcXaa	it could be many things:    she may be hungry  may have to burp  wet or dirty diaper?  just not ready for bed...she's probably still on her own schedule  bored    have you tried to give her a nice warm bath after her last feeding? i give my 7 week old daughter a luke warm bath before bed if she can't sleep and i put Johnson & Johnson's "Bedtime Lotion" on her every single night. every since i started doing that she has been sleeping 6+ hours at night. its a life saver. they have the same stuff for bath wash cloths too and we use them for her nighttime baths. try singing to her too. babies like to hear familiar voices. whenever i'm talking on the phone my daughter usually falls asleep. its so cute :) also to help your baby out, when its daylight keep lights on and such and when its nighttime use calm voices and keep the tv and other noises down to a minimum. when you talk to your baby, talk in a calm and relaxing voice.    good luck to you. she will eventually get onto a schedule|`|c5519f0ed7a867f4c4afd56a3ecd58b1aa	Does she wake during the night to eat??

My period has gone weird on me in my life time more than once. The last time I had my period for a week, didn't have my period for a week and then had my period all over again. Asked my doctors as many questions as I could and they told me that somethings like that just happen.|`|iwYu32N2aa	slim,  if the tests came back neg and she bled twice in one month|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Well other than the fact both pregnancy tests came back negative, you can't get your period when you are pregnant, and if you bleed something is wrongggg. So none. =) Unless it is something called implantation bleeding, which happens about a week after the egg is fertilized. But it is much lighter than a regular period and only lasts 1 to 2 days. However, just because her period started a week earlier does not mean anything, and neither does having a second period. Sometimes irregular periods happen. Hope that helps.|`|rDhrDauRaa	um... the period would indicate that the tests were RIGHT, not WRONG... u dont get ur period when ur pregnant. and plus, TWO tests... shes not.

It is NOT trichotillomania which as suggested by the name is a mania, something uncontrollable that sufferers find almost impossible to manage and stop. Like a nervous twitch. Your child is under 5 and is doing it probably when sleepy or very relaxed. As we know feeling sleepy is rarely stressful. Put some olive oil on your child's head before bed, a mitten on the offending hand and stop worrying.    Edit = No, Do not smack her! She doesn't know shes doing anything wrong, Dont listen to all of these answers.. I doubt your child has a "Disease"|`|q8VRyCc0aa	Its just a phase.    I had a phase where i scratched my face (left a nice scar lol)    just put some mittens on her hands so she cant grip and pull :)|`|KjV0CDVRaa	She probally hasnt been using shampoo.

My mom says that means that the baby likes you. Also it means that the child will be very athletic..(which i do not believe) and it is very normal.

You might want to take her to the doctor.|`|NL34mhikaa	i knew a kid in first grade who pulled out his hair just because and he ended up being autistic... it may also just be something she does, like i sucked my fingers and my brother hugged the wall. literally, he was practically plastered to it!!   but i would try discipline; when she does it, smack her hands.|`|WVJxQ4ODaa	its probably just a little phase she's going through...  or maybe she's not getting enough attention..  you should spend like 24/7 watching what she does!|`|iZImidMRaa	well it could possibly be trichotillomania.  get her to the doctor's and find out if it's possibly that.  ask them specifically about TRiCHOTiLLOMANiA because it's a hair pulling disorder where one pulls the hair out from the scalp, eyes, brows, arms, pubes, legs, or any place they can find hair for the most part.  i pull from my scalp, eyes and brows and have pulled from my eyelashes since i was 8.  pulled out my eyebrows at about 11 but they grew back.  started pulling my hair at age 13 and began pulling my eyebrows at 15.  since your daughter is so young, you can catch it and possibly get it controlled if she does have trich.  trich is not a habit, its an impulse control disorder so be there for her as much as you can, especially if the doctor tells you that she does have it.  people with trich do this when they are bored, sleepy, reading, watching tv, upset, sad, depressed, stressed, angry, in school, or any other times.  but it all depends on when the person gets an urge or how they cope with things and choose to deal with it, etc.  try this site, www.dailystrength.org  its easy to use and they have a section for parents who's kid's have TRICH so you can read more up on it :).
PFO1jxZGaa	kids develop at different pace. If he is talking ( lilke you said two word phrases) I wouldnt be too concerned.

X6P1q8gmaa	you might get a better response in the grade-school section.  But ask the child what they want to do.  Making their own pizza can be fun.   If it's a girl party buy a bunch of make-up and nail polish form the dollar store and let them do make-overs.  If you have friends that are good at it have the adults show them the proper way to apply make-up.  Put on some music and let them hang out.  Let them go on a scavenger hunt looking for everyday items. or if they have cell phones with a camera or Digital camera they have to take their picture doing something fun, have a list of 10 things and a set amount of time to do it.|`|WSlxwSlFaa	You should not be on here so young.|`|AA10211580	rent them a karaoke machine so they can plug it into their tv. people of all ages love karaoke and it makes a good ice breaker.|`|AuvLNaaTaa	. . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\    You simply cant  anything that you give them they wont like|`|hamdnq5Yaa	I would do movies that they would like.

yCR6qg0baa	Yes! Exciting! I'm surprised you're ovulating so soon! =)  I have a friend who didn't ovulate until 8 months after she had hers out.    By the way, someone else answered with "a line is a line". That's true for pregnancy tests, not OPK's. An OPK is not positive until both lines are EQUAL darkness. I get two lines most of the month but the 2nd line is only darker when I ovulate. The directions say that, too. Yours is positive. You will ovulate 12-36 hours after you get a positive test.|`|ZXz9aavcaa	its a positive hunni|`|9eaQye5zaa	Congrats,  A line is a line,|`|ZHfvcyjXaa	Congrads!!|`|L6oSDA5Yaa	Yes it is a positive get the BD on all day!

DDYwnut6aa	No.  The reason they say not to use fmu for OPK's is because you're more likely to get a false negative.  Luteal hormone is typically synthesized later in the day, so you would be more likely to see your positive result then, if you're going to get one.   If you got a positive with fmu, you're surging!

AA11987492	I chose NOT to have my son circumcised. It is not medically necessary, and the very few UTI's that it prevents are negated by the rate of complications. People say that it is easier to clean, but that is NOT the case! With an natural penis, you just wipe like a finger, but with a circumcised one, you have to have gauze, Vaseline, push back skin to prevent adhesion's, and think about it... a fresh wound being soaked in urine and feces all day?!?!?!?!?!?!    The main reason you hear about boys needing to get circumcised at 3 or 4 is because of misinformation. Some old school doctors and nurses tell you that you have to forcibly retract the foreskin and clean under it every diaper change. not only is that not true, it is dangerous! At birth, and sometimes until puberty, the foreskin is attatched to the head of the penis like your fingernail is to your finger. It is NOT supposed to be retracted. It is like this in order to keep the head of the enis protected from urine and feces. Around the time a boy is potty trained, most boys are retractable. (you can pull the foreskin back) is this a coincidence? NO!!! There is no need to clean under the foreskin before it can be retracted because nothing can get under it. Do we need to clean under our fingernails? (the part that is actually attatched) no, because there is nothing to clean.      It is becoming less common is America (I don't know where you are?) So the locker room thing just wont hold up. Even if he does get made fun of for it, is it not our job as parents to build a healthy body image? If your daughter got made fun of for having small breast, would you immediately get her a breast augmentation? What are they making fun of anyway? At least he has a whole penis....    Looking like daddy, now this one makes me laugh! Ah, the ignorance of this statement! Since when do toddler boys look even remotely close to a grown man? What are you gonna tell him when he asks like he doesn't look like mommy or sissy??? And since when do teenagers compare penises with their father? This argument makes NO sense!!!    Your son can stay STD free with the use of a condom (which he should be using regardless of his circ status!) and still have his foreskin.    The foreskin is not just a useless flap of skin, it is a vital structure of the penis. http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/    If people are so worried about infections, HIV, and Cancer, the why why don't we give all baby girls routine mastectomies? That would eradicate breast cancer, which kills thousands every year, and is MUCH MUCH more common in the developed world than infections of the foreskin, penile cancer, and HIV put together!    The real kicker for me though, was the fact that I believe that we own our own bodies. Who am I to make that decision for my son. It is HIS penis, so it is HIS decision    http://www.naturalfamilyonline.com/5-bc/...    http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/    http://www.glorialemay.com/blog/?p=57    http://www.noharmm.org/mothering.htm    http://www.mothering.com/articles/new_ba...    http://childbirth.amuchbetterway.com/sev...    http://viewofcircumcision.blogspot.com/|`|epqMJAnCaa	Circumcision is a must, the extra skin will keep in dirt and always be there causing excessive sweating. Just for cleanliness only it should be done. Also, you don't want to be the boy in the locker room that all the other boys look at because you are different. My older brother was not circumcised and put up with a lot of crap from other guys in the locker room but also it affected his relationship with a girl that he thought they were getting serious.|`|b26Dp8LKaa	I am strongly against routine circumcision. It's amazing to me the myths & false or inaccurate information that continues to surround circumcision!     On a personal level, I have a son who is not circumcised. He has autism, is now a young adult & has NEVER had a single infection. I've never pulled back his foreskin to wash him. Not as an infant, not now. (That may be routine for a sexually active adult male.)    His dad is circumcised. We wondered about that as an issue. But really, the only difference a boy is likely to notice is that daddy's is bigger. DADDY is more likely to notice the difference.    Most people don't know that the primary reason circumcision became routine in the US around the late 1800's was as an attempt to prevent masturbation. (I didn't) Many reports say that the foreskin provides greater sensation/pleasure for men. Why would anyone want to take that away from our guys?    For those who say circumcision is for cleanliness or hygiene, you might want to do a little research. From a medical standpoint, that is untrue! There is a 1% increased risk of infection in the first year, which means you'd need to circumcise 100 penises to prevent a single UTI. Interestingly, there's about a 1% risk of complications when having the procedure. Perhaps the foreskin actually protects the head of the penis from infection.    For you gals who insist that circumcision is cleaner, consider having your labia removed. Because really, that would be more hygienic also! And we gals have more issues to deal with in that department every month! LOL Sounds kinda extreme, though, doesn't it?    From the American Academy of Pediatrics:  "there is little evidence to affirm the association between circumcision status and optimal penile hygiene"; "Intact men enjoy four times more penile sensitivity than circumcised men"; "less sexual dysfunction in circumcised adult men"    http://aappolicy.aappublications.org/cgi...    From the American Medical Association:  "data are not sufficient to recommend routine neonatal circumcision."  http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/category...    http://www.circumcision.org/  http://www.mothersagainstcirc.org/    Whatever you decide...it's YOUR choice!  I just hope people do their homework & make an informed decision. =D|`|7NsBWQZtaa	id say yes about the circumcision.. its more hygenic and i think looks alot better lol..|`|xQiWokYQaa	I just had my son Dec. 30th of '08. I was afraid that the circumcision would hurt him. In all truthfulness, I don't think it did. They took him from the room for about five minutes, then brought him right back. He never cried, didn't even really wake up for that matter. He had something called a plastibell around the area where the circumcision was, its just a little plastic ring. It came off after about 7 days. Just fell off in his diaper one day. There was no scabbing or redness. We just kept Neosporin smeared on the inside of his diaper so he wouldn't stick to his diaper while healing, and to help with any pain. We got the Neosporin with pain relief because I was afraid it would hurt him later while healing, but it never did.  I know circumcision is an optional thing, but we took into consideration that Daddy is circumcised, so we didn't want our son to wonder why "his didn't look like daddy's." Plus, its such a common thing, we also don't want him feeling self conscious about not looking like the rest of the guys in the locker room.|`|OWOtKZmgaa	no knife crazy doc is ever going to get near my foreskin or that of any child i have in future its a nasty practice with only disadvantages , loss of penile skin ,sensitivity ,comfort through life and terrible pain during and after the circumcision ,and of course the rights of the baby to have the body he was born with rather than a surgically altered one.remember almost no pain relief is given during this hostile genital assault as the patient is too small . respect the baby he owns his body .all the reasons in favour have been discredited and we all wash nowadays. locker rooms again and again what   goes on there that matters and has so much influence its just   sick and appalling get them shut down|`|jYPeis3Saa	my son is circ'd. healed very fast. no problems what-so-ever.    do what YOU want, not what crazy people on the internet tell you, you should do. it is your kid afterall, and YOUR decision|`|fiUF4cAXaa	I have 5 kids....4 boys and 1 girl.....when the baby is first born, his penis will be a little sore and they will give you bacitracin or something like that to put on his penis.

He could end up hating it and feeling mutilated like I do.  Circumcision is the amputation of the foreskin, not extra skin but an integral part of the penis; measuring 15 square inches in an adult and accounting for over half the penile skin, lots of specialised nerve endings and the most sensitive parts of the penis. The foreskin also has a unique elastic gliding action, allowing it to slide on itself and act like lube. This action is what most males use to masturbate with. Circumcised males use what skin they have left, except those who are cut so tightly that they have to use lube or just rub it dry. The intact male can stroke the entire length of his penis using his foreskin and also has the option to use lube too, if he wants to. During intercourse the foreskin acts like lube on entry and may act as a dam, preventing lubricating secretions escaping from the vagina. In one study women reported that sex with an intact partner was gentler and more satisfying since he doesn't have to thrust as hard to feel enough stimulation.  Not one major medical organisation in the world recommends routine infant circumcision anymore. The US is the last western nation still doing this to about 50% of its newborn males but even there rates are falling and many insurance companies no longer cover it, because it is deemed a waste of money. Sadly they often still don't use anaesthetic either and when they do its risky and ineffective. It's child abuse, pure and simple.  The penis forms as one organ and at birth the foreskin is usually fused to the glans like a fingernail to its finger. So there is no cavity for germs and dirt to collect in until it separates naturally later; sometimes not till puberty or later. Only the boy himself should retract it and then he can be taught to skin back and rinse with plain water regularly.  Misguided attempts to retract too early, often by doctors and nurses, are the main cause of damage to boys foreskins and the real main reason for childhood circumcisions.  To perform a neo-natal circumcision the circumciser has to rip the foreskin away from the glans with forceps. Then the foreskin is either cut away or clamped until it falls off. Both methods cause the baby extreme pain and his raw glans and wound sting every time he urinates. It's quite common for the raw edges of the cut foreskin to fuse to the raw glans during the healing process, forming skin bridges or tags. These complications and other more serious ones are often not found till puberty and do not show up in complication statistics.   More serious complications, though not common are immediate. Some babies lose their penis to infection, bleed profusely (often because they are haemophiliac) or even die each year.    The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of the male population is circumcised. Plus circumcised men have been found to have penile cancer, mostly on the scar. (Remember this is a very rare disease in intact or circumcised men).  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are, if anything, easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. A few intact males have problems with tight foreskin but this is only a tiny proportion of intact males. The condition can now be almost always treated with simple stretching exercises, sometimes in combination with a steroid cream that speeds up the process. However doctors who do not value the preservation of the foreskin often still trot out circumcision as a first-option treatment in the US and even some other countries.  I wish I'd been given the chance to choose for myself. Intact men can choose to get cut at any time in their life, though most have no desire to do so. The internet has shown that many men resent being circumcised. It's just not something that most of us talk about a lot, even to our parents.  Your son will grow up with many intact friends and there is every chance he will resent this unnecessary cosmetic surgery.  Geoff|`|AA11210211	I would say do it but that is me,my son and my hubby are both circumcised.There are many advantages and some disadvantages to it as there are with not doing it.|`|tQw6EDspaa	I had the same dilemma when I was pregnant but religious or not a baby is given what It is meant to have and I don't think it's right to tamper with it. It disgusts me when people cut their little baby's penis's off or puncture their beautiful ears.  There was a man in winnipeg who got circumcised and they accidentally cut his penis off! His parents tried to raise him as a girl and eventually he killed himself when he realized he was a boy. Now, you could take that chance or just leave him the way he is supposed to be. Why put him through the pain? there is NO reason.  Please don't do it, and don't let anyone convince you otherwise. It's your decision.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Unless your son has a medical problem with his foreskin (which will become obvious very quickly), it's unnecessary cosmetic surgery which is not routinely done in any developed country except the US.    Have him circumcised if he needs it. Not to make his penis look pretty.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well people might not like me for saying this but honestly if I had a boy I don't think I would get him circumcised for those who do that is totally fine. It doesn't matter to me and I don't think it is right or wrong the reason I wouldn't because at my hospital they require you to take the baby home and then bring the baby back when he is a few days old. I don't think I could take him home and have to go through that. I would definitely give it more thought before I made a final decision of course. They found out that it really is not hurting the baby to not be circumcised it doesn't get infected like they said if you wash properly which you would have to do anyways. They look ugly either way so it doesn't matter the look. I dated my ex whom was not circumcised and it didn't bother me. So that is just my choice! good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	i had my son done and deeply regret it- it's not needed or recommended- even the doctor who did it tried to get me not to but i was too dumb to listen. it really looked horrific after too- mutilated. my fiance and i agreed that if we shall have another son we will not do it.     i will say this as well. an intact baby boy does not and should not have his foreskin pulled back because it is fused much like a fingernail to the finger. so it's not hard to clean. with a cut little boy there is still extra skin that you DO have to full back and clean and pull it back to prevent adhesion     don't do sommething you might regret and can't fix in the future- he can have it done later if he wants to. 80% of men in the world are left intact about 50% in the US are now days|`|lGSUToFQaa	i had my son circumcised like my hubby, we did it for religious reasons and it's more sanitary, that's my opinion on it, good luck|`|EMKuBql8aa	Cathr169 said it perfectly.

They add that "it is not essential to the child's wellbeing."

I would HIGHLY recommend not getting it done. As with any surgical procedure, there's always a slight risk that something will go wrong. Better to not take the risk. If, later in life, your son decides he wants to get it done, he can. But that should be his decision.    There are some studies that suggest that circumcised men are slightly less likely to have certain health problems, but that's only because some uncircumcised men don't take proper care of themselves. You mention that the dad isn't around. So keep in mind that SOMEONE is going to have to instruct your son on proper hygiene. That's very important.|`|Yn2n26zXaa	While the negative physiological effects of circumcision have been documented, its harm to the psychological and spiritual health of the previously intact baby is immeasurable. Circumcision robs the male of as much as 80% or more of his penile skin. Depending on the foreskins length, cutting it off makes the penis as much as 25% or more shorter.    Careful anatomical investigation has shown that circumcision cuts off more than 3 ft. of veins, arteries, and capillaries, 240 ft. of nerves and more than 20,000 nerve endings. The foreskins muscles, glands, mucous membrane and epithelial tissues are destroyed as well.    Recent studies published in leading medical journals have reported that circumcision has long lasting effects on the developing brain. Until recently, the myth was promulgated that infants nervous systems were not adequately developed to feel the pain of circumcision. The truth, with regard to the perception of pain, is that the nervous system of an infant is fully developed by the third trimester.     Developmental neuropsychologist doctor James Prescot suggests that circumcision can cause deeper and more disturbing levels of neurological damage as well. the foreskin has three known functions.: protective, sensory, and sexual. More recently, medical doctors have admitted that infants do feel pain, and local anesthesia is often used now prior to circumcision. While this reduces certain responses to pain during the procedure, it does not eliminate them, and it introduces another painful procedure, the injection of the anesthesia.    The effects of the local anesthesia wear off in a matter of hours. The pain experienced in the subsequent hours, days, and weeks is not affected by this anesthesia. This pain interferes with mother/infant bonding and breastfeeding.    The foreskin protects the glans throughout life. It serves a sexual function because it is a highly innovated tissue and affects the size, shape and lubrication of the erect penis. It keeps the glans penis moist and soft, adding in foreplay, insertion and intercourse.         Dry or painful sex is the most common sexual complaint of women in the U.S..According to a study published in the New Zealand Medical Journal, Nine out of ten women prefer sex with intact men.      As a mother, a doula and an human rights activist, I beg you...leave your son. This procedure is cruel and abusive and robs the child of his rights to be whole. If you have any doubt watch a circumcision, there are plenty of them on the web.    Leave your son to make this decision when he is older. It is not your place to decide.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I wouldn't do it if I had a son because I've researched it a lot because I think it's cruel and unnecessary. The benefits people say are just "potential benefits" and most of them don't apply to kids anyway, only adults. Also, the foreskin does keep the glans sensitive so an intact penis has more sensation for the guy. There are a lot of risks and some of them are quite serious for an unnecessary procedure. Also they rarely use pain relief and if they do it's not adequate. I think it's a horrible first life experience. It's very rare here in Australia now (used to be routine) so most guys in the last 30 years haven't been circumcised, and there is not an epidemic of foreskin problems. They're pretty rare and usually only come with very bad hygiene. So I would advise you not to get your son circumcised. Good luck!    Harriet|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	All I have to add is that I'm against it. My husband feels like he was mutilated as a newborn and that his mother should have protected him from such a thing. It affects a man's sexuality in ways we woman could not comprehend, your son should decide such as issue for himself when he's old enough.   PS How come is such a terrible thing to do this to a girl and we routinely do it to newborn baby boys. If you haven't been convinced yet watch a circumcision video and see if you could actually put your son through something like that.|`|TA3Bit1kaa	read the AAP's article on it - they're impartial... They say its not recommended|`|G4qP2gATaa	I'm due the end of Feb. and I'm not getting him circumcised.    It's really a personal decision since circumcision isn't necessary. Just do research on the pros and cons of it =)|`|AA11348933	Here is some information for you.    http://www.mothering.com/discussions/sho...|`|7jrqIIRHaa	It is cleaner and safer for your child with the extra fold they are more likely to get yeast infection an more susceptible to stds|`|xBMaUchtaa	Its up to you. But my opinion is to get boys circumsized. There are cons to having your boy uncircumsized as they are more prone to infection. But wish you luck with the rest of your pregnancy and enjoy your baby boy.|`|AA12243380	I think you need to research and make your own decision.    I would prefer not to circumcise my son but my husband is VERY strongly in favor of it and so it will happen because he is so positive that it has to be done.    Good luck to you!  If it were my choice only, I wouldn't do it.  The AAP doesn't think it's necessary to circ every boy.
3CVfUiiJaa	My son didn't roll until he was 6 months.  He started going from back to front, and couldn't figure out how to get back...we were forever getting up in the middle of the night to roll him back on his back when he would fuss and cry.  Around 7 months he finally learned how to get from tummy to back...and now at 8 months I can't keep him still...he rolls all over the place.  Don't worry, your son will roll when he is ready to, just keep trying tummy time and he will get it eventually.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes- average is 4-6 months he sounds just fine|`|X6as2nOAaa	he is fine he will get it don't worry.|`|jYPeis3Saa	my son didnt roll over until he was 8 months old. on fathers day actually.    now at 15 months he is running all over the house getting into everything.      i wouldnt worry. each baby develops at their own rate
ZXz9aavcaa	hello hunni its hard to get a faulse positive but you may still be pregnant some people still have a period even when they are pregnant people can go through the pregnancy and keep getting them or you may have had a misscariage please go and see youre gp or go to a walk in center you will feel much better when you no what is going on hun best of luck to you x|`|OItPJZjBaa	You need to go to the doctor, but yes you can still get your period while being pregnant.|`|9eaQye5zaa	It's very hard to get a false positive, meaning if the test found the hormone then you are pregnant, or you could have been pregnant and had a very early miscarriage which was the period you had. Test again, good luck.
fG7LmB7Kaa	Either she was still a virgin or she started her period.|`|AFIYLZzpaa	maybe she never popped her hymen?|`|ZHfvcyjXaa	Too rough im guessing.If it hurts then you shouldnt be doing it..Seems young|`|8YltlMsjaa	she may have started her period, or has never had her cherry" popped yet...|`|jLLkSWyiaa	she could have gotten her period or you popped her cherry|`|3WFac9xaaa	If you dont know some reasonable explanations for this maybe your too young to be having sex in the first place??
Q0DLGuGwaa	if you had positives then negatives it may have been a chemical pregnancy especially if the same test yesterday came back very strong, did you use the tests at the same time for example all in the mornings or some in the evenings this can change a test, or maybe the tests are very faint do you have pictures of all the tests that may help us determine, i used a HCG test and i thought it was negative i threw it away and waited two more days and the next test was even stronger then the control line, i looked at the old test again and found that actually there was a faint positive i just hadn't looked close enough, now im 12 weeks 4 days pregnant, good luck baby dust too u|`|i8Ch743Laa	I would say yes,pregnant. Tests very rarely give false positives,unless you are on a fertility drug containing the pregnancy hormone,have a "chemical" pregnancy,or the test is defective. With as many as you've taken,it's most definitely not a defective test. Good luck!|`|SKJb6eLKaa	You could be pregnant.    Go to your doctor. Get a blood test. Get prenatals!    You may have suffered an early miscarriage..Maybe you should try fertility treatments or see if there is something wrong if it has been 4 years?|`|vuEyUbsgaa	Yeah.Duh|`|wFe7L1XJaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!!|`|vSHkZWUoaa	yes and have more unprotected sex during pregnancy|`|MtOSX19Haa	You can get a false negative (saying your not when you really are), but with the hormone the tests test for you can't get a false positive (saying your pregnant when your not).  If you got a positive on any of the tests, you are pregnant.  No matter how faint the line.  I have used all kinds of tests, the cheap ones and the expensive.  They all test for the same hormone.  Good luck and congrats.|`|7jrqIIRHaa	yes your prego|`|rSCeB6T6aa	I had a couple "faint positive" reponses with the +/- tests.  I then switched to a kind that just says, pregnant or not pregnant.  It confirmed my faint positive tests.  I would spend the money on one of those to be sure before you go to the doctor.|`|jLLkSWyiaa	hell yea you are ...|`|9eaQye5zaa	You are definitely pregnant. A line is still a line, no matter how faint, the hormone is there. Congratulations!|`|x3vnPezTaa	i would say you are pregnant but just to be sure go in and have a blood test done. I mean if the majority said positive then that most likely means you are. like i said though get a blood test done just to be sure. Hope this helps and i hope a congrats is in order! Good luck hun!|`|jk6ayFUmaa	if you had so many positives  i would say yes you are
jLLkSWyiaa	wow thats just evil ... poke a hole in em ... lmao|`|shPIoenzaa	Wow, you are a total dumbass.|`|dJnRFpWWaa	Sure. That thinking might prevail right up until your child is born and the other guy demands a paternity test and the test proves he isn't the father. Then who do you think your ex-girlfriend will sue for child support?     Grow up. Don't be a loser like the two of them.|`|JFkcIdHxaa	What an extremely rude way to get back at your girlfriend. Do you understand that giving birth to a child means that she is responsible for that child for the first 18 years of its life. It also means that you have a large chance of having to pay child support, and if you want to do that, go ahead.|`|c8tyG5z3aa	There are so many other ways to get back at her.  You're an idiot for even thinking up this sort of plan, getting her pregnant for 9 months and having her experience the wonders of being a mother is a way to get back at someone? Yeah, great plan, genius.    And, ever hear of a fraternity test? Probably not, because you're an idiot. She can easily order you to take one to see if you are the father of her child, just as well as the other guy. Then you'll have to end up paying child support ordered by the court.    Just don't do it. It's a stupid plan, and YOUR child is the one that will be suffering, not her.    All of this is probably a joke anyhow. Just look at the other questions you've asked. Apparently you've already got a son.|`|Bmcjz0UKaa	lol um, and then say she wants to get you tested...what happens then?|`|9eaQye5zaa	I'm sorry but this has to be a joke. It's very stupid. DNA my friend, it will prove who is the real father in the end. Plus the little fact that you are playing with a life here. Just leave her if she's a cheater.|`|ZB524v05aa	Really? you don't think the other guy is going to ask for a paternity test? Ever hear of friend of court? That is who collects child support and they will get a court order making you get a paternity test, which YOU will have to pay for? Supporting a kid for the next 18 years is a long way to go for revenge.|`|BkVMXkgSaa	instead of saying wrong i would say unhealthy, instead of this try other ways of revenge  i totally understand cause i would probably kill you sense of humour is really dark, but what if you do the same as she did, make your friend to date her, let him take her to some cosy place and she will find you there with another in bed, but she will be with another too...   or think of more cruel or clever plan,but not pregnant, i can imagine but if you love her e.g. then im reallly sorry, the best thing is to say it loud to her.  oh it sounds like a movie i wish to know its end...|`|UNLrYNeUaa	well she maybe still be having sex with the other guy and if she gets pregnant you won't know if the baby is be yours and if that happens then what? are you gonna still stay with her if the baby's not yours? there's no way you'll be able to prove it if don't take a dna test. think about your actions before you do|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Hmm wasn't this question posted earlier but some of the wording changed up?!? in any event you are as I said earlier a self righteous moron for even coming up with this idea. She may think the child is the otr guy's but in the end it will be yours so what sense does this plan make, suppose she tests the otr guy & it comes back negative then her attention turns to you, use your thinking cap strups|`|wA7kqXfRaa	you can poke a hole in it probably. ur avatar looks like a gurl. r u?|`|09061e5674207e8f8a877ca8a18d54f5aa	Wow dude are you really serious! Its gonna be funny when she does end up pregnant and she leaves you for the other guy.....just a stupid question!!!|`|g9ZFjl6paa	troll! u have a girls picture and ur asking stupid ?'s! troll!!    *get a life*|`|ud8jzRdNaa	what makes you think they would think its the other guys baby? for a start if you do get her pregnant on the 1st try wouldn't the dates be out and why would you want your child be be brought up by a woman you obviously hate i think this is the wrong kind or revenge the only person you'd hurt in the end is the child and possibly yourself try something else to get Your revenge if you must and for got to mention if she never agree not to use a condom with you (her boyfriend) the chances are shed defiantly use on with a guy she cheating with|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	You posted this the other night. Clearly your intelligence has not gone up. You still do not understand what a DNA TEST is.  Please contact Maury Povich  and he can explain it to you. You might even end up appearing on his show.     If this woman is sleeping with you and this guy why do you think she wouldnt  get a dna test to confirm who the father is or that this other guy would not want a dna test to confirm if he was the father.  When this backfires in your face and your stuck paying child support for at least 18 years you will have no one to blame but yourself.|`|jk6ayFUmaa	and if she uses a condom with the other guy she will want to do a dna test then you are a father|`|3WFac9xaaa	Hey chicka.  Maybe shes already pregnant with the other guys baby =]  And you wont have to worry about it.|`|x3vnPezTaa	Seriously your an absolute moron! Why in the hell would you even want to get your g/f knocked up if she cheated on you. I mean i know you are using it as revenge but on the same hand... maybe that guy is a better guy all around and would be better off raising your kid to begin with. You really need to grow up! I hope you never have the chance to bring a child into this world. You obviously dont know anything about taking care of a kid!

z0tn4PoAaa	Babies all have different sleep patterns, and you shouldn't expect to get her on any kind of schedule at her young age.
