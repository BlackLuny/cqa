Você nunca ficará bilionário trabalhando de carteira assinada para os outros. Embora possa ter que trabalhar para acumular experiência e o capital inicial.<br>  2. Você terá que desenvolver um espírito empreendedor. Pratique no seu dia a dia identificar necessidades das pessoas n?o atendidas pelo mercado e inicie um negócio ou negócios com esse diferencial. No seu primeiro negócio, compre uma pequena empresa para aprender a gerenciar. é mais fácil corrigir erros do que fazer tudo funcionar do início. Depois que tiver tarimbado, coloque alguém para gerenciar e abra outros negócios. <br>  3. Escolha e desenvolva pessoas para que trabalhem para e com você. Você nunca será um bilionário sozinho. Precisará da ajuda de muita gente e deverá recompensá-las adequadamente por isso.<br>  <br>  Mais de 70% dos bilionários come?aram do nada.

N?o tem nada a perder. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Prosperidade e Auto Ajuda, baseada em números perfeitos. <br>  <br>  Se você for uma pessoa decidida, leia até o final. Com certeza vai ficar feliz por ter recebido este e-mail. Entretanto, se for cético e pessimista, n?o perca tempo, n?o leia, pois este assunto nada tem a haver com você. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bem, se você está lendo esta linha é porque quer continuar a ler. OK! Vamos lá! <br>  <br>  : Meu nome é Leonardo moura e sou um pequeno empresário. Em Junho de 2002, recebi pelo correio eletr?nico uma informa??o inusitada. é claro, ela veio espontaneamente. Simplesmente pegaram meu nome/e-mail em algum cadastro de mala direta ou de algum provedor. Gra?as a Deus por isto! Depois de ter lido a informa??o por várias vezes, mal pude acreditar no que meus olhos tinham visto. Diante de mim estava uma estupenda maneira de resolver todos os meus problemas. Eu n?o teria que investir quase nada,e mais, sem me endividar novamente. Logo peguei um papel e caneta e comecei a fazer alguns cálculos. <br>  <br>  : Conclui que o que iria fazer era um investimento baixíssimo e, no mínimo, ainda assim, teria minha aplica??o de volta. Pensei: Por que n?o? Pior do que eu estava n?o poderia ficar". Segui as instru??es correta e minuciosamente. Enviei, inicialmente, 250 e-mails, dinheiro come?ou a chegar. Vagarosamente no início, mas após algumas semanas eu estava recebendo mais e-mails do que poderia ter em um dia. Passados três meses, mais ou menos, o dinheiro parou de chegar. Como tinha feito um registro preciso do dinheiro recebido, fiquei estarrecido. O final totalizava R$ 598.494,00 (Quinhentos e noventa e oito mil, quatrocentos e noventa e quatro reais) <br>  <br>  : Fantástico!!! Paguei todas as minhas dívidas, comprei um carro novo, uma bela casa e enviei de forma intercalada (quatro vezes de 250) mais 1.000 cartas/e-mails. Em quatro meses, aproximadamente, recebi R$ 2.694.218,00 (Dois milh?es, seiscentos e noventa e quatro mil, duzentos e dezoito reais). <br>  <br>  : Leia atentamente este programa. Ele pode mudar sua vida para sempre. <br>  <br>  : Lembre-se: este programa n?o funciona, se n?o for colocado em prática de forma correta e como indicado nas instru??es adiante. <br>  <br>  : Esta é uma grande oportunidade, com pouquíssimo custo ou risco. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  INSTRU??ES <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Siga exatamente as simples instru??es abaixo, e em três meses aproximadamente você receberá mais de R$ 300.000,00 (Trezentos mil reais). <br>  <br>  : <br>  <br>              GARANTIDO MESMO <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N.. (1). Imediatamente, mande R$ 2,00 (dois reais) para cada uma as seis pessoas que est?o relacionadas na listagem adiante. Da seguinte forma: deposite esta quantia na conta-corrente ou poupan?a delas e n?o se aborre?a caso tenha que ir a várias agências bancárias. <br>  <br>  : (Há uma lei divina que exige algum sacrifício (imola??o) ou trabalho cansativo arduo para se obter os resultados desejados.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (2). Quando depositar os R$ 2,00 (dois reais) na conta-corrente ou poupan?a das seis pessoas da lista, você precisa mandar um e-mail para cada uma delas dizendo:                                                  O número do comprovante do depósito bancário e <br>  <br>  : "Solicito que meu nome/e-mail seja incluído no seu cadastro de correspondências". Esta é a chave do programa! Torna legalizada a opera??o bancária e fica de acordo com a legisla??o vigente. A legisla??o diz que todo dinheiro recebido deve ser trocado por um produto ou servi?o. Este é o servi?o! (Posteriormente, as pessoas que fizerem depósitos em sua conta far?o o mesmo.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (3}. Após ter depositado os R$ 2,00 (dois reais) para cada uma das seis pessoas, digite uma nova lista. Em seguida tire o nome que está no número 1 (um) e mude os nomes restantes para uma posi??o cima (o segundo nome passa para o n° 1, o terceiro para o n° 2 e assim por diante, até que o sexto nome assuma a posi??o no 5 e o seu nome passa ent?o a ser o no 6). <br>  <br>  : Em nenhuma hipótese mude a seqüência de nomes. N?o coloque seu nome em uma posi??o diferente, pois n?o funciona. Seu nome deverá estar no n° 6. (Caso você mude a seqüência de nomes, isso denotará egoísmo e contraria os princípios básicos da solidariedade e fraternidade estabelecidos por lei divina - como você verá à frente.) <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (4). Pegue 250 nomes/e-mails em alguma empresa que forne?a mala direta. O jornal Folha de S?o Paulo, O Globo e outros, por exemplo, têm em suas páginas de classificados anúncios oferecendo listagens a baixo pre?o ou se preferir mande 250 mensagens para salas de discuss?es,newsgroups,rede de bbs,fórum,mural,e outros formas de postagem na net.<br>  Obs:para achar fórum,mural,sala de discuss?es e outros procure em sites de busca. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (5). Completada a etapa anterior (n° 4), insira os nomes/e-mails coletados nos arquivos de seu programa de E-Mails - outlook ou outro - e envie com esse mesmo texto. Você deverá salvar sua lista no formato TXT ou Rich Text Format, porque muitas pessoas n?o têm um processador de texto moderno - nos formatos sugeridos a carta/e-mail abre em qualquer computador. é bom enviar aos poucos. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (6). Siga estrita e exatamente as instru??es deste programa e dentro de aproximadamente 90 dias você irá receber, garantido, mais de R$ 300.000,00 (Trezentos mil reais) COMO FUNCIONA O PROGRAMA, Digamos que você tenha, por exemplo, um retorno de 3% dos e-mails enviados, o que é uma estimativa bastante conservadora. Em minhas duas tentativas tive mais do que 3% de retorno. 1. Quando você manda 250 e-mails com carta, cerca de 7 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (7). Essas 7 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 52 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. . 3. Essas 52 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 390 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. 4. Essas 390 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca e 2.925 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. 5. Essas 2.925 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 21.937 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. . <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  N. (8). Essas 21.937 pessoas enviam 250 e-mails, cerca de 164.527 pessoas lhe mandam R$ 2,00. E segue assim, numa progress?o geométrica. Em algum ponto seu nome sairá da lista, dando oportunidade para outras pessoas. <br>  <br>  : Mas, você recebeu aproximadamente R$ 379.676,00 (como aconteceu no meu caso).Isso funciona sempre <br>  <br>  No exemplo acima, você terá enviado 250 cartas/e-mails.Se você enviar 1.000 cartas/e-mails, pode chegar a receber R$ 1.518.704,00 - que foi o que recebi. Fantástico, n?o é verdade? <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Se você quiser, fa?a alguns cálculos por si mesmo. Com esse tipo de retorno, mesmo com a crise em que estamos vivendo, você poderá alcan?ar 40% desses valores - o que significa 1% de retorno - o que já pode mudar sua vida. Veja que, 40% de R$ 1.518.704,00 s?o R$ 607.481,60. Participe e n?o se arrependerá <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Acredite... tenha fé! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Por fim, o programa só funciona se você depositar R$ 2,00 (dois reais) na conta-corrente de cada uma das seis pessoas adiante relacionadas, e enviar - a todas elas - um e-mail solicitando a inclus?o de seu nome/e-mail na lista de correspondências delas e dizendo o No do Comprovante do Depósito. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Lembre-se que milhares de pessoas far?o o mesmo com rela??o a você. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EIS A RELA??O DAS PESSOAS PARA AS QUAIS VOCê FARá O DEPóSITO BANCáRIO - R$ 2,00 (DOIS REAIS)PARA OS BRASILEIROS OU 2 (EUROS) AOS EUROPEUS OU 2 (DóLARES) AOS ESTRANGEIROS DE OUTROS PAíSES <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  : 01-W.M.P..<br>  <br>     BANCO BRADESCO  AGENCIA 1448-6 POUPAN?A 515 806-0<br>  <br>     wpenafiel@hotmail.com <br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  02-N.NAIRE..<br>      BANCO real     AGENCIA     0145    POUPAN?A 18 566 730-8 Brasil<br>       Bidica42@yahoo.com.br<br>   <br>  <br>     <br>  <br>      <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  03-MP<br>           <br>           BANCO REAL   AGENCIA 0190     POUPAN?A   19 324 757-1       Brasil<br>      <br>           msp740@yahoo.com.br<br>      <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  04- MCA<br>  <br>          BANCO ITAú      AGENCIA    6180      C/C 07359-2  Brasil     <br>         <br>             marlyzinha2005@yahoo.com.br<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  05-UD<br>  <br>         BANCO BRADESCO   AGENCIA    2798-7   POUPAN?A 1005316-1  Brasil<br>  <br>          udias7@hotmail.com    <br>  <br>  06-LEO<br>  <br>         BANCO DO BRASIL  AGENCIA     1044-8     C/C 11306-9  Brasil<br>  <br>            nbmpm@ig.com.br       <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Obs.: Imprima essa lista. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  IMPORTANTE: Repare que todos os nomes que constam da lista n?o est?o completos. Esse anonimato é proposital. Tem a finalidade de preservar as pessoas e, ao mesmo tempo, cumprir um ritual de várias tradi??es espirituais: "Fazer o bem sem olhar a quem". Fa?a o mesmo com seu nome. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>                 OBSERVA??ES: <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1. N?o envie essa mensagem como anexo, pois algumas pessoas evitam abrir com medo que contenha vírus. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Siga exatamente as instru??es contidas nesta carta/e-mail. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. N?o mude, em nenhuma hipótese, a seqüência dos nomes da listagem. A única exce??o, evidentemente, é excluir o que estiver em primeiro lugar e incluir seu nome na sexta posi??o da lista. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4. N?o esque?a de enviar um e-mail para cada uma das pessoas da listagem, solicitando que elas incluam seu nome/e-mail "na lista de correspondências" delas. Isso caracteriza um servi?o e dá respaldo legal aos depósitos bancários. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Como a importancia de R$ 2,00 (dois reais) é, na verdade, uma quantia irrisória, fa?a imediatamente os depósitos na conta dos nomes da listagem. Isso faz com que a circula??o monetária permane?a ativa e n?o haja nenhuma interrup??o dos fluxos financeiros. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ESTE PROGRAMA E 100% LEGAL, POIS ESTá FAZENDO DEPóSITO DE LIVRE E DE ESPONTANEA VONTADE, PARA AJUDAR A UMA PESSOA IDENTIFICADA E BENEFICIADA.

AA12204387	Veja a reportagem do link:<br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicasResp.aspx?dica_Id=9017" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a><br>  <br>  Seu nome foi incluído no SPC e n?o sabe o que fazer?<br>  <br>  <br>  Seu or?amento tem andado apertado, e você perdeu completamente o controle da sua situa??o financeira. Você também sabe que, em mais de uma ocasi?o, as pessoas ou empresas, que receberam um cheque sem fundo seu amea?aram protestar o seu nome. Mas, passado algum tempo, você deixou até mesmo de se preocupar com esse tipo de amea?a.<br>  <br>  é preciso reverter esse quadro o mais rápido possível. E para isso, a primeira providência a tomar é a de se conscientizar de que existe um problema, e que se você n?o fizer nada para resolvê-lo ninguém mais fará. Mesmo nos casos em que a emiss?o do cheque sem fundo, ou o atraso no pagamento da presta??o, foram fatos isolados, é bastante provável que seu nome tenha sido incluído no cadastro de inadimplentes.<br>  <br>  Nessas horas a primeira coisa a fazer é manter a calma: você n?o está sozinho! Segundo dados do último relatório do Banco Central sobre Opera??es de Crédito, pouco mais de 14% dos financiamentos concedidos para pessoa física est?o com algum tipo de atraso, sendo que em metade dos casos o atraso supera 90 dias.<br>  <br>  Seu nome está mesmo no cadastro?<br>  Em seguida procure confirmar essa informa??o. De nada adianta se esconder atrás do problema, ele existe e você precisa enfrentá-lo, mais cedo ou mais tarde ele virá à tona, e você precisa estar preparado para as conseqüências.<br>  <br>  Como era de se esperar, os cadastros do SPC (Servi?o de Prote??o ao Crédito) e do Serasa n?o podem ser disponibilizados por telefone, internet, o mesmo vale para pendências financeiras. Se de um lado isso dificulta a confirma??o da sua inclus?o, de outro garante um pouco de prote??o aos consumidores cujos nomes foram incluídos no cadastro.<br>  <br>  Caso receba contato por e-mail de que seu nome foi incluído no cadastro do Serasa ou SPC ignore: é bastante provável que se trate de algum fraudador tentando obter informa??es pessoais suas (como senha de banco, RG, CPF) para benefício próprio. Em outros casos trata-se de vírus, que acaba corrompendo o computador, e lhe causando muito prejuízo.<br>  <br>  Os dados do Serasa só est?o disponíveis para as empresas associadas. Mas, o CDC lhe garante o direito a esta informa??o, para tanto basta se dirigir a uma das agências do Serasa.<br>  <br>  Como tirar o seu nome do cadastro?<br>  Ainda que seja reconfortante saber que você n?o está sozinho, é importante que você se mobilize para retirar o seu nome do cadastro de inadimplentes o mais rápido possível. Abaixo listamos o que é preciso fazer para limpar o seu nome e retirá-lo do cadastro de inadimplentes dos órg?os de prote??o ao crédito: <br>  Pagamento da dívida<br>  Pois é, se a sua inclus?o no cadastro reflete apenas uma situa??o temporária, o melhor é tentar obter recursos para pagar a dívida pendente. Venda algum objeto de valor que tenha, corte gastos no seu or?amento, ou em última instancia pe?a para algum familiar.<br>  <br>  Ao pagar a dívida seu nome deve ser imediatamente excluído dos cadastros de inadimplência. Mais precisamente, o CDC (Código de Defesa do Consumidor) estabelece o prazo máximo de 5 dias úteis a contar da quita??o para que a empresa, para que seu nome seja excluído do cadastro.<br>  <br>  Se esse prazo n?o for respeitado, você deve entrar em contato com o órg?o e pedir esclarecimentos. Vale notar, contudo, que a renegocia??o n?o garante automaticamente a exclus?o do cadastro, de forma que é preciso negociar isto com o credor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prescri??o do prazo de validade do título<br>  A inadimplência muitas vezes é causada pelo atraso no pagamento dos valores previstos em um título, esse é o caso, por exemplo, dos cheques, das duplicatas e notas promissórias.<br>  <br>  Caso o pagamento n?o seja efetuado o nome de quem emitiu o título pode ser protestado, mas isso só pode acontecer durante o prazo de validade dos mesmos. Para quem n?o sabe vale lembrar que o Código Civil prevê que uma vez passado o prazo de prescri??o do título n?o pode ser mais cobrado, e como tal, a dívida deixa de existir e com ela a inadimplência.<br>  <br>  Da mesma forma que nos casos de quita??o, nos casos em que a dívida é prescrita, você precisa procurar a institui??o ou empresa para quem está devendo, e pedir para que comuniquem ao Serasa o vencimento da dívida. Feito isso, a institui??o deve enviar pedido ao Serasa para que dê baixa do seu nome do cadastro.<br>  <br>  <br>  Disputa judicial<br>  Um número cada vez maior de consumidores tem optado por questionar na Justi?a os termos da dívida que eventualmente os levou a uma situa??o de inadimplência. Esse tipo de situa??o já é comum, sobretudo, nos financiamentos imobiliários, mas já existem casos em que o consumidor questiona a evolu??o do saldo devedor do seu cart?o de crédito e até mesmo do cheque especial.<br>  <br>  Ainda que n?o haja consenso, várias decis?es do STJ alegam que a inclus?o do nome do consumidor no cadastro de inadimplência enquanto a dívida estiver sendo discutida na Justi?a equivale a uma forma de amea?a e constrangimento. Nesses casos, portanto, mesmo n?o tendo arcado com o pagamento, o consumidor consegue impedir a inclus?o do seu nome no cadastro de inadimplência.<br>  <br>  Para quem se encontra nessa situa??o, a primeira providência a ser tomada para ter seu nome retirado do cadastro é se certificar de que o processo já foi julgado em juízo e que se encontra arquivado ou extinto. Para tanto, pe?a uma cópia do despacho do juiz ou da certid?o emitida pela Vara Cível onde o processo foi distribuído. Envie essa documenta??o ao Serasa e pe?a a exclus?o do seu nome do cadastro.<br>  <br>  <br>  Automaticamente após 5 anos<br>  Pois, é. Mesmo que você n?o pague aquilo que deve, depois de passados 5 anos da inclus?o do seu nome no cadastro de inadimplentes ele deve ser automaticamente retirado.<br>  Como regularizo minha situa??o?<br>  Dentre as op??es discutidas acima, provavelmente, a mais rápida é a quita??o da dívida, mas mesmo nesse caso é preciso adotar alguns procedimentos para efetivamente regularizar a sua situa??o. Abaixo detalhamos o que deve ser feito em cada um dos casos em que é possível pedir a exclus?o do cadastro de inadimplentes: <br>  Cheque sem fundo no CCF<br>  Esse tipo de situa??o acontece quando o cheque que você emitiu é devolvido depois de ter sido apresentado duas vezes. O primeiro passo deve ser procurar a agência em que você tem conta, e solicitar todas as informa??es (número do cheque, valor e data) referentes ao cheque que foi protestado. Descubra para quem foi emitido o cheque, de forma que você possa recuperá-lo e regularizar o débito.<br>  <br>  Com o cheque em m?os, fa?a uma carta para o banco, pe?a orienta??o ao gerente do banco onde tem conta, junte o original do cheque recuperado e pague as taxas envolvidas neste processo. Protocole uma cópia dos documentos entregues para regulariza??o no Banco Central.<br>  <br>  Caso queira se certificar de que o banco em quest?o irá comunicar a regulariza??o da situa??o ao Banco do Brasil, que é responsável pela atualiza??o do Cadastro de Emitentes de Cheques Sem Fundo (CCF) pe?a um protocolo de comunica??o. Vale lembrar que a regulariza??o de cheque sem fundo só ocorre quando o Banco do Brasil enviar comando específico ao Serasa.<br>  <br>  <br>  Título protestado<br>  A situa??o do título protestado é a mesma do cheque sem fundo, ou seja, você só pode pagar o que deve se souber para quem e o quanto deve. A única diferen?a é que você deve ir primeiro ao cartório aonde o título foi protestado para levantar a documenta??o.<br>  <br>  Uma vez que você tenha pagado o que devia, você deve exigir da pessoa, ou empresa, para quem estava devendo uma carta reconhecendo a quita??o da dívida. Feito isso, reconhe?a a firma desta carta e retorne ao cartório e solicite o cancelamento do protesto. Uma vez cancelado o protesto pe?a para que seja emitida uma nova certid?o e entregue a mesma ao Serasa para que seja dada baixa no seu nome do cadastro.<br>  <br>  Em geral o ideal, sobretudo, nos casos de crediário e financiamento junto a um banco é que antes de atrasar o pagamento da presta??o o consumidor tente entrar em algum tipo de acordo de forma a evitar a inadimplência. Muitas vezes a empresa se recusa a negociar e o bem acaba sendo tomado, mas em alguns casos as partes chegam a um acordo. Em geral o prazo de regulariza??o varia entre 2 e 5 dias após a comunica??o do acordo à Associa??o Comercial na qual a empresa com a qual levantou crediário é associada.<br>  A inclus?o no cadastro de inadimplentes deve servir como um alerta de que está na hora de você rever seus hábitos enquanto consumidor. De nada adianta tanto esfor?o para regularizar a sua situa??o, se, daqui a alguns meses, você voltar a agir de forma irresponsável com o seu dinheiro.<br>  <br>  Reveja seus hábitos de consumo e passe a agir de acordo com suas posses. Reflita sobre o que pretende comprar, se há realmente necessidade. Pense bem antes de comprar. Se n?o puder comprar a vista, talvez valha a pena poupar um pouco mais ao invés de comprar a prazo. <br>  <br>  <br>  Vou ter dar uns links para você se informar mais : <br>  <br>  Várias Dicas sobre Dívidas <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicas.aspx?***_Id=27" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Dicas sobre Empréstimos e financiamentos: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicas.aspx?***_Id=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Dicas sobre Defenda-se: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicas.aspx?***_Id=25" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Dicas sobre consumidor: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicas.aspx?***_Id=19" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Defini??es sobre consumidor: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes/def_Perguntas.aspx?***_Id=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Dicas sobre finana?as pessoais: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dicas.aspx?***_Id=9" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/dicas/dica...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Defini??es sobre Leis: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes/def_Perguntas.aspx?***_Id=11" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Defini??es sobre Justi?a: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes/def_Perguntas.aspx?***_Id=14" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes...</a> <br>  <br>  Várias Defini??es Constitui??o federal: <br>  <a href="http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes/def_Perguntas.aspx?***_Id=12" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br/aprende/definicoes...</a> <br>  <br>  Espero ter ajudado . <br>  Site de referências financeiras e finan?as pessoais: <a href="http://www.igf.com.br" rel="nofollow">http://www.igf.com.br</a>|`|AA12005596	SPC é negativa??o do comércio em geral.

A partir de la tercera venta, las ganancias comenzarán a ser para tí.<br>  <br>  Los mismo sucederá contigo.

Como sabrás en los multiniveles primero debes vender mínimo a siete personas para empezar a recibir tus comisiones, o mejor dicho, lo que queda de ellas, pues debes repartirlas entre la empresa, y todos los que estan arriba de tí.  Además si las personas a quienes les vendes, no venden, pues tu te quedas sin recibir ni un centavo y así el producto sea bueno, no tienes cómo disfrutarlo.  En estos sistemas sólo salen ganando las personas que inician la pirámide, pues reciben los beneficios de todas las que estan abajo, y se vuelve como un reclutamiento humano en beneficio de los primeros.<br>  <br>  Coastal Vacations tiene un excelente plan de marketing, que le permite a la persona depender SOLAMENTE de su trabajo y dedicación, pues la venta es directa, es decir NO hay intermediarios. Cada uno de sus miembros es distribuidor de un completísimo paquete vacacional (27 vacaciones, 6 cruceros, 17 tarjetas de membresia para obtener dctos. en hoteles, resorts, condominios,... del mundo entero. ), obteniendo así una comisión por venta de U$ 1000.  Y no es para que te las arregles como puedas, ya que también incluye un fabuloso sistema para trabajar por Internet con WEBS, empleados virtuales,banners, .... en fín.  <br>  En mi caso personal invertí U$ 1395 (U$ 1295 del paquete y U$ 100 del sistema para trabajar), y en mes y medio he conseguido tres ventas (U$ 3000 de utilidad), eso sí con dedicación y trabajo, pues sé que todo depende de mí y de nadie más; además sé que voy a llegar más lejos, pues apenas estoy empezando a aprovechar esta fabulosa herramienta que es Internet.  Además no es caro, pues el valor de uno solo de los cruceros supera el valor total del paquete.<br>  Si deseas corroborar la honestidad de Coastal Vacations, o de cualquier otra empresa, coloca el nombre en cualquier buscador, a donde, como sabrás,  llega toda la información buena y mala que halla en la red, pues las empresas no tienen control sobre eso, y verás los resultados.  Esto, y un completo cambio de información con mi director, quien es la persona que me ha guiado en éste camino de satisfacciones, fue lo que me ayudó a decidirme por Coastal, y no me arrepiento.  Hay tanto que quisiera contarte, pero el espacio es muy poco; si te interesa visítame www.ganarmas.net/amanda, sin ningún compromiso.  Chao!<br>  <br>  Hola de Nuevo, deseo explicarte algo sobre lo que dice el compa?ero que esta abajo.  El principal plan de marketing de Coastal, dice que las dos primeras ventas son del director con el que entraste, en recompensa de su guía al ayudarte a cerrarlas.  Tu empezarías a recibir toda tu comisión desde la tercera; pero hay una forma de ver resultados desde la primera venta, obteniendo así tu Licencia de Director Internacional.  Además el apoyo de tu director lo tienes siempre.  Visítame y  te cuento sobre cómo ingresar con el Paquete de Nivel I con entrenamiento....|`|8660ee15028298de136a0ee64cd5d5bbaa	NO entiendo bien la respuesta de Patolin, en el primer parrafo dice que los ingresos de tu trabajo se los quedan los que estan arriba del todo de la piramide, sin embargo en el segundo parrafo dices que gracias a esta franquicia estas ganando bastante, no lo entiendo es un buen negocio para ti o para los que estan por encima tuya, yo todo esto lo sigo viendo muy confuso.<br>  Ya habia hecho lo que dices de poner coastal... en el google y desde luego que no encuentro criticas pero es que todo lo que hay es de los que trabajais ahi y si tanta gente ahí que me garantiza que yo obtenga resultados??<br>  Además no veo lógico que sin estudios ni nada se pueda uno meter a trabajar en algo como esto.

i5MiFhMyaa	If I'd get such a letter I'd be concerned about identity theft. How would such a bozo (a complete stranger identifying himself as Steve Davidson) find out and know about my financial situation and whether I need a loan.     Also there is no way on earth that someone would send a complete stranger a check for any significant amount of money, without some pretty serious conditions or obligations involved.    These crooks are trying to extract money from innocent people by coming up with this bull-s??? story of "happiest person in the whole wild world". They are no different from the Nigerian scam artists that send you an email announcing that you won a quintzillion dollars in a lottery you never entered.    Check if the "email" address on such a letter is a free account (yahoo, hotmail, etc). Postal address is always a P.O. box. This is usually a telltale sign that a crook is operating.    In this case you can see that this turd is in fact using a "freebie" untraceable email account - stevedavidsonloanenquiries@yahoo.com. THE FREE EMAIL ADDRESS IS ALWAYS A BIG RED FLAG.    Why would a legitimate business use a freebie account?

MmTe8W8uaa	First, it could be a scam.    Second, even if they are telling the truth, it is illegal to put information about any debt from 2001, other than an unpaid tax lien, on a credit report now, UNLESS you agree to pay it or have done something else since 2001.  With the exceptions of bankruptcies and unpaid tax liens, only things that came due or went delinquent within the last 7 to 7.5 years are allowed on credit reports.    Third, if you agree to pay some or all, then you (again) owe the money that you agree to pay and it CAN then go on your credit report.|`|ReQyHq4Baa	I hope you haven't given them your social security number and current bank account number.  I googled them and they are, plain as day, on Rip-Off report for unauthorized debits to people's accounts.  If you are sure you didn't leave the account in the negative, it's a scam!  The warning signs in your head probably went up when they discouraged you from calling your bank and your warning signs are right!    Scam!   I'd even tell them, hey I did some research on you guys, don't ever call my home again.  If they have your account number tell them that if you notice unauthorized debits, you will report them to your bank, the proper authorities and close your account.

If you make the most, you will be first - and they go off your credit.  But it will enable you to get your home.  As long as you stay current on the mortgage, you could refinance in 6 months.  If you choose to do this, make sure you have a no pre-payment - - - - If you have a pre-payment, it would cost you 2-5 percent of the loan amount to get out of the mortgage.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.  you could get approved for a 90 percent loan.  Try to find a seller who is willing to hold a seller 2nd (for the 10 percent).  This will get you into your home, based on you alone.  The seller 2nd could be forgiven at close, or you can refinance in 6 months - 12 months, with a no pre-payment, and you could pay off the 2nd.<br>  <br>  Talk with a broker, a broker underwrites for many company's (I underwrite for 150 companies) so I only have to pull credit 1 time, and they look at my credit. A single lender (not a broker) has programs available, but they may not be able to help you and your situation, so you go elsewhere, and than that person pulls your credit (see what I mean.) If you shop, your credit is pulled and that is considered a soft pull, for a 30 day period. Just like shopping for a auto, it is good for 30 days.  If you apply for a credit card, that is considered a "hard" pull and it drags down your credit score.   When looking for a home, please do not apply for a credit card, Department Charge Card, Gasoline Card or make any major purchases, like a auto, etc.  This will pull your credit down. <br>  <br>  <br>  Try to find someone (broker) that will pull your credit one time, and submit your loan application to company's that will go off his credit report. By the way, a loan application is called a 1003, and they will issue you a GFE (Good Faith estimate, with-in 3 days, that is per the RESPA laws, and the TIL (Truth in Lending). The GFE  will tell you the up-front closing cost associated with your loan.  The TIL will tell you the terms, rate associated with your loan.

NwkZ5OmCaa	Maybe yes, maybe no.    If you *still* paid $600 or more in tax even after the baby is on your return, you'll probably see  the $300 more.    However, if your taxes drop below $300, you won't since your total for 2008 would be $600 and you already got it last  year.    The tax return that CLAIMS the baby is the one that *might* get the $300.  Only one of you can claim the baby.

blC1U6LFaa	Call the FTC's opt out hotline 1 888 567-8688.  This allows you to opt out from receiving pre approvals for credit cards.  I've heard the credit repositories look positively at this, and can increase your score 1-30 points.    Another fast way to increase your score is to lower your balance to limit ratios on your revolving accounts (credit cards).  If you don't have the money to pay them down, call and see if the account holder will increase your limit.  Increasing your limit, or lowering your balance will both decrease your balance to limit ratio.    Those are some quick things you can do off the top of my head.|`|iufAPDeWaa	Thats the only way to get credit is pay off your debts timely and consistently. If you don't havea car, credit card, or something else you're paying off then you will just not have credit. Not good or bad just none. Because thats how it is when you're young and starting off with no credit. One good thing to do is take out a loan for like 500 dollars or whatever, then put the money in savings (do not spend!!) and just pay it back monthly. The same exact money. Because once you pay off a debt thats when you get good points on your credit score.

blC1U6LFaa	Technically, if you want to save the most money, closing sooner, on the lower interest rate will save you the most in the long run.  Unless you have an FHA loan, the interest will accrue daily on your current mortgage until you pay it off.  If you're looking to save money close sooner.    It's all personal preference.  Closing near the end of the month will give you lower closing costs, because you won't have a lot of per diem interest accruing, but you will have a higher payoff amount by the end of the month.

So, there was no seriousness about joining or staying in a company. Some of these graduates were very choosy because there were many jobs available. So, they took jobs for granted. <br>  <br>  I would suggest two things. My suggestion to them now is, choose a company that wants you and not the company you want. And, stay there. This is no time to jump around and experiment.<br>  If you have a stable start in the beginning of your career, even if it is for a lower salary, it is okay. You should forego the idea that you would not work in Tier 2 cities, and that you would not work in lesser known companies. <br>  You should look for job content that can add value to your experience. Only those who are doing well in the company will be kept in troubled times. Those who are not adding value will be under threat. <br>  <br>  So, you choose a company where you can learn and contribute. When you are contributing, you are under less threat.|`|cQq9vTTraa	teacher!
2opG5Qaoaa	When your nature of share transaction is with the profit motive, then all your transactions will be treated as "Trading".  That is business income.<br>  <br>  1. Actually buying and selling on the same day will be treated as Speculation.  But you can show it as business income.<br>  <br>  2. F & O are trading <br>  <br>  3. Taking delivery in your case will be treated as Trading.  If you buy and sell once in a way and if your turnover is very less, then you can show it as short term capital gains.  In my opinion, this is nothing but Trading income in your case.<br>  <br>  If your investment in this activity is not much and if your turnover is not very high and your income is not much then you can just forget it.  I know many persons in my town trading like you.  They never bother about filing returns for their shares activity.<br>  <br>  If you want to include this shares trading activity in your Income Tax returns, then you need to consult a Income tax consultant as you have to file ITR-4 return which is about 20 pages.|`|va8quhPtaa	A business involving considerable risk to get large gains can be called speculation.Involving in share business is nothing but speculation.

Bw1h5xAcaa	Normally I am a very tolerant person when it comes to pot. But how careless does someone have to be to get caught using it while in nursing school? Was he using it on school grounds? During classtime? Did he come to clinicals high? <br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but if he can't leave the sh*t at home then he has a problem with it, and I don't want a person with a drug problem becoming MY nurse. He needs to clean up his act before he even thinks about trying to get back into school. <br>  <br>  And yes, he will have problems getting accepted. His transcripts will follow him everywhere he goes. He will have some long, hard explaining to do to be able to get accepted anywhere, and the best advice I can give is he should go through some kind of treatment program so he has physical evidence that he is changing his life and is responsible enough to become a professionally licensed nurse.|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	possibly. cause when he applies to the new school they will have to review his transcript. i dont know if they put information like that on students transcript
3K1QW7Oeaa	When are you going to realize that what you are looking for is UNREALISTIC?|`|PxoKseAiaa	Look anywhere in the San Gabriel Valley if you want to stay near Pasadena. There are some areas there that may be a bit more affordable rent wise.<br>  <br>  Also, as I advised previously, check CraigsList.  Look for a map of the Pasadena area, and look for rental houses in the cities surrounding it.  San Gabriel, South Pasadena, Alhambra come to mind.|`|lzEuuseJaa	Even in areas surrounding Pasadena, it's going to be hard to find a safe neighborhood at that price. San Gabriel and Alhambra are not that much less than Pasadena in OK areas, and South Pasadena is way more $$. Burbank, Glendale, Monrovia, Monterey Park will be similar to Pasadena and other cities like Arcadia, San Marino, La Canada will be more.<br>  <br>  To give you an idea, I own a home in Highland Park (Los Angeles) that I rent out for $1500 a month. Highland Park is sorta dangerous (gangs), but this is an OK neighborhood of HP as it's on the Pasadena border. Only a little dangerous, but bad schools. The home is about 1000 sq ft, 2 br / 1 ba. Lots of the small older homes are like that around LA, this house was actually 750 sq ft before an addition, a lot of the neighbors' homes are still about 750 sq ft. I've had the same tenant for about 10 years and her rent is low compared to other nearby rentals, because she's a good tenant and it covers the expenses, since I bought the house a zillion years ago.<br>  <br>  For $1000 - $1400 a month today you would probably find a one bedroom / 1 bath older apt (not fancy) in an OK area in Pasadena, about $1500 - $1800 for a 2bd/1 or 2ba, more $$ if newer or in a nicer area. <br>  <br>  That's about the minimum you can pay anywhere in LA that's somewhat safe.

Those are a scam.  I have been a mystery shopper and I have been mystery shopped at a job.  First, it's not easy money, the check lists I have seen have been very long and you must describe every aspect in great detail.  Once it was all said and done it wasn't worth it to me.  Also, since I had been on the other end, I knew how bad things could be if someone wasn't paying attention as a mystery shopper.
136657af2324e74f90df26698dbd6645aa	Most of them are scams designed to make people think they can make money the easy way but they cost you more money than you end up making.  There are some that work, but you usually end up putting more effort into them to make them work than you would put in at a good job.  Find a job that you can enjoy for some reason and stick with it.

Without knowing everything on your return, it is impossible to find teh exact reason|`|2QQfM2weaa	I can answer your question from a US tax perspective. Some of my income comes from a company that deducts money from my earnings each pay period to pay taxes. However, I am also self employed as a private contractor for music festivals and my income does not receive deductions for taxes. Therefore, when I file my taxes if I were to only look at my return from the company, it would be huge because taxes have already been taken out and there is an overpayment because I do not claim myself or any dependents in my withholding. However, when I add in earnings from self employment, this figure goes way down because I have paid no taxes on these earnings because no money is withheld.

E1ztfbg8aa	<a href="http://goodsurveysites.com" rel="nofollow">http://goodsurveysites.com</a> Its what I do and it's worked out pretty well. What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER.<br>  <br>  The sites don't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  They don’t need any information other than your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of these websites, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $8600 by working in my spare time.

Do you mean you have the money to purchase the property, and then you want someone to manage the property you bought?<br>  <br>  If so, then realistically it would depend on, what type of property you are purchasing.  If you have more than 3 or 4 units, in the building, then it may be worth it.<br>  <br>  If you have less than 3 or 4 units in the building, then I would have to say NO.  It is usually cheaper,  to do the maintenance, advertising, tenant screening, lease draft, and banking, yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't forget you have taxes to pay,  water/sewer, and trash pick up.<br>  <br>  Everything is dependent on the location, since this is relative to the amount of rent you can charge in an area.

vle0cV1baa	con la tarjeta de crédito, la compra o disposición de efectivo no se carga en cuenta hasta el mes siguiente, sin embargo, en las tarjetas de débito el cargo es inmediato. Por tanto con una trajeta de crédito se tiene acceso a un límite de crédito del que se puede disponer con independencia del saldo de la cuenta bancaria, mientras que la disposición en el caso de las tarjetas de débito va en función del saldo en cuenta.|`|4KNvLl8Maa	Hola<br>  <br>  Sus nombres lo dicen el la de crédito, te dan un crédito, es decir, vas a un banco y solicitas un credito, depende de muchos factores el que te la den o no. por ejemplo, checan que no estes en buro de credito, tienes que llevar comprobante de domicilio y que tus ingresos seran minimo de 5,000 pesos mexicanos (aunque esto depende de cada banco). Tambien puedes depositar dinero a tu cuenta.<br>  <br>  En contrataste con la tarjeta de debito, esta es mucho mas sencilla que te la otorgen, ahi no hay credito, el dinero que tengas en esa cuenta se soporta de depositos personales (depositos que hagas tu u otra gente, menos el banco).<br>  <br>  Espero te haya servido.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|6zDn2mfuaa	La tarjeta de crédito puedes usarla incluso cuando no hay fondos en tu cuenta bancaria (es decir, si tienes 600 euros y te gastas 900 euros, puedes pagarlo con una tarjeta de crédito, pero recuerda que tendrás que devolverlo más adelante)<br>  Si la tarjeta es de débito solo puedes gastar hasta el límite de tu cuenta bancaria, cuando no hay más fondos, tu tarjeta queda inservible...<br>  También te digo que las tarjetas de crédito tienen un máximo mensual, y que a la larga son un peligro... así que yo apuesto por las de débito.<br>  Hay que vivir de acuerdo a las posibilidades de cada uno...<br>  Fisicamente solo se diferencian en el nombre del titular, las de crédito lo llevan en relieve y las de débito impresas...<br>  (5 a?os trabajando en el comercio dan para mucho...)|`|8660ee15028298de136a0ee64cd5d5bbaa	Con la de debito sacan el dinero directamente de tu cuenta, en cmbio cuando pagas con una de credito te cobran al mes siguiente, esta es mejor a la hora de viajar porque si te queda poco dinero en el banco puedes pagar con esta tarjeta ya que se cobrará al mes siguiente.|`|7zUUgyaiaa	En la tarjeta física: Podrás ver que las letras del número de la tarjeta y tu nombre están en relieve en el caso de las de crédito, en el caso de las de débito, esta plano.<br>  En tema bancario: Las tarjetas de débito están asociadas a las cuentas corrientes normales, es decir, en principio solo puedes disponer de lo que tienes, pero en algunas ocaciones, aún estando a 0, te pagan facturas, peajes o te dejan sacar de otros bancos, según un límite que sale en el contrato (y muchas veces por error, que a mi me ha pasado)<br>  La targeta de crédito en cambio, te deja contar un límite que marca el banco, este lo amplía  la entidad según ve conveniente (es decir, si pagas, antigüedad etc)Yo por ejemplo puedo pagar todo a principios de mes, un 10% o una cuota fija/mensual... según elección de usuario. La verdad es que no se como se paga en otros bancos. El caso es que el dinero que sacas a crédito suele tener un interés bastante algo (un 12% o asi, pero eso también lo informa el banco) Y siempre que pagas algo a la targeta de crédito lo vuelves a tener disponible. Ejemplo: Mi limite es de 700€ y pago 50€/mes. El día 28 de este mes he alcanzado el límite. Para el día 5 del mes siguiente me cobran 50€, así que tengo otra vez 50€ para gastar.<br>  Espero que te haya aclarado algo.|`|DjrbUy5faa	DEBITO= tenés que contar con los fondos en la cuenta corriente o caja de ahorro, ya que como su nombre lo indica, se DEBITA (descuenta ) el gasto en el momento.

Si si, puede entonces quiero pensar que ya hablaste con el "a la buena"  y le diste ya un chorro de plazos. Entonces, estamos hablando de querer cobrarle  (a la de a bolas) la lana,  yo te propongo otra alternativa.  Para mi a la mala seria vender ese adeudo que tienes con el ,  a una empresa de factoraje financiero, obviamente no recuperaras toda la lana pues ese es el negocio de estas empresas, a la mejor recuperas los 200000 cerrados. Ya la empresa de factoraje,  se hara pelotas para cobrarle el dinero (para ese entonces ya no sera tu bronca, pues tu ya tendras gran parte de tu dinero), La otra, es obviamente el abogado. Pero el tiempo que tardan los procesos penales a veces tardan hasta meses para darte una resolucion y mas aparte sumale el costo del abogado  (como un 10% dependiendo de quien se trate, asi como de la dificultad del cobro).

The minute you give them your credit card and personal information you have now opened your computer to unwanted cookies on your hard drive, annoying pop-up windows and if you are on a PC you open your computer to viruses that can wipe you out.<br>  <br>  A lot of work to collect the "reward payments" that payout is not worth the effort over time. You will need to sign up for many types of offers, most of which require you to use a credit card. You start a week trial service with varies types of businesses or services, such as, an Internet service provider, book club, credit monitoring service, etc. to get your reward. If you don't cancel the trial, you end up being charged for the service and each service has different rules about how and when you can cancel. Very cumbersome!<br>  <br>  Since you will need to sign up for at least a dozen offers before you get to $100 in rewards, it's very easy to forget what you have signed up for, or the problems you will have canceling in time to to be charged the full amount. The Cash Create recruiters you see here over exaggerate how much money you can earn because once you've done the high-dollar trials ($8-10 each), you are left with small rewards of a dollar or two.

Certains quartiers sont limitrophes avc carrières sur seine (proche de la gare) ou avec sartrouville ( plus loin de la gare mais avec un bus qui va directe à la défense le 262). <br>  <br>  La gare de houilles est une gare SNCF avc des passages de la RATP pour le RER A. Elle est très bien desservis pour aller à la défense et paris st lazare (12 minutes avc les trains directes) Actuellement il y a des travaux dans la gare pour permettre l'installation d'un ascenceur et une meilleurs gestion du flux de voyageur. <br>  <br>  <br>  L'immobilier a bien sur bcp augmenter comme partout et Houilles étant une ville très proche de Paris par le train / RER les prix ont joué aussi sur ce fait.|`|85ff0d46c2b101c5db73fbe61d08bf5faa	Salut, <br>  <br>  J'habite a Houilles depuis a peu pres 1 an <br>  A part ca que te dire sur Houilles.......... Alors on va séparer les avantages et les inconvénients:<br>  - avantages: <br>  - le RER A et la ligne SNCF qui t'amenent respectivement a La Defense et les gares au dela et a Paris St Lazare. Par contre au niveau des bus dans la ville meme je ne suis pas trop au courant mais moi j'habite a 15 mn a pied de la gare et il faut en général que je marche<br>  - tres calme et bien fréquenté, j'habite rue Ledru Rollin, a la limte de Sartrouville<br>  - super pres de Paris dc pratique <br>  - il y ts les commerces et medecins dt on peut avoir besoin <br>  - pr une banlieue proche, le paysage est pas trop mal comparé a d'autres banlieux....<br>  et la suite au prochin épisode je viens de me rendre compte que je dois donner un cours ds 2 mn <br>  <br>  A tt a l'heure<br>  <br>  Inconvenients: <br>  - Sinon au niveau des prix, c comme partout assez cher mais cela n'a rien a voir avec Paris. Pour te donner un ordre d'idée, je paies quasiment 900 eur pour un F3<br>  - c une ville dortoire, il est bien evident que si tu veux sortir le soir... il va falloir oublier Houilles. <br>  - meme chose si tu veux faire du shopping (en meme temps il y a Les 4 temps a La Defense) <br>  <br>  Finallement, pas bcp de points noirs.....<br>  <br>  Bonne journee

11dGXLchaa	First of all, it is not possible to obtain a patent for $80, as Michelle J suggests.  Getting a patent is not simple, like getting a copyright; it is not enough merely to file an application with the USPTO.<br>  <br>  Although the electronic filing fee for inventors granted small entity status is only $75, payment of additional fees are required before a patent is issued.  Even with small entity status, the examination fee is $65 for design patents ($100 for utility), and the issue fee is $400 for design patents ($700 for utility).   And, after your patent issues, you will have to pay maintenance fees of $450 after 3.5 years, $1,150 after 7.5 years, and $1,900 after 11.5 years just to keep the patent alive.<br>  <br>  Even without paying a lawyer, getting a patent is expensive.  However, even more expensive is paying all of the required fees only to discover that a major corporation's lawyers have found a way to circumvent your patent.  If you are not a lawyer, you are unlikely to succeed in drafting claims or securing a patent that will afford you any protection.<br>  <br>  If you have invented something that's actually worth money, go the extra step and hire a lawyer.  Otherwise, companies will go the extra step and take your invention away from you.|`|lOcX7WCSaa	you must do a search of all patent's in the patent office to insure no one has ever held a patent on any part of you idea.

Still looking for a manufacturer and a company to package my product.  Good Luck to you    FYI: Please be careful if you use a company to get your product out there for you.  Many of them are scams and will cost you plenty.  Always check out the better business bureau in the area of the company before giving out your hard earned money.

4238e30e3dc5730d0c6d3dc2f7ca3143aa	If you are only 26 years old, then you are still very YOUNG.  I truly mean that.  If you have lost some of your life due to mental illness I understand how painful that could be, and its sad to lose any time of life.  BUT, you have most of your life ahead of you.  If you have a job now you are very lucky because many people are out of work.  About a girlfriend, many also do not have anyone, especially at the young age of 26.  Do not feel that you should be married, or anything else.  There are no shoulds in life;  there is only doing the best we can, each individual doing what he or she can to live well.  Don't rush away your life, live and be grateful for each day.  Try to find a good person to speak to--a therapist or someone older who you respect, to discuss your fears and anxieties.  A great book to read is HEAL YOUR LIFE, by Louise Hay.  She talks about what really matters in life and how to live well for today and the future.|`|a5KpcodFaa	One of my sons in 2001 was in a Motorcross accident and suffered permanent brain damage.

Ch9TedMcaa	Stock is simply part ownership of a company. When you buy shares of stock, you essentially "own" a part of the company.<br>  <br>  Yes. GE is always a good buy. They yield 9-10% dividend. A dividend is a payment made to shareholders for each share of stock they own. Dividends are usually paid every quarter.<br>  <br>  Ex. If you own 100 shares of stock, and the board announces a $.50 dividend, then you would get $50.00 in dividends.<br>  <br>  Let's also say that you buy those shares for $10 a share. That's a $1,000 investment. Now let's say a year from now those shares are worth $15 a share. You could sell those shares for $1,500. That's a $500 gain. Good luck.|`|qxkk9xX4aa	I've been doing this for a good while now. GE is the stock to buy right now. Haven't seen these prices in ages.

kOsJ63KFaa	Do you have your C class state lic.?  If not you can't bid jobs that take over a day and you can't exceed $500 in labor and material per day. Estimated quarterly taxes are a joke, don't pay quarterly. I wait until April 15 for the years worth taxes. Why give your money each quarter for the IRS to collect intrest on?  Plus you always end up paying too much when you sent in quarterly. No resellers lic. is needed since you are not a reseller.  Just mark up all your materials by 15% (unless its government then go to 30%).<br>   The pros are: Making your own schedule, not having to take crap from a boss, earning potentional is not fixed like at a regular hourly job, you can write off just about everything you buy.<br>   The cons: Dont get hurt or sick because no one is going to pay you sick time or workers comp., You must save your own pension fund, people will call you anytime they want because they think your open 24/7 for some reason, job security is not always certain, and that damm Self employment Tax that the feds take is BS.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	You have what you need.

Then, find a good accountant for your needs.
YC8X25OXaa	Well, it is quite hard to answer that question without knowing where you are, what experience you have and your level of qualifications. (And their relevance - e.g. it's better to have a degree in something IT-related than in, say, English!)     It's also a really huge field to work in - there are hundreds of programming jobs for computers, then related areas such as hacking (legally, obviously!).  Or you could work in the retail side of it, in a phone or technology shop. You can earn a lot in management.  There's also customer research, marketing, construction...lots!    If you want good pay then working in technology is definitely a good career area, as there is a constant requirement for consumer help and development.      My advice is to sign up with a local employment agency.  They'll be able to help you find specific jobs you want to/can go for, and help you to find vacancies and apply for them.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your help and support during my time with xxx.  I have enjoyed my work enormously and have always found the company professional, fair and rewarding to work for.  I am sad to be leaving and will miss my colleagues; I do hope to keep in touch and perhaps to return at some point in the future should a suitable vacancy arise.    Be honest - the reader will know that it is heart-felt.

X5eH20qzaa	Yes; your spouse must sign the application as the insured.  Once he/she has signed the application and completed any underwriting requirements, only the policy owner has control of the policy.<br>  <br>  Contrary to Zeuz' comment, you can be the owner of the policy, and your spouse has no control over it.<br>  <br>  .|`|U7nj9Kg4aa	yes, you need their consent.<br>  <br>  The insured person (spouse) will need to sign the policy, answer the medical questions and may have to go through the medical exams if needed.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Consent?   The spouse will be the owner of the policy.  The spouse will have to undergo a physical examination.  The spouse will have to complete an application, and sign it under oath.<br>  <br>  If that isn't consent, I don't know what is consent.|`|hUXAA4Zcaa	You can own the policy, but if he is the primary insured on the policy, he will have to sign the application (and a few other forms).  Plus, he is the person that any medical underwriting will be done on (including an interview, and possibly a medical exam, depending on the type of policy/amount of insurance), so he will obviously know about the policy- if he hasn't figured it out after signing all the paperwork.  Any insurance agent who sells you a life insurance policy for your husband would be risking losing their life/health insurance license and possibly facing time in jail.<br>  <br>  So, your answer is yes, you would need his consent.|`|xb255X0faa	They will have to sign the application and participate in any underwriting the insurance company requires (e.g. medical exams, telephone interviews).|`|w4WkD1ALaa	lifeinsurance.awardspace.info - try this one.

Follow their directions.  That's what I would do.<br>  <br>  That said, you need to cut expenses and increase income.  You can cut expenses by calling up the companies and negotiating lower interest rates.  You can increase income by getting a job now, not by going back to school.  Personally, I would cut expenses to the bone, and then figure out the best way to make more income, probably by getting a second job.

1hciyvKdaa	Hey you, ok, so just go down and apply and see ok. Now in my state on their home page is some links and stuff and I was able to see what benefits a friend could get, each state has different amounts that lets you qualify. I will go try to find that page on the CA site, they make looking for help so hard really at least in my state. Anyhow, since your living with other people, the form shows you need to add the ohter people in the home, they also want to know how much rent you pay too, its all taken into account and never ever lie about anything, during your interview the person has access to everyones info that you list, and they do need to know about your own bank accts, etc, then they ask does the other person buy thier own food and you say yes, that they do. (mom and her other family in the home, it is to only qualify you your hubby and your son but they need all info thats on the questionaire filled in) You 3 need birth certs, sos sec number cards IDs for both you adults, so if your missing any of this you can search onlien for the offices and get say the ssi address and go in with birth certs and state ids and they will give you a form to represent that you have requested new cards sent out) The thing is Ive not been in your situation so I dont know how they handle it, it is something you can apply for online and see ok. I will go find the links to help Ill edit it in. You can have mom write up a rental agreement that includes a set amount for utilities that way you have only one form. If mom wont do this, than you cannot apply as proof of residency is part of helping someone, so you have to have a note stating that she shows the address her name and address of the residence, then your name, your husbands name and the babies name.  good luck, also check at your local electric companies website for a low income application if the total that mom makes with all of you in her home, she maybe be able to get help with the monthly bill, all info on it must be honest and correct.

I was single and my roommate's fiancee moved in with us and after a while it became obvious that unless we split everything 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 someone's feelings were going to get hurt. Each person is using 1/3 of the water and toliet paper, eating 1/3 the food, taking up 1/3 of the space. It's only fair.|`|HDK10qYZaa	i would ask the single person if their fine with splitting the rent 50/50, if he or she isn't fine with it then agree on 50/50. never hurts to ask|`|ec90d00c8563d677f8dbf62cead7c1ffaa	Your renting the house as a whole.  It is split 3 ways.  There is a lot more that plays into it... such as does the couple have 1 room and their own bath.  Does the other person have their own bathroom.  With that all three still have to share the whole house so it would not be 50/50 because of that reason alone... but it would not be 33.33 either if they all have their own bathroom and the couple only has 1 room  I would average off of 50% and 33% if no sharing of bathrooms and the couple have 1 room.  That part is 50/50 the whole house such as parking, fridg pace, tv time, cleaning, and plan ol sharing a home... less stree of 2 than 3... so I would do 42%.|`|6sSZPxtHaa	I say 3 way is the most fair. Because you also should take into consideration utilities and those costs too.

A guy with 10 million dollars can put it into a high yield savings account (5%) and make $500,000 per year in interest.  The poor are always getting poorer since they have to go into debt just to survive and therefore have little to no investment potential.<br>  <br>  There are really no easy jobs that pay well.  The reason certain jobs like law, medicine, and engineering pay well is because they require a very advanced education and specialized skill set.  Also, that skill set must be able to generate large profits when put to use.  Being a mechanic is not easy, but they only bring in $10,000 in profits per month.  However, an engineer can design a car that will bring in millions of dollars per month.  <br>  <br>  There are a lot of jobs that pay minimum wage, and are hard, but in a different way.  They do not require advanced education, only manual labor.  Being a ditch digger is hard work, but any idiot can do it. <br>  <br>  As far as "its not what you know, its who you know" is both true and false.  From my experience, knowing people provides more opportunities for you to show what you know.  For instance, knowing someone in Microsoft might get you an interview, but you still have to have the skills to perform the job.

You could say (if you are young) that this is your first place on your own.  Which, in a way, it would be, because you were only renting a room before, not an apt.
cs4n4Fgzaa	Does the website where you placed this order have a frequently asked questions page, or any kind of customer service page? See what they say about shipping questions.  In general, I usually start with the company that shipped the package. If they have good customer service they'll follow up with the carrier for you. But they may tell you that you have to contact the carrier yourself. What level of delivery service did you pay for? Be sure to have your receipt and order information so you can state the facts of your claim.
e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	1. Adjectives like ("strong" experience) should be used sparingly, but I can understand why this one might be good. Just saying you have "experience" doing something could mean that you spent an hour at it once. If you have lots of experience at something, I suppose it's ok to describe it as "strong."    2. The age discrimination thing can apply to the old and the young. If I put on my resume that I graduated this year, employers will take that to mean I'm inexperienced. If I include that I graduated in 1963, they might assume I'm old and discriminate against me. So some people advise leaving it off. Your call.    3. As for home address (or other legit mailing address). There may no longer be a good reason (it used to be because you communicated via mail) but it would look suspicious to leave it off altogether!    4. I'd avoid the word "smart." It's purely subjective. Focus on words with a bit more of a tangible meaning -- expert, articulate, results-oriented, fast learner.    Good luck!

What I believe the site was talking about is called google adsense, Google adsense is basically a place were you create buttons and ads for your site. Depending on how many page views your site gets you get money. I think it's $.01 per 150 clicks or hits. (I think) There are people out there who get an enormous amount of hits per day to their site, 100s of thousands even millions of people and they make anywhere from 4 to 5 figures from google just by having the ads on their sites. However don't expect to just paste links to other peoples sites and make money.

If some of the team feel like they're not paid enough to begin with, it will be nearly impossible to get them to perform at a higher level. If a few low performers are bringing the team down, it might be time to sit down with those people one-on-one and ask them what will motivate them. If they say "pay raise", help them understand that a few bonus items like gift cards and such are more feasible than a pay raise. Gently encourage them to give you suggestions other than increased pay, and then follow through by trying those suggestions. If that doesn't help improve their performance, then you probably should consider if they really are worth retaining. In this market you could probably find more motivated employees.

GI27dKIkaa	Monitoring employee performance performs two immediate tasks.<br>  <br>  (1) It ensures the employee is carrying out his duties to the best of his abilities - highlighting possible areas for improvement. EG - an employee might undertake a practical assessment while serving a customer.<br>  <br>  (2) It enables customers to provide feedback - thus informing the employer of areas he could improve to the benefit of future business.  EG - a customer might suggest extra staff be available during busy times to speed up service through the checkout.
AlJrVK8Gaa	You must first understand how banks money to understand CD's.  Banks make money off of loaning money out and charging interest.  The money that they loan out is the money from all of the savings accounts and checking accounts that people like you keep with the bank.  However, the amount of money in all of their accounts is always changing as people deposit and withdraw money every day.  So, to help stabilize the amount of money they have, they offer accounts like CD's to guarantee that they will have stable supplies of cash on hand. <br>  <br>  A CD is a certificate of deposit.  A CD returns a fixed and guaranteed rate of return or interest rate over a certain period of time.  CD rates are higher than savings accounts.  The reason being is that once you put the money in the CD, you cannot withdraw it until the term of the CD is up.  The longer the term, the more interest they pay.<br>  <br>  For instance, if you put your $6,000 in a six month CD at 5%.  Then in return for putting the money in for 6 months without touching it, they will pay you 5% interest.  If you withdraw the money from the account at any point before the 6 months is up, then you will not get any interest.<br>  <br>  So in short, CD's are good way to get a decent return on your money with no risk (they are FDIC insured), but there is a catch ... once the money is deposited, you can't touch any of it until the term expires.
X2gYaTEVaa	It depends on your bank, but typically, if it isn't there first thing in the morning, it won't be there.

Did you efile with TurboTax?  Our return was accepted on Jan.16 and it told us our refund would be deposited by Feb.3.  Now, checking the status on the IRS site it says by Feb.10.  I see a lot of folks on here saying their refunds are also being pushed back by a week, if not two weeks.  Don't you love it?  They've been collecting OUR money all year, the economy is in the sewer, and now there are delays in getting OUR money back to us!  Economic stimulus?  Yeah, right.    In previous years, our refund has always been in the bank BEFORE the date we were to expect it.  Also, it's always there when we check first thing in the morning.  Not this year, though.  I saw another post with a similar question where an answerer said the IRS said there was some sort of "huge computer glitch," which has now been repaired.    Good luck to all of us who are waiting!

AA10249078	I asked a friend in the business. Here's his answer:<br>  <br>  "I can sympathize with you. The economic cycle is once again on the down side. The sad truth is many foundries are having difficulty staying in business and others have completely shut down. As far as your success and a good future in the casting industry depends upon your skills and the foundry you are working with or will be working with. First of all skilled melters are not common and quality skilled melters are even less. If you are truly a skilled, quality minded melter you should be able to stay gainfully employed. <br>  <br>  The second issue is the foundry you are or will be working with. Shelmet Precision Casting has been in business since 1960. We have survived 4 recessions and never laid an employee off. The question should be why are some foundries successful and others are not? <br>  <br>  Our belief is everything goes full circle. Take care of the customer and they will take care of you. Take care of the employee and the employee will take care of the business. Basically look for a business where the owners and management serve the customer and employee. The key word is serving."<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you. Good luck

There would be similar jobs in the LA area (I'm assuming you're asking thinking about moving to Pasadena, sorry if I have that wrong), but unfortunately it's very hard to get a job in LA now. There have been lots of layoffs (schools, retail businesses, banks, studios, etc) and business closings, like Circuit City, so there are lots of people who are looking for jobs. <br>  <br>  Sales jobs are tough to find right now because no one is buying anything! Even well-off people are cutting way back, because you never know who is going to be laid off next and many people in LA, even if they have a good income, have to spend so much on housing, etc that they don't have enough savings to live off of for more than a few months.<br>  <br>  Also, lots of jobs in LA require college educations even if you really shouldn't need one, like a secretary. That's because there is so much competition for jobs, even before the economy went bad, that a company can find plenty of college grads for most jobs. <br>  <br>  You can look for jobs here:<br>  <a href="http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.latimes.com/classified/jobs/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.monster.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.monster.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.careerbuilder.com/</a><br>  <br>  And sometimes companies will have job openings listed on their website, or you can submit an online resume.

Qqz0H2hEaa	If you sell it to your friend in a year there will be closing costs that you pay and costs that your friend pays (your friend might need to negotiate it so that you pay his costs for him (or her)).    When you refinance right now you will have costs.  They can either be paid by you in cash or rolled into the loan.  A rental property costs more to refinance than a homeowner occupied home costs.  All that refinance expense will be wasted if you are selling it in a year.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	You won't be able to refinance it. Nor would you get much of a rate reduction, if any at all, even if you could refinance it. For a non-owner occupied property, lenders will only go 75% loan-to-value. So, you could only get a loan for $67.5K.    Also, non-owner occupied mortgages are generally a bit higher rates than owner-occupied mortgages. And, the amount of loan fees you would have to pay to buy down the interest rate doesn't usually break even for about 5 to 7 years.    5.7% is a good rate. Just keep paying it for the next year.|`|fbqrIdkuaa	Considering that there are costs associated with refinancing, it doesn't really make sense for you to do that if you are just going to sell it.

x1AS5MbMaa	If you are carrying the mortgage on this home, then YOU should have the deed until the loan has been satisfied.  Check your paperwork and make sure the Note and Deed of Trust were properly recorded.  You may mean (your question is a little vague) that she deeded the property over to him and you still hold the original note and deed.  At any rate, if he does not pay the mortgage payment, you have the right to foreclose on the property.  The laws differ by State.  I would suggest talking to an attorney specializing in real estate law or estate law so you can get specifics if necessary.  Hopefully he doesn't have a For Sale By Owner sign up there!

y4SUDnpaaa	You could do what my husband and I do, which works very well. Open a joint account that is the household account, just for paying bills. If you haven't already figured out each one's portion of the bills you can list all your monthly bills to decide how much money you must have in the account. Then each put in half or as my husband and I did to make it fair, if one makes more than the other that person would contribute more. Keep your separate accounts and whatever is left after you've made your contribution is yours to keep and spend as you want. That way neither of you has to go to the other and ask if they can spend XXX amount of dollars and neither can criticize the other for how they spend their money. My husband and I have been married 20 years, always used this method, and never had a fight about money.|`|4a189cf0bb5e0c77392a26e3764e81f4aa	When my boyfriend and I first moved in together we opened a joint account just for rent, water, electric, and cable.

Sharing an account is for married persons only but still each should maintain thier own also. Many relationships end on bed terms and you both should be protected against that. I know sounds weird to worry about the bad, but from life experience, both need your own accounts, and divide the bills between you. If only one of you is on the lease then the other writes a check to the other person,  By keeping it seperate you will never fight on who wasted money on over draft fees. I just got one from my bank for 30 and then an additional 25 from my car ins company, thats alot of money and it would cause a fight. I can only be mad at me for making this mistake so it saves me from a fight.
ePkiOzPSaa	Firstly, you should probably take caps lock off and properly use upper and lower cases, it will get many more people to answer your question.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are not really in a situation to buy a home.  If you don't have enough money to go conventional, you may find that you don't have enough money to keep paying for the house.  A private loan may work, but it also could end up screwing you in the long run.  If you don't have the ability to get a conventional loan, will someone want to refinance you in 6 months?  You may end up with that private loan for longer than you think.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is to wait on this whole purchase.  Unfortunately, you can't really expect to buy a home and then turn around and sell it in just a few years.  This is also a terrible time to sell, and you can't really count on your house even selling, so if you can't afford this new one without your house selling, you are into another issue.<br>  <br>  Sorry to rain on your parade, but from what you've told me, this just doesn't seem like a smart decision at the moment.  Good luck.

2opG5Qaoaa	The rule for shares transaction (demat account) is first come first go. <br>  <br>  The purchased shared were kept say, in demat A/c No.1<br>  First you have purchased 100 shares @ Rs.50<br>  2nd time you have purchased 100 shares of same co. @Rs.75.<br>  <br>  Sold 100 shares @60 and delivered from demat A/c no.1.  That means the first time purchased 100 shares were sold  @Rs.50.  Your profit is Rs.100 X 10 = 1,000.<br>  <br>  But if you have two demat accounts then,<br>  You have deposited first 100 shares (@Rs.50) in demat A/c No.1<br>  <br>  Next 100 sh. were deposited (@Rs.75) in demat A/c No.2.<br>  <br>  Now, if you sell 100 shares and deliver the same from demat A/c No.2, then your loss will be 75-60 x 100= 1500. <br>  <br>  When there was no demat accounts and only share certificates, then the calculation was different.  At what rate you have purchased the particular share certificate will have to be taken into consideration.<br>  <br>  For example, if you have 100 old RIL shares (in the form of certificates) @Rs.500 per share.  You have received 100 RIL bonus shares (in certificates) at zero cost. <br>  <br>  You have sold 100 shares @Rs.600.  Now if you deliver old certificates which were purchased @500, then your gain will be 100 x 100 =10,000.  But if you deliver 100 bonus shares, your gain will be 600-0= 600 x 100= Rs.60,000.<br>  <br>  Hope you understood.|`|OZyb6acOaa	Normally most of person use FIFO system of accounting in which 'first in frist out' but it is not compalssary.

Agricultural products can  be valued by monitory terms vis-a-vis human beings and animals.  But it can not be a replacement for the food requirement.  Life is dependable on food and on getting food, economy is looked into.   Your answer, as per economic experts,  is the following :  (Take into account that ECONOMY is purely based on the COINAGE System)<br>  Banks allocate funds from savers to borrowers in an efficient manner. They provide specialized financial services, which reduce the cost of obtaining information about both savings and borrowing opportunities. These financial services help to make the overall economy more efficient.<br>  The bulk of banks' sources of funds comes from deposits - checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and time certificates. The most common uses of these funds are to make real estate and commercial and industrial loans. <br>  Banks operate by borrowing funds by accepting deposits or by borrowing in the money markets. Banks borrow from individuals, businesses, financial institutions, and governments with surplus funds (savings). <br>  Through the process of taking deposits, making loans, and responding to interest rate signals, the banking system helps channel funds from savers to borrowers in an efficient manner. Savers range from an individual with a ($) 1000 certificate of deposit to a corporation with millions of (dollars) in temporary savings. Banks also service a wide array of borrowers, from an individual who takes a loan of ($)100 on a credit card to a major corporation financing a billion-dollar corporate merger.

IRR is simply a capital budgeting technique that takes into account FUTURE cash inflows and outflows. Since these are future projections, they are never certain outcomes. IRR is basically solving for the discount rate when NPV is equal to zero. IRR can be viewed as your minimum rate of return.<br>  <br>  Most people prefer using NPV because it is simpler and more realistic. That is because NPV assumes the rate of return is EQUAL to the cost of capital (discount rate), whereas using the IRR COMPARES the cost of capital (discount rate) to the rate of return for a particular project. If the rate of return, using the IRR method is greater than the cost of capital (discount rate) then the project is accepted. As you can see IRR takes much more work and is usually unrealistic.

5XltfLhTaa	Well that website is a legit website, but it isn't a survey website in nature. But that website is a famous website so I doubt that they would do some shady business.<br>  <br>  As long as the offer is being handled by that website, and they do no ask you to pay or buy anything, I think that you might give it a shot.|`|4N1uOhaZaa	this site gives u offers  to share online greetings nothing more........i don listen any survey by this site.
QJHAkllCaa	I am doing this right now.  I found the documents online.  State of California Secretary of State website.  Search forms and fees or search LLC.  The fee is $70 but that is for you to do everything in the business to get it going and when you are up.  These other companies charge for their availability to sign for you and act as your "Agent" in California, and for filing.  Not needed for forming an LLC, you can certainly do it all yourself.  Just start googling, the answers are out there.
AA11908567	Read the documents, what does it say about late payments?|`|ARAYm7BLaa	I'm afraid that with this sort of loan you are heavily penalised if you miss a payment, you need to check your contract as I expect tit says in the small print that this will happen, best thing to do is to get a loan from elsewhere and clear it, but you'll be charged for clearing it early.
PYiQGwsAaa	i think the interest your paying 64.5% is excessive so the extra payments are well out of order|`|20lCgb6Uaa	Loan agreements are being legally challenged on a regular basis if they are not within the law. Try www.bdebtfree.info for help in getting sorted.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	You need to read through the contract and see how much the charges are for late payments, how much the charges are for every time they send you a letter etc, and calculate if they have charged you correctly - or ask them to give you a statement.  If they have there is not much you can do.<br>  You could ask them if you could pay off the loan early - and take a loan out with someone else. But that is about it.
MbwtfEC9aa	im not being horrible, but try to see where i am coming from..if you dont know the answers to the questions how are you supposed to do the job?<br>  <br>  what does safety mean to you? well, what does it mean to you? think about it. it is obviously related to your job..<br>  <br>  have you learned new techniches? what have you learned?<br>  <br>  why should they pick you? tell them your good points, why should they pick you above another person? sell yourself to them, what do you have that others dont?<br>  <br>  you have to know the answers to 7 and 8,nobody here can tell you what your weaknesses are!<br>  <br>  as for the last question, again only you know that, what would you personally like to know about the job?
aCDWwsisaa	In most States, you will not qualify for full unemployment benefits until your severance pay period is over...you should, however, file immediately to be on the record.|`|wYLWBufWaa	just apply for unemployment it takes about month for them to start paying which is probably what you got as severance pay
ZeTtadY0aa	When they go out to eat , make sure they know it's common to tip the server on 18-20 % of the check total.
