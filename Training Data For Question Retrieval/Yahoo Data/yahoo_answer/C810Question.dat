20081107200133AAuN2Dr	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	A few questions about alcohol and drinking?	1. I am a very shy person, and I am in college now. I don't know yet how alcohol will affect me, but I was wondering if alcohol loosens you up and makes you more outgoing? Just so it will be easier to meet people and socialize. I heard that sometimes it makes you even more shy. I hope not :/   2. How much alcohol does it take to loosen up and be more outgoing?   3. How is it possible to know when to stop? Because I hear all the time how people die from alcohol poisoning. I don't know how much I can drink. I am an average sized girl, about 5'4 if it is helpful to know.

20090309213329AAeHDz9	Food & Drink;Non-Alcoholic Drinks	So I'm going to go to Tim Hortons with a friend for coffee, but I almost never go there. What do I do?	Yeah, this is probably the stupidest question in the world, but it's true. I'm a guy who's going to Tim Hortons with a girl I know tomorrow. The thing is that I never go to Tim Hortons. I don't usually go for two reasons. 1, I usually don't have any money. 2, I prefer to do things on my own so I don't like asking people to make food for me. Also I happen to be a very shy and nervous person by nature, although I try to hide it. I don't drink coffee so I'm going to order tea. Here's the really stupid part. I have no idea how to ask them to make it! Last time I ordered tea from there, I got tongue tied and they made it wrong. They made it with sugar, but I forgot to tell them to add milk, and I ended up burning my tongue. It's a pretty funny story actually. I've been doing a bit better on the nervous part since then, but I still don't know what to say. I usually prepare my own with two sugars and a little bit of milk. So what do I tell them?

So, i've been at home alot lately due to unemployment and i'm recently a vegetarian, so my cupboards are filled with meatbased products. During the day i get pretty hungry.. and usually end up with a cheese and tomato toasted sandwich, but today.. we have no cheese.. and the last few days ive gone through a nutella stage.. melting it and dipping bananas into.. or apples.. so today i was about to make my cheese and tomato wrap toasted, then realising there was no cheese.. went for the nutella, trying to think of something to add to it.. peanutbutter came to mind.. but that wouldnt have cut it, i needed soething with a different texture.. but we had no bananas or apples.. the ni remmebered the pears at the bottom of the fridge .. it was awesome :)      pita bread, butter, nutella and pear slices.. folded over and toasted till melty and crisp :D:D      any other good ideas for nutella?

20090309213110AA2t6mV	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Trouble with making beer and wine?	I'm having trouble understanding the process of making home-made beer and wine.  what I am having trouble with is the sugar content in the mash before fermentation.  I have a 15% sugar concentration in my mash, does that mean that when fermentation is complete, and all the sugars are eaten up by the yeast, there will be a 15 % alcohol content in the mash?      how do I figure out the alcohol content from the beginning sugar content in the mash?    I have a triple scale beer & wine hydrometer and a proof hydrometer.  the triple scale reads  specific gravity, balling (sugar percent), and potential alcohol by volume.    comparing the scales, at 15% sugar, the % of PAV is at 7.6%.  I am guessing that means 15% sugar would yield 7.6% alcohol by vol.      also does anyone know how much cane sugar to use per gallon of water to get 15 %?  or do I figure it trial by error?      my last question. using bakers yeast, what is the highest sugar % and alcohol % that bread yeast can yield?

20090309211541AA4ZjBC	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Vegan Vs Lacto-Ovo Vegetarian?	Hi, I'm 14 and have been a vegetarian for two and a half years.  I've been wanting to become a vegan for a while now.  I've read about all the terrible things that happen to the animals, and I don't want to support that.  I just don't know if it would be too difficult to be a vegan when being a teenager.  Is there anything like being a vegan on the weekdays and then occasionally eating dairy on the weekends if there is no other options, like when I'm out with friends or on school trips.  This would not be what I would ideally want to do, but I'm just trying to be realistic with myself.  I would feel bad about eating dairy, but does anyone have any other suggestions?  Any personal stories from vegan teens about when you first became vegan and what helped you would be much appreciated! Thanks!!
