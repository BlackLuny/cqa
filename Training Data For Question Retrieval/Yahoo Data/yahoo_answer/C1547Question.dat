20090129083448AAA7NhS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does size defeat God?	On Google maps you can usually zoom in on your house.   Then you can zoom out to see your city   Then you can zoom out to see your state   Then you can zoom out to see your country   Lets say you live in the USA, which is approximately 5000 miles across.  Lets also say you can walk for an indefinite amount of time at 10 miles per hour.  It would take you about a month to walk across the USA.   The world is approximately 25000 miles around.  It would take you about 6 months to walk around the world.   The sun is 93 million miles away from the earth.  It would take you about 1500 years to walk to the sun.   The closest star to our sun is about four light years away.  That's approximately 24 trillion miles away.  It would take you approximately 40 million years to walk to the closest star.   Our galaxy has an appoximated size of 50 to 200 billion stars.  And it's about 100 thousand light years across.   From what our telescopes can see there are hundred of billions of galaxies.  The Andromeda Galaxy, the closest major galaxy, is about 2 million light years away.   So if God is the creator of the universe, and has to keep track of everything everywhere, do you really think he/she/it has time to worry about our little earth?   About your problems?   The sheer size of our universe defeats the possibility of a single intelligent creator.   If there was one, we could not fathom it's abilitites, and it would be ridiculous to believe that it would know or notice us on earth as a species and as individuals.      Relevant thought and crackpot theories being accepted.
20090129083434AASSuqF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To people who believe in evolution, why didn't dinosaurs have a missile defense shield?	If the dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years why didn't they evolve intelligence greater than humans. Many were social pack animals like wolves, killer whales and chimps. Those particular creatures are very intelligent. Weren't we supposed to increase our intelligence through our social interaction and hunting techniques.Dinosaurs had little claws for gripping like our hands.    Dinosaurs were around for hundreds of millions of years. Wouldn't the most intelligent species eventually overtake the dumber ones. The smarter ones would have figured out how to dominate the others.    Remember you don't have to be the biggest, to be the best.    Then the smarter ones should have figured out science. Like we have in only 20,000 years or so. They had hundreds of millions of years to do so.    They would have scanned space. Build missile defense shields and shot down the oncoming meteors that were about to annihilate them.    If you think this is a bizarre question, then you're not thinking hard enough.

20090129083843AAkEb7H	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Prove these Facts Wrong? Is this Jesus in the real world?	Flavius Josephus, who lived until 98 A.D., was a romanized Jewish historian. He wrote books on Jewish history for the Roman people. In his book, Jewish Antiquities, he made references to Jesus. In one reference he wrote:      About this time arose Jesus, a wise man, who did good deeds and whose virtues were recognized. And many Jews and people of other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. However, those who became his disciples preached his doctrine. They related that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive. Perhaps he was the Messiah in connection with whom the prophets foretold wonders. [Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, XVIII 3.2]      Pliny the Younger, proconsul in Asia Minor, in 111 A.D. wrote to Emperor Trajan in a letter:      ...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turns a form of words to Christ as a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but not to commit theft or robbery, or adultery, not to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded. After this was done, their custom was to depart, and meet again to take food...      Roman historian, Tacitus, who is respected by modern scholars for historical accuracy, wrote in 115 A.D. about Christ and His Church:      The author of the denomination was Christ[us] who had been executed in Tiberius time by the Procurator Pontius Pilate. The pestilent superstition, checked for a while, burst out again, not only throughout Judea...but throughout the city of Rome also...       Other secular witnesses to the historical Jesus include Suetonius in his biography of Claudius, Phlegan recording the eclipse of the sun during Jesus' death and even Celsus, a pagan philosopher. It must be kept in mind that most of these sources were not only secular but anti-Christian. These secular authors, including the Jewish writers, had no desire or intention to promote Christianity. They had no motivation to distort their reports in favor of Christianity. Pliny actually punished Christians for their faith. If Jesus were a myth or His execution a hoax, Tacitus would have reported it as such. He certainly would not have connected Jesus' execution to Roman leaders. These writers presented Jesus as a real historical person. Denying the reliability of these sources in connection to Jesus would cast serious suspicion on the rest of ancient history.      Now these ancient secular writings do not prove that Jesus is the Son of God or even the Christ, but that is not the goal of this tract. These reports show that a virtuous person named Jesus did live in the early first century A.D. and authored a religious movement (which still exists today). This Person was at least called Christ - the Messiah. Christians in the first century also appeared to consider Him God. Finally these writings support other facts found in the Bible surrounding His life. The claim that Jesus never existed and His life is a myth compromises the reliability of ancient history.

20090129083956AABgc2g	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How do we find meaning in this robotic/godless world we live in?	I mean it's all about business/money, and it's at a lightning fast speed with people multi-tasking, that it's seriously become EXTREMELY robotic, in many aspects, and there literally is absolutely no higher meainng, purpose or God to any of it, aside from the common goal for people to make money and succeed at any expense, and keep pushing our society the way it is...the working hard, the taxes, all of that stuff....but also the corruption remains.      People end up thinking "there is no god, nothing matters, i can do whatever i want," and end up basically becoming money oriented robot soulless drones, or might do things like hobbies, etc...but eventually it's just all meaningless, and same old, same old, same old, day in and day out. OMG, my frequent flier miles, omg I have to get a great rate on that mortgage loan, it all becomes literally consumed with yuppie-like ideals and values, and that's what it's like 24/7.      Nothing else seems to matter; all about money.      That's what living in America is like at least by the major cities, and that's what 1st world countries are all about.      Money, intellect, business, money, intellect, business, self-interest, power, yadda yadda yadda yadda.      I mean...      how does one break away from this, and still succeed, or find meaning within it?         I mean it's just so annoying. Another day, another dollar, another doctor another lawyer, another business, another hair appointment, another phony smile, another this, another that, another beggar, another car oil change...      and you do this till the day you die.         This is greatly depressing.

20090129083939AAKVAf3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Spiritually speaking, should I wear a necklace in light of what my priest told me?	basically he said since many dictionaries consider a necklace to be two things: (1) adornment about the neck and (2) worn typically by females, we can assume there is an effeminate connotation to wearing a necklace. While this may not always be true, the Bible takes such a strong stand against the effeminate, that we should, as a matter of practice, stay as far away from the confusion as possible. Therefore, MEN should not wear necklaces for the purpose of adornment.

Like for example this one girl just looked at him and I totally flipped out. And I flip out even when he just talks to another girl. I know I'm going way overboard here, but I can't help it. I don't know what to do. I love my boyfriend and I seriously want him to be the right one, and I know I'm holding on too tight. I keep telling myself to stop, but I just CAN"T. I've been through a lot of abuse and rape by boyfriends and people. And I know that me still trying to get over my past is playing a role of why I'm so protective over him. And its not just girls either. I don't mind him having guy friends, but I still get a little jealous because they take his attention away from me. And I'm very very protective of myself too. I hate other people looking at me, I hate guys, I just think there disqusting. And I notice I look at girls more than I do guys. But I'm inlove with my boyfriend, and i won't even but just look at girls, that's as far as I go with them. But I just flip out when somebody even tries to flirt with me (Sometimes even girls) or try anything with me at all. And I'm thinking maybe me being so protectvie of myself too could be the reason I'm so protective and jealous over him. Because I care about him just as much as I do myself. I don't know what to do. Can ya'll please give me some advice??

My family told me he was on the phone hiding the whole time he was there.       Theres a woman he had just broke it off with supposedly two weeks before. Im guessing it was her he was talking too. He says no..      I moved back to Hawaii on the 16 of dec 2008. a day after I got here the other woman text him saying shes pregnant. He admitted to me that when he came back from visiting me in calif that he had been sleeping with her befor i got here... Now im having the worst time trusting him,,, and he gets angry sometimes because he says i cant let it go.. Im so loving to him, (I show him that i forgive him,,, but sometimes I have questions about things...Like some thing hes told me doesnt add up... then i cant let it go.. ) im always trying to please him,, loving on him constantly, telling him how much i love him,,,       trust me its pathetic, the way i act and how insecure I am now...      I think the reason I cant move on and quit living in the past is because this woman is pregnant with my husbands baby, she still text him talking about the appointments she has with doc... the latest one is that shes flying to honolulu to have an abortion.... she tells him the time the date and that shes flying back same day... i know she wants him to go with her.. why else would she give all that info?... he says he tells me about every text... and that he doesnt want to be with her...      You gotta help me.. i feel pathetic.. i wanna be with him but i dont wanna be the dumb wife who caters to her husband and kisses him feet only to never find out that hes still seeing or talking to her..      Oh and hes always with me so i know he hasnt seen her since i been here..but im so scared if i let him go any where with out me that he will go see her.      we were at the grocery store the other day and he saw her and we put everything back and left in a hurry...      oh one more thing,,, lately hes admitted to me that our whole time together 24 years... hes cheated on my continuisly....

Change as in, if pagans see us having this "mother goddess" type figure, then they wont convert because they'll think that Christianity is just like what they believe in.     So if we got rid of/great down play the role of Mary in Christian doctrine, pagans would then see that Christianity is different from paganism, and then they'd convert.

Scriptures (to list a few);      Mat 18:15-17  "If your brother sins against you, go and rebuke him in private. If he listens to you, you have won your brother. (16)  But if he won't listen, take one or two more with you, so that by the testimony of two or three witnesses every fact may be established. (17)  If he pays no attention to them, tell the church. But if he doesn't pay attention even to the church, let him be like an unbeliever and a tax collector to you."      Psa 119:163  "I hate and abhor falsehood, but I love Your instruction."      Pro 10:18-20  "He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.  (19)  In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.  (20)  The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth."      Pro 12:20  "Deceit is in the hearts of those who plot evil, but those who promote peace have joy."      Eph 4:29  "No rotten talk should come from your mouth, but only what is good for the building up of someone in need, in order to give grace to those who hear."      So, from the standpoint of a Christian, is this a situation in which you uncover the deceit for the benefit of the listeners or stay out of it and mind your own business and let them suffer for being gullible?    Thanks in advance for your answers!

20090129084927AAZCtHI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christianity in some ways is crippling me and making me an easy target. Help.?	I've become a nicer person and tried to be helpful/friendly/supportive, but that's actually crippled me in the world and made me an easy target. How you ask?  Well, I now get approached by five times as many beggars, people who supposedly represent charity organizations and all sorts of people, who wont leave me alone and keep bugging me for things, and taking advantage of my niceness, whereas before...when I was all about myself and meaner, they were nowhere to be found, almost like they didn't exist.      Now it's like, they sniff me out somehow and they're there.         How can I remain a Christian, and be a good person, but not be an easy target for these people, because I  literally feel like I'm being thrown out to the wolves out there. Literally, adn they sense it somehow and try to con me and all sorts of things.         Christianity is dumbing me down and making me less effective in the real world; for real. It is, and I'm sick of it and angry at it for doing so, but at the same sense, I do want to find higher meaning and grow closer to God, but the more I do that, the less I have in common with the world, so the less I'm inclined to care and succeed in it, the poorer I get, the more people pick on me and target me....      it seems like a bad situation.         At least when you're godless and mean, people stay away from you and leave you alone lol.         But for real what do I do and how do I make this work and yet not become a total unsuccessful loser in the real world and get 1000000 people to target me for money.
20090129085627AABd5zR	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you want to know what Madoff's strategy was to keep stealing, cheating and defrauding so long?	Here is his strategy:   a. He enticed charities, which are organizations, who would be less hostile if he were exposed, unlike individual investors who lost their all in all, who would be outraged to violence. To fortify his concealed fraud and theft, he got into the directorate of the particular charity, or one of his family did, so that if anything was brought up, he'd get ear of it and either silence it or cover it up specially.    b. To create the appearance of exclusivity and class, so that whatever invester was accepted, would be grateful and less likely to look deep down.      c. He’d screen carefully every person who wanted to place funds with him - To investigate the specific investor - He'd hire investigators to go into every detail of the potential investor's business activity, credit background, marital involvements etc and if there were indications of tax fraud or divorce fraud, he'd take them in as investors. He wanted to see if the applicant’s financial activities were such that the money he was giving to Madoff was concealed tax fraud, that plenty of monied people have, and they seek places where the monies can remain concealed in a larger fund composed of many investors. Madoff knew that if the fraud ever was found out, these investors with shady assets that the IRS would immediately check into if these persons names surfaced as persons with claims against Madoff, then these people would just go away and take their loss rather than face criminal or civil charges by the IRS. so Madoff had a ready made gag over the mouths of many, many individual investors who he ripped off, knowing they would never open their mouths to regulators to protect themselves.   And as for the alleged “innocence” of his two sons. They knew plenty about it. Madoff didn’t want their lives destroyed by his evil, so it was agreed that when the matter was about to bust out, the sons would play the role of heroes unveiling Madoff so they would avoid prosecution.   Real nice family, isn’t it?

Women may not care about looks as much but in my opinion they do care about race.  Here is why.  I'm puerto rican and i'm white but most women don't know that i'm white and they already know i'm hispanic.  I live in wisconsin and i don't get much attention from white girls which i figure they might hate me or not give me a chance because i'm not white or black.  It's true white girls would rather go out with a black guy or a white guy than a hispanic guy especially here in wisconsin.  This is what i experience here and it's bothering me to the point in which i hate my own race.

Hi, Iived in a terraced house for over a year now and in the last 2 weeks my neighbour has started to bang on the walls. The house next to them occupied by young men (19+ ) and they go out and come back quite late, often making noise. The noise isn't that audible from our house. On arrival from a night out , my imediatte neighbours will start to bang on the wall between them and these lads, which can be heard from our side and often wakes me up.      My room is closest to them and for over a year i have had a tv in my room which doesnt make any noise and it has been on, on every night i have slept in the room. The volume on the tv is so low, that if i were to open my door and stand at the bottom of approx 10 stairs it's inaudible. One of the "old" people moved in to the room nearest to me  (escaping the other side) and is now banging on my wall whenever the tv is on. The tv volume cannot be heard from my parent's bedroom which is adjacent to my room let alone a different house. The tv is not on all night , and even during the day they will bang on the walls.      How do i deal with this, because it's starting to get to me. We could all bang on walls , but quite frankly im not that childish.    what would you do ?

I've actually been feeling pretty s8icidal lately, and it's not in the typical upset/depressed way, so don't think I"m going to do it. more in a purely philosophical way, like "to be or not to be, that is the question." lol, largely because I just see no point or purpose to any of this, the way humanity is is VERY discouraging, the things we do/value, its all business, the corruption and the cut-throatness, the injustice, the crime, the physical ailments, the getting older part, the watching your loved ones die....life is just filled with so much....that even the "temporary" good things really don't seem to do much, long term.         With the way the world is, how it's going, money is god mentallity, the shallowness of people, and how no one really cares,         and the possibility of getting sick/dying, etc,         I ask, is this world REALLY worth living in?      I personally think no, but it's very sad that I have to think that way too.            Also, it's SO easy to become disillusioned with the world. Sucked into how the media portrays it, how it should be and all of that other stuff, rather than how it is in all reality.         Have you ever personally been disllusioned, and fell for the "lies" of what reality really should be like?

Any type of sex goes, gay/lesbian/animals/group....the human being has now become a sex toy with holes for people, sex has become an industry/ a scene...girls and guys work out and get implants and all sorts of stuff,      then we have the corporate culture...at lightning pace, every second..its all about omg, which stocks should we buy now, which should we sell, what's going up, what's going down...it's all about work work work work work, money money money, my portfolio, my this my that, and when they're not doing that, they're either having fun, clubbing, s9x, drugs, whatever.      Oh and if you don't conform to that, and aren't like them,..then you're the loser or the bad guy.      America is just so...soulless to me,
20090129090136AAqJRCJ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do people expect you to be a conformist and act/behave/value what they do or what the majority does?	It's like everywhere I go, whether a bank, a church, a store, out and about,,...everyone generally looks the same, or in character, or whatever...or fakes it, and when you talk to alot of people they all sound so similar and robotic, like, oh it's all about work, we value this, maturity, all sorts of sameness and conformist ideals, and expect the same from you,and when you decide to go against that, dress provocatively, or differently, value different things, and march to the beat of your own drummer...they start giving you nasty/weird looks, treat you like total sh9t, are bewildered and disguisted...and just act all "well, if you're not like me...then you must be bad."       The doctors/hospitals..when you go in there, the hair salons, wherever you might be..they expect you to act a certain "fake" society way, and if you don't....they don't like you and think you're "weird."         Why all the conformity, and the expectation to be predictable like that, and how does one get around that?         It's literally how it is.

20090129093330AAK4WP6	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Do you think the media should stop using certain terminology?	Well, like at a casino, people 'lose' money but they really 'spend' it. Ford 'didn't make' money, but lose it? I think they made bad business moves and should not be bailed out because their business model is bad. Obviously it is their fault, if they did not spend millions on their CEO's then don't you think they wouldn't have 'lost' so much? They 'lose' money but still everyone in the company got paid, or laid off I guess, but don't you think if everyone earned based on profits, then the CEOs would actually do some work other than lip service, right? The terminology makes you think, poor Ford, they lost money, but if they worded it technically and said, "Ford spend $5 billion this quarter" it would have a different impact on readers. I understand there are investors and stock holders, but someone has to take blame for it and don't you think they should change their structure?       Basically, the media hypes things up and it causes backlash because people feel sorry for Ford because they see it as a 'loss' but really what it is, they 'spent' the money. They spent it to pay their employees and spent it on overhead and spent it on marketing, etc. I think if the media stopped mixing up words and said things more literally, it would stop making people panic andbring reality into the picture.      You don't really 'lose' money at the casinos, you 'spend' it. I know it is a way for people to feel better because it sorta puts the blame elsewhere. Awww bummer you lost money... rather than .. hahah you idiot, you spent the money on what?      I'd like to see the media fined for bending the truth and affecting so many people with their trickery. I understand the media is in business to make money, as is everyone, essentially, but when is mankind going to stop being so gluttonous and start being realistic? Hopefully, after this 'recession' Americans will stop being selfish and buying materialism and start helping out their neighbors in need.

Recently, on a trip to a Dominican Republic resort, I saw a person digging a massive hole, and then sitting in it. When I pointed it out to my husband, he said "Oh, he must be German." Upon this response, I inquired further.      My husband who is dutch said that the Germans like to go to beaches and dig holes and sit in them. They said if you ever seen a person on a European beach digging a hole or sitting in it then it is more than likely a German person.      Here is a quote from www.urbandictionary.com about the Germans:    "A nation of people who are fanatical about David Hasselhoff, and when they go to beaches--either in their own or in other countries; they're always digging holes!". So you see, it is not just my husband.      What causes this hole digging desire?

I enjoy making others laugh, and I like laughing a lot myself. I also like helping others when they need assistance. Some might call me a goofball, but I know they mean that in a good way.       As a freshman in college, I have discovered that people like to joke around with me....a lot. Now, I'm all for joking around, but it has its limits. Even when I mean something in a serious sense when dealing with my friends, I still am not taken seriously a lot of the time. I don't know what could be causing this.

(cartoon)         so i took a picture,  but i was afriad to go near it   then my sister came and carried it       then she started playing with it like a baby   and then it started to cry, it even started to talk, it called her mommy      then before u know it, it grew again like a 3year old baby   u could see the face..and the skin was looking dry. (almost flaky)     then i  shaked the babies hand it was a girl    and she ask what my name was       then before u know it..the baby grew into a 15yr old girl   her skin was still a little dry...then she now started talking    her skin almost look like rubber       she said that she's from another planet, and she had several messages      she said the planet she's from is very far..and that earth is very hot thats why her skin is dry      she said it cost her $182 billion dollars to travel, but she said american dollar is higher than their money      then she was about to give me the messages...but i woke up      then i fell asleep again..and i started seeing numbers and dates      the first date was Dec 12th, 2012 (i know what u're thinking)      then I saw one of my friends..and it said 41 days before Dec 12th, 2012..he will have a child (which is Nov 1st...looked on the internet and thats the day of the dead in mexico)      then i saw 63...and i saw one mans picture next to it      then i saw 32, then 23...   then i saw it like 3223.      i woke up.. at 5am..and i felt like someone was on my bed      Any ideas what this means?

20090129090959AAnnBc4	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Why are humans so murderous?	Maybe I'm just never meant to understand why, because I will never be them, but why are humans so murderous? They catch and kill innocent animals and stand over them with smiles as their friends take pictures. I've seen so many images of them proudly holding up the pelts of wolves and grabbing them by the neck as they die by an arrow in their heart. Humans have always murdered us. Even when we look like them, they still don't care. They have no problem burning us on crosses and shooting us down. Such sick little creatures. And what have we done to deserve it? Seriously, what in the world have we done except be their protectors? I would hope that, after what we did for them so many years ago, some of them would have some respect. I, personally, take pity on humans. I don't understand why they are the way they are, and I can never change them. I'm sure so many of them are reading this right now and thinking of the perfect insults for me. They don't want to accept that they aren't the greatest beings in th universe. And so, they kill us. They hunt us down for no reason and then cry and complain when one of theirs is taken by us.     Eventually they will have to face the fact that their are really only two solutions to their whole population problem. Either they make a deal with us and allow us to take the weaker, more evil ones of their kind, or they wait until they are nearly destroyed by famine when the Earth can no longer sustain them. In the second option however, they will most likely take many species with them, not to mention destroy the planet as they have been so quickly and uncaringly doing. If they choose the first, most of them will live, and then maybe the Earth can get back up on her feet.    I don't want to see the humans die out. But I also don't want them to purge my kind. And so, I must ask: why are they the way they are? Why are they so murderous?

I just met this guy a couple of weeks ago through a friend. He and I have been on several dates... but we can't seem to get past 1st base.      He always touches me, and smiles and looks at me often. He tells me how pretty I am. So I took it as his way of being flirty. So at the end of our 2nd I felt the urge to kiss him... so I did... but I got the feeling from him that he didn't want the same although he kissed me anyway. Anytime we've hung out thereafter... I have allowed him to make the first move. So as not to be rejected. And he has... but it's just light pecks on the lips.      I'm trying not to rush things... but I am so attracted to him it's hard not to. Just last night we were laying in his bed playing... you know tickling and carying on. Many times I straddled his torso... but he would just flip me off and continue playing.      Okay... why do I think he "could be" gay. Well... just little things. He's 30... single... no kids. Seems to be a perfect catch for any woman. He's been living with his roommate (a guy) for at least 5 years. He's heavily into fashion too... has over 200 pairs of shoes and notices every little thing about me from my eyelashes to the brand of clothes and shoes I wear.

20090129111805AAQNcIw	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How to politely get rid of unsolicited advice?	I have a beautiful little girl who has a birth defect (Vesicoureteral Reflux, it's nicknamed VUR)where her ureters both have holes in them so her urine runs backwards into her kidneys causing infections galore. She has a high grade (pretty severe) We have her on medication to protect her kidneys cause too many infections and she has the possibility of having a kidney transplant. Hopefully, this will heal itself by the age of 6 or 7 years old without surgical intervention. Yes, she is closely watched by a specialist and her DR.      Here is the issue: She is going to be 3 in August. She is no where near being potty trained partly because she doesn't have the same kind of feelings that a child with no issues has. When people find out she isn't potty trained, I get unsolicited advice telling me how I am "doing it wrong" My wife and I decided not to push her whatsoever because it really isn't her fault she can't feel all the way. We are letting our daughter not feel bad at all for having accidents and are taking a carefree approach to it in general. All of our family is in complete support of this.      How do I tell people to butt out and leave her alone without being completely rude or having to explain her entire medical history??

20090129095055AAV7cCF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians are constantly attesting ?	that they are under a "New Covenant"...are they?      Is it possible that due to their lack of scholarship that they are mistaken and have relied on emotionalism rather than textual facts from the Bible which, when recognized, dispute their claim?      The Christian may attempt to answer that verses 32 and 33 in Jeremiah are talking about the second coming, but it's absurd to say that there is at least a 2,000 year gap between verses 31 and 32. There is no indication of this gap in the text, quite the opposite, in fact. It appears as one prophecy. The Christian answer is illogical, and born of desperation.             If the Christian New Testament was really the fulfillment of this prophecy, why are their so many atheists in the world?      Why do Christians spend millions of dollars to missionize if the New Covenant has arrived and everyone "knows God"?

As this is the first time i am in this country, i had some difficult moments with the language at the beginning. The problem is that instead of trying to be supporting, my boss and the nurses are making jokes of that.   Which frustrates me really much and is the reason i could not improve my proficiency of the german language at all for the last 2 months.   And when my boss humiliated me before about 10 nurses. She said smth i could not at first understand and then she just repeated the same thing 3 times with exactly the same words, looking at me as if i was an idiot to not understand, which made the nurses laughing and joking about that. I was so embarrassedd, i could not say a proper sentence and just left the meeting.   Plus, cos i have only 1 yr working experience, the nurses treat me as if i am some kind of mentally retarded and ignore me almost all the time. Instead of being tought i am all the time pushed to do stuff i am not ready for. And after that - looked at as if i am a complete idiot and of course "oh, you know, in our universities in Germany we do this and those so good, obviously in your country you haven't been taught that well..."   Please, could anyone give me advice what to do and how to fight this harassment and humiliation.   I am so frustrated that my german even gets worse and worse.

I'm currently a student at an Ivy Tech Community College in Indiana but at the moment I'm really not able to study what truly interests me here.  That would be asian culture and language, I'm especially interested in Japanese but I also like Korean, Chinese, Thai etc..  Once I get out of Ivy I'm wanting to go for a major in either asian studies or a particular asian language.  I'd also really like to be able to study for a term or a year during college in one of these nations if possible.          So basically, I was wondering if anyone one knew of any particularly good colleges in Indiana for studying these things. I've already looked into some of the bigger universities, (Purdue, IU, DePauw, Ball State etc.) but I'd like to keep my options as broad as possible and I just don't know that many private universities and such to look into.  Anyway, thanks in advance for any help that you can offer.

I lift the seat and go, but when I'm done, I'm faced with a dilemma.      Should I put the seat back down and risk the woman behind me in line thinking I didn't lift the seat?  Or should I leave the seat up, ensuring they know I didn't pee on the seat, but making think I'm inconsiderate?      To break it down further, here's a scenario.  Women, who would you prefer:      Guy A, who walks out of the bathroom with the seat up.      Guy B, who walks out of the bathroom with the seat down.      Who do you like more?

20090225120234AA0ohbN	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, how does this "praying for people to get better" work for you?	The asker of this question (  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...  ) claimed:   "I had a relative that had cancer and the doctors that treated her at the hospital thought she might die but she had faith in Jesus. That's just one example that is a miracle."      So I'm just wondering... when you pray for your friends and family to get better, what happens?      If there's a disease with a 10% survival rate, for example, one of these three possibilities is true:      1. Praying for someone does not increase their chances of survival.      2. Praying does increase the individual's chances of survival, but harms the chances of nobody else - in this case, it should be very easy to verify that people who are prayed for have a higher survival rate than other people given the same medical care.      3. Prayer does increase the chances of survival, but cannot be detected statistically, because God balances it by having somebody not survive who otherwise would, so when you pray for your family and friends to survive, you are causing somebody else to die.      Which one is it?

20090225122715AAs3CyP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think being fat is a sin?	like if you are fat just to be fat. I am not talking about people who have medical conditions and they can not help it. I am talking about the lazy people who all they do is eat and eat constantly. Isn't being selfish and eating sooo much the same thing as being extremely rich? I think it is. The catholic church says that if you are wealthy it is a sin, yet the catholic church division is one of the richest organizations in the world and they just beg for donations. There are starving children in the world and they don't have food, so the catholic church means that if you are wealthy you have to share you money AND if you are fat you have to share you food.       :)

20090225111753AAiuray	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	No way out for Christians?	Jesus word:   "But when you see the ABOMINATION  OF DESOLATION standing where it should not be (let the reader understand), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains." Mark 13:14   “Furthermore, when YOU see Jerusalem surrounded by encamped armies, then know that the desolating of her has drawn near"   Luke 21:20   "Because the days will come upon you when your enemies will build around you a fortification with pointed stakes and will encircle you and distress you from every side,"  Luke 19:43      Those prophecies were fulfilled in 66 C.E when the Roman governor of Syria, Cestius Gallus, marches south with 30,000 troops to suppress the Jewish rebellion. His army arrives at Jerusalem during the Festival of Booths and quickly penetrates the suburbs.   If the city was encircled how was it possible for Jesus followers to OBEY his command to flee to the mountains?  They did not fight so what happened?

20090225125208AATdJRC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would my fellow atheists kindly cease using the incorrect statement, "You cannot prove non-existence?"?	Here is one you can most certainly prove:      There are no two integers, (a, b), such that a and b are co-prime and that a/b = sqrt(2).      This is a non-existential statement.  I am saying that there does NOT exist such a pair.      I can easily prove this via contradiction -- I assume that such a pair exists, and I show this inevitably leads to a contradiction (I won't quote it here, but I'll cite a reference --  http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/p...  )      So if it is possible to prove a non-existence (given a testable definition), why do so many of my fellow atheists seem compelled to endlessly cite the "can't prove non-existence" fallacy?

NO heterosexual can tell you why they are straight?      I don't get it.

Because some in the black community will not let it. Let it go. We can't remember every derogatory remark or reference. Gay doesn't even mean what it used to in the 1920's.

The whole idea of nudity seems quite liberating to me, and i would like to access it more, but at the moment i can't. Any ideas how i can become more comfortable naked?  And before anyone suggests its it's not a homosexuality thing as it happens even if there's no one else in the changing room.   Thanks :)

The action started at 9 a.m. and run till 5 p.m.    In the action participated the just 7 older members from “Zdravec 2002” because of the inaccessibility of the lakeshores. Either the police, local communal inspector, keeper of the dam and employees in the hydroelectric power plant were previously informed.     A considerable amount of plastic bottles was taken out from the water surface and being collected in nylon bags on the land. The members of the Society had been heavily working at heat and after 8 hours all the particular bottles from the locality Prepish were swept off.

Do you think that the capitalist system is really working behind the unions to support them, by making working conditions so unreasonable that people decide to join or establish them as a last measure?

20090128110043AArU9AX	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Seeking forgiveness is a means of strengthening the body?	I do body building to develop my physical strength, and my aim is jihad for the sake of Allaah.     1- Does praying for forgiveness give strength to the body? What are the times when we should ask Allaah for forgiveness, and how many times should we ask?    2- I hope that you can tell me some du’aa’s or dhikrs for increasing strength.          Praise be to Allaah.       You have done well by forming this good intention for your exercise, for a good intention turns a habit into worship.       As for what you have asked about, whether praying for forgiveness increases a person’s strength, the answer is Yes. Allaah, may He be exalted, tells us that His Prophet Hood (peace be upon him) said to his people (interpretation of the meaning):       “And O my people! Ask forgiveness of your Lord and then repent to Him, He will send you (from the sky) abundant rain, and add strength to your strength, so do not turn away as Mujrimoon (criminals, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allaah)”      [Hood 11:52]       Ibn al-Qayyim said in al-Waabil al-Sayyib (p. 77), when listing the benefits of dhikr, including praying for forgiveness:       Benefit no. 61:       Dhikr gives a person strength so that he can do with dhikr that which he cannot do without it. I saw wonders in the strength of Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyah in walking, speech, courage and writing. He used to write in one day what a scribe would write in a week, or more. The troops saw his amazing strength in war. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) taught his daughter Faatimah and ‘Ali (may Allaah be pleased with them) to recite tasbeeh thirty-three times every night when they went to bed, and to recite tahmeed thirty-three times, and to recite takbeer thirty-four times, when she asked him for a servant and complained to him about the hardship of grinding corn, working and serving (her family). He taught her that and said: “It is better for you than a servant.” It was said: The one who persists in doing that will find strength in his body that will make him independent of the need for a servant. End quote.       With regard to the times for dhikr and the number of times it should be repeated, the believer should remember Allaah at all times and in all situations. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):       “Those who remember Allaah (always, and in prayers) standing, sitting, and lying down on their sides”      [Aal ‘Imraan 3:191].       The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) would remember Allaah at all times. Narrated by Muslim.       So one should remember Allaah a great deal and pray for forgiveness. The more he does that, the better.       Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):       “O you who believe! Remember Allaah with much remembrance. 42. And glorify His Praises morning and afternoon [the early morning (Fajr) and ‘Asr prayers]”      [al-Ahzaab 33:41, 42]       “and the men and the women who remember Allaah much with their hearts and tongues. Allaah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward (i.e. Paradise)”      [al-Ahzaab 33:35].       Muslim (2702) narrated from al-Agharr al-Muzani (may Allaah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I ask Allaah for forgiveness one hundred times a day.”       And Abu Dawood (1516) narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said: We used to count when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said in one sitting one hundred times: Rabb ighfir li wa tubb ‘alayya, innaka anta al-tawaab al-raheem (Lord forgive me and accept my repentance, for You are the Accepter of repentance, the Most Merciful). Classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh Abi Dawood.         Islam Q&A         -whats the du'aa that u always say for seeking forgiveness?(i love sayido L2ESTEGHFAR)..   -and do u always say 'astaghfiro LLAH' one hundred times? or is it from time 2 time?      thanks for reading and sharring.   salam.

I'm a female born here in the U.S. and have dated men that were born here as well, and foreign men. Specifically from Mexico, Colombia, and Lebanon. One thing that I have noticed is that men born here seem so boring and timid. It's like they don't embrace their masculinity. There is no challenge with American men. It's gotten so bad that I'm not even attracted to men from here anymore, despite weather they're Caucasian, African American, Hispanic, Asian, Arab etc. If they were born in the states, I don't like them.    Does anybody else notice this about American men? What are your thoughts on it?      Please no rude/racist answers.

Anyway, I have a lecture to go to so I won't be able to edit. The class will finish in an hour and a half. So don't expect me to reply within five minutes and when I dont rebuttal ..then reply "SEE I KNEW YOU COULDN'T ANSWER, I WIN SHIAS RULE"  **rolls eyes**      Ma' Al Salama.

Hi everyone ^^         I'm asking this question because soon I will go to America with an English friend for a photography project (I am a student and also a photographer). The trip will last 3 weeks, and I do realise that my question is quite silly because we can't make generalitys, however, yahoo made me suddenly paranoid lol       Here in France the cliches about the Americans are innumerable : fat, stupid, loud, uneducated, over religious ... et cetera). But most of the people here knows that all this are just cliches.We are not stupid.       In spite of that, I noticed that in the U.S. side many people do not make the distinguish between a cliche and a fact.       I'm actually very exited to go for the first time in America, and it's always fantastic and rewarding to discover another culture (I love to travel). But now I am a bit scared, so I want a frankly and honest answer.      Do I may being rejected by ,not everybody, but many people there?

20090128124652AALnStb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists Help? God of the Gaps & Science of Gaps?	Hello everyone,      First, I never get on here and rant or put down any member of any religion (or no religion). I always have respect for everyone. But I would like to ask you a question and hear you honest thoughts.      God of Gaps- According to Wiki this basically means people who believe in God attribute unknown things to God.      I personally hold the view that God created all things, and science explains the "how." When I don't know something, I view it as beyond the laws of our universe,  science just hasn't exlpained it (or God hasn't revealed it).      I recently was told that I believe in "God of the gaps" during a debate.      But doesn't science do this very thing? So don't they believe in "Science of the Gaps"      Examples: A person says a miracle happened. An atheist says an unexplained or unknown scientific process. Is this not science of the gaps? They don't know why, but they automatically assume science.      Another example: The origins of the big bang. They have theories, but don't know the full answer of everything. So isn't this "Science of the Gaps?      I appreciate your objective response, and have a great day!

I believe that our outward appearance should have no effect on who we are as people. Boys and girls can share the same interests and wear the same clothes.      If this is true, I am curious as to why I am gay. Set aside everything physical....I am attracted to androgynous men. I like boys who are emotional and creative, yet athletic and intelligent. I like boys who have a good balance of 'feminine' and 'masculine' traits. I like boys not only physically, but emotionally. I could never fall in love with a girl.      This confuses me....though. If I believe that men and women, boys and girls should and do have the same interests and traits, then why could I only fall in love with a man? It is not just a physical thing for me. I am romantically attracted only to guys, but I dont know why, because I like guys that can be feminine.
20090128125139AAgPApi	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the church perceived as an elitist organisation? ?	I have a friend who was brought up on a council estate, but did well academically and is now doing pretty well for himself. He said when I still lived in council housing, he started doing a bit of "soul searching", and decided to try attending Church of England services, just to see if anything clicked really.      His conclusion was that the CoE seemed to be an elitist organisation and in the modern day serves as little more than a social club for the Upper-Middle and Upper Classes. He said that people from Working Class backgrounds were not made to feel welcome and certainly not encouraged to attend.      Do you feel this analysis has basis and do you feel it is fair to say it? Also, he was going to a church in a more rural area, prehaps if he had gone to a Church in a town or city his experience may have been different?      Also, is it only CoE that has developed this reputation, or have all major organised religions developed the perception of being classiest and elitist.

I asked the other day if you could say whether or not some religions are phonier than others, and you said that all religions are equally phony. But do you think some religions require a greater rejection of reality and discourage people from using their brains more than other religions? Take those American religions for example; the tenets of any of those ‘religions’ are so blatantly false that it’s laughable yet there are millions of dumb Americans who believe what they’re told to believe. These people would be on average dumber than people of older religions, right?

Why is it today, we don't see miracles like those done during Jesus' day and before?  There were other men besides Jesus who claimed to be the Messiah and performed their own miracles.  There aren't any virgin births today as in the past.  No one has turned water to wine, parted the sea, or even levitated themselves the same as some Saints have.  What happened to all the miracles that were once common thousands of years ago?  Why can't we see them today??  Surely, if they were still being done today, they'd have been documented somewhere.

20090128130040AAupoEu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is Christianity just arrogant self-worship?	The common image of God is decidedly that of a human being. We equate Jesus with God, allowing us to worship a human figure instead of the amorphous Divine. The Sistine Chapel immortalized an image of God in a majestic, perfect human body.      We assume that God's mind works like ours, and that he thinks and feels the way we do. We assume that God can be angry like we feel anger, or sad, or loving, or that he wants us to follow a set of arbitrary rules.       Best of all, we name ourselves as the ultimate most important things in the entire universe, because God cares about us like we are his own children. There's an entire universe of fish, trees, bacteria, nebulae, and whole galaxies out there, yet we are infinitely more special than any of that. I have even heard people denouncing environmentalism as evil, because we are supposed to be masters of the earth, we shouldn't let it rule over us.      Remember that the line that everyone uses to try to back this up, "Made in His image," was written by a person with the exact mentality that I've just described.      The question: Is this world-view arrogant?
