I've always been told by ipod users and such that you cannot connect a mac formatted iPod to a pc. If so, you would have to restore it. PC iPods can work on macs, but not the other way around. So anyways, my iPod is formatted for mac. And I was moving to a house that used a pc. I backed up all my songs, because I knew if I wanted to connect it to a computer I would have to restore it to it's factory settings to use it  on windows. I get to the windows computer, connected my mac itouch thinking I would have to restore it,  but windows read my 2nd gen. iPod touch perfectly fine and I didn't have to erase 1700 something songs. If people say mac iPods don't work on A windows computer, why does mine? I was very lucky, but I want to know how it worked and why I didn't have to restore it. Has this happened to any of you? And if ibwere to connect it to a mac again, will I then have to restore it?

Is there something I can do to make sure that the song I'm downloading is an actual song and not a program that will hurt my computer?

20080731124549AAxpWDg	Computers & Internet;Security	Quer conhecer UM GRANDE TRUQUE para acabar com os VIRUS em seu computador ?	Esta recomenda??o, recentemente divulgada, é de um Director Técnico da HP, de uma grande multi nacional.       é um truque realmente engenhoso e de uma simplicidade gritante.    Quando um vírus entra no seu computador, ele se encaminha    directamente ao seu livro de endere?os, e envia-se para todos    os endere?os que ali encontra, infectando todos os seus contactos.    Ent?o, adopte a seguinte técnica:       1-Abra a sua agenda de contactos e fa?a um 'click' em 'novo contacto',    como se estivesse adicionando o e-mail de um amigo.       2-Na janela onde escreveria o nome do amigo, ponha 0000!(quatro zeros e    uma exclama??o - para ter certeza de que esse será o primeiro contacto   da sua lista, o que pode n?o ocorrer se você colocar letras ou n?o puser a exclama??o) .       3-Dê a ele o seguinte endere?o de e-mail:  alerta-virusmail@xyz.com       RESULTADO :    O seu 'amigo' 0000!, com o endere?o alerta-virusmail@xyz.com, será o    primeiro da sua agenda.    Portanto, será por ele que os vírus come?ar?o a se encaminhar a   todos os contactos    relacionados em ordem alfabética na sua agenda.    Mas é óbvio que será impossível ao sistema entregar a mensagem do   vírus no endere?o criado.    E, quando a primeira tentativa falha (coisa que se sucederá por causa da    falso endere?o), o vírus n?o continua a se propagar, e os seus verdadeiros amigos n?o   ser?o infectados.    Além disso, sabemos que à mensagem que n?o chega a um destinatário    corresponde um aviso ao emitente dando-lhe conta desse fato. E, por isso, você    receberá um aviso dizendo que sua mensagem para 0000!- com endere?o   alerta-virusmail@xyz.com    - n?o foi entregue... E você ficará sabendo que o seu computador TEM VíRUS .       Se todos nós usarmos este sistema t?o simples, os actuais vírus n?o    poder?o se propagar t?o facilmente e o número de computadores infectados   diminuirá drasticamente.    Pela facilidade de se fazer o procedimento acima,envie esta    mensagem para o maior números de amigos que puder para que    todos possam aprender e evitar os aborrecimentos actuais que    enfrentamos quando acessamos a Internet .      Fa?a isso!   LUZ!?
20090223015233AAWyQtZ	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What script for web page design would you use?	Ok low down,       Obviously im a first timer when it comes to designing a webpage otherwise i wouldnt be asking this, however i currently have "adobe dreamweaver" which is an excellent program. Been on a couple of sites  that have taught me enough and have 3 buddies that do this for a living, but i would like to attempt on my own first... But anyway       my choices are HTML, CSS, XML, JAVASCRIPT, ASP, PHP, SQL... and so on (don't say html cause its a good starter, i need a better reason)      My Site      I would like to start off as a page centered and fixed (to begin with)   Side buttons with separate pics with words within, change pic when highlighted (but when i get more creative would like them to animate, later on)      Thats what i would like, also the standard basics that follow with a webpage, words and such      Also im quite bright when it comes to computers and the lingo, this is just not my fortay yet...

20090223015532AAeJC9n	Computers & Internet;Internet;MSN	Hotmail error message - when you access your Windows Live Hotmail account from more than one computer...?	Hi there      Most mornings, but rarely at other times, I get an error message when using Hotmail via Internet Explorer.  It's not a pop up, but a yellow band across the screen above "sort by".  It says:      Please refresh your browser window. When you access your Windows Live Hotmail account from more than one computer, we ask you to sign in again to help keep your account private and secure.      I am not signed in on two computers and I always log out when I'm done.      My SUSPICION is that someone logs in on a morning to read my e-mails (I do have good reason to think this).  When I mentioned it to this person, the error messages mysteriously stopped for a week, which really made me wonder.      So my question is - can this error message mean anything OTHER than 'I' am logged in on two computers?      NB: I don't ever have to log in again or re-supply my password, you can 'click out' the error.      Thanks for any help.

I just got a new computer because my old one died, I installed my geforce 8500gt card, and it seemed like it would be okay, then my computer started stalling. I tried playing wow and the graphics messed up. My friend said it could be that the onboard videocard has to be disabled in the bios but it looks like in setup when i boot the computer, that it says default graphics is my pci-e and not my onboard card. What could it be and how do I get this running?? I'm no layman either, I'm just stumped.

20090223011104AA6LiNM	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Installed new laptop hard drive.  Need help with Partitions.?	While installing my new 250GB laptop hard drive I made a 25GB partition to use for the operating system and computer drivers/utilities.  Under disk Management it shows the 25GB as only 24.41GB labled (C:) and the rest of the drive 208.47GB as unallocated.        Questions:           1)  If I want all my other downloads to go to the unallocated space should I right click on it and make it a 208.47GB partition?  If so I would assume I would have to lable it another letter, but how to I designate which partition to save things in?  Maybe after there are 2 partitions it will ask me which to save in.        2) Will the computer know to use the (C:) partition as the primary?        3) Will my 208.47GB area that I want to save downloads like music in be called the "extended" partition?        4) If my brand new Western Digital Scorpio Blue 2.5" EIDE internal laptop hard drive claims it's 250GB why is it only showing 232.88 on my Disk Management page?  I know some space is used , but not 17.12GB.      Thanks for your help!!!

20090223012953AADObyR	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	C++ program help...have code.?	I am having some trouble on where to put the additional service charges and the dates.         For each transaction entered, the program should echo the transaction date, the current balance for the account, and the total service charges. Service charges are $0.10 for deposit and $0.15 for each check processed. If the balance drops below $300.00 at any point during the month, a service charge of $15.00 is assessed for the month. If the balance drops below $50, a warning message should be displayed. If the balance becomes negative, an additional service charge of $25 should be assessed for each check until the balance goes positive again!      a.      The input for the program should be:      1)      The initial balance (entered just once)      2)      Within a loop, a series of transactions. There are two kinds of transactions: deposit and check writing. Ask the user which type (d for deposit, w for withdrawl)      3)       Each transaction consists of a:                                                                                i.

Amount of deposit or the amount of the check      4)      Loop until the user indicates that there are no more transactions             b.      Make sure to echo all of the input – and make sure each value echoed has a meaningful label. Make sure to display all dollars and cents using proper format ($ sign and 2 digits after the decimal point)             c.       ERROR check! If the input is a negative number, display an error message and give the user another chance to enter the number             d.      ERROR check! If the input isn’t a ‘d’ or a ‘w’ when entering in the type of transaction, display an error message and give the user another chance to enter the choice.         #include     #include        using namespace std;      const double MINIMUM _BALANCE = 300.00;   const double SERVICE_CHARGE = 15.00;      int main ()   {                 double starting_balance;            double ending_balance;            double trans_amount;       double amountDeposited = 0.0;    int numberOfDeposits = 0;       double amountWithdrawn = 0.0;    int numberOfWithdrawals = 0;       char trans_type;      double trans_amount;       cout   starting_balance;    cout << "Enter the transaction type (D) Deposit or (W) withdrawal " ;       cout   trans_type;      cout   trans_amount;                       if (trans_type == 'D')       ending_balance = starting_balance + trans_amount;      else       ending_balance = starting_balance - trans_amount;                      cout << setiosflags (ios::fixed | ios::showpoint | ios::right)             << setprecision(2);      cout << endl;      cout << "Starting balance     $" << setw(8)               << starting_balance << endl;      cout << "Transaction          $" << setw(8)                  << trans_amount << setw(2) << trans_type << endl;    cout << setw(30) << "-------" << endl;      cout << "Ending  balance      $" << setw(8)                  << ending_balance << endl ;       return 0;   }
