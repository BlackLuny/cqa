20090202102102AAc8ijN	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Cleaning rug pad from wood floor - pls help!?	Hi,      After we removed a rug from our wood floor, the rug pad stuck to the floor.  It was a room with a southern exposure and it seems the pad got cooked on the floor, from the heat of th sun in that room.  The area is 8' x 10'.  We used a putty knife, but some areas were difficult to remove. We also used goo gone, but it's such a large area, the white material is still stuck.  We spent 3 hrs cleaning it, and now we have a sticky floor, with the goo gone stuff too.  We tried using an abrasive  sponge, and didn't work.            Any suggestions on how to clean this?  And also remove the slippery, oily stuff that Goo gone leaves behind?  Is there an easier way.            Many thanks!!

20060724224844AAN7GRZ	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Does anyone have some good tips to deal with neighbors?	There is a small concrete patio leading up to my front door that is shared with my neighbors.  It is written in the lease that this area is not to be used to store things, but it is constantly cluttered with bikes, scooters, chairs etc.  I have casually mentioned this to the managers several times and nothing has been done.  I cannot move because of my lease, but I also don't want to become the 'neighborhood whiner.'  It is like an obstacle course just to get to my front door, and I have an infant and a toddler to take with me whenever I leave.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I don't want to get in to a big confrontation with my neighbors...I've even gone out there and put everything away neatly hoping they would get the hint, but that didn't work.

20060726055951AAAjYmk	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Anyone know anythin' about European Hornets? Also known as Japanese Hornets?	Anyone know anythin' about European Hornets? Also known as Japanese Hornets? I live in NC. I am gettin' them in my house, I've checked and sealed my windows for cracks and openings, I make sure I don't leave doors open. I think I might have a nest within the walls of my house, as I do see them go in and out from behind the fuse box. I used get one in the house about every two weeks, now it's about two a week. I'm sure it has somethin' to do with the time of season.  I admit I'm scared of them and don't want to get stung or anyone else in my family .  It's amazin' how noisey they are when they are next to a window, which is when I've had a chance to kill them (can of spray) or else I'd never know they were in the house.  I'm thinkin' sprayin' all that crap in the house obviously can't be good either and yes I'm lookin' into pest control, not much help so far. Help!!  Thanks
