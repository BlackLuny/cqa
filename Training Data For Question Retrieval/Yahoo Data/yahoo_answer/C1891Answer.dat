nZo6EdZxaa	To Do that You need to have the "Format" Bar, below your menu.<br>  <br>  Right click at any button you have enabled below your menu, and make sure that "Formatting" is check marked<br>  <br>  once you have the "Formatting" bar enabled, you notice that there are two buttons with a Paragraph symbol - one with a triangle pointing at the paragraph symbol at the FRONT of the Symbol, if you highlight it with your mouse it should read "Left To right Direction", the one next to it is also pointing at the Paragraph symol from BEHIND. if you highlight that button with your mouse, it should read "Right to left". That's what you want. Click that Button, and it should change the writing orientation of the page, and you can Bullet list the other way around from Right to left!.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

I don't know if it is worth it for you, but I chose the 2.4 GHz model.  I needed the extra HD space (which you can upgrade on either model) and I really like the backlit keyboard (even more than I thought I would).  For normal purposes, you won't notice any difference in the speed of the processor, so it basically comes down to the HD and the keyboard.

For example, type in glass breaking sound effect in the search box and many different downloads will pop up in the right side of the window. Double click on it to download it, and if you would like to sample it before you download it all, right click on the download in the 3rd section (which pops up when you double click) and click pause and then right click, once again, and select preview. It will allow you to preview the song as far as it has downloaded. You can get just about anything off of Limewire or Frostwire, all for free. And with similar programs like BearShare and Kaazaa. Be careful though, some files may contain viruses and be especially cautious if you do not have virus protection. <br>  <br>  Anyways here are some links to download a file-sharing program if you don't already have one:<br>  <br>  Limewire - www.limewire.com<br>  Frostwire - www.frostwire.com<br>  BearShare - www.bearshare.com<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want more selection here is a whole list of safe programs:<br>  <a href="http://www.filehippo.com/software/p2p/" rel="nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/software/p2p/</a>

t5sYXwSqaa	They as designed to be left on all the time but my advice would be to switch it off when you do not need to use it. I say this for three reason;<br>  <br>  1) Whilst off there is absolutely no chance of anybody getting into your system or trying to crack you security.<br>  2) You are wasting powered by leaving it on.<br>  3) Some routers are prone to overheating and leaving them on can lead to problems accessing the internet etc<br>  <br>  You will do no harm switching it off. I only have mine on as necessary<br>  <br>  There is probably a wireless conflict with nearby wireless routers. You need to be able to get into the router settings. You normally do this by typing an address into the internet explorer address bar an example would be <a href="http://192.168.1.1" rel="nofollow">http://192.168.1.1</a> but this address depends on your router. Go to advanced setup, wireless settings, and find the place where it says broadcast channel or similar. if it is set to auto choose one of the settings from the list, any of them (from 1 to 11) if it is already at 1 to 11 try a setting at the opposite scale. Eg if it was at 2 set it at 10. If it doesn't work then just put it back or try another number. People using the same channel in a close area will have problem with disconnection as it will yo-yo between your system and theirs. Hope this helps.|`|MxculX2Daa	Leave it on if you are likely to use it.<br>  Switch it off at times when you are not likely to use it (like when you are out at work or in bed)<br>  <br>  It will automatically re-connect with all the same settings within about 15 seconds of turning it on.|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	Most folks leave these on all the time.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

i9PhENN6aa	One of the music files in your library could be corrupt or be a virus. I'd check it using a good antivirus solution like Norton 2009 or superantispyware. <br>  <br>  You could also reinstall iTunes to make sure your running the latest version. many times the software has buges it in that get repaired over time.|`|JUC8E03taa	I'd uninstall iTunes and then download the latest version from the website and install that. It sounds like something has become corrupted, uninstalling and re-installing should take care of that problem. You don't have to worry about losing any of your music since the music files are stored on your computer separately from iTunes - iTunes just keeps track of where they are and provides an easy way to access them.
qgCwy4Pgaa	Could be because you have a virus/bloatware on your PC. Highly erratic behaviour/undesirable operation can be due to that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Contact a computer technician to assist you asap. If your grades depend on it, go the distance to get it fixed. In the meantime, uninstall everything on your pc that you don't need. If necessary, get a new PC. Don't let a machine control your life.<br>  <br>  Pro-tip: Save your work often. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

IFtV7g2Zaa	Bad news.  Its probably the drive, unless you have a habit (like me) of opening the case periodically and moving stuff in and out.  Cables are amazing little beasts.  They have no moving parts and unless there is some flaw in it, then its rare that a cable will stop working before the drive its connected to.  I have a whole drawer full of various cables from various computers that outlived the computers they came from.<br>  <br>  Now, with that said, first thing to try before the panic sets in: shutdown the computer, disconnect all the cables from the SATA drive, and reconnect them.  Make sure that they are seated properly.  Disconnect the SATA data cable from the motherboard, and then reconnect, making sure its seated properly.<br>  <br>  Boot the computer.  Working?  Yes? Whew!!  No?  Dead hard drive.<br>  <br>  Windows is notorious for not booting when it cannot recognize one of the hard drives.  Leave it sit for up to 30 minutes at the initial (just turned on) screen.  The detection processes will time out and it may boot.  You can also try changing the detect from Auto to User and set the drive parameters yourself.  This will prevent the auto-detection on that drive.  In any case, this is a sign that your hard drive is dying.  You've been living on borrowed time, for that drive.<br>  <br>  Hard drive dead?  Put it in the freezer overnight.  Go buy a new hard drive and an external case.  Put the new hard drive into the computer and the frozen hard drive into the external case.  Plug the frozen drive into the USB port and copy the data to the new hard drive.  As long as the drive stays cold, you MIGHT be able to get your files off.  When it starts to warm up, it will likely die again.<br>  <br>  For the new drive, stay away from Maxtor.  Their specs are similar to other drives, and they're cheaper for similar specs, but Maxtor drives are really slow when copying or moving small files.  Seagate is probably among the best right now.  I've got 3 Seagate drives in a server that's been running 24/7 for 11 years, and Seagate drives in other computers.  IBM drives used to be good, before Hitachi bought the division.  Western Digitals are still great!

It all depends on what you are doing in your browser.<br>  <br>  In general though, browsers don't take up nearly as much memory as a game. You should probably focus more on the functions and interface of a browser to find one you like best, than it's memory usage.

But since you get a get a new card for around $50 I'd go with that. You can also just use your onboard sound.<br>  <br>  BTW Vista has come along way, I use Vista 64 on my personal machine, since they released SP1, it's much, much more reliable, and if you have a halfway decent machine ( Dual core CPU, 2 gigs of RAM, and a halfway decent video card), it's plenty fast.

UMGZErwhaa	This is normal. Basically the status you see is the LAN interface, which failed to acquire an IP address.

The problem of speed could be because of any other reason.|`|xW8p9YEHaa	Hi<br>  This is not a LAN problem.<br>  I think you are using Windows Vista or Windows 7 because during install  Windows Vista and Seven ask about setting up - Home  or Office (Work) Network.<br>  Mostly we skip this as we do not have any Office or Home Network.But both OS create Default LAN(Local Area Network) So,the LAN message: "STATUS: limited or no connectivity or Local Access Only " appears which shows that there is no LAN i.e. Home Network connection.<br>  <br>  To use Broadband we CREATE a new  PPPoE connection which is different from default LAN(Home or Office Network) created by OS.So you can still access Internet in spite of the LAN message.<br>  <br>  In short,you have two different connections independent of each other.<br>  <br>  Regarding Download speed you have not mentioned your connection Speed like 256Kbps or Higher and the download speed you get.So It will not be possible to point out the reason,but it is sure that LAN message has nothing to do with Download Speed.<br>  <br>  Here are few tips for full speed download:<br>  1.Use Downloader like Obit or DAP. Also check your firewall settings.<br>  <br>  2.If you download using uTorrent ot BitComet then Limit Upload Rate to 1 and Download rate to Unlimited.<br>  <br>  Try these tips.Hope your question is solved now.<br>  <br>  Have a great time dear,<br>  <br>  Er.Guru

azHNvwjeaa	at a quick glance, the first thing i notice is that in your form, the first variable is called "Name:" ... it's possible PHP/server is not liking the colon ... or just the fact that $ Name has no value because the form calls it $ Name : (with the colon)!<br>  <br>  if that's not the problem, display the $ email_to, $ email_subject, etc variables before the mail ( )  to make sure you've got valid data ... will help you find out WHERE it's failing at least<br>  <br>  what's the result of the if ( $ sent ) ?  does it think it sent it?<br>  <br>  EDIT:  As a side note, I see a concern here with the fact that you're passing the $ email_to value to a sendmail script.  Sounds like an open invitation to spammers to use your sendmail script for sending out spam, with YOUR server/host getting the blame.  Just a warning...<br>  <br>  EDIT # 2: Now that I see you're getting 'page not found' after submit, it appears you have no sendmail php file, or not in right location or right permissions.  Everything after the second < ? php  in your listing should be in sendmail . php<br>  <br>  EDIT # 3: And that first block of php code should not be there.  the form should just submit the field values to sendmail . php, which is your SECOND block of php code. The first block of php code, if it's included in the same file as the form, will try to send the email every time the page is loaded, but without any values for the variables.<br>  <br>  Remove everything after the first < ? php from the file that creates the form.  Put everything after the SECOND < ? php into a file named sendmail . php and make sure it has the correct permissions.<br>  <br>  Edit # 4:  Peter K brings up a valid point. IIS usually does NOT have PHP (but CAN have with a little extra work), whereas *NIX usually DOES have it by default.  But even with that, if the sendmail . php file existed (with proper permissions), it should attempt to display the php code not 'page not found' error.  What did the helpdesk say?  If they talked about php code, they should have it installed.  At least, that was my ASSumption -- and yes, I know what they say about assumptions...  (Last edit.  I'm going to lunch now...)  Good luck.|`|f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	It isn't likely to work. Nobody else seems to have spotted the problem. Your server does not support PHP. Your webserver is Microsoft IIS and unless somebody has done some magic ferkling it won't have PHP installed. Most ISPs will not let you manage your server to that level. But if yours is run by a web guru then ask them to install PHP. Or you can find a similar form that uses ASP instead which Microsoft IIS always supports.|`|by9b94M4aa	I have tried your enquiry form and the page <a href="http://www.hairbykirbyblythe.co.uk/sendmail.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairbykirbyblythe.co.uk/sendm...</a> cannot be found.<br>  <br>  I use FormMail.cgi myself and through my experience I have found that if the name of the script is not spelt right - even to the casing of the letter, you will get a 'Page Not Found' error. So 'Sendmail.php' and 'sendmail.php' are totally different. Check this out first. The script looks OK compared with what i know of PHP scripts.<br>  <br>  Also you need to give these scripts the right read, write permissions when you upload to your server.

It's now even better integrated with the other Adobe products in Creative Suite 4. It's fairly easy to learn for basic things, but can do very advanced stuff as you grow.

d6WMmjn7aa	WPA would be attacked first if the cracker was sitting outside your house. The whole point of WPA is to prevent everyday people from free loading off your wifi or scriptkiddies from intercepting that online banking information that I hope you're not sending over the internet. WPA is not hack proof, from what I understand it's crackable just like WEP, but it takes a little bit more time. Without sounding grim, if someone wanted to crack your computer who was good enough, they would be able to.

hdTJ5Lpnaa	Don't use more then one anti virus.<br>  m|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	As you can see, "antivirus" software doesn't really prevent malware from infecting your computer.<br>  <br>  Now that you have a virus, the best thing you can do to remove it is reinstall Windows.<br>  <br>  Once you've done that you can protect your computer by following these steps:<br>  <br>  <br>  1. Use a limited user account.<br>  <br>  2. Google "social engineering" and read the first five results and take them to heart<br>  <br>  3. Don't pirate software, music, videos<br>  <br>  4.

They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from <a href="http://www.download.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/</a> I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site. It is safe to use two anti-spy products but never use more than one A/V as it can cause conflicts. You should run A/V and anti spy weekly.

Turn off the printer and wait 10 seconds. Turn it on again<br>  <br>  2. Let the printer print the test page.<br>  <br>  3. After the test page is printed, disconnect the USB cable connecting the printer to your computer. DO NOT turn off the printer while disconnecting the USB cable.<br>  <br>  4. Place the test page on the scanner glass and press the SCAN button on the printer. The ON light will flash as the page is being scanned. <br>  <br>  5. Remove the test page when the ON light is steady.<br>  <br>  6. Finally, turn off the printer and wait another 10 seconds. Then turn it on again. No more printing test pages! Yay!<br>   <br>  (You may now reconnect the printer to your computer via the USB cable.)|`|AA12181625	it would help to know what brand printer . like hp , or if it is a pcs , ... it ask these things so when you do a job with it it will not be crooked or half on the page and off too.|`|7pAXElgSaa	yes you did! you aligned the cartridge! the printer does this by itself when ever you change cartridges! it set the cartridge so the<br>  ink flows properly, the head is straight and flat with the paper, and your text will form a srtaight line when printing The print out shows how the print is "alined" and that all is well! It also "cleans" the new print head. Not somthing you should worry about just let the machine do its thing, you'll be fine.

I am one of them.|`|8f550f3060c36d87c828fa62f0dd0540aa	SPAM is not good! Most people doesn't care these types of mail. I am one of them.<br>  <br>  The better way to advertise is advertise by web, such as Google AdSense.<br>  <br>  Why did your mail go to the spam folder?<br>  ======================================...<br>  1. The computer reads your e-mail and thought it was spammy, so the mail service puts it into the SPAM folder.<br>  2. No e-mail service identifier, this makes the e-mail service provider knows that the mail was sent by a real person, not spammers.<br>  3. No headers. Most spammers doesn't send the header.

If that's the case, the battery could be fine, but no current is making it TO the battery in order to recharge it.  This is highly unlikely to happen, though.<br>  <br>  I would say you can safely assume that it is simply time to get yourself a new battery!|`|EK8Wx5qZaa	Hi,<br>  Just to make sure, try another battery to see how it works.<br>  If a new one is ok then you need to change your battery.<br>  Is definetly something wrong with the battery!<br>  Cheers!|`|wA57jCsjaa	You are absolutely correct in most cases it is the battery that needs to be replaced this just happened to my aunt as a matter of fact.|`|FhWOpW4waa	You need a new battery.

If you are looking for the advanced version of Limewire I do believe it costs. The basic version works pretty much the same way. My advice is be very careful and make sure if you decide to use Limewire to have a great antivirus such as Norton, McAffe,etc.

elgVgRCRaa	I fix laptops for people all the time at Kent State University. I have to say that the laptops with the best quality and longevity is an Apple. Mac does not get viruses like Windows so there is no need to buy Norton or any other virus protection. The build quality is amazing as well. You will notice that the Operating System is much smoother and more reliable. Rarely does it crash or need a reboot. You can install Windows if you must through boot-camp to game with it. There is Microsoft Office for Mac also so no worries.<br>  <br>  Connecting the Mac on campus will be easier for you and the people like me that have to help freshman with the network. On campuses they require you to have their anti-virus and CCA (Cisco Clean Access) which makes sure that your computer is up to date. This prevents viruses on the network. Macs don't need to install any of this. Plug it in and it works. Basically the Windows kids will have slow computers and will be jumping through hoops to get onine and yours will just work.<br>  <br>  Unlike Windows you don't need tons of RAM because the OS is very light and fast. It runs a UNIX core. This means that unlike Vista you can run Leopard at fast speeds using 1GB RAM. The OS handles up to 8GB currently and supports 64bit. This is much better than the Vista 64bit or 32bit because it is strictly one or the other. Leopard has 64bit and 32bit compatibility in one OS. With Windows Vista 32bit only handles up to 4GB memory space. Put in 4GB of RAM and the OS only sees 3.4 or so.<br>  <br>  I have owned Macs for years and love mine.

IFtV7g2Zaa	Once upon a time, your idea of one process at a time was accurate.  Its not any more.  Today, its not entirely accurate.  Multiple processors means multiple processes.  If you've got a PC with two physical quad core processors, then you essentially have 8 processors.  So, instead of only doing one thing at a time, at any one instance (and time slicing so every process gets a turn), now you've got 8 processes that can be front and center at any one time.  Further, and I'm not a hardware guy, I believe that the typical CPU does a much better job at time slicing today than they did 10 years ago.  So, it can appear that all processes get more CPU time and thus are running simultaneously.  Threaded applications have gone a long way to make this a reality.<br>  <br>  More processors requires more memory too.  If you need 2Gb for efficient operation of 1 processor, the you'll need 16Gb for efficient operation of 8 processors.  And then things get interesting, since 32bit computers can only address up to 4Gb of RAM.<br>  <br>  The task manager, performance tab, does an excellent job of showing you the basic information about how your computer is performing.  But for more detailed information, read up on the Performance Monitor.  The Performance Monitor is an mmc snap-in.  On Vista its called Reliability and Performance.  Using that tool, you can watch all the details of your CPUs functionality.  (And its included with Windows).<br>  <br>  Benchmarks are another way of assessing your CPU.  But keep in mind, a benchmark is only an indication of how fast or how slow it could be.  Not how fast it will be under the load of all of your applications.|`|PNiHwVgNaa	Just go to your windows task manager and click on Performance.It will give you all details about your CPU usage.<br>  It will not be very informative,but I told you what I knew.Forgive me!|`|IXFIC1fEaa	Ctrl + Alt + Delete<br>  <br>  Down after the list...<br>  <br>  CPU usage in %

AA10683869	When purchasing a projector it will always depend on the application that you desire, is it for business, is it for personal use, do you need it to be mobile, etc.  <br>  For quality I recommend not buying anything but DLP or better, the new technology is important.  You also will want it to have the capability of at least a screen resolution of native 1024X768 because today nothing is in 800X600 that is just poor resolution.  Also get a contrast ration of 2000:1 or better and recommend lumens at least 2000 in operation mode and 1700 in low power mode.  Also make sure that you consider the room that you will be using the most, because if the room is big and you get one with a small throw ratio you will not be able to send the picture to a big enough size, most throw up to 300" and have can do that within 10 feet. hope this helps.

You need to consider what you are using it for and where you are going to be using it. If it's for your own use at home, then portability will not be that important. If it's used in a boardroom, then more resolution and quality would win over portability. For folks like "Burnem: and me, portability is important. I want something compact and light weight, easy to set up and pack up, good adjustability in the focus department, and long cables. My biggest beef with all the projector manufacturers is the crappy little plasticleg they put on the front (it always seems to break) and the poor to no leveling capability. At the price they want for this things, you;d thnk they could come up with something a little more robust. Another consideration is the cost of replacement lamps. Some are very expensive and sone not so much.

The link below describes the processor...<br>  <br>  It is a dual core single chip processor...<br>  <br>  You should typically wait 8 to 12 hours on the first charge...

If this is the case there are alot of reasons why this could be so,<br>   Firstly you must have a program to  broadcast, you didn't mention any, so I don't know what you are using. Open this program,( If you don't know what i'm talking about , then I think we found the problem ) start your camera ,then open windows media player or winamp and click on "file" > "open url" and type in "http://localhost you should be able to see from your web cam, if you don't recheck the setup procedures you did for whatever program you are using to broadcast.<br>  <br>    Your computer and web cam must be on when you try to access them from outside. If your camera is turned off there will be no feed, so check your power settings,screen savers, auto power off etc.<br>    Check your firewall settings to make sure that it's not blocking you. <br>  <br>    If your IP address is dynamic (most likely) you will  have trouble broadcasting. You can go to no-ip.com and get some more information on how they can help. <br>  <br>   What is your upload speed? If every thing else is ok, then most likely your connection is too slow to upload video to the internet.<br>    I tried using camstream encoder(to broad cast) with a no-ip account (to maintain a fixed IP address) but in the end after all of this my "broadband" connection was too slow (256k down 64k up ). <br>    If you can use the camera it isn't neccassary to install the camera's software (but it is reccommended)<br>    This isn't a complete check list, It is just to give an idea as to where you can start looking for a solution.

64b458dc74ea429f7b0d9b794715dd0daa	While your software may be telling you that you have a strong signal, in fact it may well be lying. WiFi has it's limitations and the more walls or floors you put between you and your WiFi router, the more problems you are going to encounter. <br>  <br>  I have friends who can't get their WiFi signal emanating from the router in their basement office to transmit to the second story of their house. This is not uncommon. In their case, I recommended they pull a CAT V cable up through the cold air return from the basement to the second story and hang a second WiFi router off it. <br>  <br>  Rule #1 of WiFi is its "line of sight", meaning if you can't "see" the router, neither can your PC/laptop. Reflection and dispersion will help you some, just like with your cell phone or FM radio, but in the end "no see = no signal"|`|AA11386744	Are you talking about Wireless Signal??<br>  <br>  Facts about Boardband.  You are on a hub (at the broadbands' office) and share your connection with four or five other people.  If one or more of these "shared" users are downloading Music, Movies or other big files, your speed will drop.<br>  <br>  If you do have a wireless device, and it is in a different area of the house, you can loose speed or signal due to interference from other electrical devices and wall composition.  And, most notably from certain Wireless Phones (not cell phones).  Wireless devices could show you have a strong connection, but it really doesn't show if your connection to the Internet is strong... just strong to the wireless device.<br>  <br>  It really depends on how far you are from the prime wireless device, and whether you are using B, G or N wireless.  B & G wireless do well if the spaces are short, but not as well if you are further away.  N (the new standard) is a bit stronger and reaches a bit further.

AA12314434	I've been selling on ebay for a little over 2 years and I still remember how hard it was just starting out.

They'll walk you through it all.  It's very easy to follow along.  Watch for selling by auction - sometimes you get more for an auction than by Buy It Now.|`|d971cf29d34d0036f40a626419666e03aa	Add the buy it now option when prompted on Ebay. You will initially be prompted to sell at a fixed price or at an auction price. If you select auction price you can still include a buy it now price. I have got a higher price than my buy it now price by setting it up as an auction price instead of a fixed price, so I recommend that way.

9c93bfd6fdcaa2231fe832dc19a35a66aa	the best one I can suggest is the free anti virus and the anti spyware from <a href="http://free.grisoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://free.grisoft.com</a>|`|b92ed6ec66e5f947f15f4122686a6bc0aa	Here's some ideas to "roll ya own" Internet Security Suite for free. Free is always the best.<br>  <br>  1. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V)<br>  <br>  I like the AOL AntiVirusShield. Don't let the name AOL scare you. AntiVirusShield is made by Kaspersky which is one of top-rated anti-virus vendors in the world.<br>  <br>  In recent tests, the most popular free anti-virus, AVG, was only able to detect about 82% of a very large sample of viruses. On the other hand, AntiVirusShield was able to detect better than 99% in the same test.<br>  Full test results are here:<br>  <a href="http://www.virus.gr/english/fullxml/default.asp?id=82&mnu=82" rel="nofollow">http://www.virus.gr/english/fullxml/defa...</a> <br>  <br>  AntiVirusShield has excellent virus detection rates and is extremely light on using your computer resources.<br>  <br>  Updates many times per day to detect new malware.<br>  <br>  Free to anyone, AOL member or not from:<br>  <a href="http://www.activevirusshield.com/antivirus/freeav/index.adp?" rel="nofollow">http://www.activevirusshield.com/antivir...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  2. For your Firewall..........(Always use only 1 firewall)<br>  <br>  An excellent free firewall is Comodo Personal Firewall. It can pass firewall "leak tests" that even most of the "paid-for" firewalls cannot pass.<br>  <br>  And Comodo has a great support forum. Where the CEO / President of the company might even himself answer your question! Check it out at:<br>  <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  3. For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...............(use 2)<br>  <br>  Pick and choose, 2 anti-spywares from the list below and alternate scanning with them on a regular basis. New spywares are created literally hourly, so no single anti-spyware can really detect all malware. Have at least 2 on hand and alternate scanning with each every few days or so. All are free. All can remove as well as detect.<br>  <br>  Spybot Search and Destroy:<br>  <a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybotsd/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.safer-networking.org/en/spybo...</a><br>  <br>  Ewido:<br>  <a href="http://www.ewido.net/en/download/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ewido.net/en/download/</a><br>  <br>  Adaware SE:<br>  <a href="http://www.lavasoft.de/software/adaware/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lavasoft.de/software/adaware/</a><br>  <br>  A-Squared:<br>  <a href="http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/free/" rel="nofollow">http://www.emsisoft.com/en/software/free...</a><br>  <br>  SUPERAntiSpyware:<br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br>  <br>  Windows Defender:<br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security/spyware/software/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/security...</a><br>  <br>  Unfortunately, many "paid for" anti-spyware products are in fact either of limited usefulness or downright scams.

In fact, its probably better to divesify in order to protect your PC.  You should, at minimum, have a virus scanner and an anti-spyware scanner.  <br>  <br>  I use AVG for anti-virus and XoftspySE for spyware protection.

KYPuj0Nsaa	LightScribe is an optical disc recording technology that utilizes specially coated recordable CD and DVD media to produce laser-etched labels.<br>  <br>  The purpose of LightScribe is to allow users to create direct-to-disc labels (as opposed to stick-on labels), using their optical disc writer. Special discs and a compatible disc writer are required. After burning data to the read-side of the disc, the user simply turns the media over and inserts it with the label side down.

Und auch der Versandt ist sehr billig...<br>  Achja, und Windoof kannst du, musst du aber nicht kaufen...<br>  Es geht also so oder so, ganz wie der Kunde es wünscht.

Both are free and safe to use.<br>  <br>  Spybot - Search & Destroy detects and removes spyware, a relatively new kind of threat not yet covered by common anti-virus applications. Spyware silently tracks your surfing behaviour to create a marketing profile for you that is transmitted without your knowledge to the compilers and sold to advertising companies. If you see new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you haven't intentionally installed, if your browser crashes inexplicably, or if your home page has been "hijacked" (or changed without your knowledge), your computer is most probably infected with spyware. Even if you don't see the symptoms, your computer may be infected, because more and more spyware is emerging.

Rc2DDuGdaa	Das hat wohl weniger mit XP noch sonst irgendetwas damit zu tun. Ich selbst benutze eine solche WLAN Box oder Router.<br>  Auch bei mir gehen die Seiten manchmal nicht.<br>  Das liegt aber wohl kaum an den Einstellungen von dem Browser, was soll man da schon einstellen? Es gibt doch kein H?kchen: Seiten nicht aufbauen    oder so etwas. Wenn dann liegt es daran, dass der Router nicht richtig konfiguriert wurde. Denn wenn der Router nicht direkt mit dem Computer verbunden ist, sonder über einen WLAN USB Stick erst noch, dann müssen die Einstellungen gleich sein, wird ja bei Dir wahrscheinlich auch so sein, wenn nur ein paar Seiten nicht gehen.<br>  Das kann aber auch am Anbieter (DSL?) liegen, z.B. ging bei mir einmal das Internet zwei Tage lang nicht, und danach dann schon.<br>  Und der Browser ist am wenigsten beteiligt, denn ich glaube, wenn die Seite mit dem IE nicht aufrufbar ist, ist es mit Firefox oder Opera genauso.<br>  Eine L?sung w?re, dass Du auf <br>  Extras>Internetoptionen und dann auf Dateien und Cookies l?schen gehst (optional).<br>  Meist hilft das aber nur bei der Geschwindigkeit, also um sie etwas zu erh?hen, da weniger Dateien geladen werden müssen.<br>  Wenn die Seiten nach l?ngerem Gebrauch des PC's nicht aufgebaut werden, hilft es oft, den Computer neu zu starten oder herunterzufahren.<br>  Dann wird das Netzwerk noch einmal neu geladen, bei mir hilft es meistens.<br>  Oft kommt man auch über google zu den Seiten, wenn man sie unter Suche eingibt, geht aber auch nur manchmal.<br>  Aber im Gro?en und Ganzen gesagt:<br>  Diesen Fehler kannst Du im Normalfall nicht beheben, es sei denn, die Seite l?dt zu einem anderen Zeitpunkt noch.<br>  Meistens ist nur der Server überlastet, v.a. abends.<br>  <br>  Wahrscheinlich hilft Dir das nicht viel weiter, aber ich hoffe, wenigstens ein bisschen.|`|9369bfdbd9af2a33f4ee222cd8c2e5e3aa	Hatte das gleiche Problem, wie Du es beschreibst.

Ein Server kann ausfallen und, bevor der Fehler behoben wurde vegeht ne Weile. Manchmal kann man halt verzweifeln denn, man hat nichts getan, nichts eingestellt oder so und, dann kommt einem dass www bl?de. <br>  Es w?re hilfreich wenn du sagst, wie du ins Web gehst.

His testing method is a lot better than some websites where they see that the power supply looks pretty so it must be good.

Our office has had great luck with Dell desktop PCs. With kids, give thought about what if the screen goes. The boss at work damaged his and a repair shop charged a pretty penny to repair it. Even if you buy the part yourself and install it, it is expensive.

Z9b6uUMaaa	Hallo,<br>  <br>  um unterwegs in das Internet gehen zu k?nnen brauchst du erstmal eine WLan Karte. Wahrscheinlich hat dein Notebook eine Pcmcia Schnittstelle oder einen USB Anschluss. <br>  <br>  Dafür ben?tigst du die passende W-Lan Karte. Für USB findest du z.b. hier: <a href="http://www.preissuchmaschine.de/psm_frontend/main.asp?kid=3-288" rel="nofollow">http://www.preissuchmaschine.de/psm_fron...</a> eine Auswahl.<br>  <br>  Für Pcmcia hier: <a href="http://www.preisroboter.de/ergebnis834105.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.preisroboter.de/ergebnis83410...</a><br>  <br>  Kosten zwischen 15-xxx€<br>  <br>  Dann brauchst du noch einen drahtlosen Zugangspunkt (Hotspot) mit dem du dich verbinden kannst.<br>  <br>  Das kann ein verschlüsselter Zugangspunkt sein, dann brauchst du die Zugangsdaten dazu. Die Preise variieren da stark.<br>  <br>  Oder du findest einen unverschlüsselten Zugangspunkt, mit dem du dich über die Netzwerkkarte einw?hlen kannst, das kostet dann für dich nichts.<br>  <br>  Um einen Hotspot in deiner N?he zu finden gibt es spezielle Anbieter wie die hier:<br>  <a href="http://www.hotspot-locations.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hotspot-locations.de/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.t-online.de/hotspot/website/" rel="nofollow">http://www.t-online.de/hotspot/website/</a><br>  <br>  Cafees mit kostenlosem Zugang kannst du hier finden: <a href="http://www.cafespots.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cafespots.de/</a><br>  <br>  Ein ganz nettes Projekt, in dem sich die Personen die mitmachen überall kostenlos ins Internet einw?hlen k?nnen findest du hier: <a href="http://www.fon.com/de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fon.com/de/</a>|`|AMQyIi2Zaa	Also ich hab Wlan und bei manchen Kaffees gibt es internet umsonst.

Of course, most home WAP's don't support it at this time.  The best you can probably achieve is WPA-PSK.<br>  <br>  If at all possible, avoid doing WEP unless that's the highest your router will go.

a17f26f68534b9b1f0f9a743c50e798daa	You can easily tell the difference between what you want to download and what is a virus... for example if you are looking for a song called.. Blue.. and the search results are like Britany blue spears, u know its either a virus or spam..<br>  hope i helped|`|6ae785d517f772ee85b2d110a59e3e46aa	Hello Guy P,  To answer your question above, on a scale between 1 and 10...it would always be 10.  The truth is, no matter what virus software you have on your computer, you will never have complete protection from virus's or malacious software.  Everyday Virus's are created, and virus creators are always trying to create the "perfect" virus that can get by your Virus software.  True, having a good Anti-Virus program is a must and Trendmicro has a good rating.. However, no matter what you download, there will always be the possibility of downloading a virus.  I know that P2P (peer to peer) file sharing programs are a Virus's favorite way to spread, but that is due to their creator's.  I also enjoy using LimeWire, and "knock on wood" I have as of yet downloaded a virus..       I do have a couple of tips when downloading not only from LimeWire but any other P2P program:  <br>  <br>  1.  When searching for songs, do not download a song that has a file size of 1MB or lower...or a file size of 5MB or over..These are mostly likely to contain virus's or malacious software.  <br>  <br>  2.  Don't download a song or file that contains any other words or symbols in its title.  For example, if you search for "Broken Road" by Rascal Flatts... Do not download the song if the title says "Rascal Flatts - Broken Road$.zip.exe"<br>  <br>  And no matter what Anti-virus software you choose to use, always keep it up-to-date! And in addition to using Anti-Virus software, download Anti-Spyware software as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|6hCTHdGjaa	7-8 i always get one anbd have to start all over|`|JUbevQJhaa	I have had and used Limewire on my computer for about a year and a half now and I have NEVER had a virus and I just have plain old Norton Anti Virus on my computer and I DL a LOT of music so if I was going to get one I would have gotten one by now I'm pretty sure! <br>  I just went to my Limewire library of songs I've downloaded and I've DL <br>  38, 692 songs in total so if THAT doesn't tell you I don't know what will!|`|WmfnOH7kaa	Depends what you download.<br>  <br>  On the whole though, dodgy files are fairly easy to spot so as long as you stick to files with an .mp3 extention you should be ok
XanSl356aa	Ok this is only if ads are popping up during your internet experience cos maybe i have a good AV or something but i havent heard of ads popping up during an offline venture.<br>  <br>  a)Start using Firefox(<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/)</a><br>   , that,ll be one of he best things you can do :D,<br>  Install an Add-On called No-script(<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/722)" rel="nofollow">https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...</a><br>  <br>  From then on whenever you visit a website which runs script(these are the ones which cause all those non-required ads and pop-ups and a few flash).<br>  On the bottom right corner ull see an S with a cross over it ,click on it and allow only the main website to run scripts ,<br>  for eg,(in yahoo allow only yahoo.com,and yimg.com) to run scripts and nothing else.<br>  <br>  b)if the trouble exits when ur offline , once any ad pops up hold down ctrl+alt+del,and check which processess are running,if any process resembles the popup or is suspecious , then note down that .exe name run a search and delete that file :D.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

If your computer is sending an error message to Microsoft, there is something wrong with the installation of your copy of Word. Either the program is illegal, in which case it will notify Microsoft, or you are trying to get it to perform an action that it can't perform. You need to be more specific.|`|XanSl356aa	The setup of your program has been corrupted,Un-install the software and re-install it . This should solve your problems.|`|ewvfRSkoaa	You may need to re-install the Word.  First try repairing it. Go to the Control Panel.  Click on add or remove programs. It may take a minute or two to compile the list of programs depending on how many different programs you have installed on your computer.Click on Microsoft Word (or Microsoft Office if you have the full Package).  That Item will expand and show a link that says click here for support.  A window opens that shows the link to the Microsoft support website, the version of the software, the product ID and registration information.  In the bottom right corner is a button that says "repair".  Click the button and follow the instructions.  Be  aware that you will probably need the installation CD to do this, so have it handy.<br>  <br>  Also, you don't use a "text box" to insert a photo in a Word document.  Click Insert on the tool bar menu, then picture, then from file.  This generally opens up My pictures, but you can go to any picture file on your computer. Highlight the file in your list then click insert.  If it is a high resolution picture it could take a minute to transfer in.  You may also want to edit the picture with  your photo software and shrink or crop it to a smaller size and save the copy with a different name for inserting in documents.

dfjIBHe3aa	If you installed it over Windows it's not only gone but you NUKED those files.  The former head of Computer Associates went to jail for installing OpenSuse on a Windows laptop which had been subpoenaed -- i.e., Forensics couldn't get those files back.  Ubuntu tries to keep it simple for people so it isn't always as explicit as it can be, but you wrote an ext2 file system over what had formerly been an NTFS system, and it did a very thorough job so NOT EVEN fragments of your files are left.  If you wanted to save your files with Linux the way would have been to use a live cd like Knoppix or System Rescue CD.  You didn't and it sounds like you should just give up.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	It will not be the C: drive as such. Open a command prompt (console)<br>  Type in df and enter.

Apart from that it should list them and show you the NTFS or FAT32 partition and where it is mounted.|`|CKE9oLlZaa	You have to set up a separate partition by shrinking your C drive in windows and creating a second partition in the space before installing ubuntu into that new partition. If you just installed then not formatting will have made no difference. You simply installed over the top of the windows install.<br>  If you did make a second partition but can't boot to it you need to reinstall the bootloader or 'repair' bootloader - I forget which one it is on Ubuntu but you get the option with the install CD/DVD and it doesn't involve re-installing Ubuntu so its a five minute job.<br>  The bootloader is installed on hd0,0 (or whatever it is on yours) the point being you don't install it on the ubuntu or windows partition ie sda1 or sda2 etc<br>  <br>  PS the question is fairly confusing btw|`|kc2EKYzPaa	You do not need to format the whole hard disk. If you want to see files on the Windows partition (C:) the follow the instructions..<br>  <br>  1. Click on 'Places' in menu. (You can see this between the 'Applications' and 'System' in Panel)<br>  2. Then click on relevant partition(Which you want to open).<br>  3. Sometime it will ask to provide your password. Then insert your password of ubuntu(Password given when you were creating the user account).<br>  4. Then it will mount your partition.<br>  5. Now go to Desktop, You can see that your partition is there. So now you can do what you wanted.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

This has a function on the second tab - "More Options" - to flush all restore points except the most recent one. This should reclaim a couple of gigs.<br>  <br>  2. Switch System Restore off for a moment and then switch it back on. This will flush ALL previous restore points:<br>  Right Click on "computer" icon and choose "Properties". In the properties panel select "system restore" at the left. In the system restore panel, clear the checkmark in the disk you want to free up. Click "Apply". Click to authorise the flush. Don't forget to put the tick back again before clicking OK to close the system restore box.|`|bZRhT2HFaa	Are you sure you transferred and not copied? I would double check to be sure that they are off of the C drive like you said. If you copied then everything is still on C, but also on E.  Also, there are the OS files that would remain on C that you can't copy over, but I am guessing you mean things like word docs, music files, etc. <br>    As for defragging, Windows likes to have 15% free to do a proper defrag and even then it is not the greatest. If at all possible, try to get it down to about 25% then defrag, then you should see a big improvement in the number of fragmented files.|`|5yPJAWDRaa	scan your computer of viruses and try windows disk cleanup tool or something like that. if it dosen`t works look at your desktop. all the data stored on your desktop is in the drive c (same drive as the win), so move files from the desktop too.|`|nLNq2PD0aa	Maybe you should scan your computer for viruses or format it.|`|6WFIBwNlaa	run disk cleanup from start/accessories/system tools clean c:.

FBQZ06vraa	There's a decent chance you tried to read an ID that was longer than the 4 characters you've allocated for ID[4].  I don't know if your version of C++ does a limit check on the input, but it seems to check the stack (good for it!) and has found it overwritten.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|tsBL19qzaa	char is a single character. You want to use a string, at least for this case.<br>  <br>  #include <string><br>  #include <iostream><br>  <br>  using namespace std;<br>  <br>  int main(int argc, char* argv[])<br>  {<br>  string id;<br>  <br>  cout << endl << "enter id: ";<br>  cin >> id;<br>  cout << "You entered: " << id << endl;<br>  return 0;<br>  }|`|AA10322987	Simplicity itself, but if you haven't learned it yet, you will now!<br>  <br>  Strings in C/C++ are funny in that you need to reserve one more character than you think. Always, always, always. Did I say always?<br>  <br>  You MUST make the array size one larger than your longest string. The reason for this is that C/C++ indicates the end of the string by storing a null terminator (typically a zero byte) after all the characters of the string.<br>  <br>  Thus, when you input B001, your programs stores these four characters PLUS THE NULL TERMINATOR in your array. Fitting five characters into four doesn't work very well, and you run past the end of your array, corrupt the stack and get the error message that you received.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, always make your string array one count larger than your longest possible string.|`|jiakNb3Haa	your code " cin >> ID" is the problem.<br>  <br>  You need a index  like <br>  cin >> ID[0] <br>  cin >> ID[1]  <br>  cin >> ID[2]<br>  cin >> ID[3]<br>  <br>  C++ does not bounds check so don't add cin >> ID[4] <br>   start at 0 end at 3 for a array with 4 elements

This blueprint includes attributes and methods that the created objects all share.<br>  <br>  More technically, a class is a cohesive package that consists of a particular kind of metadata. It describes the rules by which objects behave; these objects are referred to as instances of that class. A class has both an interface and a structure. The interface describes how the class and its instances can be interacted with via methods, while the structure describes how the data is partitioned into attributes within an instance. A class is the most specific type of an object in relation to a specific layer. A class may also have a representation (metaobject) at runtime, which provides runtime support for manipulating the class-related metadata.|`|4LHBVe5Haa	<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/...</a><br>  <br>  "What is Class in Java?"<br>  <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/concepts/class.html" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/...</a>|`|qVnW1xfMaa	Classes are the basis for the entire concept of object oriented programming.

WJD3bVH0aa	It doesn't sound like the program itself is at fault... how fast is your processor? When I tried to do animations on my old crappy computer with the terrible processor, it lagged badly because it couldn't handle running the program properly. It could also be your file size... are you working with really large files at all? Have you also updated your Flash player to the newest version? The Flash program and Flash player need to be updated separately, so it could just be a matter of getting the newest player to fix the lag.

vEqUqlliaa	A Web portal is a site on the World Wide Web that typically provides personalized capabilities to its visitors, providing a pathway to other content. It is designed to use distributed applications, different numbers and types of middleware and hardware to provide services from a number of different sources. In addition, business portals are designed to share collaboration in workplaces. A further business-driven requirement of portals is that the content be able to work on multiple platforms such as personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and cell phones.

A quick way to tell is if you look in the task bar (lower right of the screen).  If there is a red X attached to the speaker symbol, then you do not have Vista sound drivers installed.  <br>  <br>  If you do have sound, then consider WINAMP.  Its much better that Windows Media Player, and there is a free version.<br>  Cheers!

1bTcvl8Saa	This software was easily available as a torrent download on sites like Mininova a couple of years ago. I don't recommend downloading it this way as quite often you will get software laced with viruses, and it is probably illegal (I'm not sure of the legalities of DL-ing software if you have a legitimate serial and proof of purchase). Your best bet is to find someone with a legitimate copy and borrow their CD, then use your legitimate serial.<br>  <br>  I use PS 7.0 frequently for plug-ins that don't work with newer versions, so I always keep back-ups handy on CD and as data on a flash drive. I highly recommend backing up your disc when you find a legal copy.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you had a friend or business associate with a copy they might FTP it to you.|`|bcqS54bfaa	Use a torrent...

Or did you lose your software? Are you making sure when you tried to download from brothersoft you were downloading the correct format for either Windows or Mac? That can definitely make a difference. Ok, so if you already have it and want to upgrade, you can go to Adobe's website, I checked it and they do have Photoshop add ons etc. I just did a search within Adobe's website for Photoshop 7.0. If you lost your original software and have the related information, then you can call the supplier and tell them you lost it and I think they will either send you a replacement disk or send you an email with a link or something. Also, you may want to try calling Adobe and asking them what you can do. They would be the company to call since they actually manufacture the software. If you contact a supplier, they may not know. Adobe can simply answer the question on whether it is possible or not and save you the trouble of searching and searching when it may not even be an option, ya know? Another route to go would be Downloading "Limwire".

glFDVwklaa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

Disk Suite puts a range of tools at your fingertips to provide optimum system performance and improved stability and security.<br>  <br>  Clean and Optimize<br>  With Disk Suite you can safely Cleanup and Optimize your Windows? disks with a few simple mouse clicks. Disks can become bloated with temporary files, log files and other unnecessary data. The Cleanup and Optimize feature lets you safely remove unnecessary files and bloat from your PC without detailed knowledge of the Windows? file system. Removing bloat will not only make your PC perform better, but will also provide you with more free space to store your own files.<br>  <br>  Disk Defrag<br>  It's a fact that fragmented drives drain critical system resources, compromise the ability to access your files efficiently and slow down Windows? start-up.<br>  <br>  Defragmentation is one of the best methods of boosting system performance by optimizing the way files are arranged on the disk. By reorganizing the files using the disk defrag feature, the process of accessing those files becomes more efficient, creates a greater amount of free space on the hard drive and allows you to use that space more effectively.<br>  <br>  The defrag feature provides you with a powerful defragmentation tool that supports both NTFS and FAT file systems. Different levels of defragmentation are provided in case you just need a quick defrag or you want to schedule a complete optimization of your disk.<br>  <br>  Backup & Restore<br>  The Backup feature allows you to make copies of your data that can be restored in the event that files become lost, damaged or corrupted. Taking regular backup is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure you don’t lose irreplaceable data and files such as photos, documents and other information.<br>  <br>  The Backup feature in Disk Suite allows you to tailor the backup to meet your needs by selectively choosing the files to protect. It also allows you to restore files as needed, and verify your backup to ensure valuable data can be recovered as needed.<br>  <br>  Diagnostics and Repair<br>  Physical disk and file corruption is one of the main causes of data loss. The Repair feature allows you to actively monitor the health of your disk and file systems and where possible repair corruption and errors. It also allows you to schedule or directly run different types of disk integrity checks and identify future disk corruption so issues can be quickly discovered and resolved.<br>  <br>  The repair feature performs integrity checks to check file system structure, surface scans to check for bad sectors and disk errors as well as repair hard drive problems. In addition the repair feature includes hard disk diagnostics and lets you review the information including the S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) status of your hard drive (if supported).<br>  <br>  PC Tools Disk Suite Full Version Information<br>  Current Version: 2009 (1.0.0.65) <br>  File Size: 7,318 KB <br>  Operating System: Designed for Windows?
