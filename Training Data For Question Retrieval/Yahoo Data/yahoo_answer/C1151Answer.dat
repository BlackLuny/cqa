That's old. Try and simile more.|`|ubZpZ8HUaa	i agree with austin :)|`|h1OCYD7Gaa	I am so sorry you feel this way.  I think you need to first stop comparing yourself to her.  Be confident with who you are, and love yourself.  Maybe she just radiates confidence, and guys are attracted to her OR intimidated by you because you look so good that they are going for the less attractive one hoping they have  a shot with her.  Its ok to be short, I am only 5'1'' also!  Its OK and there is nothing wrong with being short.  Keep looking presentable, don't give into the whole "I-don't-care-about-what -I-look-like-so-I'll-wear-sweats" thing, its really not cute.  Relax, stop comparing yourself to her because I bet you are an amazing person and you'll get a boyfriend one day, just wait it out.  Everything happens for a reason ok.|`|6cbgbDazaa	Try to bevome more comfortable with yourself.:) People probally thinks she's older beacuse of her height obviusly, but she probally also looks more rleaxed. If you always try to out due her, or think about it , it won't help. Just be comfortable with being her friend, and know your just as bautiful as she is:D|`|qWOvlh4faa	Everyone are special in their own way.<br>  Ask yourself, would you like to get asked out by different boys every day?

The only way you can change anything is if you take out the negative thoughts. In 7th grade, I used to be ugly and fat, and I had the msot gorgeous best friend. I remember when other people hung out with the both of us, they would also be talking to her, but when I actually opened my mouth they saw that I was worth talking to too. I had a great, outgoing, funny personality, so people liked talking to me a lot more. That's what amde me not feel so ugly. <br>  <br>  Now, looking back at those years a long time ago, I don't even think I was that bad looking. I looked just average and normal, even though I thought I was extremely ugly at the time. Maybe it's just that your friend is gorgeous and you put her above you because of that.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you think you're prettier, than like I said, it's msot likely your personality. Maybe she has that more appealing, friendly look and smiles a lot and laughs a lot, while you look like your mad or frowning.

HOdblqIkaa	I have one in between/on my shoulder blades and it didn't hurt a bit. Its only words though so there wasn't any filling in. It took about 45 min and I really didn't feel too much at all. That wasn't my 1st tattoo and all I can say about the pain is I don't find it to be that bad. Basically the easiest way I can describe it is take a pin and drag it along your skin. Its a tingly pain and once you break skin it stings but not for long. Its more annoying than painful. I figured having a tattoo on bone would hurt so bad but I have one on my ribs hip foot and lower back and honestly it was the one on my lower back that hurt the most, which is the only one not mainly on a bone. Just relax when you go get it done it'll go by really fast.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	it stung when i got mine's on the top portion of my arm, but it wasnt intense pain...if your parents are ok with it, go for it! i've been told that the most painful site for a tattoo is on the ankle...however, like i've said before, make sure its a tattoo you will still be proud of when you're 60 yrs old and your skin isnt as taunt as when you were young...|`|ErpMx1ibaa	sometimes it hurts, it just depends on how much you can take the pain. mine didn't hurt at all. the pain only last for a little while. it worth it in the end.|`|hv2nmmrqaa	Hurts so bad i have seen 6 people die from the pain.........yes 6 people.<br>  <br>  i would describe the pain of a tattoo to a burning sensation, like dragging a hot pin around your skin.
GiMJULi7aa	hi. i have been having acne since 5th grade!! I was the first girl who had a zit. Well, I would recommend you do the following, wash your face 2 a day (the best is neutrogena) and do not touch your face. But there are other things you can do. I can't guarantee this will help u in specific because everyone is different but i would just simply use a gentle cleanser, and a toner. But there are some home remedies you can use such as an apple face mask, because of all the antioxidants in apples. And also a baking soda mask. This really helps me and keeps my skin soft. Just mix backing soda with water until forming a thick paste. Then apply to your face and wait until it starts drying and crumbling off your face.  search home remedies for acne on the internet, and u will get tons of results!! oh and one thing, DO NOT USE THE LEMON MASK, that will irritate your skin, use only the ingredients u think are gentle enough for your skin. Good luck and i hope this helped!! And for the best products, I put the links below. Oh and try proactive, I havent tried it but my best friend tried it and loves it!!|`|QMbxBynZaa	mkay, im fifteen and i use both the neutragena acne wash (its simply amazing for zits and it makes your skin soft !!) and i use the clean and clear energizing face wash (which is good for black heads and make up removing)<br>  clearasil works but after a while youre zits become imune to it and come back trust me ! <br>  oxyfree is really good if you have tolerant skin (and i mean really tolerannt) other wise it makes you break out, i can use it but it has a weird smell haa<br>  i suggest washing with the ones i use (stated above) and cleaning your face with rubbing alcohol (like on a cotton ball) three times a day, it works magic i swear !|`|RvqYrdBHaa	i have very oily skin and found proactive to be great for it.|`|NTrBagbHaa	I use proactive and that $**** works! i don't care what anyone says if u use that stuff like you're supposed to it WILL work. there's a vending machine at the mall closest to my house and its like a proactive vending machine it's weird i've never seen it. i ordered it off tv at first and when i ran out i went to that stupid machine and bought some more! the repairing lotion and the refining mask work GREAT! shoot its all good...i use the facial cleanser in the shower and then got some sort of toner to get all the makeup and dirt off that the shower missed and i got a eye makeup remover n use that too. then after i get everything off i use the repairing lotion and i sleep in it (its clear not white so u cant see it) then i wake up and put the moisturizer on b4 my makeup. I don't even get little bumps anymore...oh and i had a few spots on my face from previous break outs that i thought would like never go away and they did. well now that i wrote a novel about proactive lol...i should be a spokes person ha ha...GET PROACTIVE it works!|`|ljF7e162aa	I personally LOVE neutrogena acne stress control power-foam wash. This stuff works wonderfully as a gentle cleanser. Do not dry out your skin too much because this will make your skin produce more oil which will aggravate the problem. Go to the doctor and they can prescribe medicated creams and antibiotics, Minocycline really helped clear me up. I saw a 50% reduction in acne in just 2 weeks|`|BSlVGJ62aa	I hear you. I have horrible acne. That's one reason I like my avatar because she is acne free. Neutrogena is what I am using now and it does not work well. At all. Actually my skin worsened sense I started using it. Proactive is very good but can get annoying because it is a very long process that has to been completed properly and has to be done mourning and night. Actually most acne products don't work well. On my skin the best results were when I wash my skin with soap and water. And it is so not that hard to do unless you have finger artherides. Hope I helped. I can't wait to see what other answers say.|`|5lB7SyGAaa	I'm sixteen and I had the same problem, I tried basically everything. My best option was going to a dermatologist. Their the only ones that will be able to tell you exactly what you need. Trust me the results are worth it!|`|AA10069767	I've used all of those including Proactive and several things from a derm. and LOTS of products from sephora.<br>  Right now I'm using clean & clear and it works better then anything else I've ever tried!!!!!!|`|LfGtp0R6aa	try..the 'WAVE'(:<br>  WORKS TREMENDOUSLY(:|`|8TI7bbKhaa	proactiv. trust me it works.|`|PUUXbVK2aa	this is going to sound insane, but I saw on the Ellen Show the other night, this women uses liquid glue to get rid of blackheads.<br>  she puts it on her nose, leaves it dry. then peals it off.|`|wYBur7c7aa	You just asked the perfect question! I am fourteen, and I have the worst acne before until I solved my problem on my own. For one don't try make up it just makes it worser if you didn't realize that. Anyways don't waste your money on Proactive because it just a pain in the *** to use and to much work. Try stridex maximum pads which dry out your skin and has this stuff in it that kills the bacteria in the pimples. Also home stuff works great. I just discovered rubbing baking soda with a mix of water on my face as a face mask, it does wonders. Most cheap products help better than those expensive ones. Neutrogena doesn't help much either. I've tried most of there products and same with Clearasil and Clean and Clear.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try my recommendations and I promise it will work faster in about two weeks.
tB5pveZXaa	I Really Like The First purple one!<br>  Also, I would wear flats with it, unless your gladiators are black, because it's a bit less formal to wear gladiators.|`|ce2027c9d7b83863b579bafa301e50d4aa	2 in black or pink.  Black heels or strappy sandals|`|iyEYXiq8aa	THe 2nd one and no to the gladiator sandals|`|V2F8YCa2aa	I lOVE the third one! It's soo cute in pink!!!!!!|`|nuYxVIkUaa	i like the second one.|`|ujomB7iHaa	i like the second but also the first in the same colour|`|DpStw8RBaa	I really like the second dress. I think black dresses are so classy and can be paired with some really cute accessories.<br>  <br>  I have to say a big NO to the gladiator sandals. If you wear the black dress find some cute strappy sandals or some nice heels to go with it.
uLtwGhTfaa	You can get mederma, it's a scar creme I beileve it's the best. You can get at at wal-mart the cheapest I think;it's 20 bucks.  I used it and it helped, I had a scar on my face. And if you wanted to use something else than a scar creme you can buy an aloe vera plant it helps ALOT , plus it's like $1 and it's a natural remedy (some people like natural remedies better) Well either or, are great. :] <br>  -Good luck :D , Hope I helped|`|AG6cAJJyaa	Mix 2 parts pure shea butter and vitamin E oil with 1 part olive oil to the area daily. Trick is to keep massaging the area with your finger tips and to do this daily without fail. I had a gash on my left thigh due to a childhood injury which was pretty bumpy but now it is not that visible (I have been doing it for years now!). <br>  <br>  Shea butter and vitamin e oil are healing oils and help in scar reduction. Olive oil is an excellent moisturizer. <br>  <br>  Also, check out my youtube channel for getting more natural tips on beauty!

Purple would go with the cardigan you're going to wear. You should also wear heels or boots. Super cute outfit you got there :)|`|nzFp11qyaa	Black|`|0OpKpEbEaa	Tights are completely played out.

bAYVSfdJaa	One of mine was pierced at 16g and the other at 18g.  18g is the smallest, and yes you do have a choice (but, usually it's best to ask what gauge your piercer recommends). It doesn't really hurt, but a needle by your eye is a little bit intimidating. Just relax, close  your eyes, and it's done.|`|1rHmtCdLaa	they use 16 gauge which is the same size they use to pierce a persons ear|`|c5anDswjaa	Mine was pierced with a 16g, I think its the most common..

Because of that, my friends call me Panda.. I don't mind though, it's totally true.|`|ojceQQ1Paa	I usually just throw something on in the morning, and my look takes about 10 minutes.

24228cff46f2ae4a925387c435dea376aa	well in the 90's I wondered, why the 70's came back. Why are the 40's back on the beach with those ridiculous skirted bikini's. why did bell bottoms come back? it's all a trend. but I liked the 80's fashions. especially in the gym and dancing. Once upon a time you could show off what you had in the gym just as in the beach. Now your forced to dress like a mummy.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Because fashion goes in cycles.|`|hi2nQNXsaa	that is usually what styles and trends do is all ways come back around.|`|DjOlyTYkaa	The "in" clothing is different each year, and this year, 80's time has come. Big hair, off shoulder shirts, and neon clothing. I love it(:|`|Y232pwoZaa	some of the styles were not too bad in the 80's.

PzbYPcSwaa	depends what kind.....NEVER put on scented lotion on ur face cuz it clogs ur pores and it burns too.........u can buy some lotion for your face at wal mart and its cheap..i got some and ill tell u the name of it later when i feel like getting up out of my bed.<br>  <br>  P.S...im guessing u need lotion bcuz of that medicine u have to take LOL...at least u know its working :D<br>  <br>  choose me as best please|`|PonJcuecaa	You can put hand lotion on your face but your better just buying facial lotion because if you have a tan complexion and you use lotions with certain chemicals then the pigments in your face lighten and your left with blochy white spots! so your better off buying lotion for your face and hands the bottle will say what it can be used on! hope i helped =]|`|rzpPGmzfaa	it would probably clog your pores and possibly irritate your face.

It is gentle enough to get rid of a baby's rash and yet powerful enough to fight blackheads. Just go to the baby's aisle at Wal-Mart or Walgreens. I hope this info helps.|`|tg0RIjMTaa	Biore's Warming Anti-Blackhead Cleanser.<br>  OMG, it's amazing I swear! I have a lot of blackheads around my nose & on my nose, when you use this product, after a week or even less you start seeing results, and after 2 weeks most of them are ALL gone.

I got Clearasil Blackhead Control Astringent on sale, it works really well, but I'm not sure they make it anymore.<br>  <br>  Also, the peel-off strips work pretty well. It depends on the size of your pores. I have large pores on my nose that get blackheads, and the peel-off strips work well there.<br>  <br>  I also use St. Ive's Apricot Scrub or Rite Aid's knockoff of it, to exfoliate the dead skin off the top. Then use astringent or a peel off strip after that to really get them to go away.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|ddJkKGpXaa	you don't want to use an exfoliator, those will make your pores widen. What you can do is take a washcloth and run it under warm water make sure its not too cool, hold it against the area with the black heads then just pop all of your blackheads, then once they are all cleaned out you wash your face of with cold water. And thats something you can do at home, or you can just go to a dermatologist and ask for a treatment that will help clean your face and will not damage it. and if you use make make sure that you get noncomedogenic, this will prevent getting acne.|`|AG6cAJJyaa	Hi, if you are prepared to be patient and fond of using natural or home made cleansers then you can check out my video on youtube for blackhead removal. <br>  <br>  It is a 3 step process - cleansing, toning and moisturizing.

Iwb5ENX6aa	As far as mascara goes, I say go for Diorshow-MAC's aren't great in the slightest.

When you find a haircut you like print out the picture and show it to the hairdresser. It's much easier than trying to explain what you like. <br>  <br>  I quite like this one:<br>  <a href="http://justabouthair.com/scene-hairstyles-/brown-messy-scene-hairstyles-with-highlights.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://justabouthair.com/scene-hairstyle...</a><br>  <br>  but maybe ask for the fringe to be shorter so you can see out of it :P To achieve that messy style look for a good gel or mousse. I actually used to use Garnier Texturing Gum on my hair and it worked really well. It still had movement and didn't may be hair go greasy. <br>  <br>  Here are some more websites with scene hairstyles on them: <br>  <a href="http://www.gallery.becomegorgeous.com/scene_girl_hairstyles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gallery.becomegorgeous.com/sc...</a><br>  <a href="http://scene-hairstyle-facts.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://scene-hairstyle-facts.blogspot.co...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hair.becomegorgeous.com/newest_trends/scene_hairstyles-209.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hair.becomegorgeous.com/newes...</a>|`|7hZdI5sJaa	this is really cutee. print this out if you like it and give it to your styleist. <br>  <a href="http://www.emohaircutstyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/blond-emo-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.emohaircutstyles.com/wp-conte...</a><br>  <br>  :)

2ZsRAxkuaa	Ice compresses (really gently) or really cold sea salt soaks will help the swelling, but warm sea salt soaks will help the pain. I normally do one of each a day :) But don't fiddle with it.<br>  And take some Ibruprofen, which will help with both. Sounds like your glands are swollen too. Which I get with alot of my ear piercings. <br>  <br>  I don't think its infected either, but keep an eye out for any green pus or anything.<br>  White pus is good though, and crust is normal. <br>  <br>  Try to sleep on the other side. But if you can't try one of those aeroplane pillows with the holes in. I find them really comfy.|`|ejLdm1cpaa	Try using Bactine liberally on it. I had the same problem and this takes some of the pain away, and heals/disinfects it quickly. And it's a liquid so it's not all goopy and stuck in your ear like Neosporin. Don't touch it too much, and don't wear headphones for a good while either.|`|MuCf7W3Iaa	Try using some savlon spray && spray it on it. <br>  ive got mine pierced and when i first had mine done i put my head on my arm when i layed down so it dint touch the pillow and wouldn't hurt. <br>  Try not to play about with it or touch it so it heals quicker.|`|1498434f366a56b1b0b7643757ab51b3aa	I think you'll be fine.  I have my left tragus pierced and it was sore for a while.  I tend to sleep on my left side and also couldn't hold the phone to my left ear so it really felt rubbed raw.  Just don't touch it and keep it clean.  The pain eventually goes away.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yeah it's from sleeping on it, and it's still kind of freshly pierced<br>  just keep cleaning it and don't play with it with dirty hands<br>  try to sleep on the other side<br>  <br>  if you are still worried after a week go to your piercer|`|FTs2py0kaa	sounds like you need antibiotics,go to the doc before it gets BAD

2oN7WrVKaa	You can use your fingers, just be sure they are clean!<br>  I use a wet sponge, you can buy them at any drug store.<br>  You can also use brushes, but that usually doesnt give me the best coverage.<br>  Yesss, you put a powder ontop to set the foundation.<br>  But you really only need to do that if youre using a liquid foundation.<br>  You have to do a trial and errors until you find the right shade.<br>  Try matching it up in the bottle with the bottom side of your wrist.<br>  Sometimes the brands make swatches you can use to test.<br>  It shouldnt look fake if you apply it correctly, and if its the right shade.<br>  Another tip is to be sure and take the foundation underneath your chin! Or it looks like youre wearing a mask, which isnt good.<br>  And always moisturize before you put it on, just to keep your skin healthy, and be SURE to remove it before you go to bed! Very important!|`|GBOgsAoDaa	use your fingers and try foundation on a depertment stored like dillars and mays<br>  <br>  hope i hleped:)|`|6ddbc258bcea66dd0bcbcd47cecf412daa	For powder/mineral foundation, you should use a brush. Cheaper ones can be found anywhere, like Walmart. For liquid foundations, you could use your fingers to just spread it out, but for even and the best coverage, use a brush.<br>  Powder foundations could be set, but only if you want to. Most likely (depending on brand, etc.), they don't need to messed around with. Liquid foundations SHOULD be set with a nice base or a pressed powder. As long as you don't apply a lot, and put on multiple layers, it won't look fake and cakey. For liquid liners, only squeeze or pour out a little bit. Basically two drops should do it, and one squeeze. For powdered, lightly tap your brush after you dip (don't press the brush in. Just lightly touch it) it in the powder to get rid of excess.<br>  You should get a shade closest to your skin tone. If you don't know, since it really depends on brands, there isn't a SPECIFIC one that's right for you (some brands name it with colors, some with numbers), ask somebody working there. They'll most likely be more than glad to help.<br>  Good luck and happy hunting!|`|NPfJUm0Baa	Quite contrary to the other answers, I would highly avoid applying foundation with anything but a foundation brush. The brush allows for smoothing and blending. The key to makeup application is BLENDING. Sponges and fingers usually have more dirt than you think. You should always use a pressed or loose powder (use a kabuki brush) after foundation application to "set" your face. You can use MAC Fix and spray it on your face so that your foundation doesn't look too "fake." As far as the shade- you should go to a cosmetics counter to get "matched." You can also try the foundation on your inner wrist. When applied- it should just disappear.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/EverydayStyle" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/EverydayStyl...</a>|`|XPWZbyPqaa	first, find your correct shade, sometimes that can mean you have to blend 2 different ones to find the exact shade but not always. next put however much you will need on the back of your hand and use your CLEAN fingers to put dots of makeup on your cheeks, chin nose and forehead. then us a wet makeup sponge and blend it all over your face make sure to start on the inside and work out, meaning always blend outwards. to finish off the look, put some powder over but not to much and make sure to blend that well. and always make sure to blend really really well around your jaw and hair line so that no one can tell you are wearing it.<br>  <br>  hope i helped!! =]

hvqj7e0Daa	TOO MUCH.|`|AA11461724	well at sally's they sell 30 volume and 40 volume bleach kits that come with the bleach packet, either 30 or 40 volume peroxide, a tint brush, gloves and i think a mixing bowl. i think the kit is around $7.00. or you can get each item separately, bleach packet is about $3.00 and peroxide comes in different prices depending on the ammount you get, but no more than $5.00 i think. if you want to dye your hair after you bleach it, yes, you will have to buy the dye and peroxide separately. a bottle of dye is anywhere from $3.00 to $6.00 depending on the brand and a bottle of 4 ounce 20 volume peroxide is like a dollar something. but dyes at sally's are professional and may produce some unwanted results if you're going to dye after bleaching - ie use an ash blonde dye over bleached hair, it will turn green. so ask the girl there that knows most about hair coloring, she will be able to help you with everything you need. good luck!

fzAaPFelaa	It all depends on what kind of mascara your using. You always want something that will lengthen the look of your lashes. If you have very short eyelashes, i would buy some false eye lashes, those always make your lashes look the all the celebs. I use the Revlon one, the one with 2 tubes of mascara. One side is white and you put that on before you put the colored mascara. It actually helps you before you actually want to put the actual mascara on. It allows you to seperate and style them before you apply the black or brown. Also if you use a eyelash curler, you can curl them and as your curling them, use a blowdryer on medium heat and it would help them stay. Hope it helps.|`|1SKN7SoDaa	This kind of works for me:<br>  Instead of putting the wand horizontal when applying mascara, position it so it's almost vertical. Dip the want into the tube so you get lots of mascara onto it and apply it onto the end of your lashes. Also remember to even the lashes/mascara out so it isn't clumpy and the lashes stick together. <br>  Good luck. ;)|`|8PmgWto5aa	yeah, either eyelash extensions if you want the quick fake way or lots of mascara is what I do and it looks long.|`|AA11595360	buy GOOD Mascara|`|AA10139925	The best technique I've found is to use Cover Girl's Professional mascara which is a good inexpensive product. I would use the blackest color which gives more depth to the lash and then use a curler.  The trick is to preheat the lash curler with your dryer for a few minutes and then apply to your lashes.  It will "heat" the lash so it will curl and then apply several coats of mascara, letting the one coat dry for each application.  If that isn't really giving you longer lashes, then you can apply the single lashes you see and they really are natural looking if you only apply a few.|`|uij93NOjaa	Buy an eyelash curler because that helps the most and they aren't that expensive either.

There's plenty of websites out there that sell cheap piercing supplies.|`|k10aY5M3aa	if you have to ask "how", you probably shouldnt be doing it right now. if she really wants YOU to do it, maybe you should find out how to go about getting lessons or something..if they have that.|`|bJFJ1l6daa	Thats gross.|`|XCtKpwkwaa	You can buy a peicing kit online and then put the needle through and its peirced. but the heeling time is a couple of months, and it hurts badly for those couple of months|`|xbzCxo8yaa	you would have to numb them first.......just like when you are piercing ears................put ice on them then pull a needle through with white thread in it................the healing time is longer than for ears, I've heard

If you have any questions about their products you can always go to Sephora and they will help you with your selections. I usually only splurge in eyeliner and eye shadows. Because they stay forever and I love the colors. Everything else I get from wal-mart or any drugstore...like my powder foundation, mascara, concealer and lipgloss.|`|BvjPU3wkaa	I honestly don't think that there is one brand out there that excels when it comes to every product.  Every brand has weak products.  If I had to choose one brand that I favour I would say Cargo.  I find that they offer the best overall value and, for the most part, outstanding products.<br>  <br>  Stila is a good brand but I find that many of their products are hit and miss.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Try with all the usual things such as vitamin E oil and cocoa butter, you say it’s no good however I’d suggest making sure you are using it often enough to make a difference. I would also suggest oils, olive oil is a very skin-positive oil, try that as it will hugely improve skin condition so help heal scaring, I personally have a little spray bottle of olive oil and some nice smelling essential oils that I use after my bath, very good for your skin and helps healing. Another oil to try is coconut oil it’s solid but melts with body heat, the good thing about this is that you can melt it down with other skin-positive ingredients such as shea butter and vitamin E oil, then keep it in a little pot to use when you need it, it is very oily but very good for your skin. Bio oil is a good choice too, it can be bought from most pharmacies but is expensive so I recommend trying in discount stores which sometimes sell a cheaper version that works just as well. <br>  <br>  If your scars really bother you then you might want to get an appointment with a  dermatologist to have them assess the scars to see if they can offer you any treatment, it may be worth mentioning this to your doctor to see if they could suggest anything.|`|tsQYHCL9aa	bio oil maybe|`|52b03a500667fa8a3a92fe8c6e8edc55aa	You might just have to go see a professional to help with scaring.  They can do wonders and have special products for whatever type of problem you wish to resolve.  Try seeing a skin doctor and see what they say.  You might even be able to get a free consultation and they might even be able to help you find a product to try before you decide to have them do any procedures.

VPmHIvtJaa	If you want something to sort out the acne, Tea Tree oil is very good, you can get it at Holland and Barrett, Boots, an organic shop etc, it's not that expensive. All you have to do is put a couple of drops in water in the skink and wash your face with it, or apply using a cotton wool pad. Just take note it is veryyy strong.<br>  If you want somethnig to sort out the un-even skin tone, buy "Bio-oil". I think you can get it online, but you can also purchase it in boots, however, it is quite expensive. Around ￡13 for a medium size bottle, but it will last ages, and it is really worth it.<br>  With Bio-oil, you can apply afew drops and rub in just using your fingers, or you can also put afew drops in your sink and wash your face. you use it 2-3 times a day, I know it's alot of hassle but it works. (:<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  x|`|2eW4z4Hmaa	I got all of my info from here|`|YCplcBnlaa	drink <b>A LOT<b> more water and eat <b>more<b>healthyy foods instead ofgreasyy food bout, that doesn't mean you have to stop eating greasy,oily foods cold turkey just eat less then maybe that will help with the skin problem!!!!!!!!|`|jXb1vos3aa	Drink more water!! that's the first thing you should do, it washes away toxins and it keeps your bowel movement regular, thus making your skin look better!<br>  I've tried it and it really works.

AA10450854	No, uggs should not be worn with anything.|`|AX13vUJeaa	Uh.....no?|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Yes, why not.<br>  Black and brown are quite a current fashion statement, but usually with a contrast colour like red or orange, which lifts a bland outfit.<br>  Some, orange/red and black/brown accessories will coordinate the whole look.<br>  Scarves and chunky jewellery are the first possibles which spring to mind.<br>  Black and brown are so far removed from the colour palette that they can't clash.|`|fDKh1iw5aa	Fashion specialists say never to mix brown and black together in an outfit. It just looks, gross. But, YES, you can do it, if you have the right shade of black and the right shade of brown. But I don't think with black jeans and your brown uggs they are going to be the right shade. Good luck :)<br>  <br>  ---> But maybe you can wear a.) different color uggs or b.) different shoes or c.) different color jeans|`|b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Black and brown are both neutrals and they can be worn together.<br>  However, Uggs should not be worn unless it is below freezing and/or there is snow on the ground where you live.|`|NEhE5C6zaa	ewwwww.<br>  N00O0O.!|`|1cd96baaffdfd1f12caee55512ecbd35aa	no. black & brown clash. you should just wear blue jeans with that.

I've done this a few times and it just goes ginger/burns your scalp/makes your hair fall out.<br>  A salon would have to bleach it twice because your hair is quite dark and this is really damaging so don't do it if your hair is already dyed. They can help chose a colour.<br>  Probably a sandy/strawberry blonde would suit you.<br>  Good luck!! x|`|H6woERgaaa	Hey,<br>  It is hard to say without actually seeing it, but I know a website that could help.

Zynzkj1raa	Please don't consider everyones, "omg, yes, plz do it!" to heart.<br>  <br>  I strongly, STRONGLY, STRONGLY agree with the first answer.<br>  <br>  You sound smart, and you type well, so I know you won't take this offensively, because I'm only trying to help.<br>  <br>  I know straightening hair can be pleasing and rewarding with the outcome of straight hair at first, but it becomes a chore, and it really damages your hair. Especially people with curly hair.<br>  Your hair looks very thick and coarse in the picture even after you straightened it. Well - it will be ten times as worse when you get layers and leave it un straightened. It will be frizzy and hard to manage.<br>  <br>  If you get your hair in layers, it will increase the poofiness, and you will have to straighten it everyday, unless you want to go out with a miniature version of an afro.<br>  <br>  I strongly think you should leave it. Let it grow out. Straighten it when you want, or leave it curly when you want, and it'll look good both ways.<br>  <br>  I have friends who have hair like yours, and they look gorgeous with it naturally curly AND straight. <br>  <br>  If anything, just cut it shorter, and clip off all those split ends.<br>  <br>  But unless you promise yourself that you will straighten your hair everyday,<br>  please don't get layers.<br>  <br>  Like everyones mentioned, you COULD possibly go to the salon for a straightening perm or to get it chemically straightened, but I don't think you should damage your hair, since it is already curly and frizzy. <br>  <br>  It's just that, people with your kind of hair don't go well with layered cuts.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and I hope you'll listen to me. :P<br>  <br>  P.S - You are very pretty. :)|`|JDogbPg6aa	"technically its not that scene"? lololol|`|Vi9Mdz1vaa	I'm dying to get the haircut you want.<br>  But it wouldn't work for me.<br>  It would definitely work for you.|`|4DSyEqTuaa	yes! u totallyyy could and i luv tht cut btw<br>  but<br>  u would have to put A LOT of effort into straightening it everyday i reccomend getting the japanese hair straightening thing so u wouldnt have to straighten it every day. my friend does tht and she has hair just like urs & its lasted her about a year.... :)<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|adzsjFxhaa	You can definitely pull it off, and I like that cut, I wish I could get it but then ppl in my school would call me goth, becuz theyre idiots lol, but it wouldnt look goth on you, it would be really nice, post a pic whem u get the cut!|`|qdWOwXBfaa	It would look terrible with your facial structure and hair texture, Don't get it seriously, you'd never ben able to take care of it and have it look like in the picture.|`|w1BC4paiaa	Definitely. & you wouldn't even have to wear it straight all the time.

I would look for something a little more flattering for your particular hair type. Not everyone can pull off every kind of hair cut. Good luck.|`|22EVxBYWaa	haha yea u totally could!(:<br>  this is actually  the cut ive wanted to get too.<br>  <br>  ps - ur realy pretyy(:<br>  <br>  also ps - thanks for answering mine !|`|DEkQe6Zpaa	sorry if it seemed like I was saying that in your last question..I wasn't.  I'm just saying that straigthening your hair every day is going to cause hair damage in the long run -- as well as the fact that I personally don't like the hair style.  Maybe not what you wanted to hear but Hope I could help :)|`|lhrMI9f5aa	No, it would look horrible, sorry.|`|mS0ulYUoaa	yes if u straighten it like in hte pick then yesssss and the girl tht said u look like jaslene ur sooo right! u do remind me of her sooo much!!!|`|H6D6jlKGaa	Yeah, I think it would really suit you!! Go for it!!|`|QevBVANtaa	Yes I think it would look really good. But your hair looks really thick. And the picture of the cut you want, her hair is very thin. Ask the hairdresser to thin your hair. I think it'll look great|`|NgGpaQrqaa	OH HELLL YESSS!!!<br>  i hate when people call me or someone wanting scene hair a poser! =[<br>  u are def not one!|`|0ioylgULaa	yes, do it . :]|`|IphovWxaaa	yeah|`|U5RTRzKiaa	I really think that would look good on you. You could definitely pull it off. And thanks for answering my question. Good luck :)|`|3NdBYdlOaa	it would be cool to get scene hair(I was gonna get it too)but you're gonna straighten your hair like crazy|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	yes!|`|bGuGwprDaa	i do not think that would be a good cut for you, if ur hair is naturally curly then it would just poof up really bad, and you would ALWAYS have to straighten your hair! if you wanted to get something like it then get the same cute but longer layers, and i think that would look great! and if you did want to get that cut, you could always think about getting a perm. i personall DO LOVEE the haircut, but i can't gt it becasue i also have curly hair :( <br>  <br>  PS: your rreally pretty!!!<br>  <br>  ?HoPe ThIs HeLpS?
0KFWzKWKaa	I say absolutely.  When I went to Hawaii is had milk creamy skin.  I tanned in a tanning bed for about a month to build up a base tan.  I'm so glad that I did.  My friends that I went with didn't and burnt to a crisp.  Just start going in a bed for 10 minutes and then build up to the full 20 minutes just before you go on vacation.  <br>  You are also young, don't worry about cancer now since it sounds like you've taken care of your skin your whole life.  One week in the sun is not going to give you skin cancer or make you more likely to get skin cancer.  The constant exposure creates that.  I study cancer for a living.  tanning is a natural shield your body makes against the harmful rays of the sun.  Tanning isn't horrible! Any sunburn is.  Prevent the burning at all cost, even if it means building a base tan before you go.|`|SChPelifaa	Yes! You need to go tanning in the tanning bed. Last year I did that for the Bahamas and Im so glad I did, because I still burned but I know I would have even more if I had not. I am going to Mexico at the end of April, so I plan on going to the tanning bed before hand. You need to expose your body gradually, and wear sunscreen! I am an esthetician, and I cannot stress to you how important sunscreen is, unless you want wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and broken capillaries-these all turn into age spots.|`|MnewrjTAaa	NO!  Tanning beds use UVA rays.  These are the aging rays.  (The other rays are UVB rays.)  You now have to sign incredibly scary forms at tanning places essentially saying they're not liable for damages no matter what additional horrific things we find out about tanning.<br>  <br>  DO NOT TAN!  IT IS BAD!<br>  <br>  Just take sunscreen and sun-protective clothing to Jamaica.  Oh--and you won't have any trouble finding big beautiful hats there, either!|`|Xwb0mX3Yaa	u should go tanning before jamaica because ur gonna get burned ..ur not gona burn in the tanning bed .go for like  10 or 20 min. using tanning lotion|`|HLmd17r9aa	I am also going to Jamaica in May :)<br>  I suggest going tanning a few times before you go so that you won't burn. I go tanning anyways, but my mom, who does not, will go a few times before heading to Jamaica. Your skin will be able to protect itself better in the sun if you prepare it a little before you go. You only have to go 5-10 times for 6 minutes or so each time. Wear sunscreen while you are in Jamaica too!|`|dc6WFVUhaa	Chances are if you burn outside you're going to burn even more in a tanning bed.<br>  <br>  But if you do decide to go tanning, whatever you do don't start off at the full 20 minutes.<br>  If you have porcelain skin you would probably want to start at maybe 5-7 minutes.
WGFtXo6Paa	To start off with, I would like you to rip off your hair and put it on my head because I want it. <br>  <br>  Just kidding, but I would suggest putting it half up, half down. Like, leave your bangs out, and pin some of it back, maybe make a little poof.<br>  <br>  Also, I would do 2 small braids. Again, leave out your bangs, and grab just al ittle of your hair on both sides, and braid, and clip them back. Sort of gives htat "boho" feel.<br>  <br>  Maybe do something like this too: <a href="http://fashionfeen.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/lauren-conrad-love-me-eyes.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://fashionfeen.files.wordpress.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  Also, I would suggest making your layers noticeable, if you have layered hair. Something like this (the girl Sierra):<br>  <a href="http://x13.xanga.com/044f142059c30231886210/b182864491.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://x13.xanga.com/044f142059c30231886...</a><br>  <br>  I would also do something like this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShBlOnyiwgw&feature=PlayList&p=6FEC721DDB807C9E&index=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShBlOnyiw...</a><br>  <br>  also, a ponytail like this would suit you:<br>  <a href="http://s291.photobucket.com/albums/ll302/brittanyXisaXdino/?action=view¤t=scene-5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s291.photobucket.com/albums/ll302...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  And btw, I looked at your profile and it's so nice what you're doing to help people!

UbrN5yytaa	I have straight hair but it's super poofy.<br>  I own a Sedu Original 1" and it works really well for me.. brings out the shine and makes my hair healthier and softer.<br>  I would choose a flat iron with heat temperature setting and has tourmaline, titanium, and ceramic plates.. these will help your hair when you are using it.<br>  If you are going to order from folica.com, wait until they have a sale.. Because during the sale, you can find the flat irons for $10 off or even $20. I got my Sedu for $83 when they had the 20% off sale<br>  And to answer your last question, it's definitely worth the money. My old Conair made my hair so dry it was like straw.|`|YhjTbSmDaa	The Sedu one is great, from what I've heard.<br>  But I have a GHD one, and its fantastic.<br>  <br>  It doesnt smell after mulitple uses, and its still going strong after 2 years.<br>  <br>  I too, have straight hair, with ocassional waves.<br>  So I suggest either Sedu or GHD.|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Chi! Its great. Its better than all of the listed above. You can get them on ebay for like $60 Brand new in the box if you don't want to order one for $130|`|URJyU1q5aa	Don't get the CHI! I use to have that and it worked for awhile but then I found a better one...it's the nano titanium by babyliss pro. it's blue. It is the best straightener I have ever bought and it makes my hair soft and shiny too. And it heats up just as fast as the CHI. I've had it for like almost 4 months now and it still works like i just bought it yesterday. The straightener is thin and the part that your hair goes in is long so its easier. I got mine at a beauty store|`|5y2Ga65vaa	i had a chi for about two years. i loved it.<br>  it probably would have lasted much longer if i didnt drop it on the floor so much :P i have SUPER curly hair, and it did the job great for me. I recently got a professional flat iron for my birthday. Of course, it works better but If you don't have super curly hair, a chi is more than perfect for you.|`|xpeBsik0aa	I straighten my hair basically every day (I have short, thin, fine hair) and I use a Revlon. I don't know what model it is but it's small and purple, and square instead of long and skinny.|`|tqYpkDyEaa	Chi for sure. <br>  <br>  They heat up mega fast and they smooth your hair so much.  Your hair feels like silk after.|`|950rX2viaa	I would say Chi is the best i have one and my hair is sometimes wavy and that is the best one i have ever had. It takes the tempature of ur hair and then makes the strightener fit ur hair!

Another style would be to go for some skirts, above the knee, not floral, but light and bright solid colors. Check Roxy and American Eagle Outfitters. Shorts are also a give in, I personally, adore Roxy for shorts. Tops, simple cute, graphic Tees, are adorable. Find some that you like from the stores that you like. =)<br>  <br>  P.S.

(Not many in the shops at the mo but there will be soon!)<br>  One shoulder evening dresses are the best and I love this one (or a cheaper one like it!)<a href="http://www.frenchconnection.com/product/71xk1/Fast+Bonny+Cotton.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenchconnection.com/product/...</a><br>  This has made me want summer to come even sooner!|`|ACXO5Jloaa	I little summery dress thing and little pumps or flip-flops :)<br>  that would look awesome :)<br>  Also maybe a small cardigan over the dress :)
S38yfhfcaa	maybe you shouldn't go for the straight look, maybe try scrunching it when it's wet and while its drying, curl it with your fingers by wrapping your hair around your fingers, and keep scrunching!  it might give your hair more volume, making you look really pretty! I do this every morning because my hair doesn't look good when i don't do anything to it. But when i scrunch it, or put it in twists over-night while its still damp, it comes out with a lot of volume!<br>  Second, for the straightening problem, try getting VO5's Miracle Mist.

8tLS1XDWaa	I bought a straightener from Walmart called ther aramis I think... and it works really good on my super curly african american hair.. hope this helps|`|K39KQVIQaa	Remington's are amazing.  I use to have the cheapest ones u cud buy (about ￡20) and they were ace! my hair is also wavy/curly and not easy to straighten but they were so good even tho they're cheap! I recently had to replace them because the ceramic wore off.  I now have the remington sleek and curl  (only ￡15 from amazon brand new! bargain off the retail prce!) which are also amazing! They work so well and you can adjust the temperature which you can't do on the cheaper version.  I recommend all remingtons - they are as good as my sisters GHDs! xxx|`|Eej0Ndp5aa	My friend used a wet to straight straightener & her hair fell out. & when I say fell out I mean it was like still on the iron when she pulled it away!<br>  <br>  I use a conair straightener.

ASmWqy0jaa	Okay you're only tqelve, so the best thing is to do nothing really yet. <br>   Go to a website called FRENZOO.COM <a href="http://www.frenzoo.com/beta/" rel="nofollow">http://www.frenzoo.com/beta/</a> do designs there just to bascilly learn. <br>  Practice drawing designs and sketch outfits whenever you want. Learn to sew and maybe create fashions for barbie doll ( im no insulting you. barabie isnt for littlekid lol.) Learn about patterns and sew garment for you doll. <br>  When you get to high school take art and drama so you can learn to draw ( you need to know how to draw in fashion) drama - make coustumes. <br>  <br>  In my high school there is fashion class four grade 11s If you high school will hae that, do that. <br>  Finally at grade 12 take aprentaships for fashion. then the rest you'll learn with gudence yeachers|`|B1OUPWxXaa	go to girlsense.com, you can design stuff and sell it to other girlsensers.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	You need to go to design school or college to major in fashion design.  You take classes teaching you how to sew and all the wonderful work that entails, art history as it pertains to your subject, textile and fabric classes etc  It sounds like you're already working on your skills which is great.  Maybe since you're 12 you can look into taking a sewing class if you haven't already to learn the basics.  If you have already, then see if any local community colleges or art schools have some introductory courses you can take.  Like drawing (you HAVE to develop good quick sketching skills), art, graphic design, or maybe even an introductory fashion course.  If you are really motivated, talk to someone in the counselors office of the design department at a university that offers the fashion design program and see what advice they can give you.  Good luck!|`|tX57rwksaa	Send a coupe of your designs to a magazine dealing with fashion, and to a fashion retailer of note. If they are good designs someone will take notice.

KVzBqWhvaa	Most salons trim your hair before they color anyways so I don't think you need to do it yourself.. unless you know that place doesn't do that.|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	i like ur hair. dont cut it|`|hDzjpF62aa	What you should do id wait until you get it colored because you always dye then cut so that you can get any damage from the dying cut off and also once you see the color you might want it cut a certain way, plus between now and the time you get it colored it will grow a bit so then when you cut it you can keep it as long as possible.|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	Maybe you can just get your ends trimmed instead of getting a haircut?

gu0AxKyiaa	i under stand how you feel but really who cares what they think, you do all the asking you need to do an if they gotta problem with it or you dont feel comfortable then go somewhere else an ask, there is nothing wrong with asking questions about something that is going to be on you for the rest of your life|`|RLoBuvZnaa	It's probably because you look young and don't have tattoos.  A lot of tattoo artists also have attitudes.<br>  <br>  As an artist, I can tell you that people looking for the best deal on a tattoo is very annoying.  Although that may not be your intention, asking for a price estimate might give that impression.|`|d9B4EVFxaa	Well from being friends with two tattooists and both own their own shops it kinda depends on the situation...One, if you look young they might just be thinking great here's another kid that's wasting our time because hes not even legal age to be tattooed(even if you are serious unless you talk to them and explain they don't know). Two, they might think your just looking for the price not the quality of the tattoo...(its one thing for me as their friend and they are the only ones to ever tattoo me to just come out and ask a price but if you just walked in off the street and just asked about a price with out looking at some of their work they might get the wrong impression).<br>  <br>  Try going in, looking at some of their work, and talking with them before jumping into the price!! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!<br>  <br>  <br>  let me know what you think!!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226195645AA2kSrH&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|AA12032352	Do you ask for the price right away? Or do you look at their art first. If you are giving the impression that cost is the only thing deciding where you are going to get your tattoo it might be a turn off for them. <br>  <br>  Look at their books, decided who you want to ink you, talk about your ideas, then ask about cost.|`|2943TijNaa	lol ! this is the same way i felt when i first went to get mine, i had just turned 18. i didnt wanna tell them what i wanted because they would think its dumb lol but in the end they were all cool about it . and because usually if you have to ask you cant afford it. but when i brought my money out, they were my best friend ! hahah<br>  and probably because your 17.<br>  im 19 now and i still don't like going by myself . always bring a friend when you go :]<br>  its better that way|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Well how do you phrase the question? It sounds like you've been to quite a few studios and asked their price - if it's just to see how much money you need to bring, why don't you book an appointment? They might act a little friendlier if they know you're serious about coming to them. Bear in mind they get kids in their many times a day asking about prices, 99% of whom have no intention of getting anything done. So you need to distinguish yourself from them by telling them you're interested in booking an appointment with them from the start.<br>  <br>  Also, tattoo studios can feel a little intimidating for a newbie I know. There is a lot of banter and piss taking. When I was in last week a guy came in for his first tattoo with his girlfriend, and in fairness there was a lot of things to take the piss out of - he was an emo, tried to act cooler than he was, rolled up sleeves with scratched up arms, gay tattoo that matched his girlfriends etc - but he did get ripped, and I did feel a bit sorry for him, but with some places it goes with the territory when you're 'fresh meat' - when I had my first tattoo I got the piss taken so badly that I vowed never to go back there, long story short I ended up having to, and now I have a great relationship with them there, I realise it's just banter and I take the piss back. You just have to get used to them and take everything they say with a pinch of salt!|`|kCdISEGqaa	Tattooed mommy said it well, I always wonder if they're searching for the best deal, not the best tattoo.  I understand shopping around, but, getting a less expensive tattoo isn't always smart.  The quality is not as great.

And they feel that they'll get noticed by older guys (as most girls prefer older guys because they might be a little more mature) and they feel like it'll be easier to get into clubs and parties easier...basically they feel less like jailbait :P.<br>  <br>  Another think is that when some girls see others around them who have boobs or big boobs, they feel that this is the norm, and so they feel abnormal or like they havent fully grown up if they dont have boobs. They just feel out of place and having friends with big boobs just highlights the fact that they dont have aay even more. Its like having all your friends being skinny, and being the only fat one, same concept.<br>  <br>  I have big boobs, and I plan to have a reduction this summer. They hurt, I can barely run or dance anymore, and dancing used to be my life, so without it I feel like I'm losing a part of me ..but with my boobs are big as they are, it just makes it such a hassle to dance, I just feel less "aerodynamite" in a sense, or less agile and free, which is why I liked dancing in the 1st place. Also, it makes it incredibly hard to find a top that looks good on me, because if it fits my boobs, then its huge for the rest of me :( and I can't wear those cute strappy or strapless tops and nice cute tiny triangle top bathing suits. But thats my reason for not liking my boobs. <br>  <br>  Girls with "no boobs" have similar problems though, like not finding close that fit, so we're all in the same boat I guess. One difference is that me, having big boobs, I get alot of attention, and I hate that, whereas girls with smaller boobs tend to be overlooked and get no attention because they arent big enough or are mistaken for being too young/younger than they actually are...not many guys want to be seen as a pedo b/c his girl looks like shes 12 while he's 18 you know?<br>  <br>  Anyways, as I always say, to each his own, so everyone has their own special reasons why they may dislike their boob size, and sometimes you'll find people who celebrate their size for the same reasons that others may hate theirs. <br>  <br>  Sorry for the long post, but I hope I helped :).|`|UbXVjcm7aa	I have really small boobs but I've got some great bras that help give me a lil extra!!

ozWi3TJlaa	It depends on what stores are at your mall.  However, I was in Target the other day and they're starting to put out their bathing suits.  They're always reasonably priced and they sell them as separates, which is great for most people as most of us are not perfectly sized on both the top and the bottom.|`|h0wn23Gaaa	pacific sunwear is really good.

XsqlvtI9aa	1.That sounds great<br>  2.Nope<br>  3.It depends on where you get it done, but it shouldn't cost you more than 4x the price for cutting your hair<br>  4.You can do anything with your hair.
Za3iJC3paa	I have naturally curly hair. The reason why curly hair can hold curls way better than straight is because it is course and textured rather than smooth...my suggestion? Don't knot your hair but when I want my hair to REALLY curl, I won't condition. I will shampoo only for like 3 days. It gives your hair a more raw feel. To fast track this effect. Dry your hair out a bit by washing with shampoo 3 times in a row. While wet, put in something that will make your hair a little more course but NOT hard. I like to use Matrix smooth spray. (I know sounds like a contradiction but it doesn't smooth persay.) plus some hairspray...scrunch your hair if possible.<br>  Let your hair dry. Should be a little nappy. THEN brush with a wide tooth comb Don't brush til smooth...brush until all of the knots are out. THEN go in there with a curling iron. Make sure hair is completely dry before doing so!!!! If your hair isn't dry and coarse when you brush it out, its not going to have the same effect. Sometimes it takes days to build up the perfect texture in your hair..|`|ePT3hRO0aa	umm, did u comb your hair? well if you did that probably took your curls out.<br>  <br>  You should still use hairspray, that is the only thing that would keep your curls.<br>  <br>  try Pantene hairspray its great|`|AILK0BTiaa	don't apply too much hairspray.. and use a product esp designed to hold curls :o)|`|l53zZ0eVaa	Try hot rollers. I have like 2 pairs of hot rollers.  My curls stay in for 2 days!! Ya i know!! But i have to use a high powered flat iron to take em' out|`|tGGVeW3yaa	put hairspray in it before you curl it or mousse then when your finished put on more hairspray to make sure it stays, I did that and it lasted all night long.|`|h0wn23Gaaa	try using hot rollers instead of a curling iron|`|byxCU2nwaa	i scrunch my hair with conditioner.<br>  it keeps it in place :)
3DxWzPUYaa	mmmmm... i think u shoul do it in layers.. but leave the same lenght...ooo n ur hair color is great?|`|7nrhPCf0aa	take a few inches off, get a slight angle and dye it auburn like Miley Cyrus|`|AA11461724	sometimes highlights don't look right on redheads, they tend to turn too orangey. your hair looks nice long, so maybe cut it a bit shorter with some choppy layers, that would be pretty. as for color, you could try getting it a lighter shade of red, and ask the girl doing your hair if she would recommend highlights on that new lighter red color. 'cause i think medium golden or honey blonde highlights on light auburn hair would be really pretty. good luck!
11zPDTJ8aa	Do it. You would amazing in really short hair. Short hair is so popular right now go for it. Tell the stylist you want it cut above the ears and in a wedge in the back with everything cut short except the front.

KgtlyWDXaa	You have no idea how many women spend tons of money to get the look you have naturally - myself included.  Generally, going darker creates a harsh, unnatural look.  The highlights are what make hair look healthy and give it depth.<br>  <br>  Chances are good your mother is right, but you will not be convinced until you try it.  You don't state your age, but I think you should wait until you are at least 16 to make a firm decision, and even then I would suggest you use a product that will eventually wash out after 4 to 6 weeks.  That way if it doesn't suit you you haven't damaged your hair.|`|45lhCKJYaa	I have the same color hair you have and I went to dye mine like Kristen Stewart when she had really black/brown hair.  I dyed it & it looked really cool. Now, I dont recommend doing it at home because dye you would use at home 1.) doesn't last long at all 2.) can leave stains in your hair and 3.) can turn out completely not like you wanted it.<br>  <br>  If you were able to, bring in a picture or something and go to a professional stylist. That is, if your mom says yes.|`|rxsFIt33aa	your can used from shampoo garlic|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes<br>  <br>  <br>  Your mom is right.  Stop being a bad girl.

I think those stores carry them.|`|4v5JhXT8aa	i would go with the revlon, since ur not trying to send to much money, however i do have revlon's blow dryer. and just make sure you get a ceramic kind.<br>  good luck!|`|3bcr9WDKaa	try conair but if u r gonna get 1 make sure it's a really thin kind cuz that's the best.  vidal sasson is also a good kind!|`|BThdUonXaa	revlon|`|baEs4ZcJaa	Try getting conair, i use it because my hair is pretty straight and its nice to be able to curl my ends in.

Patient combing and de-tangeling should help and is really the only way to get it fixed without cutting. But just to warn you, it will take a looooong time. You may want to get several others to help you and separate it into different sections. Start on the bottom and work up to the top.<br>  <br>  It would be best to see a stylist. If there is any way to convince her definitely do it! Otherwise you may not be able to get it undone. Good luck!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	After 4 months you can try to untangle it but I think you're probably SOL. As was said, get her to do a deep conditioning, and grab a comb and just be very gentle. In the end you're most likely going to have to drag her to a stylist to fix. <br>  <br>  And seriously, talk to her about getting some help.|`|FBGMKdqKaa	wrap it in a bun, maybe? <br>  <br>  good lord...that is extreme.

You don't need to wear skin-tight clothes but avoid the temptation to go super baggy.

uLtwGhTfaa	This is what I do :  <br>  -Wash it fresh<br>  -When it's wet, get your towel and crimp it a little but try to get as much water off as possible <br>  - Add some moose, I use herbal essences 'set me up' (turquoise bottle)<br>  - don't put too much, if you don't wanna make it look wet <br>  - Crimp it a little more with the towel<br>  - Blow dry your hair , but only a little, it'll dry more by itself and get more curls like that, if you don't have much and you want more curls add some gel, but not too much, it'll make your hair look too wet.<br>  <br>  Taaada ! Hope I helped :]|`|pT2gciq2aa	when you get out of the shower , apply the product and put your hair in a messy bun !|`|LCcW7KSsaa	If you are white or have "white people-like" straight hair, just get a perm or a texturizer. You can probably even go back to Ulta and buy one out of the box yourself. I am assuming the longer you leave it in, the curlier your hair will get and if you straighten or flat iron it you don't have to worry about it being curly forever.|`|6JNswOpbaa	you can use straighteners go on youtube and type curlin hair with striaghteners to be honist it works better than curling irons !|`|77A0tlKtaa	Yes comb out your hair towel dry it.

qeR967J7aa	Your hair will grow at the same rate, but healthier.  Thus less breakage, making it appear to grow longer over time.  Use a silk pillowcase.  Less damage as you toss and turn during your sleep|`|TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.

ARSnCRLbaa	I think dry skin is dry skin, regardless of colour, but if it's worth anything, I'm a medium complexioned asian person with ridiculously dry skin and I've found that vitamin E oil works wonders on the face. You can buy it at the drug store. When my face gets really dry and flaky, i use it as a serum underneath my facial moisturizer (usually Clinique).<br>        <br>       For the body I use The Body Shop's body scrubs (the one in a tub container). It exfoliates the rough, patchy flakes and it moisturizes with shea and/or cocoa butter. It comes in different scents as well. You can purchase them on their website. Afterwards I use a thick body butter to seal in the moisture.

UbrN5yytaa	There is this product called Color Oops which removes the hair dye in your hair.. that should help<br>  <br>  Can be found at drugstores|`|OgD2DNhgaa	if you bleached your hair, then colored it the color is still going to adhere a little bit. <br>  you're hair is not going to come out bleached again. the color might night stick very well, but when it starts to come out it's going to be an awkward color. <br>  <br>  if you want it bleach blond, you're going to have to bleach it again. or else strip it. <br>  its not going to just go back to that bleach color without bleaching it again.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck though.....<br>  SSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOO bad for your hair.......

bvTXm6SSaa	Because the coherency between each strand of hair is stronger. There is a lot of empty space between each strand of hair.  Once it gets wet, it sticks together.  Think about layering paper mache (the stuff on pinatas).  If you just layer it without pressure it seems to be a light color.  If you apply pressure, forcing the empty space to become filled, the color deepens.  That is why your hair is darker when wet|`|sOO93u5Oaa	Anything that gets wet is going to look darker. If you spill something on your shirt, it will be darker in that one spot. It's just because the material or whatever that is getting water on is getting drenched, so it appears darker.|`|sQ3PG8Ewaa	Hmm..?<br>  I'm staying here in case someone knows the answer.|`|L5JC7SbFaa	I guess its just because its wet.

kunAa0Nmaa	Only you can answer whether or not you'll regret it. I would say if there's any doubt, then you should keep it, just to be sure.<br>  <br>  However, if you need the money, then I'd say go for it and sell it. You'll have pictures to remember it, and what's more important is your marriage in the here and now.|`|QRn984YPaa	Im not married, YET. Lools, im only 16. ;l Umm I wouldnt. doesnt it give u all those memories?? XD|`|83y9Vu5oaa	i would, it will just sit in your closet, and someone else can use it and love it just as much as you did.|`|ssF4GrjGaa	I think you should. Its just going to sit in your closet. You have all the picts to remember it by. Also, if you dont sell it fast it wont be in style. I waited a little too long to sell mine and then it was out of style. Wedding dress trends are changing all the time. I say sell it!|`|Lv0wvXSzaa	if you keep it what purpose does it serve. styles change so much! my mother kept hers in the attick till it dry rotted. i say sell it just make sure you take pictures first. you help out another bride take in some spare cash make more storage space and still have memories!|`|2WYpXY2Yaa	I wouldn't. That's a very Precious thing. It will remind you of the day. If its not a day to remember, then if you feel its right. Sell it. If it was a happy day. I think you would regret it.|`|2lDzUf3waa	hell yea  u will regret that that wedding dress is something that u want to remember of don't sell that!
whdGGApnaa	curl one part of your hair<br>  straighten another<br>  crimp another<br>  and another part in a ponytail<br>  that would look crazy and awesome<br>  that's what my friend did when we had crazy hair day|`|mS0ulYUoaa	do it like emoish wat i mean is like do the lion main it looks super cute u just need to tease it and hair spray and itll look super cute no doubt about it|`|l6PeuLOOaa	ok you should braid your hair anto dozens of tiny braids and then put bright colored clips all over the place.. or you could die you hair purple and put one side into a pigtail and leave the other down|`|3nyoCTBxaa	Okay. I love these kind of days at school! You go to bed with your hair wet. Wake up in the morning don't brush it or anything. Put little pony tails in. Scrunch it really good with hairspray so it won't come out later in the day. Different colors of hair ties. If you have hair dye that comes out put different ugly colors in that you don't like or something. Whatever else. Just make it Crazy!!|`|ASmWqy0jaa	Hey, we had that at our school last week.

vwX2138Vaa	use a cloth and wet it.
W0ZsuxRTaa	I was in Irish Step Dancing performances, where your hair has to be super curly and stay that way for a long time while you're bouncing around and dancing.  What worked well for me was putting rollers in my hair after I showered (so make sure you're hair is wet) and sleeping with the rollers in overnight.  It sounds weird and uncomfortable, but you can buy rollers that are rubbery so they aren't hard and then just make sure you wear some sort of hair net or bandana while you sleep so that the rollers don't fall out.<br>  Also! Put mousse or gel in before you curl your hair.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	My idea is right after a hot shower, dunk your head in cold water should cause a curl effect.<br>  <br>  Cause that's what they do to some swords.|`|AA12041870	Perm it.|`|SzZxgHdtaa	Tongs and hairspray if you don't want it to be permanent.<br>  Don't get a perm, I think it's a bad idea unless you really want curly hair, it just makes it more difficult to style on days when you want it to be straight and neater.<br>  <br>  I think you should try some rollers overnight, nowadays you can get really effective ones, not just ones that create big granny-ish curls.<br>  <br>  Just follow the instructions|`|yje6VNCpaa	if you don't want a perm, use special curling shampoo everyday and curl it with a curling iron. use hairspray to keep it the same way.|`|DiaXZSwEaa	mix moose and jail together slap it in a sloppy pony tail and leave it in over night then take it out of the hair band scruncch it and put a lot of hair spray. it might work it makes my dog look awlsom :}|`|fzAaPFelaa	Get a perm!!! :)|`|xBUNpdgIaa	you could try twisting your hair around your finger while its still wet, then put some sort of mousse/ style product and let it air dry. Also brushing gets rid of curls, but if your hair is naturally dead straight your not likely to create curls without using curling tongs or something like that!|`|jEt3eugsaa	You can curl it with a curling iron and spray afterwards with hairspray. Or you can scrunch it. WHen you get out of the shower  take some curling mousse or gel and you can scrunch your hair.

Wash your hair the next morning, and make sure you got all the olive oil out! your hair might still smell a little like olive oil but it will be really smooth and soft.
UbrN5yytaa	Your hair won't become dry if you use a heat protection spray. I recommend Tresemme Heat Tamer Spray which protects your hair from the heat of both your hair dryer and your flat iron.<br>  You will also want to deep condition your hair maybe once a month. This restores the moisture to your hair making it shiner and healthier.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you use a heat protection spray.. thats the best way to decrease the damage. Also, a high end straightener will help :)|`|a49Musptaa	yup|`|baEs4ZcJaa	Yes it will. Try using moisturizing shampoo/conditioner.|`|QMLjVAMWaa	well, it can make it dry if you do it every day. to protect your hair against the heat, use a straightening spray and use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. (I use the pantene kind, it makes your hair really smooth!)<br>  another way you can make it straight without straightening it is if you blow dry it with a round brush, or just a regular brush and have the blow dryer right next to the brush as your drying. also put a smoothing cream or a frizz cream in your hair too to give it the look like you straightened it, and you should also have a heat-protectant spray in your hair b4 you blow dry so you don't damage your hair. <br>  <br>  when you start using a straightener every day or every other day in a week, then your hair will get dry in about a month or two, or sometimes it will take even longer. if you keep straightening it you might fry your hair, so get it back to being healthy by using a heat-protectant spray b4 you blow dry or straighten and use a repairing/moisturizing cream in your hair. <br>  hope this helped :]|`|9GKoMctXaa	No, I straighten my hair everyday and it isn't dry.

fH8Sr6Cjaa	You sound very hot!! :) I think that both styles would attract different types of girls. It seems like you want the more preppy popular girls to think you attractive am i right? I think both looks are HOT! Maybe add some nice smelling cologne and the girls will be ALL over you!!<br>  Good Luck!! ;)|`|8vDXwiMTaa	i say both just go for what you feel like on the day<br>  <br>  and if that doenst work dont dress like you couldnt be bothered to choose what to wear or that you tried too hard. i say wear casuall but cool clothes e.g. ... t-shirt, cargo shorts & skater shoes. <br>  i am sure it will work out fine<br>  <br>  just be yourself<br>  <br>  xxx|`|ASmWqy0jaa	Um the beach guy, but dont wearflip flops.

DjakP1bcaa	I highly doubt it. You need a product that wil give "weight" to your hair, and growing it out, unfortunately will not do that. Try Clay treatments, henna, and curly hair products. If your hair is anything like you described, you would probably have the most success if you invested in natural based products marketed towards biracial/black people. <br>  <br>  You would really have to experiment to find what works best for you. As odd as it may seem, many people with your issue apply rhassoul clay, bentonite, or kaolin clay to their hair along with moisturizing ingredients so that their hair will temporarily be weighed down (look up on youtube). Try mixing plain yogurt with coconut oil, coconut milk and henna. Apply this mixture (it will look like mud) to your hair for 4 consecutive weeks, and see how that works for you. It should weigh your hair down, detangle it, work as a awesome conditioner, and you can also experiment with color (it's a natural dye). As a curly product  try mixing aloe gel (Fruit Of The Earth) with coconut oil in the store..or try IC Fantasia gel. The best references are black women with natural hair on youtube. They have many concotions that they have found worked well at "weighing" their hair down.|`|VyPIMvDfaa	I'd say it might look like Jim Morrisons.<br>  honestly, it all just depends on your hair. its hard to say since everyone is different.<br>  my guess is that it possibly might look liek Slash's hair <br>  seeing as how he has basically the same situation aas you :]<br>  <br>  (im guessing you prolly know who that is, but iif nott, you could also do a google search) :P

uGdw3W2Faa	i hate it when that happens!! it used to happen to me a lot! i think it's some kind of conspiracy or something! :)<br>   anyways, i would wash it A LOT, (4-5x a day)maybe use a clarifying shampoo if you have it. dish soap works well too. just be sure to deep condition afterwards. this make take a few days to fade, but it should eventually. it might have a red tint to it|`|OMKDEun3aa	yes dish soap or liquid laundry soap put on for 15 minutes rinse then cond. after  if you put 30 on it it will lighten it more at the roots|`|b8UF80zXaa	dont wash it more than twice a day like someone said just wait itll get lighte with time bt if u cant wait then put some oxygen peroxide in it it will lighten it dont put the developer alone itll do nothing and itll damage ur hair
qroOTyrGaa	I love Clinique's High Impact mascara. A little tip: buy a metal eyelash curler if you don't already have one and heat it under your hairdryer for about 5-6 seconds and then use it. It will curl your eyelashes a bit more making your lashes look longer.|`|kj507W26aa	Everyone's eyelashes are different.  What works for me may not work for you.  Eyelashes are different in texture and length. So just use your own judgement and go for it.|`|i055TKXfaa	Try Telescopic Lenghths from Loreal.<br>  It's PERFECT if you are good at applying or just do it carefully.<br>  Real Lenghth and Thickness.

VZI8vm3Iaa	I am going to base my answer on an assumption of an extremely conservative church as some catholic parishes are stricter than others. It is better to be more conservative rather than too casual when making a first impression.<br>  <br>  You do not necessarily need to wear a dress or skirt; a pair of nice slacks (aka not jeans) would be acceptable. You will need to have you shoulders covered especially IF the Catholic Church you are attending is actually a cathedral (some cathedrals will not let you in unless your shoulders are covered). If you wear a dress bring a shawl to cover your shoulders and for warmth as some churches can be cold.<br>  <br>  Also if you are wearing a dress or skirt it should not be very short. Knee length would be appropriate, but shorter would not be considered conservative enough. The final thing I can think of  is that you shouldn't wear a low cut dress or blouse. You can always ask your boyfriend if an outfit you choose is conservative enough.|`|FI916ISFaa	You don't need to wear a dress or skirt.  Jeans and flip-flops are out though.  Any dress or skirt (except a cocktail dress of course) or any nice pants and blouse combination would be fine.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Wear a  casual dress with shoulders (not strapless or spaghetti straps) and regular shoes, not flip-flops. Or wear a casual skirt and summer top that has shoulders.|`|82A8E4yzaa	well i am a Catholic - i go to mass on a sunday..and i wear what a i like...<br>  <br>  i don't mean like outrageous club outfits[but that's just common sense] or really bright clothing that is very short.<br>  <br>  You don't need to wear a dress or a skirt...you could wear trousers....last week i wore my red cardigan with a white top underneath ...skinny jeans and my white flats...<br>  <br>  The priest will not look or be disgusted if you wear trousers...<br>  <br>  ADVICE- wear what you like...|`|8iQFdkIhaa	don't wear anything too short, or too low cut.<br>  just wear dress pants/skirt with a nice sweater or something.

tGGVeW3yaa	It takes about 4 weeks to grow back properly I should know I did the same thing.<br>  Just use fake eyelashes in the mean time, there really easy to put on and you can use the same pair about 3 times.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	The same amount of time as it takes your eyebrows to grow.  They'll grow back.<br>  <br>  Use tweezers next time.|`|AA11461724	oh my! my mom did something like that to me once, when i was like 5 years old. she was cutting my straight bangs and she got too close to my face and cut my right eyelashes AND my eyebrow! it took like 2 weeks for my eyebrow hairs to grow back, and maybe a little longer for my eyelashes to grow back, from what i remember. i don't think it will be too noticeable though. good luck!|`|c26Ae2y1aa	Try putting Vaseline on them overnight. It made mine grow super fast in a couple weeks.
tGGVeW3yaa	It's your bodies natural growth process that makes your hair grow at it's own speed, so theres no shampoos etc.. that will make it grow any quicker then it is now.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	Soak and wash with raw eggs..|`|YBSDSSaxaa	yeah the stuff I used for a show to get longer hair was called Mane and Tail.  It made my hair grow about an inch in 3 days.  Also, Vitamin B and B-12 is proven to help with growth and with hair health. Good luck!|`|TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|UIF7OBuxaa	Mane & Tail, yes it works, but it also makes your hair very thick, so if you have thick hair already I do not suggest it.<br>  <br>  Wal*mart or really anywhere that sells vitamins have Biotin, you can take up to 5 a day, these along with a healthy diet will help your hair grow faster and healthier.|`|EN9zc3SBaa	i never really heard of using horse shampoo but maybe it does work.<br>  i suggest if you want it to grow long fast try it but if you dont care how long it will take try triming your hair every couple weeks or month. it will help cause the dead ends with be gone and it will be health.|`|FIkJmy0haa	howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution

I had them a few years back and I looked awful and had to stay that way for a few months. If you think you should go ahead. But, if you don't like them, you have to wait a very long time before you can get your hair back to normal. If you try and cut them short they just grow back again.|`|ZVBQydLfaa	Well, it would really help if we got a picture of your face to see if they go.<br>  But the best thing to do is have a hard, long think and just imagine yourself with bangs.<br>  Maybe print off a picture of the exact bangs you want and give them to the hairdresser so she has the idea.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped!<br>  <br>  Dani x|`|77A0tlKtaa	well it depends on your face shape sometimes if you have a really round face bangs can make your face look fat! lol<br>  But I really like really straight bangs that just skim your eyelashes one thing that really doesnt work is when they are cut too short and curl up its really not attractive!! Hope I helped!! : D|`|AA11461724	what i did when i wanted bangs was i grabbed the longer hair around my face and kinda held it up to my forehead, where the bangs would sit. i didn't like how it looked so i didn't do it! try it, it will give you an idea of what it will look like. good luck!|`|WJJ18mE8aa	Well, I got bangs in the past, when my hair was shorter, (shoulder-length) but now my hair is MUCH longer, and I'm a brunette too, and I think that bangs are totally cute if you can work it. I don't like them on short hair, I think they are much hotter on longer length hair. If you get them just above the eyebrows, then you can curl them inward at the tips a little, and you can straighten the hair. It looks so much cuter when the bangs are thin and wispy, and the hair is soft, straight, and long. <br>  <br>  *I love this girl's hair.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	I am not black, but I do have really curly hair. :) If you want to run out and pick up some products locally, I recommend trying the following:<br>  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo<br>  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel<br>  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)<br>  <br>  These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online. Currently a lot really like Kinky Curly Knot Today and Curling Custard.<br>  <br>  Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

hDzjpF62aa	If you go to a local beauty supply store and buy a thinning razor, if you don't know what it is you can ask the clerk and it should only be around $7. Once you have it your problem is really easy to fix, bull the razor a bit on some paper or something, then get you bangs and hold them away from your face, then just brush down from around the middle of your bangs with the comb part. you might want to start kind of low to get a feel for the razor and then once you've got it just thin them how you want them, you can also use it to do the rest of your hair a bit if you want. Just remember that the biggest thing is get used to the razor so that you don't take huge chunks of hair out, start low and in a spot you know you want to get rid of.|`|adRCzGtTaa	<a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/brookelle%20bones/SAO-x-SUSHI/Brookelle%20Bones/Brookelle_Bones41.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/brook...</a><br>  <br>  i would just go to a salon and get them fixed<br>  don't even try to fix them yourself because you might make it worse lol|`|kIbReU80aa	Go get them fixed at a salon!|`|66b5bc1d43679f832ad9aac6cd2007d1aa	^ i agree go to a salon.<br>  they will fix it for you.<br>  =]|`|0NGedxvXaa	Go to a salon
bvIGLmfWaa	Home remedy for damaged hair: cover the hair with mayonnaise, sleep with it throughout the night and wash in the morning.This is the treatment my grandmother use afther she got a perm. I use it myself everythime I have hair loss problems or damaged hair. It is kind of emberassing having eggs in your hair.... but hey it is really great for the hair.<br>  <br>  Mix honey and eggs and put on hair for 10 minutes, then wash.<br>  <br>  Take one egg:<br>  <br>  Separate the egg yolk from the whites.<br>  Whip out the whites.<br>  Mix some water with the yolk and put in the blender until its smooth.<br>  Add the whipped whites.<br>  Wash hair with hot water and apply the mixture on hair.<br>  Massage and wash with cold water.<br>  <br>  Or if you want something more modern here are some advices:<br>  <br>  Option #1: The simple fix<br>  You need a deep conditioner, stat. Look for a product that contains keratin and is labeled for dry, damaged hair. Run product throughout hair and leave on for several minutes. The product will absorb into your hair shaft and soften your hay-like strands. Time it takes: About 10 minutes, not including the shower. I suggest deep conditioning twice a week the first couple weeks, then continue once a week.<br>  <br>  Try not to wash your hair every day, water is very drying to hair (not the shampoo). If you take a shower but opt not to wash your hair, protect your hair with a shower cap.<br>  <br>  Suggested deep conditioners by price:<br>  Cheap<br>  ALBA BOTANICAL CONDITIONERS<br>  Average<br>  Joico Joico K PAK DEEP PENETRATING RECONSTRUCTOR FOR DAMAGED HAIR<br>  Steep<br>  BUMBLE AND BUMBLE DEEP TREATMENT 5 OZ<br>  Option #2: Bring in the blowdryer<br>  For this fix, you need a conditioner with cetyl alcohol, according to colorist Robert Ramos in the August 2006 issue of InStyle Magazine. "It's an ultrarich fatty acid that helps hair retain moisture," says Ramos. A great conditioner is Kerastase Masquintense (I use this and it's great). Comb conditioner through hair then blast is with a hair dryer for 15 minutes. Rinse.<br>  Option #3: The complicated (but sure) fix<br>  I love this recipe shared by celebrity stylist Chris McMillan in the April, 2006, issue of Allure magazine. (You may know McMillan as Jennifer Aniston's hairstylist/best friend).<br>  <br>  Step 1: Mix in a bowl 2 tablespoons each of rinse-out conditioner, a leave-in conditioner, a deep conditioner and a hair mask.<br>  Step 2: Comb the mixture through clean, damp hair making sure to focus most of the product on mid-shaft down to the ends.<br>  Step 3: Wet 2 large towels, wring them out and heat one in a microwave for 1-2 minutes (depending on how hot your microwave gets the towel, you want it tolerable to touch, but steamy warm).<br>  Step 4: Wrap hair up in the hot towel while you heat second towel in microwave.<br>  Step 5: Alternate wrapping hair in towels about 2-3 times.<br>  <br>  This ultra-deep conditioner should be repeated once a week.<br>  <br>  Best hair masks by price<br>  Cheap<br>  Johnson & Johnson Neutrogena Triple Moisture Deep Recovery Hair Mask<br>  Average<br>  Phyto Hair Masks<br>  Steep<br>  Kerastase Nutritive Hair Mask<br>  Option #4: Cut it off<br>  It may sound crazy, but cutting off damaged hair is the only way to truly repair it. To keep hair in great shape, get a trim every six to eight weeks and swear off razor cuts, according to stylist Garren in the August 2006 issue of Allure magazine.<br>  <br>  Also stay away from any processing, which will only weaken hair further. According to Allure, relaxers are the harshest on hair, followed by bleach, permanent color, demi-permanent dye and then rinses or glazes. If you have damaged hair, opt for highlights instead of all-over color and ask your stylist to use a glaze instead of dye if you are going darker. For camouflaging gray hair, stil with demi-permanent formulas. <br>  <br>  Hope it helphed!|`|O0D1V8OPaa	use moisturizing shampoo.<br>  or a shampoo for damaged hair.<br>  also, try some after shower hair products<br>  that protect your hair from heat.<br>  i use L'Oreal Studio Heat Seeker.<br>  it helps frizz too.[:<br>  <br>  also,<br>  if you still need to straighten your hair,<br>  go to a local beauty store and pick up some<br>  CHI Straightening Spray.<br>  it protects it from the heat too.<br>  <br>  it's amazing.[:|`|DhcQC9DBaa	go to the hair stylist and have them take off all the dead hair, i had the same thing once, and i waited to long and lost all my hair, thankfully i had enough sense in the end to cut it all off. and i grew it back and it is just as good as ever now.|`|4v5JhXT8aa	just get a nice cut|`|KBLyOQdCaa	when u take a shower after that comb  ur hair and let it dry if that doesnt work cut ur hair|`|u18GBKmiaa	You should use a hot oil treatment on your hair it makes it really soft.|`|c0e153120e16cf5881dd153a30d4ac3baa	Best way to get rid of damaged hair is to cut it short.

So I guess all the bikers that are actually gay, really aren't since they're masculine. And all the gay people that evidently dress up in frilly pink tutu's just need to wear something more masculine to become straight.<br>  <br>  Grow the **** up.|`|uhnPQA9aaa	and where does the merchandise fit, unless you have a small package...:(|`|GgaaTG3Eaa	um I mean this is the nicest way possible, but if anyone sees you in them you will be labeled guy.

They cut their clothes lean and long so they fit those of us who are adults with young adult taste in clothes but who still have small frames.  Forever 21 is also a good one, though their "small" varies.

UbrN5yytaa	I have used both but I prefer Garnier Fructis better.. I'm a big fan of their products.<br>  But honestly, shampoos work different for different people. I would buy a small bottle size and test them both out.. Herbal Essences might work for your friend but it may not be the best shampoo for you.|`|pS02JGTUaa	herbal essence.<br>  garnier makes peoples hair greasy and causes a lot of build up :P<br>  and herbal essence never failed me, plus it smells amazing!|`|2V87n4PKaa	everyones hair is different<br>  buy both, use each for a month, and see which one works better|`|S1SaQnFGaa	I use both!

Just make sure its something that you don't care about staining.<br>  <br>  Another thing you could try is to put Vaseline on your skin where the dyed hair will touch, such as your forehead, ears and neck before dying your hair, to keep the dye off your skin.  Just make sure not to get it in your eyes or ears.  You might also consider covering your ears with something that can get dye on it.  That way the dye gets on the Vaseline or whatever you use and not the skin.  When wipe the Vaseline off after you've applied all the dye.<br>  <br>  I know that this looks funny, but a way that you might consider keeping the hair off you face is to flatten it against your head when you are finished applying the dye and find something to use as a little hair cover like a shower cap or make one out of saran wrap, just never cover your face, just your hair.<br>  <br>  You might also consider having a special towel or something that can get dye on it to wrap around your shoulders like a cape before you dye your hair.  That way it doesn't get on your clothes and it gets on your neck less.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|9n8EQWDnaa	i'm fair and dye my hair black, so you can imagine my skin gets stained every time. i use roux clean touch hair stain remover. works every time. moisten cotton pad or cotton ball.|`|PZukkBzOaa	Ashes from cigaretts.

Also keep the length because long hairs in right now.  just get a trim|`|AsM4tYMYaa	Get bangs straight across your forehead,layer your hair,and color it with either red low lights or blond high lights, depending on which way woul want to go.....it soungs a little funny but trust me it looks reallycute!
BThdUonXaa	it's really cute. get black if you want more professional and want to blend in. and get blue if you want to be unique, but it might not match everythign.|`|2H76RyP5aa	I like the black, but the Blue will be different (unique)|`|QwbOCHSTaa	I'd say black.

a7G0SyDaaa	Oh my gosh, please don't start cutting different lengths like the other person said!!! If you MUST cut it yourself..It really depends on the length of the layers that you want. Depending on the length, you would use your very bottom length as your guide.<br>  <br>  <br>  Gather and comb the hair upwards on top of the head and secure with a rubber band - like a ponytail on top of the head. <br>  Comb the ponytail straight up, all the way up and hold it there. <br>  Take the scissors and, cutting straight across the held up ponytail, cut off around three or four inches depending on the length of your hair. <br>  Pull out the elastic band and give your head a good shake - it really works and it will look great. <br>  <br>  <br>  Or try this one. <br>  You can have your hair wet or dry, but wet hair is usually easier <br>  Toss your head upside-down, like you're bowing and get a pair of scissors and cut straight across. <br>  <br>  Option 3 <br>  Dampen your hair <br>  Have your hair combed straight <br>  Determine your shortest layer <br>  Pick up the top layer of your hair (use a thin amount, you don't want it to appear chunky) <br>  Use your fingers as a guide and cut unevenly but naturally across <br>  Put in as many layers as you want depending on your hair length <br>  To style your hair you want to apply a route pumping cream to the ends of your hair (starting about two inches from your scalp) <br>  Then Pin up all layers <br>  Release bottom layer and blow dry <br>  Slowly release each layer one at a time drying each.|`|9YUmSw62aa	all you need is a scissors.<br>  <br>  start cutting different lengths all over the place.<br>  <br>  i do it and it turns out perfectly<br>  =]<br>  xox|`|2F4vkfnxaa	use sissors.<br>  but don't cut randomly<br>  i did that and my hair is different lengths everywhere but not in a good way.<br>  just go section by section<br>  and cut evenly|`|v9uESkIDaa	hi, i looked up this video for you, i hope it helps!<br>  <br>  if your hair is curly: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46-O8sYFSk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d46-O8sYF...</a><br>  <br>  if it's straight: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eoBYsZJuxc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eoBYsZJu...</a><br>  <br>  those ones are the best i found but there are more in youtube.com just type in layered hair and there they are! good luck!

AA10803040	Either go to a salon or have a friend shave it for you. Trying to do it on your own is a BIG no no. <br>  <br>  If your parents won't care, surprise them.

UbrN5yytaa	I've used the Chi and I don't like it... it gave me a lot of split ends and didn't last long either. Didn't have a heat temperature setting either.<br>  For the Solia.. I've heard that it stopped working as well after a year. The Hai.. I haven't heard a lot of stuff about that.<br>  I currently own a Sedu (1") and I bought it off of folica.com for only $84. It's amazing and works really well for my hair. It made it so shiny and soft everytime. I also use a heat protection spray along with that.. I would wait until they have their spring sale and you can get $20 off. Yes, I know.. a wait but hey, why not wait until the sale so you can get a better flat iron for less?|`|TZ1zTrq3aa	GHD GHD GHD GHD GHD GHD!!! ITS THE BEST EVER!!!!! I LOVE MINE SOOO MUCH!!!!<br>  <br>  www.ghdhair.com|`|A3UVbX2Eaa	HI!!! Sedu is definitely expensive, but they work very well (my friend has one). On the other hand- I have the CHI. I think it works wonders. My sister has the BIG CHI because her hair is long, and I have the original one. Personally, its just as good as the SEDU. My hairdresser at the top salon in my area (DASS) uses the original CHI as well.<br>  I have had long hair and used my CHI and it works great! Right now I have shoulder length hair and naturally I have curly hair- I would say that it takes me about 20 minutes to straighten. <br>  The good thing about the CHI one inch over SEDU is that you can use the 1' to even curl your hair. My sister and I have had our CHI's for about 4 years, and they still work great! <br>  I havent heard great things about the Solia nor the HAI. I think that they are just average. The CHI is amazing and I think all my friends would vouch for it. Also the silk infusion that ocmes with it is great too!<br>  The CHI company is also very helpful if you feel something is wrong with your straightener.<br>  Good luck!

Basically just go to Leicester Squ. with the tube and when you come up go to the exit by Shaftsbury Ave and go towards all the Chinese Shops, you will see it on your left.. you can't miss it, because there are loads of Hello Kitty things in the display window - I think the shop is just before Subway and there's an internet café near it too..and a pub like Wetherspoons is further down that street. Also go to Camden and Harrods for Hello Kitty. Topshop have a load of Hello Kitty sweets right now, lollies, individually wrapped marshmallows, pez sweets. They are over by the pic 'n mix on the ground floor near the Jelly Belly beans. H&M have body washes and lotions in Hello Kitty decorated bottles and make up bags, and Claires have little things like necklaces and bracelets (but none of them are very nice).<br>  <br>  I use this website: www.katzwhiskas.com for getting Hello Kitty plasters :) You can get some really nice things quite cheap in the sale section, and they also deliver very quickly.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	Artbox! <a href="http://www.artbox.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.artbox.co.uk/</a> They do a collection in Topshop on Oxford Street plus they have a shop in London.

zW8tc64qaa	Here's an easy solution to an irritating problem. Tell them to back off and respect your personal space. I know how hard it is when you are nice and don't want to be too assertive to the point of using physical means to get a point across, but sometimes it can't be helped. If they do it again, grab their hands and move it somewhere else. They should get the hint by then.

d7rRWo9daa	bought it about a month ago. It gives you some good natural recipes you can make from supermarket products to stimulate hair follicles and has different techniques for increasing blood flow to scalp. Also has things you need to take out of your diet lifestyle and vitamins you need to include in your lifestyle.  also talks bout proper hair care/washing techniques<br>  <br>  the jumpstart part of the program has some recommended products such as the multivitamin and shampoo/conditioner and other products.<br>  <br>  overall, it was pretty good information, and i'm using one of the recipes now. the info seems to be helping my hair to grow much faster this past month. For $20, I'd say its a very good buy if you're looking to get hair growin a lil faster.

Rj08Nzv9aa	use mouse or spritz when your hair is wet you could even try gel when your hair is wen it will give it extra hold|`|4PdTxuxgaa	before you curl, use a mouse like herbal essences totally twisted and run it through your hair then curl it. and it helps to spritz some hairspray on each individual curl (or every 3 at least) after your finished with them. then at the end of the process, spray the whole head. and just carry some hairspray with you for touch ups. <br>  btw make sure you don't curl your hair too much bc it'll really ruin you hair. like two days ago i curled my hair with an iron which i haven't done in months and now i have 3X the amount of breakage. so always use a heat-protector. <br>  =]|`|M5Sa85Ssaa	I feel ur pain lol i have long hair and it never curls, but my bff has this really nice curling iron its called hot tools <a href="http://www.hottools.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hottools.com/</a> heres the website and it curled my hair perfectly and it stayed in i even cheered and it still stayed in!.... hope i helped|`|YDDWUSIuaa	when you curl your hair,<br>  hold it longer with the curling iron.<br>  <br>  and use hair curling products,<br>  like herbal essence totally twisted, etc. <br>  <br>  hairspray: use bed head hair spray!

rqP6zoxsaa	you should Tease your hair with a comb and that will volumize it. If not you should use hairsprays, mooses and all your other products that say Volume or Body on it so your hair isn't so flat.

cXIxw5MPaa	To have great curly hair:<br>  <br>  1. Shampoo & Conditioner= Make sure to use shampoo and conditioner that is specifically for curly hair. I would recommend the Fresh Curls line by Redken, however, it is a bit expensive so instead you might want to opt for the Totally Twisted line by Herbal Essence.<br>  <br>  2. After coming out of the shower, I would use mousse BUT NOT GEL because many gels contain a high concentration of alcohol which damages hair. For mousse, I would recommend the the Totally Twisted Herbal Essence as a mousse, or Kinky by the brand Got2Be. <br>  <br>  3. When applying mousse, literally run your fingers through your hair with it. You really should not need more than two palmfuls of the mousse. When you run your fingers through your hair like this, it makes the curls smaller and more defined, and the appearance of greater volume. It can also make hair look longer. AIR DRY!!!<br>  <br>  Also, remember that hair can react in different ways to the weather.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!!!! :)

It would look natural and refreshing compared to your edgy look now.|`|FCGBPVHwaa	your hair goes with you but if you are going to put blond in it i suggest to change ur hair color to a brown n get some highlights! it would looks nice!|`|CadIYXdXaa	I know it's not the answer you want, but I'd keep it the way it is now. It's gorgeous.|`|lgyAUd2oaa	I love your hair the way it is.

But you could work blonde, the great thing about blonde is if you don't like it you can just dye over it.

LBHJaqXoaa	Love handles in the off season shouldn't affect the way a rib tattoo looks. If you gain or lose more than 50 lbs, it will distort the tattoo but as long as you only fluctuate 20 lbs or so then it should be fine. If you want one, go ahead and get one. It will still look good even though you put on a little weight in the off season.|`|gu0AxKyiaa	you should be good, i mean like 15 pounds in a week wont be good but ya dont over do the eating|`|LYxCuCWhaa	I would not suggest getting your tattoo on your side. If you balloon up and down with your weight a lot, it will most definitely stretch out and become distorted. If you still want the tattoo and are willing to get it somewhere else, why not your spine? It'll hurt a little more than ribs (which are, by the way, seriously painful--personal experience) but it will look just as good.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12032352	I don't think a little belly would make a side tattoo look bad.<br>  <br>  Sure it might look kind of silly on a really big person....and if you think you may gain a lot of weight someday....ie....you struggle hard with your weight or your dad is really big....then you might re-think the location.|`|YyOSSuHvaa	sry about the love handles but just get teh tattoo if you want it who cares. and i would never tell ppl not to do sumthing.

Nupv5Uzlaa	It isn't good for your hair.<br>  <br>  Here's what I do, and hopefully it helps:<br>  <br>  After showering, I put in a straightening balm or some such product in my hair and comb every so often.<br>  I left it dry naturally for a little bit, then I blow dry.<br>  After blow drying, I blast through my hair on the cool setting to reduce the left over heat.<br>  <br>  You're going to be straightening you hair anyways, blow dryer poof will go away anyhow.<br>  Sleeping on wet hair just makes it harder to straighten, as it can get wavy and hard to manage.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped some!|`|DTNDhwljaa	well for a start, its not good to wash your hair more than twice a week, it dries it out! :) so that should solve your problem for 5 nights! as for the other two, i would say dry it as much as you can by squeezing a towel around it and then it wont be too wet when you are going asleep. its not particularly bad to sleep with damp hair, however, it will make you chilly when you are sleeping. a better alternative would be to have your shower early in the evening, so it has time to dry. hope all this helps!!! xx|`|dE8edvGIaa	When i go to bed with my hair wet, in the morning, it's going everywhere and is crazy, when i let it dry while i'm awake, it dries straigh.<br>  Also there is a risk of catching a cold and having your hair fall out.<br>  I also heard that it increases your chances of getting nits somehow :/<br>  and it does make your bed wet and its fairly bad for your hair in a way.<br>  hope i helped.<br>  x|`|2O7lYgRpaa	i don't think that it is bad for your hair but you may wake up with it looking weird because you slept on it funny.

You could try leave in conditioner that might help with the blow drying thing.|`|KkbDMM0waa	its no too bad<br>  but i find it easier to <br>  wash your hair at night<br>  blow dry your hair<br>  then straighten it<br>  then in the morning your hair wont be too poofy or wild<br>  it works with me<br>  try it<br>  <br>  :D|`|ne2ltUKwaa	It doesnt do anything to your hair. its like leaving your hair wet durning the day. theres nothing different going to be with it wet. so dont worry.|`|YZdBvUeKaa	yes it can cause breakage and damage your hair.|`|HxxdKRPHaa	Yes...you wake up with a sore throat and a stuffy nose...it doesn't feel very nice.|`|szWjzTgwaa	u cud get a cold|`|0AQF8pnKaa	no, the only time you might not want to do that is when you have a cold. it's better to let your hair naturally dry out because applying too much heat (because you straighten it) can be really damaging to your hair.<br>  <br>  hope this helps! :)|`|Z4PxfObXaa	People always say that you will get sick if you go to bed with wet hair.<br>  It's just one of those old-wives' tales.<br>  For a few years, I did that every night, and no, I did not wake up sick every morning.<br>  It's perfectly fine.<br>  It does not damage your hair or your health.<br>  The only reason I stopped sleeping with wet hair is because I now wear it naturally curly, which means I have to wash it in the morning.<br>  If I go to bed with it wet, it falls flat on the side that I slept on.|`|B3uvhA7kaa	I don't think it's bad. A lot of people do that. Ironing your hair is bad if you do it constantly. Gives you split ends and dries up your hair. If your hair puffs up when you blow dry it (like mines), put some frizz control spray or change up your shampoo and conditioner for something that has anti-frizz.|`|RR35cmBdaa	i don't know how anyone can go to bed with their hair wet i hate it i always have to dry my hair when i come out the shower than i straighten it then its fine in the morning well helps as i have Straight hair anyway so does not take long to straighting it|`|tg0RIjMTaa	my mom said if i sleep with my hair wet i will get a headache,  but I never really got one before.|`|M3pufPlnaa	If it is it's 9:20 pm and I just finished washing my hair :)

ne2ltUKwaa	what you should do is, die your normal hair black, then get blonde extensions. itll look cool. :)
V7WyjxUSaa	Looks good. I think you should. It's nothing but extensions anyway, and you can remove it if you didn't like it. Wouldn't hurt to try. Your haircut doesn't really look that bad.
k2P7LkWgaa	i cut my bangs myself,<br>  my bangs were to my jawbone and i cut them and now theyre a little past my eye and look much better(:<br>  just cut them a little bit each day-if you cut it all at once, you could mess it up and then not be able to fix it<br>  hope i helped(:|`|Ky1yadlfaa	My bangs are to my jawline--you could try getting a nice layered cut to them, or use pins to keep em back. Only problem is pins look kind of bad. Why dont you just cut them? if you like them long, use hairspray to do a whispy over-the-eye look. guarenteed to freak people out if u have dark hair :3|`|YL5qH6FYaa	You could cut them yourself, I do it all the time. Do it right when you get out of the shower. Or you could get them cut by a professional.|`|WCNsmyZBaa	Cut em|`|syitFmPvaa	you can get them cut or grow your bangs out and part your hair differently
Vy8p3Qlcaa	The third one.|`|EL45UeUJaa	I think that the blonde would look to over done. I would say the first because of how you tan really dark, or the last (i realy like that color) would go well good with your skin and brown eyes :D|`|2F4vkfnxaa	in between the first and third.<br>  what color is ur hair now?|`|630336a3ecdd24935bc2cf3a7830f278aa	it would help if you had a picture of yourself<br>  but i think the first or last would look good<br>  the middle one isn't dark enough|`|5U6w3hfTaa	The first

hMF3kg3Baa	I think that it is a beautiful dress, so I say yes. But you are the one that has to wear it. So the decision is goint to be up to you.<br>  Good luck and have fun at your prom.|`|RTojCgVPaa	it's a cute dress and it's really cute on people who are pale. i would go with a neutral maybe pink lip gloss and a silver eyeshadow with black eyeliner slightly extended on the sides. if you have dramatic eyes don't go with dramatic lips if you do it's too much and you'll look super tacky.|`|vlCWp7sSaa	That is a very pretty dress. I love the color and the uniqueness.|`|FBGMKdqKaa	Do it up with a red lipstick and winged eyeliner - YES!|`|SzZxgHdtaa	Gorgeous. I think that it looks very nice.|`|83y9Vu5oaa	I LOVE THAT DRESS!

You'll really turn heads and it's a gorgeous dress! but make sure you get amazing shoes! shoes are very very important! And what's great about this dress, is that you can accessorize with reallly nice jewellery and bag/clutch. I would say silver, but it's up to youu!! don't go for a darker colour cos then you'll look tooo dark, and your paleness will be accentuated too much, but if you go for a colour like silver then it'll highlight your dress and complement your colouring!!! =D <br>  <br>  HAVE FUN!! my proms soon tooo!! WOOHOOO!! good luck!! x<br>  <br>  oh and just saw shoes the model is wearing.. they. are. amazing. if you can, get exactly those shoes!! lollllll as you can see, they are perfect! so have fun and i think you should go for that dress! =D|`|JdpVNgyxaa	I think you'd look gorgeous!<br>  Deep colours like that go REALLY well with pale skin, the contrast makes it seriously stunning.<br>  <br>  The only thing that worries me is that it's a little long and i'm not really that keen on dresses that are kindof in-between lengths. But if you like it, go for it!<br>  <br>  The colour will definately suit you!|`|pRCLV8Xcaa	really cute dress and i love the shoes|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	its a cute dress.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Totally!!!!  What a great dress!
1p0bWVKGaa	Go to the doctors and have them recommend you to a dermatologist. If your having spots its probably liver spot, dry skin. And could be because of the weather!|`|1IJp17Eeaa	Depends if it's due to dry or oily skin, you just have to experiment with products and see what's best for your body. Also make sure that you aren't over using any products, for example; exfoliants are great but should only be used once a week otherwise they can anger the skin and make spots worse.<br>  <br>  Another thing you ought to look at is whether you wear a necklace or touch your chest a lot. If you fiddle with a necklace or if it's made of cheap metal you could be reacting to it.|`|2LUa46c6aa	i was always told to use coco butter. and sum1 esle told me lemon juice.
ne2ltUKwaa	i prefere you with short hair. you suit it more. and it makes you look more grown-up.|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	short! its super cute!!!!! :D|`|7FIe6xBAaa	i think you suit both.<br>  the short looks neat, but the long is cute.<br>  you could keep it short but get some extensions that sit below your shoulders. <br>  then you could switch between long and short when you feel like it.|`|CxDZT8FJaa	Let it grow back out, I would even let it go longer it was so pretty when it was longer and I am sure look even prettier as it grows longer, just keep ends trimmed to keep it healthy.|`|EM5rQOGBaa	log suits u , but must say they don't look like ur real hair , look like clip in hair to me , ( am nt being ***** wen say dat it jus i have clip in's that look very lyk dat )|`|44RpLWb7aa	i like your hair better long.|`|k2P7LkWgaa	i like it better long, but it still looks really cute short(:|`|xpcoUTYyaa	The long hair makes me wanna stick my tongue in your mouth.  You still look good though.  Usually the shorter the hair, the older girls look.|`|ie8sIDhJaa	i think you look older with shorter hair,<br>  but longer hair looks better on you<br>  maybe that is just because it is curly though?|`|7USZbMdoaa	wow you're really pretty<br>  i like it longer it looks nicer
HzjeKsDJaa	its in the west end<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|7cUDstdjaa	Many of the stores in the West End and around Picadilly have them.<br>  All airport shops do and the shops at Waterloo Station|`|9E9h5WWwaa	the internet.|`|3bbBBMNnaa	you can get team GB  stuff from here i know its a dog agility site but the GB clothing is not agility related<br>  <a href="http://www.agilitywarehouse.com/product_detail.cfm?id=1636" rel="nofollow">http://www.agilitywarehouse.com/product_...</a>|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Train in a sport and join the olympic team.|`|dWjANfQXaa	What sport ?

18808f59be0629a2599099e8e0d72801aa	probably just a really cute white top that fits you good.Maybe you could wear the waistcoat over the top|`|83y9Vu5oaa	i think just a cute white tank from a&f would be cute
pNoCq63daa	if you can't decide.  you can always let it grow out until you decide.  i heard that if you grow out firzzy hair, it gets less frizzy. but if it is suuuuuper damaged, i would cut it off and get a fresh start!   gooood luck|`|TczFL0p0aa	I would go and ask the hair stylist to cut off a little bit of your ends, to get rid of the damage so it will grow slightly faster [this usually means an inch is taken off] not to much, usually not even noticable! and if i were you i'd try to straighten only 5 times a week (so only weekdays, like myself, i found it made a difference!) and hair products and certain shampoos, salon products are expensive but well worth it, if you cannot afford that then i would try herbal essences, they smell amazing and work fairly well!<br>  good luck!|`|11zPDTJ8aa	Cut it short. Short is really popular and easier to maintain. Keeping it trimmed short will control the frizziness. I recommend you cut it as short as your courage allows.|`|AA11314125	GROW GROW GROW|`|xmPauFy6aa	stop straightening it immediately! then let it grow out.|`|sOCLwxnFaa	cut it short x]|`|xv3opX9Maa	let it grow <br>  long hair is way better <br>  just get some good frizz cream or serum <br>  ( =|`|gy2S2ENOaa	Cut it a little bit, to get rid of some of the damage.  DON'T STRAIGHTEN your hair as much.  I know it's hard, but that's what I had to do in order to make it look a whole better later on.  You will be glad you stopped, and while you take a break in straightening, you might develope new ways to wear your hair.  Gell, Pony tails, barretes... reall there are so many sollutions!!<br>  <br>  try hair products too

657kKxnYaa	I think those hairstyles would be a bit to risky. It sounds like you and I have the same hair type. Try a shorter hair cut but not as short as the 1st picture. (short hair+curls=a mess).

zpt0D7Znaa	If I was stuck in the mud last thing I would do is try to accelerate out. If I was that stuck accelerating would just result in the tyres digging further and further into the mud. I would certainly not bother screaming at the car as this really wouldn't achieve anything. Unless this is some time in the future, my car would unlikely have any kind of voice controlled getting unstuck from mud device. I would attempt to free the vehicle myself with possible pushing and a gentle relaxed approach to accelerating.<br>  Fortunately for me I know a vast army of Land Rover driving beefy men that could rescue me from the mud situation. If had been driving a Land Rover at the time I would be unlikely to be stuck, if I was driving a lesser 4x4 there is a good chance I would be stuck. The Tata Gurkha is the best example of a 4x4 that will get stuck in a muddy puddle, they are useless. We once spent several hours trying to get it out of a slight patch of mud. In the end we had to build it a road from twigs we found in surrounding area. Land Rovers are generally the way forward in mud stucking prevention (freelander excepted) although getting stuck is possible in serious hardcore situations. We have a Range Rover classic that doesn't get stuck unless my other half is seriously punishing it.<br>  On an unrelated note I once got my foot stuck in the mud.

kCdISEGqaa	Good thing you came here to ask complete strangers what to get!  You'll get some great responses here.  Why didn't you just go to a shop and say what should I get?  We love it when people come in and say, I want a tattoo, but don't know what I want, what do you suggest?  <br>  <br>  A tattoo should be thought out before you go, and your decision should be final.  I am not saying make it have some deep meaning to you, not all of my tattoos have deep meaning, but, I knew what I wanted before I went in.  Don't rush into it just to get another tattoo, please.|`|JduQHocdaa	You need to decide this on your own it's going to be on your body permanently.|`|bg86ji6naa	why would you just get a tattoo for the hell of it. You are gonna regret that when you grow up and mature.|`|tX27e0UFaa	tattoos on the bottom of anything like a foot or underside of your hand wear off to fast. I am going to get a pretty asain scene for a full sleeve when I get my other job and leave this one. I am excited and love tattoos. You should think of something you are into and would like for the rest of your life.. something colorful and pretty.  not the cd cover you are into right now but somehting that symbolizes the year you were born... I am a tiger. ..or if you are into astrology get your symbol for that.<br>  there are also a lot of choices they can give you.  go hang out at the tat shop for a little bit and ask around there!<br>  good luck|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Get your favorite flower. I love my flower tattoos and they look feminine and will never be overdone or cliche. <br>  <br>  You could also get your astrological sign tattooed on you - that is something that will never change about you. <br>  <br>  Or you could just get something that everyone else is getting, like stars, cupcakes, or skulls.

I would suggest (only if you enjoy astrology) to get a tattoo of your astrological symbol on the back of your neck, or lower (so it won't show with all clothing) between your shoulders.  There are an infinite number of ways to design each symbol and color to match your personality.  This would be a personal tattoo that expresses yourself along with your personality type.<br>  <br>  Hope this idea helps, but I have many more.  Just ask|`|ZkrGttKaaa	The variety of things in tattooing that people think is 'cute' is absolutely staggering. People get everything from gummi bears falling down their leg, to small men with lawnmowers, right above the pubic hairline. What is cute to some, may not be to others. Your best bet is to go to the studio where the work will be getting done, and look at flash (pictures) on their computer screens and walls, along with their portfolios, to see which artist does what you like the best. It'll give you more ideas than I can possibly mention.|`|ulsg8E8gaa	hey <br>  i dont know if your into astrology or anything like that,<br>  but ive had a lot of people want me to tat their sign<br>  depending on where you go to get it done, you can ask the tattooist if they could add their own little twist on it or something (with backgrounds of a tropical flower; skulls; starts whatever you want)<br>  it comes out looking really good and people are always satisfied<br>  <br>  it would just be one of those "hey this is me" tats<br>  <br>  lol<br>  i dont think your crazy, getting a tattoo is a way of expressing yourself!<br>  =)<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  i hope you find what your looking for|`|vMo017hNaa	I think a tattoo on the bottom of your foot would be cool (though painful).

7RUqEJzLaa	3 shades lighter of dark brown is definitely not platinum blonde. So I'm not so sure if that would be a good idea. Maybe dye it dark blonde or a lighter brown and see how that goes. If you are still set on having platinum blonde after that, wait a few months and get friends and family members opinions on platinum blonde hair. We don't know what you look like so we can't say if it will suit you or not, but that type of hair color can really wash someone out.

TfJn3KJvaa	Hair typically grows 1/3 of an inch every month no matter what but if you take good care of your hair you can grow up to an inch a month.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking hair, skin, and nail vitamins, available at any drug store or wal-mart. Things to look for are vitamin B complex, vitamin E, and biotin (vitamin b7). Eat healthy and get plenty of protein and dark green vegetables. Hair is mainly composed of protein. Eggs contain a ton of protein. Also foods containing "gelatin" are good for your hair such as yogurt and jello. Google "hair growth foods" for ideas. Also try daily scalp massages using your fingertips to stimulate hair growth, it gets blood flowing in your scalp and feels great. Avoid frying your hair at all costs. Get plenty of sleep and excercise, especially cardiovascular excercises like running. Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and stress. <br>  <br>  A good conditioner is also important. Sunsilk is amazing and cheap, the kind I am currently using contains jojoba oil wich is AMAZING. Any sunsilk product is amazing and cheap.<br>  <br>  If you have fried hair, do not dye it anymore and try hot oil treatments, and do not use shampoo every day. I leave contitioner in for about 5 minutes before washing it out to keep mine looking healthy. If you have split ends get them trimmed to avoid it getting worse.|`|FIkJmy0haa	howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution|`|MG8MwZrIaa	Is it still long enough to pull it back into a cute little poney tail?

SiUV6P5Kaa	Ok so first post a picture so we can see your hair.<br>  <br>  Make sure you washed your hair really good. Shampoo Your hair twice. then rinse and add hair conditioner and  comb or brush your hair with it throughy and leave it in for a minute and wash it off. you dont have to wash your hair but thats what i do to get the best results. do not blow dry your hair! brush or comb it down and keep dowing it until it dries by itself. You need a good straightner too. like a herstyler brand. cheap kinds will give you split ends. (Cheap = $0 - $75) And When your hair is dry. brush your hair until its all going down but not infront of your face. grab a BRUSH and get on peice of your hair. put the brush at the beggening of the strands, then get your straightner (250 Degrees or higher) and put it infront of the brush and slowly pull both of them down and if neceserry repeat only one more time. and once all your hair is straight. comb it or brush it to the style you want. i guess you want it infront of your face straighten then down infront of your face.<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: Your hair WILL look kinda poofy. like hairs are sticking up. dont restraighten it. its like that when its hot so just let it sit for 15- 30 minuts and brush it and it will be silky smooth. and dont put any hairspray or sheen spray on|`|AA11314125	Iron it only|`|lyuWTIo6aa	lol..that last part had me laughing ..but its not too hard..i know some guys that straighten their hair..and i have really thick hair so it takes just a little bit longer.. but just take small strips of you hair one at a time..and just straighten it..slowly..redo it a couple of times.and your good..its not hard at all trust me but if you go on youtube. it would deff help you a llllllooot!!.type in how to straighten hair and it will show you how..!!welll gooood luck =]|`|haR4lEhlaa	I'm guessing since you're a guy, you've got really short hair. My advice is to go to a beauty supply store, like Sally Beauty, and get a chemical hair straighter. I've used the Zotos 3 Month Hair Straightener and it works well. So if you want straight hair but don't want the hassle of using a hair appliance every day, this is the way to go.
ky9uJSHPaa	Heyy<br>  Okay I'll try to help you.<br>  1) First, go to a professional salon and get a small trim or whatnot. Over there, ask them what you can use to tame your hair. You said when they do your hair, it goes perfect right? So ask them how do maintain it.<br>  <br>  2) About the frizziness, you need a good serum. There's a couple by Paul Mitchell that work pretty well. But I'd suggest an extra strength one, because it seems your hair gets VERY frizzy. Maybe try Bedhead, Garnier Fructis, or Herbal Essences products. Or Pantene? Ask a professional salon-ist what would work best.<br>  <br>  3)Try using super sleek products/shampoos. I know there's a "dangerously straight" line of shampoos by Herbal Essences. Try those. They won't make your hair curly. <br>  <br>  4) Try thinning your hair. It will definitely feel much lighter and might help a lot. Ask a person at a salon<br>  <br>  5)If all else fails, you can try getting a perm. But I'd advise getting your hair cut first, like thinned. That way, your hair will stay straight and you can curl it. <br>  <br>  6) Maybe you just need a better straightener. Possibly a CHI? I've heard those work well. And they're ceramic so they don't damage your hair.<br>  <br>  Hope I helpedd =)|`|nv6wlhIlaa	Don't wrry if your hair gets greesy after 3 days..its actually good for your hair because your hair is dry and that may cause the frizziness<br>  <br>  *Wash your hair<br>  *condition your hair<br>  *Appy an even amount of leave in conditioner (if u have more hair put more)<br>  *Then apply anti-frizz serum<br>  <br>  You can always put in more conditioner during the day to keep away any frizz if u would like.<br>  <br>  Thats what i do and my hair stays perfectly by my side, no fly ups.|`|FNTeLbIuaa	Put in leave in conditoner before you straighten your hair. that should help with the frizz.

It sucks the dye right out, but you can't get it on your scalp, you'll get major burns. <br>  <br>  Or go to a hair dresser. They can get it out for you. <br>  <br>  I've dyed my hair at least ten times a year for the last seven years. Most of it was bright colors like orange, blue, pink, etc. But I know why I'm talking about. Good luck.  If you have any more questions email me at animeaddict2515@yahoo.com|`|DajJGlgtaa	You can buy a hair colour stripper at most drugstores ,<br>  and it strips the colour from your hair , leaving a reddish tone .|`|r8hBvWEQaa	use really harsh shampoos like men shampoo and it will strip the dye out quicker|`|eFW05AOUaa	Oh my Gosh that same thing happened to me.!!! no joke!<br>  I washed it out with dish soap! i know that sounds wierd, but the stuff you wash your dishes with, i used that and washed it really well.

0AQF8pnKaa	-the hair should at least be an 1/8th of an inch before you can wax it off.<br>  -it should cost about $20-$40 depending on the quality of the salon you go to. and about $10 for a kit at kroger or wal-mart.<br>  -it shouldn't hurt as much as getting a bikini wax or your pits done. on a scale of 1-10 (10 hurting the most) i would say about a 4. it gets better the more often you do it though.<br>  -it will not cause irritation, in fact it's way better then shaving<br>  -no it doesn't matter that you're 14 (i started when i was 13, but i'm a girl), and more and more often these days men are going to salons and getting waxing done.<br>  -get your underarms done, i'm not really sure about your pubic hair, i don't think they'll do mens pubic hair.<br>  -underarms hurts wayyy more<br>  -you can find a waxing kit at kroger, wal-mart or any drugstore<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10295707" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.target.com/gp/search/181-0324454-2837639?field-keywords=waxing+kit&url=index%3Dtarget&ref=sr_bx_1_1&x=0&y=0" rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/gp/search/181-0324...</a>|`|7sA8HwTzaa	1.  The hair needs to be at least about 1/4 inch long to wax it off<br>  <br>  2.  Cost will vary dramatically from shop to shop.  Call ahead and inquire.  When you find a price you like, make your appointment.<br>  <br>  3.  It will hurt, but I really don't think it's all that bad.  Maybe that's just me, though.  It goes away very quickly.<br>  <br>  4.  Irritation is another variable.  It depends on how sensitive your skin is.<br>  <br>  5.  Yes, your age matters for the pube waxing.  There is no way that a guy should be doing that for a minor girl.  Each shop probably has it's own guidelines about age for the rest of it.  Ask when you call about the price.<br>  <br>  6.  Waxing any area of unwanted hair, legs, underarms, pubes, or moustaches, will help diminish hair growth each time until it eventually doesn't grow back.  This is especially true of your legs as the circulation there is generally not as good.<br>  <br>  7.  I've heard legs hurt more, but I think it's because it's a much larger area.<br>  <br>  8.  Sally Beauty Supply sells waxing supplies.  There's a gazillion of those sugar ones, but as you know, they really do not work well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qlgsyv2Laa	heres one thing... IT WILL HURT!|`|s17neRQbaa	ok dont wax ur legs bc my frend did and they came out bad it will hurt so shae|`|uvnQBS6iaa	OK, well I am sure there wont be a problem with getting them done.  Cost varies from place to place so shop around.  Leg waxing really does hurt, but it is nothing compared to having your underarms done.  There is always a bit of irritation and exfoliating and moisturising are the way forward to help this.  I wouldn't bother having anything else done though.  Apart from the cost, there is really no need.  If you plan to do it yourself then there are loads of DIY kits in any chemist or supermarket, so you can pick what you want.  Good luck!
eqxrSzNgaa	If your style is earthy, vintage, indie, then you should probably go with a short black or red dress. Or if you go with earthy then it could be a long green or dark brown dress. Either way you can add some white pearls and look awesome! You should curl your hair a little, or make it wavy. You can also add some little pearl earings!

1E1m0ZOFaa	Well you can buy Hair removal cream from avon, it is the best and it minimises hair too. With it i suggest you buy hair minimising cream with it, you would probably have to use it three times a day after using the removal cream, but it really does work and it's the best. I personally find avon's hair removal cream, it literally works in 2 minutes|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	Waxing will last over a week, a lot longer than shaving. Waxing works better if your leg hair is left to grow then. That makes it easier to rip out. You could also try a hair removal cream, such as Veet, which is supposed to last about 2 weeks. Some people get dry irritated legs from these creams though, so test a small patch of skin before you use it on your entire legs.|`|AA12302838	they ahve lotion that slows they hair growth I've used it before I got iot from avon I have to shave every 2-3 days it sucks but it makes your hair lighter and not so thick|`|e3f1f67b63d6ed1fb938ad6fe4172be1aa	I have increased testosterone levels, so I've always had problems with hair. If I shave my legs, I've got about 36 hours before I have to shave again. When I wax, it can take as many as four weeks before hair is at all noticable, and possibly longer before you have to worry about covering it up as it tends to come back more sparsely, finer and paler. Here's a list of options covering what I've found. To wax effectively, the hair needs to preferably be 6mm at a minimum - but longer is better.<br>  Waxing is the number one option, but also the most painful. You can do it yourself or go to a beauty salon. <br>  <br>  Waxing yourself: The first option is pre-prepared wax strips. With the strips, you tend to need at least two boxes, not one. Regardless of what the box claims. It starts off cheap, but multiple boxes add up. I use to buy three packets of re-useable strips and it was usually enough for a thorough wax. The second option is buying wax that you heat yourself and use similarly to at a salon. If done right, this is actually quite cheap, however it's more effort. If you can be bothered learning to do it right, this is the best possible cheap option. <br>  <br>  Waxing at a salon: My personal favorite, however also the most expensive option. In it's defence, it lasts the longest, and over time it makes less hair grow, and what is there is thinner and less noticable.The optional extras cost more though, like bikini line, g-string or brazillian. This'll leave you completely smooth for maybe 2 weeks, and then it comes back really thin for the next few weeks. Economically, most salons recommend for waxing to be repeated every 6-8 weeks, as by this stage most of the hair has come through<br>  <br>  Hair Removal Creams - the less painful option. I've tried most brands, and though some tend to be better than others, I've never found one that completely worked. These get most of the hair, but quite a few strands stay in. Of course, then if you shave afterwards, the leftovers aren't noticeable, and you don't have to do it so often. Combining hair removal cream and shaving any exess is probably the cheapest way to keep hair gone for any length of time. Try to find a hair removal cream that uses a sponge or scrubber as opposed to the ones that use a scraper. I've found the scaper's tend to leave way too much hair behind.<br>  <br>  Also - your eyebrows. Get tweezers and learn to pluck them between waxes. Make sure you pay attention to the shape, and a decent pair of tweezers makes the job half the trouble and half the pain, so don't skimp; buy a good one.

jGqZdS2xaa	Well it might be a little expensive but these are the steps to make your hair healthy and get rid of the split ends. First, go to a salon and have about a half inch of the ends trimmed. The split ends will be gone just like that! Then, the salon should have some kind of deep conditioing treatment. If they do, get that done. It will make your hair healthy and soft. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|CXgPkEPFaa	cut it off to let it grow back|`|fBINcqIZaa	I just went to get my hair trimmed at the hair cut place and now i don;t have any more split ends|`|hep8pA7Gaa	what do you mean by damaged?<br>  well for the split ends, just go to a salon & have them trimmed

UWTkdG6uaa	i have the same problem but these tips work for me:<br>  <br>  When you blow dry your hair make sure you point the airflow down (i used to dry my hair upside down which roughens up the cuticle making it go frizzy)<br>  To stop static spray, hairspray on your brush before brushing through.<br>  Silicone serum is good, apply it to damp hair then smooth a little more on after you've finished straightening, avoid using to much product up as the build up does make your hair go greasy.<br>  Aloe vera works really good on frizzy hair too, use it in the same way as serum.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|oVGOW3xPaa	Static sheets?|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	when you brush it, spray hair spray DIRECTLY on the brush and then brush it with that, it will calm fizziness! :)|`|2D8y8Fohaa	well, every ones hair is a little different but i know how you feel with the weather our hair can certainly disobey us!<br>  what i do in situations like this is i always blow dry my hair i use mousse and a conditioning product so my hair doesn't become dry.  try to avoid hairspray and flattening your hair will water... if you go to a salon you could also ask for an anti static and anti frizz shampoo or something along those lines.. for something cheap herbal essences offers those products in stores. <br>  also it's best if you clean ur brush out before you use it. that could cause static in your hair!<br>  good luck!|`|ur68myedaa	dont brush it first. i know that sounds weird but it works for me i go to sleep with it wet and then when i wake up its all messy and curly. then i straighten it and just kinda run my fingers through it to seperate the really bad pieces. good luck :]|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It's static-y because it is too dry.

eh1k5vg8aa	It is normal to loose up to 50 hairs in one day, your hair goes through stages, growing, resting and falling out stage, and all your hairs on your head are at defferent stages at different times, so it could be just that alot of your hairs are going through the falling out stage and are starting to grow back.  That is if that has only been going on for a couple days, if it has been longer it wouldnt be that going on.

Tho... have you got a flu/fever lately? like maybe a week ago... my doctor said it was probably from that, and it's really usual for teens to do that. Another thing is if you have discharge, like not from your period... that could be a side effect from a flu/fever... <br>  <br>  Well hope I helped, oh and try this, when your hair falls out check if it's coming from the scalp, or just part of your hair... I'd say if it was coming from your scalp go see a doctor.. if it's not, then don't. <br>  <br>  OH AND this only if your losing aLOT of hair... the other people are right, like you lose 100 hairs a day.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4c2YoX1Xaa	mayb u have servere  dandruff....have u tried conditioners.especially during the winters dry scalp is a biggg issue.if it doesnt get better yes see ur doctor!! another thing are u stressed..stress is anotha factor!!|`|1E1m0ZOFaa	Oil doesn't actually make your hair greasy not unless if you don't wash it our properly, What i suggest you to do is get some olive hair oil, use it about 2-3 times a week. Put it on at night and wash it out in the Morning, don't ever have it on over a day! The use some hair repair shampoo for dry/damaged hair, i would recommend the elvive one. It will take time to work but the results are wonderous!

DQOIf98faa	You need to either relax it again or cut it off.<br>  The weight of the relaxed hair is conflicting with your natural which is causing it to fall out. If your going to keep relaxing it whenever your combing your fingers through your hair and feel new growth that means you need a touch up of the relaxer.<br>  If your going to cut it off. You dont have to cut all your hair off just a half an inch above the relaxed hair.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

dvwiToU6aa	It's human hair, so do to it whatever you would your own. Both Shampoo and Conditioner are needed to keep your extensions happy and healthy. After you've finished shampooing and conditioning, make sure you comb them through so they don't dry ratty. You get best results when you blow dry them, or so I found anyway. When I had them, I never washed them as often as I washed my own hair (every day) But I did it every 2-3 days instead. Hope this helps. x|`|ltnXWIpNaa	Use both, just don't put conditioner near the hair extension bonding's, if they are keratin or micro links, it can cause the hair extensions to slip or loosen.|`|YDDWUSIuaa	you actually use whatever you would use<br>  for your hair,<br>  like shampoo and conditioner.<br>  <br>  but make sure you use conditioner to <br>  make it softer.|`|iHC5mSLEaa	wash it like you wash yours.<br>  <br>  usualyy shampoo & conditioner x|`|FIEGlhoWaa	use shampoo and conditioner

It hasn't lightened it but it has helped it to look less inflamed.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Avoid washes as these strip away natural oils which actually causes skin to produce more oil which clogs pores, instead try cleansing with Oil Cleansing Method (OCM) which maintains natural oils keeping skin healthy so prevents acne. For OCM mix half extra virgin olive oil to moisturize and half castor oil to cleanse, also try adding a little tea tree oil which is antibacterial. Massage into your face then put a hot face cloth over your face for a minute to open pores, then wipe off oil, any trace amounts are absorbed into skin so won't be greasy. <a href="http://www.moogoo.com.au/category13_1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moogoo.com.au/category13_1.ht...</a> Most natural living people I know use it, we all love it as it's really great for your skin and prevents all sorts of nasty skin conditions like acne.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	water and gentle exfoliation.  see your dermatologist.|`|AA11963278	Tea Tree :)<br>  <br>  It is soothing and treats spots and other nasty stuff well.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_wash" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_wash</a>|`|826a85d5cffb6532b3bf8f657b3a42e9aa	Lime juice and rose water|`|b00ba3d721ffac4d935c0a5f7cf8bd76aa	Clean and cool water- THE BEST.|`|mye6DFRAaa	i think all citrus fruits|`|AA12026167	1)  Stir together 1/2 cup cold milk and 1/2 tsp. of salt.

In less-preppy girls, the longer hair looks much better.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|zoTdLkJTaa	depends on the face shape <br>  <br>  it has to suit the face and frame it nicely|`|cMk2siviaa	i like both, but for some reason i think longer is sexiier|`|6x2cRz7naa	short!|`|OvzA0SHqaa	it really depends.  im sorry my answer may not help that much, but it really matters what type of hair you have and and your face.  I think that a layered medium-long length looks good, especially if your hair has different tones.  Ask any friends that you have, but don't sound vain or girly.

yP9qx2f9aa	Wearing it curly will make it look shorter, but if it covers up the mistake then it's a good option!<br>  Try throwing your hair into a ponytail or messy bun- that will definitely cover up the style!<br>  Using a headband or some clips also might help.<br>  The more you use a straightener or a blowdryer or any type of heat on your hair, the longer it will take to grow out.<br>  <br>  Also, some hairstylists will fix a bad haircut free of charge.|`|TczFL0p0aa	it depends on the person but for it to fully grow back i will say at least 6 months to a year, you could try curling it also playing around with how you part it could help!<br>  good luck!|`|oA8fEliTaa	when you tie it up mousse your pony tail wich is a really cool look especially when you put your fringe into a quiff ........................................... look|`|AA11314125	get a indian crow|`|xmPauFy6aa	try for the britney 09 style. sort of medium length-ish. maybe add a more heavy side bang. it'll take at least 6 months-1 year to grow it back.|`|ExW7J0Ypaa	yeahh, i think curly would be good, only at the ends though, not all over, because that makes you look like a poodle... not good!<br>  <br>  :) x|`|rhPwtpxBaa	Include a pic?|`|gy2S2ENOaa	what you already said is a perfect sollution to your problem.

If you're just entering the business, and you're asking for help over the internet, anyone could say they are in the business and you could get yourself in trouble. Also, when you say you are open to 'pretty much whatever', it could be taken the wrong way. Just be wary.<br>  <br>  Your best bet, if you think you can get into the industry, is to get a friend or family member to take some photos of you and make a small portfolio. Then, take this to nearby agencies and see what happens. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!! x|`|AofhDwkmaa	Hello.

P1UTKXvPaa	steps<br>  Shampoo and condition your hair. When finishing, do your last rinse with cold water.<br>  Squeeze the excess water out. Towel/air dry for 10-15 minutes. Divide hair into 3-4 sections. To scrunch it, scrunch your hair from the ends going upward to your roots (like scrunching a piece of paper), once you're at the root, secure with a hair clip/claw. You want it damp but not soaking wet or dripping.<br>  Wrap your hair in a small towel (for thin hair leave on a few minutes, for thick hair up to 20 minutes). Do not rub your hair at all with a towel (this will cause frizziness). What you can do is scrunch it gently within the towel if the ends are still dripping.<br>  Run your fingers like a wide-tooth comb through your hair and make a part as best as you can. Don't worry if it's not perfect!<br>  Use hairspray. Put it near the middle and bottom of your hair. Putting it too close to your roots will cause it to look greasy and weighed down.<br>  Turn your head upside down so that your hair is hanging down. This step is optional and some prefer to skip it. Helps give volume and a more even scrunch.<br>  Put gel/mousse in your hands and rub them together to spread the gel/mousse.<br>  Grab a small handful of hair by the ends and push it up toward the head. Hold it in place for a few moments while aiming the hair dryer at it to 'set' the gel/mousse/hair spray.<br>  Repeat this all over your head, reapplying the gel every time. Keep in mind that small handfuls yield tighter waves and large handfuls create full, loose waves.<br>  Leave hair alone while air-drying if you opt to not blow-dry with a diffuser. If you mess with it too much it will cause frizz.<br>  Do not rush the steps or rush to dry it. Letting it dry by itself is a way to leave it with a wet look.<br>  Spray an even amount of spray wax at the middle and ends of your hair for more texture (Pantene Texturize! is great).<br>  <br>  <br>  tips<br>  If your hair is fine or hard to tame, it's always good have hairspray on hand. If it starts to go flat, re-scrunch hair by following the steps you do before drying hair. It works great!<br>  Make sure you don't look like a wet dog! use only a little bit of gel.<br>  Fine/thin, naturally straight, or chemically-straightened hair may be resistant to scrunching. If this is the case, apply curl-defining mousse or gel to the hair and curl it using a barrel iron. Consult the Related wikiHows below for instructions.<br>  For best results, use shampoo, conditioner, and products (gel, mousse, hairspray, etc.) that specifically define curls.<br>  Take a shower at night. Then apply the mousse and spray. Go to sleep with your hair still slightly wet. When you wake up, your hair will be wavy. To perfect it, get your hair slightly wet all over. Make sure you avoid getting your roots wet. Reapply mousse and spray and you're done.<br>  If it only works from the middle of your hair down, put it in a regular ponytail. (Only if it doesn't work all that well.)<br>  Make sure that your hair isn't completely dry or completely wet -- keep it damp. Always press your hair with a towel.<br>  Some say that adding a drop of honey to the gel brightens blonde hair and brings out the waviness.<br>  If your hair is straight, wet your hair and put it in a french braid overnight -- don't forget to use hairspray before you go to bed. Once you wake up take out the braids and your hair should be wavy. Scrunch it with mousse and hairspray, and your hair should look scrunchy. Or you may put your hair in a messy bun overnight(don't forget to use a little hair spray). If you do this, however, make sure hair is lightly damp, as opposed to dripping wet, so that it can dry in the braids overnight. Otherwise, when taking out the braids, you may find your hair hasn't stayed wavy, or won't for long.<br>  If you have thick fluffy hair, you can part your hair into two sections, twist it, and secure it with a bobby pin. Then spray on hairspray and let it dry. Take the twist out and then you will have natural curls.<br>  For a really awesome look, once you're done washing your hair, put gel/mousse in it. Then put it up and when you wake up in the morning, your hair looks fab!<br>  Don't even think about brushing it! It will just make it frizz, instead, use your fingers. You can't even tell if you have knots.<br>  If you have natural curly hair and you scrunch it it will make it more wavy or curly than it already is.<br>  To obtain more root volume try scrunching upside down.|`|AA11596611	I have the straightest hair ever and keeping curls in is so difficult. I try new methods constantly. One is to use a flat iron (like a chi, skinny and smooth) and make loose spirals with it. Another way that I have recently been using that works is to put mouse in my hair and curl it but pin the curls to my head immediately following the curling. I don't use hairspray because on my thick but fine hair it just weighs it down and makes me lose my curls. Good luck!|`|7Q3Rb0lIaa	Moose, gel, spritz, anything for curly hair. <br>  Dont put it on straight out the shower hair... it will just weigh it down, but let your hair dry natural just a bit, and then put your product in.<br>  <br>  Work it in like normal, then if you do not like the results still... get a defuser for the blow dryer. That is sure to do the trick.|`|aGQY0DNqaa	1) braiding it before you go to sleep<br>  2) using wax/gel/holding cream and putting it all over your finger and then wrapping chunks of your hair around it and hold for 10 seconds, and keep re-applying wax/gel/holding cream with each chunk of hair<br>  3) scrunch after you shower|`|ErpMx1ibaa	blow dry your hair with a round brush.|`|bthUZouFaa	buy some moosse for ur hair and after u take a shower put some on...not too much.....try it|`|h00bqU7baa	You should look it up on youtube.

You can use the same recipe and apply the oil on your hair. Process is:<br>  <br>  1) Warm the oil mixture about 1-2 tbsp. depending on hair length (see the vid for recipe) slightly for 30-45 seconds in the microwave. It should be warm and not hot!<br>  2) Apply on entire head in circular motions with your finger tips. Massage gently and please do not use your finger nails on the scalp...it scratches!<br>  3) Leave on the oil for about 45 minutes (Tip: you may want to slightly warm your head using a hair dryer atleast 6-8 inches away from the scalp in a circular motion, warm skin allows easy absorption of oil)<br>  4) Wash off with warm water, shampoo and then condition hair.<br>  Do this process once a week.  Also, see my other video on a deep conditioning yogurt banana hair mask.<br>  <br>  Eat 2-3 raw almonds daily, every night brush hair using a boar bristle brush (helps redistribute your natural scalp oil over hair and smoothen hair follicles).<br>  My you tube channel is jashu1980 link is here (remove the spaces before copying in the URL field):<br>  <br>  http : // www . youtube . com / jashu1980<br>  <br>  Let me know how it works for you.|`|MlhMXIrNaa	there actually is nothing you can put into your hair but if you eat loads of protein itll grow pretty long.. well m ine did.. it grew like 2 ft in a year! :P:D|`|YDDWUSIuaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw9KGN2IOq0&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw9KGN2IO...</a><br>  <br>  watch this video.|`|FIkJmy0haa	howtogrowhairfast.com is your solution

Some of the best ones are Sedu, Ozon, GHD, and FHI.. they all have a good reputation for their products.<br>  Make sure you look for a straightener with a heat temperature setting..The one downside about the CHI is that it doesn't have that feature and in my experience, it breaks easily.<br>  Also, make sure you are using a heat protection spray. I use the got2b Guardian Angel Flat iron spray and sometimes I'll use the Chi Silk Infusion.

And when I do hair, I also use some oil sheen. <br>  <br>  Perms in the end will damage your hair more than help, and the dryness is most likely just from your cuticle of your hair being over processed and not holding in the moisture. <br>  <br>  Blow dry if you can before you straighten.

Maybe you should change shampoo and conditioner, I use Herbal Essences , they're great because they have different types for everyone; like straight, wavy, curly etc.if not you can use pantiene it's also good.  All you have to do is probably wash your hair more often, maybe every other day. <br>  -Hope I helped :D|`|EMYImof1aa	it's puberty, just shower more often, wash you're your hair everyday and use a moisturizing shampoo that won't dry it out, if it gets too dry your hair will break|`|PuRpsENEaa	How do you smell the top of your head???<br>  <br>  Go get a special shampoo for oily hair, can be found at any drugstore.|`|jU0dGPzUaa	Your hormones are being produced.

sp9IaiDfaa	I just recently got my eighth grade graduation dress too! I got mine from Old Navy. Now I know it seems like an odd place to get a graduation dress, but it is perfect. They have cute little summer dresses and they are only 20 dollars. I didn't expect to get my dress from Old Navy, but I just stumbled across it. Or, you can get your dress from department stores like Macy's. I went to Macy's to get my eighth grade dance dress, but it was 70 dollars and fancy. And for a graduation, you don't want a fancy dress at all. <br>  Go to oldnavy.com  → go to women's → go to dresses → mine is the last on the top row.

We all shed skin cells. Some have oily dandruff and some have dry dandruff.A person with oily dandruff has overactive oil glands around the roots of the hair. This overactivity causes the natural shedding process to speed up, resulting in a crusty scalp, oily hair, and excessive flaking. For some people this problem even occurs on the eyelashes. With dry dandruff the oil glands become plugged, resulting in dull, dry looking hair and dry flakes of dead skin. This dry type of dandruff can be just as bothersome as oily dandruff.<br>  .|`|lMu2J3pNaa	multiple things:<br>  washing ur hair too much, which dries out ur scalp and causes it to flake<br>  <br>  not washing ur hair enuff, which leaves it oily and gross<br>  <br>  when u wash ur hair, u dont wash it throughly enuff, and the residue causes ur scalp to flake<br>  <br>  or just having a naturally dry scalp|`|i6jT4rpOaa	Dry scalp.

Also, excessive use of products such as gels and hair sprays or improper use of hair-coloring products. What causes dandruff too is excessive use of curling irons or hair curlers, low humidity conditions such as winter or dry indoor heating and finally inadequate rising of cleansing agents when washing your scalp. Finally, avoid any hair products that contain alcohol which can also dry out the scalp.

zpt0D7Znaa	Have you tried ebay? I've just done a search and there's 603 pairs of ladies shoes in size 2.5. The majority of these pairs are less than ￡10 including postage. The only problem is returning them if they don't fit. Some sellers will accept returns so check the listings before you commit to buy. Worst comes to worst you could always re-sell any shoes that didn't fit. I wouldn't advise you keep wearing size 3s they will only ruin your feet in the end.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|3bdb0c9980b9d24f0f88e2e1a0acfe3eaa	You could try European catalogues, some of them do Size 2s, a 35 in European terms.

New hair will take the color much faster than the rest of your hair.<br>  <br>  The most you can do with out bleaching it...<br>  Get a color stripper and start brand new... that will take you to your natural or close to it. (yellow box at places like Sally's beauty)<br>  <br>  Other than that... it willl just have to take its course. Wash or fade out after so long... Dont try to color again. Color does not cover color.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|KsZCI8cnaa	I also use brown/dark brown color and some areas turn black... The front is thinner hair and that's also the first area you apply it, so it stays longer. It will fade in a few washes, but next time I suggest on blonde hair, use light brown.

283tO9j9aa	Maybe put your hair up in a high ponytail and then curl it so the curls fall down from the hairband. Or you could pop some feathers into a messy bun.<br>  <br>  As for makeup, if you're okay at using liquid eyeliner or drawing a cat's-eye shape with a pencil then do the flicky bits with your eyeliner, perhaps use a dark or sparkly eyeshadow. If you use a dark eyeshadow just use lipgloss or leave your lips bare, but if you use a light sparkly colour or just stick with eyeliner alone then red lipstick is the way to go.

iRPomhW6aa	yes! i have like the same face shape as you and my bangs look great on me (or so i think!) u should get side swept bangs but don't get a fringe tho cause that might make u look like a coconut head! lol<br>  and ur rly pretty btw :D|`|uxLdK7yiaa	I think you have the face shape for it, but if you have naturally curly hair that you don't straighten all the time, then bangs might not been a good opinion for you. You could always try some long side bangs though.|`|WKAqqYXEaa	I think wispy bangs and lots of layers would compliment your face.|`|t0jhHCRsaa	I think you'd look good with really long thin bangs.|`|5y4pY97Laa	ya i think so i have bangz|`|FIEGlhoWaa	yea!|`|92fyzJkcaa	yeah like the ones on the side..|`|E2ludi7xaa	Yesss!!!! i would get side sweft bangs they would complemnt your face shape very well|`|skYqazEZaa	Yea you would look really good!

wuZXqYPGaa	ok everyone EVERYONE thinks that if you dont get regular haircuts every month that ur hair will grow more. that is completly false, if you never cut ur hair, they will develop split ends, and once u got mini split ends your hair follicles slow down their growth rate .so if you want long hair get small trims once in a while.. i was in a car accident and so i had to cut off lots of my hair, but i kept goin to get a trim and now i have my good ol long hair back, and i also bout some hair regenerater cream at the salon, they got tons of products that helps to increase your hair growth woot woot. good luck chickie|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massaging makes a lot of difference to the rate at which hair grows, so a regular massage  with any oil of your choice is recommended to speed up the process.

Use warm soapy water and a wash cloth/ And you needed to wait another month before weaing hoops. Just wear studs, take them out daily and clean them.|`|Sgm0RrMQaa	leave the earing in. don't take them out at all, use eye solution for contacts to clean your ear holes just drop onto the piercing and twist the jewel aroung gently. if you take the earing out it can get other gunk in it and it slows the healing by tearing and pulling on the scar tissue. and if you take it out it can close up and your infection will be under your skin and you'll have to take a needle to it.
YCxyqLsQaa	Chi.<br>  <br>   I have the same kind of hair. BTW: Dont ever cut your hair short. It just gets curlier and poofier. <br>  <br>  Paul Mitchell also has a good hair straightner. It gets hot enough and it lasts all day. But Chi gets hotter I think.<br>  <br>  And I also love Chi curling Iron. Because I dont even have to straighten my hair then curl it if I was big curls. I just keep my hair curly then I use the curling iron.<br>  <br>  Oh and Chi and the Paul Mitchell straightners are kinda pricy. <br>  And...There are ways to straighten your hair faster than others. You just have to figure it out by trying diffrent ways.|`|q2uZxyevaa	my hair is way thick so i have to use a high temperature straightener, currently i am using a remington and use herbal essences dangerously straight shampoo and conditioner.|`|dvwiToU6aa	A while ago I (cheaply) bought a pair of Charles Worthington Straighteners. I used to have very long and thick hair and because the Straighteners were thick plate they used to do my hair really quickly. The maximum heat setting is 200 degrees, but I'm unsure of the model name, they came with two bottles of Charles Worthington heat defense spray too! If you're looking into getting a pair of Straighteners, it's definately worth taking the time to look at anything by Charles Worthington! xx|`|Rj08Nzv9aa	you should get your hair blown out or straight permed to get it blown you will need a lot of heat protector and a very hot blow dryer|`|M5Sa85Ssaa	The chi|`|LehwOrSIaa	Chi or a Solia|`|h1OCYD7Gaa	I use one from revelon because I really dont want to drop 200+ on a hair straightner.

You need to get regular trims to keep the split ends away.  You should also use plenty of products to protect the hair.  I use Matrix Sleek Look shampoo, conditioner, and iron smoother spray.  I also use John Freda Frizz Ease Serum.  Also, for the little hairs that stick up after you straighten it, get some hair wax.  Put just a little on your hands and smooth your hair down.|`|zoTdLkJTaa	lol i do the same thing...EVErydayyyyy<br>  <br>  some tings to do to prevent/heal damage:<br>  <br>  purchase AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE at a drug store - its a deep mositurizing conditioner - it works great!<br>  <br>  and also, make sure u get a decent heat/thermal protecting spray for ur hair when u straighten<br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|syR7u648aa	i had the same problem!<br>  nothing works!<br>  eventually your hair will start breaking off.<br>  i got a bad haircut and they cut most of my hair off.<br>  but now its healthy<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry! but your gonna have to get it cut<br>  then getsome clip in hair extensions from sallys<br>  and no one will ever know (:

The only way you won't crease them is if you...<br>  A.  Don't wear them.<br>  B.  Never move anything from ankle height or below.<br>  <br>  If you want to March everywhere and keep your feet/toes consistenantly leveled with the ground, be my guest (you'll be in trouble if the ground is tilted even 1 degree, however, lol...very likely), but you'd look very uncoof for it.  Sure, your shoes would stay dandy, but people aren't going to say, "he walks really funny, he must have some sort of disorder...but, at least he wears neat shoes!"  They'll skip the shoe part.<br>  Sorry for bluntness, but there is your answer.  Take from it what you will.
upd7W9ZUaa	I think you should try it out. Your hair is a light brown so maybe you should go with a dirty blonde. OR just get some highlights they would look gorgeous on you. I love your hair! Haha.<br>  <br>  You should stop being a hermit you are young and cute, get to meet people and forget about being shy or stuff like that. I have an online crush on you. LolLol.

Try cutting your hair with todays styles, not the asian 80s style.|`|wohGR1Nkaa	You are very yummy.<br>  But yeah you would look great blonde.<br>  Bleaching can be brutal on your hair I would know.<br>  It would be very dry and brittle.<br>  So you would have to condition it ALOT with great conditioner. Might I suggest Aussie 3 Minute Miracle, great on my hair.<br>  <br>  Umm styles.<br>  You could instead of going all blonde just dye the hair at the back blonde like white blonde ish and then get some gel and spike it at the back.<br>  Would look nice on you. And I had a friend that did that and it looked great on him.<br>  =]|`|a1nUhQ56aa	First off your SEXY lmao and I dont think you should cut it and I think it would look amazing blonde.|`|vpmRRamKaa	just stick with what you have<br>  and be glad with the hair color God blessed you with<br>  even though i dyed my hair<br>  (l0L]|`|zMDnzS9Haa	i think a dark blonde would suit you, but not bleech blonde that would be bad.|`|TxEu0R61aa	Wow<br>  <br>  You're really hot.<br>  <br>  Yeah, sure that would look Sickk xD<br>  <br>  Bleaching dyed hair has risks - a friend of mine went from black to blond but at first it went a greeny colour, and then when she dyed it again it went ginger, but it's blond now.<br>  It isn't the best thing you could do to your hair, but any kind of dye will do something to your hair, like the nutrients and stuff, but tbh, you see all these "celebrities" who have dyed their hair more times than anyone thought possible, and they're ohkay [x<br>  <br>  Luu-Aleesh'<br>  <br>  xxxxxxx<br>  <br>  Thumbs down?<br>  Right - whatever.|`|9ND3K8paaa	I think you would look good blonde. and if it doesn't work out for you just dye it black again. as for a haircut, maybe just have a little trim but keep the sort of look you've got now, it looks good. =D|`|x3MPcnOHaa	i think it would look awesome blonde. xD<br>  but reeaaal bright blonde! <a href="http://s240.photobucket.com/albums/ff42/RiddlezTheJuggalette/Hotties/?action=view&current=BlondeEmo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s240.photobucket.com/albums/ff42/...</a><br>  like that. would be hot. :)|`|SzZxgHdtaa	Yes you would look ok blonde. But to be honest you suit dark hair better. Maybe you should just get some highlights in your fringe.<br>  <br>  Hot stuff :)|`|HWMXTF1Haa	no i think you'd look like some california surfer-wannabe with blonde hair.  stick with dark. <br>  <br>  <br>  PS you're hot.|`|9Ywbz5w3aa	hmm.<br>  I don't know about fully blonde. <br>  <br>  because you look kind of scene.<br>  <br>  so; i think that putting some blonde in your hair will make you look even hotter ;)|`|PS83gPGoaa	blonde highlight mayb not too blonde cos it will look trashy|`|dat8eoYyaa	ya u could pull it off|`|oJ5ztybGaa	Yeah thtd look hot.<br>  But it culd make u look more pale. u look relly good with brown hair, but i think blonde would look JUST as nice :]<br>  <br>  EDIT: omg i cant believe u dont get asked out alot.... ure gorgouse ;] <br>  and whats with the thumbs down?? lol. get out thr more maybe and girls will be all over yuH! idk wh ythey rnt alredy...?? <br>  <br>  OMG highlites wuld look hot, brown with blonde highlites.

KP0bps0kaa	Levi's are the ultimate, honestly. They're quite expensive, but totally worth it, they last longer than most other jeans, and don't cost that much more (about ￡60) and they never go out of style, they're a true classic, why do you think people still buy vintage levi's as well as new ones?<br>  <br>  <br>  Trust me :)|`|XWDNzHe7aa	Silvers! They have the perfect fit for anyone, and they're super comfy. I've had mine for quite some time and they have seemed to be durable, too!|`|4ixoMWcLaa	idk how "in style" they are.

Vx2hbHK8aa	The kit in!<br>  <br>  seriosly taper cut can sumtimes go bad!!
IV7C3QwRaa	With the growing number of people wearing weaves, black women may not have been the only ones who knew you wore a weave/wig.  You would be surprised on how many non-ethnic women wear hair extensions.  Don't feel insecure, if anyone asks, just tell them you were looking for a change (no explanation needed).  I'm sure you are quite beautiful with or without the x-tra hair, so flaunt it and be who U want to be...Good luck....|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Just tell them a few days in advance that you are going to go get a make-over and get your hair cut.

For nicer things like a Broadway show, slacks, skirt or dress would be appropriate with a jacket or coat.  Walking around anything goes but remember comfortable shoes or boots.  Also, spring is rainy time there so take a light weight water repellent jacket with a hood you can fold up in your tote bag,  unless you intend carrying an umbrella around.

6juV48RWaa	find some shampoo or vitamins that thicken your hair.
wLa4rKAFaa	Just lean back so your hair flows down, then starting from the nape of your neck, gather the hair upwards. Don't tie the ponytail too close the your head, make it a little loose.|`|EbhSbrt0aa	i saw an ad for this thing. um...whats it called...ill look it up then edit this answer. but you just like buy the one that most matches your hair color and it poofs your hair.
QKhpcAypaa	lol i was sitting in detention the other day .. and you know how wen they mark your of on the computer thingy ur ID photo comes up,, anyway mine come up and this like 30 say yr old teacher was like omg can you do my hair like that sometime ... and i laughed hard :]<br>  <br>  but yeh its cool when older people have scene hair.. as long as there not into hello kitty and hang around malls smoking till midnight and stuff like that... Get the hair cut :]|`|a2wZg7DQaa	no way! just dont go so shot with the top layers so it flatters your face more but go for it who says those styles should only be for teens!  just keep the layers not so short and it will look amazing :D<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|OehjuDxVaa	No, sorry :/|`|R7ACldBKaa	I would consider anyone out of high school too old for a scene/emo haircut...YOU ARE AN ADULT NOW, LOOK LIKE ONE.|`|NgAaenfuaa	no , just look like a normal 30 year old. And leave your hair the color it is.|`|CXgPkEPFaa	not if you have a personality to go with =]
4JMMuP9naa	after showering let your hair dry like 50%<br>  then put in some curl enhancing creme and either go to bed with your wet hair or blow dry on cool,<br>  then style if u need to by putting in mouse<br>  <br>  as for the actual hair-do<br>  her poof is not centered<br>  so take from the center -to the left side- of your bangs<br>  bursh it- so dont put any product in this section-<br>  and twist it under to form a poof/roll and secure|`|KR6pBFLVaa	Curl your hair with inch thick tongs, and then pin back the fringe in a side like quiff, and then hairspray to set.<br>  I can see how you had to ask a question on that. lol.
V2F8YCa2aa	That sounds cool. But you could sell things for your nails too. You know, like files, clippers, buffers, etc...|`|yG0XF83waa	I like it.<br>  I think you could expand it, though- make it appeal to more people.<br>  You could include other things like manicure/pedicure kits, cuticle moisturizers, nail files, clippers...<br>  <br>  I think it would be a good idea, you just might want to think of a new name. Like what someone else said, it is kind of childish (no offense intended) You would want more of a "sophisticated name" something that would make people remember the store.|`|QawQ2usdaa	Awesome! ut sell some other nail related stuff too! Oh, make sure it is near my housebecausee I paint my nails three times a week!|`|4VBoqt4jaa	it's definatly a good concept, but i would expand it to things that people use on their nails too. <br>  also, i would rethink the name. though Nailplish Land is catchy and cute. it is a little childish, no offense.|`|WkqagpZmaa	good concept.<br>  but maybe name it something different like,<br>  <br>  Nailed It!<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  simply polished.<br>  <br>  or something else. idk.
zxQT3Uo5aa	First what is everyone else doing?  You are doing this for yourself as well.  Then take away rent, utilities, food, clothing, school supplies, and recreation.  Whatever is left, you are due.|`|GUJ60P72aa	100 dollars or more + and you are a really good person. :D i have to do the same.<br>  <br>  isnt it tiring?|`|z8VRBWPDaa	100 dollars+|`|btnxm3Meaa	100+

Urban outfitters is generally considered quite a trendy shop.|`|w5l7De7Daa	boho<br>  <br>  GODDESS!|`|MJ5juxzpaa	vintage urban sort it's really unique i love it.|`|cwYGorpnaa	ugly....|`|C8p1RTuGaa	Indie/Vintage|`|rseG0xwvaa	sort of vintagy and natural...LOVE IT!! XD
usxeet5vaa	Since you're going horse riding, you're going to need to be wearing something that you are comfortable in, but at the same time, is trendy!<br>  <br>  Try a look like this:<br>  <br>  Colored tight, long, Vneck tshirt with denim vest on top with blue skinny jeans tucked into your boots. <br>                        <br>  If it's too cold for that, then instead of wearing a big old bulky jacket, try something more stylish, like a nice black coat with a gray scarf, and dark blue skinny jeans tucked into boots. <br>  <br>  Since you can't wear shorts or skirts for riding, and you have to wear boots, then you're going to be wearing jeans basically all the time because pants with boots...yuck! So, stick with jeans, but bring about 3-4 pairs, depending on how many days you're going there, and switch them around. <br>  <br>  You can also accessorize! You can't really do anything with your hair (except for braids or pig tails), because you'll be having a helmet, but what about scarves, necklaces, nail polish colors, bracelets, and bangles! Stock up on those and stuff them in with your clothes in yoru suitcase! Accessories are ALWAYS the most important to make an outfit look fantabulous! <br>  <br>  Another outfit idea is to wear a white full sleeved tshirt and a colorful lacey tank on top! With another pair of jeans, and of course, boots. <br>  <br>  Be sure to bring another pair of shoes to wear when you aren't riding- Converse, Nikes, Adida Sambas, Vans, or plain running shoes are all nice, but I really recomment bringing Converse because they basically look fashionable with any outfit. <br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!<br>  <br>  HAVE FUN AT HORSE CAMP!|`|Xq0dR6eYaa	ok i would reccommend hollisterco.com<br>  they have super cute jeans && long sleeve knit shirts<br>  also AH-d0rable hoodies. but if you'r smaller like me<br>  then i would reccommend abercrombiekids.com <br>  both are owned by the same company && have super<br>  cute clothes. :D <br>  <br>  hope i helped hun!<br>  have fun @ horse camp ;]<br>  <br>  ----xoxoxoxoxoxoxo|`|6CCBKW34aa	yeah, so you should definately get some skinny jeans for nights, grey and indigo wash, because those can get a bit dirty. For riding i would get I nice pair of bootcut jeans, i found that lucky brand has great riding jeans, also Ariat, they have good jeans and boots, and riding clothes. Also places like Anthropologie have adorable tank tops with thick straps that wont show a bra. Some sweaters, a cute jacket, and a belt will be all you need!
2JQDpcZ5aa	hey :) i think i can help :)...<br>  <br>  1. primer is stuff you put on before your makeup. there is face primer and eyeshadow primer. it makes your makeup stay longer, and go on easier. the eyeshadow primer helps the eyeshadow from creasing, and keeps the colors from fading. for face primer, i recommend smashbox photo finish primer, and for eye primer, i recommend urban decay primer potion.<br>  <br>  2. no, lol a base in not foundation. a base is basically the same thing as a primer, just extra protection. usually it refers to eyeshadow though. bases go over primers, under eyeshadow. mac paints and paint pots are good bases.<br>  <br>  3. if you have good enough skin, i wouldnt use a foundation. if you really want some coverage, go for a tinted moisturizer. but these are the steps- 1. primer 2. liquid foundation 3. concealer 4. and powder foundation to set it all. primers and bases are not necessary, but they really help a ton, so i definitely recommend using them.<br>  <br>  i recommend using mac foundation and concealer. its a little pricey if you are used to drugstore brands, but it really works wonders.<br>  i like the studio fix fluid for liquid foundation, and using a natural mineralized skinfinish for a powder. as for concealer, i love the studio finish one, its fantastic. this gives you amazing coverage, but you said you have good skin, so you may find you dont need all that coverage. so, like i said before, i would either just stick to a tinted moisturizer (which is basically liquid foundation mixed with moisturizer. it gives a sheerer finish), or just the mineralized skinfinish. and i already told you the primers i recommend under numbers 1 and 2!<br>  <br>  so i hope that helped! and hopefully cleared some things up for you :)<br>  xox, bella :)|`|AA11333546	Primer IS the base.<br>  The primer just makes your skin ready for the foundation and it makes it go on nicer, smoother and makes it last longer. Although its not needed, like you dont HAVE to have it, but it really does pay off.<br>  And if you have good skin then all you need to do is wash your face, and then pat dry it, then you need to slather on moisterizer, and while its still soaking in your skin, put on the liquid foundation, then just put the concealer on the problem areas that is needed, if you dont need to cover anything up, then you can just skip the concealer. i found its nice to get pressed powder and not use the sponge but i use a brush, and i swirl it around and then i dust it on my face so i can lock it all in :)|`|8LNCXw18aa	1. A primer is a layer under the makeup to make it last longer.<br>  <br>  2. Base is a layer under another color to make the color on top pop or mix up.<br>  <br>  3. Blush, Loose Powder, and Browser<br>  <br>  For your foundation if it gives you a weird tint I think you were using the wrong shade for you. Try using a pressed powder type of foundation it's easier application. If the press powder stings then maybe it's too rough for your skin.|`|CAjjymFCaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.I would check out the review site at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and browse the reviews.|`|4VBoqt4jaa	1. primer is a base for your eyes and/or face. <br>  it works similar to primer that you put on your walls before you in the sense that it helps the make up go on more even, more pigmented, and helps it last longer. <br>  2. it can mean different things for different people, when i say apply a base i mean foundation and/or powder. <br>  3. since you have nice skin, i would avoid putting foundation all over. it can clog your pours. just put it where you need it. as far as if you need to apply a primer to your face, that is entirely up to you. i would recomend it for your eyeshadow though.|`|tFIS2HbVaa	1. A primer serves as a base for your foundation or eyeshadow(eye primer). It helps your makeup stay on longer and it also helps makeup go on smoothly.<br>  2. A base for face is usually foundation or primer or both. For eyes, it's usually a light colored eyeshadow or a primer or both.<br>  3. Primers are not necessary. It depends on the person if she wants to use it. Concealer is also optional.
gfUUvnpvaa	go to www.skinid.com<br>  take the personalized skin test and it will ask your specific questions on how your skin is and what you want out of it.<br>  Because you have oily skin in some places yet dry in others, you want to make sure you check off COMBINATION skin. When you're done with the test it will give you three products, a cleanser, spot treatment and face moistuizer that is perfect for your conditions.<br>  Cost a little over 30$ for the three products and it includes a travel size bag of your color and a free acne spot treatment. And then 5 bucks to refill your products.<br>  try it out, or at least take the test and see if you like what you get.|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	The absolute best product ever is tablets called "Roactine". I had terrible acne as well. You have to take the tablets for 6 months though. Side effects are like dry skin, occasional blood nose, but nothing to serious. It completely dries your skin, and eliminates all acne. Works like a charm.|`|VtqGIucPaa	i heard that proactiv is good i just dk how expensive it is you can go to a dermatologist and see what they can do. you can put a price on your skin its the first thing people see
9syEUfnqaa	I like the first one the most, you said your asian and i think it would complement your skin tone well. the polka dotted ones are probably not the ones you want.people would pay more attention to the polka dots than you..(im filipino=))<br>  <br>  1.no, theyre all one pieces so no<br>  2. maybe pull on the ties until they are tight and then pin them together so they wont fall, since thats the last thing you want to happen|`|88JCKhJkaa	i only like the first one<br>  the blue is too shiny in the 2nd<br>  the polka dots are too much in the 3rd<br>  and the white and blue look babyish<br>  <br>  you should look at delia's bathing suits. they have some really cute ones|`|clDDi5nJaa	i like the Aeropostale ones <br>  especially that last one<br>  <br>  No they are not too revealing. they're only one-pieces, im 13 i wear bikinis :P|`|U2U624i5aa	2 tell u the truth..i wouldnt even wear any of those and im 15. they r super ugly lol  and def not..bathing suits arent too revealing but id go for a bikini, not a one piece, they r so better.|`|Zo8cmm8Aaa	the 3rd is<br>  the best look|`|XCX8w4LMaa	i don't really like any of them because they're one pieces. <br>  sorry i just don't like one pieces.|`|kO3RGQWXaa	i am 14 too and i like the 1st and 2nd ones they are really cute!! hope i helped!|`|ocfAJGoBaa	there cute...i like the 3rd one.....and the 1st<br>  <br>  <3|`|EITi9oeDaa	The second solid colored tealish one is the cutest one. It's not too revealing at all for your age because it covers your entire stomach and chest. Make sure to buy the smallest size though because those are women sizes. <br>  The polka dots are cute but kind of going out of stlye now.<br>  To know them you just make a simple bow knot, like your shoelaces(: You'd be surprised how well it stays. Trust me I have a lot of string bikinis (:|`|VGy0iFMAaa	I think the first bathing suit is cute. <br>  <br>  1. I don't think that the swimming suits are too revealing.<br>  2. Just double the knots on the swimming suits.|`|XyOsRQvgaa	i like the first one the best (:<br>  no way is that too revealing, though. when i was 14 i wore a bikini, no big deal. as long as you aren't wearing a thong bikini, that's a bit much.<br>  as for securing it, just tie a bow.. that's what i do and i haven't had any problems.|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	i personally wouldnt suggest wearing one of those type if you are at all overweight, but if you have a nice body still , go ahead i like the 1st one|`|8iQFdkIhaa	1. they are all 1 piece, so no.<br>  2. knots dont come undone if you tie them tight<br>  the 3rd one is the best.|`|3yacqUltaa	I like the 3rd one. <br>  I don't think it's too revealing at all, I mean it's not even a bikini.|`|98ftTISiaa	i like the first one. and i dont like so, im 14 too, i think it will look fine.|`|NpzNHmCGaa	I think the forth one. The reason I say this is because you say your a little overweight and the other ones have cut out sections on the side which if you are a bit chubby in that area I think they would be unflattering (due to slight overspill). However if you have a large chest the forth one may not suit you. I would think they are all ok for a 14 year old.|`|bed4c33bdb3017e1a505b0d8611e0264aa	I like the second one :) I think I'd go for the black one myself...but whatever color you like would work I think.  It shouldn't be too revealing.|`|uAzToWC7aa	the second one is the best! and theyre not too reveling, and the other ones are just ugly and immaure|`|wOcTPbf7aa	i like the first one ;)<br>  1.no<br>  2.don't know.|`|oKEkKhd4aa	I like #2 the best, and yes, it is appropriate for a 14-year old|`|MA8AUiQYaa	i like the fourth one its soo cute (:|`|WW66AkgJaa	i like the second one. it's really cute. but the other three are just too common.|`|MmwaUpthaa	i like the first one the most
4hzPCxmyaa	Don't use peroxide! Nothing with alcohol in it. that will prevent your piercing from healing. It kills the good bacteria as well as the bad. Use a sea salt salt twice a day for six weeks or so, depending on how long it takes to heal.<br>  <br>  A sea salt soak is sea salt mixed with water. Only use a little bit of sea salt, and use warm water. Don't mess with it if you haven't washed your hands. Or really, don't mess with it at all. Wash your hands before cleaning it, just in case.|`|8iQFdkIhaa	use some antibiotic ointment on it,|`|KfKr3hUmaa	keep cleaning it for a week and dont strain you neck. gp to the dr. in a week or 2 if it gets worse. DONT USE PEROXIDE! go to claires and get one of there kits|`|QhhQ3Wrraa	if its crusty, then its infected.

31NapKplaa	yes they will|`|rDsKB0uXaa	were the same size so yes (:|`|98ftTISiaa	i was like that and they never did.|`|8zGtTEoVaa	Yes. They should fit you. When I was wearing that in youth sizes, I was still wearing a double 0 in aeropostale clothes. American Eagle and Areopostale are mostly the same so they should fit you!!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|WW66AkgJaa	Oh yea they for sure will, i'm a size 12 slim too in jeans too and 00 jeans fit me perfectly in american eagle.|`|AA11333546	well to be certain you obviously have to try them on..|`|oNlLKAWFaa	They will probably be too big because i wear a 14 in kids sizes and the American Eagle 00 jeans fit me. I would try Aeropostale. They have good sized jeans for skinnier people! haha.|`|pRuF8qOdaa	probably<br>  <br>  go to the american eagle web site and look at the size chart.<br>  it will give you measurments for your body on what size you should fit into|`|UIF7OBuxaa	I'm sure some styles will fit.<br>  <br>  Never know until you try!|`|xHC8fNdiaa	i dont think they will
Xq0dR6eYaa	i am like the exact same size, && i get my jeans at abercrombiekids. they have slim sizes && ver' small sizes. sooo i would reccommend abercrombiekids && oldnavy aswell. they also sell small sizes. :]<br>  <br>  hope i helped hun :D<br>  <br>  ---xoxoxoxoxoxo|`|YMrisRg5aa	Hi there! I feel your pain, it's rare for me to find a pair of decent jeans.<br>  <br>  What kind of jeans are you looking for? Skinny, boot cut, flares? Pac Sun has a lot of different types, and they have different deals all the time, like buy one get one free or buy 2 pairs for $55.|`|QzJnC2y2aa	I really love levis and H&M pants. But every body is different, Just try on every pair. Hope this helps.|`|31NapKplaa	try charlotte russe they have like a million sizes<br>  <br>  good luck!
AA11074814	Quit letting it bother you. Mature guys treat it as a beauty spot.|`|Xl88AmV4aa	it depends on the guy! If it's on your back, then i don't think you should really worry about it. if you are that worried, get it removed!|`|p3yrTIVyaa	I have about five or more on my back,<br>  and my boyfriend knows about them,<br>  he doesn't seem to be repulsed,<br>  he rubs my back all the time, and doesn't avoid them or anything, it really does depend on the guy though.
hDzjpF62aa	You can go ahead and dye over your regular hair, the only time that you need to have it bleaches is if the color you want is lighter than the color you have.|`|S15ffaE8aa	No.. just go to your stylist and have them do a a tone on tone.. But I may say that you are very lucky.. Because a lot of people want what you have.. b.c black hair usually has a blue tint in it.. Make sure they do a level 2..|`|TPUqEBReaa	All you have to do is apply the color. Simple as that! <br>  <br>  Hope that helps ya!|`|Lc620r7maa	yes   i did it   just dy it|`|S9nthF7vaa	yea, i did that. : D|`|buLYCudWaa	Yes go ahead|`|a315d4b46f075e0544a1da68a65bc218aa	NO! unless you want your hair to fall out.
sOT7lw1saa	Wear skinny jeans, with fringe boots, uggs, Sam Edelmanns, or Minnetonkas! I love all of those boots. Then, wear a plaid, or plain colored Pea Coat, with a cute scarf. Make your hair curly and wear cute dangly earrings! And under the Pea Coat, wear a striped cardigan with a graphic tee! (keep the scarf on!) It would look so cute! Hope that helped!|`|glOPAyeIaa	Wear something comfy, cute, but classic. try a cute solid polo, with a  pair of regular wash jeans, and vans or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  Lindzz
AA10312653	BURGUNDY....it will look awsome on you.....and if you want some blonde then do like a strip in the front or on the side or something....best of luck|`|FhHkT0bBaa	I like your hair dark,the blonde streaks are so last year,and burgundy only looks good on old ladies.Your so pretty,why mess with it at all/|`|FaMt17xZaa	I  think you should leave your hair the same! it looks nice like that...i also just want  to say that the 2nd pick of the blond girl has crazy spacers....omg thats so nuts how there so huge lol|`|8iQFdkIhaa	i think u should leave it! it looks so pretty how it is!|`|88JCKhJkaa	definitly the blonde|`|z8VRBWPDaa	THE SECOND ONE!|`|7tD0HgwIaa	burgundy! u look really pretty! dont go blonde that will look very very bad! pr keep the dark brown! u r gorgeous!|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	you are really really really pretty now-keep it the way it is! and i love your eye makeup!|`|NpJk2Heraa	Yeah, the second one with blonde highlights.

It may look like one but many people also get cysts as pimples and don't even know it. These cysts take a while to go away and can be treated as every other pimple to go away but it will just come right back up later. You can go to the dermatologist and they can prescribe you a topical cream for it or laser it off.<br>  <br>  Just stop touching it and leave it alone, don't keep putting concealer over it, it will iritate it way more! Keep the skin clean as you can so it can heal. Also, popping them is bad. You get scarring and your spreading the bacteria over more surfaces of your face.. possibly giving you another pimple.|`|AA12006899	yes i was gonna say toothpaste too , it realy works like if i went to school with a zit like urs i would jump off a building soo i used toothpaste and it worked|`|xHC8fNdiaa	have you tried popping it

If you use any products, it might turn your eyebrows a different color, make the hair grow back too thick, etc.<br>  Good luck!|`|HYTPPq6Qaa	you just need to have time pass by.<br>  the thing i do is, hide my tweezers so i'm not tempted to pluck any hairs. and i massage my eyebrows for like 30 seconds. good luck!

It really helps|`|gKK6De7laa	It depends flat ironing your hair is fine as long as you have a ceramic plated flat iron (it will say on the box; most are) another good thing is to buy a protecting hair product to put on your hair before you straighten or a leave in conditioner.<br>  <br>  I flat iron my hair daily and what I do to help is use a deep conditioning mask once a week.|`|21kWIi3Caa	sorry but flat ironing your hair does fry your hair up. it'll damage it more. your hair gets exposed to too much heat that it makes it weak and unhealthy. i wouldn't straighten it much. i have the same problem!|`|fpGqmFKvaa	well i am getting a new hair straightener ( where i come in australia we call them hair straighteners) and i am also getting this special spray that protects my hair from any damage.|`|uAzToWC7aa	well, it will get fried if you use it on wet hair, but other than that you can just use hair heat protection sprays or serums like freeemans-sun drenched heat protecton spray, it smells great and works well, and lasts a long time, or garnier fructis products ( :|`|S15ffaE8aa	Are you using a protective spray/cream on your hair when you do?

qSFtNZ1jaa	Theres no method to make your hair grow longer (and I know this because my beauty book described them as myths). You might be getting blood flow to your scalp but its not going to the hair follicles and telling it to grow. Hair grows a half inch per month.<br>  And yes you shouldn't trim it too much otherwise you'll just be cutting off your length. I suggest you just cut it when you see damage and keep using professional shampoo and limit using hot tools. Especially on your ends.. be very careful when using hot tools on your ends, they're fragile and can get easily damaged.<br>  Also you can help the condition of your hair by being on a proper diet.<br>  I'm a living example.. I just stopped cutting my hair, and my a line hair style grew out.. and I didn't want it anymore. So I just grew it into a bob.. then grew it out from there. I didn't bother cutting my hair since August, I think its almost time I need a hair cut..

f8bf26c17d2b021c337d130648b25311aa	I work at a tanning salon, and if you're pretty white I recommend doing 5 low-pressure tans, and going 2 days in a row, then skipping a day then going 2 days in a row.  You should have a base tan, if not do another 5 of low-pressure.  Once you have a base tan do 10-20 sessions of medium-pressure.  High pressure wont do too much but burn you, and if you start out higher you'll just get a bad burn. Good Luck, and if you have any questions let me know|`|8e3g0F5Gaa	definately go with the high pressure beds. im from WI and was pale as well, and used a level 2 but burned a lot then i tried a high pressure bed and OMG i got so tan and i didnt burn. it is well worth the money. try it and if it doesnt work for you then you can do something else but yeah definately do the high pressure. good luck|`|ja7kdPIGaa	I do medium pressure. <br>  You'll want to start out slow though to get your base tan first. <br>  <br>  You can always get like a monthly thing instead of package deals (it's usually cheaper) and you should be ready to go in like a month if you go 3-4 times a week<br>  <br>  Make sure you get some lotion too so you soak up allll the rays you can :)<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|fbV6aofraa	TRY the low pressure.  If you burn and peel it is much smarter to start with low and BUILD.  There are many accelerators and bronzers that won't turn you orange, but will keep you from damaging your skin more than you have to in order to start your base tan.  Any tanning salon should have multiple samples of bronzers w/ accelerators that you can try.  Don't mess around too much with the largest organ of your body!!! <br>  <br>  Good luck! :)|`|s1MbGhpHaa	Tanning beds give you cancer.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	You probably just wanna do the reg tanning beds for a few sessions to get a base tan before spending that much money on the pressure beds. I tan really easily, but if i go to a pressure bed with no base tan, I burn. I dunno how much it is where you live, but here the reg beds are a quarter for 2 mins and the super beds are a quarter per minute. it will def save ya some money and possible pain and peeling.

ltXxNfwRaa	Hun, if people are straight up telling you to your face that you're ugly, you need to tell them where the f to go!  I wouldn't take any crap like that!<br>  <br>  We all have our good and bad days... but the way I look at it, is if people don't like the way you look, then who gives a f u ck!  They are obviously insecure... and I highly doubt that youre ugly!  If people are telling you that then chances are they are jealous of something about you and want to try to bring you down cuz thats the way theyre feeling!  I used to want the same kind of acceptance too, but then I accumulated genuine people that are friends of mine through the good hair days, the no makeup days and the days I make a complete a s s outta myself!  Ditch the pressure people!  You dont need them!!!<br>  <br>  Seriously, the best thing to do is to give off the impression that you dont give a f u c k!  Exude confidence and if someone tries to bring you down then tell the bastard to screw off!  I wasted a lot of time worrying about what others thought... and now that I don't, I have the best life!!!|`|Re8d6PJkaa	Happens to me all the time.

81phZ7Y6aa	I have the instyler<br>  I have relatively normal hair, and from experience, i know that after one<br>  use my hair was extremely dry feeling and damaged looking.  <br>  This is because the plates that you put your hair through are METAL not ceramic.  The metal causes burning to your hair and this isnt healthy for it.  I have only used it once and I have stopped using it because it made my hair so dry the metal plates stripped it of all of its natural moisture<br>  I hope it works for you though!

If you want to take it out and let it heal it will probably heal over within 24 hours, the tongue heals very quickly.  You could eat when you take it out whenever you want, just rinse with mouth wash until its healed over.  <br>  If you wanna take it out and change it or just take it out to eat, I wouldn't suggest doing it.  Goodluck with yours =]|`|p54wgtDqaa	Are you taking it out just to replace it with another bar? If so, don't even bother trying that just now, you need to wait until it heals completely before you can do that. <br>  <br>  But if your taking it out for good, just clean your hands with normal soap. as its only 3 days old it wont take long for it to heal up. <br>  <br>  Either way you can eat whenever, it may be slightly sore & a bit awkward at first with the bar in but you'll get used to that & within a few days you wont even notice it.|`|RUBrEPCpaa	Tounge percing= bad idea!|`|QhhQ3Wrraa	if its 3 days old, dontttt take it out<br>  you can eat as soon as you want<br>  it might hurt though|`|NOz2NIMTaa	DO NOT TAKE IT OUT.

gfUUvnpvaa	The Dove Sunless tanner is prob the best one out there. If you definately want a darker shade (in a bronze way) then you should use it. However make sure to apply in your hand, rub it around in your palms THEN APPLY. Also a good suggestion would be to mix it with a nice body lotion like Vaseline or Nivea because it will even it out more and reduce odd marks or uneven spots. Dont use it before bed because it will appear on your sheets. Take a hot shower in the morning and EXFOLIATE with some sort of body scrub. Right after the shower apply the tanner and then within a few hours you'll be amazingly bronze. It's definately not too orange unless you apply too much too often. Make sure to wash hands after too because it will be obvious between your fingers|`|sNnWreZbaa	I use this too!<br>  <br>  If you get the darkest shade,  it usually starts working pretty quickly!  I'd say an hour or so.  You'll definitely see changes after a day.  (If you're already dark skinned, it won't make much of a difference though)<br>  <br>  Be sure to wash the palms of your hands (and especially in between the fingers; it tends to stain over there and you end up with dark brown patches in those areas...)|`|fbV6aofraa	Generally you can see a difference instantly, but some lotions take hours to really soak in and show their color. ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS test it on an area of your skin that clothes will cover, incase it turns out to be ugly orange.  Also, do not plan on going out and sweating AT ALL until you can shower the excess of your skin really well.  Your clothes with thank you!

eR89n2z5aa	The terms "Mardi Gras" (m?r`dē gr?) and "Mardi Gras season",[1][2][3][4][5][6] in English, refer to events of the Carnival celebrations, ending on the day before Ash Wednesday. From the French term "Mardi Gras" (literally "Fat Tuesday"), the term has come to mean the whole period of activity related to those events, beyond just the single day, often called Mardi Gras Day or Fat Tuesday.[1][2][3][4][5][6] The season can be designated by the year, as in "Mardi Gras 2008".[6]<br>  <br>  The time varies from city to city, as some traditions consider Mardi Gras as the Carnival period between Epiphany or Twelfth Night and Ash Wednesday.[7] Others treat the final three-day period as being Mardi Gras.[8] In Mobile, Alabama, Mardi Gras events begin in November, followed by mystic society balls on Thanksgiving,[7][9] then New Year's Eve, formerly with parades on New Year's Day, followed by parades and balls in January & February, celebrating up to midnight before Ash Wednesday.[7]<br>  <br>  Other cities most famous for their Mardi Gras celebrations include Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Sydney, Australia and New Orleans, Louisiana. Many other places have important Mardi Gras celebrations as well.<br>  <br>  Carnival is an important celebration in most of Europe, except in Ireland and the United Kingdom where the festival is called "shrovetide" ending on Shrove Tuesday, and pancakes are the tradition, and also in many parts of Latin America and the Caribbean.|`|8XL8aC3Qaa	<a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu_ZnGrNJtoEBAzpXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEzamhjNmNzBHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDNgRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0gyNDZfMTE3/SIG=11r5d62vl/EXP=1236560871/**http%3a//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mardi_Gras">http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu_ZnGrNJto...</a>|`|FNTeLbIuaa	Its when christians celebrate one last time before they fast for lent.

i1Qfson5aa	it means they can take some pain for one but i dont think the location means anything i would look more at the tattoo than where it is|`|k3sL7mZtaa	Nothing in particular.<br>  It's just a place to have a tattoo. Just as if it was on your back, arm, neck, etc.|`|4hzPCxmyaa	Nothing, just that they liked the look of foot tattoos and decided that they wanted one. Most of the tattoos probably have a specific meaning for the person who has it, but some of them might just look nice. It depends on the specific person and tattoo.|`|wXh4QpaYaa	It may have something to do with having the option to cover it up.

XyKnvoypaa	Purple or Red. But if you want to go for a more natural color you could try a caramel/blondish color.

Eke5JMhdaa	I started when I was in the 5th grade and had no problems so personally, I think it you're old enough for sure. If you don't feel comfortable though, don't let anyone tell you what to do. You should try using an electric razer at first, they work well, they're super easy to use and there's no risk of cutting your skin.|`|vLQX7I82aa	If you feel that you are a hairy monster then yes!<br>  But do it like once a month because they shouldn't be too noticable.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't like those girls who shave everyday when they don't wear anything that reveals their legs.<br>  <br>  If you do wear skirts and other revealing bottoms besides in PE i'd advise you do so.|`|AA10064810	If they bother you, shave them.

ustlrb8taa	Well, it is always best to respect your parents, but the best way to persuade is to have a logical argument set up.  Talk not about how it would be good for your enjoyment, but of the benefits to your character, your responsibility skills, and the new social environment in the house.  Remember who your audience is, and you'll do fine.  Plan ahead is the key way to get what you want.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Just to let you know, the reason that they're saying it is because dogs require a great deal of attention and if college is in  your future, it means that they are the ones who will have to walk the dog and feed it and all the other stuff that you will be doing before you leave.  Then when you graduate, you will probably have to live someplace that doesn't allow dogs.<br>  <br>  Dogs live from eight to twenty years, depending on the breed.  So, while YOU are the one that wants this dog, THEY are the ones who will end up with it.  I think it's only fair that they make the decision.  Sorry.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd try to find a home for it where I could visit it very often.|`|hCErpu7Eaa	say you will do chores, help pay for the food.. how big is will the dog get? this may be a concern for them.. so maybe you could talk about keeping the dog outside in a dog house... (even if you think that would never happen..lol)
qjCY4Y7zaa	I think that my nose hurt worse! There's really no way to describe the pain, but it's not that bad. As far as a job, you can always take it out or wear a clear retainer if you have to. I am a lead in a warehouse making over $30,000 a year and I have tattoos and piercings!|`|RMppfinbaa	not that painful. Definitely less painful than your nose. I wouldn't do it though because 10 years down the line when you're going for a job interview, you'll have to take it out (or else you'll look unrepresentable and unprofessional) and you'll be left with a whole in your face. It's something to consider. The pain is about a 5/10|`|1ipReV54aa	It made my eyes water.<br>  And the first day it doesn't hurt much at all.<br>  The day to two days after though i didn't enjoy it much.<br>  It was very swollen and sore.<br>  Hard to get used to it.<br>  <br>  And don't listen to that bogus about the hole.<br>  I have a hole but you can't even tell it was there.<br>  I had the piercing for quite a while though<br>  Took it out an account of my job.<br>  It doesn't fly well with a lot of people.<br>  But i think it's a very cute piercing and I would probably get it done again if i chose a career where it was accepted.

I think what would be cool for you to do is to dye the bottom layers of your hair either a lighter/darker shade or different color than what you have now, so there is that contrast you want, but not so obvious and then maybe a few highlights of the other color in your brown hair. Trust me, it looks really rad.|`|TPUqEBReaa	I would add highlights to your bangs first..and see what you think.

xGOJutMmaa	I would try nair. I use it all the time. You can go two weeks without having to shave again and the hair grows back thinner and lighter. <br>  Hope this helps!|`|aZukucejaa	I would go with shaving. Plucking would take forever and HURT, especially if you accidently pulled your skin. Waxing would be nice, and isn't too hard to do at home, BUT the biggest con to that is you have to let your hair grow to 1/4 inch before you can wax it off. But its not THAT painful and you can get wax at Sallys for under 10bucks. I would just keep shaving and shave more often...I mean, armpits are all different and arent the most beautiful thing in the world.|`|KfKr3hUmaa	where? thats my question, on the legs, shave EVERDAY armpits shave, eyebrows wax/pluck|`|fbV6aofraa	You've got your answers!  You just need to decide for yourself.  Waxing shows the best results with less risk of razor burn, but you gotta decide for yourself if the pain is worth it.  If you are doing it at home you can always soak in the bathtube for a while before applying.  This will help the pain some, but not too much.|`|vi6wRVAQaa	well almost everybody shaves but i would wax if i had money but also it hurts the first time and them it wont hurt anymore if you keep on doing it. so i say shave or wax|`|udZeXZkkaa	There's Nair, and that stuff is pretty cool unless your skin is really sensitive like mine was.<br>  <br>  But I still use it. ;)<br>  <br>  Waxing would be the second thing.

53Yp0Zsmaa	first u would have to learn how to keep your eyes very still.<br>  like lets say ur applyign eyeliner to the top lids.<br>  you would have to learn how to close one eye completly without squinting and let the eye lid stay smooth in stead of wrinkly while being able to see the mirror with the other eyes.<br>  use pencil first then liquid once u get practiced.<br>  sometimes using your hand to stretch out the eye helps.<br>  if your putting on botttom eyeliner then use your finger to press again your skin under the eys and stretch it so you see the whitish soft skin right where your lashes come out form.<br>  this is the liner you apply your pencil eyeliner on.<br>  any tips needed.<br>  try youtube.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	Use a pencil eyeliner,<br>  if you have a double-eyelid it'll be easy.<br>  Just glide it around your eye slowly, and then fix the imperfections with the eyeliner and a q-tip.<br>  Just keep practicing.|`|tFIS2HbVaa	start with a pencil eyeliner and when you get the hang of it, try using gel or liquid. liquid is the hardest to apply but it gets easier after a while.
gfUUvnpvaa	Go tanning or start tanning outside in the sun more. Look for bronze or brown/golden shades of eyeshadows. Mascara you can either go with something like Covergirl Exact Eyelights and try to match one with your eye color or Lashblast depending on what your looking for.

uoNJhBxfaa	The "dead cells" are strands of protein. If the hair is not taken care of the protein bonds will break down which usually results in split ends, breakage, and thinning hair. Shampoos with vitamins help to keep the protein bonds strong and prevent them from breaking down. The vitamins are also good for the scalp.

24tOkze1aa	Be the BIGGEST PIMP you can be!!!! Its only 1 time you do this so make it count! While your at it, you should roll up in A Bentley and 4 biotches! Dont forget to put on the Rolex.|`|sLGehA4raa	If you're going to do white tie, do it right or not at all. That means a well-tailored coat, stiff-fronted shirt with detachable wing collar, low-cut pique vest and self-tied bow tie, mother-of-pearl cufflinks and studs, patent leather plain-toe oxfords, black silk calf-length hose, and optional silk top hat. Also, a tailcoat is not a tuxedo. <br>  <br>  If you were thinking about just renting whatever, forget it. Overdressing is a high-level game. I agree that the standard shirt and pants is boring. Try a good suit. Not a black four-button suit with a red shirt and a skinny tie, a real suit.|`|J3Kz3OSOaa	It doesnt matter what other people think.<br>  <br>  If you think that you can rock that tux, then rock it!|`|WW66AkgJaa	i think what you're going to wear sounds really cute, it's classy. i'd love it if my date dressed good and not just a button up.

fbV6aofraa	Your friend needs to not give advice....you need to BUILD!  Some people have no trouble skipping a gauge, BUT the bigger the jewelry you are trying to stretch in, the greater the chance there is of something going wrong (i.e. staph infection, rejection, tearing, and major scarring).<br>  <br>  Get you piercing looked at by a licensed piercer.  They will be able to tell you if you should be concerned about your piercing, AND they can give you further advice.  This usually only costs a couple buck for a consulation.
TOh1rmXTaa	If you have long lashes , you don't have to wear mascara. But you could wear purple eyeliner. Trust me , it looks better than it sounds. If you wear pink eye shadow with it, it will look pretty ! :-)|`|V2F8YCa2aa	Well, I have hazel eyes too, and I wear a gold eyes shadow, and some dark brown mascara, but if you already have long lashes, then you don't need it.|`|4OGtxtPHaa	Purple's a good color to bring out brown and hazel. You should wear black eyeliner on the bottom and purple on your top lids and a purple mascara. That'll really bring your eyes out.|`|Ea3HofRxaa	you should usea medium brown color to bring out the brown in your hazel eyes

0Iin6kO4aa	most tattoo shops will do that for you.|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	I thought good artists incorporated the scar into the tattoo design but did not tattoo over the scar tissue itself. The scar tissue is always changing and tattooing might actually prevent the scar from healing and becoming less noticeable on its own.<br>  Try breaking open vitamin E capsules and treating the scar with the gel to reduce its appearance.|`|9TE9lOKBaa	You can get a tattoo over a scar easily.<br>  It depends on how old the scar is. If it's newer than 6 months, you can't tattoo over it|`|9HQVrydZaa	i have many tattoos over scars and yes it is possible mate.my boyfriend does all of mine and i do his as we are both tattooists. ask around mate as you should find 1 place that will do a tattoo over scars.|`|VN18al90aa	If i was you i'd get it over the scar, the trick is not to get it around the scar otherwise the keen scar watcher will still be able to tell it's there|`|jh3Fni5Baa	the guys name is Alex and hes awsome!!!!! its near oakwood and davenport|`|9slEBzokaa	most good and well experienced tattoo artists are able to do a very good jobs in covering the scares. Although the price might be a little more than juss a regular tattoo.<br>  Just find a safe, clean, well experienced tattoo store and ask them if they do any coverups.

tFIS2HbVaa	No, you don't. You just have to be able to pay them. You can use your mom or dad's credit card or something if they allow you to. Or your debit card if you have one. Sometimes you can just send them a check.|`|Draugm5qaa	nope, but you might need a credit card to subscribe.<br>  so that could be a problem of you don't have a parent<br>  who will let you use theirs.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|71wBNgbnaa	No, you don't have to be 18 or older. You don't even need a credit card. When you send in the card to subscribe, just check "Bill Me Later." However, make sure you pay the bill promptly or they will cut off the subscription and it will be turned over to a collection agency, no matter what your age is. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped. :)|`|z7IYhVXzaa	No. I started subscribing to magazines when I was 14. It's more about paying for the subscription than anything really. :)|`|WW66AkgJaa	no, you just need to pay the bill that comes along with it. that's really all they care about.|`|xHC8fNdiaa	no i dont think so

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Mine, on the contrary, was probably about an 8! <br>  (if we're talking about pain on the tattoo scale that is - if it's compared to other stuff in life then it's a 1/10 after having been through childbirth!)<br>  <br>  It was my first tattoo though so I was very tense, and it was a long and detailed job... but yeah, it rates as one of my more painful. Which should show you that pain really is relative to everybody. If it could be a 1/10 for one person and an 8/10 for another then there is no point in asking because you could be pegged anywhere between those points. Just eat a big meal before you go, try and relax and breathe through the painful bits. Take an ipod too. And don't even think about painkillers or alcohol. I'm sure mine was only so bad because of the psychological build up I gave it.

It helps stimulate the blood circulation and pumps hair production on your scalp.<br>  <br>  To prevent split ends get a trim every 3 months get about 1/4 of an inch off.

You can get it at Sally Beauty supply.<br>  <br>  Eat plenty of protein and veggies. Because that is what hair is made of.<br>  <br>  Do a weekly treatment of extra virgin olive oil.

And this is true as these are myths. You can't trim your hair to make your hair grow faster, or rub your scalp or anything. Hair grows a half inch per month.<br>  You can add healthy foods to your diet and take vitamins. That might aid you in healthy hair, but not to 'make' it grow. Keep using professional shampoos, brush your hair from the bottom up, and only trim your hair when you see split ends (it depends on how often you mess with your hair or use hot tools but if you see they're dry and damaged its time for a trim).<br>  Hope this helps.|`|3QPoFdfLaa	Visit longhaircommunity.com for everything you need to know about hair !|`|KlV0qKSHaa	yes fish oil pills<br>  or get some vitamin e pills at whole foods if you have one in your area<br>  <br>  if not go to gnc and get hair skin a nails pills<br>  <br>  <br>  they all work great<br>  <br>  lol ive tried everything :)|`|CMWzDKN7aa	concentrate and think really hard

Totally fine (I prefer it that way... if we all had them it wouldn't be so special somehow!). But when people insist on impinging upon the time and patience of others to inflict their narrow minded beliefs upon them? It's pathetic, moronic, stupid, and boring.<br>  <br>  I also think they're just a tad superficial... I'm not bothered about my skin when I'm old. I'm not even bothered about my skin now, if I'm honest. It's just f*cking skin. If one day I decide I don't like it it'll be added to my already long list of things I don't like about my body that I already live with. My life is far deeper and more enriched to really give two hoots about pathetic stuff like that. If I ever regret my tattoos, I couldn't care less. I'll never have the names of partners on me that could affect future relationships... so there'll never be that pressure of regret. Just aesthetics and while I've got it I'm going to make the most of it and when I don't, I'll be wrinkly either way, just more colourful this way. <br>  <br>  And the fact that some other people are SO hung up on appearance, not only of themselves but of the whole world, to the point where they need to constantly remind people of this pathetic fact about ourselves which in reality none of us personally care about, is pitiful, it really is.

8484b98b7322a891688e78db30e42f20aa	My sister's 15 and started using eye liner a year or so ago (I also started using around that age). Anyway, she used to use Covergirl but it didn't work for her since it easily smudged and couldn't last through the day; it also looked shabby. But I think she uses what I use now, which is the Artistry brand (both eyeliner and mascara).<br>  <br>  For me, it definitely beats all of them, and I've used several brands over the years. It really pops your eyes, but in a very subtle, nice way. My sister and I both have dark skin and brown eyes. Oh, and it doesn't smudge either, which is always a plus in my book. I buy it from the website (pasted below) since I believe its cheaper than buying from stores.<br>  <br>  But yeah, definitely give it a try, especially since it's your first time and all, so it would give you excellent control.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps mate and good luck in high school! ^_^|`|xfAk2KaUaa	Eyeliner:<br>  Maybelline Define-A-Line<br>  Revlon Colourstay<br>  Urban Decay 24/7<br>  <br>  (I reccomend you stick withjust pencil liner)<br>  <br>  Mascara:<br>  Maybelline XXL Extensions<br>  Maybelline Lash Stiletto<br>  <br>  I trust mainly Maybelline when it comes to mascaras though I hear many good things about Covergirl Lash Blast|`|COht5Jazaa	since it ur first time going to wear eyeliner i think you should stick to the pencil eyeliner and you the covergrl masacara there all good but if you want alot use the utlra blast and if u want simple use the purple one|`|wssncBGRaa	eyeliner- i havent really found a trusty one yet :/<br>  <br>  mascara- omg cover girl lash blast (orange casee) its frikin amazingg ! it makes the lashes longer and gives them so much volume!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i hope i helpedd !
fTu9yPWAaa	That`s your decision, not ours. But I honestly think you should try it. bring a trusted adult, or your  friend and her mom. Make sure you read everything correctly and before you sign, imagine what your signing for. I really hope some of this helps! Go do it tiger! Roooaarrr!!! P.S never pay the agency till you have proof. There are many scams!|`|OHfZFR31aa	No legitimate agency stops you on the street, takes your personal details and tells you they will do some free test shots. That's not how scouts work. If she were legit, she would have given you her card and asked you to call the agency to make an appointment. They NEVER take your details, and certainly don't promise a test shoot - that doesn't happen until your second or third callback. Plus, I don't know any scouts who are 25 - most of them are in their late 30s-50s and have worked in the industry a LONG time<br>  <br>  Most of these are nothing but scams - the "test shoot" is free but you have to pay for the pictures. Or they try to make you pay for registration, website listings, competitions, classes, comp cards, etc.<br>  <br>  Remember, a legitimate agency will never charge you ANYTHING. Test shoots are always free, and you never have to pay for prints with a legitimate agency<br>  <br>  Find out the agency's name and google their name + scam to see what comes up. <br>  <br>  If you send in pictures to a legitimate agency, they will have you come in once and maybe take a Polaroid of you. Then if you get a second callback, you'll be seen by the board. And if you get a 3rd callback, that's when they do a test shoot. They don't bother arranging a test shoot unless they are pretty certain they want to sign you.|`|5dDNqwlzaa	Well...<br>  <br>  First of all I would find local agencies only.  You don't know much about modeling and you can't just jump into it.  It's easier and more money efficient to start out small and begin to branch out.  People are going to tell you to go get pictures done, send them to places in NY, etc.  You won't get anywhere.<br>  <br>  If you need pictures to build a portfolio start doing some TF* ("TIME FOR"--* means prints, pictures, CD, etc.-- TFP, TFCD), that means it will be free and it will benefit you and the photographers portfolios.  Look into local photographers or Art class students!<br>  <br>  Send them to local agencies and start there---<br>  <br>  *Remember*<br>  <br>  You never pay an agency.  There are many scams.  So make sure you are prepared.<br>  <br>  You're the right height (hopefully you continue to grow) and age!  Modeling is fun and a great experience.  I wouldn't plan on making a CAREER out of it, but it's a nice way to make occasional money and have some fun.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Qbp0dOGEaa	If you do take your mom or dad and read everything you sign!!|`|iLAABPGDaa	If you do go bring an adult (so you dont get assaulted)<br>  and be safe!|`|FNTeLbIuaa	I think you should go for it!|`|ovYEcLMKaa	I don't know how old you have to be but what about Americas Next Top Model??? that would be one hell of an experience!!
gwSt1fMeaa	I used to have that problem as well. I didnt have shaving cream one week when I went on vacation so I just used a bar of Olay moisturizing soap my friend gave me and I noticed I didnt have any bumps... So I switched from shaving cream over to Olay moisturizing bar soap (the kind in the purple package).  I haven't had any problems since and it makes your skin really soft.|`|AA10064810	You need to do something to your skin before you shave.  It is reacting because it is irritated.  Check to see if your razor is sharp enough.  Leave the shave cream on longer to soften the hair.  Try changing the brand in case you are sensitive to it.  Reread the directions and be sure you are following them exactly.  Make sure that the moisturizer you are using afterwards isn't making your skin break out.  Good luck.|`|EDD98gLFaa	try a different razor? or make sure you change it often so it doesnt get dull

4MYJpkZcaa	Dude, there are haters everywhere! That's what happens when you put yourself out there on the internet where millions of people can access it.<br>  Some are jealous, some enjoy it, some simply don't like you or what you are saying, some think you are stupid. It's a result of clashing opinions, although I do agree that at times they can be irrational and rude. Some people are simply rude...what else can I say?|`|0AQF8pnKaa	well if you weren't so damn conceited no would hate hate you so much mr. i think im so hot|`|fpGqmFKvaa	because that is how some people react when they are angry at someone, they have to let it out somehow. When i get angry or upset i sleep on it and in the morning i am all better. <br>  <br>  :)|`|4hr9JGAdaa	Maybe its because you like to post questions saying your so hot, and acting all conceited.

YHZ2vztiaa	By the time I was 16, I had 8 body piercings which included 4 facial.<br>  The way I pretty much got my parents to leave me alone about my liking for body modification was that I was legal and that I could sign for my piercings myself and that I would go get them regardless of what they said. Again, it is a way of self expression which is a very valid point that you may want to bring up in talking to them about getting pierced. I agree with a previous answer, it's not as if this is a tattoo thats going to be under your skin forever, its simply a little hole with a small bit of metal through it that can easily be removed and closed up which will leave a tiny hole.<br>  Just use valid points about it and hopefully it works out for the best :)|`|JhL4BxpXaa	Alright. If your parents are anything like many others out there, they want their kids to stay out of trouble. I would sit them down (when they are not in the middle of anything, and are in a good mood), and ask for them to promise not to say anything until you have presented your case. (also try and outline what you will say before you say it). Follow the following points:<br>  -this is a way to express yourself<br>  -by doing just one peircing, it's better than you rebelling and getting mad and getting into other bad things.<br>  - promise them the peircing won't be below the neck.<br>  -You would be willing to pay half for it (if not all of it... if you really want this, your gonna have to compromise)<br>  -This can be part of a present, birthday, or christmas, etc.<br>  <br>  After this, ask them WHY they won't let you get one, and see their side of the whole situation... but remember.. keep your cool. :)|`|FYISPUt4aa	Just wait until you are 18!! your body is still growing. what if it looks good when you get it pierced, but 5 years from now it's not in the same spot cause you grew? then what? you'll have a scar if you take it out and let it heal up. <br>  <br>  your parents are afraid you'll end up looking like this: <br>  <a href="http://news.bmezine.com/2008/03/11/elaine-davidson-still-getting-pierced/" rel="nofollow">http://news.bmezine.com/2008/03/11/elain...</a>|`|dEO34fvYaa	My parents were the same when I wanted a tattoo when I was 16.

Some charge by the tattoo/size, others charge by the hour.<br>  <br>  There is one place where I live that would have charged almost $300 for the tattoo I have on my shoulder blade.

aSso3n7oaa	No. I am highly against pro-ana websites. (pro-anorexia or "for" anorerxia) They only encourge and support people's eating disorders, instead of encourging the recovery of ED.<br>  <br>  Eating disorders ARE unhealthy, but I know you most likely don't care about you own health at this point. Something you might care about: Anorexic people look very ugly and bad. Not hot at all. They look like skeltons. So if you're going for the mal-nurished look then you're on the right path. But if you're trying to look pretty, you're heading in the wrong direction.<br>  <br>  Check out some anti-proana websites.

It is pretty simple to use a curling iron and if you are trying to get that "big" curl, put your hair in the curling iron, and wrap it vertically. It will work great, and fairly easy too!

Be advised that the piercing will likely get caught on your braces often, which in turn may cause your lip piercing to not heal properly.  (Constant irritation to the piercing may cause it to get infected and make it difficult to heal.)  I work for an orthodontist and we've had a few patients have oral piercings and it never caused a problem.  You may consider removing the piercing just for your appointments though, just as a courtesy to the orthodontic staff.  They may worry they will cause you more discomfort if they have to work around the piercing.  :)  Keep your piercing clean and your braces even cleaner!|`|0grPFpzLaa	yuck lip piercings are sick.<br>  <br>  and duh your going to get your mouth screwed up. <br>  <br>  THINK ABOUT IT.<br>  <br>  answer minee<3<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307171958AAM1yhd&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|uAzToWC7aa	no, don't do it because youll have so much truble because theyll get intertwined and stuck with each other and itll hurt really badly.!

Some orthodontists do not allow you to have any lip related piercings during your time with braces.<br>  <br>  The ring and brackets can easily become intertwined which can result in a lot of different complications including emergency rooms, ripping your lip, pulling off a bracket, losing a tooth, infection, etc. <br>  <br>  Even if you continue and no HUGE problems occur with the braces and ring, they will constantly become intertwined and cause a lot of pain, especially in the early stages of braces and when your brackets get adjusted. <br>  <br>  Most piercers will not allow you to get another lip piercing during the brace process because of health concerns and so on.<br>  <br>  If you are really that determined and do not care about any of this, go ahead, but you are taking a big risk.|`|OZNqqwyNaa	you can but you probably shouldnt.<br>  it doesnt look good with lip rings and braces anyways.<br>  too much metal.
t4gjClN0aa	Well this is like me trying to convince my dad to let me get my tongue pierced, and it reminds me of when i did debating last year, you need to understand his reasons and come up with a response- as in<br>  <br>  he thinks you will end up with a whole face of piercings; <br>  <br>  explain to him that  you dont have an intention of getting more after this one, or make a promise that this will be the only one, or if you decide to get another one, say that you will swap it (just say you had your nose done then wanted to get your eyebrow done, say you would swap the nose for an eyebrow one) if you are willing to do that- Personally i thnk one facial piercing is enough at a time anyway :)<br>  <br>  and it only looks trashy if you make it look that way- many things contribute to a piercing looking trashy on a person and assure him you understand that.<br>  hope that was helpful ! feel free to message me if you want some more info (:|`|Z3W8t5QJaa	Ask him exactly how you having piercings is going to affect his life?

I have tried numerous others, but none work as the Clinique does.  It hydrates the dry areas of the face, and dries the oily parts of the face.  Most of us have the "T" zone, which is generally oilier than the rest of the face.  This makeup is PERFECT for that.  Any Clinique rep at the store will help you to select the perfect color.  It's a great makeup that I am sure you will be happy with.  Good luck......try it.  You'll never use anything else again!|`|U2U624i5aa	no, i do not wear liquid foundation because it seems caked on even when i barely use any. i use this :<a href="http://images.revlon.com/HTML/Images//Products/ProdDetail/P-faceAdSkinSmthngPwdr-lg.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.revlon.com/HTML/Images//Pr...</a><br>  it works really good :D|`|gUHBJiCfaa	Theres really a lot you could do.

If not, I'd recommend a powder and a foundation. Physician's formula is great and you can buy it at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  As for liquid, I adore Trublend. Are you sure you have the right color? My sister got a color close to hers but it was a warm tint, and looked all wrong. I'd just try another tint, and if you're in doubt as of which one to get, get one that looks slightly lighter because it will blend better. If its way too light for you it will look all wrong too. <br>  <br>  Another reason I suggest you buy a powder is because it evens out liquid foundation. If you put liquid foundation on, and it doesn't look perfect, powder will do the trick. Also, liquid helps the powder stick better and go on more even. They're a perfect team. It's also good because you can get a powder bronzer. Never depend on liquid foundation to make yourself look any darker. It doesn't look natural. A powdered bronzer looks really natural and sunkissed. <br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|Ki6jlwnbaa	I use something called stila from sephora. It's a little pricey but it is soo worth it. I know it says tinter moisturizer but it actually covers imperfections really well. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stilacosmetics.com/product_detail.asp?PMID=176&category_id=7&pos=1&viewall=" rel="nofollow">http://www.stilacosmetics.com/product_de...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I use that and a light brushing of any powder to cut down on the shine. Since its a moisturizer it looks really smooth and nice. I love it. I've used the same one for a long time now.
gOYe2H6Eaa	if u hav bags then do this.. <br>  put a large potato in the frige for lyk a hour or until its chilled. cut it into to slices (not super thin but not real thick). lay those on your eyes for about 20 minutes. then wash your face with a cleanser and lay a cool washcloth over your eyes..<br>  dont know what it does but i read it in a issue of glamour magazine.. my grandma even said it has worked for her. it worked for me for a little while but then it wore off so i recommend doing it once a week...<br>  <br>  hope it helps

They stab it through your tongue, but honestly, the 30 seconds of swishing the real yellow listerine in your mouth beforehand was honestly harder.  <br>  The pain goes away, but your tongue swells so bad after you have it done, so be ready.  <br>  Good luck!|`|HOdblqIkaa	on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the least amount of pain, it was around a 5 or 6. i think the clamp hurt more then the needle but then when he pushed the bar thru it was like a tight uncomfortable feeling. the pain only lasted for a few min but then the pain with the swelling when trying to eat or drink the next few days was around a 3 sometimes 4. the pain only lasted for a few days then it was fine. dont be nervous just go in sit down stick out your tongue take a deep breath and in 2 minutes itll be over. make sure to take care of it right and listen to your artist cause i dont know what the pain with infection is and im sure i wouldnt want to.|`|24sK6L2uaa	mine was about a 2 wasn't bad at all.

4AQ3KsIcaa	Monday: Since Mondays are sooo tiring and no one likes Mondays, try lining your eyes in white eyeliner to open and brighten your eyes. <br>  <br>  Tuesday: Have your hair in loose waves to frame your face.

I love bronze eyeshadow.<br>  <br>  Sunday: Okay, since you're riding a horse, you don't wanna mess up your makeup so just some mascara, chapstick and yeah that's it.<br>  <br>  Okay, I hope this is okay...! :)|`|5cWwSn02aa	MONDAY:do a glamourous look! start off the wek looking fresh, and ready. to make yourself look less tured, first take a white eyelining pencil and line the inside of your bottom lid. this opens ur eyes. then, use a base color slightly lighter than ur skin.., VERY SLIGHTLY.. haha and sweep it from the lash line up to the brow. then, take a light colored, slightly shimmery eyeshadow and, using a brush, sweep it over your lid, up to the crease. then use a lighter colored shadow and use it to hilight the brow bone by putting it right below the brow. then use a light pink blush to brighten your face. take a tiny ammount of brightener and apply it to the cupids bow right above ur top lip, and only right above it..do not go all the way to the nose!! not even close! use a light pink lip gloss, mascara, curl ur eyelashes, and your set!<br>  TUESDAY: brush ur teeth extra good, and bring gum or mints.. but spit it out before u c him! this always adds to a look! =] take a small ammount of black eyeliner and line the top lid, staying very close to the lashes. extend the line to go past your eyes about a half a centimeter. this opens ur eyes, and keeps u looking refreshed even after a day of school! use a black mascara to put mascara, only on the top! and curl them. use a purple eyeshadow.. lightly.. up to the crease! reddish lipgloss, small ammount of pinkish blushand thats it!<br>  WEDNESDAY:use a small ammount of brown eyeliner in the lash line of the top and bottom lashes. add some mascara, curl ur eyelashes, and thats it for the eyes! maybe add a little brown eyeshadow, but make yourself look natural, and not overdone. clear lipgloss, and a tiny bit of pink blush!<br>  THURSDAY: Reddish-pink lipgloss.. like rose colored.. and light pink cheeks. alot of mascara, but not clumpy! curl ur eyelashes exrta good! draw attention to ur lips today! tuesday u drew the attention to ur eyes, now the lips! =]<br>  FRIDAY: light mascara, with black-brown eyeshadow. light pink cheecks and lips. =]<br>  SATURDAY: black eyeliner, top and bottom. take an eyeliner brish and line the bottom lashes with shimmery brownish or purple or if u have blue eyes, with a green. black mascara, curl eyelashes! rose colored lip gloss <br>  SUNDAY: brown mascara, curled eyelashes. very natural today! matte pink lipstick.. light colored. dont overdo it weith the color or u will look off balance! thats it! =] add blush if desired|`|N3qnOlehaa	Monday: Do you wear foundation? if you do, use a mac 188 or 187 brush, it looks flawless. and trust me, its worth the money. So yah, do your foundation (if you wear it) and apply concealer. I usually just use my fingers for that. Apply a powder to set it, then some blush. For your eyes, put on a base (always!) like too faced eyeshadow insurance. Then swipe on some pink eyeshadow or brown maybe for school. add eyeliner and mascara. <br>  <br>  Tuesday: For tuesday, you should do the same thing, but amp it up a little. But don't go too crazy, you don't want to look like your trying too hard. So probably put on a little more eyeliner and mascara and you could probably go for more vibrant colors on the eye. <br>  <br>  Wednesday: same as monday, but you could switch up the colors on your eye. You could use your free time before school to make it perfect, but hey why not spend it with your friends?<br>  <br>  Thursday: same as tuesday!!<br>  <br>  Friday: Since your going to a restaurant, you could do like a smokey eye with browns or blacks. It depends on how fancy it is and what not. You don't want to show up at a Red Robin decked out in fancy clothes and makeup lol. If your sleeping over at your friends, make sure to bring makeup remover!<br>  <br>  Saturday: you'll probably just want to do monday's look again. <br>  <br>  Sunday: Maybe just some powder or something. I doubt your horses care what you look like lol. <br>  <br>  I really super duper hope this helps!!

sLC47VOZaa	Dark Pink/light brown blush, but following your cheek bones, not on your cheek apples because it will make your face look chubbier. If you do it right on your cheek bones, they should look more slender. Dark Brown or dark colorful (dark purple, dark blue) eye shadow extended just past your eye lids so that they look bigger. Black eyeliner but just on the top. If you put it on the bottom your eyes may look like slits. Liquid foundation to cover the scars, the liquid will help get in cracks, and over bumps. Use a mascara such as lash extension or revelon lash fantasy or one of the mascaras that add tubes to your eye lashes look longer. I use the revelon one and everybody says I have really nice eye lashes. I think that'll be a good look for you, but if the blush doesn't work out, ditch it, it might not work with the look.

If your hair is shorter in the front and about shoulder length in the back, it sounds to me that you have length issues that need to be worked out. If you are wanting to wear a ponytail, you probably won't want to take much off the length at all, not to mention, that the length in the front will probably not go in a ponytail to begin with. I would definitely take some of the length off the back to make the sides blend better with the rest of the haircut. After that, I would suggest that you get the rest of it trimmed and let it grow out, so you can get that ponytail that you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps ya! Message me if you have any other questions|`|ror0TbsZaa	you could ask the person cutting your hair to cut the front in angles which looks like layers from the front. also adding extensions to help it grow faster can be good. or if the worst possible thing happens you could just tell him to even it out all around with no style and then change your hair around yourself with tools and clips.<br>  <br>  good luck with your haircut.|`|JQ0YxwQMaa	depending on your face structure, you could go for a variety of different cuts. something to think about would be to grow out your bangs and eventually grow out your hair. if you like it short, maybe a pixie cut? if you like bobs, ask for a long messy one (they are very in right now) or you could try side bangs to change things up...hope this helped.|`|kMccnmlHaa	I would recommend you get bangs and layers. <br>  Good Luck!
gfUUvnpvaa	I work at a tanning place, and MANY 14 year olds come there. It is very common I would say.<br>  Make sure you get an accelerator lotion so your skin stays moisturized and it will speed up the tanning process.|`|quNMu0uoaa	YES. im 14 and i say it is a terrible idea, you'll regret it later. well you can go but, your risk yourself for melonoma. tanning beds is the worst possible thing you can do to your skin when you are old your skin will be permantly damaged. the best way to get a healthy tan is by spray tanning you cause no damage to your skin i recommend that.|`|aoHqKPZTaa	Wait as long as you can before you start tanning.  Wrinkles get real bad!!|`|EBKPbkj7aa	no, but i wouldn't recommend it.<br>  have fun with skin cancer at 16.|`|Gmz0pGQEaa	I think in my opinion that yes it's too young because since your young your skin is young and once a friend of mine did that she had smooth skin but after her tan her skin was terrible but that's her but I still think it's too young and not to be rude but isn't tanning salons a bit thing for OLDER people not teens?!|`|50Ia20yXaa	i personally would not recommend it because the earlier u start, the earlier your skin can be affected through cancer. i actually have really white skin (LIKE REALLY!!!) but ive come to kind of like it so therefore i try to keep it white|`|HOdblqIkaa	in my opinion no, i was tanning that young but you will probably need parental consent as most places wont let you tan if you are under 16, sometimes 17. youll have to check with the tanning beds in your area to see what age they allow.|`|kXjwAYh4aa	hellz yes its to young only girls who feel insucer go tanning and wear make-up. and just too let u know if ur doing those things ur going to look wrinkly when ur holder. DON'T BE FAKE!
ykP7I3caaa	Shave downwards, away from your stomach. This will get most of the hair as long as you rinse the razor often. You can shave downwards pretty much as many strokes as you want without getting razor bumps. But try to keep the strokes down to a minimum. This should get the bulk of the hair.<br>  <br>  For the rest, shave across your bikini area. Like this ----> and this <---- <br>  If that doesn't get all of it pull the skin on your bikini area tight up towards you [because this will pull the now short hairs upwards rather then laying on its side] so you can get it and shave upwards.. But try not to do that too much, that's how you'll get razor burn. The follicles around pubic hair sit up higher kind of like goosebumps and if you shave like that it will basically shave the top layer of skin off causing razor bumps, soreness and bleeding.|`|DMhAPurkaa	You CAN do this and look so lovely and it is so clean and pretty.<br>  This is a las vegas showgirl trick, you can always tell the new ones because they don t know yet-<br>  Stick deodorant is your friend.<br>  A man s razor is second trick.<br>  Woman s razors arent rugged enough to tackle that hair with out having to press too hard.A man s razor will take it off smoother with a light touch, and that will save you from going over and over it.Pressing too hard, (not sharp enough blade), ( or old blade), or shaving dry,( no shaving cream ) will leave you with bumps.<br>  In my opinion, you can use soap, conditioner, or shaving cream there, but you might have to do one side, wash, then the other side. It might burn (the soap, or conditioner, or shaving cream) I personally don t like shaving cream because I need to see all the parts and know what I am doing. I have shaved against the hair with no problem, but I know girls who never do that.I think it gets closer if i go against the grain.<br>  After your shower, or bath, and you might do it in the bath , just so you have the time and can see it better....<br>  After, dab it with a towel, and apply stick deodorant.<br>  Yep. After a week, you won t have any problems with red rashes or bumps, etc..put it on right after you towel dry.After you do your hair,on your head! if it is dry, like you might feel it itching, use an aloe stick for babies on it, or baby oil, or coco nut oil, or I like Tropical Tan , it smells like summer.Be careful of putting anything scented down there.I use the scented deodorant but just be careful, not to get stuff inside, you know.<br>  Stick deodorant has aluminum chlorohydrate, closes off pores,stearyl alcohol, closes pores, talc, and castor oil , which are soothing.<br>  Ingredients vary, but roll ons don t work the same, nor spray.Coat all shaved areas with stick deodorant&<br>  use man s razor, and change razor often, so you don thave bacterial build up.If you can keep your razors in an antibacterial solution, like peroxide /water in a cup, that helps too. Like keep it out of reach so no one drinks it or accidently spills it on the rug ( bleaching action) I keep a cup in the medicine cabinet. Change out the water often.<br>  Keep on bein beautiful you !|`|fXjlWQO6aa	just shave slowly with shaving cream in the direction of hair growth. it leaves a little bit behind but you don't get cut. then put more shaving cream on it and shave the direction opposite of hair growth carefully to get the rest<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApJHXJA9Mp9n2R7GYFafdonsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307164531AA9ngO4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OWwAwcFWaa	i don't use shaving sticks anymore<br>  i use veet<br>  just rub it, wait for 2-3 mins and wipe/wash off<br>  this makes life a lot easier for me<br>  <br>  this is what the product looks like<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.indiaprwire.com/downloads/2008062310515-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.indiaprwire.com/downloads/200...</a>|`|BQV3FQiSaa	I know the feeling. ): <br>  <br>  I've heard that talcum powder works 'wonders,' but haven't yet tried it.|`|2e36923da51c815eb4096942999c182baa	Be advised <br>  <br>  That Shaving is an UN-NATURAL ACT!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Smile<br>  Mother Earth Loves U!<br>  .|`|gTTOoEDLaa	Well you might be shaving the wrong way.

DjakP1bcaa	Microbraids, curly dos, "braid outs", cornrows, and my all time fav. kinky twists. You are young so you can experiment with colors and using perming rods to curl the ends. It's fairly easy to do at home, and it easy to maintain and is also a protective style. <br>  <br>  Purchase IC Fantasia gel, Marley hair (of any color), perming rods, a good scalp conditioner and moisturizer, and a rattail comb. All of these ingredients can be found at a hair supplies store. If you have anyone who may help you out, it would be good as well. <br>  These are the utensils you will need to do kinky twists. The twists hold up better on kinky hair anyway, so that's actually a plus. Contact me and I can give you step by step instuctions on how to do kinky twists at home. In the mean time, there are many youtube vids that can also check out to get an idea of how you want your hair.|`|gnbJYExqaa	ruff and tuff with your afro puffs;-) or just comb it and stick a pick in it.....or sweep it all to one angle and put a cute pin..idk....have fun with it.<br>  <br>  i dont perm anymore either....perms are whack..|`|8IyZphFVaa	how about a braid-out or twist-out?<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3kjX5Q_XLs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3kjX5Q_X...</a><br>  <br>  twist-out<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqMSdvLZ9aw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqMSdvLZ9...</a>

iZDsMCghaa	My tip is to stay pale. You look good now and you will later on in life,too, unlike your tanning counterparts.The sun is damaging and will increase the rate at which you age. If your young, you may not think it will happen that fast, but it does, not to mention cancer. I used to tan, just last year I was slathering on the oil in a desperate pursuit for some darn color but now I dont think its worth it. I look fine, so do you, Im  married and my husband tells me Im hot every day, why risk cancer? Why risk excess lines on my face? Ill have enough as it is, I'll pass on the extra.<br>  Aside from this, your pale, it will take longer to tan, if you can tan at all. That means extra sun, extra damage.|`|WC2bTHkKaa	don't get a tan.

She'll probably say something about skin cancer, (yes it can happen, BUT) think about it. When you burn, you are at more of a risk for skin cancer. When you tan in a tanning bed, your "sun" exposure is controlled and you are less likely to burn in there. AND When you get a tan, you are less likely to burn in the natural sun. And it produces vitamin D.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly.
