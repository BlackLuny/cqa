The week after that on SD Chris will come out and tell everyone why he's back and that he caused all of Jeff's Accidents, but after the pyro thing he realized that what he was doing was wrong. So told Edge that he was out and then Edge brain washed Matt into be his new partner.

I have heard this term used for sword construction but can find no matching term that means anything or is definitive. The definition I have found on  http://www.samuraisword.com/glossary/ind...   doesn't make much sense. 'Muku-kitae - “ No scale” forging. Using almost pure iron in forging.' BUT  http://www.afuresearch.com/glossary1.htm  lists the term as 'Muku kitae: 無垢鍛え Made of one kind of steel.' I had thought that was a 'maru kitae' lamination. I know that the famed sword smith Masamune used the "Soshu kitae" seven layer construction method. The kanji 無垢鍛え translate to 'Purity tempering' Maybe my japanese and translation skills are shot but I'm at a loss.   A little help, PLEASE.

Mi objetivo es aumentar l masa muscular.   Mi pregunta es: ?lo estoy aciendo bien o hay algo k deba corregir?   En 3 semanas empiezo a tomar las proteinas, con aminoacidos y eso.   Gracias.

20090222113655AAIxjMo	Sports;Golf	I am hitting my irons way to high and I am losing a lot of distance. What should I do?	I am a pretty good golfer. I am a single digit handicapper and a fairly decent ball striker. My problem as of late is I am just hitting all my irons ridiculously high. They are going straight up in the air and I am losing a lot of distance. I used to hit my sand wedge 100 yards and it has decreased over the last year to about 95-90 but in the last week or two it is going 70-75. I also have MP-67 irons which I strike well but they go ridiculously high as well. Not that I don't like that it is just causing me to club up, first off to get a better trajectory and to get it to my target. I have never had this problem before, it just arose in the last week. I think I may be coming down a little steep. I though that was good for pinching the ball, but what can I do to help get more of a sweeping swing, because right now my golf shots consist of good ball striking, huge divots, and high short shots. Thanks.

If you hop over to the Baseball section... every 10 seconds a steroid question is asked. However, I have not seen one in here lately.       Now we all know there has not been any other steroid talk in the other 3 major sports. But if it is running so ramp id in baseball, why wouldn't it be  happening in other sports?       Hockey is without a doubt the most physically demanding sport (If you disagree with that statement, you're crazy). So, for recovery and energy purposes (and hell for any other reason), do you think any pro NHL players use steroids? And do you think eventually it will come out that other players in the other major sports are using?       discuss.

Now, i can play basketball, but like, when i play with really good guys they keep saying "You suck at this, You suck at that". Ive played on a real team only once previously in my life. My family and family friends keep encouraging me to play basketball, because theyre saying it goes with my height. Now, theyre also saying that i still have a chance at a shot at the NBA. (Im not playing on the High school basketball team, because all the "good players" would make a loser out of me.) Now, what should i do? I mean, im really confused. Oh, and, i live in Canada.

Joshua Clottey for and unification fight of the IBF   Andre Berto for a WBC unification   Mosley a WBA unification    Kermit Cintron a all puerto rican showdown by two men who's only defeat are to Margarito.      I personally am not intrested in a mosley rematch The first fight didn't do much for me.  I think clottey deserves the oppurtunity. But I think Cintron is gonna get the fight because it's most money for Cotto. but I personally think best business desicion is Cotto vs Berto. It's a unification fight and he'll still make a bigger cut, plus the winner of Manny vs Hatton. Could be at stake. So Berto is also the least experied.      What fight do u think he should take June 13th
