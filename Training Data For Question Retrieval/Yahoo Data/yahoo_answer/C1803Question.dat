Also in the R-Click menu, while browsing folders, there is no "New > Zip(Compressed Folder)" option.
20090202201351AAa6q1T	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Ethernet does not work?	Hey, one of my friends is having an Ethernet issue. He has an Asus P5L MX motherboard running Windows XP, its been working good for 2 years and all the sudden the ethernet on it stops working, I read on Newegg that if you overclock past a certain FSB the ethernet stops working but he doesn't overclock. It doesn't appear in the Device manager but when he hits show hidden devices it does, so I had to have him uninstall the device and reinstall it, however upon attempting to uninstall the device he got an error saying "The computer must be booted on". So after a lot of frustration he just decided to go and get a new ethernet card. He bought a Dynex DX-e102. After he installed it he installed the drivers and the computer did not detect it. I had him go into his BIOS and disable the onboard lan, and it still did not detect it. The lights on the back of card blink, so it seems to be installed properly. Then I had him go into his BIOS and enable PCI PnP, which, did nothing. So with no other options he sacrificed his data and reinstalled Windows XP, which yielded no results, even after installing the drivers. So we are currently completely clueless on what this might be, does anyone have any idea?

20090202215230AAShNoV	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop issue, weird grinding if tilted?	I'm about irritated with this, and i've learned that online support is ****, even with Dell.      I went online one day, and all of a sudden my computer started to grind on the left side. Like my fan was whirling out of control, I don't know what the heck it was. I spoke to Dell about it and they said it was because my BIOS wasn't updated..      OK! I did this and I'm still getting the issue. For the past few days i've realised what the issue and how it's starting. If my laptop gets tilted from, unleveled sometimes on the left side of it started going crazy. It's grinds and sounds like something is spinning out of control in here.       sadly this makes me pissed off. I asked dell over and over again if it's a problem inside that I need it taken care of asap because my warrenty is about to expire. Well guess what? It's done expiered and the issue is still happening. Now because Dell's online support is complete ****, I now have to pay for the damn problem.      Thanks Dell, your a great frickin help :)      Any ideas what this might be? I'm suspecting something might be out of line..I mean the laptop is just over a year old, and yeah it's used a lot but I mean come on. Anyways..sorry for the half rant this is just irritating and I feel to be the only person with this issue since I couldn't find jack all online.

20070509150610AAAtydl	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Why does my computer not recognize my password when it hibernates but if I reboot it works fine?	I am running Windows XP Pro at home with 3 users.       If we leave the machine alone, it automatically kicks out to the login page after a few hours. But when we try to log back in, it acts like we are putting in the wrong password. We get the pop up asking if we forgot our password.    At this point, if we reboot it will let us log in with our passwords.       If we use the "Log Off" feature, there are no problems with logging back in using the passwords.       I have removed the screensaver and powersave features so that the machine should not require a password other than the one to login but it still kicks out to the Welcome screen after sitting for awhile.       Help!!!

Hello,  I want to create a template for some ebay auctions in dreamweaver but I'm a little confused how to do it.  I can create all design in dreamweaver thats not a problem.  What I'm confused on is how do I link or embed the pictures I want to use so they will show up in ebay.  I have normally used flickr to host images then i'd link or embed the images when I set up the auction in ebay.       I'd like to be able to upload the pictures to either flickr or my web server but when you insert pictures in dreamweaver it automatically sets it up as if you are going to upload that page to your web server I am basically trying to create a template in dreamweaver then copy the html and paste it into the drescription portion on the ebay listing menu. However none of the pictures will link correctly if I do it this way.      Does  anyone know how to set up the pictures so they link to an outside webserver but still shows up on your html without handcoding       thanks in advance

20070610170904AAFQKfJ	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Best Audio Quality?	What do you all think is the best audio quality for a sound file?  I have always thought 128 Mp3 was good enough, and I listen usually through burned CDs in a car stereo, through my iPod to home stereo, or just iPod headphones.  It's very space efficient too; I couldn't believe how much hard drive space I saved converting a lot of my 320kbps files to 128..but my real question is..    Am I missing out?  Am I sacrificing a lot of quality staying at 128 mp3..I've experimented with the same file at 320 then converted to 128 and I don't think I notice a difference...am I not listening hard enough?  AAC didn't seem much different to me either.

I am a college student who hardly gets time for his extracurricular work. Trying to merge the two together, it would be possible for me to work in college,(or study at work) and thus save a lot of time.      For my work, all I really need is a software which creates pdf documents.(Like adobe acrobat professional version 8), and an internet connection. and for studies, I needed a phone that will allow me to program on the phone.      I wanted to buy a phone to do this, but now I know that cell phone softwares are limited...and that when they mean windows os on a cell phone, i would not be able to work all of my windows applications on the phone.      So, I am very confused ! Is there a phone out there(sony, nokia, o2, whatever it is) that will allow me to do both of these things (or either of these things?) .       Please let me know if there is any phone like that out there, or any software, because I'll buy that phone no matter what be its cost. Thanks.

I think I want to get a job when I'm older where I work on them, or I make programs, or I make new hardware, whatever!    I said something about this to a classmate and he flat out told me that you need to know math and be a computer person (I'm sure this doesn't cover hardware stuff, but just in case I wanted to do programming).    So, do I need to know any maths?  I really suck at them, and right now my opinion is that I'll always have some sort of calculator available or I'll be able to research a math question without having to actually do it (i know this is a bad philosophy, but I can't change it at this point).    So, after reading that novel, basically this: Am I screwed for being some type of computer guy if I can't do math?    (A couple years ago I looked up some HTML stuff.  I didn't really stick with it, but I didn't do horrible.  It was all basic stuff though, like background colors and pictures, changing text.  I was in 7th grade at the time)

Just incase if one of them are going to act up. >;|   Right now I had to use Explorer because Firefox was being very slow.   But the thing I don't understand is why whenever I type in YahooAnswers or Google on the Internet Explorer search bar, it will just open up a new tab on Firefox and that's not what I need because Firefox was being slow at the time so I decided to use Explorer...So why is it that whenever I try to open Explorer and type in something on it's searchbar I end up having Firefox popup and take me to the webpage I typed in on Explorer. This didn't happen before and I want to be able to use Explorer without having Firefox pop up outta nowhere...Keep in mind I needed to use Explorer for a reason and that's when Firefox was being slow...   What to do? I don't want to uninstall either of the programs because it hasn't done this before and I need these incase one of them aren't working...

20090202205548AAX1Ac3	Computers & Internet;Security	IMPORTANT!  I'm trying to get rid of a computer virus...?	So basically, I'm kinda freaked out cause I got this trojan virus and I'm not supposed to delete it (I already tried and it freezed up my computer...) and Norton Antivirus gave me a link to download this like virus remover.  It's fine, but for some reason, my main account doesn't have "network administration"...    Now, I know my account is the administrative account and not the standard one, so I'm wondering why this isn't working.  Perhaps the virus is doing something?  Or network administration is something I've never heard about?  Anyways, please tell me how to do this.  I usually don't have computer problems, in fact when people have viruses I'm the one to remove it for them.  It's not really affecting me, but I don't know what it might do later on or something, so I really want to get rid of it.  It's also high risk, which is just scary lol.

I'm not sure about a technical school or a university yet but I know I want to be able to design and develop websites. Should I just pursue a Computer Science degree and take some web/graphic design classes on the side?      I hope to open a web design and development business in the future too.

But then after I uninstalled them, my free space indicator DIDN'T GO UP.      I am having a single C:/ for data on my laptop which has a total of 138 Gb (The free space indicator says so, in My Computer.). Now it says I have 101 Gb free. OK fine. But when I selected all folders in C:/ (including those hidden), all those amount to just 17.0 Gb! I dont know what takes the rest of my space!      I deleted those files in Recycle Bin as well as on TEMP folder. Should I delete anymore? I just bought this laptop and haven't much about saved any files in it. I can't understand it. The main problem is the free space indicaor.      I ran the Disk cleanup and it told it freed around 400 MB but there was no change in free space (on the free space indicator).   Any program out there which tells my real free disk space.    PLEASE HELLPPP!!!!

20090202195527AAO3okP	Computers & Internet;Software	I need help with an excel 2003 count formula. (SUM PRODUCT) And array reference issues.?	SUMPRODUCT(--(Sheet1!$A$2:$A$1500="3970"...       is what i am using to count data and it works fine.       However if i change "3970" to Sheet2!A2 (which happens to have the number 3970 in it), my count is wrong and comes out as zero.    My question is weather or not there is a way to put a cell reference in that part of the array.    I want to compare it to the cell so that i can change the cell value and so that I can copy and paste the formula over 100+ rows.      I have excel 2007 at home and it works so much better, but we only have 03 at work. I also understand the dbase and pivot table that would be a great recommendation, but as you can tell I pull my data from sheet 1 which is populated by an older 3rd party program that won't allow for the easy way out, and only exports simple excel files.      Thanks for your help.

20090202205855AA9L35Y	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Need help with ascending numbers program in c++ please.?	Write a program where the user enters numbers (doubles) on standard input. All of these numbers should be greater than zero, except for the last one, which should be -1. The -1 is a sentinel value and is how the user signals that he or she is done entering numbers.  Your program should read in all of these numbers, and print out one of three things after the user enters -1:    If the numbers are in ascending order (each number is greater than the previous one), then print "Ascending."  If the numbers are in descending order (each number is less than the previous one), then print "Descending."  If the numbers are neither ascending or descending, then print "No Order."  Ignore the final -1 in all three cases. Do print the period.    Your program must print its output after reading the -1, even though it may be able to determine that the input is in "No Order" after only a few numbers have been read.    You may assume that you always get legal input. You always get at least two numbers greater than zero, and the last number is always -1.      I am having problems with this for my cs102 class. Could anyone help?

20090202211337AAPfKlE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	8400GS or 6200OC in an Old Dell 2450?	i want to add a video card to my 6 y.o. old dell 2450 and have spent a lot of time researching and asking what to get...   first, PleasE Don't tell me to upgrade my PSU or get a new puter!...i have a very limited budget and want to only add the new video card for now.   to make a loooong story short as possible, i know that i only have a 200W PSU but two specific video cards have been recommended and seem most likely will work for me, but i'd like some opinions from here too :)   i've narrowed it down to a Sparkle GeForce 8400GS and a eVGA 6200OC, but i keep reading that the 8400 will require too much from my meager PSU, but that one does seem like the best bang-for-the-buck. the 8400 spec sheet says that it needs a 300W PSU and the 6200 says it needs a 250W PSU, but both have been recommended by sources i trust, but again, i'd like more opinions.   btw...i'm not heavily into gaming, but once in awhile i do go to a SIM site mainly to listen to live music being performed (SL) that requires more than the integrated stuff i have now.

20090202212944AAkRNLS	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Is this the easiest way to upgrade my power supply?	Here what I would do. I would take to power supply out of case and lay it safely outside the case while the wires are in place so that when putting the new power supply in i wont forget which cable to plug into whatever slot. Is that a good way to not get confused? Is it as easy as that? I think i can upgrade the power supply because me and my dad once too the entire power supply out when we blew all the dust out of it and also took the cpu off to blow that cpu fan off then put it back on and the computer worked better. Im putting a graphics card in it so i need a bigger power supply. Is it about as easy as plugging a cable in?
