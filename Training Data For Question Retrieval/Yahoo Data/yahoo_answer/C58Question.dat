20090304165629AAObEgc	Politics & Government;Politics	Would our country be much better off right now if the government had less control over individual states?	Seems the more control the government has over our united states, the worse off we get. Everything from abortion to gay marriage to health insurance to tax laws.      Why should the residents of one state be held responsible for the mistakes of another?       Each state should be allowed to make their owns laws (as it used to be) without forcing those in one to live by those in another.       Seems the more control our government has over all states, the more we are divided.

For me, I think the "Punish Success and Redistribute Wealth" policy is a great thing.      I'm not a wealthy, successful, hard working person...in fact, some might call me lazy...so I stand to benefit from this policy.      Take money from those who are already paying the overwhelming majority of taxes and give it to people like me who contribute little to nothing to society!      Rich people are evil people (except for Hollywood lefties of course!)      Punishing success is the only way to make this country great again!      "Yes We Did!"

20090304174943AArYFB6	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does the US Constitution apply to every legal US citizen or not?	Click on the link below,    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhuYVAN5B...       In my opinion, the answer is a no-brainer. he should DEFINTIELY keep the money. If he can't, then that's discrimination and a violation to his Constitutional rights as a US citizen. Just because he did a few bad things and served his time, doesn't mean he can't keep that money. If he can't, then he's not a real US citizen anymore and may as well be deported. It you are going to have legal rights taken away from you as a US citizen, then you don't have equal rights, you may as be deported...      I am disgusted by those people in that video that said he shouldn't be allowed to keep the money. He bought the ticket, he served his time and paid he debts back to society, and he got lucky and won,         Did he keep the money? If not, then that's unlawful discrimination and a violation to his rights as an American....

20090304224827AASOP10	Politics & Government;Elections	How dumb do the anti-socialism arguments against Obama sound?	Are you people high on coffee?      Socialisim has already been around in America for a pretty long time. This country could not thrive on pure Capitalism and it isn't a pure Capitalist country.      The arguments are coming from foxnews which pretty much says it all. These people backed every blunder Bush made and since before the major elections they have shown their bias against Obama, liberals and democrats. Every time I check up foxnews there's an article somewhere usually by Glen Beck or O'reilly with a really antagonist message which can easily be seen as an effort to rally the audiences against the Obama admin.. which isn't what the country needs right now.      Even within a week of him becoming president the foxnews network were actively opposing, criticizing and spitting out all sorts of 'conspiracy' theories and propaganda. It's ridiculous how the foxnews crew so instantly switch from being loyal a**laves for the government into unfed wild dogs within a single transfer of power.      Right now what this country needs is to accept that Obama is president, as we had to accept Bush was our president, and contribute our efforts into fixing the damages made to this country, not tear ourselves apart with our disagreements.

My cousin the economists Thoughts on it (word for word)      Sounds like a plan!      Bet it would reduce the tax code from over 1.1 million words to 139 pages. Explainable on one 3x5 card. So Transparent!      Would bring $11 trillion dollars home in offshore savings accounts.      Would make our products really competitive on the world market.      Everybody would pay, the rich pay more than the poor, and even our visitors would contribute!      We reduce the number of tax collection points from 100 million to just over 50 (states, the district, and territories)      We get a 20-30% boost in collectable taxes and fully fund the Federal Budget, Social Security, and Medicare.      We greatly reduce the IRS budget of $10 billion!   And NEVER fear them again! (I have been audited - be afraid -   BE VERY AFRAID!)      Make April 15th just another spring day!

20090304221617AAwboU9	Politics & Government;Politics	New Labour and continuous PR blunders?	It seems to me that New Labor is continuously making constant PR blunders. Which show they are not handling this economic crisis clearly. Constantly it seems wheeling out Mandelson to respond is losing it glow and showing that Labour don't have any one else credible to respond. And the handling of many events i think have been bad such as Gordon Browns visit to America, as well.      For a recent example here is Mandelson on newsnight last night giving an interview in his tuxedo, in a Mansion after his speech to the city of London and with the clearly party going on behind him.   it just looks bad whislt talking about the economic crisis. And even the media savvy Mandelson should know so!        http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_po...      Claims that New Labour have lost touch but also they have lost all there skills and management of PR, that brought them to power?

20090304232507AA8rlWh	Politics & Government;Politics	Is it fair to say that conservatives = narrow-minded, and liberals = broad-minded?	Aren't liberals more likely to be pluralistic and tolerant toward other's differences, and aren't conservatives more likely to be intolerant and bigoted?      Think about it.      It's conservatives that don't want gays to get married. They don't want gays to have the same rights as everyone else. And those that are more conservatives don't even think gay people are really "gay" but are rather corrupted by some kind of immorality. Heterosexual liberals on the other hand, have the stance of "it's your life, and as long as you are not hurting anyone, then we shouldn't infringe upon it". Conservatives state that they should infringe upon homosexual's rights.      During segregation, who were the conservatives, and who were the liberals? The conservatives wanted to maintain Jim Crow laws, while liberals wanted break free from segregation.      The conservatives wanted to maintain slavery, while liberals were the abolishonists.      But let's also look at the definition and etymology of the word itself.      Liberal - comes from the Latin word "Liberus", and "liber" means "free". Liberals put freedom first, and want everyone to enjoy the same freedoms.      Conservative - comes from the Latin word conservare, meaning, "to keep, preserve". Conservatives are afraid of change and still want to maintain the status quo, even in the status quo is the problem and is wrong. Conservatives are thus less likely to be progressive than liberals.      You can even compare Obama & Bush's style of governing. Obama is constantly reaching out and looking for a wide array of ideas & input, including Republican ideas -- a "tolerant" and pluralistic liberal. Bush on the otherhand was polarizing towards non-Republicans, or towards Republicans with different opinions -- a "narrow-minded" conservative.      This is why conservativism is dying and Republicans continue to lose seats in the House & Senate. Democrats are only 1 seat away from a fillibuster-proof majority in the Senate. It appears Democrats will win more seats in next year's elections.      Your thoughts.

I thought, "oh great! since he's happy with that toy, i can squeeze in a minute to apply for a job" needless to say, the app was very long and had a 25 min questionare, my son began to get antsy and we had been at the store for a long time, we needed to go. i grabbed my purse and pushed my screaming son out of the store....forgetting about the toy all together! a loss prevention person stopped me and i was tresspassed from the store and given a court date. im so humiliated! i didnt need to steal the toy! 1, i had money to pay for it, 2 he has that toy already in a diff size, and 3, why would i steal from a job that was applying for?ugh! so what am i looking at to happen when i go to court??????

20090304230705AAx9L1j	Politics & Government;Military	Tips on managing army reserves and school or work?	Im currently in the reserves with 2 years left, getting married soon and also in college with 2 years left, i joined from the IRR so i could finish my initial 8 years and also nondeployable due to voluntary joining to the reserves so i wont deploy with my unit until my resrerve time is up so im not worried about that. Now i love the drill weekends, there fun, and the extra paycheck helps out since i only work part time, but my reenlistment is coming up and even though i love being a soldier i feel its gonna interfere when i pursue graduate school or get hired by that high paying job that i want, ive been getting alot of negative feedback from my buddies also in the reserves who are working at respected law and accounting firms and how the reserves screwed up their promotions and raises b/c they had to leave on fridays for 3 day drills and the 2 summer weeks, and how the company told them they had to use their vacation days to take them and how the time away doesnt look good to their management.  Anyone got tips from personal experience on how they dealt with this situation or how their doing now and anything that could ease my mind as far as staying in and dealing with the interferences or just not reenlisting.

If you put me (poor) and Bill Gates in a room and drop a twenty dollar bill in I'd be willing to fight for it where as I am sure Gates would just let me take it. He doesn't have any incentive to make any more money, or rather he doesn't have nearly as much drive as any of the poor do to become rich.      So why are we not setting the sights on the poor for benefits instead of the rich? Or why is this just crazy.

20090305020613AAxfnYg	Politics & Government;Military	Spouse has PTSD. I don't know what to do anymore...?	My husband served 2 tours in Iraq. After his last tour he got out of the Army quickly due to stop loss. We have been together for 9 years and been married for 3. I am 25 and he is 26.       He has been diagnosed with a pretty severe case of PTSD. He was an infantryman. He hasn't been the same since his first tour, but I thought since his second tour was so much better he would come back and be cured. I don't know what fantasy world I was living in. The whole time he was gone I talked and wrote to the old husband. The one I grew up with and married. The man I knew like the back of my hand. We meshed together so well, we were perfect, not fairy tale perfect as I don't have illusions of a perfect life, but as perfect as two people can be together.       Then he came home.      At first we were fine. We were so happy to be together that we overlooked all the changes in each other. Yet, as time wore on, we have started to argue more and more. We are to the point where we argue every day, we rarely touch or kiss, and we hardly talk. We have started to resent each other for I don't know what reason! He is far more hateful than he has ever been. He used to be sweet, while I was the edgier one. Now we are both angry at each other all the time.      My questions are: Has anyone else been in this situation, does it get better, and  how do you think we can stop our relationship from spiraling towards disaster until his PTSD lets up some or until I get better used to it?       We are out of the army now, as I stated, and neither of us have jobs as the restaurant I worked for closed down & we have not been able to find any. Neither of have insurance or money. In fact we are having to move out at the end of the month as we can no longer afford our place. Because of these reasons we are not able to see a professional as I would like to. I know that it would be the best thing, but it is not possible at this time.
20090305011134AAnGk64	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	If I started a revolution (peaceful, with words) would you join me?	The bureaucracy in Washington has me just about on the verge on mental breakdown.  Anyone who says that Obama isn't just another puppet hanging from the strings of the rich and powerful corporations of this country (and China, by the way) is severely deluded and deserves nothing more than the undeniable ignorance they already display.  I think too many people in this country are slaves of the media and the entertainment industry; slaves of introspection; slaves of superficiality; slaves of limited consciousness.  We have been brainwashed, folks.  If you argue that we have not, then you obviously have a very limited knowledge of American history (especially the past fifty years, and more importantly the last six) and can voice your opinions but they will be disregarded and labeled ignorant and incessant, uneducated regurgitation by this man.        We've been force-fed lies our entire lives.  Lies in our textbooks, lies on our televisions, lies in our newspapers, lies, lies, and more lies.  Some of us are just now, in this new age of enlightenment and disclosure, being made aware of the truth behind this country's evil intentions across the world.        The imperialist, power hungry, greedy, self-interested and positively despicable evil men that run this country deserve nothing better than a big boot out of office and shackles on their arms and legs.  I do not, by any means, condone violence towards these evil men.  You cannot fight fire with fire, but we can voice our opinions.  It is our right to speak out.  It is our right to petition our government.  It is our right, undeniably, if we see fit, to replace our government with one that WILL uphold the constitution.      Obama has done nothing to hold the prior administration accountable for their actions.  Our rights were robbed of us.  They were robbed of us in the name of "security" and we allowed it.  Through ignorance and complacency we have allowed our inherent rights to fall to the floor and splash upon the ground like water through our fingers.  If nothing is done, our rights will eventually "evaporate" and be gone forever.  If no action is taken, they will only continue to strip us of our rights in an effort to gain more control over us; to use our tax dollars to drive their war machine all over the world and leave behind them a trail of death, tears and unimaginable horror.      Be empathetic, be aware, be conscious.      I leave you with a quote: “The individual who refuses to defend his rights when called by his government deserves to be a slave, and must be punished as an enemy of his country and a friend to her foe” - Andrew Jackson

20090305011937AADQLGR	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Why are Americans so against an "overall healthcare plan" and higher taxes?	I know this is a touchy subject, and when I lived in the states (born and raised) I would agree, screw higher taxes and my money is my money!!      I've lived in Germany for going on 7 years now, 4 active duty Army and 3 as a civilian on the german economy.  I must say the german way does have a lot of downfalls, but overall everything is SO much better for the people.      First of all, stop complaining about your 9% sales tax.  Over here it's 19%, and will be going up in the near future.  We pay road tax on our vehicles every year and could be up to 400 euros per year, depending on the size of your vehicle.  This is why you don't see a million Tahoes and Suburbans driving around.  Germans realized they're a waste.      My point is, Germans pay out the *** for almost everything.  If you're single and 25, your tax bracket is around 45%.  That's money you will not see again!  It's also illegal NOT to have healthcare here.      The bottom line is EVERYBODY suffers together, and the country as a WHOLE gets better.  The roads are beautiful (you couldn't drive 140 MPH on stateside roads), most places are cleanier, if you have a job; have healthcare, no matter how many hours worked, or for what company!      My point is, America could see how a lot of European countries are doing it, copy the good stuff and also prevent the downfalls that we deal with.      But the main problem with the taxes is, there's too many people NOT paying taxes but living off of everyone else's tax money.  This needs to stop for a social govt. to work!      Rant over!

So, if someone drives drunk, it should be acceptable without punishment.      However, if that person gets into an accident where the fault is at least 50% his/her, then that person should receive the death penalty.      Do you think that will deter drunk driving in the long-run?

20090305010136AArGl8L	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	I live in Houston tx and got caught stealing 700.00 worth of stuff. How much jail time will i get?	I got caught making a bad decision. What I was doing is letting another co-worker come through my line at a grocery store and  i would scan everything but her beer and diapers etc.. ( non foodstamp items). Today they called me into the office and brought in the loss and prevention workers to question me. I was sat in a room with Sam (Loss and prevention) and 2 of my managers (Kendall and Frank). They started questioning me saying how i better tell the truth because honnesty goes alot further and they had all this evidence on me. They asked me how much money i had caused my company to loose. I had told them I didnt know but they made me give them an answer.. they then started asking me about merhandise like beer... they asked me questions like which brand? how many? how much was the beer? how much in ____ period of time? for how long? ...I told them i didnt know but they told me they needed an answer. They did this to me with everything.. They then told me to write my statement but  i could write whatever i wanted because it was myne. They made me re-write my statement 3x saying I didnt have enough in it. In one place i had mentioned that some of the stuff had been given to a coworker (not wanting to give out her name) and they made me add her name.. They started calculating everything without taking out and showing me any evidense at all and came up with a total of 700.00 and something. I accept the consequences of my bad decisions and i understand i must pay the price for what i did. They gave me 9 months to pay it back.. my thing is how can they tell me to pay back the right amount when they dont even know which brands of stuff i was letting people take.. I feel like psycology was used on me and i do not feel like i was done right. I had even left and got down the hallway and Sam called me back because he had wanted me to add stuff to my statement.. My question is basically.. does this sound right? I already signed the papers but  i wasnt even given a copy.. is it too late to do anything?   Another question is.. I turned 17 this past nov. on the 21st. This is my first offence.. am i looking at juvie jail or the big jail? How much jail time do you think this will mean for me???? I cannot pay this because I pay everything else myself and my parents do not help me..   How do i go about this? do I just call up to my work and ask to speak with Frank (main mgr) and tell him i cant pay.. to come arrest me???????? PLEASE HELP. i am very desperate for an answer.. I cannot afford an attorney.

20090305033946AAVRd5D	Politics & Government;Politics	Was the whole Michael Steele criticism/apology thing just a setup?	Was it orchestrated to cause the administration to tout Rush as the real leader of the Republican party, and thus look more foolish in refusing to debate him?
20090305033600AABHyR5	Politics & Government;Politics	Did Rush play Obama like an accordion?	Obama gets into office and immediately starts campaigning against a talk show host. He starts giving his talking points/marching orders to the sycophant media badmouthing Rush. He promotes Rush as the face of Republicanism.      Rush responds with the provocative sounding statement that he hopes Obama fails, which set the dogs baying. A real media frenzy. Nearly the only thing they're talking about.      The effect of all this is to drive Rush's audience numbers through the roof and to make it appear that the Obama administration considers Rush to be the most significant member of the opposition party.      Then Rush challenges Obama to a debate in front of his inflated audience. The terms of the debate both preempt objections and highlight Rush's criticisms of Obama. Obama cannot accept the debate, especially under those terms, but any objection either has already been addressed or can be easily conceded to.       Obama's only recourse is to reverse what he has been saying for the last couple weeks about Rush running the party and return to Clinton's tactic of  "Rush is just an entertainer"

This was the suggestion by the former head of MI5, and recently UK plc has adopted the Zimbabwean police state methods of financing a bancrupt economy, printing cash. Is the UK a police state ?

20090305030324AAoyU8q	Politics & Government;Government	Why should the government help car makers ?	Cars are a social menace, causing accidents and pollution. Cars wreck lives. Cars are noisy and disturb pedestrians and cyclists. Cars make people lazy and greedy. Because people use cars, public transport suffers. Why should the government pay towards car making ? Instead the money could create millions of better jobs and serve the public by being invested in public transport. What on earth is wrong with the government to come up with such a ridiculous idea as to give money to car manufactures (and banks) is the government bonkers ? How can UK business compete with germany when they have better public transport and lower taxes ? I am boggled by the latest government nonsnese and misappropriation of cash ! Maybe there will be cash back deals to ministers, perhaps this is explained by simple corruption ?

That is besides rolling in the hay with their cousin.

The picture on my big screen tv was getting a little discolored and I called a repairman to come look at it. He said it was some circut board and he would charge $600 to replace. My wife agreed. he took out the circut board and left. 2 weeks later he tried to install the new piece and said he needed to take the whole tv in, cause there might be something else wrong. Well that was 6 mos. ago. He won't return my calls and when I talk to him he said he shipped the part to Mitsubishi factory in China or somewhere and is waiting to get it back. I think he sold my tv or he took out all the parts and used them to fix other tvs. What recourse do I have? Can I call the police or is that something they don't get involved with. Can I sue him? If so for how much? The price of a new one?
