While you're about to make a left or a right turn and the car behind you gives you way, once you completed the turn, is it true that by turning on the Emergency Signal is a way to say Thank You? I've done that a few times, but I don't know if the other driver knows it or not. Lol I don't know if this applies here in the states, but that's how it is when I was living in South Africa.      What do you guys think?

20090225092241AAygfLr	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	Chevy Colorado air conditioning and rear back up light problems?	Hello, I have a 2004 Chevy Colorado Inline 5 cylinder ext cab truck in which I am having complications with the air conditioning unit and also the rear drivers side white back up light. The air conditioner(not climate control) will always work on the highest setting(4), but will rarely work on the 3 other fan levels. There are times where settings 1-3 work, but it's only when the truck wants it to(it seems to have a mind of it's own), but the highest setting works 100% of the time. The second problem I am having is the rear drivers side white back up light which will not work at all. I replaced both bulbs and that did not solve the problem and now I am asking for your help to help me solve these problems without going to a costly dealership. I do not know if the fuses are bad or if there is something more serious that is wrong. The fuse #'s I have wrote down which could be the problem are:   Fuse #5 for the air conditioning control head   Fuse #26 for the back up lights   Fuse #29 for the drivers side rear tail lamp, and   Fuse #61 for the Back-Up lamps   I am no where close to being a mechanic and am in much needed help on solving these problems, so if anyone who owns a Colorado and has had similar problems are if you are a mechanic that could help me out I would greatly appreciate it.   Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.      Zack

20090225094436AARMoCC	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Do I have to pay for a broken down car I never agreed to buy?	My aunt gave me a car (98 Camry) in the summer of 2005 so that I would be able to drive back and forth to see my parents. She told me that she was keeping the car in her name so that I would take care of it, and I naively accepted the car.      I drove the car for 3 years without incident.  After I graduated from college, she suddenly wanted money for the car, or the car back.  I wasn't expecting this at all -- I guess she thought I'd hop out of undergraduate and into an executive position or something, but it was the shadiest thing anyone has ever done to me. Especially since I really needed the car. We never signed an agreement for me to pay for the car, and I drove it for 3 years without being asked for money. I always paid the insurance. She did pay the registration (always said it would be my birthday present), and kept the car in her name.      Do I have any legal obligation to pay her, especially since there is no written agreement? I live in Kentucky, she lives in Ohio.      After all of this, the transmission went out, and now I need a new car on top of the fact that she is breathing down my neck for "money, or the car back in it's original condition."

20090225100449AAiUc5V	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Is there any way to request not to have a specific examiner for a driving test?	I had a driving test yesterday, and like most people got very very nervous during the test, so much so that my leg started almost jumping up and down. This was during a left reverse manoeuvre, the examiner had parked me outside of a nursery and it was letting out time so I had women crossing the road with pushchairs and in my mind, with my leg as bad as it was, it was best to stop and just wait for them to go and wait for my leg to stop shaking, but this examiner, very angrily told me to carry on. This happened all throughout the test, I would make one little mistake (a minor) and I was told about this minor, in my opinion with a test this is wrong, but I really can't be bothered to report him, because I wouldn't be able to stand on two feet, as there is no proof.      What I am asking is, if I go for my next test, and I have this examiner, I will fail before getting in the car. I will expect the same rudeness and unkindness that I got before, and my nerves will be shot. Is there any way that I can request not to have this specific examiner due to how badly he well... scared me pretty much?       Please help me, as I want to book another test asap. I know I can drive well, but with this examiner I drove the worst I have ever driven (that even includes my first time in a car). Kirsty

Und die meisten Auto haben 2 Liter Hubraum und fahren mit durchschnittlich 3500 Umdrehungen je Minute.    Das hei?t der Motor verbraucht jede Minute 7000 Liter Atemluft und verbrennt den darin enthaltenen Sauerstoff!   7000 Liter sind sieben Kubikmeter und das jede Betriebsminute eines 2 Liter Autos, wie beschrieben.       50000 Fahrzeugen machen somit in EINER STUNDE den Sauerstoff eines Luftvolumens von 360000 Kubikmetern platt    (Das ist der Rauminhalt von Schwimmbecken mit 10 x 5 Meter Gr??e und 140 cm Tiefe).   Von den zus?tzlichen Schadstoffen abgesehen!      Sollte der Benzinpreis somit aus Umweltgründen auf 5  Euro je Liter erh?t werden?

He was a train conductor and there were one of two problems,      1) The person who didn't have enough money for their train fare let him know apologizing saying they thought they had enough money and asked if they could just get off at the next stop.      2) The person who doesn't have enough money for their train fare tells Stone Cold to just take the damn change and they throw change right in his face and they call him an ugly son of a bit#ch.         Out of these two different scenarios, what do you think Stone Cold Steve Austin would do?

The car had to be ordered from the factory because of the extras and they had found a similar car to what i wanted already built but i had an extra 6 cd changer and Dab radio built in which i had not ordered on my car. Therefore the sales woman rang me and said they had found me a car but it had two extras which were a cd changer and DAB radio, she said they cost 500 but they will give them to me for free. Now the car has been delivered to the dealers and all the finance paper work has been signed and the 20,000 cash has been paid the sales person now says i still owe them 550 pounds before i can collect the car for the cd changer which i was told that it was going to be thrown in for free. They say i either pay it and have the car that is delivered or they have to order me a new one from factory and the prices have risen this week for the same vehicle and i would be subject to new prices if i decided to buy the one i ordered previously. What do i do now ? where do i stand ??? i never signed nothing to state that i had ordered a cd changer i have sorted all my insurance and everything on the car which i was supposed to collect on sunday. Could you please advice on where do i stand in this situation ?
