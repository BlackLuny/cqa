AA11276475	make sure you have a certified plastic surgeon. The surgery usually costs about 2500.00 if you only want your eyelids returned to pre-babby state. Make sure you are not over done, as it takes years to close your eyes if you are. Depending upon age, results are good from 5 to 10 years. why have tired looking eyes when fresh eyes are so cheap.   Pain...all but none. With the glues they use today, very little bleeding..make sure your surgeon uses glues!!! Use cold compresses for about 4 days, DO NOT SMOKE!!! If you smoke, you MUST not be smoking when you do plastic surgery. Healing will be retarded and scarring can occur!  Pain killers are given, this is out patient surgery...have someone to drop you off and pick you up. No problems. Do NOT take IBuprofen or aspirin or any blood thinners OR Vitamin E for 10 days prior to surgery.

qtEv2FgPaa	You've reached the perfect person to ask, sunce I "naturally" curl my hair all the times. Right after you take a shower, braid your hair into about 4-7 depending how curly you want it to look, and make sure they are not too thin and not too thick. (You're goig to look kind of freaky) Apply either dry conditioning spray, or just any hair mousturizer, than blow dry your hair for a while, and go to sleep with it, I suggest you do this AT NIGHT. Then in the morning, blow dry it more, and SLOWLY and cAREFULLLY take of the braids, seperate them and comb them, and again, blow dry it. Then that should be it... ! ^.^|`|7h0gS8jSaa	ummm....natural is natural...right? u cant change that. get a perm.
61KFF8svaa	I agree with what you are saying. There are also many different forms of beauty. Someone can be considered beautiful in one culture and not be in another. The world and its people are so diverse that it would be too difficult to pinpoint "the most beautiful person."  I would hate too think that there would only be one right way too look and anyways physical beauty is only half of it.  A person can be beautiful on the outside, but be less than ideal as a person.  I think that beauty is a combination of the exterior and the interior, with the interior counting for more.  Beauty is also such an instable thing.  Someone can be considered beautiful on the outside and that can change very quickly due to aging or damage.  We are very fagile as human being and likewise the nature of beauty is similarly fagile. For that reason, I think that there cannot be a "most beautiful woman" in the world.|`|xmDxtcvaaa	"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder".    We're all fairly familiar with that saying, a woman may be drop dead gorgeous to someone, and absolutely hideous to the next. In our modern society, we're told that there's always a best, and 1st place. Beauty isn't measured by a first or second prettiest.     Everyone has something beautiful about them, sometimes we just have to look deep enough to find it.|`|KBN0c1fbaa	Not really, because different people see beauty in different ways. There's not such thing as a perfect girl that will be beautiful for everyone.    Every girl can be the "most beautiful woman in the world", they just have to find the right guy who is able to see how unique she is. That's what makes girls so great!!|`|Gou7exmIaa	right you are|`|7dEh2khhaa	i think that you are right, but there is one " most beautiful women in the world" to everyone.  whether it be a celebrty,a spouse/girlfriend or a random women this person has seen on the street it depends!  i hope i helped.  zoe sampson    if you have any questions about anything ( or you just need to talk) feel free to e-mail me at helpfromzoesampson@yahoo.com|`|721695e3dcd9012bb76a9ae7c375da13aa	As the cliche says: beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|tTnX75Eiaa	i think every1 is beautiful in 1 way or another.  we dont need some bunch of people to judge us and tell us that we r not.|`|ManVZVJzaa	I definitely agree with you.  Beauty is subjective.  What's beautiful for one may not necessarily be the same for another.|`|BYGsYOdLaa	hell yeah!!! right on!
aEXwIrCCaa	If the roots get oily, wash it every day but just use a mild shampoo.  And only lather the scalp, dont irritate the ends too much.      Then condition the ends daily.  Get a good detangling spray (for wet or dry hair) if knots are a problem for you.  And most importantly, comb it when its wet!  Do not brush!  Brushing it when its wet will cause breakage and damage and be a huge disaster for long hair.    Get it trimmed every 5 weeks to keep the ends healthy.|`|81l4Vetpaa	I definitely don't wash it daily... every other day. Then I put some oil-based "shine" product on the ends... away from the scalp to keep it from drying out as this hair is years-old. But it's all going to depend on your hair...oily, dry, etc. Ask your hairstylist to recommend products.|`|otzk8vg2aa	hey..................for more info................ check out the below mentioned website...........i think it will help uuuuuuuuuuuuu

AA11850523	my natural color would be  dark brown  my stylist  dyes  the base color of golden medium brown    adding  golden blond , and light brown highlights to the top and sides where I am going  gray  to blend it all in  I only have to get the hightlights every 6-7 months  the brownish base color every 8-9 weeks|`|Og4Rxy0iaa	My best suggestion would be to ask a professional hair stylist. She'd be able to whip u up into shape in no time!|`|9enPzcNyaa	you should never dye your hair yourself! go to a hairdresser and they can do it the right way! and make sure you keep up on it,have them discuss ways to help you improve and keep your color longest. remember,store bought BAD,salon done GOOD!!!|`|AA12111688	Explain to your hair dresser that you don't want to be shocked all at once by the amount of gray that you have.    She (or he) can give you a "weave" that eliminates the dyed color from your hair in just a few areas and then the next time you go, the weave would expose a littlle more.........and so on, until your hair is 100% natural.    I've had friends do this and I plan to do this as well.  Just tell your hairdresser "Please go easy on me, I don't want to leave here in tears!"  They should understand what you're trying to accomplish.    Good Luck!

Have an appraisal in hand as bidders will be more comfortable spending more money if they can see a professional estimate of what the diamond ring is worth.  Be sure to check and see what the fees for selling your diamond ring will be as this will cut into your bottom line.    Before you listed on eBay check with all your friends to be sure that nobody is going to need a nice diamond engagement ring anytime soon.  With individual sales there are no fees and as they get to inspect the ring before they buy you might get a higher price.    Another option might be to advertise it locally in one of the trade magazines, again no fees and the opportunity for the buyer to inspect the piece and view your appraisal might raise the price a bit and every penny counts!

4gD0KEShaa	Here is the deal: Don't wear something unexpected or that is weird and not normal and can sometimes make your date uncomfortable     So wear whatever tops you like to wear and some nice jeans or pants, even a skirt if it isn't to over the top, go to like aeropostale, american eagle, and maybe even pacsun and you can find some good tops and jeans or skirts to wear.    For accessories don't wear to much fancy and expensive stuff unless there is like a necklace that you treasure, your don't really have to wear too many accessories just things that make you, you    For your hair either wear it down straight, in a simple ponytail, or in a loose braid, What I do is start with it down and bring a hair thing with me and put my hair up later.      Makeup: Go really light only a little concealer where needed, a tiny amount of blush (maybelline expert wear blush in natural rose) and a little light lip gloss (usually clear is just fine like maybelline shiny-licous in berry-clear)    And by the way- don't wear a plumper because IF you do any kissing it rubs off on him and usually hurts him    Hope this helped and if you need any more help feel free to email me|`|3mQPQen5aa	I'd wear ballet flats & jeans.

de07aad9953ab47e0927c3931b142a4baa	When getting a haircut, having a good idea of what you want is very important. But knowing just what you want (and being able to explain how you want it done) is a predicament for anyone. When getting your haircut I personally think that it should be a haircut that is popular at the present time, describes you, and it must be easy to maintain.     Not everyone has the same hair type; one type of cut can make a man look stylish, while on others it may do just the opposite. It is important to know if your hair is normal, dry, oily, or a combination so that you can caterer your hairstyle to that type and therefore make it easier to handle and deal with. Also knowing what type of environment you are dealing with is helpful. If the hairstyle you are going for requires constant gelling and you are going to be at school all day, you may run into some problems.      Your body type is also a factor in deciding what cut is best for you. If youre slim and straight, the goal is to add some body and curves where you can. Medium length, wavier, or chunkier hairstyles look best and add flair to this body type. Long bangs, layers, and angles also flatter. Dont go too big-haired or your hair will look disproportionate to your body. Also avoid too long, too straight and sleek hair as it emphasizes your thinness. If you have a curvy and full body type, go for a layered, medium-length cut. An angled look will camouflage extra pudge on your face and neck. Try side parts and bangs for a soft, complementary look to your curves. Stay away from hair that is too short and close to the head or, in the opposite spectrum, long and very full. Round-shaped styles, like a curly ones with lots of height and width, are also not for you. If youre Petite, keep hair loose, smooth, and neat for a professional, sleek appearance. Try medium to short length hair with layers, angles, and some height at the top of the head. Don't go to extremes. Too-short hair will make your head look too small, and too-long hair will overpower your figure. Last but defiantly not least, if you are tall and athletic, just experiment with hairstyles to see what flatters your hair texture and face shape. This body type works best with most hairstyles...    If you choose to wear your hair really short, try to make it short all over, not short on the bottom with the rest of your hair long on top like some attempt. For short hair, here are three things you can do: Try pushing your bangs forward as actor George Clooney has been seen doing (seeing what is popular on the celebrities is helpful in choosing a cut.), gel your bangs upward (not at a 90 degree angle!) and back in more of a diagonal by using gel or paste, and/or make your hair look "spikey" by using hair gel or similar products.    Another tip is to have a picture of what you want or of a haircut that is similar to your idea. This way the stylist will be able to give the cut better.     As for the links below: The first one is a website that provides galleries of different types of haircuts as well as tips and advice. The second one is a pretty neat virtual haircuts that you can just mess around with and maybe get an idea of what a certain haircut style you are thinking of might look like on you.     I hope this helps. I apologize for its length ^_^; Hope the haircut looks great on you! It probably will though ;)
c00d255dd562b62945abfca49d5c9253aa	It doesn't stop it from growing faster.  I personally wash my hair everyday, always have.  But,I have hair that tends to get oily.  If you do not have a problem with an oily scalp, and you feel comfortable waiting a day in between, then that is fine. The key is always using a good conditioner, and something to protect your hair from heat and styling damage.  I use Crema conditioner by Terax ($22), this is the best conditioner you will ever use on your hair. It makes it silky, shiny, and manageable.  I also use a protective serum on my hair before drying and straightening called Illuminating Serum Crystalli Liquid by AlfaParf ($28). This stuff is incredible, it makes your hair really shiny, it smoothes, and protects.  Also, use a shampoo that is really gentle on your hair, I use Delicato shampoo by Terax ($15), it is made for people who wash their hair everyday, and is an extremely mild formula.  Hope this helps you.|`|349725e59f79fa41fd0c8a84aa2ce76daa	well i wash it everyday and its not like damaged or anything|`|AA10879921	i dunno but i know that if ur hair is really clean you could get lice|`|EWdiNqLdaa	depends on what kind of hair you have. if you have poofy curly hair than wash it every other day, wavy and straight can be washed every day. if you want it to gro fast braidng and brushing your hair hard will help, pulling on it alot, but don't pull it out, will help too.
9AYBm0UGaa	You can gauge your ears, like how a lot of punkish people have their ear hole expanded. 20gauge is the smallest and they go backwards, so 14 would be kinda big.|`|xyqs21tAaa	regular earring holes are smaller than a 14g hole.. the smaller the gauge number the bigger the size

AA10473274	I use to get them when I was a teenager, you have to let them clear up on their own. The ones I hate the most is the ones you get in your ears...painful|`|KfM8ApsKaa	You can get one just about anywhere you have a "pore" in your skin..so that's everywhere. Eyes (a sty) ears.. nose.. Lip line.. I hate those.. I would imagine those are sore for you to mess with , so I'd maybe put a little hydrogen peroxide on a Qtip and dab it. That will help with the infected pore. Good Luck|`|MsJXVrkpaa	i think it's because our nose is part of the T-zone where in it is the first thing to become oily. And since we are all active, our sebaceous gland produce more oil, and together with heat, dirt in air and stress, it now leads to the thing we all hated, "zits". And the best thing to avoid and treat them is first, make sure your hands are always clean, touch your face less, and wash your hands more. Apply some benzoyl peroxide or a salicylic acid both in a lower concentration like 2% upto 5%. and avoid creams that are comedogenic or can clog pores. thats it, don't prick it, be patient in dealing? healing/treating those zits. 'till next time. cheer-up|`|7tPiRXxzaa	yes, you can get zits on your nose (ever heard of the famous "rudolf nose before a date or pics"? LOL) your forhead and nose are your t-zone area (usually where you get most of your zit/pimples).  to get rid of the zits i use a face wash called biore, pore unclogging scrub.     i use it every night and have almost no zits.  i love their products!  the unclogging scrub has little blue beads in the to scrub away dirt, oils, and dead skin cells. but dont worry, its not too harsh on your face.  you might wanna check out the biore website.  hope that helps!
AA11572792	well, i didn't really know with my converses, so i just made up a way.  you start by stringing them IN (toward the shoe) the first two holes, so it is even on both sides.  Then, you take one of the strings, and string it up and OUT the next hole up, then you bring it across the shoe, and it makes a bar.  You do the same thing at different intervals so eventually you have shoes that look like bars and are on the last hole of either side. that is what i did, it works, but it is kind of hard to explain.

fc84d67f2677b0a2416f933fe8b0b777aa	If it is the 1st time,  have it done by a reputable hair care professional.    preferably one that is very experienced with hair care for brown Americans/ethnic hair.  I don't think age matters, her body will always be going through changes, especially up through 21 years old.|`|7q55tk7laa	yea if shes under a lot of stress = ]|`|OrXCCxfyaa	Wait until shes older because she is still growing and peoples hair changes over time. I wouldn;t reccomend a relaxer. Try different hair products like detangelers and frizz control.|`|taaQtwMsaa	I didn't get my first relaxer until I was 18.  I got picked on all the time in middle school for not having one.  The only reason I got one was for something different.    I don't have one stylist in particular, but if her hair is like mine (doesn't keep much of a style for more than five minutes, breaks combs from a foot away, draws up and feels like a sheep's bum after it gets wet), the stylists I've talked to have always told me to process the crap out of my hair.  It's too thick, we're going to charge you 10 dollars more.  We don't like to work with hair like that.  Whine whine whine.     If anyone tells you that she absolutely NEEDS chemicals in her hair, don't listen to them.  We've managed for how long without harsh chemicals?      It's between what you and your daughter want.  If you don't want a full-relaxer, but just something to loosen it up and make it a bit more manageable, go for a texturizer.  I've been thinking of one myself.    Also, are you willing to help her with the upkeep of it so her hair doesn't break off?|`|xWr5iHBgaa	i really dont know but i would wait a few years to do it at least tile she is a younger teen around 15 or so... she will probly handle it better|`|i50CczIuaa	No, when her hair falls out you'll regret it. ask other african-american teens who got their hair permed at an early age. you should hot comb it for special occasions, and just keep it braided the rest of the time. then when she is old enough to get a perm then you should let her make that decision. hope i helped.|`|yXohG1hVaa	I put a relaxer in my daughter's extremely curly thick hair at the same age, and have regretted it ever since. It's okay doing it the first time, but when it comes time to touch up the regrowth the real fun begins. If you overlap where you have already relaxed, it fries the hair majorly.  I wish I had left my daughter's curls alone, we have spent nearly two years trying to slowly trim off the damage and let her natural curl come back.
UA3c42reaa	Water pistol. Wal*Mart. 87 cents.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	North American Arms makes a couple of very small .22 caliber pistols.  While they are tiny and easy to conceal they are not good for much.  they are so small that they are difficult to shoot and they are underpowered for the proper roll of the .22.    A listing and prices of the North Americans Arms mini pistols can be found here:    http://www.impactguns.com/store/naa.html    If you looking for something for defensive purposes, I would avoid these pistols.

I think you're right, clip in coon tail striped hair extensions are best because-    - you don't ruin your hair with dye  - they don't grow out  - you can put them in and take them off  - they can last you forever  - they're cheap  - they look like the real thing  - they wont go all frizzy and weird like real hair does when it's dyed, it'll just look like part of your hair.  - You can change your look really easily

My suggestion would be to try Mary Kay's medium coverage liquid foundation....it's very sheer, contains a transfer resistent ingredient so it won't rug off once it dries and there are a lot of shades to choose from so you can find one that matches exactly.

First: Purchase a mild Shampoo (To Clarify hair, I will explain why)    Second: TRIM your hair ends (May 1 1/2 to 2 inches)     Third: Here's the magic part: Mix olive oil, almond oil, coconut oil, avocado oil and a "little" honey, (honey u will have to heat so it can blend). Either leave on ALL day or all night (if all nite, DONT use honey)     Use a teaspoon of every oil and honey,.... a little more if ur hair is long or a little less if ur hair is short    Repeat this 3-4 times a week, your hair will grow like a weed, fortify, reconstruct, moisturize, soften & remove all frizz I promise,..... and it will be super shiny!!!!       The clairifying shampoo will help take the oil off your hair when u shower    You can also use a conditioner but get a light conditioner that wont wiegh ur hair down, becuz u can over condition, I use herbl essences "clean happy" conditioner.    When I do this at nite, I wake up, shampoo & condition, rinse and style as usual.

Since you can't wash your hair a lot, find a good but light leave-in conditioner and do it before bed. Also sleeping in a loose braid causes way less damage than ponytails. Be good to the ends and get regular trims so you won't have nasty split ends that may cause you to lose lots of length from breakage. I have long wavy hair that grows very quickly. I eat a very healthy, mostly vegetarian (no red meat or pork) diet. I especially eat a lot of soy protein. Also you should find a good multivitamin (if it's ok with your parents) that is made just for women and has lots of vitamin e. Fish oil is great too. Basically there isn't much else you can do. Don't buy anything that says it will make your hair grow faster, either the ingredients are just vitamins or they're weird chemicals you shouldn't be putting into your growing body. Hope this helps.|`|YlXUNLANaa	eat good, drink milk and drinkcoconut water than your hair will be silky and strong

( saline is a salt water, this is safer because it you were to damage one and it leaked, the saline would absorb into your body just as water would and its 100% safe. if silicone were to leak or bust it could cause you to get VERY VERY sick.)    i was a 32a and I got 210cc filled to 240cc which I now wear a 34b and sometimes a 32-34c.    I would go with a smaller size even though your surgeon will tell you that you should go bigger. I think a BA should be about looking natural and good and not to wear everybody that passes by you can tell your boobs are fake. you should want your new boobs to match your body and not OVER power your body. that is the reason I went smaller. I really like the extra volume I have and I dont even look like I have 'fake' boobs. 100% natural looking and so natural no body would even know they weren't real.|`|Sngc7UxUaa	Breast implant surgery is very safe nowadays. My cousin got her breast reduction, tummy tuck and facelift surgery in India by the company called Tour2india4health Consultants .The Price for the surgery she paid in India was very less. She paid 30% of the cost she was quoted in America.    Tour2india4health Consultants is very famous in India. They arrange cosmetic and plastic surgery for foreigners in India. I read a lot about them in the Newspapers and about their patient stories. They arrange financing for USA, Canadian, UK and other international patients who plan to have surgery abroad for low price, as the breast reduction, tummy tuck, facelift and other cosmetic surgery is not covered by insurance. They also have photos pasted of their International patients. You can checkout their website. There are huge cost savings. As a doctor I personally believe that surgery can be easily handled in India, as the quality of healthcare available In India is simply best in the world. The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star.    http://www.tour2india4health.com  Hope this helps.

I went to American Apparel and bought sparkly leggings, and a huge neon paint splattered tee. I tied the tee to one side with a hair elastic. For makeup, I did heavy blue eyeshadow and hot pink lip gloss, and I crimped my hair and tied it to the side. Then I just wore bulky sneakers and an athletic headband and wristbands. You have to be pretty thin to pull the look off, though, because the sparkly leggings are pretty out there. Also, try a oversized blank tee, and write TIGER or something like that in neon paint.

lPCjNkEnaa	ONE INGREDIENT RECIPES: <br>  <br>  Tomato Juice Mask<br>  Plain tomato juice can be applied for about 15-20 minutes.<br>  Egg White Facial<br>  Simply separate a few raw egg whites into a bowl and apply directly on the facial skin after cleansing. Let the egg white dry for 10-20 minutes and rinse it off with lukewarm water for an instant glow. <br>  Egg Yolk Mask<br>  Simply stir up 1 egg yolk very well. Apply all over face for 15 minutes. Rinse with warm water.<br>  Honey Mask<br>  Massage a small amount of slightly heated honey onto skin and leave on for 10-15 minutes. Be sure to wash off all the honey with lukewarm water or the honey left will clog your pores, resulting in more acne. Wheat germ may be added for its abrasive action, protein and nutrients.<br>  Banana Mask<br>  Peel the skin off and mash the whole banana. Apply on all over your face and relax for 30 minutes. Then rinse using warm water.<br>  Carrot Mask <br>  Cook two carrots until able to be mashed with a fork. Spread evenly over face and allow to dry. Rinse with tepid water. <br>  Cucumber Mask <br>  A small amount of mashed cucumber applied over the face will hydrate and refresh. Leave on face up to twenty minutes and rinse. Place a couple slices over the eyes for soothing eye treatment at the same time!<br>  Oatmeal Scrub<br>  Oatmeal when mashed not only acts as a great scrub but also effectively soaks away the excess oil from your face. The usage of oatmeal paste must be followed by a cold water rinse that helps in contracting the pores.<br>  Baking Soda Scrub<br>  You can use baking soda as an exfoliator: be careful when applying it to your face, since it is a very effective scrub. Massage the baking soda into your skin for ten to fifteen seconds and rinse. <br>  Seawater Wash<br>  Wash your face twice a day in warm, salty water.<br>  Neosporin<br>  Use Neosporin on stubborn whiteheads, pimples, and/or scars overnight to help clear and heal skin. <br>  <br>  Makeup:<br>  Physician's Formula<br>  <a href="http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/default.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/d...</a>|`|GBOgsAoDaa	do not use a clenser every night it will make your skin all flakey!!!!
d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	Massaging with essential oils works wonders. Can quickly reduce pores, get rid of all blackheads and most blemishes. Certain oils are beneficial in treating acne prone and sensitive skins and lessen skin's production of oil. Olive, almond, and cypress are excellent. To get fastest results do it quite vigorously. You will see them diminish in just one day. Oils feed and nourish skin with many beneficial health enhancing nutrients and will give you a revitalized healthy and glowing skin. <br>  It's best to massage with a forward and back motion. Circular massage is less effective.<br>  <br>  SOURCE(S): 20 + years research, experimentation - safe natural treatments/cures for skin conditions and skin enhancement..|`|abbeQNPwaa	HEB's are only in Texas!

UiSLahaqaa	the natural way. Amla (Indian Gooseberry) was used by women in ancient times to take care of their mane. It could help you too. Ayurvedic texts are replete with references about the usefulness of amla as a hair tonic. Premature graying, hair-loss, dull, limp and oily hair – you name it and ‘amla’ seems to have a solution to your problem. <br>  1. Apply a mixture of almond oil and gooseberry juice with finger tips on the scalp. <br>  2. Boil one cup of dried gooseberry with 4 cups of water. Add a pinch of sugar in it. Keep boiling till the quantity of the liquid reduces to one cup. Mix 2 cups of Mehendi, an egg, juice of a lemon and the gooseberry solution and apply on hair. Wash the hair after two hours. <br>  3.Amla to prevent premature graying<br>  Take a few amla and cut them into pieces. Dry them in shade. Boil these pieces in coconut oil till the solid matter becomes like charred dust. This darkish oil is an excellent oil to prevent graying of hair. Massaging the scalp with amla oil induces sound sleep also. <br>  4.Amla as a conditioner<br>  The water in which dried amla pieces are soaked overnight nourishes the hair and this water can be used as a last rinse while washing your hair<br>  5.Amla to prevent hair-loss<br>  If you are losing hair excessively on your scalp, a regular intake of amla not only prevents further hair depletion but is also good for hair growth. Also wash you hair with the fresh juice of amla. <br>  <br>  Medicinal benefits and home remedies with Amla (Gooseberry):<br>  * A tablespoon each of fresh gooseberry juice and honey mixed together forms a very effective medicine for several ailments. Its regular use will promote vigor in the body within a few days. When fresh fruit is not available, dry powder can be mixed with honey.<br>  <br>  * A tablespoon of gooseberry juice, mixed with a cup of fresh bitter gourd juice, taken daily for 2 months will reduce the blood sugar in diabetes. Diet restrictions should be strictly observed while taking this medicine.<br>  <br>  * An equal quantity of amla powder, jamun powder and bitter gourd also makes a very useful remedy for diabetics. A tablespoonful of this mixture once or twice a day would be effective in checking the progress of the disease.<br>  * It is considered an effective remedy for heart disease. It tones up the functions of all the organs of the body and builds up health by destroying the heterogeneous elements and renewing the body energy.<br>  <br>  * The juice of Indian gooseberry, mixed with honey is useful in preserving eye sight. It also helps in the treatment of conjunctivitis and glaucoma. It reduces intraocular tension. A cupful of this juice should be taken mixed with honey twice daily in such cases.<br>  <br>  * The Indian gooseberry is useful in the treatment of rheumatism. One teaspoonful of powder of dry fruit mixed with two teaspoonfuls of jaggery should be taken twice daily for a month in this disease.<br>  <br>  * The dried fruit is good for diarrhea and dysentery. A drink made from amla mixed with lemon juice and misri is considered beneficial in controlling acute bacillary dysentery.<br>  <br>  * Gooseberry has revitalizing effects. It is effective in maintaining strength in old age. It improves body resistance and protects against infection. It strengthens heart, hair and different glands in the body.<br>  <br>  * A confection prepared from the preserved fruit is useful in chronic constipation and acts as an enhancer of immunity.<br>  <br>  * A decoction of the leaves and bark is useful in mouth and tongue ulcers as a gargle.<br>  <br>  * An oil obtained from the berries, strengthens hair and promotes hair growth.<br>  <br>  i hope it will help you to understan amla well|`|Teuq0s9aaa	yes, if u eat it its good for the hair|`|4kmUX5pHaa	Yes it is a good hair treatment and cleaning agent and also help in keeping our hairs black.

qVEGwLbwaa	It really depends on what you want to look like but I suggest using eyeshadow colors that make your eyes pop like blue, green, or light purple. If you do use blue or green eyeshadow, don't over do it, or else you won't look as good as you could. You probably can keep your eyeliner the same or you can use a dark plum or navy eyeliner. If my suggestions don't work, simply try using some eyeshadow colors that are different, but look good with your outfit.|`|Sv0SV0E1aa	With your skin tone, matte purple eyeshadow and metallic pink and dark blues would look great. Put it all over the lids and the crease, a thin layer of eyeliner on top and bottom lashes, and two coats of mascara. Remember to curl your lashes first.<br>  Good luck!!|`|NtTUzBaHaa	When your putting on your mascara;<br>  spin the brush and pull up, it makes them longer and much preitter.<br>  Try some light gold with some black eyeliner also and some peach lip gloss would look really pretty.|`|UHjXC1Jhaa	I have the same complextion and hair/eye color. When used the right way purple shades of eyeshadow look great on brown eyes!!! and just a nude gloss since the purple makes your eyes kinda dramatic.|`|GBOgsAoDaa	use sliver or purple both of those would look really great with your eyes:)<br>  <br>  hope i helped:)

FlkdiLRWaa	Hola amiga Glinda, tengo entendido q los producots de nivea visage son de excelente calidad, pero como ya sabes, cada una de nosotras es distinta y nuestra piel responde distinto a los producots q recibe... yo te recomiendo q intentes con una lnea hipoalergnica y libre de fragancia, ya q son menos agresivas con la piel, muchas veces nuestar piel se siente agredida y reponde produciendo mas grasa de la q ya tenemos!!!!!!! Y por su puesto, utiliza maquillaje especialmente dise?ado para piel grasa, si es en polvo, mejor.... te recomiendo Almay y clinique... suerte amiga!!!    Ginda no soy mexicana soy de venezuela, pero por referencia de algunas chicas aqui en YR se q Almay se vende en Mxico, Almay es hipoalergnico, libre de fragancia, y no es agresivo, es la marca q uso en cuidado del rostro y maquillaje... Clinique tiene un sistema de 3 pasos excelente para pieles grasas, solo q algo mas costosos... pero su cacracterstica principal es la suavidad con la q trata tu piel al mismo tiempo q elimina el exceso de oleosidad...  No son difciles de encontrar, en las grandes tiendas departamentales y en las grandes tiendas de farmacias los consigues... me gustara ayudarte un poco mas, dejame ver q puedo investigar.....|`|rbx8uzXRaa	lavate la cara con agua tibia en las ma?anas  echate sabila a la piel pero antes deberas quitarle el yodo en agua ...  lavate con limon...  no uses toallas al secarte el rostro  menos jabones  pero si...para la piel grasosa es bueno el agua tibia ...|`|zBG1x0sHaa	comprate la pons b3.Es buenisima....y junto con ella el sanalo es bueno--- sanalo en la noche y la pons b3 en la tarde|`|I4MJqyJyaa	mira  yo te recomiendo una hieva muy buena se llama lentejilla y la encuentras en cuanquier lugar donde vendan hiervas, mira la plantita la hierves ya q se ponga de un color amarillento, vacias un poco en un recipiente pro q este caliente y con un algodon o trapo te la untas en la cara y te quitara lo grasoso de tu carita.    aparte de q si tienes barritos y espinillas te las seca pro ten pasciencia y veras resultados a los 3 dias maximo de usarla y si la usas espero tu opinion. mi correo es armoni_1385@yahoo.com.mx o rafajer_169_1906@hotmail.com   yo la uso y me sirve espero te sirva a ti, bye

They may also include times of upcoming open calls.<br>  <br>  If there is no open call information, you might want to call and see if they have any upcoming open calls. But for the other details, they will almost always tell you to look at their website. That's what we were instructed to do if anyone called about becoming a model - we just had to give them the website address and tell them all the information they need is on the site|`|Nk6NS5Lxaa	look at the website <a href="http://www.thefashionfix" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefashionfix</a> in particular the pages <a href="http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/what-happens-when-you-go-to-visit-model.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/wha...</a><br>  <br>  good luck

hw8gC7bhaa	Tell her you need your hair Razored and Layered.<br>  Short layers, or long layers is completely up to you.<br>  and maybe you outta get your hair thinned out too !|`|os1ydh2daa	not a big fan of the style. maybe you should keep looking.|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	if i were you, i would print out a picture of her with her hair the way u want it, then she will be able to do it. if u can't do that then say "i want side sweep bangs to the left. and i want i thinned and shoulder length." that's how hers is.|`|yHWkQs9Paa	Print a picture of her hair or hair like hers, and give it to your hairdresser. Much easier than trying to describe it.
stGj5jgvaa	Layer 2 long sleeve shirts kind of tight yet stretchy so you can move<br>  blush, foundation, subtle sparkles for eyeshadow and light pink lipgloss, no accessories<br>  hair in a loose ponytail (high) <br>  OR<br>  2 tank-tops (a color that looks good on you and that stands out like turquiose or bright pink)<br>  same hair and makeup as above<br>  <br>  Have funnn!!!!|`|7Sa4fkUlaa	Do not wear sofee shorts you will be very uncomfortable playing in short shorts. Make sure your hair is pulled back neatly and you do not wear make-up! (You will sweat it off thus looking like a monster at the end of practice.) Wear what you normally do play your hardest and completley ignore him during practice. Then talk to him afterward. This way he will take you more seriously as an athlete and not a ditsy girl! This is how I got my boyfriend we both play basketball!|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	try putting a lacy tank under a plain one. wear your hair in a loose pony and put on mascara, foundation, a little blush, and a light eyeshadow. put the eye shadow on all the way up to your brow bone. finish it all off with a pink tinted lip gloss|`|Lp4JfVTRaa	it's just basketball, wear what you normally wear and make sure you play well--he should be impressed with your skills|`|SqI4CEtnaa	well, if you are supposed to wear a practice jersy or a certain color, then you'd better wear that<br>  you dont want to get yelled at by your coach in front of your crush|`|prllht3vaa	Well its practice.. you dont need to look wonderful... But if i were you id wear 2 tank tops, whatever color. Maybe a curly ponytail, just some cover up for any spots. Just look yourself, dont be someone your not.|`|8b364392d0522c3c2402469363363901aa	well since youre going to practice... no accessories.<br>  i would wear a pair of soffe shorts instead of long ones, much cuter.<br>  any kind of t shirt that isnt too loose and isnt crew cut.|`|1JywgkyMaa	wear your hair in a pony tail|`|IP0fj9Wgaa	worry more about not embarassing yourself on the court than what you look like:)  think about it...<br>  would you rather date an extremely hot guy who sucks at sports<br>  or a cute guy who is really athletic?<br>  yeah well just think about that:) <br>  have fun at bball|`|vNBYAIZLaa	honestly its basketball- wear what you would normally wear and if he isn't impressed that's his problem|`|fHIIhCAXaa	just wear your normal stuff because then you seem athletic and good at it. You dont want him to know that you are dressing up for him. also maybe wear makeup and put your hair in a messy bun. just be normal.|`|YuPNVX9maa	To compensate for the shorts, which don't sound that great, focus on your upper body. Try a tighter fitting t shirt with a cute print or interesting design, which will detract from the shorts. You want to look laid back, because it's  bball practice, so you can't dress up, so wear a couple everyday bracelets. Go for light makeup. A little bit of eyeliner, some mascara, and a brushing of bronzer if you need it. Use cover up if you need it, but don't use foundation or eyeshadow, as the foundation will clog your pores while you exercise and eyeshadow will come off pretty quickly if you start sweating. Make sure your hair is clean and shiny, and put it in a ponytail with a bright elastic or ribbon. Also, don't forget deodorant!!!!!!|`|MFKgVsoAaa	it depends on if you have to dress a certain way or not. if you have to wear a jersey or a certain t-shirt, wear that (don't want to upset the coach...). if you have to wear a certain color, lets say blue for example, then wear a blue tank top or fitted t-shirt that's not too tight and not too loose, with some sneakers, and have your hair pulled back in a straight, tight high ponytail. you can wear one of those basketball bands on your wrist if you want, but honestly it's just don't over think it. i'm sure that you'll look good either way, and guys like girls that are just fun and have good energy, so your actions are more important than what you wear. for makeup, minimize it- just some chapstick or lipgloss (don't wear a lot of eye makeup- you don't want it to smear if you sweat), but make sure you have some perfume and deordorant available. hope i helped, have fun!|`|X8IHT587aa	peachy lipgloss or nude lipgloss.hair,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcksuiB9DXE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcksuiB9D...</a> ,eyes,<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CscN3pYzPfk&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CscN3pYzP...</a> and maybe some brown eyeliner just on the outer corners below the bottom lash line. maybe a cute necklace and a few bracelets.shirt.idk what u have. cute solid tanktop with a nice t-shirt.maybe white underneath,blue on top.or pink underneath and yellow on top.idk.whatever color combo u like.<br>  <br>  hope i helped :) just be urself tho!|`|Pl7J5HFMaa	wear whatever you are most comfortable in. you don't want to dress a certian way for him because thats not you. then ...
YuW4DWv2aa	the braiding is a good idea... make sure your hair is slightly wet, not soaking wet when you braid your hair at night. also, put in some moose or curling gel before you braid. <br>  <br>  OR... <br>  <br>  do paper bag curls and sleep in them. here is tutorial from youtube to show you how. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoZ2QGq0n4A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoZ2QGq0n...</a> <br>  <br>  hope this helps!!! good luck.:o)|`|3btLY1QCaa	after you take a shower you can put your hair in a loose bun or french braid it and sleep on it and when you wake up it will be wavy:)|`|zmXHte4Baa	braids. or you can use curling mousse, gel, etc. And you can use a curling iron, just use it on low heat and use a heat protector before so you dont damage your hair.|`|7N0hbw6Taa	braid your hair at night, and take it out in the morning and ta-da! your hairs wavy :)|`|liyjJvu8aa	u can braid it at nite and take it out in the mornin or use a curlin sheen or sumthin or spary
bg86ji6naa	make up and a nose job|`|Y0O6971laa	Okay, you're actually very pretty and easy to work with.  Curl your euelashes and wear black mascara and lipgloss and you'll be perfect.  Maybe some mineral powder, too.  It wont clog your pores.  Maybe get some bags because your forehead is a little big...|`|cr44LMyhaa	if you want to get rid of bags you can try using some concealer. Some other suggestions would be:<br>  <br>  try wearing a little blush <br>  <br>  maybe some light pink lipgloss<br>  <br>  and if you want you could try testing out some eyeshadow<br>  <br>  overall i think you are very pretty though, hope this helps.|`|XWhV3U29aa	I think you beatiful but here are some suggestions<br>  <br>  H@!R<br>  ~side bangs, with kind of a shoulder length choppy look<br>  ~DONT YOU DARE DYE YOUR HAIR, I LOOOOVE IT! lol<br>  <br>  M@K3UP~<br>  <br>  3Y3s<br>  ~shimmering natural colored eyeshadow(make your brown eyes POP)<br>  ~black mascara & eyeliner!<br>  <br>  L!PS<br>  ~either gloss or a glossy natural<br>  <br>  F0UND@T!0N<br>  ~dont need it GF lol!!!<br>  hope i helped|`|1B3ujUO4aa	pretty. 6.5/10...wait mebbe 7. to improve your looks add like some blush and like mebbe sprakly but natural looking eyeshadows to liven up ur face~! use voluminizing spray fro ur hair and mebbe curl it... wear mascra and a pretty tinted lipgloss.<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090224144330AAdd6HD&cp=2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|DKfScL8taa	First of all, you only need one pic. The four pictures is just ridiculous. I'd say some golden hue eyeshadow, make sure you put it in the corners of your eyes as well so it brightens them up, and a glossy pinkISH lipglos.<br>  As for the circles, I've had them all my life, I have found that less is more, and the powders are better. I have a special concealer brush and concealer that is by bare minerals (any brand should do) that makes my undereyes less noticeable. <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Escentuals-Minerals-Summer-Maximum-Concealer/dp/B000AP6JQ4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=miscellaneous&qid=1235605147&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Escentuals-Mineral...</a>|`|fhJxE8TQaa	You are absolutely beautiful in those pics...I wouldn't change a thing!! You look really natural and your skin is so clear. Also, I couldn't really tell that you have bags under your eyes. My only suggestion is to put some light, pinky peach eyeshadow on your top lid, it should bring out your eyes and make them pop a little more. Urban Decay has some really good ones (get them at Sephora). They're a bit pricey, but totally worth it because they last a long time. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!! :D
L3zxoUFVaa	prolly not a good idea based on infections|`|XcaGUlF4aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6kppDtADY&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wM6kppDtA...</a>|`|bsuOclQMaa	your tongue will be sore and swollen not your lips. you can still kiss.|`|24sK6L2uaa	You can't kiss not only because of the the swelling and it being sore but you can get an infection from it also.

r4i7xPnMaa	Blackground paint pot, and any SUPER purple eyeshadow you can find. Black liner, black mascara.|`|UHjXC1Jhaa	mac eyeshadow in contrast<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  urban decay in flash<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  if you can find any vibrant purple loose pigment shadow|`|XPDc0H6Haa	a loreal HIP eyeshadow duo. use a primer underneath it to really make the color pop!|`|inA6ZLeAaa	MAC I am sure that would work|`|GBOgsAoDaa	MAC would have the best makeup for this:)<br>  <br>  hope i helped:)
7FGsxx4Qaa	I hate tattoos and would never go out with anyone who had one..1 tattoo to me spells 'thug'..............|`|5BOV76bmaa	I Hate them on the face!<br>  Although sometimes those tear drops can look ok as they mean something as well.|`|HHyny0JSaa	Tattoos on the face are stupid. No wonder you are getting beat up.|`|SIE3HuHRaa	No one really likes tattoos on faces....unless you're trying to do us all a favor and hide ugliness or something, but hopefully that is not the case....its very unattractive...and a bit scary...and prolly hurt a lot....ick...a big NO!|`|rkFVxFb4aa	thug life on your face?

He was rubbing your legs and you two were just  relaxing on the couch, he might have thought you would be more comfortable with them off.  Or maybe he didn't want your shoes on his lap and was just being polite about it.|`|9cUNhsvsaa	Paranoid about what? :|<br>  <br>  <br>  I've never had a guy take my boots off, but I wouldn't be upset. Especially if we were dating for 8 monthes.

a7LvtYi0aa	vitamin e tablets work wonders. you can buy a bottle at Costco and they are little gell tablets you just break them and smear them on your forehead for a few weeks. Its better to use it in the night because the gel is kinda oily.|`|Ym1vJtXfaa	Aveda products  are good, but nothing beats forehead wrinkles like a syringe full of medical grade botulism right in the face.

I don't use it but I know it works for forehead wrinkles.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	I have really dry skin myself and I've been using Estee Lauders Day Wear Plus moisturizer for years. I'm 42 and have no wrinkles at all.<br>  If Estee is too expensive, Loreal has a great moisturizing line, always use sunscreen to prevent further wrinkles and at least 3 times a week do exfoliate that too helps.|`|dcd11iUwaa	keep your skin clean and well moisturized. i wouldn't worry about it now but if it bothers you in the future you might want to consider botox or surgical options.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	Stop being surprised/skeptical so much. It'll make you raise your eyebrow(s), which will wrinkle your forehead.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	try olay products or well try getting plastic surgery but be carefull|`|8FjdBxjZaa	See a doctor

k4MuKMfIaa	no pawn shops give ya nothing for em. Try e-bay if you can get good pictures of them. also try things like craigslist and your local newspaper.  Good luck. It may also be good to get it appraised or be able to provide receipts for what was paid for it.

Sometimes there is very little difference between parfum and eau de parfum except for some additional notes in either one of the two.|`|AA10462593	strength of the scent..perfune strongest, cologne next and then eau de toilet.|`|QIYqVke2aa	perfume mostly refers to ladies' scents.  Au de toilet - French for perfume/cologne, not sure which  cologne, typically, for men|`|Bz60lvJVaa	well cologne is for guys and is sligly made diff cuz its made for guys  the diffrence between eau de toliet is that its not as strong as purfume cuz its dosents us all the ingerdince perfume has
Ef5cjjpSaa	wash it in hot water (on its own)<br>   and then dry it on hot!<br>  Ohh yeah and make sure you check it often! you dont want to shrink it TOO much, haha :]<br>   and btw on the abercrombie site if you find the product on the website or possibly ebay, it tells u what fit it is, like slim or classic so you know if its supposed to be tight or lose in future lol.|`|FAEc5IHHaa	PUt it in the washing machine!<br>  <br>  i MEAN i HAD A xl THEN IT SHRINKED TO LIKE A M!!|`|C4HOi0qHaa	wash it in hot water and dry it

N7I1NT6Maa	That happened to me too, there's not really much you can do about it... That's just genes.  Same thing happened to my brother and to my dad.  I don't think there's anything you can do to turn it back to how it was short of some sort of styling procedure, for me combing bed head control freak straightening serum through my hair makes it a lot straighter and then I can flat iron it out if I feel like it.  Good luck.|`|HLqzrBNmaa	Permanently? Probably not.|`|boqwvEvUaa	um, not unless you straighten it...but i love curly hair on guys 8D|`|J3B5ehoxaa	Oh my god, the same thing happened to me...pissed me off so much!  My hair used to be perfectly pin-straight and now it's all wavy and weird so I had to buy a flat iron.  Unfortunately no...you can't get it to go back to the way it was unless you flat-iron it.  But don't do anything to it!

And if you want to learn from a celeb's style don't copy from, of all people, Ashley Tisdale. Try channeling Audrey Hepburn, Katherine O, Sienna Miller, or Kate Moss. They're all beautiful and supremely stylish. Oh and here is an extremely cute white dress I found, http://www.bcbg.com/product/index.jsp?pr...   ------- I have that dress in black, it's beautiful. And besides, that dress that Ashley's wearing is last season, I saw it at South Coast Plaza like two months ago. But try this dress too, it's cute http://www.bcbg.com/product/index.jsp?pr...   ------ That dress is cute too, also try Juicy Couture and ABS Alan Shwartz for cute and cheap dresses.

It will absorb moisture and help with odor.|`|AXFJUQcRaa	Well there is 2 ways that I'll do in this situation (1) use amens powder to absorb the smell or (2) I use something call FOOT WORKS deodorizing foot power, a friend got it from AVON for me.|`|vTKZOx2zaa	I get that too.  It doesn't matter what the shoes are made of and it only happens in some of them not all, weird!  I use Dr. Scholl's products.

qQqC2cHIaa	I live near Toronto and my best friend works on a store that sells uggs.  She says UGGS are the worst choice for snow boots, they are not waterproof or slush-proof, the road salt wrecks the outside of the boot turning it hard and dry, and the fleece isn't rated for the extreme cold we get in canada.  they are fine for fall and spring, but not for heavy canadian winters. No your feet will be very cold and wet if you wear uggs in the middle of winter.|`|UyLGEUgkaa	they wont keep your feet dry and they are too expensive to be getting wet and dirty like that.|`|fkNjoYAOaa	well that kind of stuff ruins uggs..   so i wouldnt use real uggs..  but sometimes you can find cheap fake ones that are thick and if you wear them with 2 pairs of socks they will keep your feet warm and dry..  but never use cute real expensive uggs!|`|hnItHP6yaa	I have knock off Uggs that I wear in snow.  I like them, until they get wet.  Then they do get kind of annoying.  lol.      Buuuuut...  one recommendation.    Spray them with some sort of suede wet protectant stuff.  It's saved mine! :)|`|ZHf8mIitaa	I think it's ridiculously stupid. No, they won't keep your feet dry.

Most people can tell, though, because my glasses have "BURBERRY" written on the side, my jeans have the back pattern of Rock and Republic, my hoodies say Juicy Couture" on the back, by trench coat and scarves have the Burberry pattern on them, etc etc.    The thing that bugs me most is when people ask me about my True Religion jacket, though. Because they CAN'T tell, and when they ask me I have to reply "Nordstrom", and they immediately think that I'm snobby or something.     You just have to live with it. It's who you are, right? So proudly flaunt it off. :D

yiKTiYBYaa	As a photographer, I say you can't. But there is ALWAYS the option of taking your glasses off during a photoshoot. You don't have to have perfect vision to pose for a camera. As long as you can see where the camera is located, or see where the photographer is asking you to look, or even where the end of the runway is at, I think you'll be just fine.    You can start modeling at any age, obviously. Otherwise we wouldn't have those adorable toddler clothes or baby diaper ads. ;)    As for height, it all depends on what kind of modeling you're looking to doing. Most agencies prefer someone taller than 5'7". But, again, it all depends on the type of modeling you're looking to do.

JtYNXoRdaa	Oh honey...it's heartbreaking that THIS is what 13 year olds are worrying about now.  Holy crap, what has our society done?    Black is always slimming, as are other darker colors.  Neon colors will make tans stand out...HOWEVER, if you're fair skinned naturally, neons will only serve to make you look paler.  I also agree with the poster who said tankinis can be quite good flattering, if you get the right kind, like a solid color.  And no ruffles on the bottom, it will draw attention.    But please, for the love of God, STOP worrying about this.  Believe me, when you're 18, 20, 24, you'll look back on pictures of your 13 year old self and wonder how in the WORLD you could have thought you needed slimming bikinis.  Believe me...I just looked through old pictures of me from 5 years ago and was disgusted that I spent so much time worrying back then.  I couldn't have been more than a size 2.|`|5c37fe67eb9da01203e3f28f39525434aa	well, if your already tan. i would suggest a neon color, in pink,white,yellow or green.    if your pale. try a softer blue,green, pink or yellow.|`|WYgqCSNkaa	is this stephanie nekoroski?|`|2I5XqMDzaa	ur to young to care|`|vR6AwIppaa	tell me if you find a good answer lolz  im 13 too and going on vacation in a month. i need to find a skinny-looking bikini for the beach!!!|`|Q5KFND17aa	bright neon bikinis always look hot (especially pink ones.) also if you want to look tanner i'd get some gradual tan lotion so that when it comes around to the time to wear it youd look tanner. thats what i do every summer and it always looks great.    and unless youre chubby stick to a bikini, not a tankini. tankinis make people look lame|`|fyKydb6Iaa	Your 13 !!

Avoid anything with horizontal stripes, to look thinner.  Don't get anything with ruffles on the bottoms either, they draw attention to your middle and legs.    Ruffles on your top however can draw attention up away from the areas you don't like.  :)    The girl above wrote that tankinis are lame, I disagree, as long as their in solid colors like this awesome looking model    http://www2.victoriassecret.com/commerce...|`|o43uZSDJaa	they say that dark colors make you appear slimmer, and i would presume neon colors would make you look more tan, like hot pink etc. hope this helps! =D

If you want a straight hair, use a straightener. But i think you must "blow dry it while combing it straight."    Ways for temporary straight hair:  1. get a dryer or blower and also comb.  2. Wet your hair.(you can do this after bath)  3. turn on the dryer.  4. While drying your hair useing a dryer, comb it straight.  5. Stop combing it when it is dry.    Enjoy your straight hair!|`|xZQjK7oKaa	Psh, don't think you're the only one. Be proud of your hair, it's the only one you've got. (Sure, you can pretend it's not your hair by straightening it, dying it, etc. but your hair is YOUR HAIR.)  Anyways, I use to have horribly frizzy hair. Now, my hair has accomplished it's soft curl look. All I did was give it patience, daily showers, and a little magic of what I like to call "Garnier" (hair product). Don't force you're hair, though. And let your hair dry, don't dry it out. That's so unnecessary.|`|EGRqOuOqaa	Hey i have poofy hair too.  but im a dude.

dyt2tkSmaa	Drinking a lot of water and taking vitamins helps. Also good sleep, low stress, being happy with friends, having a pet, lol, being happy and relaxed always help. Make sure to exfoliate once in a while, this takes away the dead skin cells. Don't do it too often if you think it will irritate your acne. Buy products for combination skin, because it sounds like that is what you have. Use a facial toner and light lotion. Try Almay. I like the grape seed kind for combination skin. Do you use makeup? I like clinique and almay. Also a little blush might help. Try saunas and exercise. Humidifiers. Tea, fruit, veggies, water. Certain vitamins help with skin, biotin, vitamin C, E, flax-seed. Boron, lutein, horsetail extract, etc. Remember to wash your face off at night or at least those makeup remover cloths. Also make sure to change the sheet covers on your pillows atleast once every two weeks, or better yet once a week.  You can also do homemade masks or buy them at the store. But remember to buy mild ones. Good luck  Remember you are beautiful no matter what.  Take care :)|`|OqnnJcJMaa	tea bags helps get rid of bags...so does hemorrhoid cream|`|JGOx9oa8aa	dont wear foundation it ruins your skin, use a toner and moisteriser morning and night and always clean your face|`|SkG2zZeYaa	nobody is perfect, just wash your face with oil free cleansers, cut down on fatty foods, and dont touch your face or skin after eating or without washing your hands first,|`|izYtGCwbaa	If you want flawless skin just wash it with that dove soup then add foundation then blush add a littel sparkle and flawless skin.|`|QFueVhHkaa	YES!   Drink PLENTY of water, this helps detox your skin and flush it out.

Another natural remedy is to put a hand-full of plain oats in the end of a stocking sock and tie it off, drench it in some water and you will have a milky oat face wash that leaves your skin clean and most importantly smooth,|`|FyFafCRLaa	Good looking parents combined with good genes always helps.|`|InzHK1rcaa	Dermatologist :] |`|EYzauk5Oaa	Your diet|`|BE0zSvlkaa	you sound crazy... :D    well i think partly flawless skin is based on genetics, like if your mom has it you have it too. and also just wash your face with soap everyday and never try to touch your face when you have dirty hands|`|CrT9sfEtaa	you really cant have "flawless" skin.    but if you find out, let me know.

0J6QibSAaa	Your hair looks just like mine- I have long hair past my waist; it's on the thin side, and while it isn't curly, it won't go straight unless I blow dry it that way- so it's sort of half wavy- but not in a good way.  Because I've been growing my hair out for years, and I've dyed it so much, my ends look perpetually fried.  I've tried about everything out there- from the 25 dollar stuff down.  In my experience, there are 2 ecellent conditioners: Pantene, and Dove.  I use Pantene religiously- it's worked for years- I don't buy the expensive restorative one either; just the regular line,  called daily moisture renewal.  it costs about 4 bucks, depending on what size you get.  Dove, on the other hand, is another good one.  I love dove prodcusts, so i wanted to try their hair care out; but I found only one of theirs to work well- it's in a dark blue bottle, called intensive repair.  It works just as well as pantene.  Now- here's the trick: Everyone has their own leave in creme, and I've used them all, but in most cases, it just weighs my hair down.  Sunsilk makes one called 24/7 "HYDRA" creme .  It's in a bright pink bottle, and costs about 3 bucks.  You can put it on dry hair, but here's the trick that has made my hair look awesome:  While you're in the shower, leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes.  Rinse it out with hot water (I know people say that's bad, but if you follow up with this creme, it works)- as hot as you can stand it' then brush it out to remove any leftover tangles (start at the ends at work your way up).  Once again, put your head under the hot water, then take the Sunsilk creme IMMIDIETLY after taking your head out of the water; and put it on like you would conditioner, but avoiding the roots.  If your hair is really long like mine, use a quarter size amount on each side, or if shorter, a dime size amount on each side.  Brush it through once more, then wrap your hair in a towel.  Do this while you still are in the shower, and finish whatever.  When you get out, and unwrap your hair, i promise it will be as soft as a baby's.    For some reason, the creme does nothing for me when I'm out of the shower- but when I apply it while I'm still in there, and then shave, I found the heat and steams traps all that moisture inside the towel, and your hair really absorbs the creme.    Lastly, you can also give Aussie products a shot- they wqork well, but tend to weigh my hair down after a few uses.  Cholesterol treatments are also a fairly cheap treatment- you can buy a tub of it for about five bucks, and you use it like an intensiv conitioner once a week and rinse out.  But I've been struggling with this hair for 31 years, and trust me, the sunsilk creme with sove or pantene conditioner will change your life.  (Okay, well, not really, but you will have rockin' hair).    |`|prOUXn6Zaa	i like the aussie 3 minute miracle or whatever, it's like $12    answer mine please.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...|`|aHtMxB1Daa	Loreal Paris Vive Pro the Hydra Gloss kind.

ab0vmSHZaa	Go for surgical steel grade jewellery. I have had a range of piercings over the years and have worn a variety of items in my piercings. Plastic jewellery scratches and the grooves that are created hold dirt and bacteria unless cleaned very well and regularly. If you are allergic the reaction will be quick so you will know but you would probably be ok with plastic. However plastic and many types of coloured metal cannot be steralised in an autoclave which is the best so you will need a good liquid cleanser. Go find a good body piercing shop and please remember- infections in percings are no fun|`|9PnxDHaWaa	Plastic ones helped mine get infected (I think because I got an allergy from it). But everyone's different. If you're unsure, try it out. Worst that can happen is they'll get infected, you'll have to take good care of them until they heal, then they will be back to normal. On the safe side you could just stick with metal....try to stay with stainless steel or sterling silver. None of that cheap crap....you'll get an allergy or infection for sure with that stuff!|`|pw7w8zzeaa	Never use plastic in freshly pierced or stretched holes. Metal for sure until they are completly healed
fQhGz3smaa	Personally I always prefer liquid foundation because it just gives a much more natural dewy look than powder, however powder does help set your make-up. If your skin doesn't need heavy coverage however you can always use a tinted moisturiser, for a more even skin tone without looking like your plastered in foundation haha.  It depends on what type of foundation you like in regards to what brand to use and that only comes from using different types. Maybelline does good cheaper options that offer good coverage and last a long time but still look natural, especially their everfresh foundation, also the dream matte mousse is very popular. However I use chanel  or lancome foundation as the texture just agrees with me and gives me a really natural finish, however if you're not sure I wouldn't choose such an expensive brand to start off.  And as for choosing the right colour, you are advised to test it on your cheekbone in natural but in truth you're not going to do that in a shop, so I would just try it on the back of my wrist and see if it covers my veins, and possibly just under my eyes or on my nose?    Hope that helps anyway :)|`|QGU7JAIUaa	I would use mac's prep + prime then mac's strobe liquid moisturiser and then use chanel's mat lumiere foundation finishing it off with some mac fix +. To find the shade suited best to your skintone, go to your local mac store and they'll pick out the best one. x|`|JaDnYs54aa	okay here are some basic foundation tips    before you put on foundation, ALWAYS use a primer. i recommend Smashbox Photo Finish primer but its pricey, i got one thats pretty good and not very pricy, its called Revlon Beyond Natural Primer. its rather good as well! Primer is important because it makes your face into a smooth canvas for your foundation, and it makes your foundation last a lot longer, TRUST ME. its a miracle product lol    for foundation, there are many good ones. i would suggest a liquid foundation because it looks and feels quite natural. i have a couple powder foundations but they really dont quite cut it. i wasted a lot of money lol. but i was learning.     LIQUID! do the liquidd. i use Revlon Custom Creations, you know that commercial with Jessica Alba? you pick your color shade (for me, i have light/medium) and it gives you the ability to turn the dial to find your PERFECT match. i like it a lot.    http://www.revlon.com/ProductCatalog/Pro...    i have found it to be very good =) in order to find the perfect match for your skin, either go to Dillards or a beauty shop and ask the experts there to pick which one matches you the best, or you can do what we call a color test. you go outside in the natural light with a mirror, and you apply 3 different colors on your face, you apply them in a line running down your cheek. whichever matches the best, thats the color for you.    and for face moisturizer, i like anything by bioelements.   http://www.beautybridge.com/bimox10.html    i love that stuff, its pricey though. honestly any moisterizer that isnt oil free should be okay (since you dont have oily skin you can add more moister by getting something thats not oil free)    make-up remover i use almay. very good stuff, and does the job. remember, make up remover and face cleanser are NOT the same thing. do not use remover in place of a cleanser. for cleanser it depends a lot on your skin type, go here and find out what products need to be in your cleanser and what not for your specific skin type...    http://www.skincareguide.ca/skincare_bas...    http://www.e-facial-skin-care.com/skin-c...|`|4f2071ce0b3deda8b527470042c9a809aa	Cover FX from Sephora's really good|`|2h913O0Saa	I think mousse foundation is the best! :)    Dream Matte Mousse is my favourite!|`|jKA8SovQaa	i'd suggest liquid it's easyier to apply  and usually powder wears off  ask an employee to help you match you're skin tone  take down the skin tone   and that's how you find out :P  i use foundation cause i can't apply powder (LMAO)  use a sponge when you apply it  i suggest MAC studio fix  or any any other MAC cosmetic products. because  their long lasting and don't smudge :O  at MAC and sephora they always have like booths  we're they do you're make up  and you can see which   foundation you like.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	One of the best foundation I have used is Revlon Colorstay (liquid; I prefer liquid as it blends better & is smoother). Altho' u might be too young for it & ur skin must be in pretty good condition so u might get away with a slightly lighter coverage one such as Bourjois brush foundation.    Also, I recently came across this new foundation called Mymix by Myface cosmetics in the Daily Mail which is supposed to be brilliant, & give you a lovely glow & make you radiant, please see my link for further & the article in the Daily Mail)  info:http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  .  You CAN & HAVE to stand in the shop applying foundation as there's no other way of finding the right colour for your face, Don't worry, noone will stare at you or think u r crazy as that is expected!  The way to find the exact colour for your face (& you do need to find the exact colour as any other colour will look fake) go bare faced (with no make-up on), & apply a line of the foundation on your jawline. If the colour disappears & blends into your skin colour & doesn't look different to the rest of your face then you have your colour! maybe ask one of the make-assistants to help you. They'd be more than happy to help as that's their job.    It is a good idea to wear moisturizer under your foundation as it makes it blend in well & not just "sit" on the top of ur skin. Apply about 5-10 mins before applying foundation.  The best moisturizer I have tried in the shops is Boots Traditional range Moisturizer with Vitamin A&E. It smells gorgeous, really makes ur skin soft & doesn't cause irritation. Honestly, I have recommneded it to loads of people & they all agreed. (also it is really good value for money, I think is about 2.35)  For face cleanser, the cold cream from the same range is pretty good (Boots Traditional cold cleanser).  Don't use toner, I read recently that most of them have alcohol in them which strips the skin of moisture & is not good for the kic. if you want to, use rose water.    ***TIP: If you want to look natural when applying foundation, don't plaster it all over your face, only apply to those areas of the face that you think needs covering, such as uneven skin tone, redness areas etc..this way u'll look natural & avoid the "cakey" look.    Hope this helps! & good luck foundation hunting!|`|hdO6CNQ1aa	Dream mousse foundation all the way!

Hope I helped :)|`|DrvEzGxIaa	Dude, the only thing you need to know about foundation is:  Shallow foundations        Main article: Shallow foundation    Shallow foundations are usually embedded a meter, a foot, or an inch or so into soil. One common type is the spread footing which consists of strips or pads of concrete (or other materials) which extend below the frost line and transfer the weight from walls and columns to the soil or bedrock. Another common type is the slab-on-grade in the south foundation where the weight of the building is transferred to the soil through a concrete slab placed at the surface.    [edit] Deep foundations        Main article: Deep foundation    Deep foundations are used to transfer a load from a structure through an upper weak layer of soil to a stronger deeper layer of soil. There are different types of deep foundations including helical piles, impact driven piles, drilled shafts, caissons, piers, and earth stabilized columns. The naming conventions for different types of foundations vary between different engineers. Historically, piles were wood, later steel, reinforced concrete, and pre-tensioned concrete. Sometimes these foundations penetrate.    [edit] Earthquake-protective foundations        Main article: Base isolation    Earthquake-protective foundation, also known as a freakin seismic or base isolation system, is a collection of structural elements which should substantially decouple a superstructure from its substructure resting on a shaking ground thus protecting a building or non-building structure's integrity (see, e.g., the concurrent shake-table crash testing video on Earthquake Protector). It is believed to be the most powerful tool of the earthquake engineering pertaining to the passive structural vibration control technologies.|`|A7ovwP94aa	Here are a few that claim to give a luminous look and have had good reviews.

Liquid gives you that celebrity glow but you may have to apply it often if you are physically doing something. Powder is what I use and I have to reapply it about half way through the day but that's because my skin is oily. Powder gives you more of a matte finish. My favorite foundation, in powder is Almost Powder Makeup SPF 15 from Clinique and my favorite foundation in liquid is Perfectly Real? Makeup by Clinique and it also comes in powder. At the Clinique Counters at Department Stores, they will help you pick the makeup that is perfect for your lifestyle and help you apply it so you can find the perfect shade and brush or applicator to apply it with.

And about chosing the correct colour. You just need to put a tiny bit on the back of your hand and blend it in. It may take a while but you will find the correct coluor sooner or later.    If you dont want to take a long time getting the colour right, just go up to the make up people in Boots and they will find the right colour for you!    I hope this helps|`|AA10552781	1. THE BODY SHOP compact powder foundation. (Dampen the sponge before aplly it on your face). For an every day use.    2. GUERLAIN compact powder foundation. (Witha dry sponge). For a nice evening look.    3. VICHY liquid foundation.    4. ROCHAS liquid foundation.    The most important thing to do before buying a foundation is to try it on your neck, if you can`t see it then this is the right shade for you. Don`t try it on your face, nor your wrist, only on your neck.    Hope that helped.    Good Luck.|`|JE3ak8JCaa	Dream Matte Mousse, by mabyline( or however you spell it:L)  its the best, ive only ever used it and it doesnt give you spots :)
9dtrWO5laa	I don't see girls doing that ..?|`|1PGmB4JNaa	shes just a weirdooooo jk i do that sometimes! haha idek why|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I guess so-if the other sleeve isn't bothering her then yeah she would leave that one down.|`|BkdZq0QPaa	there was a fashion by me about 2 years ago where people had one sleeve down n one up, havnt seen anyone do it for ages|`|0CHwkMz9aa	Um, you asked this before.    And like I said before...... She was probably cold.|`|bloGqdBqaa	oh my gosh, that is so so so annoying. i mean how do you cope with that yea, i would have said, "oh my gosh" or i would have said "you go girl"  that is so so so so embarrassing yea , i would have just shot myself yea and told her to talk to the hand|`|GuRluYmraa	i dont get what the problem is... so she had one sleeve up and down??  personally i wouldnt think anything of that and i wouldnt do that either. it would be none or both for me!|`|ygk6r2pCaa	i sometimes do this but only because i dont like to have both sleeves up at the same time coz it just annoys me.|`|aWMqEmWlaa	Your friend was hiding something... probably heiroin tracks or wrist slit scars / scabs.|`|lvalgliyaa	one sleeve up, one down? dont think iv ever seen this before or noticed at least |`|1aIlhd5Saa	Nothing is wrong with her. She is just like that, no big deal.|`|xCjdqp5paa	NEVER. SHE CAN PUT DOWN BOTH THE SLEEVE.|`|32ffqK7Haa	As far as I am aware there is no communal sleeve conspiracy among females.     There is most definitely a simple explanation for this:    > Her right arm was hot/itchy  > A secret sleeve code intended for other femaliens  > A parasitic beast on her right arm demanded oxygen  > The new fashion trend she forgot to observe earlier on    Observing folk is good, but some observations are probably better forgotten. Oh there I go again with one leg of my trousers pulled up. What does it mean!!!      
tVcaLj9Vaa	Sounds like a gorgeous combo! I suggest A beautiful copper color with maybe some blue in there, or a deep, shimmery plum shade. I think something matte would not look as good as something that shimmers on you. You could also go more natural with a tan shimmer and a rosy color.|`|v011fxgraa	how about a light gray or silver shade.|`|2BatkpPtaa	Bronze colors look really great on brunettes.   Deep purples are really great too.    http://www.eyeslipsface.com/eyes/duo_eye... - Mocha Swirl    http://www.maccosmetics.com/looks/look.t... - This is a makeup set especially for brunettes.

wGEdObyeaa	Okay, I would say for "Mall Madness" you're style is retro/mod/glam. For "School Girl" i'd say sporty/sweet. For the last one, "Comfy", it's a mixture of things.. probably athletic yet cool. My favorite is your Mall Madness style. :) I love how you made a collage with pictures of flowers and stuff along with your outfit choices. Very creative! Love your style.|`|AA11251992	yr style is plain but colorful|`|cZPWdr31aa	Your style is very fun and you stick to wear you are going ! =P    I think the outfits are pretty nice. =]       You have a lot of stuff !    My style is more modern.|`|DRjhRHRzaa	haha i love the last one.  I have the shoes & the phone. haha.  Your style seems really cute & pretty similar to mine!
LSwCiqBOaa	hell yes.  I've had black and red hair for years now and its always fun!  I suggest Fudge Paintbox red corvette. I swear by it lol  The first time you dye it it may fade after a few weeks but the more you dye it the longer it lasts. I purchase a bottle of fudge once every two months now for $15. And my hair looks great!  So much cheaper than a salon.  Red is a great colour for people with Olive skin tones and curls!   Have fun and enjoy it! |`|NOMqdP2jaa	do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it        it would be awesome if you did i would but i dont have the balls for it i would go for more than one color unless you like block colors |`|X0OHCMTZaa	yes cause if your tall skinny and white youll look like a match !|`|CsAcTJYzaa	hey, i was thinking the same thing ! i think it'll look great !|`|EnYLhQajaa	yeah! that woud look great!|`|1sfYOZNbaa	no! red is wayy to bright especially for you skin tone.|`|lNhUgQnuaa	Do it baby!!!  |`|ewiPc8NGaa	nooooo people with olive skin look good with black hair and brown hair!|`|LYO0Y8lHaa	It's really up to you. I think it would awesome in you had blue lowlights or red lowlights, I dont think you should dye your hair BRIGHT red but maybe a deep red? anyway it's your choice.|`|ijXOMlIsaa	absolutely go red! I've got a pixie cut, but straight hair and would love to go red only ive got black on it so it won't take.     short hair allows for more experimentation with colours than long hair does, funk it up! will look awesome with olive skin!! also maybe not so bright, go for a deep red. As long as you condition your hair with a treatment at least once every couple of weeks it shouldnt dry out and will stay healthy.|`|AA11829081	no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i would not! dont do it|`|B7DK6Sydaa	I don't agree with dying hair. There is so many people out there with great skin tone like yours that can pull it off. but it ruins your hair. And once you dye your hair once, you keep having to do it and it'll ruin your hair even more.|`|AA11708328	oh go for it if you want to|`|0oCMyq9Saa	No don't. It'd look great, but my friend does that. It fades within a few weeks coz the bleach is permanent, not the red dye. It looks horrible after about a week and it's all damaged and dry. Gross.

NOT SLIPPERS!! ha. i like more dress up shoes, but these would be good if you just DID not feel like getting ready...or in the winter when your feet are cold! they aren't horrible, although I would like them better without the HUGE lable on the side!|`|a23ed9a7251271b5fa90f198ad0372c8aa	Not really my style, but it looks comfortable. And COMFORT is important!
W50zzBQoaa	hhhmm.  well i suggest that you go to a hair Salon and get your hair thinned, layered and deep conditioned. that would be a good start. then i would start taking better care of your hair. instead of blow drying it. from now on take extra time to let it air dry and do your makeup while your waiting. start putting hair products in your hair while when it air drys or if you have to blow dry it before you blow dry it and put it in before you straighten it or use any other iron and then after you Straight your hair. a hair products i use are variety's of hair serum. hair serum is great cause you can use as much as you want and your hair wont look greasy i mean unless you use the whole thing. mostly put the serum at the ends and evenly through the top of your hair. more on the ends then tops of your head though.     the kind of serum i use is garnier fructis, and herbal essence serum. its reall cheap! and works great. i use to buy this serum from my hair Salon "ficocellos" but they no longer sell it so i used garnier fructis serum and it worked just as good! :]      they sell it at target    here is a  link to show you:    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    if you try to take good care of your hair and do what i told you then the hair prodcts and even straightening your hair will make it feel and look healthier. It will train your hair to do whatever you want it too     thats what mine did.|`|KdNbFB6Eaa	when u take a shower u need to condition it and leave it on for about 8 minuets then rinse it it might help if u get some specialty shampoo|`|f38784dc5f964420836559ea503219ccaa	try using a deep conditioner once a week your hair is probably over processed now and lay off the straightening for a while I know it's gonna suck but the less heat you use the better your hair will look in the long run.|`|t0bn2jcdaa	okay go to the salon and cut of at least an inch if it isnt to short already and deep condition it at least once a month but no to much cause that will damage it more if you do it to much.  Then whenever you wash your hair be sure to use plenty of conditionar and wash it out very well, after towel dry and put in leave in conditionar also oil mosturizors are really good to , try not to straiten it to much cause thats probably why your hair isnt getting any better  hope that helps you  trust me ive been there and it sucks but heat is provbably the main problem  so dont straigthen it!!!  also olive oil and mayo is supposed to be good  and try hot oils like vo5 hot oil tretment.  A good shampoo is soft sheen carson and the conditionar is great and so is there oil mosturizor. Its in wal mart in a neon yello bottle its bout 3 bucks it help cause it has all the oil hair needs to come back from being totaly fried  i really hope that helps|`|TZmzjFGzaa	Ok try getting your hair trimmed a bit. Then try the Aussie 3 minute miracle reconstructor. It helps alot!|`|BRIeyc8Raa	i have so been there.    start doing hair masks.     do a mayo mask every week and a hot oil one once a month.
HXFy2IMMaa	i really like cardigans plus that will give the outfit a little 50s flashback!|`|vlGHJgtMaa	A white dressy shirt....something maybe like this:  - http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|hnItHP6yaa	A nice button down shirt.    Either short sleeves with the poof sleeve.  Or quarter length.    White or black.      Same color heels as the blue with a black shirt.    Or a white shirt and black heels.    Ummm...  white flats and a white shirt.  black flats and the blue shirt.    A nice sweater shirt would look good too.  Like a sweater shirt in those colors.   One with a little turtle neck to it.    Hope I helped!     Cute skirt by the way.  :)
AiTTOsQHaa	I did kinda the same thing with my septum  Got it pierced and after it healed bought a 1.6 barbell instead of a 1.2 and so i had to stretch it    All i had to do was put vaseline on the barbell and around the hole of the piercing and pushed it a little and it went in quite easy and painless    I think you should put the corkscrew back in for a week or so, then try the ring    Good luck :]|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	Go see your piercer ^^    The way for you to sort it out yourself is to buy jewellery thats the right gauge to start with. I wouldn't try stretching it yourself, as its still fairly new, and you irritated it enough already. In a  month or so it will probably have loosened up enough for the corkscrew to go back in.  Use some lube, and don't force it.    You could try and put the corksrew in, but I doubt it would work by now.  If you go to the piercer, they might be able to stretch it up for you. Where at least everything is clean etc. And nosescrews are a pain to put in anyway.|`|UvOPy3dbaa	You could try to make the corkscrew fit. It will hurt because you're stretching the hole but after a day without any agitation, I think it would stop hurting. If its not that important to have to corkscrew one in then don't do it but if it is, well, then DO IT!|`|mYEhXpWQaa	yeah go get some ice and push it though :)  it wont hurt :)  alot anyway.|`|9e20cabaf1ecf0acafc3c11e5cd3f3d0aa	Im sorry but nose rings are gross. Maybe you should just leave it out. 
W840msNTaa	Don't let it get much longer than that. your hair length is good for that hairstyle. If it gets too long then it doesn't look good in my opinion.    maybe cut it in a month or two|`|5pt7vsTGaa	 a couple of months, then cut it! good luck!    how much can you tell about us by this photo?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...

ayq6E7EAaa	yes, i've been using it for a couple of months and it has worked for me. i saw improvements in the first days i used it and it just got better. but like any other system, you have to stick with the routine in order for it to work well.|`|mVEGrVuWaa	One word for this system: CRAP!|`|MiHgXLcwaa	I don't know about all that, but I can tell you what really works.  It is only if you're acne is severe, or if you have tried almost everything, and nothing works for a long period of time.  Ask your doctor about Accutane.  It gets rid of every acne situation and keeps it away.  Its a miracle worker, but the only thing is it is extremely powerful.  It makes everything dry.  And girls need a pregnancy test every month and blood test, but it works! And you won't have to mess with anything else ever again!|`|UFDPIDlzaa	no it only works on like 1 in ten girls and with those chances you better not waste your money.    i feel your pain though i searched for years and tried everything there was on the market. right now i have a cardboard box of old acne stuff taking up space in my room. its pathetic. i wasted so much money.    most acne product companies know that your desperate and lure you in with false hope, and then never come through. it sucks mucho.    your best bet is to go to your dermatologist and have them prescribe something. mine gave me these pills that (with my insurance) cost only ten dollars and clear up my acne. there amazing!    although try to get something safe you dont want to endanger yourself. the worst my medication will do is make me through up even if i take the whole bottle (and i know from experience that taking the whole bottle is NOT a good idea).  but my ex boyfriend was prescribed this stuff that apparently had made some teens deppressed and they then killed themselves as a result of the meds. he had to sign a waver. pretty freaky. i dont know about you but i would much rather risk embarrassment from acne than death. but maybe thats just me.      good luck i hope you find what youre looking for!|`|zTmY7jVKaa	The combination of Tea Tree Oil soap and the Clindamycin cream is the best for Acne and pimple.

9Eq9pozbaa	Curl ringlets all over your head (or at least the front half) the curling iron should be about 1 1/2 in. when your done pull your fingers through them and shake them out, that will give you a nice soft curled look.    You can also curl your hair at night before you go to bed and pin the curls to your head, in the morning just pull the curls out, spray on a little frizz ease and your good to go     :)|`|SskJEp5waa	i have the same type of hair and i use rollers that i sleep in (you can get these in so many stores). These give you perfect ringlets. Also you can try using straighteners and carefully turn them round that can give you curls. You can change how thick and bouncy you want them.    Hope this helps.|`|mOBDEBDZaa	take your curling iron and put it at the top of your hair. then wrap the hair around it (keeping it at the top). hold it for a couple seconds, and then let go, the tighter you pull it around the curler, then the smaller ringlet they will be.    hope this helps. (its what i do)
hnItHP6yaa	Yeah.  First off, it would look alright.    Second off, IT'S HALLOWEEN!  LOL.  Everyone would look weird.  :)|`|9LTWa08Laa	that doesnt match..  unless you have black uggs  try wearing black ballet flats or something|`|zHpyTBnqaa	tht's sounds really cute!

You could get bangs, either side swept bangs or full bangs.  If you want an edgy look, you could always get lots of layers and angles    A hairstyle you could do is a half pony, it always looks cute...  another one is to tease it until you have a lot of volume... Try it, see if it works for you. Experiment with your hair. Good luck!!!!!!|`|CwTXgy1Faa	they say using biosilk really helps your hair if it is damaged thats why i put biosilk on before and after i straighten it    later on i got tired of using a flat iron everyday so i straightened it at the salon now when i wet it it wont go away for atleast 6 months it cost me 80 bucks and it took 4 hours but it is worth it!!    trust me on this    -jenn|`|3RKyV6XNaa	if you are that pissed with your hair get a bob haircut but i suggest you straten your hair first|`|9UJZpcWMaa	well since your hair is damaged, do you always use conditioner? what keeps it more healthy looking, you use shampoo, rinse, put in conditioner, and keep it in for about 2 minutes, then rinse.|`|BPyiamTJaa	Get Curly hair, I think it looks hot on women.

Everyone has issues with a part of their body. Your best bet is to get walking or riding your bike try eating healthy and avoiding junk food. If you cant get out walking or riding your bike because of the weather find things to do indoors like squats and get an exercise ball there are thousands of things you can do with those they range anywhere from 10-20 dollars and are a blast to work out with. But in general make sure you don't obsess and make sure you have fun while doing this.|`|PBUkxDm1aa	u dont need 2 work out ur 2 young!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|i9MjyC48aa	my advice  start a sport that uses your lefs a lot   ballet or gymnastic  it'll be fun    also  go to  http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Get-Ski...|`|fP05qJ26aa	well u must have pretty legs just every1 doesn't like something bout them! tippy toe for 3 seconds and then do it 40 time! then put lotion on before and wear long cotton pants( every1 has 1 pair of cotton plaid pjs) and in the morning reapply! silky smooth legs! enjoy yummy lol

RD5poCIIaa	the wave will make your face softer. I got a small patch of pimples and still hasnt cleared it up. But its a great face cleaner to get rid of an oily face.  I did try neutrogenas on spot treatment and it cleared it up in a few days. The only problem was my face had an allergic reaction but it went away the next day with the pimples redness. Hope i helped =D|`|o5Cv8yj5aa	just use St. Ive's apriot scrub for great results and it isnt expensive either. for me it worked in like 2 days soo ya. you can get that stuff anywhere.    or you can use clean and clear. it works great as well and way better than proactive. get there morning face wash as well as their acne cream.

Suerte ;)|`|5de74aa0b3d6922d9fc2605d44ac35ffaa	Hola, lo mejor es llevar ropa que combine con tu personalidad y eso depende de lo que "le vendiste" a tu chico.

Suerte en tu cita!!!|`|zBG1x0sHaa	colocate con lo q mas te sientas comoda y segura... suerte xd
xRMDCcjHaa	seven jeans are crap and seven for all mankind are high fashion designer jeans worth 400 dollars a pair. I have a pair of both and the quality of the seven jeans just isnt the same as the seven for all mankind|`|ANwQUFdnaa	seven are more expensive...and dont get levis, well you could cause they are nice, but seven rocks they are really good jeans...    but actually the jeans are the same but its just two different collections that seven made|`|MGji2b7zaa	well theyre basically the same thing.  if you buy them at mervyns or something theyre the cheapo version.  but if you go to macys, nordstroms, bloomingdales, or any other department store you will find the good quality yet mildly expensive ones.|`|XVTcoLZ7aa	This might not be right but the seven jean may be just reg. jeans and i think for all mankind is a "go green" type of jeans that might be but i recommend doing some research on it if you really want to know.    :]|`|tiUo6a6zaa	it's the same brand...they are so 2000! lol|`|Q06InngZaa	Sevens were actaully around first. They sued Seven for Mankind when they came out. (and lost) SfAm are "designer" jeans. Sevens are not has high priced or "designer". It just depends on what you like. I wouldn't call them a cheap imitation. Sevens were actually around before SfAm|`|wZXYPJJZaa	sevens are a nickname for seven for all mankind.....|`|d58b309273ebd42b760acc6c44bcd855aa	they're the same, people just call them sevens for short.  i love them. :)|`|R4mgRY3daa	I think seven is more expensive. Like theres Ralph Lauren but then there's Ralph Lauren Blue Label. And there is Vera Wang and there Simply Vera.|`|c1huC8gMaa	Yes...Seven jeans are just a cheap imitation brand of Seven for all mankind.  Like somebody said previously, seven for all mankind are very expensive...but the other ones are just whatever.|`|VmqezobEaa	nope! they're the same...sevens is just the shortened version...i love them...they're super comfy!!!|`|2ljEzxzXaa	No, they're both crap. Get some Levis.    Edit: And not Levi Strauss Signature. Those are cheap ****. Get the real Levi's brand. They hold up for years and look better than any designer jeans.|`|mn8yGAudaa	I wouldn't think so.

Hot topic has them, journeys and other stored like foot locker
kT1Zlydkaa	i have it too its really pretty! you can use a primer or what i do is use a cream eye shadow as a base. mac shade sticks usually work,(make sure you rub it between your hands first so it goes on smoothly!) if your really want the colour 2 pop use a dark shade underneath like shark skin, if you are looking for a more subtle look it looks great over a black eyeliner like fluidline or any other liquid liner you have! as long as the liner is still a bit wet use an eyeshadow brush and make sure you really press the glitter in over the liner, sticks well to my fluidline and looks great! hope this helps :D|`|QGU7JAIUaa	Using an eyeshadow primer will help the glitter stick to your eyelid and make it stay put. MAC's prep + prime eye is pretty good. (: x
akAJJfdOaa	Bronzer from Bare Minerals is great. I use Warmth and it works great. It may look dark, but like all Bare Mineral products, a little bit works wonders!|`|AA10552781	bareMinerals Faux Tan All-Over Face Color.    Hope that helped.

Kwhhm53Laa	UIhm, when you say mexicans that sounds very racist :/  You probably mean like hispanics have super curly hair .  & no I dont think there is such a thing as taking pills for curly hair .  You can use a  spiral iron, it makes your hair very curly & pretty .
d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	if you want it straight at all times, make sure you blow dry it straight and use a Hair Serum to keep your hair from frizzing.  Once it starts to frizz from heat or moisture in the air, it will get wavy, so blow dry or straighten.|`|BC1XNijIaa	chemical straightener|`|ohVrgtjGaa	wash ur hair well.then leave it to dry,then use an iron.

5x9EbHWlaa	Layers look good in peoples hair except when they are kids and young. But anyway you will still be able to put your hair up unless you make the layers short and your hair is really long.|`|2BjpRnL0aa	nooo !  i have layes and they look sooo gorgeous !  && your hair will NEVER fall and it looks really cute in a pony tail|`|L4RAKdbSaa	who ever told u that has put wrong ideas to your head. :)  a)   no not bad example  b)   no your are just cutting your hair they would not damage your hair.  c)   yes, try a better shampoo that doesn't let hair fall and strengthens it.     :)|`|qkmsixWXaa	Layers won't damage your hair unless you straighten your hair a lot that you get split ends instantly, then it would damage your hair from everywhere, not just the tips. You can probably still do your hair in updos if the layers aren't that short, if not bobby pins or hairspray would do the trick.|`|JHEeoyONaa	Layers will not damage your hair. And it depends on how short you get them cut as to whether or not they'll affect being able to put your hair up.|`|EK8igZynaa	no no no no! I love layers they always look so good on every one! and it is no prob pulling your hair up so get layers I am suer you will be happy with the results|`|WoeA75yoaa	Well it really depends on the cut. Naturally some layers will be shorter than others so they might fall out. They shouldn't damage your hair. Getting a hair cut is actually good for your hair. Layers give your hair more body and movement. I'd say go for it! :)|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	It depends about how long you have your layers. No it does not damage your hair. Talk to your stylist and tell her what you would like your hair to do
oAC5fcEgaa	i think so
DwZWZfiQaa	no it woulnt just wear what you want or whaever makes you happy|`|23XLxgnmaa	honestly i think its for every one. i see all types of ppl wearing it, preps, gangsters,laid back so i dont think it metters who wears it as long as you wear it right and with confidence anything will look good!|`|SYkVbUgxaa	UMMM IDK I LOVE PACSUN ABERCOMBIE ALL THAT JUSSIE DOES THAT MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A POSER? HMMM  NEVER THOUGH ABOUT IT.|`|ctn7dNiWaa	what? 1st off, the true prep style isn't abercrombie, hollister, and american eagle. Its lacoste, ralph lauren, lilly pulizter, j crew, brooks brothers, rainbows, seven for all man kind, hudson, and the million other brands of jeans. So obviously someone with that style wouldn't ever wear something from Pacsun. Now, someone who assumes they are preppy and wear Abercrombie polo's exposing there stomach, and a pair of jeans 3 sizes to tight wore something from pacsun I guess some they could be called a poser, because they are always saying how "preppy" they are|`|AA10168765	no it wouldnt i freakin luv pac sun|`|UYAS5jP1aa	I think yes if your whole wordrobe was like pacsun but if you hav like a couple things then maybe not...|`|UcBsfrCNaa	deff not|`|6wfGwgdmaa	hehehe     wear wut u want shane will still love u     lmao  xoxo|`|exlJ1zuEaa	We'll its "name brand" so its pretty famous.

And if people do think you look like a "poser" then they need to waste their time on something else. That is so 6th grade and no one should care! You can shop where you want. If you like, you like it, and they can get over themselves.
yFqCWVgaaa	ya just get the right polish|`|fHXgZegzaa	i think polish would work(:|`|nn26sXugaa	doc martens polish :)    the idea is to build up a layer of polish over the area, so just apply, shine, wait a few minutes.. and then  reapeat 2 or 3 times.    you could also try  the doc martens brand "wonder balsam"  aswell  ive never tried it myself, but my friend thinks the world of it.     gotta love the docs:)

MthIvBZ3aa	Use 100% cocoa butter or Vitamin E oil! Whichever you use, be consistent with it and you will definitely see results.  The cocoa butter should be no more than $2-3 a stick; can be found at a beauty supply store or a natural health store and the Vitamin E oil can be about $6-8 a bottle and is found at a natural health store.

Peace  GG|`|cagE3WGPaa	You're only 15, skin cells still grow and replenish themselves every 3-4 weeks. At 15 you have optimal skin elasticty and resiliency too. Try an exfoliant like neutrogena face scrub or an apricot face scrub daily, follow w/non scented, oil free moisturizer. Wear sunblock always, sun darkens scars, makes them look worse. Over the next few years, those scars will fade a lot and may be barely noticeable in your 20's. Scars are permanent if deep and only demabrasion or laser treatments will remove deep pitted scarring. Wait a few years first, then decide.

Have you ever thought about just getting it cut to shoulder length and getting it layered? I really think that would look better on you...C:    And I think a dark mahogany brown with a hint of red would look really good.

RFTvAfILaa	Hi Sarah :) In answer to all your questions...    Have you found your skin drying out?     No, never.    Does it give just a light coverage or can you build it up without looking like you have caked it on?    I have bad skin, and I can always get away with wearing lots.    Does it go into fine lines and wrinkles?     No more than any other foundation.    Has anyone used the one from Avon?    I use a Maybelline one.    Does it allow for your skin to breath and does it blend in well if you apply a moisturiser 1st or does that make it hard to apply?    Always cleanse, tone and moisturize before applying makeup. If you do this, it will blend fine. And yes, it should help your skin breath a lot better than all these liquid foundations.    Do they rub off/wear off easily during the day?    If applied well over a good base, they shouldn't      Hope I helped, overall I'd say, go for it! They're great for your skin and feel light and fresh on your face. Definitely worth it.    Rosie|`|a4e950b61cb1447e34460ba0d35e5f08aa	I use Maybelline Pure Foundation Mineral, colour 73 Dune. I wear a light base of foundation cream and then apply the powder lightly, I think it is great, it lasts all day does not come of onto my collars, and covers blemishes. It is expensive but lasts for ages. It comes of easily with make up remover. It does not dry up my skin. I always use a face moisturiser before the foundation. I have found that it lasts all day. It is great!  Never tried the Avon one because I think I love the one that I use, and no caked feel at all!|`|MG7CLjtjaa	bareMinerals is amazing stuff. It's expensive but if you apply it correctly, people will not notice you're wearing makeup    So no, it doesn't dry out the skin. Light coverage is all I need. I'm not sure because I don't have fine lines or wrinkles yet. Never used the one from avon. Yes, it blends well when moisturizer is applied before. To be honest, it does fade a bit during the day. But the coverage is still there. Hope I helped|`|PhTKb3JUaa	I use physician's formula Organic Mineral Wear.  I really like it.  It's the first stuff I've ever used that doesn't make me feel like I'm wearing a mask yet still covers what I need it to.  It depends on how you apply it.  The brush will put a light amount on your face and the sponge will get more on there.  I usually use a sponge and then toilet paper to wipe off the extra stuff (a bit silly. I know.)  I don't think mine wears off easily.  I don't apply any after my first application in the morning, and I do just fine.|`|ewPhe57Daa	I'm not a huge fan.  It's ok.  I included a link to a website where you can try it free, you just have to pay for shipping.  I did this with some eye shadows, and it was a great way to experiment and try different colors.  And you aren't out a lot of money if you don't like it.|`|vz7XaCmFaa	i use raw mineral and it works wonders fo me you should try it.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	Personally, I don't like the mineral foundation I have tried... but I haven't tried Bare Minerals, so I don't know if that is any good.|`|30bMKWFYaa	 use creme to powder foundation. minerals foundation most likely makes you look made up. you want not to be noticed because of your make-up|`|OLjBhX5Qaa	I am currently using rimmel's lasting finish foundation. I find that it doesnt cover as well as my usual makeup but it does feel nicer on my skin. I bought a powder that is mineral too but managed to get it all smashed up in my bag within a day :S   I always apply moisturisers before makeup but let it sink in first. The makeup sits alright but just very shiney so diff need powder to ''set'' the makeup. Havent tried any others. Hope this helps :)|`|ERombB2Kaa	I have tried several different mineral foundations and have come up with the same result for them all: they suck.    I am generally pretty good at applying make up, but this is just a huge mess, it looks cakey and it does not wear well throughout the day.   I saw a picture of myself wearing some of it one time and yikes, it was awful.     Moisturizers do make it hard to apply. It seems to create more wrinkles than it hides.     (: Do yourself a favor and go with something else. Lately I have liked those new foundations that go on white and blend in to your natural color.    But mineral foundation doesn't live up to all the hype. |`|zMKgN1Poaa	Ive used bare minerals and i love it.  -I didnt find that IT made my skin dry, but if your skin is dry already, it doesnt look the best on top of it, so keep your skin moisturized.  -it has great coverage with a very natural look, of course if you put enough it will look caked, but you dont need it  -i found if you put a little concealer on your dark spots or undereye, it helps to reduce the appearance with the powder  -never tried avon  -i always used moistuizer before! becuase like i said, when you put the powder on top of dry skin, it doesnt look the best...so yes, use the lotion, let that airdry, then apply the powder  -my bare minerals really stayed on all day, looked fresh, has a ligh healthy shimmer to it..    i would say try it..i went back to liquid foundation and i hate it. it makes my face feel overgreasy or over dry depending on the day, its messy compared to the powder..im switching back as soon as im done with this makeup|`|aOZ9UGEYaa	I've used the mineral foundation from avon and I have very sensitive skin. When I use the foundation my skin does not dry out and it doesn't look caked on when you build it up but I found that I must use the sheer powder to get a natural look. I don't have any wrinkles yet. But when I apply a moisturizer it makes for a more difficult application. But again maybe it depends on what kind of moisturizer you use...cacao butter works best for my skin. I don't have a problem with it rubbing off throughout the day.  Oh, I must say that I love the Avon mineral eye shadows. They go on smooth and complement my skin well. My favorites are sapphire pink and midnight mauve.  But I still can't wait to try BareMinerals. |`|I1nnjlapaa	Ok Mineral Foundation is the BEST. I dont care what anyone says- it is the best.     1. Sometimes. Use a moisturizer and/or primer under it but make sure it dries before applying the foundation. BareMinerals is about to release a hydrating Mineral Veil- it will be available during the holiday season, and then on shelves permanently in June 09. This will help. a LOT.     2. You can control the coverage- I have yet to see someone make it looked caked on.     3. it smoothes them out if thats what your asking. especially with the mineral veil. That helps- nice soft touch.     4. no. I have never used this but I have used Pur Minerals, Bare, Jane Iredale and others. Bare Essentials brand is the best.     5. yes, your skin can breath. dosent even feel like you have makeup on. As far a moisturizer- you have to be careful. I use dove moisturizer but I have to wait a few minutes before putting the mineral makeup on because if it is still wet, your face can get spotty. application is key.     6. depends on what you're up to during the day. I find that using the Mineral Veil makes it last much longer. It dosent rub off too easily- I dont have a bunch of stains on my clothes, but using a primer or some kind of setting will help. |`|RGYjvtY2aa	I have tried to mineral makeup foundations, Bare Minerals and Avon Smooth Mineral Makeup.    Yes, I have found mineral makeup to be quite drying on my skin.    Mineral foundations are definitely sheer-medium coverage. They can also be applied wet for more coverage and can serve as a concealer, too.    It doesn't sink into lines quite as much as a liquid.    Yes, it had too many shimmers for my taste, but the coverage was sheer, it made my skin glow.    Mineral foundations are a lot less pore clogging than a liquid foundations. Mosturizer always needed but especially when you're dealing with a mineral foundations. Wait for it to dry so it gets applied evenly and doesn't get spotty.    bare minerals says it's water proof/resistant and I've seen that it definitely lives up to it. It does last at day, it doesn't get on my clothes or hands if I touch my face.
4V3LVIc4aa	well i got mine done and it hurt a lot and was very swollen and i had to take it out within 4 hours. but not everyone has this happen. i think u should wait untill u r 16 and get it done. its not like a tatto u can just take it out when u dont want it anymore. i have had my eyebrow done 3 times. i had to take it out because of jobs i have had. jobs dont really like piercings. i also had my labria done too.|`|HLmd17r9aa	You can IM or email me for all of the information you would like. I've had mine done for over 3 years and have never had any problems, but your question is kind of vague to answer.    What kinds of things would you like to know exactly?|`|rZNuErcwaa	Well first off if you have a tongue ring then you have a good chance of chipping your teeth and it also rots your teeth because your mouth produces saliva to try to dissolve what is in your mouth that isn't supposed to be there and so in turn it rots your teeth instead. |`|JsA9CY1Taa	first of all, my opinion is that you do not get your tongue pierced    It's the most annoying thing you could have on your body.    And by statistics, most people remove it after 6-9 months when they felt it was uncomfortable and not worth the beauty and trend.      Not worth it at all.... so don't do it..  |`|NTC6g8hYaa	I wouldn't do it. You can get allergic reactions  from it and your tong swells up for about a week or two....i've seen it...it isnt pretty!|`|apsoOSmHaa	Tongue piercing looks kool but there's also risks involved.  Tongue piercing is normally safe, but it is theoretically possible that it could lead to infection with hepatitis B, hepatitis C or HIV, and it can cause other health problems. So think very carefully about the risks before having it done.    Obviously you must make sure that the person doing the piercing is experienced and that the piercing parlour is hygienic. This may be difficult, because there are no official qualifications or training standards for body piercers in the UK. Check the piercer uses clean needles for each person, disposable gloves and antiseptics, and has a sharps box (as in a doctors surgery) for disposing of each used needle. The jewellery is not sterile, so ideally the piercer should sterilize it in an autoclave (as in a doctors surgery). Usually, however, the jewellery is wiped with antiseptic or boiled before insertion; this lessens the risk of infection but not as absolutely as autoclaving. Ask about all of this before you decide to have it done    My advice, wait till your 16, find out more about it, good bits and bad including the possible damage to your teeth by the jewelery.|`|OmMfyffGaa	lucky i want my lip pierced nd my mom said i cnt get it til i move out of her house!!!!! i might move with my dad but he might move 2 florida ooo and go 2 google.com |`|7c30e5f364968a68403f660d7f0c948faa	i was 14 when i got my tounge pierced.      it dosent hurt but you need to make sure its something you really wanna do, cause its not worthbit if u do it then 2 weeks later take it out.

Kwhhm53Laa	Dont use Pantene in the long run it really doesn't help your hair but makes it worse .  You can search on youtube on how to tease your hair & they really do help you out a lot .  It probably gets frizzy from overteasing ? But remember  to brush it down to get rid of some frizz, just not so much  that you brush at all your hard work .  I think the shampoo & conditioner you are using are fine though  so that's not a problem .|`|e8raYCzIaa	alriiight. first of all.  if you want a scene look get your hair extremely thinned out on the bottom.  ask your hairdresser to make it like wispy-ish. really thin  and don't get too short of layers if you want BIG    you should also switch to a better shampoo and conditioner product.  like paul mitchell or redkin.    and for teasing, it would be a good idea to watch videos on youtube.  but basically just take a very fine toothed comb and take -smalll- sections from your crown area of your head all the way around.  just tease tease tease a whole section around your head then spray.  then do another section down from that one and so on.  and when you have those just lightly take them down and separate them with your fingers then lay the next one down and separate those.  and then VERY lightly brush the top of your hair with a brush so the tease is underneath and you can't see it. then spray some more you know. and PRACTICEE|`|5c37fe67eb9da01203e3f28f39525434aa	i asked a girl at my school, she suggested to me getting short layers at the very top. she said it makes it easier to tease (:    i like to spray my hair with hairspray lightly before i start teasing then after wards apply more hairspray.|`|ind4ZbEcaa	um.................... u dont need to tease much if u have THICK hair     Lucky!!!|`|Fjv6D3lRaa	yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!!

37PpYx8oaa	Hey, I just did this last week.  But I use Punky Color brand hair dye, they are definitely the best for unnatural colors.  For bleach I used Quick blue with a volume 30 cream.  If you have dark hair like I did you'll need to bleach your hair out twice, leaving the bleach in for about 40 minutes each time.    Good Luck and don't forget the Vaseline!

vNOxGgasaa	if you wanted to do it yourself it would be complicated with all the layers, and the bangs especially.  I would say go to a hair salon, and SHOW them the picture, so you would get the results you really want, :]    hope this helps|`|VtZN0ov0aa	Go to the hair salon and definitely take the picture or it will end up wrong. They will give you advice on products that will keep it like that =D|`|GQn5OC6baa	well if you mean like styling it (like you already have the bangs)  then yes you can. all you do is straighten it and curl the ends under. or if your hair is naturally straight then take a curling iron and curl the ends. and make sure when you straighten the bangs that you make the round and curled. if you make your bangs too straight they'll wind up looking greasy and that's not cool.     if you mean cut the bangs yourself then don't do it. i no it looks easy but if you screw it up there's no going back. and its not as easy at it looks you have to cut it so its textured and slightly thin. if your bangs are too full then it will look weird. so whatever you do don't cut bangs by yourself.|`|u2nMoYaqaa	I dunno, but I want that done for my hair now! I would go to a salon.|`|xTUsJG3kaa	Hair Salon I think.|`|SskJEp5waa	This would be best to go to a salon with. if it goes wrong then you could have bad hair for a very long time.

Wear something comfortable like a long sleeved shirt with a hoodie.  Take a nicer top or sweater that you can layer to wear with the cords.  You might want to take some nicer black pants just in case, and wear them with the same things you would wear with the cords.  That way you have some choices.  If you have an athletic type of pants, like yoga pants, take them just to have!  Hope this helps!
FnQWXyp8aa	wowww your really attractive, anyways...mane and tail shampoos are rumored to make your hair grow longer, you know also the standard "haircut every 6 weeks", just keep it healthy, hair grows about an inch a month, so it takes some time.|`|7nrhPCf0aa	hate to break it to you but it's growing up instead of down|`|AA11560792	the more you wash it and brush it the more it will grow ...hope this helps good luck...|`|yYRvgnk7aa	When I changed my diet from fast foods, refined foods, and heavy greasy foods to healthy, baked, broiled, and all natural, this is when I began to see my long term permanent hair growth. It became a way of life to eat healthy as so the length of my hair began to permanently flourish. Vitamin supplements that are truly potent can and will aid in a healthy head of hair. You can still eat healthy and take vitamins for the over all affects. e.g., bones, skin, brain function, energy, etc. Listed on the charts below are alternatives to vitamin supplement intake and/or food intake.    You should intake lots of Vitamin A (Fish liver oils, dairy products, liver) and Vitamin B-5 ( Beef, chicken, liver, eggs, salmon, clams, royal jelly, rice, avocados, grains, nuts).

hYKwsyfHaa	I read that people wear 20 percent of their wardrobe 80 percent of the time.  I try to take that  into perspective when buying new clothes...    1. Chose quality over quantity  2. Don't buy things just because they are on sale or seem like a great deal.  3. When you go shopping consider if something will go with a lot of the clothes you already own.  4. Take an invetory of your clothes twice a year by going through them, trying them on, and discarding the items you haven't worn in the past year or two (take them to the thrift store or whatever).  Then you begin to see which items you will need to replace for that season.  Buy those things and don't impulsively buy other things you don't need.       Some clothes are really good multitaskers.  A good cardigan is priceless in the winter, you can wear it day end and day out.  Of course investing in a nice pair of jeans doesn't hurt, you won't regret it.  Other items like a nice jacket, a little black dress, a pair of leather boots, a cute blazer, an A-line wool skirt in a neutral shade, all of those items are key peices that will go a long way in anyone's wardrobe.|`|SQWvMx6Maa	Ask yourself 3 questions    Is it necessary?

What works for you now won't work for you 5 years from now.    Good Luck!|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	Both are good brands.   I use mostly Revlon.

Higher quality brands are better for ulitmate basics - foundations, cover ups, etc. A cheap makeup can look cakey and can make your skin brake out. If you have sensetive skin, stick with brands you are familiar with. Covergirl and Maybelline are pretty much equal - it's fine to buy fun items from these brands for experimenting and playing around. Either brand is fine. Look into M.A.C, Shiseido, Dior and Chanel because they have great high end ivestements, but Quo and Gosh at Shoppers Drugmart are also great and very inexpensive. I reccomend these brands over Covergirl and Maybelline.    Good luck shopping!|`|tx8iEBgAaa	I'd go for maybelline if I had to choose.... I only use their masacara, because I change it every month or so and its cost effective...    from a regular store, Almay is the best.    to indulge yourself, go for bare minerals or just have fun on sephora.com =))|`|vgQBoU4Uaa	all the way CoverGirl!|`|2kZm6pcnaa	maybe its covergirl|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Maybelline is better than covergirl by far!      Rimmel is also another good brand and is inexpensive    But it really depends on what you're looking for such as foundation, mascara, eyeliner, lipstick, etc. because each brand can be better than others for that certain make up product|`|Btdc7eQOaa	maybelline|`|aEFTqJOtaa	Cover girl for me. but whatever works best for you|`|r6FS7fCbaa	i love to use rimmel    LOVE

Mix 3 tablespoons of olive oil with 2 tablespoons of honey. Apply to your hair and wrap your head in plastic film or put on a shower hat. Leave for at least 30 minutes and then shampoo as usual, rinsing well.    try the morrocan oil, i hear that they have good products.   http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw?url...|`|2GubMjldaa	go to a salon and talk to someone with experience    get good advice    you're at risk of having it all go to pieces and end-up looking poorly|`|18afBRSXaa	dont dye it again!

C5Wlt3rGaa	Whenever you get your hair trimmed and get off all the dead ends,  It does seem to grow a lot faster.  Get your hair trimmed every 6 weeks or so.
R6Z8onywaa	im sooo small too, this one piece is the best thing ever!  http://www1.bloomingdales.com/catalog/pr...|`|oHO0XOQVaa	If it's something more rockabilly/50s like this it can make you look curvier? Low on the hips and then the fabric seamed to go around your breasts like that. (minus the weird ruffles on the legs)    http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/urban/cat...
UByvC54Xaa	You can most definately dread your hair. Being that your hair is straight and silky though, backcombing would be the best method to achieve dreadlocks or otherwise the neglect method.    If you are interested in the backcombing method, what it is generally is your hair is sectioned or small sections are grabbed, and using a metal lice comb (or dreading comb) you brush the hair back towards the scalp. You need to start off with clean hair though. This is not achieved with normal shampoo though as normal shampoo leaves residues in your hair and it makes it so much harder for your hair to knot up. You need a residue free shampoo. You can buy these at your health store or specifically dread shampoos like knottyboy or dreadheadhq.    There is really too much information to list in yahoo answers, but if you would to email me with more questions, I would be more than happy to help. holeandcorgan@hotmail.com    Dreads are not dirty, neglected hair if maintained and looked after properly.|`|iXGgZbNxaa	Yes, you can have dreadlocks with straight hair. It takes a little longer than someone with nappy hair but its possible.
ToWc1yYYaa	Firstly to make the scent last longer you should layer with the same shower gel and body lotion, this will make it last twice as long.    Spray it on your pulse points, so on your wrists, behind your ears, back of knees (weird but the scent rises!). On your pulse points the scent will heat up throughout the day so it won't just smell for the first hour or two.    When you do spray it, make sure that you don't spray it close enough that it just dribbles. If it looks like a liquid when it is on the skin all you are getting is the alcohol. Try to spray it from about 20-30cm away, and don't rub it in, it bruises the scent and won't allow all the notes to show.    To finish off, a couple of sprays to the clothes and hair will leave a lasting scent when you move.     Quick tip too is if you spray a little bit onto your finger and run it over your hairline on the top of your head, again this heats up throughout the day and the hair gived off the most pheremones to compliment the fragrance.    Happy spraying :)|`|bm6NX6nTaa	When you apply you only need to spray once or twice. Believe this of not, when your brain gets used to the perfume you use your brain begins to block out the scent causing you to believe you need to reapply. The brain is weird I know and I've wasted penalty of perfume. Spray on your wrist, neck and spray once in the air and walk through.|`|a0p16oJTaa	Read the instructions.|`|cfzxFEVEaa	your wrists, neck, and it sounds weird, but the back of your knees...    these are areas that get the warmest on your body, and the warmth helps to scent become stronger|`|p5skbQToaa	put it on your neck wrists and anywhere else you feel lol  try spraying into the air and walking into it :) it helps the smell go on anywhere and you will smell good for a really long time.    spray then walk through, spray again and walk backwards in to the purfume.|`|SiGVPuFmaa	I spray it on my stomach and chest before I get dressed. When you spray it on your wrists, don't rub them together because it makes the smell go away twice as fast.     It always works for me. I always get "You smell so good" comments.    I use:    -LILU from Pac sun  -CURIOUS Brittney Spears' perfume  -CAN CAN by Paris Hilton
DtEmi5Z5aa	Well I Think Guys With Straightened Hair Is Pretty Cut :)     Maybe You Should Straighten It Out All The Way And Get Some Hair Wax and put it on The Ends of The Hair and Sort Of Flip It Out So That It Doesn't Look ALL Straightened.    And If You Don't Like It, Just Jump In The Shower.    Your Hair Goes Back To Normal When You're in The Shower ^_^    http://www.style-hair-magazine.com/image...|`|RKV7xd3Naa	NAH! its perfectly okay to straighten your hair it will look so much better. you should straight iron it whenever you wash your hair if you et it wet you make it wavy/curly. but you may also want to buy some protectant spray so yuo dont get split ends dont know what those are. . .think about it . . . .SPLIT. . .ENDS okay now what are we talking about? hair hmmm. . .lol i dont know. . .most guys are totally clueless about them.|`|5Etwhg5Iaa	Hey well it's your choice what you do with your hair , but i know alot of guys with that kinda hair and yeah sometimes they get called gay but they get over it personally i don't like it , i love the spiky hair look ! Umm it could take a month to four months if you chemically straighten it , i reccoment just using straighteing irons , and some straightening balm.|`|VQzYYYaEaa	Some guys look good with it.  But some guys overstraighten their hair so they have dry split ends and it looks awful.  Running a straightener through your hair quickly and then using Bedhead products, like a little bit of hairspray, is the best way to go.|`|NzezdETKaa	its not gay,it looks good|`|IjZq5z6Kaa	its not gay at all i actually find it very sexy when a guy does that. and it lasts until you get it wet so yea its temporary you should do it like 2 or 3 times a week so it doesnt get all dried out and stuff|`|Fjv6D3lRaa	yea|`|EK8igZynaa	I dont know what your hair looks like now but here are some "surfer" hairstyles|`|kKDbi5Zwaa	yesssss!|`|kdMM7OAaaa	straighten your hair a FEW times a week or u'll kill ur hair. sorry i dont have any links because not every hair cut looks good on everyone so ya|`|yW6KCd7iaa	i think a lot of guys look hawt when they straighten their hair. if you want to keep ur hair up your gonna have to straighten hair everyday. if you dont like it mess it up ")    oh and if you straighten your hair use a heat guard spray so your hair wont damage. i use chi 44 guard. you can get cheap ones anywhere like walmart.|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	its ok.  if your gay.
1dedeaebc13ed2750f9b568a9b9cdeecaa	for the eye shadow thing,,  if you get like a 3 colored shadow container thing put the darkest on the bottem then medium then the lightest the lightest should go right up to your eye brow.     and clothing,   i shop at wet seal, its pretty cheap and they have nice stuff.  i also shop at rue 21.  they are both nice stores.|`|JCBmMtqZaa	never doubt the thrift stores, trust me, that's where you find the best, vintage is lovely and that's the best place to find it. But if that's not what your into, you can always try stores like Marshall's, a.j. wright, places like that.|`|1VOaqCvXaa	colored leggings with a light toned or black long shirt...i like ankle boots but not leather, only suede. skinny jeans are my favorite. and boots, suede boots...to the knee.    as for the eye shadow...maybe try a wet & dry eye shadow..that way it can give you 2 looks and comes with the right brushes to apply...during the day i put on eye liner first then light eye shadow over it so its not dark and drastic...and for night i put on eye shadow then darker eye liner...for a night out look.|`|YEvwjJo0aa	well, for the makeup, get a bobbi brown make up book, they help..  try shopping at american eagle or off the wall, I always find stuff there.
EWms0Hqhaa	i really like black better...|`|Zfl0c5MXaa	i would say black it makes you look more classic|`|UwRGE0Ghaa	I really like the black, but I could also see you with the reddish color that emma stone has! :)|`|vc3uRxQAaa	The black is working for you.... but redheads are just plain better than everyone else.|`|UEaPulpmaa	Black looks good for you!|`|WrrqpLhtaa	DARK HAIRRRRRRRRRR  so much prettier    i would go with a dark red almost light brown red|`|jF0l4ghraa	i think natural|`|ST23GpNTaa	aww, I really like it black! :)   Any darker shades would look nice on you, browns, plum as mentioned :)|`|9Eq9pozbaa	I do not like that blonde.  The black is really cute particularly the 4th pic on the top row, very cute, I think you should stay.    If your bored I would throw a chunk of blue and white on one side like 4 inches or so right on the top.|`|JJK0LC5Qaa	blegh, black hair looks better definitely.  makes you look classier. :D|`|pTIfKwsIaa	try a medium brown with some red tones,|`|DskzIKhnaa	i like blackkk, maybe you can lightly tint it with a maroon, plum or dark red.    the darker shades match your eyebrows and helps your eyes stand out. (:|`|5Etwhg5Iaa	The black hair looks really good and suits your style of make-up so instead of making you look washed out , and vampy (in a non flattering way) you look very classy yet not too classy and really cute and pretty. I'd stay black really but to suggest a colour i guess i would go with .. Hmm , A dark brown nearly black , or maybe mahogany ? That could look quite nice , but i think it looks super Amazing black , i love the i think it's the third picture with you smiling , STUNNING !|`|e3JE4QWHaa	Blonde looks okay, but the black hair kind of flushes you out .    I was thinking maybe this color would look better:    http://www.wiggoddess.com/images/130R.jp...|`|t0uIgY08aa	your gorgeouse with black hair... you should look into a lighter brown maybe.. blonde is not your color though...|`|2oN7WrVKaa	I think a natural Auborn color would look gorgeous on you.  Your skin is looks very washed out with the blonde, so if you had to choose out either black or blonde; stay black.  I really think you should try Dark Red/Auborn. It would be beautiful on you.  :)|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i really like it black!!|`|Fjv6D3lRaa	definatly not blonde again.  black looks pretty on you, try brown next time|`|By1DJAUOaa	that black color is too dark for your skin color and blonde doesn't go great with the make up you had on i think you should dye it brown  :) just my opinion b/c you would look nice with brown.|`|VN8kBnuRaa	To be honest with you darling, the black is somewhat harsh on your lighter complexion, and the blonde made you look harsh. I think you would look really pretty with a darker brown hair, with MAYBE a few lighter shades of brown for highlights. However if highlights aren't your thing, then I would suggest a deep brown.|`|zFwjZy53aa	dark colors, maybe plum|`|iCKkOWI7aa	black|`|lf58nWGEaa	Uhm I like black better! :]|`|BpNSm6sDaa	it messes your hair up when you die it and it looks better        anyway|`|btMmriQvaa	You look better with dark hair,  how about like black purplish-plum color|`|hBGZYDKAaa	I think you should keep it dark either black or like a darker shade of brown would look good on you.|`|dDNqiB4iaa	i like the black :)  you should try like a choclatey brown with red?  i think it would look really pretty.  i know shes annoying but check out miley cyrus's hair here    http://www.usmagazine.com/files/miley-cy...
kogfFMgmaa	blue, blonde, lavender, pink, red    i have blue and blonde streaks currently and when that fades im getting lavender and more blonde|`|fMPyLqW4aa	I like dark neon purple.|`|9BiMgggIaa	Do a hot pink.

hQNHzc6faa	Comb your hair continously while you have on conditioner and comb it while washing off your conditioner. When you towel dry your hair, don't rub your hair with the towel, it'll make it really frizzy and tangled. Instead, pat your hair dry.|`|iFYDJyIZaa	Do you dye it a lot?    It could be damaged. Any split ends? Damage makes it difficult to brush. You can also try using a Biosilk product. You can leave it in the ends of your hair. It protects it, and it also makes it easier to brush.|`|uMWIs3nBaa	you could try brushing it in the shower right before you get out because my hair does the same thing and brushing it while im still in the shower helps me|`|hMSPAq3vaa	my hair gets tangled too but sometimes i use a comb and brush it out in the shower|`|AA11612766	V05 Conditioning Hairdress.|`|bAvWkOdUaa	wash your hair the right way it says to on the bottle..  and use a brush??! most peoples hair gets tangled after a shower...lol|`|aV0QmAOtaa	Your hair probably tangles because it's too thin. Try using a baby detangle shampoo/conditoner and try on the detangle spray or a leave-in conditioner which you can apply after your shower. If this doesn't work as well for you, then I suggest you take a comb inside the shower with you, and comb your hair/detangle it while you have the conditioner on. I used to do this because my hair was really long and pretty damaged so it would always tangle after showers/drying.

OItPJZjBaa	Well, as an ex -addict(clean for 2 years now and going strong) I can only tell what it can be cut with and what it feels like. Cocaine can be cut with baby laxitive which really sucks it can really upset your stomach and make you fell like you have bad cramps.  It can be cut with baking soda which is ok.  The best yet the worst that I know of is meth which I personally found to be the most addicting.  The way I felt on it was out of control.  I just stayed in my room snorting line after line after line. It got to the point were my nose was clogged up and yet I still wanted more.  You get paranoid on it. The high only lasts about 10-20 min. depending on what it was cut with and that's way you always want more.  You also get a drip in your throat. Some addict will even lick the bag.  They call the "freeze". When they do that it numbs your tongue. Sometimes it also tastes good again depending on what it was cut with.  Well I hope this helps and please please don't ever never touch the stuff. Trust Me it's not worth it.|`|A0nRQHDCaa	Uh one. And this is not for a health project is it....|`|wKjFn7Nsaa	Lmaoooooo.  Just smoke some weed.      But for real, if you are going to do cocaine, do it once a year.  It can get waaay outta control.    One hit would get you high.

Not hot. well to me anyway|`|ikkTcqPFaa	neither|`|my3KKl4Baa	FIRST ONE!!!!!!|`|ZEvtVkuuaa	Sure. The FIRST ONE. It's hot.|`|KL45cEZraa	dont get it straight across. it would make you look too disney star. try the second one, it would look cute with your face shape and hair color!|`|HhmhSBpgaa	I've been doing hair 20 years I think your face shape would do well with bangs cut straight across it is winter so they won't make your forehead oily and if you don't like it they grow back quickly its not like cutting tons of length off. Try it, the change will be fun and then you will be ready for something different after that. Good luck.|`|TQHHH7kxaa	are you tall or slender  depending if you like the whole nile thing|`|NVPR8usJaa	Those top two girls are very unattractive. The hair is horrible! You aren't gross though so don't do that.  Try these styles for your face....|`|YAwvszITaa	yeah i think you could pull it off with no problems|`|r1KTZBkraa	get the first one|`|BpIUZyqKaa	no no no no no .|`|3Dhacs6caa	Second Haircut :D  Get highlights and side bangs.  and bangs straight across? Hmm...it depends but for some reason i think they look really cute on brunettess. Lol.|`|hQNHzc6faa	Straight across bangs will make round face look much rounder. If you really wish to have bangs, side swept ones would be better. As for the twoo choices you provided. Go with a more natural version of the first one minus the black color( you're natural hair color is nice) Don't dye hair. Good luck with the hair cut.|`|fYTcFygUaa	yeah.|`|jhFT5kT1aa	no  it would make your face look round|`|hlXxuOOTaa	yes, very cute.|`|6mf4yy92aa	neither...to old 4 u|`|hA6JDWsFaa	get straight bangs 'devil wears prada' style like anne hathaway. it'll go good with you, you have a great oval face and it'll be great for you, i know it. avoid the "scene" cut, it won't do you any good. hope this helps! :)|`|fcf19b701cb5c1c23d3acd9a598be0afaa	I like your hair the way it is now. Bangs would make you look too young.|`|224cm8qtaa	I like your hair but I would get it cut like link  2. I like that. They both look good.|`|LsE1RS0vaa	i think theyre both great and bangs straight across would be kinda cute but side swept is better.|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	yup|`|SO20Ah2Daa	no that looks terrible|`|Sucivxykaa	The 1st one would look really good!
OFHpqIbvaa	works for me
twRGS4y6aa	Well um i use my Neutrogena Wave it gets my make-up off in seconds it's really great!!! But I didn't have my Wave i would probably use wipes Liquid Make-Up remover doesnt really help get my makeup off.           Good Luck!|`|avlVHXDCaa	well wipes make ur eyes red and ichy|`|AA10531094	Vaseline is cheaper|`|jjIcSMCvaa	Wipes.|`|5PBK1Nc6aa	wipes|`|QBV4cFbqaa	i prefer the wipes it's not as messy and it works best. I don't buy the ones for make up i just use baby wipes to remove my make up. It works like a charm.|`|vYDSmapoaa	soap!|`|G2w7duPHaa	i usually use lotion.it is the best way and removes make-up by seconds
e3a09247eee956f065f69d275a013ce2aa	i don't have them.  but my sister does!   She loves her and they are really warm.    I like the black the best. =]  or sand.      lastly, i dont think you need the cleaner my sister doesnt have it. Just make sure you spray the boots with waterproofer(you can find it about anywhere. I got mine at target) and you'll be good. If they get really dirty, you have water. They're boots they're not really that delicate.|`|26lZZaWNaa	chestnut color is the best and yes buy the cleaner.
aHWGRNbDaa	Top) This is a great top! it is colorful and you cant go wrong with element, Its design is great for use with other outfits too but I found it perfect in this one. Plus! V-Necks are all the rage!  http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/tees/Primav...    Pants) These are bright, I know but delia's colored jeans are the bomb! they're perfect with white tees and even black ones! I wear them with everything. This goes with the Top the best and I found that they will make a great outfit together. If you don't want a bright jean like this I would go for a darker washed jean.  http://store.delias.com/item.do?category...    Vest) This will mellow this outfit out but still keep the color balance in tact. If you're low on money I would cut this out but it is adorable! a great finish to a great outfit.  http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...    Shoes) regular light brown uggs, if you have brown uggs or black uggs those will work too.    Hair) A yellow headband if possible =]     Sketch) this is what It should come out to look like:   http://i356.photobucket.com/albums/oo8/i...    Its a good thing we like the same stores =]  SORRY IT TOOK SO LONG|`|6RgghI66aa	You named the stores that you like shopping, so what you can do is get a lot of  cute tops, some can be dressy tops that you can wear for occasions, some for school, that cute, flirty, innocent school girl look, some can be when you go out, just want to shine like... bam lol. As for bottoms you can buy skinny jeans in a variety of colors[that seems to be the style], dressy pants [again for occasions], pair of black pants/ jeans that you can wear during the week, and skirts can be either long, medium sized, or short to a length that's reasonable enough to get that feminine look. As for shoes: flats, converses, nike, sneakers, pair of black dress shoes, pair of heels, pumps, boots uggs, shoes that can go with any season. In the end it's your style have fun!!!!|`|W50zzBQoaa	i think you should go for a reallly cute indie look. kinda form your own look. at least thats what i do! :] i shop at forver 21 alot and charlotte russe which are great places to get really cute clothes!  i think a cute out fit would be a cute pair of brown or black knitted flat boots not healed. and a jean skirt with leggings. make sure the leggings and shirt your wearing have a somewhat resemblence. ok? then a cute shirt would be one of those plaid button up shirts then roll the sleeves up a little bit and wear a cute white cami underneath. you could get a blue plaided button up shirt and blue leggings. that would be adorable!    an outfit i have is brown knitted flat boots, a really cute holey skirt from hollister, black leggings, a black plaided button up shirt i wear and roll up the sleeves and a beater underneath. ITS SOOOO FRIKEN CUTE! ive had so many people ask me where i get my clothes trust me it would look great. especially because you sound really petite. it would look great on you. then wear a long silver vintage necklace or somthing  that has a bird or somthing on it which you could also get at forever 21 or charlotte russe :] :]     to switch up the look get different unique shirts in different colors to match the leggings. you'll always have a different outfiittttt and you can make the look really colorful the way you like it :]    i hope i helpedddddddd!|`|mjshqfuyaa	http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/images/co...    http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/images/co...    http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/images/co...    http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/images/co...      there yahh go :]|`|oojVKGjCaa	Hmm dont be like others with your shirt and the BIG abercrombie or Hollister, Punks are so cool just take their style ( punks are not emo!!!)   its cool and rocker baby yeah|`|17acJiqKaa	jeans:   http://shop.pacsun.com/girls/jeans/hermo...    sweatshirt:  http://store.delias.com/item.do?category...    tank top:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|tLcGyPflaa	http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...              http://www.abercrombie.com/webapp/wcs/st...                  http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...              http://www.payless.com/Catalog/productde...                http://www.payless.com/Catalog/ProductDe...

Sweet. Stores you picked are awesome    Shop From:  H&M  AMERICAN EAGLE  for awesome cheap clothing    Start with some skinny jeans that are a little tight but snug and fit.  Try some good hoodies or polos  Mix and match with the shirts for great results    The Mannequins in H&M and American Eagle usually look great on anyone, so try some of that.    Good Luck ;)|`|MVtsGqNJaa	You could try something a little different like this top.  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    and wear it with some dark skinny jeans and black flats.  Jewelry - where a long black necklace, this will create a look that concentrates on height.  you could where whatever black earrings too|`|70iWkzUKaa	Ooooo...... your definitely my typa girl lol i   LOVE those stores, heres a complete outfit i found at forever.... idk the price range you were thinking of but everything here together is $140.50.... but definitly hott!!! http://www.forever21.com/images/looks/lo...
RmChZ7YHaa	http://cbtscloset.com/    When you get to the site, click on laser cut jewelry, necklaces, and then you should see the diamond necklace towards the bottom. They're like 18 bucks since they're from GB I believe, but they're super cool looking...like 3 inches big and you can pick from an array of colors...they even have some mirror finishes. I'm thinking of getting one myself.    Plus, the other necklaces are awesome as well!|`|iXWXllhQaa	try:    journeys.com  hottopic.com  wetseal.com  charlotterusse.com  forever21.com  claires.com    they have a variety of jewelry. i hope you find what you're looking for~

vIr0Y0EVaa	Don't pick at them, that will just make them worse. And some women get acne before their periods, it's just another part to the curse. Get some cover up if you think it's embarrassing for people to see, but wash it off at night. And maybe a spot treatment to get rid of them? Hope I helped out.|`|CfUVG6IYaa	Yes, your hormones that become elevated around the time of your period definitely can cause pimples. It still happens to me every month and I am thirty-something!    Even though you don't have bangs, if your hair is long, it can end up in your face at night while you sleep. So, what you put in your hair can make you break out on your face. Oily styling products can block your pores. Keep that in mind - you could try not using a styling product for a while and see if that helps.    Keep your skin clean, but don't wash too frequently because that causes problems too. Twice a day (in the morning and before you go to bed) is good.     The best over-the-counter acne medicine I have found is Neutrogena Rapid Clear Gel:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0013HD7MM?smid...    Good luck!  :-)|`|2TDBlBbNaa	Pimples cause problems and headaches to a lot of people.  I know you may be tempted to do so, but please do not try to pick it with your nails when it is still red. You should leave it alone for a couple of days and it will appear not as red and painful.  If you pick on it, it could cause skin inflammation.  I've tried Proactive before, and it find it too overdrying and not very effective with continue use.  One product that I used in the past to combat pimples is MD Formulations facial cleaner.  It contains Glycolic acid which improves the skin's appearance and texture. It also reduces wrinkles and acne scarring.  You should use an SPF 15 or higher sunscreen on your face when you use this cleanser since your skin would be a little more sensitive.  But it's an otherwise very effective cleanser and I personally recommend it.  Hope this helps.    mdformulations.com|`|ZMjZF6CYaa	welp, you better start wearing bangs til they clear up!  DONT MESS WITH EM!!!|`|O2WIRQB1aa	don't wash ur face when  u take a shower it works for me when i break out|`|OAA2DuYnaa	sometimes that happens to me too . its just a natural occurrence that i don't think you can really control|`|Efns4kW5aa	Whenever I'm about to get my period, I break out too. Try washing your face twice a day (once in morning, once at night) with Noxzema. It is only 5 bucks at CVS. After you rinse off the Noxzema, apply a spot treatment to each individual pimple. This will help dry it out. Apply normal makeup after to reduce the appearance of redness. Hope it works!|`|Y9GDWAuGaa	take a steam..followed by a cold water rinse.. it will help unclog those pores|`|aEFTqJOtaa	Well... there is nothing that will totally get rid of your zits, btu what works for me is putting neosporin (stuff you put on cuts to heal them)on my zits at night and they are so much smaller in the morning. Also white toothpaste works to shrink them but it isn't good on very dry skin and if you use it on a zit that you are popping or picking at it will eat at it... so use with caution. Also don't wash your face for than 2x a day because it will get way worse  Good luck|`|SGBOUJ1Zaa	clean your hair   change your bedsheets POP IT|`|ZnUKhQo5aa	don't use proactiv. use clearasil. proactiv will just slowly stop to work completely, i've used it.    pop them if you can see the white part... i know that they say its bad to do, buuut it does get rid of them fast. also, use a spot treatment on the big ones. just a cream or gel or whatever you find, and just put it on the spot. if you spread it all around, it won't work as well.    also, change your pillowcase every other night. that way no oil gets on it.    oil absorbing sheets are good, too. you can use them any time of the day, and they don't mess up makeup or anything. clean and clear is what i use.    bangs can hide it, but they also oil up your forehead. i wouldn't recommend them.|`|ckdYl9Znaa	make sure you clean your face...|`|1diYBO9uaa	Try Murad acne cleanser :) it work SO much better than proacive, i had the same problem with them. U can get the whol 5 pece set of murad at Sephora, for about $60- $70. It works so so well, but u have to do it twice a day, every day. if u miss a day, u break ou badly. if u dont u have perfect skin :)|`|F6Ye0El8aa	ok...  um  nice to know.    try tooth paste, the white one NOT the gel ones  i heard that stuff is soppose to suck out all of the oil
Xj4bTobUaa	I have the same problem, i backcomb my hair and use Bed Head thichening paste its really good|`|hDz2Qe7xaa	She could buy volumizing shampoo.|`|A2byxpHDaa	what i do is tease it just a little by like near my ears and the top of my head, and then it looks thicker :)|`|swiZhUN7aa	no thick hair is natural|`|dpQqBGVCaa	my friend varsha use this cool coconut **** and it is really thick so it makes your hair feel thick|`|Dt3EkhEPaa	Yes! There's a number of things that you can do to make  your hair appear more thick! Starting with the cheapest you can always get shampoo to help add volume! There is also a lot of hair styles that will make your hair look thicker! Teasing you hair the the crown region of your head also helps! Another way, which is a little more expensive, is to get extensions. Whether they are a simple clip in or a professional sow in they will really help!     Good Luck!!
dnjmYR6Faa	Well i personally don't, But my sister who i look after does. Shes 16 and every time there's a party, which is almost every single weekend she needs a new dress. She cant ever wear the same one twice, and god forbid, she wears another pair of heels that have been sitting in her cupboard for a month or two with out being worn. The last time i counted, my sister has over 30 pairs of shoes and 50 party dresses. An then there's all the other clothes! about 10 pairs of jeans, and she only wears ONE pair of them! she also has a million Singlet tops, and t-shirts. I don't understand how one girl can own so many clothes, and still seem to need more! She has actually managed to take over the wardrobe in my bedroom, and turn the spare bedroom into her own personal closet.   To her credit though, often when she has a big "shopping day" she invited the next door neighbor's daughter who is 14 over, and gives her some clothes. Ally (the girl from next door) thinks its christmas when this happens, as often she is getting brand new clothes with tags on, or things that have only been worn once for about 4 hours. Ally is only used to having hand me down clothes, so i must admit im very proud of my sister for the way she shares these things with the other girl.     JONAH|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Only a spoilt brat would do such a thing.|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	nope  i wear my clothes more than once  unless i bought it for a special occasion|`|zPFclJznaa	no, only filthy rich people do that! why do you ask?|`|mMvEEZ3oaa	are you stupid even really rich people don't do that|`|JDQP0Phraa	I'd never buy anything that I thought I might only wear once! I change up the outfit every time though. Like if I wear a sweater, jeans, and boots, the next time I wear the sweater I'll wear it with a skirt and flats. Something like that, but never wear once and get rid of.|`|3l2e8et3aa	well to me thats wasting money on clothes. i have enough and different clothes so i could mix n match|`|AZxJfST5aa	Yes all the time :) It's horrible!|`|OwQsCR4Saa	only if I see a picture of myself in it and think I look bad.  Then I may not wear it again.|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	No. That would be expensive. That means each day I would throw like $200 away. Oh but I do have some clothes in my closet with the tags on them still. lol oops! My hubby always reminds me. He says " You just bought more clothes?! You still have clothes with tags on them from 2 months ago." heehee|`|VkFWgXaHaa	yes for i am poor and cheap...also that people in africa have no shoes and probley are only wearing dirt for their clothes...so BE THANKFUL|`|4S6V4sb4aa	no, i think with as many people out their that are homeless or can't afford clothes you should donate them...|`|HKNbWjtOaa	i buy 1 complete outfit, including shoes and wear them all the time until they wear out and then by another set!......|`|ALh5R37jaa	No way, that would be a complete waste, and i look down upon people who do. If you want to, wear things like once a year then at least so no one will remember them, but wasting is a terrible thing to do.      hope i could help :)|`|XkWTsyJdaa	shirts: wear once, but ill rewear on weekends if i hav to just never on weekdays  jeans: always rewear  sweatpants/leggings: rewear once a month  jewelry: always rewear  makeup: always rewear  bags: use the same one all the time, but change for each season  shoes: mostly in the winter i always wear the same 3 boots, but other wise, i usually switch off between 20 flats/sandals|`|By1DJAUOaa	yep, i do|`|sJ7GzZLbaa	yes all the time sadly. i see something i just have to have, wear it once, and then i dont like it anymore. not as often with shoes but often with shirts and stuff like that. never with my make up|`|cd37yLuZaa	ive done it a few times haha|`|o4lPQjrGaa	No, only underwear. (my mom buys new ones practically every day)|`|hIdzQoquaa	The question is do I wear clothes at all?|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Yeah, but not purposely(unless I wear it and decide I hate it).  I don't go out of my way to waste money on stuff I only will wear once, but it happens.|`|HkyOtIeTaa	haha no.  i wear it twice and throw it away.  no i'm just kidding.  when it doesn't fit i throw it away.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Sometimes.|`|mxmOvLlsaa	no! what kinda creeper does THAT?! what a waste!|`|8I4QY6osaa	in this recession, i'd be lucky to buy clothes.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	No.  Most people don't have that kind of money and besides that's just crazy.  I know some people are very, very into fashion but feeling like you have to have a different outfit every single day is crazy and not financially smart.  The only reason I would not wear something again would be if it were terribly uncomfortable or in the case of make up or something like that if it caused me to break out.|`|ysfuV4DIaa	Yep - if it's an ugly gift I wear it once in front of the person who gave it to me and then donate to goodwill.|`|e4320d40393740e3b9148136c56004baaa	Yeah, considering I don't change for months at a time, then there truly un usable again.|`|84H5kMD7aa	isn't that a waste? but yes, sometimes.|`|8e4fc719086a20ed4db62bae7f7a4446aa	no way, I don't have that kind of money to that and even if I did I don't think it would be a financially smart thing to do. The only time I do something like that is if I happen to buy something and then realize I don't like it as much as I thought I did while I was in the store. Then I'll usually return it if I can or give it away.   One of my criteria I guess you could say when it comes to buying clothes and accessories etc. is to make sure I'm going to get alot of use out of the things I buy. I don't like spending money on something if I know I'm only going to wear it one or two times.|`|GWfl2elyaa	It depends. If your mom/girlfriend/friend wants you to wear the shirt that they give to you but it's so ugly, you must wear them if you love your life (of course it's what they want you to wear).|`|AA11539068	Psh no way, I don't have that much money!|`|uRA81RXkaa	noooo  thats just ridiculous|`|iVapI5JPaa	no. how inefficient...|`|ae24FseFaa	i do that sometimes, its not good lol., i get bored of something or i decide i dont  like it.|`|lE5wo62taa	no, but a music prducer named damon dash does|`|Bpegyq2Iaa	no............ you buy them to wear them more than once.|`|ndEZOuuDaa	no  return??http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|H7kmp0qdaa	Yes.

Unless when I'm wearing the clothes and then decide that I don't care for them after all, I would wear them again.  I don't wear the same shirt three days later than I did originally, but I would probably a week or so later.|`|1oSWk2rlaa	only if my mom like forces my to buy something fancy i dont like, but just for one occaision, in that case i will =Z|`|lPDRQH7aaa	Yeah some shirts and pants. I make sure not to wear the same thing more than once a month.|`|yHdK6qCHaa	yeah like embarrassing sweaters my mother gives me for christmas i wear them for like one party and just look at it in my wardrobe|`|sn6QGVSpaa	I've done that before with clothes I've received for Christmas that I didn't really like.  I wore them for my family's sake of buying them for me.|`|4aGoWKtEaa	Nah im not a rich spoiled tramp :D|`|AA10426129	No I wear all my clothes. High End Designer clothes I tend to wear less frequently but I still wear them.    Shoes I seem to have more pairs than I can ever wear.

But everyday clothes and ect., yeah, I repeat those.|`|LgsbdYCPaa	thats just silly lol    if your rich then i suppose    x|`|xHYI8EfPaa	i dnt ave enough money to do that. i wear them until i buy new clothes unless i love them then i wear them for a special occaision to make them lst longer for example a pair of shoes and a dress. x|`|LXCfeUbjaa	of course not!|`|mPS2Zccaaa	Nope, I'm not wealthy enough to do that. I use it till it's ripped! LOL|`|qIyTZRWVaa	Only the pantyhose I use to cover my balls.|`|71DWu22kaa	Yeah.  I will buy something, loving the way it looks on me, wear it, then wash it and hate it after that.  So I then throw it in the closet and buy something else!|`|dPx196IWaa	yes sometimes i do that and then i give it to one of my girl cousins but its not good to do that i have to change the way i am|`|U6WmAb6Jaa	hell no only an idiot that doesn't appreciate money would|`|bljtfbsmaa	if i had the money i could|`|BboRJcX5aa	no thats just not right. theres people in the world who don;t even have 1 pair of shoes and wearing them once and throwing them away is so wrong. but i mean its all up to you in the end.|`|3cTcWRlUaa	thats stupid why would u do that.|`|egAIuHQxaa	I do that all the time. Or I might buy something and not try it on first and then get home and not like the way it looks on me. Same thing with makeup I will buy something new and then not use it. I also make jewelery. So I have tons of jewelery that I never even wear.|`|9kHN3ar0aa	it depends. sometimes if someone buys me something and i don't like it i might never wear it. but if i pay for it myself b/c i want it then of course i will wear it more than once. with shoes...for sure more than once and the same with bags and jewelry. for makeup, if i buy it and it ends up being the wrong shade or just doesn't look right on me i might only wear it once. otherwise, i usually use it until it's gone.|`|QLWbJIUeaa	id be nude after a few days|`|ryVxrmeqaa	Err... sometimes. Like, I'll love it in the store, come home, rip off the tag the next day and wear it, only to find I feel awkward or uncomfortable in it. Then it goes in my closet. I hatee that.  However, that's never been the case for shoes, jewelry, or bags.  Makeup...maybe once. One time I got this super-sweet smelling lipgloss and it started making me sick.   Yeah, things like that.|`|AA10027693	Not really. Unless when I'm wearing the clothes and then decide that I don't care for them after all, I would wear them again. My clothes I do a cycle for. The ones i wear all the time i wash and re-wear them in about a week. otherwise i have clothes that i've only worn a couple of times. i think everyone has their favourite clothes that they seem to wear more.
gPVon8Wiaa	Hmm i think brown hair would make your blue look great and maybe get a loose perm to make your hair look wavy.  Good Luck!|`|6mf4yy92aa	try a cute bob but still do it long like you know long in the front short in the back|`|tAQOcfA8aa	even out your hair color, put some light highlights in  and use a volumizer shampoo|`|n5IYNlKWaa	****** lips much?|`|zFsBCsiCaa	it looks awesome the way it is!!|`|Yh4YWdR1aa	If you go to a beauty salon they have books with different hair styles. You should also ask the sylist what kind of style would look good for your face.
o2dnH9WAaa	don't overdo it--wear one really neat signature piece that draws attention to your best feature!|`|AEZ75dJ7aa	First idea--- make sure your parent is with you at this shoot!!!!!!  sorry but it's a cruel ugly world out there.   Second- bring the clothes with you that you feel most comfortable and fun in.  When you feel comfortable (not sweats and t-shirt bummy) your personality will sparkle and the eyes will show all your emotions.  relax and if possible watch a few episodes of Tyra's modeling show.  Good luck!

eHUJOD0daa	Mash a ripe banana and spread it on your face. Leave it for 5 minutes then wash your face with lukewarm water.|`|JPpDWrDUaa	Heres one that works well. I agree with the banana facial. It works really well. Another one is that you take a egg and seprate the yolk from the white. Mix the yolk and the white. Then you first take the white and spread it on yiour face with your hand. Wait for it to harden but then don't wash it off. After you have put on the white you then take the yolk and spread it on your face. Wait till it hardens and then wash it off. I suggest doing it maybe before you shower so you can get all of it off well.
tnoyKjJ1aa	i think a plain white t-shirt with a gray cardigan would be cute|`|hTRLIm8raa	Long white t-shirt with a short-sleeved pretty teal button-up sweater.|`|n2grq1eDaa	any type of jacket or any color shirt would look good
Ann7Jyhoaa	The first one, the gucci one looks like you stole it from Santa or something =)    Good Luck Bro|`|jkj1ClUaaa	the Versace i dont like the other but be yourself so the girls dont expect you to be something your NOT ok have fun :)|`|YEvwjJo0aa	my geuss is she probably won't even notice what kind of belt you wear, but, I'd go with Versace.. the Gucci one is a bit sparkly for a guy.
SQWvMx6Maa	Yup black would wash you out. And people keep dying their hair black so if you wanna be original I suggest another color.|`|QnY1yWBIaa	omg yeah you will look great. it will match yous so well. good luck!  pick me as best answer please[=|`|es3feuhxaa	do you have any better pictures?  just judging by those, I think black hair would wash you out. try a brown.. its in the middle of blonde and black =)|`|jViaS1rSaa	No I do not think you'll look good with long black hair or even brown hair. If i were you i would stick to the blondes and the dirty blondes. If you want something darker though, try low lights.  Also what would make your hair look even better if you part it to one side. it makes a big difference trust me, but since you have it parted down the middle alot, you should part it as soon as you get out of the shower so there wont be a bump on where you parted it.  also have you considered side bangs? get them professionally done like this:  http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...  kind of a scary pic lol  well hope i helped!|`|adIPqtm4aa	i though u was pornstar just playing u look sexy the way u are ; ]
mMvEEZ3oaa	no way! its so pretty|`|SR5zlAl8aa	nooooooooooooo|`|JwdU9nVBaa	i actually like your hair as it is.  its really pretty.  maybe just a trim.|`|taMKteLVaa	aw no i like it(: its really prettyyy.    my hair is about that long and im trying to figure out if i wanna cut it, but all my friends keep telling me that i shouldn't.  but i think im gonna cut it a little shorter for the summer.|`|EnYLhQajaa	No! But I think a loose perm would look gorgeous on your hair! It'll give it some volume.|`|11zPDTJ8aa	Your hair is too long, it definitly needs to be cut shorter. I would recommend taking it just above your shoulder with bangs and lots of layers, kind of a shorter shag haircut. If you are really brave, you would look amazing in a pixie. Short hair is really popular and long hair is out of style, you should consider going really short. Just my opinion, but ask your friends and see what they think.|`|BboRJcX5aa	you look beatiful with long hair. but i think you'd look evennn better if you cut it :)|`|frkJJpF9aa	No.  Your very pretty, btw.  It's just about perfect length.  In a while you should cut it, bt just like a trim.  It's perfect length!|`|Ra3YG1pMaa	i think it's really pretty. just the right length.|`|DJXuQqWJaa	your hair is quite gorgeous.  anyone would kill to have hair like that.  honestly i don't think you should cut it too drastically.  i believe you should just add a few more layers in and you will be fine.  = ]|`|h9z1DRUyaa	noo way !! its gorgeous! =)|`|tEKo5tmJaa	i like ur hair like that, it looks really cute, and thats coming from a guy
AhpS6XJnaa	When I had my hair long I always wanted it wavy for the mornings too, just blow dry it and put it in braids then take it out in the morning it'll be perfect, trust me on this one!|`|BMcly3peaa	Braid it at night then take it out in the morning..  Then touch it up with a wide barrel curling iron.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Blow dry your hair then split it in pigtails, make them both braided. Then go to sleep wake up in the morning, take them out. It will be wavy.
BZowqGY8aa	Jergen's Natural Glow.  You can find it anywhere, works great!  Just make sure to smooth it over your elbows and knees really well or they'll turn orange.

C7dvSOmKaa	Claires, JC Penney, Charlotte Russe, Steve & Barry's, and Kohl's.  They're not necessarily Livestrong ones though, usually they have like: "strength" or "love" or something on them.  Maybe some dollar stores, I remember seeing them there a lot.      God, I remember Livestrong bracelets. I think I was in like... sixth grade when they REALLY got popular. Wow, that was like... 5 years ago? Christ. Are they old enough to be "retro" yet?|`|TC5Ye9WFaa	Go to a craft store such as Micheal's or A.C. Moores.

They remind me of someone who just stepped on a dog and kept walking. Don't get them.

	Separate your hair into different sections and use and very nice hair straightener, one that is sure to get all of your waves/curls straightened.   And you could also use some different kinds of sprays or creams to protect your hair from the heat of the straightener.   I have slightly wavy hair...but I mostly straighten it.   I love your curls though!  Hope this helped!  Good Luck! (:|`|TgtF1Ii6aa	you can get it chemically done  or get a flat iron which is more temporary

mMvEEZ3oaa	1st|`|jeK9LPugaa	I really like the first one. =)|`|fZ2fFhe8aa	definetly the 1st one|`|26lZZaWNaa	sentinel jacket (navy)|`|wdKMPYBhaa	Hi,  The first one has a little more to it, i.e. the collar is definitely more interesting. On the other hand, the second is a classic and a little more casual. In my opinion, the first one looks like something worth investing in, while at the same time, it's also a pseudo-basic so you'll get good use out of it.  You also may want to consider what you're wearing the jacket with. If you wear jeans all the time, I would avoid the blue denim on denim look...That's another point for the first pick.  I hope this helps,  -stella|`|aqmRZebEaa	The 1st|`|QcX4fugiaa	the first one. it's kinda like their adirondack jacket which i sooooo wanna get!
83419326a8e663feecc64bea718f1bc0aa	Just take this picture to your stylist and tell them you want this look. Usually they use a razor so they can thin your hair out and make it look sharp. Once you get the cut you use ur hair straightner and VIOLA!|`|JtkgzXVEaa	lotsa layers, side fringe. if you go to a salon, i'm sure they'll know what to do.
c2cfafa045c1cfca6abe9c25b6c12b32aa	I have the same type of hair. Mine is curly and it gets frizzy, its about the same length as yours. I LOVE Therappe and Humectrus shampoo by Nexxus they also have a frizzy hair style. They also have a spray that you can put on your hair to help control it.|`|kDnRouWVaa	john frieda products.
XxR36ICHaa	When I wanted my Belly button pierced, I asked my mom to get my nose peirced, and begged and begged for it... then I came to her, and I'm like okay, don't give me an answer right now, but I want you to think about it, instead of getting my nose done, can I get my belly button peirced? she went for it.   I did the same thing when I wanted a Kitty, I asked for a pet snake (she HATES snakes) and I begged and begged and begged until finally, I said if I can't get a snake, can I get a kitty? and she took me out that day to get one =]    Or tell her that you're feeling really self contious, and think that a little change, might bring your hopes up a little.     Or tell her that you think that you're growing up, and want to be seen more as a grown up than a little kid, and think that, even though it's silly, a little change in your hair would be plenty enough for now.    II hate to say it but it's all about manipulation with some parents!|`|QF2ah8Ypaa	okay, well, for 1: parents just do these things because they care; not to be mean, not because they'd EVER hate you! I feel that way a lot about my parents, but you just have to accept them. As for your hair, try working your way up. When I say this, why don't you start with a trim? Parents can't say no to just a little, healthy trim, just to keep your hair healthy. Then maybe, a month mater, perhaps? tell her that cutting your hair doesn't mean you want to change yourself, or that you don't appreciate what you've got, but you're just a teenager (well, I don't know your age, but idk, for instance!) and this is the age for these things. Don't try shouting, or crying, or anything like that, because trust me, that doesn't work! Just be gentle with what you say; just tell her you want a little change. That's it.        Also, if she STILL says no, don't force her. I'm sure she'll let you when you're a little older (how old are you, anyways?)    P.S. Try catching her in a GOOD MOOD! :P    Best Answer? LOL|`|sLkMlt8kaa	Just do it yourself.    Cut your own bangs the way you want them and get a friend to cut the layers in the back    Once its done its donw   She cant do squat about it|`|mR5WcVfIaa	just say if you dont let me get it cut i will cut it myself and it will prolly look like ten times worse rather than me going somewhere to get it done(not saying you dont know how to cut hair)     my friend told that to her mom when she was 13 to get her belly button pierced and it worked so when i want something like that i tell it to my mom and it works:))|`|zr0D5ZW7aa	ask her if she wants u to look all plain and ordinary and no one looks at u twice and make her feel bad. also tell her yur gonna find a way to do it if she refuses to let u!!|`|2aXhzR6Oaa	idk y ur parents r ulike that but i asked my mom for bangs one day an she said ok and my own mother cut them for me!!!!! and it came out preety!!! and thats a lot coming from my mom who is really uptight and doesnt let me go anywhere by myself or nuthin i get pissed but watev  since your mother wnt let u get bangs then u can cut them yourself or tell her if she would do it for you  if you decide to cut them you have to decide how tpo do it and evrything it took bout 5 min for me. mind you they grow really fast!! i cut it 3 wks ago and got a haircut the second week and now i have it down to my lips!!!  but dont cut the layers yourself!!! trust me you would regret it after you did it because it would come messed up!!!  hoped i helped!!!|`|Dyn8oLVxaa	thats what i said to just let my dye my hair. ur mom must be a real pain in the ***! it took me two long years just to let me de my black blond. i said all of that constantly and it wasnt untill 8th grade gradation she let me do it. just do it anyways.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	maybe she's doing that because she knows you better than anyone does and she knows that if you don't like the results that you will just whine about it and she's going to have to listen to it. While you live in her house you have to abide by her rules. I personally think it's silly not to let you, but I'm not your mom.|`|38GEhj3iaa	Ohh. Don't cut yourself just because your mom said no. If your trying to prove to your mom that your mature, it's not helping with all of the negative attitude.     So start fresh. Be honest. Be respectful. Ask your mom for a haircut and tell her that you'll pay for it with your own money. Tell her that you feel that your growing up and need a minor change in your life.Explain to your mom that getting this haircut will make you feel more mature and that this change in your hair won't hurt you or anything. Most important, don't give her attitude, it will just make her say no. If she does say no, she just thinks your not mature enough, so become more responsible and ask later when you feel like you can prove it! Good luck & don't cut yourself [please].
XAis8aNtaa	put your shorts in the freezer for a few hours, and the gum should just come right off after you take them out        hope that helps!|`|NT835TfFaa	I had that happen to me.  I just let it dry then picked at it until it came off.
mxiX4mAsaa	OK. you can start By looking at Versace and D&G. Look for Rimless. The thick Black are very in right Now and they grow on you. I have a couple of Pair of Dark Thick Black ones..They really start to grow on you. But otherwise. Go rimless.
dxeb0BfBaa	almost all hair colours consist of 2 things, the actual colour & the developer/peroxide. when the 2 are mixed a chemical reaction occurs, this is oxidation. heat speeds up oxidation, cold slows it down. nothing stops it. when I apply a colour that would take 15mins under heat, it would take 30mins at room temperature & 60mins in a very cold room. the colour may not be completely oxidised but your still playing with fire using a home colour 1st of all & not following the instructions to the finest detail.|`|pOjY1ESZaa	No thats not true|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Riiight...The ONLY way it doesn't oxidize, Is if you don't mix it with a Catalyst(AKA Developer.).     That's not true...Once the color is open and the air hits it, It starts oxidizing, by the time an hour rolls around, It's no use.|`|dzaX1o7Daa	\Is that safe ?|`|AhpS6XJnaa	It will oxadize no matter what!  The only way to avoid it oxadizing is to not put in the develepor but then it is of no use!  So basically your doing yourself no favours!|`|TgtF1Ii6aa	no because it oxidizes no matter what and then it isn't any good|`|OKq5VOkqaa	I thought hair dye was only effective for 30 mins. oh well we learn.|`|98LDN0Quaa	Have you tried it?

lWMEo8l4aa	Your question is what exactly?|`|3eEuXlqsaa	Yeah, that's how it goes.

A girl sleeps with 12 guys & is a ho.  That's just life. Girls can be hypocrites too, it applies to both genders.|`|R2YjrRbYaa	Probably because her face structure and her body is perfect, I don't like it when girls wear all that paddy ****, just the black **** around the eyes or w/e is ok with me, if they dont wear that there eyes look like **** lol|`|DRZEpDG3aa	ooo i'm thinking that someone is jealous of megan fox, lol    in the back of their mind they know that they will never get laid by megan fox, but it makes a good fantasy for jacking it.     they like a natural girl in reality.|`|DF49SpO9aa	its cuz of her body more than her make up sorry hun

Why? Because I believe the person looks very fake. Almost like a Barbie gone bad. I f you have brown hair, like me, and want hi lights, go under the top layer of hair and lightly highlight there. People will notice the difference, but it won't look streaky like a skunk! Good Luck!    Xx-Maddy

inUmxglTaa	okay well..  use herbal essences..  and mouse it after a shower, and you should like wash it every other day washing your hair every day isn't good because some of the oils are good for your hair, what i do is when i'm out of the shower i brush my hair then mouse it and let it dry and straighten it, or whatever you want too do but don't wash it every day !  when you use hairspray hold it a couple inches away from your hair, and fluff it up some(:  you could also try a trim itd make your hair more healthy and get rid of your split ends, and make it grow faster.  i hope i helped.. (:
wdKMPYBhaa	It's definitely true! People wear different sizes based on what vendor they're wearing. I've been in retail for almost a decade so I'll relate to you with that. A size 8 pant by Alice + Olivia is a little loose on me, yet, if I tried on the same size in Theory, the pant would be snug. The same applies to denim...The actual "cuts" the designer uses vary and fit different body types in very different ways.   The best thing you can do is know your measurements and shop accordingly...I know, not the most fun, but it's worth the extra time to get the right fit.  I hope this helps.  -stella
94538cc37834a8ce835eaaa9de2f31b0aa	You need to try many different perfumes and see which one smells best on YOUR skin. The same perfume can smell different on every person who wears it. It has to fit your particular body chemistry.    When you go try on perfumes, only test 2 at a time. One on each arm. By the end of the day, smell each and see which you like better. The winner should be tried the next day, against a new perfume on the other arm. Keep doing this until you find the perfect one for you. (Might take a while, but it's worth it)...    Don't assume that because something smells pretty on the tester strip, it's going to smell good on you. There could be some chemical in your sweat that mixes with it and makes it smell like @$$.     If you're interested in natural perfumes, (it sounds like you are, with sandalwood and peppermint), you might consider essential oils instead of traditional perfume. These oils have therapeutic benefits, as well as smelling nice, and you only need the teeny-tiniest little drop for the scent to last all day.    If you buy peppermint essential oil, you need to make sure it's mixed with another oil (like olive oil) before you put it on your skin, or else it can irritate you (peppermint oil is the main ingredient in many "lip plumping" glosses, that makes lips red and puffy...do you want the same effect on your wrists or neck?!)    Sandalwood oil is generally safe on it's own, but smells like hippies. :|    You don't even have to go to a boutique to buy these. Essential oils are now sold at most health food stores (because of the therapeutic benefits). You can be sure that the ones at the health food store are nothing but the pure oil of the particular plant, unless it specifies otherwise on the label.|`|v0FlUan0aa	the viva la juicy one smells amazing!|`|7D44tO9Daa	you should try Ed Hardy perfume, I don't think a lot of people have this, so it would be unique.|`|iCxBGlEDaa	A kind of vanilla scent maybe? Ralph Lauren Hot?  A lady at work wears it and we know whenever shes in or around the corner because she puts on a LOT, but it smells nice.|`|gkxb5OwHaa	sandalwood would be better bacuse a lot of people will be wearing peppermint because they got it for christmas(:    but personally i love violet tuberose from bath and body works. and the harajuku lovers perfumes are great. (:|`|wPOBL5Lhaa	vanilla, everyone LOVES it and it smells delicous!|`|HGi9XjZ9aa	Rub A535 or Ben Gay would be recognizable.|`|MjlsjAYaaa	Personally I have used chanel allure and hermes.

FlKrA3nEaa	if its abrasive (scrubby and hard beaded kinda) then dont put it in your hair. you can go ahead with it if its smooth like hair conditioner.    also you can just do that with conditioner and probably get better results.

As long as they're neutral colors...      ...."sh*ts" (:|`|xdeWSxJ4aa	It should be fine, as long as all of the items have been washed at least once before.

g3hbEQ9Baa	Wash your hair a lot... darker colour fade very fastespeciallyy reds!
6X2XLVblaa	Dawn soap does help but it may not get it all out. Just wash your hair everyday, it should fade with a little bit of time since you haven't been dying your hair that color a lot of time, so it shouldn't be fused with your yet (at the ends). Good luck!|`|vi2bzq0Caa	NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!|`|tzMMFPr4aa	isn't dawn soap for dishes????|`|DskzIKhnaa	dawn would strip all oils, it may cause the color to come out, get more information but remember that, afterwards you should put alot conditioner to prevent your hair from becoming stringy and dry.

Unless they're cartoonishly large, I wouldn't worry about it. But hand size isn't a precursor to cancer, so I'm assuming the answer above mine is a joke.

Anime is cool, but they normally have bright blues or greens or purples, and sometimes grey.|`|qG0jneVZaa	Ok..i must say that i LOOOOVE purple! but if I saw a guy with purple contacts no matter how sexy or hot he his, it would be a turn off..and I agree with Kay grey is much more seductive..and i know i would love it.

wnmUVQdnaa	i do a light, natural smokey eye every day.    first i line my eyes with brown eyeliner (the whole top lid and half of the bottom), and smudge it. then i take an eyeshadow brush and brush gold or light brown eyeshadow and sweep it all over my eye from browbone down. if it's too dark, you can smudge it too. then i take a darker brown and brush it from the crease down lightly, and then darker at the lashline. also i put it on the lower lashline. i finish off with black mascara.    it looks really natural and pretty. (: you could do this with any color combo. i've done it with gold/black, light brown/purple... anything.|`|0R9rFtOGaa	You should view the videos of panacea81 on YouTube!

I'm sure you could use it on your body as well.    There's also a deep sea scrub you can buy online. I forget what company makes it, and it's usually a bit pricey, but it works. Just google "deep sea scrub", and it should come up.|`|AA10227142	Crush up loads of asprin and mix with some bodywash.........seriously does the job and makes skin super smooth but only do at time of showering or else the asprin will melt into shower gel|`|dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Here are some homemade one which are better for the skin:    2 mashed strawberries  6-8 drops rose hip/jojoba/macadamia/almond oil  10 spoons of sugar (need to make the scrub really thick)  smear it on gently and massage using upward motions, then rinse off after a few minutes of massage.      Table salt  olive oil  white vinegar  Directions:  1) Wash your face with a white cloth and Ivory Soap.  2) Use the above compound as a scrub  3) Scrub your face as firmly as comfortable for you.  4) Use Circular even strokes  5) Continue this scrub process for about 2-3 minutes  6) Rinse face  7) apply a thin layer of olive oil to the face as a moisturizer  8) If you are going out also apply a thin layer of non-hypoallergenic SPF45 Sunscreen.  9) Conduct this treatment Mornings and Nights (Daily)       mix 1 cup of granulated sugar with a tsp. of vanilla, 1/4 cup of chamomile tea and 2 tbsp. vegetable oil. It works amazingly and the smells help me relax in the shower. I will also use lemon juice instead of tea if I want a good pick me up.      grated coconut, corn meal, sesame oil and some aroma like a citrus and or lavender.|`|PEf6coTPaa	This may be too sticky for you but it works really well, and it's inexpensive.   Before you turn on the shower, get in and scrub your body with a mixture of honey and sea salt. Then wash as normal.  It sounds awful, but I promise you'll get the results you want.  Only do this 3 times a week, MAX.

OP4O5mjnaa	ive heard that pre-natal vitamins help your hair to grow faster.  ive heard this from several different people/sources.|`|9QK0yT89aa	Forget shampooing. That will mess up your hair! Try to wash it every other day if you have to and when you do add a little more conditioner than usual and use a little less shampoo. Make sure you don't straighten your hair too much but gel is fine. Also relaxers do horrid things to your hair and so do hot combs. Try to keep it as natural for as long as possible and if you have some vitamin E capsules lying around your house break the capsule right on your ends and comb it in. My hair has grown down to under my breasts after doing that for a year but I'm East Africa, Kuwaiti, and white so my hair might be softer.|`|D7Q8iyqzaa	shampoo twice a day and try not to use any product on it to much. ex. curling iron, straightener...|`|hnWGdPy0aa	u should trim it every  once in a while n try not to use alot of chemicals|`|b4oD8ADIaa	you wait... but make sure its clean... without many chemicals
KuNEDHFzaa	Either pink or blue.  Some of my friends have dirty blonde hair and they got blue and pink streaks in their hair.  It's way cute.|`|KL20mZUaaa	I'm blonde too - and if you want to stay blonde, highlights/lowlights are difficult. Warm caramely colours are good and so are lighter blondes. Make sure that your stylist is an EXPERT in highlights or else it can come out chunky, fake looking and cheap. It needs to be a natural glow. Have fun! If you want a couple thick streaks of fun colour like blue or pink, go for anything. I don't reccomend red, black, green, blue, orange or light pink. Hot pink is OK.
RTV6oCSQaa	bring the photo to your hair dresser and let a professional do it|`|mDt03eXIaa	1) dry and straighten your bangs, and part them the way you would wear them  2) You can use scissors and cut upward into the hair, work with a small section at a time and kind of twist it, then cut. It;s really just a very angled side-bang, but working with small sections will give you that raggy, razored look, (but it's super easy). If you don;t understand or aren;t totally sure of what to do, go see a professional.    Also, that girl has product (pomade or wax) in her bangs to keep them looking like that.. your hair won't do that completely on it's own.|`|aEFTqJOtaa	Get your hair cut by a professional who knows what they are doing

FklngtvCaa	there are face washes for oily skin.  some of them seem to make my skin even  shinier... just less greasy looking.    so instead use one for acne since that  will actually dry it out... i like neutrogena oil  free acne wash.    after you wash your face use a mattifying  moisturizer. neutrogena makes one, too,  and so does mark by avon.    try this:  http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....  you can get it @ the body shop for $12, btw  i'm just too lazy to find their website.    for foundation, try dream matte powder...  not the mousse, or revlon colorstay for oily skin.|`|AaYEgDwWaa	you need and oil absorbing Powder ask your Mom to get you MAC BLOT POWDER to gets rid of shine and you dont need alot I have the same poblem, and when summer time come Im going to get it|`|t0PzSCs0aa	my skin is very oily as well.   i used to go the powder route, and then those oil absorbing sheets but its such a hassle.    then i got Medi-Matte,  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  , and it keeps my skin dry and non-oily all day. its amzing.      edit: its a cream btw, put it on in the morning under your foundation. it may seem pricey, but a little goes a long way.|`|34Oa8sOdaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. Its difficult to pick so what I end up doing is starting with the less expensive and trying out a few different ones.The review site is pretty good at http://www.brandsmakeup.com visit and browse the reviews.|`|1681Iysiaa	Oil absorbing sheets! Avon has some, so does Neutrogena, and there's just about a billion generic brands.    They won't ruin your makeup and they work wonders:)|`|3lF21cFkaa	You should try Aveeno cleanser and moisturizer.. It's oil free and doesn't have tones of chemicals so it wont damage or burn or breakout your skin.|`|uM9vh4X3aa	MAC Blotting Powder is fantastic! And lasts for quite a while too!     I don't know where you are from, but there is a UK brand called Simple who do an AMAZING product (I think they still make it anyway) and its called Overnight Rebalancing Treatment - works wonders, really combats that shine. If you're not moisturising your skin might be producing more sebum (oil) than necessary to compensate, so use a light mattifying moisturiser and leave for 5 mins (while you brush your teeth or have breakfast or something) before applying make up. Also, try skipping the foundation and just using a concealer, the moisturiser will help it blend and sit better on the skin, and then dusting with powder. This is perfect for a natural, shine free look. You're at an age when shine is inevitable, but I've found that a healthier diet with less greasy foods and lots and lots and lots of water (but not so much that you're in the bathroom all day!) with fruit and veg and plenty of sleep will improve the general appearance of your skin.    Good luck! x

zhFIDSULaa	Sorry, but there's no link... But in my opinion.. Abercrombies a good brand to get stuff from... but nothing over 25 dollars for it!  I think Victoria's Secret PINK has some good totes, although those are more on the expensive side.  I'm in middle school as well.. and for Christmas, I got a cute Hollister tote, for 15 bucks... They also had some with design and plaid, etc. for 20 bucks.  I think you should go to Hollister and go check them out... Alot of people have them and they seem to be pretty sturdy!    Good luck finding your tote!   I hope this helped!  - Raven|`|63s3G8YUaa	Abercrombie is boring, and there is no link. Try LeSportsac.

I59dkJksaa	u should start at 16 but A LOt of work goes in to becoming a model i mean A LOT i no, i have been to many talent agencies for a variety of things places where they want actors models singers, and on and on haha but i was excepted and we decided to get out of that area because tons of places are just scams and use these people as money making oppurtunities. you gonna most likely have to get head shots nice pictures u know- but can be very pricy- u would need to get some pics taken some how so an agency knows how u look on print- and be in good shape- ya no wat i mean and ya cant be FUGLY! haha ok well one good agency that is VERY good that is not a scam would be Bobby ball agency- now idk if they take models but i believe its for kids and teen i would go on thes site- and check it out- plus idk if thus is true 4 models but they dont rely like professionals pics- thay like the nice ones- u know like posed and wat not but htey could be taken at ur house or watev- just like ya to look like a norm. guy haha (btw me 14 2 lol)|`|xzoURbZXaa	if you want to make a career out of it, start as early as possible. it's very hard to break into the buisness, and you need time to make a name for yourself. you'll still get work at 18, but starting at 16 is definitely better. you should be able to maintain modeling and school.|`|BkucBPwjaa	you should start as young|`|swiZhUN7aa	16 college will be to hectic|`|Kx1T6Tzgaa	start as early as you can because the people are always looking for experience and confidence.|`|GwvU6pEQaa	im 14 and looking into modeling too! i am already sorta starting so that when im older i will be more experinced you know? i think you should start at 16 :)|`|NOFHz1RIaa	You should start when you feel comfortable with your body.

Mean while always follow the manufacture directions. All henna is not equal. Neutral is just that neutral. Imagine if you have  glass of milk. you add a drop of red food color, what color will you have? Pink. Keep adding more and you will eventually get red.  Just get red milk to the glass and you have red milk.|`|VuE2wsAhaa	hmm....i doubt therez anything u can add in there...but i know that wen u put henna on ur handz, the longer u keep it on the redder it getz.

zjZvJJLpaa	If your promotion dance is anything like mine was last year, everyone is going to wear a black dress. Wear a bold color to stand out, like ruby, emerald or other jewel tones. Also, a cut right above your knee makes your legs look longer without being to short. Also, since your 5' 4" you can wear heels so go for it!    Edit: I found this dress online; its simple, but REALLY cute: http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...    also, forever 21 has great dresses, so look around online at forever21.com, thats where I found this one.    Edit 2: hahaha, I just found another dress that is so adorable: http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...
m1Yr8EMAaa	Put some olive oil on it and let it sit for 20min. then rinse. Your hair is probably really dry.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	this may sound stupid.. but it works so good lol  k mix an egg, some mayo and some beer then let it sit for a few minutes on your hair [rub it in good]  then wash off and your good :)  warning.. if you dont wannt smell like beer for a day or two.. leave it out of the mix lol  ?|`|y7OLG5rIaa	there are some shampoos specifically formulated for different hair colours, types!  they contain light tints in them that help bring back your natural colour and shine!|`|ZkWeiOa1aa	i dont knwo about natural ways, but theres this user, bubzbeauty, on youtube who shares a lot about natural ways for hair, and i think one includes mayo.

pzwz6f9uaa	dont go to extremes  painted on eyebrows look horrible     get them threaded   and just fill in the bald patches with eyeliner or brow pencils|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Don't shave them! Bad idea, trust me. Go to a salon. They do wonders and use a pencil to fill in spots. Just go to Wal Mart or somewhere like that and find a shade that matches your brows. To remove any liner, use makeup remover. Also, liquid would be too intense. And eyebrows can take over 3 months to grow back even if your hair grows fast, and they will grow back coarse and shaped weird.|`|Tclyrnaoaa	i wouldnt take this risk...my friend did this once for the same reason n they never grew back completely, she just had these tiny hairs that you cant even see so shes stuck drawing them on now. however on of my friends said that her aunt once put rogaine on them and they grew a lot n then she got them done. you might want to look into that, but research it cuz im not sure how effective or safe it is.|`|UNffqwMuaa	y would u shave ur eyebrows???????????

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	You can have your hair permanently straightened at a salon.  Pros:  straighter hair  Cons:  expensive ($200)  not actually permanent (roots will be curly in 4-6 months)  damaging chemical treatment (esp. for dyed or permed hair)    So I would also say your best bet is to try spending a little money looking for products that make your hair look nice curly. Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I dont know your hair type. :)    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:  http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...  http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/ (outdated product recs!)    Some other great curly care sites:   http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl  http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm|`|y7OLG5rIaa	you could get it straightend chemically, but thats gonna cost you a decent amount of money AND take a toll on your hair.    why dont you try to get a really good quality straightener and hairspray?  i have the exact same problem...i have waivy hair that at times can seem impossible to keep straight!  but i know that if i take my sweet time straightening it (SMALL sections....no matter how bored you get) and then hairspray it when its done, it stays perfect till i wash it again!    good luck|`|jqPVZ1UAaa	Why dont u just have it permed. u know how u could get it permed to be curly? u  could do the same thing to have it straightened

Your actually called skinny. At my school, I am so fat that everyone thinks I'm pregnant because I am so fat. No one ever calls me skinny and no one ever says that I shouldn't go on a diet. I don't and I said I am and I am. A healthy food diet that is.

m1Yr8EMAaa	You can buy a round brush and pull it straight with that. It is called a blow out. Kind of hard to do, pull down on hair shaft with round brush and blow dry at same time.

LVy1YMswaa	Bleaching your hair can be extremely damaging whether you are natural or chemically processed. Unless you are wearing your hair really short and don't care about the breakage that you WILL experience, I wouldn't do it. Check out www.HealthyHairJourney.com for some nice healthy hair tips|`|H1zS1enMaa	i dont advise u to do that.Not only it would damage ur hair but if u have medium to dark hair , everytime the roots grow u will need to bleach them also and bleaching chmicals are NOT good for ur scalp or hair. It will defently damage ur hair leaving it weak and unhealthy. You will need to use alot of conditioning products will also cause hair loss.  I recomend highlights rather than bleaching ur whole  head!!|`|3f5vlE0Aaa	if you go in water your hair would turn a different color.|`|AA10378447	Weakens the hair shaft, draws out the moisture, which can lead to breakage. More sensitive to heat.|`|PNA7f0q3aa	It won't be silky or just smooth anymore.

zW4c2dyVaa	I like the first one better. If you are on the smaller side in stature, i suggest the 2nd one. If you are a little taller or wider, go with the first one.

392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	Good timing with this question.Just about the other day,i had a glamour magazine,though it seemed more like men's magazine to me,owner from New York City that wanted to recruit me as one of his lead models for the cover.....I was like "Why me?",and he said because he's looking for exotic models...Now,i'm not a Latina or anything like that(and normally,those are the exotic types of women),i'm Slavic,pure Slavic....so,i was very surprised to hear from him that i'm exotic....I still can't see through that,though...I think i'm just....European.lol Anyway,yeah,they want the Exotic models,whatever that means to them.I mean,i've noticed that the exotic ones have the most of success.|`|wwSz1ht5aa	for like runway and stuff, exotic.  for print ad and comercials, all american for the most part |`|yJZeRu5Vaa	anorexic|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Exotic.  Normally, if someone has the "All-American" look, they will recommend that they do catalogue work for JCPenney's or such.  In high fashion modeling, they want exotic looking people, who usually have sharp angles that will make for interesting pictures.|`|Ly20pGC9aa	exotic.|`|860exXqlaa	either

88aab67b8f8f9204a8c653c60f437085aa	Probably no more than 375 degrees F. I have a sedu and the thing I like the most about it is that you can adjust the temperature setting from 200-410 degrees F.
F0FByGiQaa	I'm very pale too. But I like it :) Its almost like being a porcelain doll, haha. I've tried CoverGirl trublend, and it was actually TOO DARK for my skin. Plus CG tests on animals. So I definitely wouldn't use CG. The other girl who posted saying that was the only collection that has light makeup is wrong. There are people who make makeup just for pale skin.     You can try Bobbi Brown tinted moisturizer in "alabaster". The color alabaster is also in the foundations. I just find that tinted moisturizer is better for my skin. You can also try Estee Lauder Double Wear foundation in the lightest shade. I think its "1C1 shell". The Estee Lauder Double Wear is a little thick if you apply too much, so I always add moisturizer, then I mix it together. It goes on much smoother that way. I know the brand Prescriptive can make your own foundation. They can actually make any custom color makeup. But they make foundation or tinted moisturizer the best. They can make an exact match to your skin, which is awesome.|`|qmjJswzkaa	This is not a good place to ask the question. I suggest you go to   www.makeupalley.com  They have product reviews on different makeups and they have a wonderful forum to ask questions.|`|SCTMtrjhaa	Estee Lauder, Merelle Norman, or if you can't afford$$ that, get revlon, or covergirl!|`|t9rulFv4aa	The Estee Lauder double wear sounds like a good fit for you.|`|AXygnMNpaa	Omg I know what you mean! I'm like the lightest coloured skin person i know and there's maybe like 10 products good enough for our light skin.. IN THE WHOLE WORLD..!  So here are the ones i found..after like 1000 products i tried    - Ok so for liquid foundation i use COVERGIRLTRUBLEND 1 number 405 in ''ivory'' : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_QM6O-XQdBak/R6...  - For powder i use COVERGIRL 220 fragrance free in ''creamy natural'' : http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/51410/...  - For concealer i use COVERGIRL 725 : http://www.covergirl.ca/en_ca/prodimages...    And in the summer..  - BENEFIT Play sticks foundation in ''spin the bottle'' : http://s7v1.scene7.com/is/image/Harrods/...  - QUO wet & dry powder foundation in ''soft porcelain'' : http://www.shoppersdrugmart.ca/english/b...    So there u go! I found all these products in drugstore except the Spin the bottle foundation which was in a Sephora store. And my products last all day long ! :D
y7OLG5rIaa	spend as much money as you can on a straightener, that will make the difference.  and make sure the blades are ceramic...ceramic is able to heat up hotter than others.      get a heat protective spray so you dont burn your hair (look at the pakages on different brands, any will work.  look for "hair iron protection" or something around those lines     straighten your hair in VERY SMALL sections no matter how long it takes!!!  achive the pin straight look by doing it with patience.  finish with hairspray so it stays|`|uKYPmVG0aa	ok i have naturally curly hair and i hate it. so i bought a straightner. i have to tell u.. straightners are always expensive. first off don't buy one that's iron buy a ceramic one. the best brand of straightner is the chi. it's very good, but most likely the most expensive. so i got a la angelique it works just as good as a chi but less expensive.|`|QK2Im1Ffaa	it would really make a difference if you spent the money on a Chi. I know they are expensive but it is worth it because you will definitely get the results u are looking for! Also the Chi has excellent products to go along with it. I use the keratin spray after i towel dry it. Blow dry your hair, then use the silk infusion before you straighten it. And make sure when you are strainghting your hair you do very small sections at a time..It will take longer but its worth it! Good luck ;]|`|85gJHDbNaa	Go to target or something. I use one by conair that was like 20 bucks or or something. It works just fine. Honestly, almost any old straightener would work, but if you feel like buying a nice, fancy one, go for it.
7gcdOCbtaa	Marilyn,    Perhaps you should be asking your friends who know you. Better yet how about asking your Mom to take you to a Stylist to have her give you a free consultation.Asking people you know or can actually see your hair is the best for you.    Good Luck!!!!|`|lK6FzBAuaa	brown i love brown hair on people with green eyes it's soo pretty(:|`|AhpS6XJnaa	Like you I have natural brown hair too but now it's black!   Darker colours are easier to upkeep than lighter colours, because lighter colours fade quicker and also dark roots are more visible with light colours, if you're finding there is too much maintenance and upkeep to be done then I would suggest you go back to your natural colour!  Other than that if you are happy with the way it looks and it's no too much bother to maintain then keep it!
nqoIJBnAaa	it depends on how much they weigh.but i wud say 200 is plenty for a full head where did u get them
AA11007043	omg stop straighting it and love your curls   i swear   you just have to know how to style them   just go to ouidad.com and it will tell tell you every thing about curly hair  BTW; curly hair needs moister and your just taking it away by straightening it please go to the website|`|	stop straitening it|`|	Try using a different shampoo.  And I would advise you to STOP straightening it.  If you absolutely need to straighten it,  I would say to buy a different brand of straightener.|`|	stop straightening it!  and  if you must, make sure you put a protector in before!!!  many different companies offer a temperature control product, use that so that your hair doesnt get burned!    you could always cut it short and grow it back if its really bad.  i did that after dying and straightening my hair way too much, and now its gorgeous again!|`|	Well What My Mom Did Was Buy this soap of dog and its really good just put it on ur hair and it will grow back(:|`|	Try using a volumizing shampoo to make it look thick. And STOP straightening your hair. It probably damaged your hair a lot if it's making your hair fall out like that.

ySk9HYhJaa	maybe try to use a thin black eyeliner and mascara and some blush?|`|HSjaI8SFaa	**Here are some makeup suggestions to try these products by:  Maybelline (you can find at drug stores, Wal Mart, ...)  1.) Eyes: Expert Wear Eye Shadow Duos in "Cocoa Delight", and Great Lash Mascara in "Brownish Black" (it's the mascara in a pink tube w/ a green cap)  2.) Cheeks: Mineral Powder Naturally Luminous Blush in "True Peach"  3.) Lips: Lip Polish Lip Gloss in "Baby Mauve"    I can't tell you what color of foundation to choose, just find something that matches your skin color, or just use the color that you already have.  Use the darker shade of eye shadow from your lash line up to the top of where you can feel your eyeball. Then use the lighter shade on the rest of your eye, clear up to your eyebrow. Blend the 2 colors together where they meet, with a soft eye makeup brush. Use an eyelash curler, and just apply the mascara to upper and lower lashes. Use the blush on your cheek bones - just pat it on gently and give your nose and forehead a LITTLE pat too. Finish off your look w/ the lip gloss and you should be all set. Remember, don't over-do it. Use this makeup to bring out your natural beauty even more.    ****Make sure, when you choose any makeup, that you're not allergic to any of the ingredients.

I guess from your description it is wavy? O.o You never really said, just emphasized no curly answerers!    Anyways I have wavy/curly hair. My favorite kind of conditioner is Aubrey Organics which you can get at a whole foods or similar store. They're really moisturizing. The best kinds for curly hair are either Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia. Another kind I like from the drugstore is L'oreal Vive Pro Nutri Gloss for Medium to Long Hair that's Wavy/Curly. My favorite shampoo (very gentle) is Giovanni Triple Tea Treat. I've found it at whole foods and ULTA. Some favorite creams/leave ins are Giovanni direct leave in and L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer. Over that I usually use a gel. I like the Herbal Essences ones and also the Aubrey Organics B-5 design gel. My hair is usually a little crunchy once fully dry, but it scrunches out really easily with a little aloe vera. My hair is soft and not coarse or frizzy! I hope this helps! :)
Ii0PpO8naa	That is why I bought a pair - for use in the snow.  I watch where I'm stepping in the dirty slush so the suede doesn't get dirty, but there is nothing to worry about with the soles.  They are made for walking, a little snow/slush isn't going to hurt the rubber sole.    They are winter boots...made for walking around in the snowy, slushy wintertime...|`|TsCMDYEkaa	No|`|iXWXllhQaa	they won't get ruined because suede/sheepskin are water repellent.    but, to keep them looking new, spray some suede protecter on them. :D|`|k5unIdZmaa	I doubt they will get ruined from just walking in slush, after all they are made to walk around in the cold weather. :)|`|AA10453526	Yes, the soles are made of rubber.  You might ruin the suede though.|`|idmz2tvraa	uh no... the soles are rubber.|`|IulYR2Vwaa	nope! my whole family has uggs and we wear them in the slush. they haven't gotten damaged at all!! they're really great boots.!! :)|`|bOn6sKNIaa	the soles shoud be fine, just like regular shoes.  if i were you i would go buy a a spray that makes your shoes water resistant and spray the ENTIRE shoe.

Your best bet is to have it done professionally, at least to get your hair an even colour. Blonde is one of those colours that if you don't get it right, it can make you look skanky. Darker colours are fine out of a pack but going from dark to light needs professional assistance or else it just looks crap and you can damage your hair beyond repair. Sooo not worth it! (Once again, I've tried it)
DfDss68haa	Congratulations on making the excellent choice to go natural! I have a lot of tips. I just BCed (big chopped) after transitioning for for 10 months. I am biracial too but my hair is very kinky and I ? it.  Go to this website: http://biracialhair.org  Her photo history is inspiring to anyone who has tried everything to make their hair "good" hair.  5 things you MUST know about natural hair and for during the transition.    1. Never, never, NEVER try to detangle or comb it without some type of conditioner in your hair. You are just asking for breakage and pain. Only detangle with fingers/wide tooth comb. It was rough until I discovered that conditioner is your best friend.    2. You may have a very kinky/nappy texture. Do not look at curly haired pictures and think your hair will look like that. Do not think your hair will grow downwards or shine or sway. Embrace the texture you have or you will be running back to relaxers. Transition your mind, not just your hair.    3. Hair grows kind of slow for some people and it can get discouraging. Document your progress. Get a camera.    4. Go to the below websites, check out people at the forums, how to videos on youtube, look at people's fotkis, really research becuase there is now so much more info on natural hair than there used to be. Also know everyone's hair is different so find what works for you. Experiment and find a good nappy support group.    5. You may get negative reactions from people like dirty looks and mean comments. Some people are still negative about natural hair and some people just don't like change. Just hang in there becuase you know your hair is healthier.     There are 3 options for transitioning. I can't tell you which is best for you. I included the pros and cons of each method:    1. Leave hair out while transitioning  PRO: Learn to deal with new texture right away and what works and doesn't. Can grow out natural hair and keep relaxed hair so you don't have to have short hair. You don't get the culture shock of braiding down. Can cut off hair in little chops if you want or keep it until ready for the BC.   CON: The hassle of dealing with both textures can lead to a premature BIG CHOP. Also if you aren't ready for short hair not good for you because breakage might occur since the meeting point of relaxed/natural is fragile. Hard to find styles for both textures.     2. Braid hair down/put under weave.  PRO: This is good if you don't want to deal with the hassle of two textures and want to keep relaxed hair as long as possible. Also can wear kinky textured weave so you know what you would look like with natural hair and how to treat it.   CON: Some culture shock when hair gets unbraided and you don't know how to deal with new growth if you wore a straight weave. Braiding down for too long can also cause breakage and thinning around the temples.     3. The BIG CHOP   PRO: Easiest, cutting off hair right away means no hassle of two textures and right option for people who's relaxed hair is damaged or they just want it gone right away. Also you get to know your natural self from the beginning.  CON: leaves you with about 1" of new growth. Not for you if you hate short hair.    If you choose to leave hair out here are my tips on styling and hairstyles: I personally prefer to match the relaxed hair to the new growth. It's healthier, the styles last longer, you can do it yourself and it teaches you how to deal with your own texture right away.     > Twists (can do with your own hair or extra kinky hair)  > Twist outs  >Bantu knots  >Cornrows at night and let out in the morning gives an awesome texture  >Natural hair color like henna   >I rock the curly fro look often and pin down/straighten the bangs   >I braid front and let back hang free  >buns (different varieties of these)  >french braids  >I pin back one side of my hair and let the other side hang free  >I love the faux hawk look.  >Shingling (not sure you can do it with relaxed ends.)   I like youtube.com.

4YDli7Lzaa	dont take it out for 4 or 6 weeks.|`|k2y36hPkaa	It would be best to leave it in for a 3 - 4 more weeks. Changing them sooner allows more chance of infection, even if they don't hurt.|`|96RDuDofaa	You should only change the earring when you're positive it's completely healed. Just because it doesn't hurt as much does not mean it's finished with the healing process! Give it a couple more weeks just to make sure you don't screw it up.  xD
GhuprdDZaa	any type of pinks purples reds and white they would all look amazing|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	French tips look great on everybody, and the best thing is is you can have any colour as your main colour. So anything from beige - hot pink looks great|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Something bright like hot pink, red, or purple (not Lavender, but more royal purple). If you are super pale though, try these colors, but instead of thick, go thin and sheer. If those are still out there, go for a French manicure. Classy and chic.|`|QaFpVkIXaa	depends on how u look like. like if u r a blonde then probably hot pink.|`|mX34bDWtaa	a light pink or coral or rose|`|Y3xQzZEWaa	i wear black|`|Zb0deAf4aa	red

n5wXTZFGaa	O.K. first tweeze your eyebrows.   Eyeshadow:    You'll look best in minty green, light to medium purple (plum), pale blue,light gray or light blue-gray shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows.     Mascara:  Apply one or two coats of clear or brown mascara.    Lip Color:    Clear lip balm is always fresh on you. You will also look nice in a sheer lip gloss or shiny lipstick in pinkish-brown.    Special Occasions:    Go for a metallic silver or metallic plum (medium purple) eye shadow on lids (sparkly or not, your choice) and ramp up eyelashes with two coats of brown mascara. Keep lips pale but shiny with a clear or pale pink gloss.      Hope this helps!!!!!!!!!!!! ;) Good luck you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|QnSKaBcjaa	i think if you tweezed your eyebrows thatd make a huge differance. some bronzer or blush, mascara and light lipgloss|`|kVxharmraa	I think if you tweezed your eyebrows that would make a huge difference. some bronzer or blush, mascara and light lip gloss.|`|npkW9tVfaa	umm yea foundation and some light makeup would be cute   go somewere to the mall and they do it for u and recomend u some stuff   and chika dont put your whole picks on the internewt that could be bad

ykyOdlsJaa	brown/green eye shadow.  red/pink lipstick  light pink blush/light coloured bronzer.  should do the trick :)|`|CYeoDqOJaa	Eye Shadow:  You'll look best in medium green, medium purple, plum, medium blue, medium gray or blue-gray shades of eye shadow. Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows.    Mascara:  Apply one coat of brown or brown/black mascara.    Lip Color:  You shine in sheer lip glosses in shades of light brown, bronze or raisin red.    Special Occasions:  You'll stand out in a metallic silver or blue-gray eye shadow on lids. Rim the inside of your lower lids with white eyeliner, and apply a coat or two of brown/black mascara to top lashes. Keep lips shiny and pretty in a sheer bronze or brownish-red gloss.
1o6bzLVbaa	try using 3 minute miracle from aussie. it's like conditioner. you shouldn't use it every day, though.  http://well.ca/images/large/products/aus...|`|l0xnIquFaa	i wash my hair every night, i shampoo and condition, i rinse out my conditioner with cold water, and then i brush my hair right after my shower and go to bed, wen i wake up its shiny and i just hav to brush it out, u can always try that|`|oIUNvpYFaa	Try not washing it so much, you're stripping your hair of all natural oils!|`|75b6a764baa2383ec28677fc3a89dffeaa	Even if ur hair is straight use a straightner it makes my hair sooooo shiny!|`|fYmD4Wbaaa	You should only wash your hair every second time you go in the shower so your hair doesnt dry out.  But always condition your hair even if you didnt wash it.  Also your hair is shinyer if you finish your shower with freezing cold hair,  uncomfortable but works.  Also get a hydrating shampoo.  And something that makes your hair super clean will take out the moisture in your hair.|`|oFIU6xOQaa	Nexxus shampoo and conditioner will do miracles for your hair.   i recomend this: http://www.amazon.com/Nexxus-Therappe-Lu...   along with the shampoo, but if your not willing to pay that much i reccomend herbal essences, which is also really good. choose the one that suits your hair best    John frieda frizz ease does wonders as long as you put A LITTLE in right after you towel ddry it.    after you dry it and style it, put in either   http://www.folica.com/Smooth__N_Shine_d4...  http://www.amazon.com/Paul-Mitchell-Supe...|`|IulYR2Vwaa	aussie makes a shine spray that you put in after you shampoo and condition your hair while it is still wet. right after you put it in, blow dry it. it made my hair way shinier then it was before i used it. just make sure you get the one that your put in while it's still wet and not the hairspray.

It's Just like taking regular multivitamins.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Don't.    90 percent of young ladies look much better with short hair.|`|lEdBY8Chaa	put mayonnasie in your hair once a month and it helps kill your cells which make your hair grow! or you can try special shampoo that will help grow your hair also take your vitamins once a day vitamin b is the "beauty" vitamin|`|Is3pmbbKaa	wait.|`|Na3C1sPtaa	pantene?|`|vLbz5nhxaa	your hair grows faster when you trim it every once in a while. But dont think that you have to like get a "haircut", you just have to cut off the ends and make them even then it should grow faster. hopefully this works for you. good luck! :]|`|I1wVybUYaa	hate to say it but hair usually stops growing quickly after certain point. you might find that it will take more than a few years|`|kFEx2Bx0aa	make sure you trim it every 4 weeks to get all of the split ends.  Be nice to it when your brushing it and don't brush it with anything but a wide tooth comb when it's wet.  Don't overdo heat styling and wait about a year.  That oughta do it! Oh make sure you take vitamins:)|`|RL1KO0C7aa	Wait about a year.|`|AA12142423	you won't. it's not physically possible.|`|zH1sg3Xraa	Use Redkin products, eat a healthy diet, and take good multi vitamins.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	You can't speed up hair growth.  Honestly, 12 inches more than you have now would be awfully long and not very stylish, in my opinion--for what that's worth.    And, sorry, but the way you wrote the question, I was picturing a foot on top of your head.  :-)  BTW, when you go to college, be sure to spell it correctly.|`|v202XHZNaa	Strangely enough, Peas are great for your hair! Not only do they make your hair more vibrant and shiny, but studies show that it increases the speed your hair grows at. Also, One A Day Woman's has vitamins to really help you with growing your hair long, and also to nourish the rest of your body!  Oh, and massaging your scalp more often when in the shower and brushing your hair more often is a big part in helping your hair grow.  Good luck! :)|`|utbfT0APaa	My hair seems to grow faster when I get it cut, other than that el' natural, it only grows so fast.|`|Kao6PotOaa	I really don't know, but I always had thick and long hair since I was 11. But I think it was because I always got braids, because my sister always get braids now and her hair is almost long like mine. My hair is to the middle of my back and I'm only 15. And it grew since I changed my hair dresser. But also try not to over process your hair. If you get perms put them in your hair only when needed and not every week like some people do. And also don't use too much heat. Another thing is trim your hair every six weeks.    Hope I could help!!|`|9vusPsCRaa	Get some Just For Women|`|E14cuDlZaa	Don't cut your hair and eat youur vegetables. :)|`|QSYEn70Oaa	you need to keep your natural hair and wash it, but not everyday,     doing things like dying, straighting, blowdrying, curling, just anything can hurt your hair and will slow down the process, just keep it natural for a while,     use detangler hair spray when your hairs wet, and comb it out, but be careful and dont pull on it,     try not to put your hair in a tight ponytail when you put it up, keep from pulling it,     giving your hair a trim will also help     good luck|`|myuWNLsTaa	theres some really good websites that can tell you seriously google it & you will find answers|`|IdLVjvCmaa	if you keep all of the split ends off so cut them about 1 every two weeks and then wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner. stay away from things like dying and curling and straitening your hair that causes massive split ends.|`|LAcH71Ooaa	wait. theres nuthin u can do to speed it up except keep it really healthy. u might look better with it short. growing it a foot more if its already a bit past ur shoulders probs wont look very good...|`|4H1IBYEHaa	Well go get hair extensions. There is no way to speed up the process of hair growing. Let it grow. Other than that, get hair extensions or a wig.    Wash your hair every other day. Don't dye your hair or straiten it, ETC. it WILL slow down the process and hurt your hair.  Hope I helped!!! :)))|`|afNGvd9Laa	keep trimming it espically the split ends. they'll grow faster without split ends.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	Patience|`|LeoazSyAaa	wash it put somthing in it   idk i have the same ?|`|ff2144b1a80426ad4335c3e5633a290caa	There's certain products you can try, but I've never used them so I'm not sure that they 100% work.   I think your hair will grow on its own, without any help but if your not having any patience and you think it MUST grow, then go check out some salon products.   Most people like short hair, so maybe you'll look prettier with shorter hair than you will with longer hair.   You might look gorgeous with long or short hair, but most times it's not always about the length, sometimes it's the way you style and treat your hair.     Allie|`|smFfcmYuaa	There really isn't any proven way to speed up hair growth. Regular growth in (white) humans is about half an inch per month for hair on the head, in some cases this is greater among asians and typically less among africans (especially african american men for some reason). So what that means is your hair will usually only grow half a foot per year. Since your hair has apparently been growing much less than that you might be malnourished unless you're african american in which case it will likely take you through college until it's particularly long.|`|wIZNsqG1aa	Feet grow on your legs not from your hair.|`|041b0462d79f0e5c2d4dc32dfd70d958aa	There are no sure fire was to to that sweetheart however Puritans Pride sells vitamins for hair.

A4GeVvUeaa	Black hair or just stay with the dark brown hair you have now. Just don't bleach your hair because I honestly think that a tan person with really fake blonde hair looks disgusting.

MAKE SHURE THAT WHEN YOU FLATEN IT, THAT YOU DONT RIPP OFF THE ENDS OF YOUR HAIR!|`|A4GeVvUeaa	I suggest that you use a little bit of CHI Silk Infusion after you straighten your hair. All you need is a little tiny bit and you just pat it into your hair. It'll instantly become smooth and less poofy. Don't use a lot because it'll make your hair look really greasy and nasty.    It's kind of expensive and a small bottle is roughly about $10. It'll last you a long time though so it's worth it.    Here's a site where you can buy it:  http://www.folica.com/CHI_Silk_Infusi_d2...

Pg3voqXkaa	No way!!  I don't share my mascara with ANYONE, including my sister.    Bacteria can be carried over from one person to another and then you could get an eye infection.  It's not worth sharing or borrowing from someone else if it's going to cause someone to walk around with a pink, puffy, ***** eye|`|FklngtvCaa	it's not exactly ideal.  i use my mum's sometimes but i would  never share mascara with a friend, i think  it's gross and unsanitary.    suppose one of you got a sty?  you'd have to throw out the tube and both  suffer.|`|2oYo4krQaa	Absolutely not.  Everyone needs their own make-up.  It's a personal care item like a toothbrush.|`|XSXRVoETaa	i do and i am fine  but you shouldn't|`|BuxDT0Akaa	no. even if its your mom, sister, daughter, cousin, bff, teacher, aunt, NONONONONONONOOOOOOOOOO|`|KL20mZUaaa	OH GOODNESS NO. Pink eye, styes, and other disgusting and highly contagious viruses and illnesses can be caught from this - try avoiding sharing eyeliner aswell. You can share lip gloss with close friends, but getting sick and getting coldsores are very common among sharing these aswell.|`|4v728jw7aa	no you can get an infection!!!|`|AdYiLoO4aa	NO!    http://www.consumerreports.org/health/he...    and you could get pinkeye.|`|Btdc7eQOaa	NO!!!!|`|cjlWiqqCaa	No you should'nt because bacteria from your eye get on the brush then if someone else you uses it . Then it would get in their eye. Yuck!|`|uJB3Yet6aa	you are not supposedd to  but i do any way  i mean whats the big deal?  and the reason people say not to share mascara, is because you have little bugs in your eyelashes, and then when you put on mascara you get them on your brush, then the brush gets in the tube  sounds gross when you say it like that,  but there are bugs everywhere, it doesnt really matter to me|`|aEFTqJOtaa	OMG NO! It is way worse than sharing lipgloss. You could get a terrible eye infection from sharing bacteria|`|h3SvEWJcaa	i think there's no problem, just avoid it if you have any eye infection or use contact lenses|`|ZwVnL32Uaa	if you almost never use it, and if u LOVE that mascara then i wouldnt share it. the brush carries on bactiria from your eyes and you can pass it on to somone else. but if u never use it, then it will carry less bactiria and nothing really will happen.
4tHjpW9saa	girls dont look at the clothes a boy wears   they look at:  his smile  how he treats people  if he is funny  who he hangs out with  his qualities   and a little bit of looks|`|NyiMHsfeaa	4    i hardly ever see guys wear sweats anymore and its not so preppy looking more relaxed which i like    however i dont like when people wear a color over the same color like  2|`|ELy7NK0Eaa	I would like a guy that wears either 1 or 3.  :]|`|16a147d8164f962d7603e2ee7e357ff4aa	I would not worry to much about it, trust me, I know it is very very nerve racking, I have been there, but just simply try your best, do not worry about detail/specifics, that is all you can ask of your self:)|`|Ox7VS6KHaa	No offense, but you shouldn't have to change yourself to get girls to like you! They should like you for you, and girls don't really notice clothes as much.. But if your just trying to get a girl to like you, so you can just use her!

x6eq1XRvaa	im sure you could but it wouldnt have as a good a result as the lotion made speciafically for tanning. hope that helps :)|`|D8nyS1Rfaa	Tanning lotion is not the same as a daily moisturizer.  Tanning lotion has accelerators that boost your skin's production of melanin.  Melanin is what is being browned.  The more melanin you have the brown you will be.      A daily moisturizer will keep you moist but it will not accelerate your tan.      Depending on the size of your body, you should be going through a bottle of lotion between 20 - 30 sessions (between 1 month or 2).  This may seem a lot, but you want to use enough to do a good job.  Roughly 2 tablespoons full of lotion each time.  It could be that you are using too much, maybe not.    Make sure your salon sells you a decent size bottle.  A 7oz bottle will go by fast, but a 10oz bottle will last you.      NEVER buy from walmart, walgreens, drugstores, or ONLINE.  Only by authentic lotion from a indoor tanning studio.|`|h9z1DRUyaa	the tanning salons usually have lotions there you can use =)

7euKjvG9aa	Don't trust anything you see in a black hair care magazine all they are doing is exploiting the hair care needs of the black woman and not delivering what they claim. I used to use Profective it did nothing, Doo Gro.. did nothing. I found out why, petroleum and mineral oil in the products. If it has a high concentration of either ingredient it is not a growth aide, in fact it hinders growth because nothing gets through them, they act as a barrier. When I found blackhairmedia.com's discussion board I found so many products that actually work and I went from pinching a ponytail to midback in less than three years (it would be longer but I used a janky relaxer and my hair fell out and had to be cut off in '07 but now its past bra strap length).   I use mainly natural products and a few commercial products, Hollywood Beauty and Africa's Best oils are my favorites. But I swore off greases and gels.   Castor oil works really good for thickness and length, it stimulates the follicles to make the hair grow faster.   To retain length there is the crown and glory method, just google it... or go to growafrohairlong.com. It works.|`|NGHajxLKaa	Well, there aren't exactly products that make your hair grow, but there are hair care products that protect your hair and make it healthier. I would suggest getting a really good quality shampoo and conditioner and to reduce the damage and strain you place on your hair. I know it's hard, but this process will require lots of patients.|`|wnOHdpCNaa	Lucious?
H1zS1enMaa	Every person is different regarding the hair growth cycle. some ppl's hair grow really long and fast and others grow to a certain length then stops right there.  here are some tips u can try:  1-cut ur ends every 2 months (1-2 cm)  2-if u can brade ur hair do it.It is scientifcally proven that brading is good for ur hair and helps it grow faster.  3-if u go to any indian store there is a hair oil they use i think its called (daber amla) im not sure just ask and they'll know what u r talking about.That is what they use to grow theyre hair and girl ,theyr hair grows really long.  hope these would help.Good luck!!|`|AA10378447	Well, when you say "no pills", I hope you're already taking vitamins. You should take hair, skin and nail vitamins, or at least a women's vitamin with a high amount of folic acid and collagen in it. That will help.    In the meantime, keep it washed/clean, keep it trimmed every 4-6 weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows, and keep the heat to a minimum. Alternate flat-ironing and wrapping or rolling if you need to.
lXBjLRoqaa	Usually they need to get about 10 inches of hair.  There is no way to speed up hair growth. Hair cannot be chemically treated in anyway if you want to donate it.  I recommend getting it trimmed every now and then to get rid of slip ends just because the hair that will get donated will be in better shape.    I think its a wonderful thing you are doing!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	That's great that you want to donate your hair. Pantene Beautiful Lenghts is a great place to donate your hair too.    Here are the requirements to donate your hair they are all on this site:  http://www.beautifullengths.com/en_US/in...    One suggestion when you donate your hair and they cut it have them seprate your hair into 6 pony tails that way they can make a wig from your hair. If they only cut one pony tail the hair isn't going to be all the same length.    Here is the address where you need to send your hair in a zip lock bag.   Pantene Beautiful Lengths  511 Wisconsin Drive  New Richmond, WI 54017-2613    Good luck|`|987923b8a7fffddd6d84106ce71d68a3aa	Locks of Love is a good place for donating long hair. I believe it has to be at least 10 inches in length.

dzJR8Dwvaa	1. Have an experienced hair care professional or stylist trim your split ends.(Please note, a "trim" or "dusting" removes between 1/8 to 1/4 inch of hair.) If you have badly split ends, an inch or two may need to be removed, but it is healthier for your hair in the long run. Remember, trim only for split ends-- otherwise have 1/8 inch trimmed every 8 to 12 weeks: hair grows just one half inch per month and if it is cut more frequently, you will not see any length, since it is being cut as often or more than it is growing.   2. Wash hair as needed depending on your hair type and health. This could be every three days with products that do not contain alcohol or harsh sulfates and are pH balanced. Do not over-wash (once is usually enough), as over washing can cause a dry condition, which will ultimately lead to breakage. While washing, massage your scalp. This will reawaken sleeping follicles and promote thicker healthier hair.   3. Use a regular moisturizing conditioner after every wash, but deep condition at least every week. One week use a moisturizing deep conditioner. The next use a protein or reconstructing conditioner. Doing so will make your hair healthy and strong.   4. Use a daily moisturizer or leave-in conditioner as black hair is prone to dryness. Apply the moisturizer (without petroleum jelly, petrolatum or mineral oil) to the hair from roots to ends and gently massage in. Do this daily or as your hair requires--you want your hair to feel soft and pliable.You may have to experiment with what works for you but Ultra Black Hair Creme Moisturizer, Doctor Miracles, ORS Carrot Oil Cream or Dudley's PCA Moisture Retainer are good moisturizers to try.   5. A light oil (olive, soybean)applied sparingly may be used on your hair after applying a water-based moisturizer in order to seal moisture into the hair shaft and give your hair a nice natural shine. These oils can also be used to relieve a dry scalp.   6. Avoid using blow-dryers as much as possible when drying hair as the excessive heat causes dryness, damage and breakage. Air drying hair is the best method. If the volume of your hair is increased with air drying you can do one of two things: first: apply moisturizer,then air-dry-- this will decrease the volume without causing damage; or second - apply moisturizer and use a dome or bonnet dryer on a cool or warm setting. Never use the highest setting!   7. To get your hair to grow long, you also need to comb it carefully. Be sure to use a wide-tooth comb with no seams and comb it gently from the ends first, as combing from the ends will detangle hair as you comb higher and higher. Never comb from the roots to the ends until your hair is completely untangled.   8. Avoid daily and/or excessive brushing of your hair, as black hair is fragile. Excessive brushing can strip the hair of its protective layers. If you trying to smooth your hairline, brush gently, use a soft boar bristle brush, and make sure your hair is completely dry and moisturized.   9. Make sure you also wrap your hair with a silk/satin head wrap or bonnet before you go to bed at night. Without this protection, your loose hair will move about as you sleep putting stress on your hair, drying it out, and causing split ends.   10. Treat your hair from within by taking a multivitamin. Use a hair vitamin that will increase your hair growth rate and lenghthen your natural anagen (growth phase). Also drink at least eight cups of water and eat healthy foods such as fish, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and by exercising regularly to provide good circulation to the scalp.|`|IodpgIk7aa	getting your hair trimmed every 6 weeks helps because it gets rid of the split ends and breakage. if you go too long without cutting your hair it eventually gets too damaged to grow. also, try shampoos for long hair..i think herbal essences has one.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Brush your hair gently with preferably wooden brushes to increase hair growth. Never brush the hair when it is wet. If one wants to grow hair, trim the hair once every month, just the tips will do.

Also get it trimmed to get rid of split ends, have a healthy diet, also massage your scalp often to help blood flow|`|b3FkhOicaa	Herbal Essences Long and Strong or Garnier Fructis Length and Strength shampoos and conditioners work well.  Also, if you use the Garnier, they also have leave-ins, sprays, mousses, and other stuff for length and strength.  Wash you hair at least every other night, and don't brush it while it's wet- comb it with a wide-tooth comb. Don't use a lot of hairspray or damaging sprays, and don't get highlights or dye your hair.  Also, try not to swim with chlorine a lot.  Good luck!|`|QbFXIwkAaa	My sister had before the same problem like you,she talk to a hairdresser and to a doctor and they suggest her  to use a shampoo with not balm.Put in this shampoo 5 tablets against pregnancy,leave it for 1 week,and then wash your hair every 2 days with it,but don't change kind of shampoo for 8 months.  Now my sister's hair are good.  Have a good luck!|`|b6356b9558163864dfaed163316ee3b1aa	Panteen has a shampoo that makes your hair grown and it really works.

Half the reason (i think) is because i use the flat iron on it everyday and i think i'm frying it.  Well anyways this is what i have heard but never used:    cut your hair to the shortest layer if you have layers. That way your hair can grow at the same time and it will look healthier. Also flip your head upside down and masage your scalp everyday.(yeah like that works). Try not to use to much product on your hair. When brushing your hair brush from the bottom up so you don't rip out any of your hair.    well i hope that works! I got some of those tips from a hair growth website.|`|ykIleAQ7aa	Try using Dabur Amla Oil. I know people who have used it and it works great they say.

Y27ovMdRaa	Sorry, but if you do it wet, it won't be smooth.  Even worse, you risk tangling.|`|26lZZaWNaa	First do you have a perm? If so, wash the hair, blow dry the hair, put some oil sheet on your hair and curl it with hot curlers or roll it on your fingers and put the bobby pins in it. section the hair in small sections when your are doing this. If you don't have a perm you can still do the above, you would just have to straighten your hair first.

(:|`|tnoyKjJ1aa	those are really cute.. i would leave everything else neutral and let the shoes stand out.. wear black leggings or a darker wash jeans with a white, gray, or black shirt|`|VHDLTFG2aa	so as for a color scheme i think you should totally go with some nuetrals like maybe brown for a more natural look. And black for a more rocker look...lol maybe try wearing a mini dress like miley did in the pic on the site....or a pair of dark wash skinny jeans (but you tuck them in the shoes) and like a flowy top and a black cardigan....and wear your hair curly and down to give it a more natural look!!!
hQNHzc6faa	Alot of teasing at the crown area of hair, A lot of hairspray. However, don't expect your hair to look as good as Jennifers cause she probably had some really famous hairstylist do it.

Good Luck.|`|XiT8q49Daa	stay calm....use hair volumizer that is recommended by professional stylist. it'll cost you more, but it's worth it if you wanted that hair. do not change your shampoo brand or wax or hair spray as it'll affect the growth.    find a stylist, if you're a beginner they'll even give you a sample price for first-timers.    do not use curling iron or hair straighteners that often. wait for your hair to grow the exact volume that curl it.|`|dKXfYc2maa	yeah lots of hairspray and a curling iron|`|41UtJiaMaa	volume:  -get out of the shower  -go upside down  -and blow dry. while upside down.  -while its almost dry, tease it a little bit with some mousse.     **if it doesnt work, you can rat it underneath like the 60s:D    hope it workss(;|`|y7OLG5rIaa	when your hair is damp, put mousse in it that is designed for curls, blowdry, use a curling iron to achive the curls you want, and get a strong hold hairspray to finish!  the larger the cylinder on the curling iron is, the bigger, more loose curls you will get!|`|FIFoGNIxaa	Use lots of hairspray!!!!

11BPJiECaa	they are probably culottes  which are longer, very wide-legged pants. Because the legs of the pants are so wide and have so much material, when the legs are close together, it gives the appearance that one is wearing a skirt.  hope this helps!  ?  ooops i forgot u said they were tight around the ankles! they couldve been parachute pants! lol|`|nBhUQRDAaa	are you talking about gauchos?

3L9bRmOqaa	Because the US dollar is so low around the world, prices in Europe will be higher than the US (that is why you see so many tourist from other countries buying luxury items by the bulk load in the U.S.).  However, note that a Vuitton from the Vuitton store in Paris, France is more desireable for Vuitton collectors than those made in San Dimas, California (where the US Vuitton bags are made).|`|7mmmGytpaa	maybe, since you don't have to pay tax if you don't live there.|`|ZQbXSkTkaa	It'll probably be more expensive. Things tend to cost a lot more in Europe then in the U.S.|`|uFBXM4rIaa	no, surprisingly the US carries the cheapest real louis vuitton bags. france would be slightly more expensive.
wmz1oGaYaa	you..know you can get something to apply to your hair if you feel that by flat ironing it looks better check with Sally Beauty Salon they should have something to apply first to the hair then flat iron from there and always remember to condition once a week and to keep those splits ends cut every/2-3weeks..Hope this helps!|`|CAY9zwp8aa	I need to stop too.

	It all depends on the girl. For some girls, nice abs on a guy are a small turn on, but for others its a big turn on.  In my opinion, and in most of my friend ,nice abs are a big turn on.|`|	To some girls it's a big turn on. But for me it isn't...    Sure, having a really athletic ability is great! As long as their body isn't DISGUSTINGLY muscular! I'd prefer a guy who's smart, cute, sweet, not fat, but slim, and strong enough to do work, play sports etc.     So it really depends on who you aim for!|`|	I guess it depends on the girl and what she is attracted by.  Some girls love great eyes or smile, so abs would be a bonus.  Some girls would really like abs a lot.  But can I be straight with you?  It doesn't really matter as much as you think.  Ultimately, girls want a great guy.  So if the great abs are on a cocky, arrogant guy, it doesn't make any difference.  Its more important that you are a gentleman, smart, intelligent, etc.  Overall handsomeness is great with or without abs but a guy who knows he's hot is a big turnoff.|`|	it depends....I know everyone has different tastes  one of my friends likes chubby guys while the other has an obsession with abs    Honestly, my turn on is a beautiful face  I don't care about abs or whatever  I just like pretty boys for some reason|`|	i think ab's are superr hott. (:  totall turn on.|`|	abs are good but muscly arms are soooo much better:)|`|	Hm. I guess I like abs.. but its not a 'huge turn-on' for me.     For me, I just like guys with nice faces, and who are athletic. A little muscle definitely doesn't hurt. But I just don't like when guys have an obsession over their body, trying to get it as muscular as possible, and bragging about it.|`|	i guess its a turn on for gals...if tehy liek abbs|`|	They are sexy|`|	when a guy has great abbs it is a huge turn on.  it shows that a guy is athletic and takes care of himself.  and there really great to look at and feel lol.|`|	its just a small turn on for me because i don't really care if a guy has abs or not i would prefer  if the guy was smart.|`|	all girls thinks its hot when they see guys with abs! I DO!!!!!!|`|	It's really hott but don't expect the girls to go crazy over you. Just so you know. I think it makes me want the guy but not for very long.|`|	i have never gotten turned on by abs at all.|`|	I have never been an ab person. I feel like a "real" man doesn't spend time obsessing over his body. But that is just me. So I am not turned [by abs] on at all generally speaking. Although the cuts on a mans hips right before his pubic area starts is unbelieveably HOT. If my husband had those, I wouldn't keep my hands off of those scrumdiddliumptious things.
tsw2LxtLaa	Toner helps to "close" your pores after cleansing. It washes away any cleanser you missed and tightens your pores. You can use a toner which usually has a little alcohol or an astringent which has a high proportion of alcohol. An astringent is too drying unless your face is oily. Natural product examples: Gentle toners are rosewater or orange water and an astringent is witch hazel.     When you're picking a toner, look at how much antiseptic stuff it has so that it's not too drying for your skin. Personally I've used and liked some Clean and Clear stuff and Clinique.     I don't think it's bad to use a different cleanser toner... whatever works for your face is good :)|`|riIwX8TZaa	Toner helps cleaning/ taking off make-up more deeply. It removes impurities and make-up residues. I don't think it would make a difference if you use different cleanser, toner etc.|`|TprIqGhCaa	Toner just helps even out your skintone. It's not bad to use all those things, it'll actually help make your skin look nice.|`|KrC3asyRaa	toner, closes pore, removes excess impurities, BUT it also regulates your pH level in your skin, when you cleanse your face your altering the pH level and it takes your skin 8hours to go back to a normal level, toner helps to go back straight away. it primes your face for moisturiser.  your moisturiser actually works 10x better when you cleanse and tone,    look for the alcohol free toners, and the ones with alot of chemicals, and alcohol will dry your face.    http://www.nutrimetics.com.au/leanneleac...    if your skin doesnt react to all the different products then go ahead and use them  But keep in mind that your cleanser, toner moisturiser will work at its optimum when using the same brand.

K2jjYfTWaa	DO NOT USE THE HAIR DYE FROM THE DRUG STORE! IT IS BAD FOR YOUR HAIR! Go to Sally's if you have one or another beauty supply store and get professional color and developer. I personally use the Wella color line and developer. I do hair and trust me, it is bad for your hair. If you are going to be highlighting you might need bleach. If you buy a cap you can do it yourself pretty easily. Foiling will make the highlights appear more natural but the cap method is ok. If you have someone who is mildy good with hair you should have them foil your hair. This website explains it well.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWywqcFXH...    If you are going to highlight your hair make sure that you get the proper developer. For each 10 vol of developer you get 1 level of lift. For example if you want to go from a level 7(light brown/blonde) to a level 9(light blonde but not bleach blonde) you would want a 20 vol developer because you need 10 vol for each level of lift and you are lifting 2 levels. You will need the proper developer whether you choose to use bleach or color. My suggestion for color is:    http://www.sallybeauty.com/wella-haircol...    This is a light blonde with golden undertones.    For bleach I would use:    http://www.sallybeauty.com/Prism-Lites-T...    This is a blue-bleach. It covers over hard to dye or lift hair like greys and black.    GOOD LUCK!|`|1a4185c424769310fc40cc1fa4cd3394aa	Very successful. I personally do not dye my hair, but I've dyed many of my friends. It depends on which kind you get and how long it is supposed to last.|`|BIl7YqhUaa	It's not the do it yourself dye you need to worry about, most of them are fine, it's the effectiveness of the person dying your hair. I personally learned a long time ago, it's well worth the money to pay a professional than trust myself! lol|`|FqRxiHnTaa	well wen i first highlighted my hair on my own, it didnt turn out so good. I left in the dye just like 5 minutes over what it was supposed to be and my highlighted hair was orange!!!!!! It was horrible. So now i just save up money and get my hair highlighted at a salon.|`|f5a7ea79ccd8c25d67db179e3eb300f5aa	Actually, Boxed hair dyes- the kind you get from the store, actually last longer than professional hair dyes. Any hair colorist will tell you this. As far as highlighting your own hair- same rule applies. They last longer. If you dye your hair first, wait a day or so before you highlight it. Also when you do highlight your hair- make sure you are careful where you put the highlights- as in make sure they are not too close together or it can look really chunky and/or messy.     I am sure you will do fine! I dye my own hair all the time and I have highlighted my sister's hair.     Good luck!|`|JsDHeWiZaa	they are very effective if you follow the directions - if you arent getting the shade you are looking for, next time leave the dye in a little longer.|`|Vs0IUubzaa	The boxed kits are fine but if you can get the supplies from a beauty supply store and mix them yourself it's better.  The other thing to try is look for a salon that has students, you can get the same work done for much much cheaper and a licensed stylist supervises the students.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Go to a beauty supply store to get your products over the store bought ones. There is more selection in color and developers to get the exact color you want.  They work well if you can do that to yourself. It's kinda hard to do by yourself, but can be done. Maybe check on youtube for a video about how to do hair color and highlighting to yourself.

The shirts nice, but stick with that pink. May I suggest a jacket that is that solid color. Dont do the shoes, thats the wrong color pink and theres black when the shirt is white/pink.  The earrings are nice but dont bother with that outfit, the necklace works, the bracelet is red, like I said before stick with pink or white of that shade of the shirt.  Your accessories should work around your clothes, so stick with yellow(the logo) bright pink (the pattern) and white would be a secondary color because its the main color of the shirt.     Hope I helped!|`|16KUkMP0aa	I like the top, shoes and pants together. I'm not a big fan of anything else though sorry. Try just a simple pair of earrings like studs. The bracelet is ok.

0cogeMrRaa	i've been drinking aloe vera drinks for a few days now, and apparently they're good for your hair, skin and nails. i've noticed my hair seems to be feeling a bit softer and getting a bit longer. i know it sounds a bit exaggerated, but it's true!     i looked up tips on how to grow hair longer quickly a while ago, and here are some points i remember:  - a healthy diet of course ; vitamins, protein, all that good stuff.  - when you're washing your hair in the shower, don't tangle it all up on the top of your head, pull down.  - when washing your hair, massage your scalp with small circular motions.   - when your hair is wet, comb it with a wide tooth comb instead of a brush, to prevent breakage.    that's all i really remember. what i do is when i'm at home and have nothing to do, i pull my hair. i know it sounds weird, but it's not like i try to rip it out of my scalp. but i occasionally do it when i'm watching tv or something.    anyways, i hope i helped!|`|654d5146948b9a667ab1e0b36ce93e3eaa	becasue you have curly hair it is dry so therefore more split ends  - even though you afre getting it trimmed every 7 weeks your hair is splitting making it shorter. With curly dry hair you need to get it trimmed say every 4 weeks as that will manage it and you will definately notice it greoing longer - my hair was the same and i tried everything and it just would grow soooooooo slow until i found a hairdresser who said come to me evry 4 weeks for a trim and you will notice - in one year my hair went from just past my shoulders to half way down my back - BIG improvement|`|Hx4AqA98aa	biotin, and use remedies and vitamins|`|zSWt0sYzaa	you can buy a hair growth treatment at your local beauty store.

4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	On your face, I would exfoliate. They will fade over time. Try Avon Clinical Microdermabrasion. Its about $28 a bottle and totally worth it. I noticed that exfoliation helps you look fresh and radiant.     You might also try Mederma. Its a scar treatment cream. Any pharmacy or Walmart will carry it. Its about $10-12...not so sure how it work on scars of the face from acne, but its a general scar cream.    Wanna prevent future scars on the body itself? Keep Neosporin with you at all times. Just like you would lip gloss or powder. If you nick your legs shaving...1st and foremost....Neosporin...hands...legs...a...

I never cared about sneakers until now.... lol I'm serious...    So umm, my opinions are:    I liked number 4, it looks really cool and stylish  Number 5 is really cool if you like that color, and it is a little bit more, "fancy" than the others.  Number 7 is also cool because it is kind of simple, but if you really wanna put some style into your shoe, I suggest you pick  4.  7 if you don't want to have any additional decorations for your shoe, and number 5 would be my second choice.    So my final answer is number 4.    Can't wait till tomorrow for part 2!|`|AsVHdOQ4aa	number 4|`|m1vjzcfNaa	i like number 2 the best|`|YpRBBRFQaa	number 4 & 7 are so cool!!!the white ones are good if you just want some nice sneakers that look really good((as a matter of fact i would get them myself...they're goregous))but if yuu wanna be like "BAMM!!LOOK AT ME!!"go for the air jordans ^^ don't go for plain-looking shoes.|`|LfMtr5t5aa	Nike   airforce 1 Supreme!!!!

If I were him, I'd definitely like you just the way you are.|`|t26ctJdraa	ur pretty just like that. mayb just a touch more of mascara but i mean it ur naturally pretty|`|DobKxnWBaa	profile is set to private      he should like you for whats on the inside, dont be so materialistic
S1tddghuaa	i have brown eyes too.   i use purple eyeliner or gray eyeliner they make your eyes pop. especially the purple.   theres stuff available at maybelline for brown eyes.|`|46nFI18Haa	like in kill bill? where she stpeed on the ye. and it popped?  rip ur eye out of the socket, and step on it. it will pop|`|Ul1OCP8Iaa	Wear a lot of white, and browns to make those beauties pop out. Any earthy color would work, like greens, oranges, yellows, and definitely red.|`|yhGNTRE8aa	I have brown eyes.  Black eyeliner on top and bottom, not that thick though.  Then wear a sparkly silver eyeshadow, or Darkish blue. Green is also  pretty|`|KkFKdRG8aa	i have dark brown eyes and usually when i wear thick black eyeliner and some shimmery eyeshadow;doesnt matter what color really; my brown eyes stand out alotttt|`|MONbNUmkaa	dark liner on top and bottom, then light shadow on lid with dark in crease out to the corner, put a sweep of lighter(shimmery)shadow on brow (all in same family color), don't forget to go with multiple application of mascara|`|KbUIttmqaa	i usually use black liner all the way around. sometimes i use olive green or purple. (Sephora carries them) and sparkly silver eyeshadow (urban decay Strip- sephora)|`|38GEhj3iaa	Green or purple eye shadow!!! Or try a shimmery gold eye shadow. Also, try a dark plum eyeliner on your top lid!    I do all of the above^^
ZEmlT5aEaa	i think the 3rd one was the best! i have a purity ring just like it :)|`|CkEkYZ5Kaa	The first one is the only one that really gets the message across.   God bless!|`|AiTieSu2aa	i like the 2nd the best.    and the 4th is def way too wedding-ish your right|`|AdYiLoO4aa	i like the first one,    but the one i have is  http://www.adifferentdirection.com/detai...    and its GREAT  didnt turn my finger green or anything  i have had it for about two years.|`|BkJK2U10aa	Number 3|`|IF2nOOPqaa	The 3rd one all the way! the first once is a little 2 simple and the second one is pretty but the 3rd one blows the rest away and the last one looks 2 engagement ringish and silver or white gold better than gold.    xoxo|`|8IhNkHZ9aa	i think the 2nd and 3rd ones are the prettiest. sry dont kno about how long they last and what not|`|ADWIWx5Baa	The 2nd one :)|`|AA10397805	I have the third one, it goes with anything :)|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Number 3 is so pretty! :)|`|KKxX5wszaa	Personally, I really like the third and fourth one the best. Though, since you're obviously not getting married, the fourth one does look a bit marriageish. I personally am very attracted to the last two because it has more class and trend to it. Like it has more of a valuable look. The other two bands are too simple, and look like any other ring. Plus, they kind of look cheap. Also, you wanted a ring that wouldn't want to turn your finger green, so stick to something that has a name. I would recommend on not purchasing things from Ebay. Nordstrom is a great store, so probably sticking to that place is the best. But the real answer is it doesn't matter which ring it is. As long as your are committed to what the ring actually stand for, then the ring is perfect! I hoped that I helped!|`|EiWcberlaa	number 2&3
fMPyLqW4aa	I think a cardigan with a thin belt on top of it looks really cute. I also think you should try layering racerback tanks with boy tanks or just different styles of tanks with different style. Mix up the color too. Try picking contrasting colors.|`|FyI9qlxBaa	well you can change around the colors, but an outfit like this would be mega cute:  bright yellow capris, a long pink tank top, and a graphic tee that matched. maybe some converse, and a couple brightly colored neclaces.maybe some bracelets too!!!!|`|acDUuG6Eaa	What i do sometimes is put a regular tee under a tank top.  Look at pacusun for some cute tank tops(:
myVECzQZaa	1st I dont kno y people give rude remarks? its like dont answer the quetion if you dont like it, no ones asking u to right? sencond I think you should die your hair the color you getting the extensions.. and not to like ruin nething but the clip extensions are so overrated. there not worth it. if your payin that much u should get them sewed in, they last wayy longer and look better... and dying your hair yourself will be way cheaper.. so id do that.. hope i helped|`|AA11313920	Sorry about the Sally's recommendation - erm, there's always HairExtensions.com, but their human hair extensions are on the pricey side.  You want to make sure it says "clip-in extension" or it'll just be hair.  You could use an at home root touch up, that would be less than going to a salon.  I'd also be careful with getting the extensions though, so maybe you would want to dye your hair all over, just so your color matches all the way throughout (since the highlights would stop at the extensions). But I'd be careful dying it dark brown, I have a classmate who got blonde highlights and when she tried to dye her hair back, it looked orange ]:|`|JzTg0hg5aa	clip in extensions are around 100-200. it depends on where you get them from, how long they are, and how much your getting. you should probably buy the least expensive but good quality ones you can find and just get your roots redone. I dont know how much that would cost but, Im guessing they would be to much.      good luck [:

NaEkFE77aa	Red jewerley!  Get some bracelets and earrings.|`|HLMzKR53aa	the sweater is soooo cute and i have those jeans too! (i actually wore them today lol)    but i would say pretty much any color tank top under the swaeter. i would say either pink for your hair or brown if you have blue eyes. and deffinitly flats with the jeans. very pretty!|`|xQiNe72Waa	I would wear gray converse with that. Also, I would wear a white cami under that sweater.|`|exFsWQy7aa	how bout a blue tank to match your eyes and the gray converse to give a prep/punk look  kinda like mine  =D|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	I'd say a plain brown top, because brown brings out blue eyes.    But if that's a bit boring to you, you could probably add some colour, I'm not sure which colour goes with strawberry blonde hair, but I think a plain block coloured top would be best because a pattern would have too many things going on at once.|`|9RajlJpRaa	black flats. converses may look to emo. i would wear something blue underneath. either a tank or a cardigan. you can mix prints with this outfit since its basic. but deffinately put some color in there girl!|`|k0g1qjoXaa	A fine cotton red scoop neck shirt!|`|s6qPzTgEaa	with the white sweater you can wear a purple or black tank top underneath  and the black flats|`|4VN9nmPAaa	a black lace tank! so pretty and the converse add a touch of funkyness :)|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I'd wear a V neck T.|`|5bWYjqO9aa	i say try on a few things and see what goes with what thats how i decide!!   :)|`|dNeeACtWaa	All of your colors or neutral so just go with a cami of any color!!! I recommend Niki Biki camisoles cuz their "multi-functional" and super durable....;)|`|bYoGeKUUaa	a nice white lacy tank and layer that with VANS.|`|Q8etYn60aa	Okay, for the sweater, I'd wear some kind of solid color underneath.  Nothing with a low neckline or a collar.  For the white one, I'd probably wear a gray shirt, it would match nicely with the gray converse.  Or maybe even wear a pinkish color underneath, it would be a nice pop of color.  A dark green fitted tee would be cute too!  I wouldn't wear black flats with it!    Hope this helps! (:

Hzf3QK9faa	Well, it's not my fave, but it's your hair.

Good Luck.|`|CEENX0sDaa	ew i dont like it    btw is that sandra nasic?|`|IeBFFBmnaa	dreadlocks are ugly   ok like matted hair in a braid dont get them

I have them.|`|FpF6tuzpaa	most definitely. they will probably be in for awhile|`|65G38NZAaa	Yes, i have them and many people i know do, also.  You can never go wrong with side bangs [:|`|eBT6dNOcaa	yep.    but im growing mine out.
YAJrXPXuaa	Are you allowed to wear jewelry at your school?     I'm sure you don't need peoples advice on wat to wear... just search thru your room and find an accessorie you like.
JkpyLnfDaa	measure your waistline and that is what their sizes go by(:  i have a pair of guys jeans myself so if someone has something to say then forget them ha  i wear a 2 and a 25 in guys jeans ha so you can base it off that and say a 30 or so|`|xJ0HJKlXaa	30 or 32ish. i used to wear guys wranglers all the time cuz i had no hips and girls would balloon out. not to mention guys pants come in diff lengths.|`|1eWDadlFaa	Umm, why do you want to wear guy pants? Just go to the store and try them on, there are only like 6 billion American Eagle stores out there.
FaBaLnm0aa	Not necessarily. It depends on the brand and technique you use to put it on. If you use a liquid foundation it's best to use a foundation brush to apply it. That way you get more of an even application w/o using too much. When you use your hands to put it on people usually use too much and it looks cakey. MAC has nice foundations that can help you achieve different looks. You have to go to a department store that carries it or else you will have a really hard time finding it online. (Macys, Nordstrom, etc.) Their makeup artist will sit you down right there and help you find your color and the look you're trying to achieve. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, minerals give your skin a very healthy and natural look. And it's supposed to be better for your skin. I use Bare Minerals by Bare Essentuals. You can get the The Get Started Kit or something like that. Sephora sells it and actually I thought I saw it in Target believe it or not. They have their own stores as well but I'm not sure where you're from. But it consists of 2 colors (med. and med. beige for example), 1 translucent finishing powder, 1 bronzer, 1 "blush" color, a flawless application brush and one for more concentrated areas, along with a how-to DVD. I bought it bc I wanted to give it a try and I really liked it. It always looks so natural. And it's a huge line with many different kinds of looks to choose from. You should check it out.<br>  <br>  I'm not a cosmetologist, but I wanted to be so I love make up and am always trying different kinds. Hope this helped!|`|Lp4JfVTRaa	no, it takes out any natural flush you had in your cheeks,  If you wear foundation, make sure you wear a LITTLE blush or bronser to return the glow/color to your face|`|GBOgsAoDaa	yes
s7MfxwkBaa	Maybe a cute dress, depending on the weather. If its cold and there is snow then a cute pair of skinny jeans and a bright top is cute. I love katy perry's style its very bright and fun. so what ever you wear, use alot of colour. Try shopping at Sirens its not that much money and theres cute stuff there. Hope i helped, have fun at the concert:)

24cUKZDgaa	maybe get a patch or something and make them all patched up ?  ooor , make the whole bigger to make it look more ripped.  or cut emm , no seriously, make em jean shorts with the "torn" look at the ends.|`|DbdsOblQaa	Place a block of wood (or some other solid surface that you don't mind possibly damaging) within the pant leg or denim region you want to distress.   Rub a steak knife or cheese grater vertically or horizontally against the area of denim that you would like to distress. Rub gently for mild distress; rub longer and more vigorously to create more visible distress (such as holes and tears).   Do not cut holes with scissors. This creates an unfrayed, and consequentially unstylish bland hole.   Fray jeans by rubbing sandpaper around pockets, knees, hemlines, or any other area of denim that you would like to have a soft, worn appearance.   Dampen a sponge with bleach and rub it around the outer edges of holes for a faded look.   Tear off a back pocket.   Wash your jeans.   Wear your newly stylish distressed jeans.

r4CJ0NbHaa	i say whatever you are comfortable with if you wanna wear them go for it!|`|QrjjiOgTaa	thongs are supposed to make you look and feel sexy and you are too young to feel sexy and no one should be looking at you in that way.|`|ymnlQsNIaa	I think thats a little too young      When I think of  a thong, I immidietly associate with sexuality. Its supposed to be teasing and sexy. So, if I'd see that on a 12 years old, I'd be kind of alarmed.|`|GAxHzgEEaa	Ok.  wait a minute  you are to young to be wearing thongs, g-strings, or anythings of the sort lol.    but i can understand not wanting a huge wedgie or granny panties but you can wear the bikini and boyshort kinds.    i personally like boyshorts|`|EXWpMIZJaa	i thinks its a little 2 young ppl young teens don't need to be wearing thongs!!|`|t24aL6qVaa	I'm in that age group and I think they're hot. But some people think they're like butt-floss....point is, if you love wearing them, then wear them. It doesn't matter what other people think. I think if a girl 12-14 wants to wear them, then go for it...it's your decision...|`|wqtwzzPeaa	I think it's a bit slutty to just wear them all the time, like with jeans and what not. I'm 14 and I only wear them with tight sweatpants that would look silly if I wore regular underwear.|`|sHL4wRMNaa	here's the deal. thongs look nice, and all but u are way to young - most of the time u wear it if u'r clothes are too skimpy or see through or if ur trying to impress a guy u are gonna be intimate with. otherwise they have no purpose. frankly i don't know why they are so popular. it's like having a permanent wedgie, they are not comfortable. most of them are just bad materials. but most of all thye are not hygenic... that's right, the pass all the guck down there up and down, causeing more urinary infections than girls who dont' wear it. i mean wear regular underwear. so it might look cool and u might feel cool in them but in the long run, comfort is important and u'r health. so i say u wait till you have your first boyfriend around 20 then u try them on for him.. but not everyday... to uncomfy....|`|VRqF9vMRaa	shure if you like em.  but you will be trying to be way older than you are.  muy agrandada.  thats my oppinion  im your age so, ya.|`|igrdohopaa	Your comfortable, go for it.

There is nothing sexy about a little girl nor should she be showing them to anyone.
w7m52T9Waa	wow, what are you talking about, your hair looks fine straightened.    i would search for that curler and beach wave it still.    and side bangs.|`|cXRRP6ttaa	i think u should get a little tousled wave like Blake Lively from Gossip Girl. u can also add highlights.    see if ur hair curls up after spraying it w/curling product. try aveda's. twirl sections of hair (about 2 inch) and pin it to ur head. take out the pin after like 15-20 minute. and then u can use like a texturizer or spray to hold it.    i think ur hair can look naturally pretty curly. it doesn't look too thick to resist the nice curl look.    check out Johnny Lavoy styling tips on youtube. they're quick and doable.|`|eBT6dNOcaa	grow it out.|`|akIIIE8saa	i think u should  get side bangs|`|DTKJM3oAaa	http://www.latest-hairstyles.com/teens/i...

Also, if you don't want to continue to have to straighten it, get it chemically straightend, its surprising cheap, especailly if you get all of this done at a beauty school, they know what their doing, but they'll charge you like nothing!!|`|z6iQ2Uobaa	Don't straighten it, mousse/scrunch it.|`|QwBepNBuaa	a side fringe
31NapKplaa	you can get spray thats made for uggs|`|qxAcwDsjaa	considering uggs are dead sheep that you put on ur feet, hmm, odorous? possibly. or maybe ur feet stink. either way, its still amde from the ripped off skin of an inhumanely murdered mammal, to be made into way to expensive shoes. you really shouldnt wear them, unless you dont care about animals. but think about this. what if someone ripped your skin off to make shoes for sheep. yea, it sounds just as stupid the other way around.|`|8np3kmvyaa	take them to the cleaners|`|AA11560862	I use baby powder on my running shoes, and it works fine.|`|EXNdGyLtaa	TWO YEARS?!! That's a long time to have a pair of those; I threw mine out after three months... they started to look worn, so I just got new ones.   You should get replace them at least every winter....

3Z4YFz29aa	not anorexic looking. That's gross. Guys don't get turned on by seeing girls who look like they've come from a concentration camp.    Maria Sharapova has a great body- athletic and lean|`|Ucz4Q6DTaa	yes|`|JqfmDzRSaa	it's like hair color, different guys like different things|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Yes my man prefers a skinny girl|`|J4z4mO7Vaa	Well the guys I know hate the skinny, up and down look in a girl.    You need a little meat on you to firstly look healthy and it is much more of a turn on.    Guys like slim girls with curves...  Look at Beyonce, she has a perfect body, he isn't a stick though + she still has curves and guys go nuts over her body!   Hope this was helpful! :)|`|AA11828525	Skinny girls are... nasty.   There's no meat or skin on them, you're pretty much hitting a pole. And most skinny girls are flat.

I want a healthy girl which will probably an average girl who just enjoys eating and after that go outdoors to lose those calories (not run but play a little basketball or tennis, something outdoorsy).     The thing I think about anorexia is its horrible, its not healthy at all. I dont get why girls wnat to be that skinny. Guys wont even get a girl like that because they to scared to even touch her because she might break (I wouldnt want a girl like that). Also when you and her walk around and people start staring at you, they will think you made her that way. So being average and being the weight you love is great (but if she love being anorexia, eh Im just going to say her beauty rate will go down).|`|3093NaFDaa	not too skinny. not too fat. not too muscular. somewhere in the between|`|LwuyDjUtaa	i'm not a guy, but I just wanted to say GREAT QUESTION!!! i am kinda curvy i guess you would say, or maybe just at the top half of the "normal bar" for weight, and my school is filled with girls who are about 5 feet and about 60-95 pounds. I am 105. am i overweight (5'1")?|`|TyQVTvw1aa	A gentleman would like a girl for what she is inside not outside...but of course guys will be guys and they like that arm candy|`|GxbXseoqaa	Im a very athletic girl, play soccer, so i have a lot of muscle, especially on my legs. But a lot of my friends are sticks. I get as many if not more guys than they do. Idk i guess it depends on the guy, but ALOT of the guys at my school think stick skinny girls are DISGUSTING! like im not exagerating, ALOT of them think its gross. If you have curves, love everything about them, because the majority of guys LOVE them :)|`|BdhOvKaAaa	No. I like a women with curves|`|1d6e31e52ee3100a00fb969b5f4f94f3aa	OK, a lot of people complain about not being skinny saying, 'it's  genetics, guys like curves, they're not healthy, they don't eat, or even I hate them, blah, blah, blah'    Some people ARE naturally thin, take my sister, she eats like a pig but if anyone saw her on the street they'd bet 20 bucks she's anorexic (she's bony but it's not her fault, she CANNOT for the life of her get curves and some people cannot for the life of them be skinny, but you don't have to hate the skinny girls, ok?) Guys will take whatever they can get and girl's with no meat shouldn't be talked bad about because you're jealous. grrr.    This isn't directly at you, but I'm sick of fat girls getting mad at skinny people and calling them anorexic, we're all different and beautiful in our own ways!|`|46nFI18Haa	i like girls wiht boobs, ***, and a sense of style(won't find that here:/)  anorexia turns me off|`|2wrEoTYgaa	Your the type of person who seems like she would make fun of a girl like this. I NATURALLY have a extremely petite body, and i'm very self-concious about it. Being called a twig and a stick everyday is just as bad as being called fat.     So why try to punish a girl for what she was born with.. we make up for it with no boobs.|`|5lpi9zMcaa	yes|`|O0S189PQaa	guys like all types of girls.  so there.|`|mIlWfcOVaa	Me personally like straight girls (not lezbien or bi like that, like straight looking figure[lol])    but anorexia is just too much i hate nicole richie stick figures
tFIS2HbVaa	uhm, it's a part of my daily wardrobe. lol.   mine are usually white and long sleeved. i always wear them un-tucked with jeans and sneakers... and sometimes a colorful scarf.  i think the fabric is cotton... hmm... i love white button down shirts. =D  I also wore white short sleeved button down shirts from elementary to highschool. school uniform. oh yeah, i'm 17 and in college.|`|0emslEdiaa	When I was in the Navy, my daily uniform was the BDU or camo uniform.  It was button down with long sleeves but we were required to roll up the sleeves in hot weather.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	At my old job it was, it was grey, 3/4 sleeves and button down with a collar. I didn't like it. And I now avoid button down shirts if I can. I think you can look professional without wearing a dull and boring button down shirt.   At my new job though, we work with people in the community, so it is important to match with what they are wearing so we don't look too out of place. So I now just wear jeans and a normal kind of top that I would wear if I was heading out to the shops or going to see friends.
AA12270223	I think you need to take care of her belly hair before you work on anything else!!|`|RytpxfDbaa	sorry i was too busy looking at her/his abs. i advice putting on a proper shirt b4  i can even observe the hair.  hahah|`|7OjiB7vWaa	black with no highlights and straight hair...haha|`|nzPZYgY6aa	dayuuuuuuuummmmmm. hottt (:       i would take out the "gray" looking highlights..

eLAkduCJaa	I'd pick the last one. Sleek, straight hair would fit you. She looks like you actually, except you have brown hair.|`|hWpnKFi7aa	get the last one.  the first one would look too old on you.  the second set of bangs are pretty in the second set.   and the layered ones in the third one would be great.  ive had it before. but my hair grows super fast and it grew out of that in a few months. :\|`|w3feYgkCaa	I like your hair, but if you want to I would suggest the last one which is razored hair with choppy layers ( which I have). I gives you a messy look and you can tease it and add volume.   It would look really pretty on you.  (:|`|WlFxAna8aa	second one|`|MzoRUhW1aa	I would do the first hair cut choice, but add layers to make your hair look more full with the second choice bangs.|`|3SJGGOORaa	I think the last one would look cute on you.
C5Wlt3rGaa	Well, she is wearing a really flowie dress.  Usually you wear sun dresses and things that flow.  And sandals! Cute ones, though.|`|k3LbhASGaa	genetics|`|gfksposqaa	It's January, you would look weird, embrace the winter look for now.|`|sIdoUK2Laa	well in the movie that look was acheived by wearing a long sleeve tee like a dress and using the arms as halter straps.  haha good luck|`|BnPe68lmaa	You could wear very light and bright colors. Don't wear dark colors. Be a happy person. You could also get bright highlights for your hair.|`|dQ21VvHUaa	are you really that stupid..........|`|okH04Nhlaa	Take a picture|`|yChNsa85aa	blonde hair with one blue streak in it, white skin (she doesn't look tanned),  same colour of hair streak halter top..|`|isPCwnNzaa	Sara Paxton is on the right.
giiPKUTraa	no.|`|hO5yWdvmaa	Yeah, I dont think so either you have really cute face but I dont think the piercing will work for you..    try getting your nose pierced instead?
k36Lr58aaa	ahha, I used to have the same problem.x)   Eat healthy foods, get some fresh air and after taking a shower ( warm water ] apply some moisturizer that says it'll even out your skin tone. Cocoa butter has deep conditioning and it helps your skin color. OH, and get some sun rays. I know how people are saying that you'll get skin cancer, but that's only when you do an overload. The sun has vitamins so it could give your face a nice glow to it :) Vitamin D helps too. Exercising will get your blood flowing and give a healthy look to your face.|`|pdtAmIPyaa	buy some bronzer|`|Zqr4D4Egaa	I use a tinted moisturizer. It'll even out your skin tone and won't clog your pores.
9iXGakohaa	It's probably a birthmark. It's more common than you'd think but don't worry, you can easily dye it. Buy a kit from the drugstore or ask your stylist at your next appointment about what would be the best way to camouflage it.|`|gqLd3itAaa	i have that too, i am 13, its from stress. Dye it, or just leave it|`|4sVB0efkaa	Dye it.|`|3SJGGOORaa	I doubt it will go away, I would dye it to match the rest of your hair.|`|w3feYgkCaa	Haha, my friend has a little patch of white hair. If you want to dye it you can, but you could work it, and make it look unique. Like putting little clips in your hair. They probably thought you dyed it gray anyways, Just put it into style in your own little way (:|`|aCmc52DFaa	I actually kind of envious of you.  If it is one long streak anyway...  I think it adds character.  Stacy London from What Not To Wear has a grey streak in her hair ( its natural and i think she's actually had it since she was around your age...), and I think it looks good.
xWD4XG7Naa	try getting a make-over and buying things that make u feel comfortable (don't over do it) even if its sexy undies...practice looking at yourself in the mirror and telling yourself ur beautiful. when u are in public, try to exude confidence. if u think people are staring, smile or look them in the eye. Stand tall, keep clean, smell fresh, and good luck.|`|M0mVCl4Uaa	just smoke weed|`|bOduFl9Baa	Did you ever try just letting it go, and maybe realizing that nobody's looking at YOU. All they see has nothing to do with what you think. Look there are 6.2+ billion people on the planet, do think someone has enough time to pick just you to "STARE" at. To make sense of it all, try and look back on when this fear you created originated, find the story you created about all these people you think are out to get you and let that go.|`|JhStKzRiaa	I agree with Duy. They wouldn't be staring at you that long if they thought you were ugly! =)|`|IeZkqmIQaa	Just think that everyone is staring at you because you are pretty. Think about all the guys looking at you and you see their eye glow cause they be like "wow, she is so damn stunning". They might nto come up to you because they might feel the same way and be like she will never go out with me. I mean if you were ugly, I dont think alot of people will be staring at you taht long when they can stare at a beautiful girl. Getcha gonna fella :)       EDIT. (I know this last sentence doesnt make sense but it seems catchy and i guess I was having a random moment haha).|`|iTKhQKdBaa	you're probably not done growing. could be your hair cut, it might now fit your face. and i do that too like if there something i dont like i have to fix it over and over but then i have friends, including guy friends because once i get to school i forget what i look like.     and people do look at you when you walk in a room just because its an instinct. like when people walk in a room wouldnt you look out of curiosity?

I have the exact same problem as you do, I've found that Elizabeth Arden is the best (since Napolean gave me acne again!) and I also use Almay 16hr+ foundation make up, if you get drunk and fall asleep, when you wake it's still on, just like you put it on the night before, except your mascara is running and your lipstick is gone.|`|nAvTMXmgaa	Maybellines matte mouse in you shade. or loreal true match.|`|uzYHWdgPaa	clinique all day long, they also have some makeup that's water proof.   and yes to the primer, also try a luminizer to make skin look less fake..  good luck, gorgeous!

Lp4JfVTRaa	it works if you have fine hair|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Yes, it doesn't work at all. Big waste of money, don't bother.|`|ABOvm38Caa	I've only tried it  for the peach fuzz on my cheeks and above my upper lip.

It took me half an hour to do one leg, and that wasn't perfectly. You are better off not buying it.
972LCOk4aa	because shaving doesnt get rid of the hair thats in your roots, only the hair on top of the roots. you cant do anything to get rid of it but try waxing, waxing gets rid of the hair in the roots to so you have no bumps|`|qqEw3mQmaa	before and in between shaving you should exfoliate. this will remove the dead skin over the open pores from shaving give you less bumps ....Always use a fresh razor, and shave cream, no soap. good luck!

AA10515207	1. Soak feet in warm water. Use pumice stone (available in pharmacies, or beauty sections of Target, Wal-Mart) to get rid of calluses & dead skin. Rub in a foot cream like Aveeno. Do this before bed & wear socks @ night after using cream to help softening process.    2. Walk or swim--the 2 best overall exercises there are. Next best is jumping rope. You can do this in an uncluttered garage.    3. If you're dark-haired, dark-complected your underarm hair will be dark. Keep shaving to keep it in control so you don't have stubble. After showering put some body lotion on to keep area moist. A roll-on deodorant might work.    4. Nothing is symmetrical on a human's body. I have one boob smaller, one leg shorter, & one earlobe thicker. Buying the right bra & adjusting it will help.    5.Wash well w/ a soap like Ivory, pat--don't rub--& apply an over-the-counter product. Works as well as the expensive stuff. Never go to bed w/ make-up on.    6. If you lose weight, your face will lose weight as well.    7. See a previous question you asked. You had @ least 3 really good answers.    8.See  7.    9. There are creams you can buy that supposedly lighten the circles. I have this problem & they didn't work for me. See about a good concealer.    Hey! I was worried about you. You're usually upbeat & that one ? was uncharacteristic of you. Can I help it if I worry about my friends?|`|ncPdftafaa	damn girl what you tryna be? PERFECT?  stick to normal things.  like  clearin your face, working out, and trying a new hairstyle and you'll be good.|`|fLDEHFKJaa	1: Try Ped Egg. You can find it at Wal-Mart and it easily takes away the scruffies on your feet!  2. Excersie regularly. It really does help if you eat well. Don't resort to diet pills until you are older. They can seriously mess up your system.  3. They make bleach that you can use on body hair. It just lightens the hairs and makes them harder to see. Look for it near the shaving things at your local supermarket  4. I have the same problem. Most people don't even notice until you say something! Guys don't even really mind either. One king sized and one fun sized! I wouldn't suggest surgery, it's costly and has side effects. Don't resort to pills or things until you're older, but people also say that when you start lactating, they will fill out. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT SAY I SAID TO GET PREGNANT! I AM NOT ADVOCATING TEEN PREGNANCY!  5. Proactive does stink. Try clean and clear or biore products. Biore has some facial clensing complexion cloths that really do work wonders!  6. I think facial chub goes away with the rest of the body fat. slowly and gradually.  7. You could try invisiline.... but if your teeth are pretty much straight, don't spend the extra money on fixing them. it's not worth 2 to 5 thousand dollars to try to fix if it's fine.  8. Not sure about that one. It just might be a personal quirk  9. Try a dab of concealer on the dark circles and blending it in. If that doesn't work as well as projected, try a product that garnier makes. It's an eye roller that has natural caffine in it that gets rid of baggy and dark eyes.    Don't forget to love yourself for who you are and your own little personal quirks!  http://www.campaignforrealbeauty.com/    B|`|cjnBs0h6aa	exercise, dentist, dermatologist  and a   psychologist for thinking you need so much work..|`|tLXD3yOWaa	1) go to a place like sally's and they will have wax that peels off dead skin and gradually will make feet softer  2)switch from beef to turkey meat (less fattening) eat 3 light meals a day with a light fruit snack in between exercise 30 mins a day 3 days of the week  3)nothing i know of sorry :(  4)honey you are only 15 yrs old and are still growing! give it time and your breasts will even out  5)i use clean and clear system...never had bad acne but when i did get the occasional pimple it cleared up quickly  6)yes your face is normally the first place that you lose weight  7)retainer or braces are the only way to go to sculpt teeth  8)idk what tmj is so sorry  9)concealer i recommend mac foundation line or cover girl true blend|`|utivEuTfaa	1) Get some body butter from Bath & Body Works, and every night before bed, rub it on your heels and put socks over them.  2) The usual...work out, diet...if you're really committed to it then you can do it.   3) Just shave your arms on a regular basis...I don't know if there's a way to reverse the hair growing in dark, but you can maintain it so that it's not noticeable  4) Unfortunately nothing you can do at this point, but you're young still and they can still grow to be the same size.   5) It doesn't sound like your "acne" is anything to worry about...everyone has pimples at your age. But if it bothers you, I'd suggest Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash and/or getting a prescription for acne creams from your doctor.   7) If you don't want/need braces, there's nothing you can really do about this. To make your smile even prettier, Listerine Whitening Rinse works great! Almost as good as professional whitening.  9) Other than maintaining a regular sleep schedule, undereye concealer! After you put that on, put a little foundation over your eyes to make them a similar color as the rest of your face. And always wear mascara, even just a little bit...it makes circles much less noticeable.|`|W4vL2Vycaa	1. lotion  2.exercise and eat right.  5.

I have TMJ too and its really annoying. Im about 11 years older than you and I can tell you that my jaw has gotten a lot better as I have gotten older. I have a few options to fix it completely, like surgery. But you may find it sorts itself out somewhat.    1. Use some good foot lotion! Get a pedi paddle and rub the dead skin off. Slather your feet in moisturiser before bed, put on some cotton sock and overnight the cream will soak in. Works a treat!    2. All teenagers think they are overweight. I actually was when I was your age. By the time I got to 17, I had lost all my puppy fat. Just eat healthy and stay active.    3. Look into gettting your arms waxed.    4. It's normal for one breast to be bigger than the other.     5. You're a teenager, you are meant to have pimples.    6. You will lose the chubby face as you get older.     7. If you get compliments on your teeth, thats a good sign.    9. Get some lightening cream or even go for cooling gels for under your eyes.     Seriously, don't be so hard on yourself. When you get to my age, sh!t like this wont matter!!

JzYlcuXzaa	That probably wasn't a good idea.  Hopefully you sterilized the needle before piercing.  If it becomes distinctively red, go to the doctors.  A buddy of mine went to a shop in the mall to get it done.  Got really infected, after 3 months she's still not healed.  The infection was so bad that it traveled to the right side of her face.  Had an operation and needs to walk around with some sort of machine with her for constant antibiotics to stream through her.  Pretty ugly stuff.|`|XF1y4wMmaa	What I am questioning, is how you made a hole with ice.... JK    It could get infected, Make sure that you clean it often, and dont touch it, Keep your hair out of its way.    I agree, You need a hobby. I love how people just pierce themselves when they are bored....|`|nfYAIDGqaa	it depends on what you used, so it might be infected.  call your doctor, or a medical service and ask.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	You need to clean it regularly and it might not get infected. That's never a good idea though.|`|M6s3jNw6aa	no, you're gonna die !  :O    yeah, it's likely to get infected.|`|WOBAN2iqaa	I pierced my ears with earrings and they didn't get infected. Savlon cream is the best to use on infected peircings but the more you fiddle with it the more it is likely to get infected cos of the germs on your hands. my advice.... find a hobby cos its a bit strange you would do it just cos your "bored"|`|YmVcGSV3aa	it probably will. Dont do that by yourself unless you are trained. It is VERY likely it is infected, go see a doctor!|`|xZo4wP6Faa	how the hell did you manage to 'make a hole' in your cartilage with a piece of ice?  anyways. if you poked a hole through it and didn't stick anything in there, it's not going to get deathly infected and kill you. it'll probably just be sore and heal up in a few days-MAYBE. i got my cartilage piercings done in 6th grade. i'm 22 now and i have been a year without wearing anything in them, and the holes are still there.   anyways-if you did put something in them, i hope it was clean. either way, take it out and wait til you can get it professionally done. screw up a piercing and sometimes they never take right again. clean it with peroxide or bactine or something and don't touch it. geez.

mQk9YR3Maa	if you part it before you blow dry it, and blow dry it toward the left, from the right it'll help it stay.  also apply some hairspray and bobby pin it while you're sleeping, it'll help train them to stay whichever direction you want them to go.|`|0qRV1FJUaa	hairspray or bobby pin, but dont worry it'll grow out and look the way you want it to.|`|9Q8ArnLRaa	bobby pin it|`|RnM4Rr5oaa	a clip|`|JzTg0hg5aa	use a flat iron and then a little bit of hairspray and maybe a bobbypin or two.      good luck [:|`|x3PLREEuaa	"I am completely disgusted by the headlines concerning my sister's weight," Simpson wrote Tuesday on her website.

Or you can use a curling iron, curl the tips, and they will "hold" onto the side of your face. Or you van wear a barette, or headband, ect.|`|AA11664585	it sounds like they need a trim, if you have a normal hairdresser, just run in one day and be like hey can you trim these like super quick, she probably wont charge you but it would be nice to give her like 2 bucks for her time, and generosity.

The aunties all think it is sweet that a gori would want to buy a suit. You will be surprised how much attention you attract.     The suits will not be cheap. I bought a beautiful Ritu Kumar cotton suit on Pioneer a few years ago. Now I buy Ritu Kumar suits online, made to measure, sent to me shipping and all for about half the store price. If it is good enough for Miss India, it is good enough for me.  http://www.ritukumar.com/    One thing though -- always wear the dupatta with the suit. Men will laugh at you if you don't!     While you're there, have a rose lassi and an awesome vegetarian thali at Udipi Palace. Further up the street, almost to the 91, is the best North Indian food in greater LA (ask anyone -- there is consensus) Ambala Dhaba.

3BoZZZajaa	Go to the best salon you can afford and everything will be fine.    Start off slowly by getting blonde streaks first, then when you and everyone else has become adjusted to it, go back and get the lot done. Good luck!|`|OP4O5mjnaa	if youre going to go bleach blonde definitely get it done at a salon. dont even try to do it yourself.  i fried all of my hair having my mom bleach it. it was horrible =( good luck!|`|5SmX1oLlaa	i have dark hair too and i tried every hair color on the market. definitely go to a salon they can get it the way you want. my hair always came out red.|`|hjFAhsbHaa	You would need to bleach it.

I don't know where that got fused into 'punk'.  Ok, as a punk rock chick I'll try to help you out here.  1. DON'T POSE, don't drastically change your appearance.  If she really is a punk rock chick I really think she'll hate that.  2.  WEAR WHATEVER YOU WANT, be it different or the same, wear it if you like it.  You can take the clothing and make it your own however you want.  You could cut it, put pins on it, rip it, put patches on it, but remember only if YOU want to.  Don't do it to impress her do it for yourself or that is really just a contradiction.  3. CLOTHES WON'T GET YOU VERY FAR AT ALL.  You don't know much about the whole 'punk culture' do you?

They're usually around $50|`|711855b069bddf243872284c4bc1bcd9aa	if you live in London you should go to Perfect Image on Richmond Street and have Kyle do it!

Since you are 14, you'll probably have to have your parent(s) with you. For sure have it done professionally, its the only way to go. Good luck, and if my husband would let me get one I totally would!! LOL  Good luck, you will love it!

rSH5lk02aa	well lets see..i havent really had any bad breakouts,but what i do is i use STRIDEX pads or a neutrogena acne product and since you play sports & exercise you should buy like some wet naps or bring your own wet rag and some soap and clean your face with that and then bring or buy stridex pads to your sports game & exercising & clean your face w/the soap and wet rag or wet naps & then clean your face all over with the STRIDEX pads/neutrogena product.  and do the same with your chest...and for your back wash your back in the shower really really well and when you get out get your mom,sister or whoever you can to rub your back with stridex pads/or neutrogena pro. and that should help.  You can buy stridex pads or neutrogena at Wal MArt in the skin care aisle and if u cant find it ask a worker to help you:)  Hope this helped:))!  P.S.u have to use it everytime you get out of the shower.  Good luck:)  OHH and if you use a liquid foundation stop using it and use a Cover girl powder that will match your skin tone..you can find the type of color on the bottom of the compact and you can buy them at walmart also in the makeup aisle:)  Let me know if it worked:)|`|f02fdd44028e78a86a13cf15a8da31e7aa	Also if you are taking medication it can cause breakouts.|`|3KabXG4Iaa	water is the best answer.|`|Zqr4D4Egaa	You should, if you can, shower right after any sort of activity that makes you sweat a lot. Try using a body wash made to clear acne.|`|s3MO348Daa	I suggest when you do your sports have your hair out of the way and  maybe go to a doctor for skin help.    then drink plenty of water before you go to bed and when you wake up, just to get dirty stuff out of your system.    and don't put on coverup!    hope i helped
57LBxeZbaa	Bare Naturale. It makes my skin look airbrushed.|`|MONbNUmkaa	bare mineral is great, but if your on a budget maybelline will give you the same look, but I don't feel that it stays fresh as long.|`|Flrnnme1aa	Mineral Powder the only one I recommend is bee luscious cosmetics mineral pressed powder.    http://www.beeluscious.com|`|LJkPRqN0aa	i like bare mineral.... ive used it for years and love it
Mg6fSXfOaa	My hair is like this too. I have found a few ways to make the frizz and static go away. The most effective way only takes 30 seconds and it only costs $2 at a drugstore.  I have found Garnier Fructis sleek and shine anti- frizz serum to work VERY well. after you take a shower, or get your hair wet, just apply a little bit to your hands and massage it in. After that, dry/style your hair like normal, and your hair will be static free for the whole day!    Hope this helped!!!|`|8wWPmytSaa	use a dryer sheet and just grib your hair with it and your hair will no longer be staticy    it works for me and my friends|`|r172u0P8aa	i had the same exact problem! i believe its caused from the dry winter hair.  My sister told me to spay some "Static Guard" on your hair brush, then brush your hair. It works great! I bought it in CVS, its not found in the hair products aisle because its really used for clothing, so i would suggest asking someone that works there.  I also suggest trying switching conditioners, i realized that that was what was causing my static-y hair, and once i switched it was gone.    HOPE THIS HELPS =]
2qb5pSjFaa	noooo|`|PFBKuVhBaa	ddooooo noooot  get the eyebrow done  lip piercings are hot anyways  plus with an eyebrow piercing it'll distract from those perdy eyes  :D|`|2wOmBTPyaa	Eyebrow.

And I like guys with piercings. But you look perfectly fine without them. But whatever you do DON'T get your eyebrow pierced. They aren't attractive and they can cause your brow to sag. But do get your lip pierced. That would be hot. Just take very good care of it! Clean it with Bactine, turn it every day, and rinse your mouth out with Listerine after every time you eat. Then it will heal perfectly and quick. Hope I helped you out hun. :]|`|38GEhj3iaa	Your hot. I think a facial piercing would ruin your looks. You look great how you are now :)|`|P7fpW3mTaa	Lip piercing.

An eyebrow piercing would look good too though.|`|JKKR67M9aa	I dot think either will suit. You have a realy unique spunky look. If you want a piercing i suggest getting your tongue or nipple done so they dont take the attention from your eyes.

feyZ3bkBaa	Maybelline Mineral Power. It's not over priced and it's very light.|`|3b73cc5bf948386f5b508e34a099b497aa	I REALLY recommend Bare Minerals.    I like it because that one little tub lasts at LEAST 6 months, and I use it EVERYDAY without fail, so if it last 180 days, its only 7 cents a day. I think thats totally worth it. Its so light and natural looking, but it still conceals any redness or blemishes and gives you a great dewy look that makes you look so fresh! My skin has improved so much since I started using it. It stays on all day long but comes off with just a little bit of water (no soap!)    I tried maybelline hoping it would be at least CLOSE to the same but I was totally disappointed, It looked like I put orange tinted body glimmer on my face and it didnt even conceal any blemishes.    Bare minerals is BEYOND worth it!|`|HypPc34Baa	I use Jane Iredale and it is a powder. It covers any blemishes very well, and is really good for your skin.|`|AA12133586	prescriptive mineral foundation|`|1HJwuQhAaa	i use everyday minerals. i like it because..    it looks natural and not fake or cakey    its light and i dont feel like im wearing makeup    theres so many shades of foundation and blush and bronzers and all sorts of finishing powders its easy to find your exact skin shade    it stays on for a long time and doesnt look oily    its a lot cheaper than bare minerals and much better because it doesnt contain TALC which is known to break people out    they have amazing brushes! they are soooo soft and make the makeup go on perfectly.    try it!!|`|s6qPzTgEaa	I have tried many different products for cover up and foundation and now I stick to covergirl.   it last and covers very well!  I use a liquid base and then some cover up and put powder on after to hold it.

BNSszOAuaa	I wouldn't worry about it. First, it's not like it changes who you are because of a few scars. Nobody gets to keep the skin they're born with because hormones, stress, aging. (and sometimes weather) of chaotic lives take over.    Your family will love you the same, the scars don't sound that noticeable, etc.    Walgreen's, CVS, and other pharmacies haveprecription medicine that can be greatfully helpful. A dermatologist could give the refferal/prescription. the most powerful and successful "scar masks" that can be found without a precription will be in the section with the facial stuff/acne facial cleansing pads. I don't know any name brands in paticular but they are reliable.    Also, aloe vera sometimes works on scars. It doesn't always but at times it does. Just rub a bit on the scars and they will temporarily fade a bit.    Don;t worry about it, though.    Everyone has scars, don't feel bad.|`|OapXbjbSaa	defiantly Try proactive i had a  same problem for 1 and half yr and i tried all kind of herbs and prescription medication but didn't work at all  try proactive u will see difference in couple weeks but use it twice a day  best of luck !!!!!|`|6S2TmSJQaa	oh my gosh do i have the same thing!  my friend saw it or at least i told her  about it and shes like try dandriff  shampoo it helps your hair and especially  backne well i havent tried it yet but, i would  my friends like a beauty expert so try that:D

Upper ear has been done 15 years and you can NOT see the hole (but it never grew up) inner cartilage takes 6 mo to heal and WILL show a hole when no ear rings are in. (not bad though)|`|6nzUpXXyaa	It will leave a little hole like scar at first but later it should be fine. Maybe it will leave a little dimple. It will def leave a little bump you can feel, but most likely cant see.|`|HALNhYyzaa	I had to take mine out or a new job about two years ago and the hole never closed.  It wasn't visible but the hole was still there cuz i recently put a hoop in it just to see if it was still there after 2 years and it was.  But it also depends on how big the hole is and how long ago you got it done.|`|2nBiEe6paa	It actually can depend on a lot of things. For instance:    If the piercing is professionally done with a needle rather than a gun, it minimizes scarring and other complications, thus making the hole much less detectable.    Also it can completely depend on your body.    Lastly even if the hole does not close, it is rather difficult to tell that it was ever there unless you were looking for it, provided you keep a small gauge in.|`|YgjAXcm3aa	the question for you is, how long of a tim period are we talking about?  there are two possibilities, the cartilage itself will not close up but there is a possibility that the skin will close around the hole..  the other question is.. how big of a piercing are we talking?  the size of the hole and time period are both varying factors  in your conundrum. however im sure that there is a good percentage that the hole will close without a problem..  but! before you peirce your cartilage, think of the possibility of infection! and where there's infection there is also a  possibility of disease. so yea its not just that you should think about.  but.....it looks like you got a 60-40 chance that things will turn out in your favor.|`|1J3K7Mdbaa	I had my cartilage twice and one of them fell out about a week after I had it pierced. It closed up. Now, you can feel the hole on the back of my ear slightly, but can't see it at all. I reccommend this piercing! Although, quite painful. Yes, they close quite easily.

4ced7bdccd5ac69d26e351b14088fa50aa	Think of it logically.     When you tan, you tan the top layer of skin on in. I don't know about 'smooth away', but I do know that if you shave your legs you take off the top layer of dead skin. The one you just tanned.     A good tan consists of exfoliation and moisturizing. It may take you longer to achieve a tan, but its worth it, and it will last longer. Tan, shave, exfoliate, and moisturize...and after you have a good tan, put a self tanner over it to get an optimal glow.|`|5AReOy38aa	if its an exfoliant then yes. exfoliating takes off the top layers of the skin which removes the tan. another example of this is shaving...shaving lightens your tan also.|`|AA11664585	yes because when you tan you are burning the top layers of your skin, and when you use the smooth away you are exfoliating those top layers away!   that's why you aren't even supposed to shave for like 24 hours after you tan!|`|O96fzxi0aa	no, i don't think so

UByvC54Xaa	They will get thinner for the first few months as the dread "tightens". Then they will start to thicken up a little as old hair falls out (it still stays in the dread) and new hair grows into the dread aswell.    For thinner dreads, section your hair into 1/2 inch squares. For thicker - up to 1 and 1/2 inch squares.    If they are too thin, you can group some dreads together and weave them in and out of each other - eventually they grow as one dread and at the same time, if you have really thick dreads, you can carefully rip them apart. Just dont let them get too thin as the hair at the roots will not be strong enough to support the weight of the dread and they will snap at the roots.|`|AA11664585	they can both ways, if you let them come together, they can get huge, like 5 on you whole head, lol  but if you keep them separated, you can have a bunch of little ones

pnHkFv5iaa	I don't like vans. But I like my Chucks. They're like green patchwork plaid. And they have a nice silhouette to them. Make my feet look good. Especially with skinny jeans. They're very versatile shoes.    But if you just wear them with like, light wash jeans, and a matching tee, well, that just takes all the fun out of them.|`|AA11560862	I love them for thier comfort and how they can look good with almost any casual outfit.|`|QY385UQ0aa	im personally not a fan of converse but i love vans  my reason is that they are just very comfortable  plain and simple is what i like =]|`|I59dkJksaa	nothing one cool person started wearin em- so everybody hav to follow|`|cNBN4DNtaa	they can match with just about every outfit. but idk why people like vans, i think vans are ugly.|`|gLXzVbm8aa	super comfortable|`|7mmmGytpaa	they're just classic shoes i guess? i don't know anyone that lOves them though...
iMiN8OnDaa	Some things weren't meant to be piecered...    Everyone reacts diffrently to pain. You probaly will be fine becuase you said that didn't hurt.|`|9j7sw02Faa	when u get your tongue peirced it doesn't hurt at all.  Afterwards when it is swollen it hurt.  i have mine pierced.|`|wQEVpe7zaa	Hi! The most important thing is that you sit still. When I got mine done, I didn't feel a thing AT ALL. They hold your tongue pretty tight with the forceps so you can't move it, that's the only thing I remember feeling.     Good luck! :)|`|W7DhZSy3aa	it will be fine, i got mine done but its annoying to be constantly biting on it while i chew my food, it got annoying so i took it out, it dosent hurt when they do it but it will be swollen and soar for a couple weeks, and you cant smoke, or do ''other things'' that could cause infection. its up to you, good luck.|`|xZo4wP6Faa	If you had a baby with no drugs then piercings should not be a problem. Piercings of any kind. I say this with baby-having experience, and several piercings experience. :) My tongue ring barely hurt at all during the actual piercing. In fact it hurt so little I decided to play with it the entire 45 minutes ride home and paid for it that whole next week--my tongue was super swollen, I was drooling and lisping, it was a mess. Not to mention I was waitressing so I had to explain to my customers why I was trying not to drool and lisping. Looking back now it's funny but then it was horrible, I was miserable and in pain. So, long story short, you should be fine, just don't play with it :)
vV9FyHxXaa	I am going to pick a random number...  Undershirts: 4.  Pants: 3.  Shoes:1  Accessories:2,4,6,8,10  Under your pants:2  Hair: 1  Hoodie: 3|`|AA11560862	Oh boy...I will have fun!  Undershirt numero 5  Pants number 3  Shoes number 4  Necklaces number 10, 12, 13  Underpants number 2  Hair number 2  Hoddie number 2      What was the bet about anyways????|`|SdJEVO53aa	go naky|`|ivUPlEwDaa	I think that this is somehow for your sick pleasure, but whatever.    Undershirts - Number 2  Pants - Number 1  Shoes - Whichever look best with red, they all sound ugly  Accesories - Numbers 1, 2, and 3  Underwear - Number 3  Hair - Ew - CUT IT!  Hoodie - Number 1, 2, or 3, doesn't ,matter
uisC37Efaa	Hey sweetie<br>  I had dyed orange hair not too long ago, and my skin isn't super pale either..<br>  <br>  Some looks that look great on red heads are<br>  <br>  A BROWN smokey eye (not black, its too intense)<br>  -Using brown eyeliner, line your eyes around the lash lines. Then grab a brown eyeshadow and just blend it over your entire eyelid. Use a darker brown in the outer corner of both your lower and upper lash line.<br>  <br>  A thin line of green, blue or purple on your top lashline, and half way across your bottom lashline (I know you said no purple, but it really does look great on red heads as its a contrasting colour, and if you only use a thin line it wont look like you got punched in the eye.. heh)<br>  - Use a thin, slanted eye shadow brush for this and just draw a line along the top of your lash line. For a more intense colour, wet the brush before dipping it in the eyeshadow and apply. You can also do a little cat-eye flick with this which looks extra cool =]<br>  <br>  As for mascara, use brown if you are wearing very natural eye makeup, and use black if you are doing something a bit more intense.<br>  Same goes for eyeliners.<br>  <br>  Foundation and powder.. just get one to match your skin colour and type (eg oily, dry, combination, normal...) PLEASE don't use too much foundation, only use just enough to make your skin look even and cover up any blemishes with concealer - only using it on the red area as needed. I can't even begin to stress how terrible girls look with lots of foundation on, you want to look naturally beautiful, not fully made up!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|dxpAcsG5aa	black eyeliner fersure.<br>  :)<br>  but not like... super heavy.<br>  eyeshadow should be natural and light, nothing that pops out too much because your hair does that for you. so naturals, white, pale yellow, black (if your going for that smokey eye thing).<br>  mascara; umm.... any kind that you like. if you're wearing black eyeliner, you should also wear black mascara. (i like the cover girl kind in the purple tube)<br>  powder; i'm more of a liquid person. (true blend works amazingly.)<br>  but, not the loose powder, it just gets everywhere. use a compact. <br>  now about lips....<br>  lip glosses: clear, pale pink, nude, etc. not bright red - you'll look like you've come out of a 30's movie.<br>  lip stick: same rule as lip gloss. no. bright. red.<br>  hope this helps.<br>  :)|`|CLimAej6aa	ayy(:<br>  i think you would look really good just these things:<br>  1)some light foundation or tinted moisturizer(just apply it everywhere, but not too much)<br>  2)some transparent loose powder( just use a big blush brush to sweep it all over ur face) <br>  3)a thin line of brown or black eyeliner(i like black better)on ur water line<br>  4)a bit of golden eyeshadow or any shimmery light color<br>  5)maybe a peachy or light pink blush applied to the apples of ur cheeks(smile really big!! (: )<br>  6) a light pink or clear lip gloss<br>  hope this helps(:<br>  ?
L5161047aa	well its probably still adjusting, because you went up with a ring, its probably at a very little curve so that's one reason.<br>  and it might be too short, so get a longer 16g stud.
pv7XYLELaa	It's probably the length of the stud, go buy a longer one so you give your lip room.|`|8lwGjvQpaa	get a 85 gram ring|`|hBszEO3Maa	If it don't hurt then leave it. An advantage of having it a little bit tight is that it will protect ur gums. The constant rubbing on the gums from talking, chewing etc, will take it's toll over the years.<br>  If it's too tight it will indent the inside of ur lip, some people live with it others don't.|`|24sK6L2uaa	Its the length not the gauge that is giving you the tightness.
7tRTZhnLaa	I number 2 best but they are both really pretty!|`|yfPu5pcZaa	I like the first one much more. But you have to have a really flat tummy for a dress like that. The blue one is nice but I just feel that there are nicer and more unique colors. Black isn't unique but it's classic.|`|UHjXC1Jhaa	the black one|`|0c44c557b5bc5a2df5e3cbbcf028239baa	1. <a href="http://www.lafemmefashion.com/collection..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lafemmefashion.com/collection...</a>|`|BUzrs76Baa	I LOVE THE SECOND|`|QW4jdXGjaa	the first one.|`|FHQZz8dNaa	I already know you got enough answers for this question. I honestly say the black one. The cut  on the blue one on the back is WAY too much, the color is gorgeous though. I honestly don't like either I think you can do WAY better, the dresses are too cliche, here's another idea for you to have a unique dress:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.unique-vintage.com/delightful-petal-like-prom-dress-p-3233.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-vintage.com/delightful...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.unique-vintage.com/kate-winslet-2009-oscars-inspired-gown-faviana-p-3239.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-vintage.com/kate-winsl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.unique-vintage.com/1950s-style-black-silver-illusion-mesh-prom-dress-p-3206.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-vintage.com/1950s-styl...</a>  My personal FAVORITE!!!!!!|`|Lp4JfVTRaa	the second one is nicer|`|9Dxzvr4Paa	i like the second one better. the color is really pretty and the beading is cute also. Very cute dress!!!!|`|N2IfNEm0aa	2 the cut is gorgeous and the color is especially eye catching...|`|XbjEPe81aa	2.|`|Sv0SV0E1aa	The first one, its always more classy. The second looks too mermaidish lol.|`|kLXls4Oraa	The first one, but they are both really pretty!|`|QLC16aRCaa	first looks WAY more chic.... the second one has a weird fit|`|CrPqSqpeaa	it depends on your skin tone, color of your hair, everything, i personally cant decide which outfit/clothes or what ever people ask on here because i cant tell which looks better until i see it on the person<br>  <br>  but i do like the second dress better, just because of the pretty blue :)|`|XbxZR2nGaa	Neither. I like this one.|`|lCoiqgpFaa	definetly the 2nd 1<br>  it has a gorgeous color!|`|ujgQQG6Gaa	I say the black one if you want to be suttle but the blue one if you want to be out there!! :D|`|V3Msj4dWaa	2.<br>  I love the color and cut !|`|8b364392d0522c3c2402469363363901aa	the second one is gorgeous!<br>  the color will pop on any skin tone!|`|ePI3z0SBaa	number 1|`|4iHBjNizaa	the first one is a little ----. definitely choose the second one!|`|gjMVvN5xaa	the 2nd one looks better to me|`|8icAwbqBaa	they are both very pretty i would go wit the 2nd one :)|`|9bn5cNwXaa	The first one.|`|0WKW8alraa	first one.|`|Q2eNvAubaa	both pretty but the 1st one!!!|`|hAkeSmleaa	second one. <br>  first ones cute too tho:)
EroXBvDNaa	no|`|YNVNnI0haa	no not at all  I am 220 and only 5 foot 9 1/2 inches and I am shaped perfectly.  You are too  You are considered a normal weight.|`|rurfFLDkaa	yea just a little bit tho..lose 10-20 and ull be good|`|TYRRjIv4aa	According to your body weight calculator you are considered normal. Congrats! Do not worry :) and here is the website to confirm: http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/|`|gVQZUmLfaa	lol no you're perfectly normal weight!    Going by the Body Mass Index calculator your BMI is 22.2 which falls under normal :)        *  Underweight =       * Normal weight = 18.5-24.9      * Overweight = 25-29.9      * Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater|`|jsCjGUPuaa	heck no i am 5'8 and more than u... i no that i am not big at all but than again it depends on how u hold ur weight. if u want to loose weight go ahead but u r still in healthy weight and defenatly not fat|`|56eAArieaa	yes lose 10|`|qlNf1ZyFaa	maybe just a little  im 5 feet 6 3/4 inches and im 111|`|z2zZCJDRaa	Personally I can't say. I'm five five and 110 and I would like to lose twenty pounds to fit in with the rest of my friends. So do whatever you think is right.|`|SdJEVO53aa	no, its perfectly normal, espessialy if u have some muscle, im 5''8 152.6
NBLmYWRBaa	try this  a hair twist crown  part your hair down the center  take a small to medium amount of hair on one side, twist towards ur head, and securly pin back.  then, do the same on the other side.  heres a pic  http://trend911.com/wp-content/1conrad_4...  i know lc had wavy hair, but mine is pin straight and it looks really good. (put ur bangs in if you have any)  i think it would look good!|`|zYdi5UeIaa	down striget|`|8oPVcYSyaa	IF I WERE I I WOULD, COMB IT STRAIGHT DOWN AND THEN BRING THE ENDS OF MY HAIR UP, AND PUT A PIN IN IT, ABOUT TO 2 INCHES.|`|AmIjqLQDaa	go curly makes you stand out     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAZWmBhWw...
LaJn6jxJaa	Something like this would look cute.  Probably not this blonde and maybe a little longer, but I hope you can get the main idea of what I'm saying.  http://www.hairstyles-haircuts.net/wp-co...|`|A2byxpHDaa	you have like the exact same hair as me;)|`|yHWkQs9Paa	http://www.prohaircut.com/nicole-richie-...  http://www.prohaircut.com/Taylor_Momsen_...  http://www.prohaircut.com/sraight-hairst...  http://www.prohaircut.com/jenna-jameson-...
AA12196812	Bipolarwhoree (You wouldn't believe what that name could mean in English! But I digress).  If your face is a circle, cut it short! Make it really very very wispy, so it'd all go in these spikes, you'll look very cute and it's so easy to maintain! You can leave your bangs really long and cut at an angle. Then just apply some gel or pomade or whatever the hairstylist recommends - it'l stay good and you'll look really cute.    Just make sure that the stylist cuts it so that you have much volume on tope of your head and very little on the sides - that will visually elongate the face; also leave some strands of hair to go onto your face from the side.|`|adIPqtm4aa	color ur hair depend on ur face, and make ur hair curley not too much a slitly curly like beyonce u will have look trust me|`|dqe30Pciaa	my hair is like that lol.  try getting it in layers on the side then kind of flipping them out|`|I59dkJksaa	keep the haier long because shorter hair is NOOO god with a circular face-uh i would get llke ur hair layer-3 seperate ones(make sure to tell the hairdresser u want it a little longa in the back either wise it will look like a bowl on top of ur head haha! and uh get bangs trimmed to da side and bout hlf an inch above ur eyebrows|`|0dPEelS0aa	http://tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:OFcZ...    cheek these out    http://tbn0.google.com/images?q=tbn:RIlg...|`|AA12074772	With a round face shape shorter  side bangs look really GREAT!! along with hair a little bit above your shoulders...that is o a really amazing haircut for someone with a round face.  I did that and got a lot of complements|`|YODuu4kMaa	Just cut 2-3 inches off plus your bangs and that's about all you can do
TrIPTjYZaa	with less is better<br>  either way, you are still pretty :) <br>  and i read your answer/comment in <br>  the other question and OMG! <br>  that makes you even more prettier!<br>  you're pretty inside and out and that <br>  makes me so jealous. ^-^|`|Ajz5hyXJaa	i think you are very gorgeous both ways and u have a great complexion. either way looks good without the makeup you could save more money to get other things like a new outfit or something<br>  so id choose the less makeup one <br>  oh yeah love the peace thing and ur nose rings kicks ***|`|feoyRAAvaa	i think you are freakishly pretty with both. sometimes its good to switch it up. on somedays wear more makeup than others to not be boring. not many people can pull off a septum ring, and you can, so if you like the way it looks than, WORK IT! you are gifted haha.|`|TOQCzm9Caa	the septum ring looks really fake, photoshop?<br>  and don't wear so much make-up.<br>  :)<br>  <br>  you're way prettier wearing less!|`|V3Msj4dWaa	You look great with not much on! (Not a lot of girls can pull that off)<br>  And your septum ring looks better off .|`|jtC16IgFaa	I DONT LIKE THE RING, IT SCARY!<br>  <br>  AND I LIKE IT WITH MORE MAKEUP!<br>  <br>  <br>  I BET YOU STOLE THOSE PICS.|`|UYnCFSvhaa	no its nice just the nose ring is horrible|`|cJYVXmwHaa	oh, sweetie you look like an unhappy midget.... ease up on the Mascara|`|CnHIHCwtaa	less|`|Fb5SRq25aa	less|`|QfYGhtVwaa	The thing in your nose in really ugly.<br>  <br>  Your makeup and eyelashes are great, but with the barbie hair - almost too much.  <br>  <br>  Is your head really that big in comparison to your body?!, I laughed - sorry - if so, you really need to tuck into some healthy high calorie foods!|`|77NzfiVkaa	I think you look beautiful the way you are, with the septum ring and the makeup. I can tell that it's your personality coming through and your personal creativity. I like it a lot.|`|M4zfLQTNaa	I think you should not put mascara on your bottom lashes because it looks weird..and I'm sorry the septem ring creeps me out..<br>  :)  you are a gorgeous girl!|`|JoAfcy4Caa	sorry i dont like the ring u look lovely both ways- try getting a ring at the side of your nose it loos great i have 1 too.|`|CktiV6KJaa	I love your face.<br>  Any way is fine.<br>  <br>  Just take that f*cking thing out of your nose.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	no septum ring and less makeup. you're so pretty!|`|vWOuX1d5aa	You look way more natural without much makeup.<br>  Stick with less because boys dont like girls who wear TOO much makeup.

UtTv0we8aa	I am pretty tall for my age and I don't mind its not great but its not that bad|`|JsR4ypomaa	im 5'9 and i occassionally hate it, i dont think its unattractive but it sucks when every guy you like is shorter than you.|`|gPvhZDI7aa	i am a tall girl...like 5'10 and i like it. the only bad part is i cant wear heels. but its awesome in bball. it really depends how u carry urself. if ur clumsy and weird when u walk and ur tall----awkward. if u walk confident and put together---attractive. theres 2 other really tall girls in my grade one is super awkward--fumbly and long and librarians kid...the other wins beauty pageants all the time|`|jViaS1rSaa	i think all of this definately depends on the person. for instance there is a very tall girl who i know who is very stick figure like and akward but then there's this other girl who is curvy and friendly and pretty.  i like my height (almost 5' 2") because im always shorter than guys which makes it easier to date but then i dont think short legs and a short torso is very attractive. i feel short and squat sometimes. then at other times i feel like im an average height.  overall i think no matter what height there are always pros and cons.

meisgiZBaa	pray|`|8MVrUtbAaa	Hair extensions, manicure, Dr. Georges teeth whitener (the BESST) and Benzaclin acne medication. Worked for me in one week :) best of luck!  xoxo|`|OAo5t5FRaa	u seriously need a miracle|`|Afmv2WYSaa	Clip in hair extensions. Crest whitening strips. either grow out your nails or glue on fake nails. No pimples- make sure you wash your face twice a day with a gentle clenser and exfoliate ones a week.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Um, I kind of don't think that is possible.    Hair and nails: Buy biotin, I heard it grows these both, you can buy this at any store, or you could buy it online for cheap at www.vitacost.com    Whiter Teeth: Do not use peroxide or baking soda everyday because it can destroy at the lining it your mouth, you can use Crest White strips, brushing after every meal, drinking less caffeine.    Pimples: Buy facial wash, wash your face with a mild soap at night before you go to bed to remove dirt and oil from your face from the day. Also drink you 8 to 10 glasses of water which is 64 oz each day. If you are going to drink 8 glasses, since 1 cup equals 8 oz of water then that would be 8 times a day. Water washes the toxins and oil out of your body when you pee it out. When you don't drink this water, that oil needs to leave your body so it exits through our skin, and that is where we get pimples. So drinking water will avoid this.    Good Luck|`|68tZ5fmWaa	If you already have the date, I'm sure he likes you just the way you are. So if you don't accomplish some of this, don't sweat it and just have a great time.|`|6a60fc76b51aaef7e6e9051ad2ad4d85aa	for longer hair you can get extensions  longer nails, don't cut/bite them and they will have alot by 2 weeks and then you could always get them done up nicely  for whiter teeth go to cosmetic dentist for teeth whitening or you can buy teethwhitening mouth wash. avoid caffeine as it stains your teeth  and for no pimples clease and tone everyday, use only mineral makeup and if your really desperate get a prescription from your doctor for acne    lol, hope your date goes well|`|JkpyLnfDaa	i agree with the previous answers (:  dont stress!  extensions (clip in or glue)   dont cut your nails, or just get your nails done!  Crest Whitestrips Premium are perfect for like short time periods  and just be sure to wash your face with an astrigent twice a day, and if you can i say try the neutrogena wave, it helps soo much  or if you have a chunk of change to spare a Zeno is the most amazing thing for pimples    hope this helps|`|SZiLawWXaa	Easy:    Longer hair: Use Head and Shoulders, scrub your scalp real good and rinse your hair. By scrub, I mean really scrub good so follicles in your hair can breath, thus allowing your scalp more room to breathe, you'll also get extra volume!    Longer nails: The only way you can make your nails longer  (from what I've known) is to get sick because in the process of fighting off bacteria, your body is also making your nails grow longer, but DON'T do that! 14 years is a long time so just wait for it to grow.    Whiter teeth: Get 3 parts baking soda and mix it with 1 part water, use that as toothpaste. It will taste salty, but keep scrubbing your teeth like you normally do, rinse it out and you should see your teeth stains go away.    No pimples: Everyday after you sleep, use that baking soda for whitening your teeth and use it as a mask. Leave for 10 minutes (If it is burning, it means it doing it's job of getting rid of the oils in your face), then wash with cold water.    You can also do the 10 minute rule with Lemons for whitening your face or Tomatoes which is a great exfoliant. Good luck with VDay.
MGDNl4Qsaa	From what I've been hearing and seeing in magazines SHORT hair is in! Bobs and pixie cuts are supposedly going to be in style this year.

sokzKmtiaa	If your going red..your gonna have to always re-dye your hair which will damage it beyond belief...if you want a nearly permanent color that won't wash out and wont screw your hair up, I'd use henna,you can achieve ANY color with henna and indigo...any red,orange,brown you want..AND it doesnt screw your hair up (it makes it nice and shiny)   Don't completely rip her color and cut off tho, thatd be bogus..create your own red =] good luck    p.s If you decide to use henna make sure its body art quality.    pps.I think ashlee sismpson has a similar shade of red to that one..|`|Ul1OCP8Iaa	http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/h...

rgNP0Qo6aa	ALL of that? probably around $10,000 honestly    Okay... science answer:    You grow in at least 80% of your hair during puberty. When you have laser hair removal the hairs it kills will never grow again. But you still have up to 20% of your normal thickness that will grow in throughout the rest of your life. So people get touch up sessions every 3-5 years after their big 6 treatments. You need about 6 treatments, one each 2 months for a year, because the hair grows in different stages and it can only kill hair in the active growth stage. The laser works by targeting dark color (the hair follicle) and passing through light color (the skin) the hair and skin have to be very different shades of color for the hair to work. The darker and coarser the hair and lighter the skin, the better results you will have.    Okay... Personal Experience:    I've had 2 out of my 6 treatments so far. It HURTS! It's like being poked with a sewing needle over and over, but it's not as painful as a tattoo, and that's not as painful as childbirth, maybe that can put the pain in perspective for you =) I've had my legs, underarms, and bikini area done. When you get your bikini area done they do ALL of it! Including spreading your butt and vaginal lips apart to laser all the cracks... It's sorta awkward. After the 2 treatments I've had so far I've lost about 60% of leg hair, 40% bikini hair, and 25% underarms hair. It's because the underarms hair is the thinnest and the leg hair is the coarsest. But the legs are the most painful. The more it hurts the better it works.  I spent this much for 6 treatments in each area:  Bikini-$750  Underarms-$750  Legs (toes to bikini)-$2,500    Email me if you have any more questions about it!

Also, have a chat with a hairdresser about what hair care products are suitable for your hair type and perhaps even a nice trim, cut or colour might help.  Join weight watchers, they're really good!! As for what you wear, don't worry too much about it, as you lose weight and your hair and skin improve, you will feel better about yourself and you may even want to change your image to suit the way you feel.

If you want formal wear a shrug.|`|db66fc70a6a89edc4973a377afc4fb0baa	well I would wear a cute little shrug with the white dress. Oh and the white is what i would choose. Get a little shrug in a cute/pastel color that goes to the cinshed part. That way it still looks like a dress and not just a skirt with a sweater for a top.|`|TYRRjIv4aa	I think a basic cardigan would work and they come in a ray of colors that would work well with the white dress. I think you should go with the white dress and maybe a red, light blue, black or pink cardigan.|`|zjZvJJLpaa	If its at night time, go for the black! It looks more sophisticated and black looks great on everybody. If its during the day time though, I'd stick to the white. Also, since its formal, you might want to look for a similar dress but in a nicer material. Cotton makes clothes look casual. As for a sweater, I would go for something with a great black and white print on it for the black dress and a nice floral print for the white in maybe a maroon color. Either way, make sure its not to plain since the dress is a solid. This one has a nice look to it and would work with whatever color you decide on: http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...|`|385b5c9d7cdef8d18d881b50a9b24b0faa	you might disagree, but i would go with the white or red/burgundy.  white, because it's a church event and you can put almost any color with it to make it look good.  burgundy because i just like it haha.    if you're getting the white dress, i'd suggest a gray or pink or yellow cardigan with heels matching the cardi.  if you're getting the red dress, i'd suggest a gray or yellow cardigan.    i wanna be in the fashion industry someday :D|`|YTOrDW3haa	actually i love the purple or the light gray! with either of those i would wear maybe like a white sweater or if you have a mini jean jacket would look really cute too! i think the white would look cuter, if you definitely want white or black.

I hate when people try to look like someone else. Your hair is your own hair and you will never look just like the person you are trying to look like. You hair will curl different or frame you face different. Your face is probably shaped different or your hairline is different. But you can decide long or short, bangs or no bangs, and see what your hair can do for you. Don't try to see what Silver's hair can do for you.  But it looks like she just has long side bangs and slightly wavy hair.

I really want to do my bangs like hers.    The girl in question, Jessica Stroup, also has hair that's a bit wavy.    If you want your hair straighter, I suggest a keratin treatment. It's changed my life. It's also good for your hair. I don't even have to blow dry it now (I've done it 2x) and I have very thick wavy hair.    And I have not used a flat iron since.

OuaUAAZlaa	i think you were more correct in saying that you are used to seeing yourself with the mascara.  :)    the probability that your lashes are falling out/thinning because of the mascara is very unlikely.  however, if you truly feel that they are thinning, dont use the mascara for a little while.  it takes about 2 weeks for your eyelashes to grow back, so wait 2 weeks and see if they appear to be normal.  if youre still concerned after 2 weeks, see a dermatologist.    if you want to make your eyes stand out, you can take a very thin eyeliner (like Physicians Formula Eye Definer Automatic Eye Pencil) to the outer corner of your upper eyelid and draw a thin line curling out and up from your eyelid. i wouldnt go too far out with the line or make the curl too curly (unless of course you want to).  if done correctly, this will give the effect of longer lashes and open up the eye.  another trick is to highlight your brow by applying a light nude-colour eyeshadow (or an off white) very lightly right under your eyebrow along the arch.  this will brighten the eye area, making your eye area look more rested.  if you really want to use a little bit of mascara, apply it only to the eyelashes on the outer corner of your upper lid.    if youre thinking about switching mascaras, i really like Too Faced Lash Injection and Urban Decay Big Fatty Mascara (you can make the mascara, or any makeup, waterproof by using Benefit Cosmetics "She Laq")    anyways, i think you should try giving your eyelashes a rest for 2 weeks, and see what happens.    hope this helps !! :)|`|84bfe623838974188db70f3e01e4ea29aa	change mascaras..and make sure u use an eye makeup remover everyday before bed.|`|L5mmBuooaa	a substitute mascara can be clear mascara...easy to put on and there are no messy clumps...i use the KISS brand clear mascara    this can be found in any beauty supply/drug store store...|`|bYoGeKUUaa	just curl your eyelashes really good and put on eyeliner trust me it will look really good.    take a short break from maskara, umm al least a week|`|XUSETlMmaa	try buying MAC mascara. amd stop wearing mascara for a while so your eye lashes can grow back out =] .. if they can grow lol|`|UE2fFzq7aa	I use that stuff too.  I like it but yeah, it definitely makes your eyelashes fall out.  I think because it's super thick and I will pick at it.  Are you using the waterproof one?  It sounds like you must be if you need more than just water to get it off.  I love waterproof too, but it will totally make your eyelashes fall out.  I would just swith to the non-waterproof kind and you should be fine.  Your lashes should grow back pretty quickly if you stop using waterproof and are careful not to pick.  If you still want super thick lashes just try using 2 different kinds of mascara and doing multiple coats.       Another good one is the Loreal Voluminous.|`|4RpUP4teaa	You might want to put something light under your eyes--foundation but don't overdo it. Consider wearing a darker or metallic eyeshadow if you want to emphasize your eyes without using eyeliner or mascara. Gray/silver or a blue-green color might work, depending on your hair, skin, and eye color.    Wait a bit before using the mascara again. Buy a standard and simple mascara and use it from then on, even if the volume isn't as much as you had before. I find that many people look better when they wear less mascara actually, as too much is overpowering and it's almost as if the person has no eyes!

aLGV3eFdaa	Labret*  and what I did is get piercings that could be hidden.    I have a septum and I just got my industrial pierced.     My septum I can flip up; and my industrial barbell is black; the color of my hair.    You should respect her wishes; but if it really bothers you, tell her that once you get it, you can put a retainer in, so it's less noticeable.    Don't tell her that you'd have to wait, xD, tell her after it's pierced, and throw in something about it getting infected if you change it.      Ask her for one first, and gradually get more.  And if you have a C in a certain class, try to raise it up to a B or an A, and ask her then.|`|1681Iysiaa	You are pretty young. (i'm not much older, but still.) You should wait it out.

Wait a few years, and then try asking.|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	well ask it for you as a birthday , maybe she will let you get it .   it sucks when parents say no. but what can you do ?|`|CmZ2cLIqaa	My mom wouldn't let me do it when I was young.. So I got it done the day I turned 18, and it ended up getting infected and all sorts of drama.     You're a very pretty girl, and piercings are to bring the eye to your best features.. You don't need that now. If you still want them when they are out of style in 4 years, then get them.. :) But don't go behind your mom's back, it won't only hurt her feelings but it also will get who-ever pierces you in serious legal trouble.
LMuJMAqfaa	Oh, yellow probably wont work for your complexion, it would make you look very pale. Try subtle colors (light pink, sky blue, almost anything that has a pastel effect), they will go with your skin better; however, since it's an evening event, colors that stand out (red, true blue, etc) probably would work too but you have to be really careful with how you coordinate your clothes with your make up. Stay away from neon-looking color (neon yellow, neon green, orange ..)    Since you are very thin, get away from those dresses that tight fitted from top to bottom or mermaid styles, they just make you look way too skinny ... these are some of my suggestion, you dont have to get the exact ones, just have some idea about what works...    http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3005198/0~23...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3010969/0~23...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3001215/0~23...  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2992102/0~23...  These dresses gain attention to your height and it's flowy so they keep you from looking too skinny. they also have a goddess air which work well for your complexion and the chest will allow you to wear those pushup bras that makes you look over the top (maybe you dont need it but it's good to know that you can). Work well with smokey eye, light pink glossy lip, and wavy hair.    Also, on the very bright side, you know that you wont need to put on those killing high shoes that will hurt your feet => more dancing for the night.|`|SlkI4Umnaa	try to find cute prom dresses at amazon.....    http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...|`|AA10849165	http://www.gojane.com/shop-by-category-f...    look here for inexpensive dresses|`|lkkUh6eeaa	I personally think cache.

If your school's prom comes early, your best shot would be at a bridal store because they sell bridesmaid dresses too. Bridesmaid dresses easily pass as prom dresses. Windsor is also a great dress store, but its expensive. Also, being light complected, go for a cool color (blue, purple, green, etc.) Get one in a light shade though; it will help add curves and fill you out since you are so thin.|`|evT159Psaa	http://formalxchange.com/content/choosin...

Seems like hosiery makes shoes fit better too vs. going barefoot.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	any pantyhose|`|QrjjiOgTaa	i wear black trouser socks or very thin black ankle socks if i wear black pants|`|URLq6zIDaa	i go barefoot... pantyhose are for old ladies... i dont wear flats or heels when its freezing, i'm not an idiot, and my feet have never smelled, so maybe you have a unique issue...|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Lol. You have the right idea :)  I actually wear trouser socks, because i can not stand the pantyhose and how they bunch near the crutch area. LOL!!!|`|ge5m59rdaa	I prefer to just wear knee highs.  Mainly because I hate going through the hassle just go use the bathroom lol.  And with flats, I wear those kinds of socks that won't show with them.  They just go mainly on the bottom of your foot and around the top of your toes.  They help your feet not to stink instead of going bare foot.|`|56eAArieaa	trouser socks are better 4 feet don't make your toes mus together, don't make feet slide back and forth in shoes because of silkiness against the leather, feet hurt less and don't get deformed, also no panty line
TCpTlCTRaa	Essential oil scalp treatments are very effective at stimulating new hair growth and restoring hair to a healthy state. Excessive shedding is not normal. This type of hair loss is called telogen effluvium. There are many possible causes. You can find information on female hair loss including possible causes and solutions at http://vzbotanicals.com|`|KppM3VzAaa	I know how you feel.  This is a hard situation as it sounds as though you are concerned.  Stress leads to hair loss, so it's a bit of a vicious circle.      I too noticed some hair in the shower every time  I washed my hair.  It was a shock at first, I tried changing my shampoo and conditioner as I was using the supermarket's own brand (stupid I know).  Things got slightly better, but i was still losing.  I don't want to go bald.  I went to see the doctor and he prescribed a shampoo, which seemed to lessen the loss (not sure whether it was in my mind or not!) but I still lost.  I  now added a supplement every day, have been doing for the last 6 weeks or so and I have definately noticed a difference.  I did a lot of research and found out that by missing vital nutrients from my daily diet seemed to be having an impact on my hair growth.    Maybe you need some supplement like this? Have a look at the link, I hope this helps and good luck.|`|pOrwteQUaa	Yes i think you do. If you try using Better conditioners and shampoos that will help you some what.    Hope that helps you out.|`|te2aIm0Maa	Hmmm...how old are you? I'd wash less. My mom loses alot of hair..it could be because of stress. Go see a doctor if you get really concerned.|`|sm1uvFh9aa	Paranoia. Sounds like you are at the age that you could possibly be loosing hair, and you see a little bit of hair in the drain and equate it to loosing your hair. Average human looses between 80 and 100 hairs a DAY. If you see hair in the drain it doesnt mean hair loss. If anything, you stressing about hair loss could be causing some hair loss.|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier. You can find more cheap, effective and natural home remedies for hair loss as well as for healthy hair at http://www.wellnesstalk.org/hairfall.htm...

GoWPQvgHaa	4-5 days is NOT enough time, and it could close up in 6 hours. 7-8 weeks is how long you need to wait, but you still need to keep it in your ear at all times.  Even when mines out for a couple of hours, it starts to heal up and I've had mine for years..    So best option is to not get it, or go to a less prude school..|`|ZYJn4BH5aa	usually for an earing u have to keep an earing in your earlobe in for 6 weeks  i think cartalige is longer than that so i think if u take it out it may close up

3EnpyuS0aa	I suggest you get the Photofinish foundation primer from Smashbox.   It's a good primer for oily skin. I just haven't checked rustan's if they got it, but the last time that i went to ebay philippines, there are a couple of sellers who sell this amazing stuff.    I personally don't use any eye creams, but if you have very oily lids & you find that you're eyeshadow creases, you might wanna get Urban Decay primer potion, it's good for oily lids.     I saw it being sold in ebay philippines. If you can't find it, you can go for Mac paintpots. There is Mac in Glorietta.    As far as i know Lancome's eye creams are really good. check it out in Rustans or Marionaud in mall of asia. You might wanna drop by at Beauty Bar too.    ^_^|`|2b7NEgyMaa	Za dewy effect eye cream

OH if it's the pain ur worried about.. just get ur tongue split he had his done and it apparently hurts worse to pierce it :)|`|fI5j9cBlaa	it doesnt hurt to bad when you first get it done but once the swelling goes down after 3-4 days your gunna feel it :]|`|9e6d6cf539ae2a1beacc8bd0ad2e8fceaa	Mine didn't hurt at all, and I had really minimal swelling afterwards.  But I know other people who experienced alot of pain and swelling, so I think that everyones experience is different.  Just make sure you go to a piercer who is very experienced and get lots of ice pops to bring down the swelling.

Speaking as a guy, I do like long slim legs because I find it a very feminine quality. Yet I have to admit that I also wouldn't want to date a girl that is taller than me, just not my thing.

OuaUAAZlaa	majority of people who are allergic to earrings are actually just allergic to nickel.  i would suggest experimenting with different kinds of (100%, pure) metals- like gold, sterling silver, and titanium.    keeping that in mind, these places might help in your search:    piercing pagoda  http://www.pagoda.com/ (sells hypoallergenic earrings and other jewelry)    zulu moon  http://www.zulumoon.com/NickelFreeJewelr...

Hypoallergenic earring themselves are typically more expensive. (and sometimes a rip-off, too.)  Your best bet is to AVOID earrings that are cheaply priced or earrings that are made of nickel.  Nickel is what most people are allergic to in their earrings, belts, etc.  Get sterling silver earrings and look for earrings with higher karats.  Some ears are just sensitive, but your best bet is to avoid cheaper earrings.    Also, the sensitivity can be helped with a little hydrogen peroxide.  (Put it on a Q-Tip or a cotton ball and clean your ear lobes.)    Good luck!  -Violet

WdtJaNdEaa	You should be as distinctive as possible, so people can tell you're a celebrity.    One idea is to dress as Amy Winehouse, and do the beehive and the cat-eye. You could then wear a simple white tank and jeans.|`|mQ5v9KUWaa	Where a cute baby tee, with skinnys and flats. Then curl your hair and wear gold makeup. Top it off with a pair of oversized sunglasses and your good to go.|`|rB82Ujlgaa	you know a lot of celebs are doing the braids in the hair now. I think if it is like 60 degrees where you are at or warmer do boho style like Nicole Richie with a long maxi dress and the big sunglasses . if you have dirty blonde hair or blonde or Paris Hilton which would be absolutely funny prolly or Vanessa Hudgens  and is your a red head maybe Lindsey Lohan
KwNpyp3saa	I use Nair on my upper lips and above my eyebrows. I buy the one used for face only. The applicator is angled and easier to use.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Nair is nice, but for legs only. But, it smells a bit so you need to cover the smell with lotion/body spray.    Most hair removal creams can irritate sensitive skin, so keep it away from your face. For that, try little wax strips, those would most likely work.

In most states a full Cosmetologist license, includes the following separate licenses, that can also be obtained separately, if you only desire to specialize: Hairstylists/Barber, Manicurist & Esthetician.     Do not expect to much from a school, they are designed to teach you the basics of a specialized portion of a cosmetology degree on a broad level of study in order that you can pass the state test to be licensed and be employable at the entry level into a salon/spa.     Therefore, you WILL learn everything you need to know, but will not specialize at the beauty school level.  Once license you simply are now allowed by law to be paid to provide personal care services for a fee in your particular area of Cosmetology study. Once you graduate and are licensed, then you will be able to attend advanced education courses or seminars that either you pay a fee to attend or are offered for free by a skincare or makeup company that wants you to recommend and sell their product.    The good thing about Manicurist and Esthetician licensing is that the basic school hours are the least required by most states in the specialized fields of cosmetology and are also the least expensive. So you can get started on these advanced makeup courses quicker and move forward with your career faster.     - Maximilian|`|P9VvNKjlaa	LA definitely has courses in makeup artistry, usually 2 months to 3 months. Its mostly for high fashion, commercial and natural makeup. If you want to get an in depth course on everything from special fx makeup to airbrush makeup to natural makeup and all those in between taking course in other countries like london, parts of australia, france (if you speak french) and others. That is if you only want makeup artistry, If you want the whol enchilada going to any reputable beauty school is great too.

Wear some black flats to go with it and also some black tights would be nice.  Way cute!|`|NqMmvvgVaa	I like both of those separately, but I don't think they would go together. I think you need to keep it more simple. If you wear the skirt,t hen keep the top half more simple like a simple plain basic top and maybe with a jacket or bolero over the top. Or if you wear the top, then wear something more plain on the bottom half like some simple jeans or a black pant or plain aline skirt.|`|6JE0mcrLaa	Together...no. Separate... maybe. The skirt is blue and brown, and the top is gray. It doesn't match. Keep the top, and find a really cute, black pencil skirt, and tuck the shirt into it.

sDzbJvo3aa	Hey I am a natural blonde with blue eyes also.  I straighten my hair most days with a CHI flat iron, or curl it other days.  If your hair is naturally straight or curly, you are very lucky because my hair is sort of in between that, so I straighten it.    For makeup I always use the mascara Maybelline the Colossal Volume Express (it's yellow with purple writing) because it applies evenly with now clumps and really lengthens my lashes which looks really natural.  I also always use a gold M.A.C. eyeshadow and for eyeliner I use an angled brush with very dark brown eyeshadow to create a smoky eye look (not a harsh line). This looks very natural and really pretty (in my opinion)!!!     hope that helps!! :):) :]|`|YjkXyHBuaa	style your hair  & just wear lots of mascara. :]    that's what i do.

But i think that is just because she is smiling and smiling always makes people look good. They are all very pretty though.  (:|`|YZFk1Eu4aa	I think the girl in the middle.

Nj58Vi62aa	Try sunsilk :) ! it worked great for me, and they have it for like every hair type ! best of luuuck :)|`|AA10601381	My mom has veryyyy thin hair. Luckily I inherited my dads thick-hair gene. But, not so luckily, my sister didnt. They use "Eucalyptis Spearmint" shampoo and conditioner from bath and body works. it doesnt cost two much, both of them together being under 18$ I think. My sister sometimes switches between that and Tresseme 24 hour body.  Both of their hair stays nice and clean and very voluminous.  Good Luck.

4RpUP4teaa	I think this is possible, as I have had some of my own rings resized. Take it to a reputable jeweler, and they could do it. Otherwise, take a small piece of masking tape and wrap it around a section of the ring to make it thicker--just in one place. You don't see the tape really becaue it's on the underside of your hand! Works great and you can always take it off or add more!|`|jrB6z23Yaa	sorry not much idea, but as per my knowledge i think might break if tried to resize.    Dhruvika  http://www.myjewelersplace.com
FHi0v36eaa	I wear long tanks, black leggings, skinny jeans, bright colours, yoga pants, trousers, pretty skirts. I'm pretty girly. I like big accessories, big bag, bangles, earrings, all that stuff.<br>  <br>  For your makeover, I would just go to a store and try a bunch of stuff on, see what looks best on you and go with that. Accessories if you don't have many are great because they stretch out your pre-existing wardrobe.

L5161047aa	I hope this helps. these are steps that dont include surgery or makeup<br>  <br>  Step 1 Drink plenty of water. Water keeps your face hydrated... along with the rest of your body. If you can't go straight to 6 to 8 glasses a day, start small and work your way up to it. <br>  <br>  Step2 Use make-up remover to remove your eye make-up, not the harsh cleansers and scrubs. The eye area is delicate and you don't want to be too harsh. <br>  <br>  Step3 Try to eat some olive oil every day. It is full of antioxidants, including vitamin E and help skin, hair and nails. <br>  <br>  Step4 For those pesky crow's feet that you already have, try a little Preparation H. I know, I know... sounds strange, but this works. Just use a Q-tip to dab a little on the crow's feet, lightly rub in and let it dry for a minute. Then finish your skin care or make-up application. <br>  .........................................<br>  And this Reduces Crow's-Feet With Facial Exercises<br>  <br>  Step1 Open and close your eyes quickly while pressing on the temples of your head with two fingers. Repeat this exercise five times. \<br>  <br>  Step2 Relax. Keeping your eyes closed, look up and then down. Repeat this exercise 10 times. <br>  <br>  Step3 Keep eyes closed and lift your eyebrows up as far as possible while stretching your eyelids down as far as possible. Do this without assisting with your hands. Hold each stretch about 5 seconds and repeat 5 times. <br>  <br>  Step4 Open your eyes, lift your eyebrows and close your top eyelids only halfway. Then open your eyelids as wide as possible until the whites of the eyes show over the iris. <br>  <br>  Step5 Move your eyes up and down 10 times, and then look left to right 10 times|`|NAwzuLayaa	The best anti-again creams are sold in drug stores. <br>  <br>  ROC: These products are amazing and work exceptionally well, the only downside is the price. The thing that makes their products good is the retinol in them, this promotes anti-aging and healthy skin. ROC products are also enriched with vitamins that make them good for your skin.<br>  <br>  Olay: "Love the skin  you're in." These products are fabulous, but should be used at the first signs of again or in the early-mid state of fine lines and wrinkes. Assuming you have combination or normal skin, these products are my favorite and what I recommend: In the morning & at night, wash your face with Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Cleanser. In the morning, smooth a pump of Olay Regenerist  UV Defense Regenerating Lotion over your face.  At night, use Regenerist  Eye Lifting Serum around your eyes to brighten your eyes and reduce the appearance of crows feet and moisturize your face with Regenerist  Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment. If you want, you can also invest in Olay's Regenerist Daily Thermal Mini-peel. All of these products will cost you a good amount of money, but if you just buy each product one by one - they won't be as bad. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!
usxeet5vaa	Wear something cute and something that's your style. It totally depends on the weather, though. <br>  <br>  COLD WEATHER: Pale blue denim skinny jeans, black flats, white tight VNeck tshirt, black coat, hot pink beret (which is a french hat).<br>  <br>  HOT WEATHER: Short pale blue denim shorts, gray flowing tank that's kind of loose with buttons on the front, black belt on gray tank above belly botton- shirt loosened at the top of belt, leave hair loose, and ankle boots. <br>  <br>  If you think those outfits aren't good enough for the guy, then try something like a pink lacy tank with a long silver necklace, black short shorts, and leave your hair loose.

e7452607c6cd25e2dd95ccf033cdc6fcaa	You can modify this any way you want.    Last year I saw on the Martha Stewart show how they made a witches costume from black garbage bags and duct tape.  you need the drawstring bags. one they cut a slit in the area under the drawstrings so it was a bit longer and they cut ,in a zig zag, the bottom part of the bag off, that part is used for another part of the costume.  this one is for the top half of the costume. It is put on like a tube top with the drawstrings as the shoulder straps. pull and tie to fit.  don't worry about the strings coz they get covered later.  then another bag is cut to be the skirt, zig zag like the first and that is tied around the waist. Duct tape as much as needed to keep the top and bottom together.    they also cut a third bag in half to be the sleeves...they used duct tape to hold things in place. Just tape the sleves to the top.  the cut off parts are used to make the cape and they pulled on the zig zag points to stretch them.(also did on skirt)  It was pretty cool and waterproof but you may need scissors to cut the costume off when done.  I hope I explained enough for you to figure out how to do it.  a half dozen bags and tape are cheap especially if you already have them around     where you cut the zig zag depends on your size.  the sleeves bag is cut down the sides so one half the drawstring can be each sleve gather at the neck...  cut and fit the dress to size.  just add a hat and your good to go.|`|b27a06052c00c93a3cda7940a873f9d3aa	wal-mart i went there today!|`|4df414a63577a23799166ec86d152bd8aa	Walmart. or you could try a thrift store.|`|a81c426355a80d6ace72d456bf95d1aeaa	look in party city they have nice inexepensive costumes and TONS of kids costumes.

AA10405575	Bueno, deberias de usar una limpiadora y un humectante con filtro solar. Pero microdermabrasion con tu edad es demaciado temprano. Eso es una crema anti-arrugas y no creo que a tus 22 tengas. Es mas, se supone que a los 22 es cuando mejor esta tu piel. Debes de cuidarla y protegerla. De Mary kay vienen tambien unos productos para pieles como la tuya.  Pero no te recomiendo ni microdermabrasion, ni peelings caseros. No maltrates tu cara tan pronto porque despues cuando verdaderamente necesites esas cremas no te van a servir o hacer efecto. Como a los 30 se empiezan esa clase de cremas (anti-arrugas). Por ahora, como te dije...Limpiadora, tonificadora, y humectante con filtro solar...y si quieres una para la noche para que te ayude con lineas de expresion y lineas finas que puedas tener.   Bueno, chao! Cuidate y espero que te sirva de algo mi respuesta.|`|a7ad04c3fbb47c90efe1a985aa944009aa	se que los productos mary kay son de muy buena calidad, otra caracteristica que tiene la marca es que las revendedoras estan bien entenadas, te recomendaria que hables con la revendedora mary kay para que te asesore, a mi me parece que si tenes 22 a?os no necesitas microdermoabrasion, a menos q tengas ciatrices terribles o marcas producidas por el acne, si no te veo tampoco puedo opinar, pero me aprece que no es apropiado para una piel tal joven la microdermoabrasion

50010cef8906ea5dfdcb4b5d82be35b1aa	hot|`|cd3af0acc5f81dcaf30cd1c2a35402e8aa	First use a heat protector ( buy it at your hair salon) kinda dry it with the dryer and your hands to almost completly dry and the get your brush and style it as desire. If you try to style it all wet it may take you longer. Warm heat is enough.|`|52723b0120a9924f07b9276e179c0f3baa	umm definitely hot, just use a round brush and make sure its a somewhat decent one, and then blow it out, the hotter the better. you should probably ask someone at a hair salon what kind of brush they recommend.|`|a574a4cebdd2e203f8e0d83dfdc6abd1aa	Well, you could do both, depending on the look you are going for. If you want volume, blowdry your hair upside down, drying at the scalp first, then the ends slightly, let it cool before you flip back up. This will help set the volume you just created at the scalp.  Then dry the ends. A cool shot with the dryer helps set your style.  If you use a cool dryer to completely dry  your hair, it will take longer and won't damage your hair as much as heat drying. What ever  you do, I recommend using a product in your hair for protection, maybe gel or mousse. You could also try a blowdry lotion like Redken's Satinwear.  Good Luck

bcc595f419f79fe25b50c6d6d96b39d7aa	First, get a really good deep conditioner. When you get out of the shower, don't towel dry your hair - it causes flyaways. When you style your hair, try John Freida Dream Curls. It's a curl spray that leaves your hair smooth, without frizz ... and plus it's not "crunchy" when it dries - just soft. I use a shine serum, then spray that in my hair, hit it with the blow dryer for a couple seconds, then go. It's easy and it works for me, maybe it will for you. :)|`|kPerJYrVaa	use a little bit of mayo. like not even 1/4 cup  mix it with your shampoo.|`|a305947c9074890e9229dc91682f7634aa	just shower an add gel works 4 me|`|UE7Pp09gaa	Frizz-ease is an awesome product. You don't have a picture or more details but i also have crazy hair curly which sometimes goes all afro on me.

Ciara uses it.  Check it out at their website.|`|67282255f4bd1cc5f35e659a82b778baaa	I have a friend that has beautiful curly hair. Hair gel is her must have product. I suggest hair gel and maybe a hair serum. They also sell de-frizzing shampoo. Try the "Frizz-ease" line by John Frieda. And if you are worried about your hair being "crispy" from the hair gel, rub a leave in conditioner after to soften it up a bit.|`|9f3d9a080eb975061d06d69930b8126aaa	Leave in moisturiser, and frizz serum, Works a treat.    I recommend PPS Silk, Or PPS Menz The Enz.    As for the frizz serum, PPS Smootheez is great.|`|64bc91846c4e4beb2202ebd6459cd815aa	ok well you can get Garnier sleek and straight shampoo and conditioner and then put frizzing gel in your hair after you get out of the shower and then get a wet to dry hair straightner. I have the same exact problem but I do that and I have the best hair in all my classes.
7uwrw1BEaa	you can use Urban Decay Eye Primer Potion.  you can find it at Sephora or Ulta, around $15.    a little expensive but so worth it!!!!!!!!!!!    HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!  hope i helped!|`|70aad3602767fc27113c1208904fcaeeaa	Eyeshadow that disappears into creases, especially as we age, is not the result we hope for. Short of reapplying it every couple of hours, what can you do? Nothing works better than a primer, applied first to naked lids, to stop shadow from creasing. Try Origins' Underwear for Lids Smoothing Primer, $25.    You can also apply foundation across the eyelids to create a smooth canvas. Make-up artist Liz Jones recommends applying concealer all over the eyelid, then powdering down with a veil of loose powder. Jones suggests a dusting of a subtle shimmering powder such as Bloom's Aloha Loose Powder, $35. One caveat: shimmer can make crow's feet look deeper, so avoid covering any lines around the eyes.    Using an eyeshadow powder applied with a brush is another way to make sure colour stays put. To get more pigment onto the eyes press the powder onto lids instead of sweeping it back and forth.    Chantecaille's Lasting Eye Shade, $48, has one of the finest textures on the market and can be applied wet, or dry. Yves Saint Laurent's Long Lasting Eye Shadow Ombre Solo, $44, in matt, shiny or metallic formulas, contains microfibres that help it adhere to the skin surface and diffuse light. Your own shadow may last longer if you powder it lightly and apply another layer.|`|idGLlOuEaa	Eyeshadow bases are the way to go. My favorite is now from BABOR cosmetics called coverderm new name camoflage.  Mavala also makes a shadow base.  Scotty makeup artist extrodinaire
