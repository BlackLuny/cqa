np9CdiaNaa	ya as long as its not in career
lKdLsRPDaa	He's a good player, maybe a bit over hyped. I don't think he has really progressed much over the past few years, as everybody thought he would. Maybe a change of club, training, coaching etc, may move him to the next level.|`|S0LSmJ9haa	he is coming to be a bhoy in the summer, good player, still young and plentyof potential|`|bzwSCm6taa	tbh i have only watched him a couple of times..and yes he looked to be a good wee player..hope he lives up to his potential...see lazio are after him..if the papers are to be believed...|`|MPqO1Qayaa	no.    simple as. Fleck is a better player although he isnt the wonderkid the Gers are making out he is
U7BkuEU9aa	Is this really worth losing five points over?|`|N9pKl35Xaa	Depends how you're using the word. For example (just an example, i know its not real) say Federer and Safin have played 43 times against eachother in all their tennis life and out of those 43 times, Federer has one all of them. That would mean Federer is 'undefeated' against Safin, however Safin has always been defeated by Roger. Therefore Safin has 'never won' against Federer.   But in terms of say 'Serena William's defeated by Elena Dementieva for the 4th time in their 12 meetings' doesn't mean Serena has never won against her, just means that she was defeated on that particular day, therefore losing a match.  So, undefeated could be said as 'i have never been defeated by a certain player/ team, therefore i am undefeated'. and 'I have been defeated by that player/team on several occasions'. Meaning you have lost against them and also won.  'I've been defeated by that player/team every time' means that they've never won.   "I have always been defeated in a final" meaning never won a final  It takes NEVER winning something against someone or a team to be said as 'defeated/never won'  In all that confusing writing, i hope you understand it a little lol! But like i said, it all depends on the terms of which you are using it.|`|EwIR2Ivoaa	Overfeated|`|U5QOhYqvaa	a play on words? yeah, no.

69648225057d350e24deff5fc472380eaa	Learn the types of areas the fish in your area like (depth, bottom type, preferred temperature), and learn where such areas are. If the fish prefer rocky bottoms in 40-50 feet, go there. If they follow schools of bait over a sandy bottom, follow birds to locate baitfish schools. (If you mention where you are and the fish you're after, you can get more specific info.)    Marine charts are available which will give you the depths and general bottom type, but the specific spots which produce are seldom marked on the charts -- you have to either learn them from others or find them yourself. A good sonar for looking at the bottom and schools of fish will help a lot, as well as a GPS for specifically recording where reefs are when you find them.    Once you've located a good spot and conditions seem good (clean water, flowing current, etc.), fish there -- but don't sit there for eight hours if you're not catching. (You wouldn't do that on a lake.)|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	There should be hotspot charts for your area (I would think... and you shouldn't go out open water without some kind of chart) If not a hotspot chart, I believe most charts mark wrecks, reefs, etc, any of which should hold fish, as would major dropoffs (upwellings from steep dropoffs bring in food for various fish. Any floating debris you see (seaweed, flotsam, jetsam, that type of thing) is shelter of a sort for fish. Look for flocks of diving seabirds... if they're diving, they're after baitfish... where there's baitfish, there's bigger fish. Channel markers, bouys, bridge pilings, jetties, inlets.... Should I keep going?|`|AA11592349	its best to go on a charter then learn from them then take your own boat to open ocean.|`|N4t2t3dMaa	well you need to find a place to launch your boat and when your out there just watch where other people fish ive caught alot of fish along rock jetties but you can ask the people where you launch your boat where the best fishing is in that area

lrhOwySRaa	NO...    Why would anyone want to spend $40 Million to buy a MLS expansion team  and then get regulated to the USL and one of the USL teams (which cost 2-3 million) move up to MLS.  It would be a different story if the clubs have been around for 50-100 years but that is not the case.    MLS clubs have much higher salaries.  Some MLS teams have DP's (Beckham, Blanco, Angel, Lopez, Gallardo, Emillo, Ljungberg, etc.)  There is no way MLS would be allowed to spend that kind of money in the USL.  What would happen?  MLS clubs would have to release the DP's or even players making 150K and higher!      That would not be good for soccer in the United States.  Each of these leagues have strict rules.  It would be different if MLS and USL had the same governing body, but that is not the case.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	no. they have something better. it is called a salary cap and league wide parity. a relegation system is a trick to get fans to not notice that there are only a few teams financially capable of competing for the championship. it gives people who root for teams that don't have money something to root against since they have nothing to root for. the columbus crew might have been relegated after 2007. they won the championship in 2008. i think that speaks for itself.|`|33YAhRXFaa	no. because there isn't a high demand for soccer.     advantages: makes season more exciting (relegation battles make every game matter)    disadvantages: i wouldn't go watch a team that is in the 2nd division.|`|TxVAXBpTaa	It will happens if MLS merges with Mexico League... Top 20 teams will be allocated to Premier Division.. whereas the rest goes to Second Division.. but in reality It will not happens|`|S9ih5um6aa	unless americans really get into soocer i dont think so.  Americans arent really into soccer they like football,basketball,baseball  But i think it will be a while before we ever see more expansion teams and a relegation system.  An advantage to a system with no relegation is you can be the worst team and your still in the top next year|`|39cbcb3803017f914854d7e536ef56e5aa	no american sports fans dont really buy in to that concept if they did the detroit lions would be playing vs high school teams|`|195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	i doubt it.  if they want to have that any time soon, they basically have to have an agreement with the USL.  besides if u look at they way american leagues are fromed, it is not to be built under a regulation system.  honestly i know nothing about the possiblities if the MLS can have a relegation system and i dont want to fill u in with a bunch of bs.  but right now im sure it will hurt the mls if they do have that kind of system.|`|o7gV56ngaa	They really should. It's a much better and more exciting system when teams get into a league on merit and not just by buying a franchise. I find American sports very boring when the same teams are in the same league year after year, and yes maybe the Detroit Lions should be playing in a high school league. Maybe teams would have more motivation if they knew that the consequences of failure was relegation. The promotion and relegation system is much more democratic and fair.
r5AMG8g7aa	I concur with the other answers that the unbendable arm is body mechanics. I taught myself how to do it after seeing it many years ago. It more to do with relaxing than in strength.     *************  btw-  your Y/A    ID The Haad Martial Artist ?????   Did you mean Head instead of Haad?  I've been trying to figure it out for some time now.  *************|`|Jvsc2lQkaa	I train in aikikai, and while these things don't seem to be taught as a direct part of the cirriculum, the concepts form the foundation for a lot of the power that Aikido generates.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	Yeah, Shihan J is right.     Anyone can the the "immovable" "unbendable" stuff. It's simple body mechanics.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	more like body mechanics and focus. rather then ki|`|LnJjS8BRaa	more like easy to achieve party trick.    They could do it, but it will probably be left to the teacher and what he feels is more important to your training. These kinds of techniques are pretty common across the board with martial arts. It makes for a neat visual and gives people the illusion that taking this style will grant you superhuman abilities.    There is a show called Mind Body and Kick *** Moves; the host goes around various markets between segments and brings this sort of trick to the street.
w02Z4Mnhaa	Huh?  Ask a doctor.
706be87ba15de1949576cc5eb6adbe06aa	Once this world cup is over then the hosts have to qualify. Trust me, if people had to come here and SA wasn't playing. Lets just say it would be a bad thing.
x7NtYD8Aaa	Lidstrom, one of the best defense in the NHL was not voted into the starting lineup, only as a reserve. Pavel Datsyuk one of the most best stick handlers of all-time, also not chosen in the starting lineup. Zetterberg, Hossa, Rafalski all not chosen as even reserves. How does this happen. How do 4 Canadians attend the all-star game. How can you have an all-star game without all the all-stars. And they must not of let down their fans because nobody likes Detroit besides us...people that live in Detroit. So i'm glad they didn't go because they need rest to help the team and not help the ruthless fans elsewhere who hate them. And the suspension was bull.|`|d9329ea0bdca3de02039a3f70fc57a5faa	I find it annoying how bettman is forcing people to go to the all star game. Unless there is an "all star game clause" in the player's contracts, Bettman has no right to force people to attend a game. Also the all star game can lead to injury (not checking related but muscle related) and its not right forcing people to do something that they shouldn't do. Let the managers make punishments since they play for the team, not Bettman.|`|HJuOSvmdaa	Well I think it is a bad rule, and Datsyuk was actually hurt...not sure about the Lidstrom injury though.  But they DID know the consequences.  Besides, they got a break in the middle of the season anyways, that's not a bad thing.  And we locked up Zetterberg.  I see no reason to ***** about losing to Columbus once.  We still got a point too.  LOL.  And S Mason is on my fantasy team anyways...    Oh, and I'm not a bandwagon Detroit fan, and there's really not that many of them anyways.  Most people that are Red Wings fans have been for years...Detroit hockey has a great tradition and a great following.  My grandpa's grandpa watched Detroit LOL.    **edit: Datsyuk and Lidstrom weren't voted into the All-Star game either, like Mason.|`|1ApbWVhsaa	Take a deep breath..You sware?What the hell does that mean?Whatever it means it's got to be bad...If they lose the number one seed by one point there will be no controversy.Just getting ready to play the number 7 seed instead of the number 8.Which could be Columbus..No offense.    *It wasn't a surprise to your Red Wings.They knew the consequences.|`|1cde960f92f3cf52ea9b7b2bff72b659aa	I agree with the suspensions.    I guess that makes me an idiot who knows nothing about hockey too. c'est la vie.|`|2iuZdBXraa	Rules are rules and they knew the consequences.  No exceptions.  It's not just about playing, it's for the fans too.  Crosby didn't play, he showed.  The players owe the fans, they pay their outrageous salaries.  And too bad they lost against Columbus, karmas a b*tch.  Maybe if you knew more about hockey you wouldn't automatically see it from a biased Redwings point of view.|`|DvBPLP4saa	No, actually (I'll be like the only one here in this section that feels this way, but whatever) I don't think they should've gotten a suspension.     So what.....they were hurt. I'm not a Red Wing fan, but I'm glad Datsyuk and Lidstrom are putting their TEAM in front of the All Star Game. And so what...they didn't go to Montreal for the dumb publicity. Woop dee doo. Anyone ever think Datsyuk and Lidstrom wanted to spend some quality time with their wives and kids for a change instead of focusing on hockey?     I mean....why force the ASG down players throats? I watch the game every single year, but it's nothing. It's always been just a joke and a time for players to have get-togethers.     As you may have known, Sidney Crosby was hurt and didn't play, but he went but didn't skate/play. But he's allowed to play tonight. No suspension for him. The reason being because he showed up........what's the big deal about showing up? The media only showed Sidney like once and didn't talk about him. So he sat up there doing nothing. Fun.     I have to shake my head right now. Suspending a guy because he didn't show up for the ASG due to injuries is almost as dumb as suspending a guy for calling a girl his "slopp seconds".....tisk tisk.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	Yes|`|0Umym3h9aa	Yes I do. They get paid millions of dollars to play on a regular basis but they can't do one game for free? And if they are really injured then skipping the all star game PLUS another regular season game will only benefit them and allow them to heal 100% before coming back.    You also asked "why would you want a sick person to show up in an ice arena?" Well, because this sick person shows up to play before the all star game so I guess he must not be that sick, right?     You guys could have easily won without Lidstrom and Datsyuk so quit complaining.     The Columbus goalie also missed a game BEFORE the all star break, therefore he did not have to sit out AFTER because he already served his time away from the team.|`|EJOZ1pdLaa	Yes I agree. They deserved it. Maybe you shouldn't jump on the hockey bandwagon so much and cheer for the wings. For those of you hardcore yahoo hockey answers guys, much like myself, you may have noticed that I totally called it that this was going to happen a few days ago. Nash is a beast! I swear if the rest of the team didn't suck so bad, i might actually cheer for them. Too bad i'm a hardcore Dallas fan.    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	I agree they should be suspended, this is a Job. If you had a big event to go to for work and called out at the last moment there would be consequences.Your players chose not to go to the game to rest, that being said they got a few extra days of it. They let down there fans, the kids, the people who voted for them. I would imagine Columbus's goalie was invited to the young stars game, not voted by the fans.|`|WXdMHMfwaa	Yes i agree with the suspension.    Its an honour to be named to the allstar game...and to not show up is like spitting in the face of the fans...not cool...even if u are a superstar     oh and steve mason was on IR wasnt he?    Hell even luongo went, if he got injured hed screw the canucks...but he still went....|`|IKpK0Z62aa	its unfortunate if your a wings fan but i think it is good because it keeps the players from thinin they are better than the game. Also if there was no rule there would be a bunch of half *** players out there and the game would suck. its all a plablicty stunt by the nhl.|`|9vNeOUBUaa	I dont agree with suspending players b/c the AllStar game is just that, an All Star Game...... if anything, they could fine them I guess.... but suspending them for regular season games doesn't make sense     also, maybe if a player doesn't show up to the all-star game.. it would make more sense to suspend them from participating in the next two all star games ( if they so happen to be chosen again)

bkhvdfJxaa	to prevent it...you put the spool of line into a screw driver and let some one hold it with a little bit of tention...and then you spool it into the reel while holding a towel to put more tention onto the line....doing this will striaghten out the line and keep it tight so that when you cast out, it wont tangle up and create alot of birds nest in the line....most people like to take it to a lake or a big field and tie a sinker to it and cast it out as far as they could and reel it back in to tighten up the line....|`|nfCH7nkTaa	just make sure that when you spool it the line is tight so it doesn't spin and is on the reel nice and snug and not loose|`|d9L9C4dHaa	Here is how I used to do mine if I had problems I would pull the line almost all out tie it onto something and reel it in or when you put it on spool by hand winding try and pull the line as tight as you can.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	you will probably think l'm crazy but you spooled it on backwards. when you fill a spinning reel, make sure it is coming off the spool the same way it is going on your reel. you can check this by reeling on a few yards then let the line hang in a loop and see if it twists . if it hangs free and does nothing, you're fine. if the loop twists a bit simply turn your filler spool around. the problem is if it comes off the spool backwards, it puts one twist for each wrap off of the spool. then your line is full of twists on your reel and flies uncontrollably off the reel when you prepare to cast. you may possibly have overfilled your reel also. only fill it to within an 1/8 or 1/16th of an inch of the spool lip. when filling ANY reel, make sure you have some tension on the line.

xOReEw6Waa	I have a NEF Handi-rifle single shot in .243 Win for my 11 year old and the ergonomics and recoil are just right for him. He got started with a .223 T/C Encore, but the bull barrel and ergonomics weren't as good. The NEF should be right around $200 for the rifle, no scope.     Going up a bit in price, you can find Weatherby Vangard/Howa 1500s and the Stevens/Savage rifles usually at Wal Mart and major Sports dealers for $300-$400, and both are wonderful weapons that he can keep a lifetime. IN my opinion stay away from the Remington 710/770, I know the price is cheap but it is a throw away gun with no resale value and the fit and finish is appalling. Look for closeout rifle buys right now at local shops too, this is the slow season and sometimes you can get a bargain--even at Bass Pro, Wal-Mart, Joe's.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	do yourself a favor and look at savage. for the money, they have the best bolt action rifle out there.|`|TBAfpnmgaa	I've seen Rossi single shot .223's for around $200.

fLpnC8qtaa	Then don't defend them Dan, just support your players. When United started off badly again this season, I was defensive of them. Lets face it, they started last season that way too, was my common excuse. But as things wore on and they played flat, frustrating football, I didn't defend it, because you can't. I just kept the faith and accepted they had to improve, believing they could. And they have because they are a great team. The league is far from over yet. Sir Alex makes me scratch my head sometimes believe me, but I have faith in him too.

I tried to agree with him as much as possible BUT HE IS A TOTAL AND UTTER IDIOT!    CYA LEAGUE TITLE.|`|mK06dus9aa	I'm fed up with it and I support Chelsea - God only knows what you guys are going through|`|IlDD3qumaa	Hey wasn't you bragging how you were going to win the title earlier in the season?    Pathetic this could turn out into a 1horse race.|`|uXXbegw5aa	Rafa seriously needs to go    IDIOT|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	Oooo i love seeing the same scousers who were so smug at the season's start getting angry> It's so fun.  Im pissed at u guys cuz i really thought u would have saved us from another Man U title win, but it's gone. I doubt u all have the mental strength to get back on top. Sorry.|`|JCRdicqXaa	I told you that 18 months ago, Dan.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	He's had a lot of opportunities to win the league and has had some success in winning cups.  I don't know if a change will do much good but its getting to that point,|`|uUitKmJMaa	Yes..    Man u are gonna win the league.    RAFA OUT. Prick!|`|NmSSKnnWaa	rafa lost the plot ages ago.lfc need a change|`|u9k4Orvpaa	i feel for ya bud ... honest...  you cant let rafa go yet cos you do still have a good chance of the league ... he's just gotta stop faffin around ...|`|kxMQXhuAaa	I give up!.I've always thought Lucas was pretty useless,tonight's just confirmed it.How Benitez picks him ahead of Alonso,Riera or even Keane is beyond me.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	i just refer to what ranting Rafa said about my team playing negative at least we had a good reason for it with no strikers , i think you need to keep Rafa as i am now lmfao|`|Pfq2zRejaa	since rafas rant we havent won a game an wer now 3rd !! rafa out|`|CryNyW0Faa	im a bit fed up with it now. Yes hes given the title to Man U now but i dont think he should go, hes a brilliant manger, does some wierd stuff, but hes been the best manager we've had in a long time|`|9wSayIDwaa	Think yourself lucky...how do you think I feel...I'm a Gooner !!|`|AA11076076	He has gone mad, what was he thinking?  To be honest I do not rate Lucas at all, every time he plays he fouls someone and gives away free kicks this time even worse.  I would not put him on at all.  I certainly wouldn't take Gerrard off unless his head had fallen off or he couldn't walk. Just bizarre ridiculous decisions one after the other, I wanted "the Special One"  Jose would have been great for us.  By the time Rafas contract is up I think Jamie Carragher will have finished his managers exams so maybe he could take over!  At least has a fair idea what we all think, plus I think he would make a great manager
LIKkt8djaa	You could hand flex the high back and straps or just do what your friend said and just strap into the board and practice presses.|`|UpPWXRK4aa	I mean to break in things you have to literally use them first for them to properly break in, but maybe you can strap in at your house with the boots and jump around, do some 180s on your rug. If you can't even get your boot in the binding to start with then it is the wrong size and you should get the right size.

LIKkt8djaa	They don't even look deep enough to hold the p-tex in, shallow gashes like that the p-tex will just get pulled out, The only thing I would do is smooth it out, shave off the parts of the base that are sticking out.|`|MxhZgjXWaa	Burn it or throw it out.|`|NzEKpeIjaa	fix it yourself because itdoesnt look that bad|`|XLGnAkIqaa	Bring it to a local shop and ask them to do a full tune. (avg cost 30-60 bux) depending on how the shop does business.  You'll spend more time and grief trying to do it all yourself. Your board is not that bad.   You should see the boards that I ride.     Either that or just ride it, beat it and buy a new one next season.|`|q2TOb6unaa	Looks like ptex should do the job. I don't see any core showing so you shouldn't have to get it fix at a shop. You may want to put a few layers of p-tex on just to make sure it doesn't break open again.    EDIT: Assuming you are talking about that gash on the right side. If you are talking about all the scratches just get a base grind from the local shop at the end of the season.    Good luck.
q2TOb6unaa	There isn't an official guide that you can buy. Only websites that give some tips and how to get achievements.

Good luck.|`|5V6jEg9saa	NOT HERE this section is for SNOWBOARDING not SNOWBOARDING GAMES.|`|DV61eR5iaa	Well i know for sure beause i own that game on Playstation3. It is a really good game, you get to pick your guy, track, do lots of tricks and races plus sign up for ps3 online and you can play multiplaayer mode. NOTE: Shaun White snowboarding is NOT on PS2 but its ONLY ON PS3. The best place to buy it is at Best Buy or Future Shop, Walmart also. THe price is around $50 to $70 dollars depending on where you get it. Hope that helps.

4kdlE54Paa	Barry Sanders    There are many successful QBs I could get, but Barry Sanders was one of a kind.  He is the only RB that comes to mind that can be successful without a good team.  Players such as Emmitt Smith were helped significantly with an Oline that opened up cave size holes.  Sanders did it with hair line crack holes.  He was very elussive and made plays almost literally by himself.  Had he not retired early, he would have been the all time rushing leader without a doubt and do it with a bad Lions team.  Had he been on a better team, he would be considered similar to the comparison of Jerry Rice to other WRs.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Ill take Sanders.  If you have a good running game and a good defense, those are the ingredients to winning.  QB obviuosly helps but you dont NEED a great QB to win.|`|cGeKaHd9aa	Barry Sanders. He put up big numbers in detroit with a poor offensive line. my favorite team is the philadelphia eagles. they have a great O line. barry sanders with a great O line= Magic.|`|nltFZcuGaa	i would rather had sanders. we already have peyton mannig so they would MURDER and go 16-0|`|2CuuIT70aa	I would rather have Barry Sanders just because my team is the Eagles and I like McNabb a lot.    And even factoring out the Eagles and thinking about any other team, I think I would rather have Barry anyway because he seems like a better person than Marino, what with his 'roid rage and all.  He'd be a better team leader.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	As a Dolphin fan approaching an 11 year hangover, we'd take Dan back in a minute. We have Ricky and Ronnie already and Dan's ability to throw long and fast would open up lanes for them like nobody's business.    Barry was great, but Dan was better for the profile of the team, mostly because Barry was so quiet. Dan didn't quit as early too and could have had another season behind a decent o-line if Jimmy Johnson hadn't been intent on starting the rot within the Dolphins offense.|`|90ZaNZE4aa	i guess Marino if i needed a Qb    running game for the Giants is fine    Edit  real guitar hero- marino never won a SB|`|RxVvNvX8aa	Dan Marino.

Also when they start the game 5 minutes after it starts and sometimes they have already scored. Another thing would be the commentary depending on the commentators, it annoys me when they are very boring and start talking about random things.

kgczgM3Raa	Like some of the other posters, I really like Tom Durkin.  When the race is exciting or especially important, you can hear it in his voice.  I'm always impressed with his ability to come up with great comments, and I generally like how the energy and tone of his call mimics that of the race.  Some of my favorite of his calls are the 1998, 2004 and 2007 Belmont Stakes, and the races he has called with the horses Arrrrr and Doremifasollatido (all on youtube if you care to watch).|`|D1beU6MPaa	Tom Durkin by far. Mike Bataglia is pretty good. In 2006 I attended the Breeders Cup and Trevor Denman called it. Since you can't see the backstretch at Churchill Downs, he never said a word about Pine Island when she broke down.   Years ago Chic Anderson was very good. He called the Belmont that Secretariat won by 31 lengths. He died shortly after the race, but he was exciting, and very correct when he called a race.  Tom calls races at both Belmont and Aqueduct on a regular basis.|`|8bTder08aa	In the US?  Trevor Denman.  I've followed his career since he came to the US and started calling races in Southern California, and IMO there is nobody who can touch him for insightful, accurate and exciting race calls.      The late Joe Hernandez, who for many years called the races at Santa Anita, was also superb.|`|aeODdMATaa	I like Tom Durkin.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	Trevor Denman is awesome..|`|RyZHhI6aaa	My favorite is Tom Durkin.  Trevor Denman's voice is great, but Tom Durkin is so entertaining.    This is a great race call by Tom Durkin: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eI2ZZXv_5...    This one is very funny too:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwhcS1VPc...    And this is great:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p1QQfpbCi...    And this one:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a3sdADaf...    There's so many more, but I'm out of time ;o)|`|a16c444aed9b9c4a29dfaa63a130cd3caa	easily tom durkin , in the USA .  has a great sense of humor and does a awesome job of calling the races. He is accurate and insightful and knows how to use a colorful phrase.  plus he has an american accent :-)|`|4lWd4vFNaa	Fred Capposella    "As many in the crowd of 25,632 move nearer the rail that can mean only thing-ITS NOW POOOOST TIME"|`|RFPUcsptaa	yeeeerrrrr mom.
xaSEuGBGaa	The only person ive ever met was Tommy Dreamer at WWE New York. He is cool as hell, super nice guy.    I know people who have seen Taker and Mark Henry here in Austin TX but ive never met em personally. I hear they are both cool, though Mark Henry seems to always have bodygaurds so hes kinda imposing. My buddy said he saw Taker at a BBQ restaurant, but its funny cuz my friend who is all of maybe 5 foot could only think to say, Damn, your tall!|`|Y93pUmAGaa	i live in niagara falls so we have the wwe store (only one in the world)   i have met:     Trish Stratus- so nice she gave me a hug !!

John Cena- he was really funny and down to earth     Mr.Kennedy- he was using his old gimmick so he was acting rude but he posed for pictures.     and Rob Van Dam- best dude ever man.     hoped that helped|`|tCWwQfYNaa	I saw Carlito,Primo,Jeff Hardy,Edge,Big Z,Brian Kendrick,Big Show,Undertaker,HHH,Cozlov.

I don't really *want* Serena to lose though, I just don't have a favorite between her and Dementieva...BUT I think the winner here will be the younger Williams sister. As for the other semifinal, Dinara all the way! I do think she'll win, but if she could just stop double-faulting so goddamn much the match would be much easier!    Now the boys...I love Andy and he's been playing really well, but when the FedEx decides that he wants to start competing *seriously*, there's no one who can stop him...except for Rafa, that is! ;-)|`|gCGbbIMcaa	In a nutshell    Serena  Safina   Roddick|`|9AR6B4ELaa	serena, vera and fed|`|zN0orpp3aa	You got 1 right.

Let me just say though that I think it is really unfair for Serena and Elena to have to play today.

EGe0k8P6aa	OK... We've got three different types of guns being bandied about here. First there are the pure BB guns. Then there are the dual ammunition guns. Finally there are the pellet guns. All three have a different answer concerning what's the most powerful. I'm also going to point out right now that the price for the most powerful guns will suprise you.<br>  <br>  Pure BB guns only shoot BBs.The most powerful pure BB gun I know of is the IZH-Baikal MP-514K co2 BB rifle. It claims to shoot a 5 grain (or maybe 5.1 grain) BB at 558 fps for a muzzle energy of 3.5 ft-lbs and costs around $125-$130.<br>  <br>  Dual ammunition guns shoot both BBs and pellets. The most powerful dual-ammunition gun I know of is the Crosman 2100. It claims a muzzle velocity of 755 fps with 5 grain BBs for 6.3 ft-lbs of muzzle energy and a muzzle velocity of 725 fps with 8 grain pellets for 9.3 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. Its a repeater only with BBs. Pellets must be single loaded. This gun will cost between $60 and $75 depending on which version you get.<br>  <br>  Pellet guns range from the sublime to the ridiculous. Most of them will deliver in the 15-25 ft-lb range. However there are powerhouses out there that exceed that by a substantial margin. Those powerhouses start at about $500 and work their way up to $2000+ for the most expensive guns. The most powerful production pellet gun is probably either the Sam Yang 909 or the Shinsung Dragon Slayer. Both will deliver between 150 and 200 ft-lbs of muzzle energy. (Custom guns like the Barnes Justice (600+ ft-lbs of muzzle energy) and DAQ .457 Outlaw (500+ ft-lbs of energy) will substantially improve on factory production guns. They'll also cost more.) Stepping down to 9mm you're looking at the Shinsung Career 707 9mm Ultra (a repeating rifle which gives around 100-140 ft-lbs of muzzle energy). In .25 caliber the Shinsung Career III 707 seems to be the top performer With 20 grain pellets that works out to around 67-72ft-lbs of energy (a figure that will go up with heavier pellets to 75-80 ft-lbs of energy). In .22 caliber, there are a bunch of contenders for the title of most powerful depending on how you want measure it (single shot power, over a string...). They include the Airforce Condor, Shinsung Career III 707, the Evanix Hunting Master AR6 / AR4, and the Daystate Air Ranger. All of these guns will deliver over 40 ft-lbs. Heck all of them should deliver 50-60 ft-lbs, with the AR6 claiming into the 70s (for one or two shots) and the Air Ranger claiming 80 ft-lbs (I'm tossing the most powerful .22 caliber title to the Air Ranger). In .177 caliber, there are a lot of familiar faces and a couple new ones the Airforce Condor, Sumatra 2500, the Evanix Hunting Master AR6, the Gamo Hunter Extreme (if its numbers are accurate, though I have my doubts about that). These guns should generate in excess of 25 ft-lbs, with the most powerful of them delivering in the vicinity of 35 ft-lbs. The rub is that most of these powerhouses are single shots (with a couple exceptions like the Shinsung Career III 707 and the Daystate Air Ranger). Then again at those power levels you probably aren't going to need to worry too much about a quick second shot to finish off a game animal...|`|jI85GYGoaa	If you are American - the world is your oyster depending on your budget.<br>  <br>  If you are a Brit power levels dont really enter into it as you will be limited by Law to 12FT/Pounds in a rifle and I think 5ft/pds in a pistol (though dont quote me on the last figure)<br>  <br>  Should you desire anything more you will probably have to go through the rigmarole of obtaining a Section 1 FAC.<br>  <br>  Generally you will find that in the U.K. you will pay extortionate amounts for what is very mediocre engineering / quality when buying new.<br>  If you are genuinely looking to get into the hobby have a look at the secondhand market - good quality air weapons from the 70s 80s are still available at a fraction of new - collecting is a whole new hobby in itself.<br>  <br>  Have Fun Best Wishes .|`|Z8UV6S3baa	So, there is a big difference between "BB guns" and "Pellet guns". Most "BB guns" will also shoot pellets, but "Pellet guns" will not shoot BB's.<br>  <br>  If you look across the top of the line of the multipump pneumatic Daisy and Crossman line, such as the Daisy Powermasters you can generally find BB guns with reservoir which can get you into the 700 fps range or a bit more. Generally that is about the limit in a BB gun because of the physics of shooting a BB. Generally any of these are available through your typical box store and for less than $100, in some cases much less.<br>  <br>  If we get into the world of pellet guns, repeaters or clip feds fall into a couple of groups. CO2, Spring Piston, and Pre Compressed Pneumatic. Again, with CO2, there ends up being some practical limits that top these out between 500 - 600 FPS for a number of reasons. Several companies make these of varying quality and can be had - depending on what exactly you look for between about $40 - $150. The difference in cost is generally not because of power, but because of how the close the air gun simulates a firearm.<br>  <br>  For Spring Piston, this is a pretty select group. I really only know of a couple, the primary being the Theoben SLR98 which is a $1200+ air rifle which gives you about 800 FPS in a .22 caliber pellet.<br>  <br>  Last is PCP, and here you are looking at dollars vs. power being a direct relationship. Running all the way up to several thousand dollar Quakenbush custom rifles which will put down Buffalo.<br>  <br>  I've added a few websites at the bottom which sell a range of air guns for you to browse.<br>  <br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|fUDlbOP0aa	Piper Precision Products (P3) Venom BB gun. <br>  real pricey, for .177 caliber I believe that is probably the most powerful BB gun ever made. a multi barrel CO2 powered fully automatic portable mini gun-rifle. It had a limited production run and it has ended. I do not know if they're making more. if they do, it would be around $3500.<br>  <br>  the other powerful BB gun is in 6mm airsoft caliber, a P3 M134 Vulcan Mini gun BB gun. multibarrel like the real mini gun, fires around 3000 rpm, there are promotional videos of it being used to destroy TVs and home furnishings. BB after BB, the ROF is so fast it looks like the gun is chewing always the target rather than shooting holes in it. I first saw them on eBay for around $1875 each, the price has then risen to $2500, $3100 before the production of those ended too. Currently models are being handled by another company, starting at 5000$ each. <br>  <br>  There's others, like the Strafer smg, shooting either 6mm or .177 bbs at 9,000 to 10,500 rounds per minute. more compact and cheaper than the M134, but also reduced range and firepower. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pipersprecisionproducts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pipersprecisionproducts.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.xcalibertactical.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xcalibertactical.com</a>|`|39d77d396b6018aac260eb632b7665f9aa	>>What is the most powerful multi shot BB gun?<<<br>  <br>  The M134-A2 Vulcan MiniGun<br>  <a href="http://www.pipersprecisionproducts.com/m134_6mm.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.pipersprecisionproducts.com/m...</a><br>  World's most powerful multi shot BB gun<br>  <br>  That was what you had in mind right :))<br>  <br>  Later: "ishootbirds2" >>"The other powerful BB gun is in 6mm airsoft caliber a P3 M134 Vulcan Mini Gun"<<<br>  <br>  If you're going to read my answer then use it as your own, at least get it right...The M134-A2 Vulcan Minigun is NOT, I repeat, NOT an airsoft gun in any way, shape, manner or form.

Got shot once, never again!|`|URZeQfQCaa	The Jackal air rifle is probably the most powerful, if you can find one for sale.<br>  <br>  Co2 are powerful enough for good target practice.

aIhVHfMUaa	Frankly, i think there is a mistake in the side, i would have made 2 changes from the last test team, the way i see it you dont want to mess to much with a team that has won. firstly, Hughes for Hayden, kinda obvious that one<br>  <br>  Secondly, McGain for Hauritz with McDonald providing another pace option, i ALWAYS want a spinner in my team, no matter what form of the game or where its played, i always like to have that variation<br>  <br>  but i think they will have North at 6, have Hilfenhaus debut and McDonald carry the drinks. it will be interesting to see how Hilfy goes, his ODI form of late hasnt appeared to be to good, but people tell me he is a better 4-day (5-Day in this case) bowler than One Day Bowler, good luck to him! Bollinger still deserves to be there, he may be a lefty but he is a different style to Johnson, Johnson mainly slants the ball accross the right hander, where as Bollinger tries to swing the ball both ways<br>  <br>  well no matter who they pick, i think it will be another great series and best of luck to all involved in it, particularly the new boys|`|IDBasYahaa	That's a better balanced team than the one that played them earyler this year.<br>  <br>  I hope Hilfenhaus get's a bowl ahead of Bollinger. If Bollinger bowls, the attack will be too similar, 2 left arm bowlers, angeling accross bowling on a good or short of a length. Hilfenhaus is the best swing bowler in Australia, & batsmen such as Prince & Kallis have shown in the past they have problems facing quality swing bowling early in their innings.|`|AA11088802	they should give chance to north|`|yeb7fyHsaa	I don't think this all-pace attack is going to work in favor of Australia. Obviously McDonald is going to be 12th man. I would rather if they bench Hilfenhaus and put in Bryce McGain.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Let's just hope it is McDonald. Don't forget he comes from one of the two favoured states. I wouldn't be surprised to see North 12 th man.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	Good team.|`|OJtFNjfvaa	They have a good side.

When you check the schedule there should be a link on the left side of the screen to check their radio and TV schedule.|`|3pLv7KBvaa	go to your team webiste and it will explain it. <br>  <br>  ex red sox have two games today  this afternoon and the 7pm will be on nes. yes i know your from ny but tis only example.|`|4cJuKxJbaa	Yea, some are...it depends on your team...go to your teams website to find out! YES Network is putting tommorows game on tv! :)
na8V4nm4aa	Ok...for a start look at the blocking scheme of the offense. If it's a play action, the O-line will pass-protect and form the pocket. It's it a draw, the O-Line will not pass-protect. The O-line will do different things depending on where the runner is headed(eg. on an inside draw, the tackles might leave the DE's unblocked(especially if the DE's are lined wider than 5 technique) and move up to the second level to block the LB's).<br>  <br>  Now, as for what you should do, the best person to ask is your coach. It depends on the coverage you're playing. Are you playing two-deep? 4-deep? It depends on the safety support you have. If you have safety support, then you can attack the runner. If you don't have safety support you should stay with the WR.|`|fKco44yxaa	Your a fool.<br>  <br>  Your reads are all wrong.<br>  <br>  Number 1 - why are you looking at the QB? unless your in zone...but then you would be watching your zone and the QB...the Receiver wouldn't be able to block you...and you would have ages to decide what is going on<br>  <br>  Number 2 - Your a corner...play your bloody Receiver....no one else...not the QB or HB, you just play your guy until it is clear what is going on...if he starts running you run with him...if he blocks you, you break the block and own the QB or HB...<br>  <br>  When would a WR ever block on a play action.....seems pointless, i've never had that happen.|`|pMr6Cdl3aa	Keep your shoulder's square to the line of scrimmage and know the down and distance. If its 2nd and 15, and you guys are in dime package, chances are that a draw is coming. Play your man with your shoulders square to the line of scrimmage until you read run then pursuit outside angle. Nobody can be let outside of you or else its 6..... aka touchdown|`|cWsBSpQNaa	you drop back then when the hand off happens charge the ball|`|PMluTf72aa	Man to Man Defense:<br>  focus on the WR.  when you see his head turn towards the QB or in the air, quick turn your head in that direction.  odds are if he's looking in the air, the ball is being passed in your direction.  your focus is to defend the pass, not the run, unless you are 100% sure it's a run.<br>  <br>  Zone Defense:<br>  Your eyes should be mostly focused on the QB.  where is the ball?  that is what you need to know.  as far as your position on the field, you need to have a good idea where you are at and where the WR is. it's like multi-tasking.|`|goe3y4FPaa	I WOULD DUNK IN UR FACE.. AND FLEX MY MUSCLES KOBE BRYANT STYLE
GJRxBqknaa	madden|`|dcNT65mTaa	Mike Adamle was horrific!|`|Caf5W9nraa	Oh you mean commentators.<br>  Has to be Mike Adamle.<br>  He has no knowledge of the wrestling business and can't draw any emotions in matches and can't be taken seriously.|`|xUsUNGYyaa	Tony Sciavonie wasn't too bad but just look at the jokers he had beside him that didn't help except for the brain.<br>  I think the worse was Dusty Rhodes and Mongo the stupid peppi dog thing lol|`|v7WLVxR5aa	Funki|`|NcPuEOJxaa	Mike Adamle|`|eZdstLHWaa	Howard Finkel
A4OWCZ3Laa	u think that's surprising! look at marco jaric and his victoria secret girlfriend. he's so ugly and has abnormally close eyes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0807/espy.red.carpet/content.1.html" rel="nofollow">http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multime...</a>|`|BzOcQIcoaa	Dunno he must have a huge schlong!|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I agree how did he did that,he's very luck man as Marko Jaric to get Andriana Lima
8ivnzNi5aa	Free people shouldn't need licenses to arm themselves.|`|s9Pwnb87aa	No, but they should issue them all Lone Ranger cap pistols and hold mandatory firearm safety meetings for training purposes.|`|fKco44yxaa	So they can all shoot themselves? or what?<br>  <br>  Mate...think before you ask...there are no stupid questions...but this is close|`|5B6w8mxVaa	No.|`|8DMDTogvaa	No, why?|`|goe3y4FPaa	NO.. U NEED TO KEEP THEM ''GROUPIES'' AWAY.. AND THEM ''HATERZ'' FEEL ME ''DAWGZ''
Y31Ci8vlaa	You look like a best fan for manchester united.It seems you are the best fan in the world.Manchester united team players must be having a talk with you.
5xIroQjMaa	It's the evolution of wrestling, like any other sport (scripted or not). Andre the Giant didn't work out, he was naturally born that size. He used the size to secure for himself a career, but didn't hit the gym or undergo the workout regimine that people like Big Show go through nowadays. If you look at Andre's size, he had a much bigger frame than Big Show or Khali. Given modern training, he likely would have been far stronger than either of them, and given modern medicine, he probably would have lived much longer as well. it's called progress, and it's a beautiful thing.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	andre had a illness that made him bigger like the big show but khali haven't so he is normal but is 7ft 4in tall|`|dcNT65mTaa	At the time of Andre, he was really a shocker, to be so big at that day and age without steroids, and as in most sports, you can't teach a guy how to be tall so him being able to wrestle made him appealing just cause of that. Now you see large athletes a lot more so it's not as big an issue as in the past.
kxMQXhuAaa	No.|`|32a549cf7d2c0a7ee37a0b6d828d4f63aa	no ur only jealous|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	Soddin' bloody hell they are a football team  and therefore of no true consequence. Why don't you get a real life and just enjoy the game win or lose. What the hell is the matter with football fans|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	No. I think it's utterly ridiculous to hate a football team just because you support a different one. I don't know why this happens in football and nowhere else. You don't get fans of other sports behaving in that way; you don't get fans of one musical group hating fans of another.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	No , and neither should you - you're all from Liverpool - so why should you hate one another|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	1878 just about sums it all up <br>  <br>  good answer 1878|`|c65125310c801112d2ca421b6ef869edaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  1. Got us kicked out of Europe.<br>  2. will never take the blame for there wrong doings.<br>  3. Ian Rush.<br>  <br>  Everton F.C.|`|EyaqiWPwaa	i hate liver sandwiches....<br>  1 they suck<br>  2 they are liver-y<br>  3 bleh!! liver ewwww|`|03ac6f0f169cc0e4440ad1f8a6d78ed8aa	i dont hate liverpool i just think there soooo overated <br>  only interested to play in cup comps.<br>  they and man u have all the luck this season|`|AA11682444	i dont but my boyfriend does. we are going to see united and liverpool 14th march in old trafford! he,s a big united fan so hope they beat liverpool : )|`|RqkITQUiaa	liverpool are magic<br>  neverton are tragic|`|aGXankr2aa	No, we quite like Evertonians - McManaman, Fowler, Carragher.....|`|zD2NWrIzaa	LIVERPOOL are magic everton are tragic, enough said|`|AmKbvgmwaa	i dont hate them, i just dont support them, palace fan|`|7stgbWJyaa	I don't but they're playing Middlesbrough on Saturday, so they are the evil opposition!|`|oPYw0QYqaa	LFC Kopette<br>  LFC Kopette<br>  Rafa|`|MORVkjY6aa	i dont!
pl2SocVKaa	well the fresh cut helped kobe be better so yeah maybe|`|QwqmnuLhaa	no, having chauncey Billups instead of Allen Iverson again would help the Pistons|`|rqHKbubraa	AI's new hair playing for a different team would help the Pistons.|`|b55f0e519614a0b70ec04c08eb33d605aa	no, I think he needs a new tattoo.|`|GY3QTszgaa	YES a hair cut is the new way to win a championship<br>  <br>  bcuz we know that every hair cut change has drastically turned around dead franchises and turne them into title contenders.<br>  <br>  ALL THE HOURS OF PRACTICE IS MEANINGLESS, THE PLAYERS SHOULD JUST CHANGE HAIRSTYLES BCUZ THAT IS WHAT HELPS TEAMS WIN.<br>  <br>  THEREFORE I HOPE THE CLIPPERS PLAYERS GET MOHAWKS LOL|`|8pdMGoCSaa	the braids used to direct the wind around and through his head causing him to glide and whiz right past you. i think its slowing him down now because all that nappy hair is blocking the wind.|`|GvqOB5FLaa	right now nothings going to help the pistons. went from having the second best record in the league last season to fighting for there lives for an 8th seed in the east spot|`|cWsBSpQNaa	the hair doesnt really matter its how the team plays|`|NJ9qPuDqaa	NO the Pistons suck its all bout the CAVS|`|gtINkA19aa	yeah|`|BiMkowVMaa	Have you ever heard of Samson & Delilah?<br>  <br>  His hair was where his amazing strength came from. It was cut and he became weak and was captured and had his eyes burned out. <br>  <br>  Same with Iverson (minus the eyes being burnt out), His strength came from his hair.<br>  <br>  We may never see the same Iverson again.<br>  <br>  J/K...<br>  <br>  No. Getting a haircut isn't gonna help anyone unless it donated to Locks of Love.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Maybe
5de97489e8a440e9b2e1255938a501b5aa	go for it--im an AllStar cheerleader and i've only been a flyer once but my coach is gonna make me fly in a one man stunt--in 5'4 and weigh 117--so u should have no problem. if u really wanna be a flyer tell ur coach and see what he/she says.<br>  go for it...what do u have to lose?<br>  :]|`|nqBhFyt7aa	Go ahead. Im 110 and 5'5'' and a flyer. Just try and see [: Good luck|`|uKyfRzxIaa	you should try. it sorta depends on the bases and how strong and tall they are. . . . remember pretty much everyone wats to be a flyer.|`|D6vDOkqHaa	yeh you can be a flyer but make sure you bases are taller than you
6vzpHTqQaa	Underrated.<br>  <br>  He seems to get a double-double every night...that's David Lee territory.  He also hits threes, which is pretty good for a big man.  He and Granger form a pretty good combo.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Well,he's a great scorer and he does great things in the Pacers and he's a pretty good player|`|7bx2XQlqaa	He's very underrated, perhaps the most underrated big man in the game.  He can rebound (he's top five in the league right now), he can shoot, he can pass, he plays decent defense, and he doesn't get any pub.  I don't know why though.  He is very very talented.|`|cf097e014c6acfacb1c669aa3ee29effaa	Not very. Underrated players in the NBA are people like Travis Outlaw, Rudy Gay, Caron Butler, Luis Scola and Gerald Wallace. Murphy is a great role player but very little else.|`|HNQU9V6Haa	then how come they arent a playoff team then?
mQZDizMVaa	Are you enacting the role of Mabel Fairbanks?? Or are you videoing someone who's enacting Mabel?<br>  <br>  Please be specific so myself and others can help. Your question's confusing. Thanks.
sQdgzYKVaa	tell them it doesn't hurt to start off with. tell them you wont get too into guns. tell them the price and ratings. and good luck|`|D99bG1X5aa	tell them you can keep it at your grandparents house. I just got an airsoft gun because of that condition. Good Luck
AA11736969	yes, Haz. is a shortened version of the surname hernandez.
kivwSfpgaa	go to a sporting goods store and they will help find guards that fit properly.
9NDL5YQJaa	Where are you located?  You can swim in cold water, just not for very long before you get hypothermia.|`|XO16mAOhaa	I will go with the first guys answer about cold weather!!!|`|UHTcpdkVaa	It's safe to swim in many of them... and has been for a long time.  But it's impossible to say that all are ok.
MORVkjY6aa	if ur reaally good buy The Nike Mercurial Vapor SL Citron , if not buy The Nike Mercurial Vapor SL Pine Green ........ sl citron r really expensive...so u should be a good player :)|`|rJgrwIodaa	Nike sucks, get ADIDAS.  (In America, Puma and Kelmes are the best quality.)|`|oPYw0QYqaa	i have the Vapours in Berry and white (pink) and they are very good. they are very light which is great if your quick.. if you are not quick and are the kind of player that goes in for strong tackles dont buy them as you will break you feet... I am a winger and my pace is biggest attribute so i always buy light bots... I also have the Puma V1 08<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prodirectsoccer.com/prodinfo.asp?PID=PDS-002-010-738&DEPT=2&BRAND=10&SS=1&PROFILE=Speed" rel="nofollow">http://www.prodirectsoccer.com/prodinfo....</a><br>  <br>  These are much better than the nike vapours.. They are more comfortable and even lighter.. I only bought the Vapours cos they are pink!!!!  But if you ar going to go for the Vapours go for the Citron.. they look nicer
jGZb7xnDaa	Here is the dilemma.  Ray Lewis' highest worth is to the Ravens.  No other team will compensate Ray the way he wants.  That is, except for Dallas.  Dallas is known for breaking the bank on 1 player.  <br>  <br>  Ozzie Newsome will let Ray test the free agency waters, and bring back any deals he gets.  The Ravens will then have to decide whether or not the want to match or beat that deal.  In all likely hood, Ray is gone.  Ozzie has always be known for signing the right guy at the right price.  Ray''s price tag is simply just too high at this point.<br>  <br>  Face facts, there will come a day, whether by free agency or retirement that the Ravens will be without Ray Lewis.  And when that day comes, they will still line up 11 on defense.  It isn't as if they will be playing without a MLB when Ray is gone.|`|HMv6jvUCaa	No I can't see him leaving the Ravens|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Friday is the first day of free agency. I think that if Ray isn't signed by then that he will end up elsewhere Dallas? Jets?|`|9RPqWxuhaa	Id say there's about a fifty percent chance. He is most valuable to the Ravens, and they probably want him most. I think the only other real option would be dallas, but theyd have to offer him big money, and thats something that they dont have. I think ray's just acting like he's gonna leave to get money from the ravens, but I see him back in B'more, unless he asks for a ridiculously high salary.|`|Zd1TbyLnaa	no i don't think so he's going to get picked up by some one else the ravens aren't going to want to pay him what he's worth to their team and some one else will like SD would be a nice fit with Merriman and Phillips wouldn't that be the best LB compialation of all time|`|ySjHowZqaa	the nfl network media is makin it seem like he is leavin da ravens but the "Baltimore sun" is hinting dat ray will stay wit da ravens<br>  <br>  the baltimore sun is a newspaper in baltimore|`|JhrdIVBgaa	No he is leaving.<br>  The media is making it seem like he is going to end up in Dallas.<br>  I don't really know if it trues but, as a cowboy fan, I sure hope it is.|`|7PMuY5ibaa	Yes he will. He became a superstar there and really helped out the city of Baltimore. He's not stupid enough to make the same choice as Warren Sapp and leave the team where he got a Super Bowl Ring. I know everyone thinks he's gone but he's here to stay and this is coming from a MAJOR Baltimore Ravens fan.|`|goe3y4FPaa	THE RAVENS.. SUCK.. U NEED GOOD.. QB.. GOOD DEFENSE AND OFFENSE.. TO WIN A SUPERBOWL.. HE SHOULD GO TO THE ''RAIDERS'' I WANT THEM TO WIN A DAMN SUPERBOWL.. FOR ONCE.. FEEL ME 'DAWG'S???|`|fKco44yxaa	NOOOOOPE<br>  <br>  :D|`|J6grdba3aa	no. espn reports that dallas is pretty serious ab picking him up.|`|YFFhkRSdaa	no he will be back u can't replace ray lewis
sBrummATaa	here ya go, they are all in categories <a href="http://golf.about.com/od/rulesofgolf/a/golfrules.htm" rel="nofollow">http://golf.about.com/od/rulesofgolf/a/g...</a>|`|W2R8TRDmaa	With only a couple insignificant exceptions, the pga tour plays by the USGA rules.  They are not hard to find. They are on the internet if you can't find a booklet.|`|D1oakfJTaa	Do you mean the official rules of golf? Because I think the USGA puts out a booklet every year with all the rules, including the revisions. Otherwise, there has to be a way to find it all online.
jnc6qA6jaa	Who would give you that assignment? Nobody knows on earth, unless they look at his records from the 90s. There is house shows, ppvs, normal shows, and even a private show if your rich enough. Its impossible to tell. Some of his house show matches never got the results on the internet. Nobody will know, except maybe himself.|`|GExKoh1Gaa	he has a decent record compared to wankertaker who cant put anyone over.|`|mB2dDIFAaa	29-67
3dW0GQNYaa	Two Torino torches, one unused and the other used, recently sold for $780.01 and $969.15 respectively on eBay.  That price has come down from the $1400-$2500 these torches were selling for shortly after the Games ended via various selling sources.|`|rsJM6Oxbaa	I couldn't tell you how much you would get for that Torch. But I know it would be a Lot!<br>  <br>  I actually have a Question for you. See it has been my biggest dream to one day run the Olympic Torch! And I was just wondering how you became chosen to be a Torch Bearer? Please tell me What I need to do to be Chosen!!|`|suzbS0H0aa	Doubt wether these items come up for sale very often, if at all.Assuming you have a legitimate ownership and relevant papers to prove authenticity then it will be worth whatever a collector is prepared to pay.In your mind you will probably have a figure so why not try it on Ebay with a fixed reserve-it could surprise you!!!
d9tCS7BPaa	I agree that it has gotten much better with the HHH/Orton feud and the HBK/Taker feud.    Cena/Edge/Big Show....meh....decent. Not awesome.    Where do I see C.M. Punk going? Well, I imagine that Vince pulled the plug on his title run last year b/c he wasn't 'over' enough with the fans. I see a possible heel turn for C.M Punk if Vince gets smart about things and responds to the huge heat Punk received for winning the title over Christian. Either that or Punk may return to ECW in hopes of trying to revive the show's ratings. I don't think the WWE things C.M Punk is ready for a big title run. But if they DO want to go that direction, I see a C.M Punk/Edge feud in the future. Ideally Edge is a good candidate to put Punk over. They are similar in stature and size.|`|plcVbZoDaa	They aren't going anywhere with anything. Wrestlemania is a spectucal not meant to really lead into the direction of the company. I'm telling ya guys, they just wanted to be unpredictable tonight and besides Cena winning they accomplished it.     IE Punk will lose that MITB..if he doesn't he will be the first to cash it in and lose.|`|nnwdpCG6aa	After witnessing Orton lost, i have lost faith in WWE..   i was going to let the other things pass. just hoping one day, the WWE would not waste  Orton's given talent. and for once realize he is the perfect wrestler and to let him carry the company. but it never happen. all those months of making  Orton look perfect, has come to nothing    I hope  someone  beats CM Punk, to take away his money in the bank Title shot. even though i do not mind him winning.. i just don't want to see him  win the World Title, the same way he won the last one. bottom line i'm disappointed  in WWE. plus i am not looking forward to seeing Cena as champion. i mean he already was champion two months ago    Seeing the same champions is getting boring|`|zm5RYyVHaa	There will be a week of rematches or non storyline matches then the draft when all get restructured for new storylines. That's what happens every year.|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	I honestly see Punk turning heel. It's the only thing that really makes sense for him to win two years in a row. CM Punk was a better heel anyhow.
Veptmodnaa	Didnt go but watched Mighty Hammers v Hull on TV  and just booked tickets for Hammers v Baggies game in March . My yearly trip to the smoke!

AA10896470	Hell no he shouldn't be. He's served his time and he's been PETA's punching bag even before his sentencing. And I think it's messed up that he goes through this while rapists and some murderers go through less harsh times than Vick does. Even Michael Jackson doesn't go through this much flak!!! P-E-T-A can go to H-E-L-L.|`|RAjycr4waa	PETA is a terrorist organization. All of its members are psychotic and he has done his time so all is forgiven. Be sure that he will play again but he will have a lot more to deal with before the media lets him move on because they are pathetic and will do anything to get themselves ahead. But if Vick can come back and be a very good player then you will see the criticism start to fade pretty fast.|`|AA12103453	When was Ray Lewis CONVICTED of murder again? Man hope he doesn't see this, he could sue you for slander(he wouldn't, BUT he could). Anyway no murders aren't treated less harsh, and I don't think convicted rapists are either. Do you really think you could compare Vick to being on a Sex Offender's List? I agree back before then that he would be getting treated more harsh, but not now. As to Murders it really depends on the degree of murder. They could be in prison FOR LIFE. Vick TORTURED dogs, and torturing animals smaller then you is a sign of a sociopath. He deserves most of what he gets. He did this FOR YEARS, and the Humane Society was after him. I agree that PETA is a bunch of idiots after a photo-op, but the Humane Society was the ones trying to get him shut down and the ones that went in and tried to rescue the dogs. PETA showed up after it was all over and went to the trial and does whatever they can to get their names in the paper.    Actually this IS published, Yahoo Answers would qualify. Also you should learn the definition of slander. You claimed he did something he didn't do to other people, that is slander. People READ this so you are telling others. Perhaps you are thinking of LIBEL, not SLANDER. Funny how you think I need to learn the law and you don't know it.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	The same people that crucified Vick,gave Mark Mcguire a pass.What,s the 411 on that.Maybe it,s the color of your skin not what you did.I just don,t see too many white guys grilled on anything,are they all angels.Don,t hate this is the truth.If Vick was white PETA would of looked the other way.It,s not what you did it,s who you are.If you don,t agree I really don,t care,this is what I believe.|`|LqLs6otzaa	Regardless of what is "fair" people do what they want.  You are seeing what I see all of the time.  Look at abortion.  People are FINE with killing unborn babies.  Unborn babies are helpless, just like animals.  But, they turn a blind eye to that.  So, I can actually see the warped view of people that think rapists/murders are better.  This is what they are told.  Abortion is ok, but we need to protect animals, trees, the ozone.  I don't understand why we can't protect ALL of those things.  But, yes, I think serving time should be sufficient.|`|1Byis7Flaa	So, profound:  O.J Simpson not guilty of double homicide, but is serving time in Vegas for a future TV drama illustrated by his friend who did not get charged with anything and earned $250,000 at the end of the day for the tape recordings  Ray Lewis- Murder (body was in the trunk of his car)  Kobe- charged with rape in CO. paid the girl a million dollars, and she did not appear on the witness stand so the charges were dropped.  (But Kobe and his new publicity is second to none)  A girl goes to a hotel room at mid-night and Mike Tyson gets busted on rape    Vick should not be crucified. And should go to Korea for a PR stunt to perform community service by a huge free dog BBQ to help the poor    And yes, I agree many rapists and murders are treated better then Vick.    Look at Bush ($350 billion scam)  Obama ($350 billion +  today another $850 billion)  two huge rapists|`|oeyurWLoaa	**** no he's done his ******* time, get off his dick already|`|tWUQU4Juaa	If your taking a vote put me down for a " YES " .

Just because he's stupid and there are a lot of other stupid people who commit crimes is no excuse . He's a piece of sh*t and therefore should live the life of a piece of sh*t .

nqdDe3cJaa	get real.  they didnt have Kobe or Ariza for OT yesterday.  Lakers will be just fine.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	they will still win the west. but they do need best record.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	It's definitely going to start getting more difficult.  The Celtics began their slide when they went on their West Coast swing.  Losing to the Bobcats at home is not the way you want to kick off a road trip.   They really haven't been tested at all yet.  The Lakers have played the fewest road games in the NBA thus far.  27 home games and 17  on the road.  And 2 of those "road games" were against the Clippers in their home arena.  The Lakers play 24 of their final 38 games are on the road.  I think this schedule which has favored them so heavily in the first half is really going to be a signifcant detriment in the second phase of the season.  It should make for some interesting games.  I'm looking forward to seeing how the Lakers handle it.  I'm not predicting a downfall, but it's not going to be easy.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	umm i really hope they have a downfall...and i think theres a good chance that they will|`|i5MInqeMaa	No way.  I hate the Lakers very much, but 1 loss to under 500 team isn't the beginning of anything.  Since the Lakers are so far the best team in the West by far, i don't see that changing.  Even if they split this road trip or have a slump like the celtics.  That's why i don't put to much stock into the regular season.  People think the Lakers are going down after every loss they have this season.|`|AsvVWfiHaa	NO.  the Lakers are still a very good road team at 12-5...and i still believe that they are experiencing a transition period with Gasol and Bynum finding ways to simultaneously exist in the triangle offense.  PLUS, Bynum is coming along and will definitely be a force come playoffs.  no downfall here...good question tho.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Well they arent beating Cleveland coming up, I know that much, and once they travel to Boston it is going to be a **** show, think game 6 all over again|`|ivbnPxSKaa	wow. they are the best team in the nba. get over it    sorry they cant win eevry frickin game but dont battle for the best record int he nba every day...|`|ClQ9yJweaa	I dont see how despite not being on road much. Only major injuries can hurt this team, at the moment, and dont see it happening. Ipersonally cant stand them, but the rest of The Mighty West are playing simply, just to get to the Western Finals to face them. Not even my Spurs will beat them. Certainly not with a Big Man in the paint anyway, and no matter hw good their D is. Lakers have it on all ends, though better D would and could put them on top of their eventual eastern Final foe.|`|22db381533271ec62bd08dac9ba113bfaa	I highly doubt it. Even though I hate to admit it, the Lakers are the best team in the West. Especially, with Bynum improving. They might even be the best in the league. However, it's anyone's game in the Finals. I predict a Lakers Vs Celtics rematch.|`|lbQYYHMbaa	I would suspect you go back at least 12 words on your sentence to correct blatant errors.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	its one lose, theyve had trouble with the bobcats for couple years now.  theyre not on a downfall, theyre still the top team in the west and i just dont see the spurs catching them recordwise at this point.  i see them losing about 8-10 more.|`|aw9cmcwxaa	no

9RPqWxuhaa	Ed Reed: i dont kno about him being the greatest ever in his position. he's definitely in the top five, maybe top three, but not the best. However, in my opinion, he does have the best ability to make a play after he gets the ball in his hands.<br>  <br>  Ray lewis: Based on his playing, probably not. However, Ray Lewis' greatness expands beyond the field, as he is one of the best leaders in the NFL. During his prime, he played like one of the best, but his spiritual support and leadership raises him higher, so yes he may be the greatest ever to play the game.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I think this says it all.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUs9fElWhlM&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUs9fElWh...</a>|`|Oes7TRNVaa	NO but i will put them both in the top 5.|`|J3kfQtViaa	Do you have a baltimore bias?|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	Best safety I ever saw was a veteran Ronnie Lott.

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure i'm just as big a fan of TNA as i am of WWE.Both promotions are just as impotant and valid in the world of pro wrestling.But right now TNA is becoming my favorite brand as the matches, feuds, storylines and comedy elements are both very entertaining and exciting !|`|nKSmgjylaa	Don't you think you're being just a tweencie bit, shall we say, sterotypical? I am a WWE fan, and I also love TNA. The Heavyweight Division isn't great at the moment, MEM v. FrontLines getting old now. The X Division, Tag Division and Knockouts Divisions are amazing though. I love some of the HW wrestlers as well, but they're not being used correctly. So in future, get your facts right, please. I absolutely adore wrestling of any kind, and I most certainly don't "avoid TNA like Dracula avoiding the sun."  By the way, notice how most people who dissed TNA haven't seen it, or at least a few weeks episodes of it, ever?  (:|`|GKJV2EBSaa	That's not true.I am a wwe fan and tna fan.TNA has great storylines(Main event Mafia and Frontline storyline)and they use wrestlers to there potential.Matt Morgan for example never really was used by the wwe to his potential.And now that tna is using him right and using him to his potential,people know his name.Also they give wwe veterans a new start and there knockouts are hardcore and can actually wrestle.But the wwe is great too.They have top wrestlers like John Cena and Randy Orton.And mostly all wrestlers(including TNA wrestlers)have worked for wwe and made their career in the WWE.|`|NRs72Afxaa	Lol Wwe fans make the dumbest exuse. Mainly people are siding with the company that has been around longer. It's going to take time before people start to get into Tna more. It's only been around for about 6 1/2 years.    People will get into the product it just has to take time.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	It's not, I appreciate TNA, but am a bigger fan of WWE|`|41WXZPnCaa	I Really Think    For The Simple Fact That They Like Show Not Good Wrestling    Also For WWE Fans It's Hard 2 C MMA|`|EbTtmXViaa	Apparently because TNA is somehow more horrible then WWE.|`|yKBsB4Dyaa	I DON'T WATCH TNA BUT I HERE PEOPLE SAYIN THAT IT SUCKS  SO.... I DON'T KNOW|`|PAhdlQ5eaa	Possibly because TNA has aging wrestlers, people who already had their time in the spotlight.  I know that they have many young up an commers, but, some of the gimmicks are super lame.  I mean come on, Shark Boy? And they are trying to recreate the NWO again with the Main Event Mafia, and most of the people in the MEM, were also in the NWO.      To me, TNA is just like a rehash of WCW.  Lots of gimmicks.  Sure they are an alternative, but that doesn't make it an awesome product.    IMO, WCW was far better than TNA.  And ECW was a million times better back in its earlier years when the matches had "extreme rules".  ECW could be so much better if it went back to how it was.      It's going to take alot of years for TNA to get to the status of being a major contender in the wrestling world.  Plus they are going to have to deal with ROH coming to TV, and I would much rather watch a ROH show than a TNA show.|`|6LQNK51uaa	I m a wrestling fan and hates to sort my self as a fan of particular promotion..I love every type of wrestling promotion(if it serves wrestling matches and not some daredevil acts like XPW).    The fact is TNA fans(cough..I mean the fans who hates WWE)does and says the same thing about WWE.|`|wosSPy0Taa	wtf TNA is not even close to the WWE most of TNA starts are midcard wrestlers on WWE so why is da hell would any WWE fan want to apreciate TNA    oh and TNA can't even compete with ECW ratings|`|Rb2M6bDdaa	i like TNA because they're doing what WWE doesn't want to do anymore like extreme matches because WWE today is more like targeting kids viewers & they're way gone mainstream. i thank TNA because even WCW & ECW's gone they're bringin back the good ol REAL DEAL wrestling..what im trying to say here is that when it comes to attitude TNA has more guts..like the Attitude Era.|`|zb40cLwOaa	I dig TNA, but sometimes they try too hard to be like WWE. They have great wrestlers they need to focus on them and not stupid storylines.|`|zOw0Ta5Oaa	its maybe because many wwe fans grew up watching wwe and are use to seeing the same wrestling show over and over so theyre use to seeing undertaker, hhh, hbk, and other wwe superstars, i know a few wwe fans that like tna a bit better than wwe, and you're right wwe is just consentrating on a few superstars like cena and batista when they have way beter talent this is y i think wwe is not god as it use to be around the attitude era. some wwe fans should try watching different wrestling promos before i was like roh sucks but when i watched it i was really exiting, and since i like lucha libre more i didnt waht to watch JPW cause i thought it was wack but i  watched it and liked it so wwe fans should watch other wrestling promos it like u rsaying "i dont like Burger King but when they try it theyre like WOW"    Also it good for TNA to not concentrate or relly one a few superstars so then in the future when god tna superstars quit or retire tna know they have more wrestlers that the odience like so they know theyre not going out of business|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	when i do finally get by the dumb *** ring that don West is the most annoying voice in wrestling i'd rather listen to jillian sing
6of3tqHhaa	Because she won two tournaments right before coming into the Australian Open.|`|e26a6d1bc492d2de7a8edcc3478c5300aa	Nothing against Dementieva's accomplishments as I believe anyone playing at their level of tennis should be respected.  Here comes the but.  All this hype only adds pressure to her game and makes Serena look like the underdog who just so happens to be a Rottweiler.  Go figure.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	she's not the favorite, but she's playing really well.  i'm hoping for an elena dinara final|`|zN0orpp3aa	She is the favorite because she won 2 warm-up events prior to the Australian Open. I partially agree with you. I think she'll beat Serena tonight and lose to Vera in the final.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	I don't believe Dementieva is a strong contender. She easily defeated Suarez-Navarro at the 1/4 finals. Navarro wasn't ready technically or mentally to go further than that as yet, her nerve prob blinded against seasoned older Dementieva...Now Dem. faces Serena, a much tougher opponent, although Serena struggled in earlier matches. Dementieva will be dismissed by Serena at the semis, IMO. I haven't got a clue how Dementieva was able to hold the Olympics Trophy... toss and turns of tennis irony ?|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i think ultimately serena has alot more to bring to the table definently bigger weapons mainly on the serve and forehand...and typically is much mentally tougher..    but i think we are seeing a very different demeteva.. she is more trianed, more relaxed more sure of herself.. and she is ready to take things to the next leveal.... i don't think this is going to be a clean win for serena if she is to win..    i say demeteve has a good chance to post the big upset here..|`|agHUvyAtaa	Because she is in the best form for the tournament. She has already won 15 consecutive matches this year and two titles where she beat Serena Williams in the semis of Medibank international.  I think this year may be her year.  I think she has trained hard and has a new determinated attitude and is not so nervous (showing)    Definately a threat to Serena!|`|LKVTY2EPaa	I wouldn't say she is the favorite. I think Serena has been the favorite the entire aussie open. However, she is playing the best tennis of her career right now and is in really great shape. But as you have mentioned, she hasn't proven herself at a grand slam and this is her time to prove herself. Like Serena said, the pressure is on Dementieva to win this year, and as much as I like her, I think she will crumble again. But I would be really excited and respect her if she wins.

oYf3jSq6aa	First It only pertains to semi auto weapons with detachable magazines with the exception of semi auto shotguns with fixed mags greater than 5 rounds    It prohibits any rifle with two or more evil features  Folding stock  Pistol grip  Bayo or bayo lug  Threaded barrel or flash suppressor  Grenade launcher    Any pistol with two or more  Magazine that does not fit into the grip frame  Threaded barrel  Heat shield on barrel  Unloaded weight of 50 oz or more  Is a semi auto version of a full auto pistol    Any shotgun with two or more  Folding or collapsible stock  Pistol grip  capacity of five or more rounds (fixed mag)  Detachable magazine    High cap mag will be banned from manufacture or importation  The guns they fit in will not be banned it will just be illegal to won new made high cap magazines  You can keep and sell what you have  There just wont be any new stuff|`|0cLj35Fgaa	Basically, the ban covers semi-automatic rifles, shotguns with detachable magazines, shotguns that can hold more than 5 rounds, high capacity magazines (greater than 10 rounds), rifles with pistol grips, folding stocks, bayonet mounts, and flash suppressors.  Basically, they want to outlaw a lot of great guns that normal people use for sporting purposes.|`|AA12243350	the previous AWB, which expired, outlawed certain firearms with certain features (ones the liberals got all twisted up over) like flash suppressors, pistol grips, extended mags etc, and the manufacture of high capacity mags (over 10 rounds). This meant that you could keep the ones you already had, and could buy ones made prior to the ban, but no more could be made or imported. This is why mag prices sky rocketed, as did the listed firearms. Currently, there is no AWB, although the new adminstration is the most anti gun ever elected, and has already stated that it will be brought back, with new firearms added, and no expiration date. My advice? buy now, buy quick, and buy lots!!  shoot safe|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	The concept of the AWB was developed by Bill Ruger, Sr. of the Ruger company as a way to appease lawmakers into not banning his Mini-14 and 10/22 product line. He suggested the 10 round max capacity as the magazine limit.     The previous incarnation of the law was written in part by now White House Cheif of Staff Rham Emmanuel, Obama's right-hand man.     Since there is no such thing as an "Assault Weapon", it can and will cover everything they think they can put in there.|`|U0qmWhDlaa	You all seem to be comparing what might be , to what was...    Big mistake... If a new AWB passes ( and I am still not sure it will) it could be ANYHTING from otlawing possession of certian features, Outlawing transfer , or new manufacture... Who knows WHAT they will have when they finally get the bill to Barry Soteoro's desk....
OVQ4CGTvaa	interesting article. Tyson is one of the biggest draws of the century. despite his bad behavior and actions outside the ring alot people will pay to see tyson for one last time.the guy was a relentless fighter people luv to see that type fighters.   although i know this fight should been done 8 years ago... i wouldn't mind seeing it now . although it will probably suck. im pretty sure he'll  have some ppv success obviously not like before but he probably earn himself a good paycheck.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	I dont think any boxing fans are going to pay to see it, you might get some of your circus fans or mma type fans to shell out for it, but If he did have a ppv it would have little or nothing to do with boxing, as far as boxing he is done, no comeback, Th-th-th-that's all folks!     Mike Tyson's best bet to make money is to sell his name, write a book and make appearances, Tyson maybe one of the most knowledgeable people in boxing when it comes to knowledge of boxers of the past, his knowledge of the sport's history is immense. Possibly become a commentator. Instead of fighting its time for him to work on his image, a comeback of a different type.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	With the pitiful level of competition among today's heavyweights, I think Mike Tyson could be champion again.  There is no possible way Wladimir Klitschko would ever step into the ring with Mike Tyson, but if he did, I think Mike would knock Wlad out.  Either way, Mike would definitely make some money on a comeback win or lose.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	I bet he could make one more big purse taking on a guy in one of the other MMA leagues - not the UFC.    If Kimbo Slice can become a huge draw through "highlight" film of him beating up people, Tyson could still be a huge draw for the sheer entertainment value he produces in a build up.    Put him in against a middle of the road slugger in MMA and he'd make a quick million.

By paul faking the injury it helped him make his shots and it made the lakers miss shots.  Plus GAsol was so traumatized by the faking that he played soft.  Laker fans are hypcorites.  They hate all the Kobe haters and laker haters, but you question proves that they do the exact same thing with paul pierce.|`|XrCc85kNaa	Well...  The only reason you aren't talking trash is because you know McGrady will never make it out of the finals.....

They say he fake's injuirys.....that doesnt explain why the lakers lost...|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	because Lakers fans STILL haven't forgiven Paul Pierce for giving Kobe Bryant a new tattoo on his rear end as a present... it's a tattoo of a footprint! Lakers fans love to trash talk to compensate for their inadequacy.

Blaming a loss on the injury of a player on the other team is just ridiculous and makes no sense at all. Most of those haters are Laker fans who just want an excuse to bail out their team. They don't even know what Pierce is like so they don't have any grounds to talk trash bout him.|`|PjFLDSmdaa	I never had a problem with Pierce. The injury thing didn't bother me at all, and I didn't think he faked it either. But then when he called himself the best player in the world? Are you serious? What an arrogant comment to make, especially when it's nowhere near true. That comment just pissed me off.

bB5d5YVeaa	I used to think that it would be a good back-up career move.  But, I no longer think that anymore.    When I took martial arts classes (30 years ago), it was pretty simple.  Nowadays, you MUST have insurance and just paying those insurance premiums are going to be a bear.  Add to this the fact that people these days are "sue happy" and you can understand why it's an uphill climb.    I was pretty much out of the martial arts scene but had a housemate that was a full-time instructor (3rd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do).  One day he came home and was very very upset.  The reason?  The mother of a small girl took him aside and said she thought she saw him touching her daughter in an inappropriate manner.  I knew this guy, and there was absolutely no way he was into anything like that at all.  But, my friend really enjoyed being a good instructor and mentor to all those kids (and many adults).  When this woman implied that he was "that type of person" it was the most personal insult imaginable.    I don't want to geeze too much here.  But, I just can't imagine trying to teach young people today.  When I was young (yeah, that phrase) people had some respect for authority figures.  These days, it's eroded.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Every new student is a stranger to a Sensei regardless of if they know them or not. If you carry friendships, relationships into the dojo it can create an atmosphere of favoritism which is not permitted at a good school.    I never planned on teaching Karate but helped my Sensei from 1986-1991 run his school because I cared about our dojo and wanted to do my part. In 1992 I opened my own dojo on his bequest and enjoyed every minute of it...good or bad...but I still don't think I am that good of an instructor...for some reason the community believes in me so I am happy to teach everyone...stangers or not...that can stand our classes (we are very traditional).|`|LPJcNXMVaa	I actually don't.The reason why is because I live in Brooklyn and the children I would plan to teach(5th-10th)are very rude.Also because I don't plan on being a teacher.I would actually teach the younger kids like maybe 4-7 years old.I would plan on opening something but its not a school.I would plan on opening a dance or music class.For students that aren't doing anything and are just hanging out on the street.  This would be a great opportunity for children that don't want to be home and just want to go somewhere were its different.  I don't think there are many things like that for children in Brooklyn this would keep them out of troubl    Hope this helps|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	been there done that and never again.to much bs and theres no money in it,not that i taught for money anyway but it is nice to at least break even.which didnt happen very often especially after the insurance went up dramaticly after 911.  now i just train different mas and when i train at home i teach my kids and there friends bits and pieces but not full on.|`|sj902Wyuaa	yes, actually.

cowRdp0jaa	no.just buy a lighter bullet in that caliber.sometimes you can use sabots with lighter bullets,but i'd buy them!!|`|AA11694178	Sabots can be used ONLY in rifles having a fast rate of twist.  Barrels with slow twist rates will not stabilize the sabotted bullets and accuracy will be terrible.  If you have one of the modern in-line muzzleloaders, they will have a fast twist rate that is correct for sabotted bullets.  In that case, you can simply select lighter bullets to go into your sabots.  On the other hand, if you have a rifle that is designed to shoot round balls, you will not be able to shoot smaller or lighter bullets.  The rifle will only shoot spherical bullets that are slightly smaller in diameter than the bore of the rifle.  There is no way to significantly alter the weight of a round ball.  You can change the alloy mix from which the bullet is made.  By doing so, the weight will vary but not significantly.|`|4MmGydYAaa	buy a lighter bullet, and use a sabot
3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	TI makes one:|`|xWApXu8Aaa	The type of brass catchers that attach to the round hand guards of AR-15 rifles with a velcro strip will also work with most any autoloading rifle.  http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/ARR033-7....|`|AA11694178	I think there may be such a thing but I have no idea who would have it.  You might look at such places as Cabela's, Bass Pro, Midsouth Shooter's Supply, Natchez Shooters Supplies or Brownell's.  All of them have websites that you can find on line.  Another possibility is to take a broom and dustpan with you and just sweep up your brass if you are shooting on a paved surface such as at a range.  Most of the nicer ranges have someone who comes around and sweeps up the brass for you.  The range recycles it and they get an income from it.  If you are shooting on an unpaved area, you can just leave it lay and it will eventually corrode and return to the earth.  .22 rimfire brass is so small that it is of no consequence if left on the ground.  However, if you prefer to catch it as it is ejected, try one of the places that I mentioned for a brass catcher for your 10/22.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Have you tried a blanket or a tarp?     As long as your recoil spring is in decent shape, it should catch all/most of the brass.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	i've seen the brass catchers your talking about. but i don't think they ever made one for a .22 because it's not reloadable so nobody saves the brass.|`|afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	When we shoot at a friend's house he has a 8'x10' tarp we put on the ground by the benchrest. When we're down we just fold it and all the spent .22 brass is easy to pick up with none left in the yard.

vSGR1HMDaa	Steelers vs Cardinals     Its going to be a rough February 1, 2009 against two of the best teams in the 2009 superbowl.

I personally would like to see the Cardinals win.  I think their defense has stepped up in a big way.  Between the Cardinals and Steelers, who had the most turnovers in the playoffs with 12?  Hard to believe, but it was the Cardinals.  The Cardinals have a team firing on all cylinders.  This team has proven itself and has only one thing in mind.......Win.  Many Steeler fans think this will be a walk in the park.  No problem.  I say go ahead and underestimate them just like the Falcons, Panthers, and Eagles did.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	okay, before kurt warner came to arizona, he had 2 nfl mvps, 2 superbowl appearances and 1 superbowl ring!  how is that a cinderella story?  that's like saying brett favre and tom brady are still cinderella stories.    also, the cardinals are the oldest franchise, and the original franchise of professional football in america, so it's not as if they just showed up.  they have a couple of titles.  they've been to the ball before, it's just that the last time they were invited was 1947.|`|dPbZeAYVaa	Not a Cardinals fan...but i wanna see them SMOKE the Steelers.|`|c17x6L4baa	No. Cinderella had it given to her.

Txg9giQfaa	Sure, a regular road bike with aero bars will be fine.    The benefit of an actual TT bike isn't really noticeable until 25mph, so unless you're averaging around 30mph during your races you won't see a whole lot of difference.    Once you near pro level you can go for the dedicated TT bike :)|`|Z5xgSATSaa	A road bike can be set up to be a very good tt bike. However, it may no longer be very good to use as a regular road bike. You have to modify the saddle position, and you might also need a different stem. If you are going to use the bike exclusively for time trials there will be no problem. You could also use a time trial bike for triathlons, but if you want to set it up for optimum triathlon performance, it may no longer be legal for time trials. I won a lot of time trials on a steel road bike that I set up with good aero bars and wheels at distances up to 100 km.|`|CttL3LmBaa	It is more the rider than the machine - to a point.      If your bike is "very good" match it and become a very good rider.  You don't need Aero Bars, but they are more comfortable than staying on the drops for an entire Tri or Time Trial.      If I were beginning Tri, I would just clamp on a set of Aero Bars to my road bike to see how good I am before investing in a dedicated machine.        EDIT:  Where is Silverbullet on this?  Did you start with a road bike?|`|JSGLKnA4aa	sure why not. i used my specialized allez pro for TT. till you get sponsors to pay for new specific race bike.

Just think about what they used to wear!!!|`|kYBlgFQAaa	Obviously your frame of reference doesn't go back to the 80's.  I'll start getting worried when I see a player wearing a pair of "John Stockton's".|`|fB4RfiCgaa	What are you Amish? I think you're using the word drastically a little too lightly.|`|jSk6PjAPaa	I think they have gotten shorter but they still are long. The players finally realized that to dribble the ball between ur legs u cant have shorts down to ur ankles|`|aPr7ADGgaa	old shorts were but not anymore|`|Nuj1eScCaa	I don't think they're too short. They aren't too long either. I'm not trying to sound like John Stockton here nor am I promoting "John Stockton shorts", but if some players shorts get any longer they're going to be tripping on the court and losing the ball when they try to dribble through their legs.    Stockton's shorts may have been short, but how often did he turn the ball over?... That's why he wore them that way.

OiAl6w48aa	There's a ton of resorts at Lake Tahoe (both in California and Nevada).  Let's see, here's the big ones:    1.  Heavenly.  Its known as a more intermediate / light expert resort.  The terrain is predominantly intermediate to single black diamond, and largely consists of groomed runs.  It also has some good tree skiing and a couple of steep runs right on the California side of the mountain (Gunbarrel, for instance).  Crowds tend to be the worst at Heavenly given its proximity to South Lake and the casinos.    2.  Squaw Valley is the next most famous resort at Tahoe.  Its known as a more predominantly expert mountain.  There are more cliffs, chutes, steeps, and mogul fields than any other mountain at Tahoe.  It also has a very good terrain park (but it can get very, very busy), as well as some terrific off-snow activities such as cross country skiing, horseback riding, bungee jumping, ice skating, etc.  If you were looking to go one place on vacation and then not have to go anywhere else, Squaw would be the ticket.    3.  Boreal is "the" snowboarding mountain at Tahoe.  If I remember correctly, it was also the first mountain to allow snowboarding.  I haven't been there in years, but from what I understand, they have the best snowboard park of any mountain at Tahoe.      4.  Alpine Meadows is another popular one, and has only allowed snowboarders for the past several years (it was the last mountain at Tahoe to remain "skiiers only").  Alpine has long been known as a good technical mountain that has good steeps and long groomed runs.  A lot of very successful ski racers have come from Alpine.      Finally, there's a bunch of other smaller resorts around the area: Homewood, Diamond Peak, Mt. Rose, etc.  These are all intermediate to beginner mountains, but make up for it with good grooming, small crowds and decent ticket prices.|`|Hsyjt3wTaa	I don't know of any resorts in california but i know about whistler canada.

LIKkt8djaa	Well the burton hero is a nice board, the only thing that's iffy to me is the ICS system. I've heard one too many bad things about it, One it tends to loosen frequently and two because it's a long strip down the middle of the board it actually creates a larger dead zone on the board then a normal binding setup would do.. Other then that a nice board.<br>  <br>  Word of advice on burton though they tend to go more for style then quality, specially when it comes to their clothing, since you didn't list the tech specs on the jacket I have no clue of it's quality. but if it's one of the few quality items from burton then you it should have atleast 10k waterproofing and breathability.|`|q2TOb6unaa	Nice setup but very expensive. The board is good but the boots and jacket you should switch out. Burton outerwear sucks so I would check out companies like 686, Special Blend, DC, Quiksilver and Foursquare. As for boots, if you like stiff boots like the driver X the Salomon Malamute is probably the best stiff boot on the market. Other than that, it's pretty sick. <br>  <br>  The goggles would probably be my favourite since they are custom and have the polarized lenses.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	I'm not saying this disrespect you but your setup is probably the most over-priced setup on the market. Now, assuming you got a really good deal, I'm guessing about $1100-1300 for everything? Maybe more? <br>  <br>  Coming from someone that has boarded for over 15 years and if you ask any real snowboarder how they feel about Burton you'll get feedback about how they used to be good and how they've been shaving quality while racking up the $$ signs. if you don't believe me go to any reputable independently rated website that reviews boards and they'll say the same thing.<br>  <br>  If you have that money to burn, keep the goggles...get a different brand jacket (North Face is the best on the market, and it's been proven for the $$), get the k2 podium...it's gotten the best reviews out of all boards on the market, and it's all terrain, if you don't like flows, go with the new ride contrabands, and for boots, haters can say what they want but the most comfortable boot on the market are 32's and vans...you can get the 32 focus boas if you want easy and customizable, or the vans cirro...both are on the high end of the price spectrum but the comfort is ridiculous, and say what you want about boas i ride hard and they haven't snapped on me. If you insist on laces, get the Vans Andreas Wiig
ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	take lessons i tried to teach my self and found it was not as easy as i thought it looked i was on the ground more then anything Else took some lessons and now i just fly down the Mountain.i used to be a lift attendant at one of our local ski areas i knew how to ski and watching the boarders get off  the lift and go down the hill looked EASY so i tried it and found it was not as easy as it looked so i took lessons and once you learn how it is kind of easy.|`|98bupiDFaa	Don't waste your time on lessons...I wouldn't even waste time on the bunny hill.  Just make sure you're going down green-circle runs on the mountain...if you don't know what this is you will understand when you get to the mountain.      Since it is your first day, you will spend most of the day on your heel edge.  That means that you will slide down the hill facing forward, with your board sideways to the downhill direction you are traveling.  Lean back on your heels and slide down the hill this way until you get comfortable standing up on the board.      Yes, you are going to be very sore the next day...and not necessarily just from falling.  Snowboarding works muscles you don't even know you have...expect to feel some pain the next day...but it is all worth it.    You are going to want some goggles, waterproof pants, waterproof gloves, and a waterproof jacket...you can get fairly inexpensive versions of all this at any sporting goods store.  The boots and board can be rented from the resort...but you do need snowboarding boots to fit into the snowboards bindings.  The helmet is your choice...I never wore one, but it isn't a bad idea.    Most of all...have fun.  Snowboarding is one of the most kickass ways to spend a winter day.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Absolutely get a lesson, you will never learn the right techniques of snowboarding if you don't get a lesson, and the instructor can get you to where you need to be by the end of the lesson to start exploring some of the easier hills.    Chances are your legs are going to be sore, most everybody goes through this because snowboarding uniquely works muscles that ordinarily don't get worked, but after a few times of riding it will start to get better.      Definitely get a helmet and goggles.  The helmet can make the difference between a concussion and just getting right back up after a fall, and it does not take that much to hurt your head.  If I wasn't wearing a helmet this year, there were several occasions that I would have definitely had a concussion, but the helmet stopped it and I was able to get right back up.  As for the goggles, if the place you're going to is making snow or if its snowing or precipiating out and any part of your face is not covered up, its going to feel like thousands of needles being stuck into your skin, obviously not the most comfortable feeling.  I also recommend you get a mask to keep your face covered because it can hurt if you don't keep your self covered up and your getting pelted with snow crystals.     I would recommend this      http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/me...    I would rent the boots and board your first time only because you are probably going soon and you really need to do some looking around and trying on of boots to make sure you get the right ones.  Sometime in the next few weeks look into purchasing a board and getting boots.      As for the gloves I would recommend getting a good pair of mittens because mittens keep your hands warmer than gloves.      Also, you need good clothes, you want a jacket and snowpants with breathability and waterproofing ratings of at least 10 K each, if you already have a jacket and snowpants and they are a good brand, Nike, Under Armour, Burton, etc. you may be ok with what you already have but if you have stuff from walmart its cheap junk that won't keep you warm.      Also, don't be fooled into thinking the more socks you wear, the warmer you'll be.  If you wear more than 1 pair of socks you are just going to be cold, you want to wear just one pair of warm socks like these    http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/se...      Snowboarding is real hard to learn, chances are you're going to think about quitting after you start because its a lot of work, but do not quit.  Once you get good at it, its A LOT of fun.  Good luck and have fun|`|M0IRADgWaa	Lessons would be a very good idea. me and my big bro took lessons and it def. helped us to pick snowboarding up quicker. It also depends on your instructor. If you have done any other type of board sport it will help. you don't HAVE to get goggles but it wouldn't be a bad idea. and of course a helmet is safer. Get good gloves, especially for your first day. make sure you have plenty of layers. of course, as you get better you won't need as many layers unless it's really cold. and I'm not gonna lie, your gonna be pretty sore your first day. but don't give up on it, it is an AWESOME sport, my fav. by far.|`|lcHzbFpXaa	yes lessons are good get warm gloves, goggles help with powder they also help with keeping the wind out of your eyes i would rent the board and boots for the first time to see if you like it and yes you will probly hurt in the morning|`|AA10556284	I went snowboarding yesterday and now I am sooooooo sore.  I'm sore in places where I didn't even know I had muscles! Lessons would help greatly, just to know your basic skills like stopping and how to properly balance. Goggles reduce your visibility so it's up to you depending on the weather, helmets are a must is it's your first time!!!!!! and you can rent the boots at the rental place. For gloves, just wear warm waterproof ones and make sure you bring a change of clothes. Also, make sure your jacket is warm and snow won't go up it.|`|mTJJPtl9aa	YES. Get lessons. I've been snowboarding for seven years, and lessons helped me shave off so much time. Waveboarding may help, but snowboarding is a unique sport, it feels much different from surfing, skating etc. Don't buy anything, but you should rent helmet and goggles, and obviously a snowboard
AA12325046	Ultimate dream fight.  Marciano was probably the greatest conditioned fighter of all time.  He trained so hard and intentionally came in at 188 lbs so he would have better stamina than his opponent.  He could have easily fought at 200-205 lbs.  He had a terrrfic punch and an underrated defense too.  A lot of folks don't realize this fact.  Go to youtube and click on marciano underrated defense and you'll be surprised to see he was not a human punching bag.  Dempsey got hit much more often than Marciano did.  Both could take good shots and both had devastating power in either hand so this would be two tanks coming after each other at their very best.  Dempsey would rock the Rock a few times especially early on as it usually took Rocky a few rounds to really get going.  In the middle rounds the crowd would come to their feet as both men would stand in ring center trading hard punches.  Marciano would miss a few wild ones but would also land some hard shots.  Dempsey would start wearing down by the 9th round and go to the canvas from a hard Marciano right hand.  He would get to his feet and last the round.  In round 10 Marciano would trap the Manassa Mauler on the ropes and land vicious lefts and rights to the head and body.  Dempsey would fight back, but the Rock will not be denied as the referee intervenes and stops the fight with Marciano the winner by 10th round technical knockout.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	dempsey in ten he was to good you didnt say under what rules see dempsey was champ when you could stand over a fighter and when his gloves are off the floor and hit him again there was no neutral corner then and that is why he lost to tunney the rule was new so if you leave that out he would win in ten if you add it it would be  split decision for rocky dempsey would have to many points taken away|`|dh48AkbCaa	the fact that dempsey was beaten a few times leads me to believe that marciano had that much more endurance, which makes all the difference in this matchup of top 5 all time heavyweights,<br>  <br>  both fighters take a lot of good shots, but it's the rock who endures to stop the manassa mauler in 10 pulsating rounds.|`|xlyk63xRaa	weell marciano unfortunately fought in a time when there was not really anyone in the heavyweight division worth fighting, i think dempsey would take this before round 10<br>  marciano fought people way past there prime, cn u honestly say louis was at his peak when they fought or moore ?|`|Gj8JTJGRaa	Marciano ko 7th|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Marciano KO's Dempsey in 4-5 rounds|`|8Sw8rJgtaa	Going with Dempsey on this one.Dempsey had the edge in speed and defense with power being about even.Dempsey was only ko'd one time and that was a possible dive.Dempsey would have no problem landing big shots on Marciano,remember the best puncher he ever faced was a washed up Louis.Dempsey's combination of quickness,speed,power and savagery would make this a bloodbath,once Jack hurt him he would never let up.Marciano was great but he would be facing a guy who bobs and weaves and can take a punch.Dempsey by K.O. in the 9th. Btw those loses to Tunney happened after Dempsey sat on the title for 3 years,he was washed up and couldn't do it anymore and Tunney was a great fighter to his credit.|`|Gzk1TQFAaa	I saw the name Marciano and I just had to answer this question!  Believe it or not, Rocky Marciano was a close personal friend of mine.  He was also my neighbor and employer when I was a kid (I picked up rotten apples from his yard).  He paid extremely well and was one of the sweetest, kindest men I have ever known.<br>  <br>  Anyway, about this fantasy fight.  Marciano was an undefeated champion.  This was mainly because he could take a punch.  He could deliver one too, but they all could.  I have to agree with your outcome.  It would be Marciano's fight.  However, it might have been 14th or even 15th round.|`|vGXfXXFIaa	Marciano K.O. 9th round.
AQmcZ0gYaa	I agree, as long as you leave the T-wolves off your list of retraction!!!|`|I2I843Myaa	If they did, at least my Cavs could stay.|`|e0f460213964f7ee6ff6888355ce4cdaaa	I think in general, there are too many teams in all the major sports leagues. Because of this, there is watered down talent throughout the league. I'm not sure what teams would be contracted from the NBA, but you have to give OKC a chance, they just got a team and the city supports them. The NBA wants international teams, so Toronto will stay as well. The Clippers would probably be first to go, for obvious reasons, and then maybe smaller markets such as Minnesota, Sacramento or Golden State. But SAC seemed to be a great basketball town when things were going good. With the economy as it is, it is likely teams will decide themselves if they have to fold or move.    Monkey Dog...I sure hope so. But if LeBron leaves, you can expect the worse!|`|tY3rZSsiaa	wizards - missing arenas, a big key to their team. still underachieveing with butler and jamison.  okc - young team with a few guys who can really play ball.  theyll get better in a few years.  clippers - theyre pretty much missing their top 4 players.  kings - ok outside of martin and maybe miller, that team just isnt going anywhere  warriors - they have the talent and they just got monta back and crawford should be coming back soon.  blame the coaching staff, the skills are there.  pacers - ok outside of granger i agree with you here too  raptors - theyre a disappointment and outside of bosh i would agree with you here too.  bobcats - ok i agree with you here too, you can take wallace off that list though maybe.    some of these teams have talent, theyre just not well put together.  if htye wanted to make it real competetive, then they might as well just get 8 teams and spread all the star players around.|`|mff1vstNaa	Eliminating teams would shorten the season and the league will lose many fans. More decent players would be out of jobs like Arenas, Butler, Jamison, Davis, Ellis, Martin, Granger, Bosh, Calderon, O'Neal, Wallace, Okafor, and the list goes on.     I have a problem with retracting in Charlotte and OKC. They've only been around for a short time. Of course they are terrible since they haven't created a solid foundation yet.    Apparently you haven't been watching the NBA for long because Washington has had a decent team up to now. They've been around since the 60s.     obviously there needs to be bad teams in the league and if you keep eliminating the bad ones, then the league will just be down to a few teams.    edit: some of those stars will lose their jobs because the other teams won't be able to pay for them. And those scrubs that do lose their jobs also lose their chance of becoming great. And many of those guys play big roles for their teams.

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Racing may not be that big right in the Twin Cities but it is very popular just south of you (Lakeville and maybe Proctor?) and in western Wisconsin.  The track outside of New Richmond, Cedar Lake Speedway, is always packed and even attracts a few of the NASCAR drivers annually.  There is also Red Cedar Speedway in Menominee.  Both of those places would be within radio range of the Twin Cities and attract a decent audience.  You'd be surprised to find out how many racing fans are in the Twin Cities as well, they just aren't all that visible or vocal at times.  It must be that Minnesota nice or something, they are just more low key in general.  Racing is bigger here in Wisconsin and if you ever get down in the Madison area they always have the races broadcast on the radio.  Good luck!  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	Country music stations are your best bet because of demographics and statistics.      There are tons of FREE radio stations online that carry nascar races.  I guess you have to have high speed internet to use them, maybe same as for trackpass, not sure.    My local radio station has all of the cup races online FREE.      Sometimes stations aren't able to get the Brickyard 500, because Indy Speedway has some different company doing broadcasts.  Here is my local station, you can click on the listen live link to the right on their page.  http://www.961thewolf.com/info/nascar.sh...    I would go ahead and try to listen to them and get everything (programs needed) ready to listen.    Also, PRN and MRN have good websites.  You can find stations that cover them and look for ones that are broadcasting online for free.  PRN http://www.goprn.com/affiliates/stations...  MRN http://www.racingone.com/mrn_home.aspx|`|aRy2ZvT9aa	You really should invest in sirius Satellite radio, you not only get the races but the Nascar channel  128 is on all the time, I'd go nuts without it, turn it on theres great talk shows on there, Nascar News, and MRN carries all the Nascar races. Or you might need a better antenna for your radio, I have a friend in Northern Calif, theres no radio stations up there that carries Nascar races, but there is one down here in southern calif that's gonna carry them, they invested a great FM antenna, now they can hear the station. Or you can get Trackpass from Nascar and listen to MRN on your computer.    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|EHtFxGxMaa	You're probably not going to have much luck getting a station to broadcast NASCAR.

AA10297143	There is nothing to love about the Super Bowl.  It is the anticlimax of two teams that didn't play well enough to be there overall, however, any team can beat any other team on any given Sunday, and that is all that matters.  They won at the end when it matters.  Now they get to "entertain" you.  Don't be surprised if the Budweiser commercials are more entertaining then the game.  Even bigger surprise, the Boss at half time might "Steel" the show.|`|DRPhJnXzaa	Yes I do love the Superbowl , it would have been better if it was an all Pennsylvania Bowl , just my two cents .|`|4kdlE54Paa	I look forward to the SB every year.  It isn't just about the game.  It is the only day of the year that a group of my friends all come together and hang out.  It is rare when we all get together and this is our day.

It just so happens that Pittsburgh is our team and the whole city is in a frenzy.|`|cxMsOspSaa	Ya, but your looking pretty sexy, so.....|`|0fc4be2c7fe0b3251308b8c4479f2d3baa	I love the superbowl...|`|wbIEau0qaa	yes, its the best unofficial holiday of the year|`|7dPm35LYaa	I love the superbowl .Even though my team (The Patriots) aren't in it I still watch it cause it's my favorite sport to watch. It's bittersweet though cause football will be over, now I'll have only basketball to watch.|`|4blCVEvOaa	Yes I love watching the Super Bowl. I love watching almost any football game.|`|cqpctVWbaa	I personally could care less who's in it. But I seem to watch it every year.     When I was in college I saw the differences in quality between the NCAAF and NFL and I just fell away from even caring about the NFL anymore.  College is so much better to watch (at least in my opinion).  I've still got my teams that I've always liked (Green Bay and Steelers), but I don't watch any games during the season, and the outcome doesn't phase me depending on who wins or loses. To me it's more about the competition between friends that you watch it with.  You always have someone rooting for either side, so it gets interesting.  In all actuality, it's probably my second favorite game to watch.  Second only to the Ohio State vs Michigan game every November.|`|wkDlHA4Baa	I agree it is the best unofficial holiday. I don't no wut i would do if  i couldn't watch it!|`|CPZA5qrGaa	I look forward to the Super Bowl each year.  Makes no difference who is playing.  I was saddened by the Eagles loss.  I was hoping to see the Steelers and the Eagles play   against each other in the Super Bowl.  I still would have picked the Steelers over the Eagles.  I'm a die hard Steeler fan even when they don't make  it to the play offs.  I love the Steelers win or lose.|`|zN0orpp3aa	The Super Bowl is an unofficial holiday.

jSkHquK5aa	LASSANA Diara will take the number 6 shirt in domestic competitions. He will, therefore, wear the name "Lass" on the back of his shirt to avoid comparison with Mamadou Diarra.

He was assigned with the number 39 for the UEFA Champions League|`|hoPc2PO3aa	i guess because 6 was the other Diarra ..

VDKVy4A3aa	Yes he can . When he was back in jersey, he was a great jump shooter around the foul line distance, and even the 3 pointers. Jefferson was one of the top all time scorers of the Nets .

LIKkt8djaa	The US has no mountains that are able to stay open year round for snowboarding, You're best bet for the longest season however is Colorado they on average only have around 2 months that they can't snowboard, or I believe the first indoor snowboarding place to open is gonna be in new jersey.. but that's not a mountain and it will be all man made snow/ice :P|`|nRYVWkpEaa	** Not Vermont, I don't think any place in the U.S. is year round, but don't quote me, I could be wrong, that's just as far as I know...    Sorry, I know you're not getting the best answers, but you could try Whistler.   They're open till,   late June I believe, and the glaciers tend to stay open till late July if I'm not mistaken.   Plus, they have their summer snowboard camp, where you could possibly get a job.  As for colleges I have no idea, sorry.    But over in Europe I think they actually have some year round resorts.

WrDGhduxaa	When you run fast your foot should contact the ground only slightly in front of your center of gravity, coming rearward at the speed you are moving forward, in a pawing motion.  If you are landing flat footed you are probably contacting the ground too far in front of  your body, this causes you to brake the forward progress until your center of gravity passes over the foot.  when you are running fast you should naturally contact the ground only with the balls of your feet, this what people refer to when they say run on your toes. You do not run on your toes but on the balls of your feet.   Practice the movement during drills, either walking or standing while holding onto a fence or other object, then progress to marching then running.  Once you get the feel it will become natural.  Many people think a longer stride is the key to running faster, it is not. Speed is the combination of stride length and frequency. If your stride is too long you are running slower not faster.   Running is a pushing motion not a pulling motion, you increase your stride behind you not in front.|`|CI5qOBcDaa	Yes. all of the power from your running comes from pushing off on the balls of you feet. i went from a 8.7 to an 8.4 in the 55 just from changing my form. and in hurdles i went from a 10.5 to a 10.1 from that.     there's no way to get used to it, you just have to keep trying it every time you run....my coach make me walk like it all day...and eventually you will do it without even thinking.     hope that helps =]|`|Yj47LMavaa	i run on the balls of my feet, but i just ran like that all my life, and couldn't help it, but now i can run however, plus i'm REALLY fast, i'm even qualified to be in track and such. i've beaten people on sports teams that run all day every day, though i'm on no sports. try to learn to run on the balls of you feet, but be careful, it will most likely hurt the first few times you try it. the best way to train yourself is to try to kinda tip-toe around your house, then turn that into a short sprint, gradually increasing in speed as you get better. but if that doesn't work for you, try to force yourself to just run awkwardly on the balls of your feet. walking on the balls of your feet doesn't seem to make any difference, so just give that up, but just try to run on the balls of your feet.|`|XFwY5M5eaa	Yes! if you purchase a nice pair of track spikes and run on the balls of your feet (without your heels touching the ground) you will see a significant difference in your times!
MDhI4mBEaa	Yes, it would be like the old Single Wing Formation, except that formation still had the Center snap the ball, but the Center was lined up were the Guard or Tackle would be.  So it would be T, C, G, T, G with TE on each side of the line.    Yea, The TE's would be eligible, but I think a down lineman or a TE has to line up on each side of the Center. If the Center has no players to one side of him on the Line of Scrimmage, its an illegal formation because technicaly the Center would be eligible reciever, thus he can't snap the ball. Either a T, G or a TE has to be on each side of the center.|`|PG1LuEk5aa	no...have to have atleast two down lineman on either side
xhPKkkELaa	Kids, accompanied by their parents (who are willing to be responsible for liability and payment), can rent a board at any age at just about any shop in the US. On your own, most places will want you to be at least 16, and others at least 18. They all require a substantial cash deposit or a credit card, and almost all want a driver's license as proof of ID (and some hold your license as additional security for the transaction).|`|AA11573840	Depends where you are. Usually because of liabilities you have to be 18 in US. Some places that are just set up on the beach might not be so strict, but stores where you can rent usually require credit card or deposit. In Mexico it is real easy although I never had to rent there. In England I believe I was 16 or 17 but had to put a pretty good size deposit down.

I have the same problem with one leg being longer than the other, except mine isn't as bad. Your best bet is to get orthotics, i know their expensive but its really the only thing that will help. I went to Health Works and got custom orthotics for $200 but they will last for 3-5 years.

oMjVp4zGaa	you will have no problem trolling in fact I would like to recommend a few patterns and techniques to use.  In close to shore use shad raps, fat raps and as you are paralleling shore you are watching your fish finder so an 8 foot diving bait never goes into four feet of water. I would troll the beaches in three four five feet of water and by holding my rod tip higher keep the bait from digging into the bottom. Then tie on a deeper diving baits, turn the boat around and move out further from shore and let the line out further and cover four depths going back and forth. I also love the Bomber Long deep diving A's. I caught thousands of fish doing this. I also would speed up the trolling speed going one direction and slow it going the other. I never went without getting my rod almost pulled out of my hand and I trolled with a 75HP Merc.|`|cLm5FqWnaa	planar boards|`|p5CrZ5Bwaa	Well it depends on if your hand trolling or not and what kind of fish you have there.... Im from Alaska and I have Humpy, Coho, King, Sockeye, Dog those are the salmon we have and we have Halibut to but still|`|to8Vpp0zaa	What size motor do you have on your new boat?  Will it idle down slow enough to troll?  If not, would your 10 hp fit on the transom?  Or you could get a "trolling plate" to attach to your main motor.  A speed indicator is nice.  You might want to consider a GPS or a fish finder with GPS, if you haven't already.  Install an ample number of rod holders....I have 8 on my 17'.  For planer boards, I like the in-line ones, but you might consider a mast and ski set up.  Down riggers would pretty much wrap it up.

8bTder08aa	It might be difficult to find sources that relate specifically to racetracks, because nobody was really keeping track of attendance demographics at that time, but there are a few generalities that I think you can apply.    In the 1800's and earlier, travel would have restricted racetrack attendance to locals.  Railway service prior to the 1850's was in its infancy and transport by horse-drawn vehicle to race meets would have been for the well-off only.      Until at least the post-World War I era, the attendance of women at racetracks was usually very limited.  Outside of the enclosures and clubhouses where aristocratic patrons were separated from the greater masses, it was not considered socially acceptable for women to go to the races.  Within the areas where the aristocracy viewed the races, there were areas where women would not be admitted, such as bar areas and areas where wagering was taking place.      You certainly wouldn't have seen children at the races in the 1800's.  In a British race meet of the 1800's you also wouldn't have seen much racial diversity, either.    I wish I could give you more help;  if you google a few sites to find photographs of race crowds prior to 1900, you can "eyeball" the crowd and make some judgements about the people.  You can also look at factors like the transport and economic situations, as well as the social status of women and minorities and what restrictions were placed on their attendance and activities to draw some conclusions.    Good luck.

jR8kyp0Taa	Well, the MAIN draw at Wimbledon consists of 128 slots.    There are also qualifying rounds, but I don't really count that as Wimbledon.    The ATP website shows the complete "South African Airways ATP Rankings" and currently shows 1,932 people who are currently on the list. If you play any kind of ATP tournament, whether it be a grand slam or a Futures tournament, or anything smaller that is still considered professional, then you are on the list.      1567 to  1932 all have 2 points in the standings. Nadal, at  1, currently has 13,160 points.    so I guess you can take 128/1932 and that gives you 6.6% of professional tennis players make the Main Draw at Wimbledon.    On the women's side, there are 1,108 players ranked professionally. 128/1108 is 11.5% of professional women tennis players will make the main draw.    Hope that answers your question.    Boy Wonder    EDIT: Also, 19 different men and 16 different women have won Wimbledon since 1968 - and 1968 was a dividing year from years before it, because in 1968 they started to give out prize money, and also professionals were allowed to compete in that year, and before 1968 only amateurs were allowed to compete in it.    19 men and 16 women have won Wimbledon in the 51 years it has been played professionally, out of the thousands and thousands who have ever made the main draw. That is a very small group.|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	that is the funniest question i have ever heard!haha  the players get in by their ranks, not by odds...

You have to be at least within   100 in the world ranking minimum, and a few pro. players receive wild cards by invitations only. and then there will be the qualifying tournaments to insure at about 8-10 spots to enter prior to the Wimbledon or any other Slams. There will be 128 players participate in for men. Women as well as men, 128 players. Now do the  Math as to how many eligible tennis players are in the world against 128 ? for men or for women. :)?:}|`|8CZiBaxgaa	that has to be one of the stupidest things ive ever heard  wimbledon consists of 'tennis players'  its not a competition where anyone can join, only tennis players.  so the answer is 100% for both|`|gMZKdml9aa	That would be a very slim percentage if you are comparing the number of individual players who have played at Wimbledon to the total number of people who play tennis...

Rfk88kMTaa	Alright its great that you have the ambition to want to go varsity. I was a freshman last year, out of 5 trying out, and i managed to get on varsity, and i was the only freshman to get to be on the team. Its great that you have ball control, but it means nothing if you do not undertsand when to use them. One must choose wisely on shot selection, so i sujjest playing alot of tennis and seeing what works and what doesn't. To speed up your serve, work on your legs. Legs make the power on your serve, workout the legs, but do no neglect the upperbody as well, for it does have impact. You also need to rotate your hips. That in itself will aid you to a fast, more powerful serve. Now for the kick serve, it is an awkward serve to hit, for that just leep practicing, work on your core for that serve, as reaching behing your head and exploding upward requires a strong core.    Good luck on making the team.|`|2ab86b1d07a4387eb50e37a6fe895233aa	well umm  my school doesn't allow freshmans to be on varsity  im in 8th grade now but i practice with varsity when i get a chance  umm ur style reminds me of caroline wozniacki and agnieska radwanska  i cant tell u exactly cuz i dnt want u too take my advice and blame me  well i suggest u to luk at some of aggie's and caroline's youtube videos they can be very helpful  it depends if u are a offensive or defensive player  well lest start by offense well if u dnt hav power than u hav to use ur angles real well  i mean hitting balls closely to the lines or mix it up with hitting approaching shot to net or drop shots or slices or heavy topspin or sometimes even lobs  sometimes the big power hitters just want that topspin ball but they hav trouble with slices..it wont be as hard if they hit after u give them a slice giving u a opportunity to end the point  if u are a defensive player and not hav power then u mus be fast and hav lots of stamina but again if they put u on the run then slice it or u hav to make amzing passing shots  im an offensive baseliner who overpowers my opponent and im 14   most of the time my franns slice it to get thereselves bac into the point|`|CnNAOoWgaa	Wow, sounds like you're very focused and motivated about this.  Well, being the former number one on my highschool varsity team, the key to success is practice and technique.  In the next two months you need to work on your consistency and power as well as your fitness and footwork.  Find other players and practice with them daily, preferably people better than you.  Hire a tennis coach and ask him to critique your skills.  Do wind sprints and pliometric drills to improve your explosiveness and movement.  No good tennis player has ever been slow.  Buy tennis books or look up tutorials on the web to help improve your technique.  Make small improvements every single day in your technique and fitness over the next two months and hopefully that will be good enough.    BTW, on my team, we played round robin matches to determine who made it.  Winners stayed, losers out.  One rule of thumb:  Never ever give your opponent free points.  Unforced errors are not allowed!  Make him work hard for every single point and chances are you'll come out on top.  Being more focused and harder working than your opponent is half the key to winning.|`|cRPUjIMSaa	well 1st of all u ccant have a light easy to get serve yoou need to have serve improvment thats 1 of the most inportant things in tennis likly sorry to say you may not make it unless you outshine all of the kids older then you a lot of coachhes go by the grade cause they think there better|`|oXMT7Uqyaa	well it all depends haow long and how seriously u have been playing. if u arent verry serious and u have only been playing for a little bit, then u cant rele learn much. for instance, i have been playing for 10 years (5 years competitavely in junior tournaments. im a top ranked junior in 16s)it took me about a year to learn my kick serve, another to improve my footwork, and then yet another to build up my power game. i suggest working on ur footwork and building up a stronger serve are ur numer 1 priority. try going to a tennis pro a few times a week and get tennis channel(they have a great program call 'tennis channel academy'). watch a feew episodes and look on the internet for some footwork drills.

fUDlbOP0aa	well, I only own and shoot one gauge, 20. its ok. makes my shoulder really hurt. but its not my limit.     I have something with even more recoil than that. Mosin Nagant 91/30 with Bulgarian YT/ heavy ball. the recoil calculator says its 20.1 lbs recoil energy, the upper limit for most people. Its certainly the limit for me! Then I got a recoil absorbing pad and the recoil dropped somewhat. but its still makes the 20 gauge feel like the SKS and the SKS feel like a .22 rimfire.    My first shot with the MN 91/30 made me fall over backwards. I was expecting a lot of recoil, but I obviously underestimated it. It was like a cannon.

h7GtCCC7aa	Celtics best/cheapest way of staying in front in Scotland = penny pinch the other sides players in SPL.    Hearts got close to them a few years ago.... steal Hartley and Pressley, the backbone of the Jambos.    Dundee Utd doing well this year, taking Robson wasn't enough.... lets have the goalkeeper, maybe Flood plus another one or two in the summer.    Hibs got a wee bit dangerous too, Rangers started to strip their squad, Celtic finished them off taking Caldwell, Killen and Brown (who, credit for once, they paid decent money for)|`|AMTIwdQ2aa	The minute he signs the moronic minority of celtic fans will feel he is worth at least 3 million|`|nH4TOhGVaa	no i did not expect him coz i think we desperately need a defender|`|8kpvTUQaaa	You mean like Paul Hartley, Donati, Graveson, Balde, Crosas, Naylor, Caldwell and several other  Parkhead "superstars"?|`|wK7mSXDraa	he will be worth the same as that other superstar paddy mccourt1|`|lKdLsRPDaa	Honestly...I was not expecting us to buy anybody. I think 100,000 is a very good price for Flood, he is a good player and will be a welcome addition to the squad, just like Barry Robson was last season.     Why do you persist in these constant Celtic themed topics, with an always sarcastic tone. I really can't relate to 90% of what you write about Celtic or their fans, because I don't think I come out with nearly any of what you say, that we have supposed to have said or intimated.     I go on about us being financially sound, not loaded.   I've never intimated that a player who plays well against Celtic automatically increases their value.  I think Brown is a very good player, with some rough edges, but if he keeps improving the way he is, he will be an excellent midfielder. It's not hard to be the best player in Scotland, but he is definitely up there. Don't really know why you see so little in Brown, apart from the fact you support Rangers!  Can't say I'm over the moon about Flood, but as I said I'm happy with the signing. Would like more signings (Left back, Centre Back and Striker), but again not really that fussed or upset that we've not signed anybody, I'd rather we bide our time and get the right players at the right prices, than rash buying, to appease the fans.     So as I say, can't really understand your sarcasm and digs, what I've mentioned, all seems like very honest and objective assumptions of things Celtic and a million miles away from what you come out with!?|`|mHnNibApaa	millions of what???  whats the currency in lord of the rings??|`|23533728e2015c47fbaedd308257bf8aaa	Ill tell you after the game.....haud oan.....|`|BdiQPKn0aa	Wait until he's had a couple of good games with Celtic then all the top teams all over the world will be putting bids worth mega millions in for him|`|S0LSmJ9haa	nobody ever said playing against Celtic increased a players value..that must be how you feel  100,000 is a good price for flood, nobody will say he is the 2nd best player in europe..your imagination yet again  I don't have to imagine the ridicule from fans as your lot have been ridiculing us since the rumour started  Actually Billy..most of us were not expecting any signings..we would rather not spend millions then have to get rid of them a few months later to balance the books..  if that is what we can afford then so be it..the team we have are not doing too badly so a couple of cheap fresh faces are good enough for me
fmAyYHyoaa	I am preety sure the host nation gets in automaticly. So they should be playing in the world cup|`|bNw9QeILaa	i agree, south africa isnt taking part in the world cupp ....my opinion,|`|xwsS0ITJaa	If they don't get to play you will see this lot of boons go crazy and burn the place down.|`|58HL86ATaa	manchester united are world champions now so no need for anymore tournaments.|`|zJCWIWE0aa	For sure, the host is always in it, just like germany last time and korea the time before.

However for the whole 2008 and now into 2009, Vickie Guerrero. Yes i said it. Vickie Guerrero has been and still is one of the greatest heel managers the WWE has ever seen. She gets the most heel heat then really anyone on Smackdown. Randy Orton basically just started getting major heel heat. Orton will probably be best heel in 2009, hands down.|`|2cH8JeVNaa	1. Orton  2. Edge  3. Jericho|`|f4de45631130f3426bea2b772f72ba55aa	Of course he is one of the best heels.

fEWhwumZaa	Federer vs Nadal      It's a shame it worked out like it did, I would have preferred Verdasco vs Nadal in the final.|`|YmV3TNTpaa	It's always special to follow a Federer V Nadal but I'd love to watch a 100% power Nadal V Roddick|`|6S8KjBLQaa	Nadal vs A-rod baby..hopefully Verdasco vs A-rod though...for his sake.|`|M0gdrhB2aa	anything with Nadal or Verdasco|`|75ZMWlnnaa	my preferences:  1. rafa vs fed [i will NEVER forget the wimbledon 2008 final, i dont think i can even if i tried to forget it, it was just too good. hopefully they meet on sunday night, going to be good for the tournament too, expect record crowds if it does happen]    2. rafa vs roddick [roddick has beaten rafa on HC before, and rafa has beaten roddick on HC before, so will be an interesting match-up, but i think it will be rafa winning anyways due to better movement, but full props to roddick, he does look much more fit than before].|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Andy Roddick definately...don't really care who the other player is.|`|91b7280fd9803a425ab46749a96ff39aaa	I'd go with the classic Nadal vs Federer match however Nadal vs Roddick could be very interesting too...  I definitely want to see Nadal in the finals...|`|VefSnu0Gaa	i'd love to see andy in the final.-  no matter who he faces, but i guess that if it's verdasco on th eother side things might be a little simpler for him, so i'll go with andy-verdasco.-  :)|`|uuHrf7cGaa	It is for sure a Spaniard will be in the Men Finals of Aus open this year. Every one wants to see Nadal Vs Federer, but I am for Nadal Vs Andy as well. Andy is moving well and playing great Tennis, but lately Federer has issues with hard hitting and serving opponents. But he came back well against Potro...So Andy needs to play the best of his life or it will be Fedex in 3 sets.    But again - I am putting my monies on Nadal - even if gets hotter.|`|akUibcJWaa	FEDERER VS NADAL|`|a31kUn1Naa	The Federer vs. Nadal match is pretty tempting. Would love to see this.    But also, Roddick vs anyone.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	That's a no-brainer...another Rafa x Fed classic, of course! (With the Spaniard emerging victorious!)|`|i0C58qbbaa	I WOULD LIKE FEDERER VS VERDASCO - IAM GETTING TIRED OF HEARING HOW GREAT NADAL IS HE IS A GOOD PLAYER BUT I DONT THINK HE IS GREAT ALSO I FEEL HAS HAD AN EASIER DRAW THEN ROGER, OR NOVAK OR ANDY MURRAY     HE HAS HAD LUCK THROWN HIS WAY ESPECAILLY ON THE DRAW SIDE|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Federa and the upcoming Ver person.|`|EhbyJnV9aa	Wow i would love to see another rafa and federer final but it would be cool for a verdasco and rodick one cause there both underdogs but i really want rafa to win!!!!!!!!|`|cISlJr8xaa	Just another federer vs nadal   Classic

Good quistion it's funny|`|21J0IIZbaa	I would not vote for Davis.
9hC7bbf7aa	Hey James, the world does not hate her. It may well be the opposite or she hates herself. Did you notice how mad she becomes mainly towards her when she makes faulty shots ? It has to do with her expectations are more than she can meet or handle ? A perfectionist's dilemma ? No past Karma, I don't think so...whatever.  She is a wonderful player, and I believed she was going to dismiss Serena from the way she was playing...alas ! she fell to the ground again. No you haven't offended me at all, for I embrace my fellow tennis fan's honest opinions. Another word or two..Bud Collins was never a pro, tennis player...easy said than done ? Besides Svetlana is only ? 23 years old, and has many more years to prove her talent on court..  I know how poorly I play, let alone on the world level ?extremely tough, and I respect our players, although they throw temper tantrums...upsetting for them. As long as they don't throw 20 rackets per match on the ground, at chair umpires or toward spectators ? Ha ha. Easy James, don't raise your Blood Pressure.|`|agHUvyAtaa	First of all that question is so disrespectful on so many different levels.  That is not only disrespectful to Russians but to everyone who died in WW2 and all the survivors. Hitler is not someone to joke about. He is an evil cruel man and god forbid no one will ever come to the world again with the same mind as Hitler.|`|wTWSVNdDaa	because of the mustache?|`|VWGWH2Z1aa	I don't really understand your question. It strikes me as being rather stupid but I know comparning Fidel Castro to Hitler makes you are very sick person.|`|uuHrf7cGaa	Nothing to do with dictators include Bush, Blair to that list as well(if you have to)....I care less with all the names mentioned. They are all politicians and they do anything to gain power. They may have the karma and that's why they go to hell. So be it.....    Related to Kuzy - frankly speaking she choked herself. She could not put away a simple volley in the 3rd set. That alone spoke of volumes. She was concerned of her opponent and pushing herself than how she was playing. Simply put - the mind games choked her game. Definitely she is a much better player than what she showed in the 3rd set. Actually she started falling apart when she was serving in the 2nd set 5-3 to win the match.     The world does not hate her - She will be hating herself for the loss. She always finds a way to lose to William sisters. Mentally she was not strong and that dragged her into while she was serving for the match. In addition, Serena as usual put some pressure playing few good returns and shots and Kuzy busted like a balloon.
1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Yes; it's fun and an excellent way to get outside in the winter and play in the snow.|`|to5BW9Apaa	yes. what a workout.|`|AA11441385	Think of it as hiking on skis.  If you like hiking in the woods you will love XC skiing.  Although XC skiing is faster once you get a bit of technique with more thrills (and spills).    Another advantage is that, after a few hours on XC skis your balance and weighting will be so much better when you go back to alpine skis.  The free heel on XC skis does not let you cheat the way you can with alpine skis.

I just came on here to answer your question because your email isn't open.

HIfs0vgzaa	I'd pick Travis Outlaw. Here's why?<br>  <br>  1. He scores more efficiently. <br>  <br>  2. Plays better defense.<br>  <br>  3. Provides length. <br>  <br>  4. Great in clutch situations. <br>  <br>  5. More experienced.|`|WkpOrF64aa	Travis Outlaw is a better scorer.  He is just a plain better shooter, than Ariza.  That may change, soon, though, since Ariza has increased his range to the 3-point line.<br>  <br>  Ariza is a better defender, though.  Plus, because of his athleticism, he can guard like 3 different positions.<br>  <br>  Plus, Ariza has always seemed like he has more DRIVE than Travis Outlaw.  Not to mention the fact that Outlaw has had injury problems, before.<br>  <br>  So, personally, I'd go with Ariza.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Trevor Ariza|`|9iB1AiQlaa	Ariza has more upside. I would pick Trevor.|`|AA11091071	It depends on the team.. if the second unit has a few good defenders, then you will need firepower off the bench, or vice versa.<br>  <br>  However, i see Outlaw is more talented but Ariza is more consistent at this stage of their careers.|`|1Mscji6Saa	ariza no question|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Outlaw,he's a better scorer and is a better shooter.And he's a good 3 point shooter too has good defsen and i pick him|`|fc5a2676d0a9ea687d91d44050637158aa	Ariza..<br>  <br>  there are about the same. I like his defense and his 3 point shooting
2wAPwZ1kaa	Ortiz is the best left handed bat in baseball, the only concern there is if his ailing wrist keeps him out of the lineup. Youk is your money man, he got a big contract extension and deservingly so. Lowell is probably gone, he's too prone to injury, old, and just had hip surgery.|`|3cd675f8a0783955763670d5ea211808aa	Lowell is past his prime. Youkilis is a very good defensive player wherever he plays. I'm sure if he played the outfield more often, he'd be very good at that too. He came up as a third baseman, so he will probably take over for Lowell at third within a year or two. As for Anderson, he is rising rapidly through the minors, and probably reaches Boston at the end of this season, and comes up to stay sometime next year.     Ortiz is fading.  Why do you think the Red Sox were willing to pay Texeira $170 million? They really needed him. The wrist gave Ortiz problems last season, but he wasn't having a great year before that. He got off to a terrible start, got hot, then slumped again. First, he's probably older than his stated age of 33, second wrist injuries are slow to heal. Third, his body is probably beat up from years of steroid abuse. Not that you read about that in the Mitchell "Report", which was written by a lifelong Red Sox fan.|`|PkCqIfMFaa	There is a lot of scenarios that arise from this matter. For one though, unless Lars is way too good for the minors, which he still isn't and has plenty of development ahead of him, he will not be coming up to replace one of these players due to injury. They have other options, which is one reason they re-signed Mark Kotsay. They want to make sure Lars develops and is not rushed. 2010 he still may not be ready, but you still don't know. As a die hard Red Sox fan, I hope he is because he has the potential to be an incredible power bat with power, but unlikely at this point in time. To early to tell to be quite honest. I think they are expecting one of the guys to become old and beaten down (Ortiz or Lowell). So yes, it is possible for one of them to be traded when Lars is ready. Youk will not be going to the outfield no matter what the circumstances are unless Ortiz and Lowell become incredibly healthy over the next 2 seasons. But even if they do, I think they will keep Youk in the infield. The only possible situation that Lars will be traded is with a package deal for a proven superstar. I mean superstar, not a good player, but someone of Hanley Ramirez's caliber.|`|EzNKaKR0aa	Lowell is getting worse. They need to get rid of him. Youkillis should be the first baseman, he can get into more All-Star games. Don't get rid of him, he's up-and-coming. Ortiz, why would they get rid of Big Papi? But when they have Youkillis at 3rd base, let Ortiz play a little 1st.|`|rRlTtoylaa	Ortiz has lost a set.  Clearly on the down side of his career.  I don't see him long term.  A year or two at the most.  Youkillis is okay.  Nothing great.  As long as he continues to put up his "normal" numbers he could be around two or three more seasons.  Lowell is overrated.  Mr. Attitude!  He's a legend in his own mind.  I don't see him around more that this season only.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	The definitely should trade away Lowell. He is only getting older and only getting worse. You might as well keep the young guys like Youkillis and Anderson, because they haven't even hit their prime yet. Also for David Ortiz...WHY would want to trade him!? Every time he comes up to bat you have a chance of seeing a homerun!|`|jKOB7n35aa	Lowell would probably be the first one to go in 2010, probably at the trade deadline since that is when his contract expires. Ortiz is too good a hitter to let go, even if his contract expires that year too, and Youkilis just signed a 4 year extension, and he isn't really an outfielder. I would think Youk would be switched to 3rd since that was what they were going to do if they signed Teixeira.
r5AMG8g7aa	My feeling is that it will only cause more low quality schools to be out there. After all I simply can't believe that there are enough fully qualified instructors out there to man the number of MMA type schools that are out there now. This is likely to cause even more unqualified wannabees to be out there.  Those of us that have been around for a long time have seen the fads come with each new martial art or sport. Each time it happens the market gets flooded with many inferior instructors. This is no different. If anything, it may be harder to set the standards of quality for what is and what is not a qualified instructor.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	What a joke...the next McDojo fad will be "fitness based" MMA classes held in the next evolution of Gold's Gym? I think the USA needs more realistic approaches to solving our problems than to add another rip off scam Gym like these.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Well it does not really bug me. I do not think one will be opening anywhere with in five hours of where I live. They are probably only going to open them in big cities and such.    Now if one where to open here I actually think it would be good for my coach. All of the grapplers that were able to teach him moved so his ground game has become a week point. I have no intention of ever making it big so I do not think it concerns me one way or the other|`|1oNi2v38aa	It looks like it will appeal to those who have money to train MMA in a UFC facility and people who want to "train UFC" (lol). But I don't know, we'll see how it goes.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	I'm not an owner but from the sounds of it, these will just be another chain of gyms. Sure they offer some MMA training but I doubt it will be any better than what you can find out there right now.    It might pull away those that are only in martial arts because of the UFC but that isn't a huge loss in my opinion.    I would find it interesting if they use these gyms as recruiting depots. This could lead to a massive expansion of the UFC as they acquire new fighters. Time will tell, but remember, everyone thought the XFL would be the best thing since sliced bread.|`|RQRGQgk3aa	These gyms are specifically NOT for training MMA fighters. They are fitness gyms that model their workouts on MMA style training. They are not a threat to any MMA fight gyms, but might be considered competition to Balleys or Golds Gym.|`|vToaRondaa	what to you expect from a greedy aerobics instructor (white) with no real martial arts experience.  I'm glad they are doing this in a failing economy where established businesses are going under.|`|Yslq4OYhaa	This is a pretty bold move considering the economy of this country right now. This doesn't concern me at all. I don't think it will last long, bu who am I. I said the same thing about the internet....lol    This gym is not about martial arts it is about fitness. I can see it make an initial profit because of the popularity of MMA. But like many gyms they don't last. The larger chain last, but many of the other don't. I have had memberships in 2 different gyms. Neither of them are in business today.    I wish them the best.|`|f6a5f17703370369bc87d81dc079a04aaa	I would not be to concerned, any impact they have will be short lived. Just anther fad.

VU6ODC5Baa	I think you are  thinking of Vince Mcmahon,because Paul London wasn't in a a limozine accident.|`|u8GHTJEEaa	As Vince was walking out to his limo (just before the explosion) on the June 11, 2007 episode of Monday Night RAW, Paul London could clearly be seen smiling (like an idiot, as some have described it) when Vince passed by.

360c66240ece2cffefc507bfa04c3addaa	There were a number of "over weight" cheerleaders on my high school's JV squad. Tell her to go for it and if she doesn't make it then "oh well," she tried.

Say something good about Rocky Marciano and watch them crawl out of the woodwork to put him down.|`|I1w0HfQbaa	First of all, why do you write as though you left the caps lock on? It friggin' irritating and is difficult to read what you are saying. If Cammarelle was an Olympic gold medalist in the 2008 Olympics then there will be a lot of high profile trainers and promoters who want to do business with him for a variety of reasons. First, he is an Olympic gold medalist which means in the world of professional boxing one thing: money and lots of it. Second, the heavyweight division is weak, laughably weak, so if he is as good as you say he is then he should be able to unify the alphabet soup titles and beat both Klitschko brothers. He could very well be champion within four years if he plays his cards right.     However, just because a boxer wins Olympic gold does not necessarily translate to success in the pros. Tyrell Biggs was an Olympic gold medalist and was brutally KO'd in seven by Tyson. That fight effectively ended Biggs' stay at the heavyweight class. After that fight, he was reduced to a glorified trial horse. Howard Davis Jr. earned the distinction of being the only boxer from the '76 Olympic team to have never won a title even after three tries to win a belt. So being a gold medalist is hardly a lock of success to championship glory in the professional ranks.|`|zI6cZoAWaa	you are lucky to meet roberto, i love that guy. he has great power, strength, height. he should turn pro now there is nothing left for him in amateurs. i want him to get revenge on povetkin|`|sOi98doYaa	Are you for real???

NdTy3twjaa	For one he had mono which really puts your body on a strain and makes you extremely weak..  He also was and is getting older plus the players around him have closed the gap (i.e. Nadal, Djokovic and Murray ).    But you must remember, he set such a high level that last year was awful for him. I mean he made the Aussie Open Semi's, the French and Wimbledon finals and won the U.S. Open, most players would kill for that type of year.|`|VefSnu0Gaa	he had mono.-|`|6of3tqHhaa	He had mononuclueosis which caused him to get really weak during the season.|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	There were several factors. First off he caught mono and was ill, second he showed he was human and the pressure of maintaining his expectations and level of play probably got to him a little... he slid back a bit while Raffa Nadal improved a bit.  They are really No. 1&2 in the world and there is a noticeable gap between them and the rest of the top 10. Federer only showed he was human. At 22 years of age Nadal is not in his prime... Roger may be slightly leaving his... even having said that, I would still expect Federer to win at least one slam in each of the next 3-4 years. Look for him to reduce his tournament schedule and to focus his energies for the majors.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Enough with the mono...yes, he was sick in the beginning of the year and it affected him THEN, but from the second semester on it was no excuse. C'mon, people, even Fed himself said so in countless interviews...not that we'll ever know because it's none of our business really, but it seemed to me like he had a really bad year on a personal level and that affected not his *mad tennis skillz*, but his motivation to win. I blame that witch Mirka LOL|`|MaXRMg35aa	He had mono which hangs onto you for ages, so I think he did very well to do what he did!|`|gP7IB2XCaa	roger had mono...but he still played and tried his best. i think he will get his rank back because rafa has so much to defend later in the year.  i hope he does well in the australian open too :)
4kdlE54Paa	I understand how you feel, but I don't think I have it in me to give up the sport completely.  Not for one complete ******.    If your concerned, how about me?  There are rumored predictions that Michael Vick will be signed by the 49ers because of the developing coaching staff of the Niners that has had previous ties to Vick.  I have faith that Singletary is disciplined enought, as well as the 49er franchise, that they will not sign that PR nightmare.    My opinion is that the Commish needs to set an example to all NFL players by expelling him from the league all together.  Maybe these players will take it seriously like other professional sports and realize they are not above the law.  These players need to set a better example to their fan base.    Thumbs up to those who agree.    Edit:  To those who are using Pacman Jones as a reason why Michael Vick deserves a 2nd chance, 2 wrongs don't make a right.  Someone needs to be the example to stop the BS.  Might as well be Vick and anyone else to follow.    LOL!  For those who are giving me the thumbs down, you are only telling me that your personal entertainment is more important than morale values.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	nothing nfl sucks.|`|jlk4HF6Xaa	People are all like It was just dogs and bla bla bla. Like shut up! Ugh. What he did was soo cruel and he definatly should not be allowed back in the NFL and should have gotten a longer sentence.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	haha    back when he used to be on the falcons, sure he might not have been the greatest pure QB but he was one of the most exciting players to watch for his ability to make plays with his legs    and especially with the wildcat stuff getting real big now if vick is around as fast and agile as he used to be he would be perfect for that stuff    a lot of people in football have had problems with the law, vick honestly wether u like it or not is one of the few that has done time for what he has done    oh well we will see if/when it happens      (dawgmeat  has a good point)|`|lPDHMOVZaa	I'd be fine with it and actually hope he gets back in. Vick would be of great help to a number of teams.     Vick killed a tortured dogs... which is a pretty horrible thing to do... but he served his time and paid his dues... it's not like he is a convicted serial killer?     Would you care if he sponsored cock fights?|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	wouldnt'c are|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Well, I wouldn't watch the NFL as much...I'd still watch the Patriots...    There is a difference between violating the substance abuse policy and killing or even killing animals...People who don't get it are stupid...    Besides, I don't think he will be reinstated anyway...He lied directly to Roger Goodell...Oh, btw, Goodell will decide if he gets reinstated...    Translation-not happening|`|MbcvI1A9aa	i wouldn't mind it, i think what he did was very wrong, but he was in prison for 2 years. hes probably been through a lot in there. i believe every 1 deserves a 2nd chance no matter how bad they were before.|`|UGAr0M3laa	id be suprised since he was such a criminal|`|19TIPpaBaa	Michael Vick would not be reinstated. I also don"t think any NFL football team would want Vick on their team as they might lose some of there fan base!|`|6fGv1TS0aa	What about the other criminals who've never been caught and are still playing in the NFL?  Besides, doesn't the Raiders like criminals?|`|1HOQyvsIaa	hahaha I would watch him get destroyed by any defense in the league.|`|AA11065140	I completely agree that his behavior has been beyond unacceptable.  However, as with any criminal, you have to allow him to move forward with his life, once he has served his time.  We cannot punish him forever, after all.    If the NFL does reinstate him, I will hope that the Raiders pick him up, 'cause they could use someone with his arm and ability to move on the field.  Additionally, his attitude and criminal history would be a great match with the rest of the team.    Edit:  I can't disagree with you that his prison sentence was not commensurate with his crimes.  That said, you need to move on.  The law says he has paid his dues, and that's the only thing that matters at this point (except, of course, the NFL and their rules on behavior off the field).|`|4blCVEvOaa	He's a moron, there's no doubt. But after he's "paid his debt to society" he should be free to resume his life. If that means trying to continue his football career....so be it. I just wouldn't want him on my favorite team.|`|nqdDe3cJaa	what would i do ?????? ummmm .... probably the same thing i would do if they dont reinstate him.      i do have a question for the questioner however ...... you would never watch the NFL again if they reinstate Vick ?  so im assuming youre watching it up to this point.  youve got no issues with Leonard Little getting drunk and KILLING a HUMAN BEING ????? nice values you have there.  making dogs fight is out, but getting drunk and ramming your car into another car killing another HUMAN BEING is A-OK ??????    do the world a favor .... dont reproduce.|`|OdovbvSYaa	i wouldnt do anything, nothing you can do.  he should be strung up imo, but its not up to me is it.    hes not that good anyway, cant even throw straight, who the hell would want him?|`|SEcM9EDZaa	I thinks it's more a matter of "when" than "if" Vick will be reinstated. Once he's done his time and if he prove to Goodell he's changed his ways, he will get another chance. The league has given Pokeman Jones numerous chances, so you can count on Vick getting another one.  That said, the team that signs him will face a PR nightmare for signing him. Not because of his criminal history but because he simply isn't a championship-caliber QB.|`|TbO83l3yaa	he could be the broncos runningback. i wouldnt mind that!!!|`|RrKeyYo0aa	ok, yeah you're right, the dogfighting thing was cruel. but adam jones caused a man to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of his life, and he got reinstated. which is worse? ******* with a mans life and lively hood or a dogs life? the whole mike vick thing just spiraled out of control, jamal lewis sold drugs (and that to me is worse than vick) and did his time, what happened reinstated, ray lewis... a shooting involving a human life...what happened? slap on the wrist and reinstatement. and oh lord don't get me started on adam jones. in the end mike vick is just as good as those players i mentioned, if not better, so he should be allowed back into the league. his main opponent will be PETA, but like i said, he's just to good of a player to not come back.   and BTW it's really sad that the NFL even allows these criminals to go back to "work" after they do these dumb *** things. because all of you know if you or i had done half the bad things that these NFL guys have done, we would be standing in the unemployment line the minute we got released from prison or finished our last AA, anger management, or domestic violence class.|`|nkibqHpSaa	A man committed murder at the same time mike vick was dogfighting and served less time so in my mind he has served more than enough time. Tons of players have done things I think worse than dog fighting and get to play in the nfl again. Mike Vick is one guy I would love to see play football again.|`|yLAH35rhaa	i really wouldn't care. And he probably would sign on to a team like Detroit and compete for a starting job. He really wasn't that bad as a QB. His O-line and wr's sucked, but he was pretty successful statistically.|`|6lQDbyHuaa	Cowboys are going to get Vick my freind told me and I looked it up.   I think he dosn't deserve to be out|`|KdhNCnEjaa	I love watching Vick. He may be a terrible person but he is the most entertaining player in the NFL.|`|fHxpycJSaa	Then don't watch. He's paying his debt to society, that's all you can ask of someone. I'm not a Vick fan or supporter, but everyone deserves a second chance if they pay up. He's doing it.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Pray hard that he doesn't join my Colts. Then write an angry letter to Roger Goodell. Honestly what could we do though that would do any good? I'm all for second chances in life, but not second chances for earning millions of dollars. He should join the real world and work for his money so then maybe he would learn to spend it wisely rather than on bets on dogs lives.    Edit: I agree completely with Kendall. He should get another chance as a man. But not as a football player. He was exciting to watch, don't get me wrong, but that's not a good reason for him to be welcomed back. That's horrible ethically and logically.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Nothing. He deserves a second chance.|`|a6EndAPiaa	If they reinstated Michael Vick without suspending him I would be upset.  He should be punished by the NFL but I am sorry a lifetime ban is just too much.  You can test positive for drug use three times and then you just have to sit out one year and you are banned with a 4th positive test.  If you give drug users 4 chances you have to give Vick at least one more chance.  What about the convicted wife beaters?  They were not banned either.    I am an animal lover (I have a kitty cat sitting in my lap as I type this).  What Mike Vick did was despicable but he will have paid his debt to society and been punished by the NFL.  If the drug users and other felons are allowed to play Mike Vick should be allowed to play as well.    In all honesty I would be much more upset if the NFL issued him a lifetime ban than if they let him play again.  It is hypocritical to the nth degree to let people like Pacman Jones and Ricky Williams play and then to ban Vick.
afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	Those guns are hit and miss. Basically it's just an extended vent rib barreled version of the HP model. I've seen some that fired fine for years, but the majority jammed quite often.   You'd really be better off looking at something for a few dollars more with a better reputation as a target model.

5BEyeVy7aa	If you are talking about the incident at the gun club a few months ago:  the boy was shooting a full auto uzi and the continous uncontrolled recoild caused the barrel to rise and he shot himself in the head.  In this specific tragedy I place blame on the "safety" that was observing.|`|2IdpvI2Vaa	You're correct that recoil moves the gun backwards while the bullet goes out the business end of the barrel. With some guns, the faster you shoot the more the barrel starts rising upwards with the repetitive recoil. The stock stays low since you're holding it but the barrel starts rising.     In the case of the little boy: he was allowed to shoot a full automatic Uzi and the barrel rose rapidly with the sustained recoil. It rose so much that a bullet went into his head. The father was supposedly busy playing with his camera and the range officer wasn't close by and watching closely either to try and help intervene when the boy started loosing control of the recoiling gun.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	You should have posted a link to the story. I suppose if it was a semi-auto, and he let the barrel swing back toward his head, and his finger squeezed the trigger...|`|dfBwVxXFaa	if it was a semi-auto, and the recoil was enough to bring the pistol back that far, and his finger was on the trigger, it could be possible. Youtube has some videos that show a situation that could be bad.  Look up "Girl gets Owned by Desert Eagle"  Its pretty funny, and it will probably answer your question.|`|AA12274507	There are very few details in the statement. But it is possible he could have caught a ricochet if he was shooting close. Look up 50 cal ricochet on YouTube. Strange things can happen when shooting little pieces of metal at supersonic speeds.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Very few news reports about so-called accidental shooting actually give the real facts because the people asking the questions and writing the story don't know jack about guns and how they work.     What may have happened is that the gun recoiled and he fired it again.|`|5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Let's look at some simple physics here. Newtons Laws of Motion also apply. Specifically, Newton said that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. In the absence of gravity, say floating in space, if I light off a rocket engine, exhaust goes one way and the rocket goes the other, action with an equal and opposite reaction. The moving rocket is the "recoil" from the force applied by the exhaust gas as the rocket burns the fuel. In the case of a gun, the powder burns rapidly, increasing the pressure in the chamber in ALL directions. I think you can see that any pressure applied to the barrel is exactly opposed by pressure applied to the opposite side of the barrel and equal forces in opposite directions contained the barrel cancel each other out. The bullet, however, can move and as it moves in the direction to leave the barrel, force is applied top the end of the chamber, pushing the whole rest of the gun in the direction opposite to the path the bullet takes. The bullet acts like the rocket exhaust in my space rocket example. Since the center of mass of the gun is not in line with the force applied, the gun tends to rotate about the center of mass. In order to shoot yourself, the gun would have to rotate very fast so that by the time the bullet leaves the end of the barrel and it starts a straight flight, it was pointed at YOU. The question really is this: do you think it possible a gun can rotate that fast, that by the time the bullet left the end of the barrel it was pointing in your direction, 180 degrees opposite to the starting position? In my opinion, it is NOT possible to shoot yourself based purely on the force which we call recoil. Without restraint, the gun will rotate with the barrel rising and you will miss the target on the high side. The longer the barrel, the higher you will miss because the force has more time to act on the gun to rotate about the center of mass. Remember, once the bullet leaves the barrel, the pressure exerting the backwards force goes to zero and whatever direction the barrel is IN when the bullet leaves is the direction the bullet will continue to go in a straight line. Newton's Laws apply to the bullet as well in that when a body is in motion, it tends to stay in motion unless acted upon by an outside force. Once the bullet leaves the barrel, the pressure applying force to the bullet goes to zero, leaving only momentum to carry the bullet in motion. In the absence of air friction and gravity, in theory, the bullet would travel in a straight line forever. Is it possible the boy could be injured by the recoil of the weapon? YES. Just ask anyone who has used a shotgun and gone bird hunting with a 12 gauge. MANY have had bruised shoulders from not having the butt firmly seated against the body. The kick of a 12 gauge is fierce, and worse if it builds up some speed before it hits back into your shoulder. In my opinion, injury from recoil is possible, but shooting yourself from recoil is NOT. Just look at the physics and Newton's laws of motion. There IS a possibililty, a situation in which you MIGHT shoot yourself, but it takes many bullets instead of the situation I analyzed with a single shot. With many bullets, from a fully automatic weapon, a machine gun which repeatedly fires as long as it has bullets and the trigger is depressed, the gun tends to rotate with each pulse. Bullets come out and the end of the barrel rises with each shot until the barrel IS pointed back toward you and the next bullet to leave comes in your direction, but it has to be relatively unrestrained to allow the gun to rotate 180 degrees. I saw a murder mystery a while back. One of the characters suspended a machine gun from a rope in a horizontal plane and then remotely, pulled the trigger. The recoil caused the gun to spin, spraying bullets in a circle, killing many in the circle before it ran out of bullets and he pulled the gun back up to the roof. The mystery was how so many were killed with no evidence anyone was standing in the middle of the crowd yet all the shell casings were there which seemed to indicate someone WAS standing there. Shoot yourself? Maybe, IF the gun is unrestrained AND full automatic AND enough bullets to have at least one left to fire in your direction.|`|itiLu3dRaa	Yes, in Mass-a-two-shits, 8-yr old kid was killed when he was allowed to fire a full-auto mini uzi.

RVD is the longest reigning ECW Television Champion though.    As for the answer to question, the winner would be whoever was booked to win the match by the company that it was in. Personally I believe Extreme Rules suits RVD better than it does Punk, but it depends whether we're talking about RVD in his prime or his current role where he is a very rare part time wrestler. Both are very good wrestlers, but Rob Van Dam has a high-flying extreme style, and CM Punk has a technical, submission style with a little high flying. Both have various kicking offence as well. So RVD is more suited to the match, but it would be up to the booker.

I seesee both Ovechkin and Crosby retiring around the ages of 38-40.     AO gives it his all 110% of the time. His team could be winning 10-0 and yet he'd still be out there playing like it was his first shift. Its something truly special about him. He also runs at guys like a mad man. I'm dreading the day he ends up hitting someone and hurting himself because if he keeps his pace of hitting up it'll happen one day.     I do think AO will last longer than Sid. Sid is only in his 4th season and last year he had the horrible high ankle sprain and this season he's been dealing with a nagging injury. Missed the ASG because of it, and I believe it's affected his play in recent days/weeks.     I don't want to ever think about the end of AO's career, so I won't put too much thought into it. I'll just take him game by game, day by day, and week by week......when the time finally comes for him to hang up the skates...whether the reason be because he's tires himself out early in his late thirties (which I'm fearing) or he plays til he's 46 and follows in the steps of Chelios.......he'll be a player to remember on the ice and off.|`|hiGDg0R0aa	his career isnt ending any time soon!! hes amazing!|`|0yNFwwpeaa	He is good for another 15 years.|`|0Umym3h9aa	Well he seems to be very durable even considering the type of game he plays. 10 years ago it would have been easy for NHL fans to predict that Ovechkin would not have made it past 600 games. But these days players are so well trained and in shape that Ovechkin is probably going to last for well over 1300 games. That is unless a horrible injury takes him out of the game. Hopefully he doesn't become a Forsberg or a Bure. I wish Ovechkin the best and hope he can break some records!|`|Uathep5Yaa	I say he plays out his contract and that is it, your right injuries are going to happen but along as he is in demand why not keep playing and well collecting that check.    Remember Lindros his 1st half dozen years or so he was an absolute mad man but injuries caught up he call it quits after 12 years and in his last 3 he didn't even crack 50 games.|`|v3dTJIrcaa	Not more then ten more years. Unless he slows it down.|`|upcdHHxdaa	Well, he's 23 and the Capitals signed him for 13 years! I think he'll hold to the contract, too. As he said :"I signed a long-team deal (because) I want to be here. I like Washington. Right now, I can't believe it."    So its pretty clear HE wants to make his career last as long as possible. His opponents might have other ideas though.

Another issue that makes it even moer difficult is that there are free Y/A accounts and then there are Y/A that you pay for. Most people are likely to have the free email account.

c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	They way I got into handguns was by target practicing.  They are just a lot more fun to me to shoot than a rifle.  That means finding friend would go with you to shoot.      Just FYI, it is ok for you to own a handgun, you just cannot buy it from a dealer.  It is perfectly legal for your dad to buy a handgun and give it to you.  (Or you give him the money and he buys it and gives it to you.)  You'd still have to use him to buy ammo, but it wouldn't be too hard.    As to Obama.  I know he is anti-gun, but I don't think he is going to do anything crazy his first term.  He does want to get re-elected.  That means you have four years.  And even if he does, it just means that the magazines will just be that much more expensive.      I'd order a lower receiver for and AR right now as opposed to a pistol, if it were me.    10 Point, nothing wrong with an 18 year old wanted to take on more responsibility.  I don't see responsible gun ownership being a bad thing to starting this early, even handguns.|`|AA12034449	You wont change his mind...folks have opinions.    There are sheep, sheepdogs and wolves.

Explain to him that crime happens in suburbia all the time. Nobody ever expects a robbery.

He was an avid hunter but had absolutely no use for handguns in general.    With the money that I earned at my summer jobs, I saved-up enough to buy a handgun.  Of course, he had to do the paperwork.  Somehow I convinced him that all I wanted to do was to own ONE handgun.  Of course, down the road I ended-up buying more (with him again doing the paperwork).    Here's the deal.  I know that when you are 18 years old, 3 years seems like a lifetime.  Trust me...and others that are older, those 3 years will go by quickly.  If nothing else, just save your money, have a special fund for it, and spend the next 3 years researching exactly what you want to buy and the fair price for such a handgun.  On your birthday, you can walk into a gunshop and buy your own handgun.|`|xcG5Tasiaa	You're 18, you are an adult. I'm guessing you are healthy.     Why can't you work and earn the money to buy something?     If I had kids, I wouldn't buy them something that expensive, anyway.     You only have to wait until 21 to buy from an FFL holder. In most states (you didn't list yours) you can buy at 18.     Get a job! :-D|`|5OscbYafaa	Convince him its for sporting purposes not self preservation.   Tell him you have found a new found interest in precision shooting.  Then take him to your local shooting range to share your hobby with him.   If this does not work, its time to move out of your parents house.  I assume you are old enough to move out if your are legally allowed to own a hand gun.|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Well, do you shoot your 10/22 with your dad? Making your shooting activities with your current gun to include him may get his interest more.     Position it as "father and son bonding days". After a few trips shooting targets and cans and such with the rifle, start to say "It would be cool if we had a Ruger Mark III pistol to shoot too, so we could work on our pistol skills". Order a Ruger catalog and show him how nice the Mark pistols are. Drop a lot of hints.....|`|AA12274507	You need to start sifting through the local papers and or police logs, and looking for burglaries, home invasions and other types of violent crime. Sometimes people get complacent and think that it can never happen to them. What got me started on stockpiling was two home invasions that happened a few streets over from where I live. I live in the middle of nowhere. But all the druggies come here from the cities looking to steal things cause they know the police presence is not very high and everything is so spread out there are very few people to notice anything going on at a particular house. Crime can happen to anyone at anytime and anywhere.       It is your choice(in this case your dad's choice) weather or not you want to be a victim or not.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Well, here is the best part...  If you live in a free state and not a obamanation state then you can go purchase a handgun on your own so long as it is a private party sale. The Federal law states that you must be 18 to purchase a handgun and FFL Dealers are not allowed to sale a handgun to anybody under 21.    Find yourself a private party sale and go get one.|`|d24f7a30bc118870baac73f6e65257d6aa	I'll side with Dad on this one.  As far as personal protection goes for an 18 year old who is not enlisted in service, I see no reason why one is needed.  Your at a time right now that will shape the rest of your life, don't complicate it with another responsibility.  If you want to one day own a pistol for personal protection, start out with a target pistol now.  Convince you father to buy you a nice Ruger Mk3 or some other nice .22 target model.  This will give you time to get comfortable with a pistol and you'll get to shoot more.  .22 ammo is about the cheapest you'll find, this means more rounds down range and more experience under your belt.|`|S1aCKA8vaa	remind him that the most violent and terrible crimes occur in places that no one thinks about. nobody plans on getting robbed or mugged or raped or many other things no one thinks that they will die in a car wreck when they get behind the wheel point is expect the unexpected. better to have one and never need it. than need one and not have it|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Maybe he doesn't want to buy one because your mom will shoot him with it for not mowing the lawn or having sex with the mail lady or whatever. First off, you can't really convince anyone to buy a gun, they need to want one on their own. You can tell him that nice neighborhoods have also been the targets of home invasions cause of all the nice stuff you all have. And don't worry about the gun bans, if you buy it now, you're on paper. And once the bans are in effect, they are just gonna send Blackwater over to everyone's house and collect them all. (well I don't know that but I can pretend to be a paranoid nutjob too right?)
CI5qOBcDaa	well it will help improve your time, but prob only to a max of an 9 minute run. if you really want results, then sprint the next 200. or i would try breaking them by 100s if you were going to sprint, it makes it easier. and when you go to run it, pick someone to run with at tryouts who is around the same spot as you and push yourself.    good luck =]|`|kQNBvN5Faa	if you are trying to do distance than don't do sprints alot. if you want to get the mile faster then you have to practice the mile or 2 or what ever you want. like i said earlier it helps to run on the treadmill. that was you can choose you speed.

AA11694178	The best thing you can do to improve your shooting, in addition to practice, is upper body strength.  Work on building your upper body strength and you will find that you are much more able to hold your rifle or handgun steady when firing.  This will do little about any flinching or trigger jerking problem that you may have developed.  If you are fortunate enough to have never developed either of these habits or have been able to overcome them, you are very fortunate.  As for foods, any foods high in sugar or caffine will cause your hands to shake.  Marksmen who shoot in competetion will usually avoid foods high in sugar or caffine prior to a match for this reason.|`|4mb6xaxBaa	stay away from caffeine and sugars

(THATS UN BELIEVABLE). ppl say kobe&james bcuz there the flashiest and most exciting but when you say best player i think of the player who impacts the game the most DIRK. he dragged role players to the finals in the western conference and no other star did that. (lebron did in a weaker eastern conference) dirk is an impossible person to guard. he can get past any bigmen with his quickness or take that bigmen out on the perimeter and use his guard skills to score. and if a smaller person is on him he will post him up. (KOBE IS A PERIMETER PLAYER WHO NEEDS A SHAQ OR A PAU OR AN INSIDE PRESENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PLAYOFFS, DUNCAN IS A POST PLAYER WHO NEEDS A GINOBLI OR A PARKER TO HELP HIM HAVE PLAYOFF SUCCESS.

cb7d8d8e1066301d27e5cac9944cfbfcaa	This is a very interesting question ! I will try to answer it from my point of view (fly fishing).    1) You learn the ropes, by that I mean how to cast, proper knots,   and learn the hatches in your area,  learning a bit of entomology does not hurt, either.    2) You practice your craft, becoming more accurate and more more selective. You start to fish by intuition, and then you just "know"   what to tie on.    3) The physical limits of the human body....... If you learn to fly fish when you are young, and practice the craft for a few years, I'd say you'd be in your prime in your early twenties. How long you stay in your prime physically  is directly proportional to how well you stay in shape.     Logging long hours crisscrossing a swift river and working a 2 mile stretch used to take me less time than it does now. But......I still catch as many fish, because even though I may have slowed down   (just abit) physically, I put the knowledge I've accrued over time to better use.    So, in a nutshell, even though you may slow down physically, if you  stay sharp mentally, you could be in your prime for a very long time.    Tight Lines|`|NkMXnQopaa	There is no "prime", you get better and learn more the more often you fish. It's not like the NFL or NHL, where being 40+ is considered to be "old".    My grandfather would take me to Lake Erie and taught me how to catch some monster walleye and crappie.|`|AA11372901	I think that if your still physically able to do the work involved in fishing then you'll never hit you prime. You should always be learning.|`|RFQTnf3yaa	The beauty about fishing is that anyone from any walk of life can enjoy fishing.    When you are young there is excitement of catching something and the excitement of exploring.  When you are a young adult, you have freedom and a way to escape the stresses.  When you have a family, you can introduce your missus and your children to fishing and see the excitement on their faces.  When you are older, you enjoy being outdoors and take in and appreciate the scenery.    Basically, there is no prime.  I might be in my young adult life but i've enjoyed fishing for many reasons for many many years.  And there is nothing to stop me enjoying it in the future.    All the best!|`|eXHc54p6aa	anytime really it doesnt matter!|`|O9FojdEMaa	depends when they started. you can't buy experience.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	in there prime! ok clear now ? good. next|`|RxTIzsyhaa	Don't really think there be a' prime age, heck my Grandson is 9 years and has a' 10 1/2 pound Largemouth Bass to his credits :) :)!! I've been fishin' for 50 years PLUS and the biggest I ever managed was a SIX POUNDER. Think I mind him out fishin' Grandpa ~ H _ _ L no, I love it ;) ;)...  |`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I think fisherman are always improving and learning more, as long as they are able to physically get out there and fish your prime is always shifting.  When your reflexes and senses start going you could be considered past your prime but that wouldn't occur for most people until they were into their 70s or 80s.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	you could say that you get better every time you go just because you learn new things every time and technology gets better, so I would say that the last few years you fish are your prime
KJWxqQHiaa	Good question. Trout and Bass are just the fish you're grandfather fished for when he was a youngin'. Trout are more of a "rich-man" fishing, because many people have $400 Orvis fly-rods, hand-tied flies, etc. But, you don't need that fancy crap to fish for trout. (Which, it would help!) Trout are probably the first fish you caught with that ole' rooster tail or mepps or panther martin that your pop's bought for you. It's moments like that, that you can't forget.  Wow, getting carried away with the fishing w/ gramps thing! Bass are just a fish that's known for fighting, is easily accessible (virtually every lake, stream or pond has bass.) are caught on loads of different tackle, and just engrosses millions of bucks a year. Spinnerbaits, buzzbaits, chatterbaits, crankbaits, suspending baits, top-water poppers, plastic worms, just to name a few. Trout & bass are just fun fish to fish for, that's why they are dubbed as "Old Fashioned" fishing.|`|NkMXnQopaa	Bass are such aggressive and voracious eaters which seems to be a turn on for anglers. Also, they are common fish found almost anyway. Trout, I guess because they are stocked throughout the year in many local streams. Around where I live, opening day of trout season in the Spring basically signifies the beginning of fishing season I guess you could say.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I guess I didn't know that they were but I would say they are 2 of the most targeted fresh water fish in North America.  Trout have more of a loyal fan base but are not near as wide spread as bass.  They are both a blast to catch but a native brook trout is about the prettiest and best tasting fish I have ever caught.  I would also put brookies up, pound for pound, against any bass including smallmouth.

Here's a choice of Abu Garcia spinning reels, check them out for yourself http://www.abu-garcia.com/cat.php?k=1325...|`|0audneJ4aa	Abu Garcia does make some very nice reels but I would stick to a bait caster reel rather than a spinning reel for hauling in big fish. It really sucks when you are trying to haul in a monster and the bail keeps flipping open.    EDIT: Sorry I just saw your edit and in that case please ignore my advice. :)|`|bkhvdfJxaa	i use diawa...its only 35 dollars....never liked abu garcia reels....use diawa for 10-35lb stripers and 5-15lbs cats with out a problem...even took out a 102lb bat ray....but any brand has a few selections of good ones and bad ones...so its up to your budget and your preferable choice....|`|d09432d5f16b0b606f445596be973266aa	Probably look into Abu Garcia, they are a well known brand.|`|N4t2t3dMaa	honestly its not the reel its the line and the way you fight the fish, i have caught carp well over 15lbs on a zebco 33 and 404 and 202.
CI5qOBcDaa	well keep the distance the same until you are able to jog the whole 1.3 miles or so, then you can extend the distance. how long will it take, 2 weeks is generally the time used to describe how long it will take to get back in descent shape, but it could easily be longer or shorter to run that distance. then add on to it. it depends on personal achievement.     i would do this at least 4 times a week to begin with and add more days as you schedule allows just make sure you do a max of 6 days a week to allow for rest.    good luck.|`|fo2E0NOLaa	First off, congrats on quitting on smoking and starting to run!    To answer your question, keep running the same distance until your are comfortable with and slowly build up the mileage every week or two so you don't get injured and so that you can enjoy running.

yS5f1XLFaa	you should eat a lot of carbs and drink about 2ish cups of water  2 hrs b4 u swim. during practice drink a sports drink w/ carbs to help u get through practice. i swim 6 times a week and i get tired too. swimming isnt about swimming without getting tired, its about swimming through the pain and tiredness. you have to be willing to work hard and embrace the pain if u wanna b really good.|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	In addition to the other answers, have your stroke evaluated by your coach or trainer. By improving your efficiency you will decrease fatigue.    Good luck!|`|lHK13vqwaa	Well you should try and   1)get 7-9 hours of sleep a night  2)avoid junk food and empty fooods that just give u bad calories and no nutrition  3) lean meats(chicken, turkey rather than beef)  4) whole grains    Just eat balanced meals, lots of water and maybe have a gatorade with you at practice.     As a highschool swimmer myself i find it is important that you eat a good lucnh when at school and don't get the crap they try and serve you, it won't hold you and you'll feel sick.    Talk to your coach about improving your staminia.|`|cWfTvJTcaa	Talk to a coach or trainer about whether or not your workout is designed to increase stamina. Try a variety of workouts and strokes, although freestyle is where you build you stamina. Don't do all distance or all sprints. Definitely don't just swim continuous laps until you get tired. You need to break up your workout into sets. Use a pace clock to repeat your sets on a time.    Also, keep in mind that if you are doing a swim workout and not getting tired, then you aren't working hard enough. Have you noticed that your times have improved and you are capable of more in practice, even though you may still be as tired after practice as in previous years? If so, then you have improved. If everyone else finds it easy, then they aren't getting a good workout.    Monitor your nutrition, get enough sleep, and also try weight training to build muscle and running to build stamina. If you have a coach, talk to him or her about a diet plan (not to lose weight, to make sure you are getting the right nutrients), whether you should take vitamins, and a recommended regimen of running and weight lifting. If you do not have a coach, try a personal trainer at your local gym. Since you are only 15 and still growing, you should run whatever plan you come up with by your doctor.
pfm0wcEIaa	How do the crackheads that jump you on the street do it?<br>  <br>  Hm...Is that what they do? 20 JUDO classes?  Lol<br>  <br>  This all depends on your weight, height and how angry you happen to be that day.  It also depends on the quality of your Judo classes.<br>  <br>  I guess it is better to have had the classes than not to have them.  But the best way to prevent getting jumped is to avoid situations or places where you are likely to get jumped.|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Indeed and like the person above me said more then you could relize.<br>  The more you leanr the more your body adapts.|`|6mVpfmR6aa	I think it would, if you learn the various pressure points that can cause extreme pain and shatter limbs.  Although, I never really took judo.|`|5bzJUmh4aa	Assuming the person you are fighting doesn't know any judo at all, I think you would learn enough in 20 lessons to be able to apply some of the basic skills in a real fight.  At the very least you would be used to being grabbed and thrown, so your physical and mental toughness would be enhanced.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	The first lessons in Judo are how to fall and how to escape your opponent. Using Judo as self defense is a last resort measure.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	More than not knowing it at all. But you would probably still get beaten down if you have been in the past.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	This is a completely hypothetical question since no one can give you an answer it will depend on what and how you are attacked if you can defend yourself after 20 classes. Just so you know Judo was designed as combative sport and not as a method of self defense but if one were to train in a striking art and Judo then they would be better off and more well rounded to defend themselves. Good luck.|`|0YkLvjgcaa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  That said, your first lessons will deal with break falls (and maybe grips).<br>  <br>  Break falls teach you how to land on the ground after being thrown while minimizing the damage taken. - this does translate pretty well to street fighting, as you will be less likely to take damage if you're thrown, etc.<br>  <br>  You won't be a street-fighting stud, but it will help. Keep training and you'll be just fine.|`|vi1bbvCXaa	would you lose your weight for life if you run for 20mins? certainly a lil bit but for your life time, can you guaranteed you will master the skills? 20 lessons i bet u only learn white belts' skills, world are evolving and you will never know if the people who attacks you know martial arts. maybe he's been to 22 lessons. maybe he knows yellow belts' skills or black belts skills. if u choose to take martial art, there is no reason that you would want to quit unless you are just learning it for fun.|`|wFyBLstQaa	no martial arts will really help you inless you do it for years.

x6OsAvQeaa	Toskala. Hes helped the Leafs when necessary in the past. Hes more experienced that Pogge, whos just a rookie I hear. Pogges big at 6'3 and 204 pounds, but hes still got many years to go before anyone might call him better than Toskala. Pogges numbers look like this 1-1-0 record, allowing 8 goals on 42 shots for a 4.00 GAA and .810 save pct. Not all that great, but the Leafs defence is awful, only Kaberle is worth mentionning here. Toskala is in his 7th NHL season and his first season of 10+ games played was phenomenal: 2002-03 Sharks he had a 4-3-1 record, 2.35 GAA and .927 save pct. The next season he was even better. Yes its true that the Sharks were a good team back in 02-03 but still, Toskala was and still is very good. Hes never had any season with a save pct of under .900. Right now hes got an .885 save pct but the season is a long way from over. Look for Toskala to be better down the stretch with the Leafs fighting for a playoff spot. And Pogge getting little or no ice time at all. Its also worth noting that Toskala had a .904 save pct last year with the Leafs, a team with again an awful defence. Not bad for a guy under siege every night.|`|3sRVdOVnaa	toskola|`|8uqpB7Gzaa	toskala is way better, not saying pogge is bad, he will get better with more experience but right now toskala is better.

Take a look at Pogges numbers in the AHL  (hes near the bottom in GAA and Save %).    The leafs are counting on this guy as the future???

GhJtkZIKaa	Vicki as gm isn't the issue right now in the WWE. She gets a lot of heat; she does her job good. Any heel that can get as much heat and booing as Vicki is able to is a good heel.

psdgdidtaa	First, you misspelled mysterio. That would be a great match though. it would go on for at least 45 minutes. but i think cena would cheat to win    Second: Randy Orton should win so that stupid smile can be wiped away from swaggers face.    Third: Amazing match this would be. It would go back and forth until a tombstone from taker and hbk would kick out and super kick him.    Fourth: I disagree. Shelton should win. he was amazing in all the MITB matches before. I would like to see dolph ziggler win but that's just my opinion    Fifth: Awful match. edge is a douche and needs to leave wwe. i cant stand the man and the match would suck just because he was in it.|`|a1c79820b82a16475aa4c959f6efd44eaa	Xena and Rey--could be good: Totally agree ray being the winner.

Yes edge should win.|`|X9COVKyzaa	First mysterio vs cena would be a great match. Lots of back and fourth action. I say cena FU  Next we all hate ecw.

And right whentaker is on the ropes sweet chin music countered to a flip on the table.TAKER  jeff would just fight withe matt the whole night and forget about the match. I say kizarny  HHH|`|Pne371ESaa	alright this sucks horribly.     No way Rey is going to fight Cena at WM, and no way Rey would win if they did have this match.    This is even more of a long shot, why in the HELL would Orton waste the rumble win on going after the ECW title that has no prestige and is totally worthless.    NO way Taker loses at WM, although i want to see this match, Taker wins    why matt when you should have Shelton win because he is the most underrated wrestler like EVER. plus why are Regal and Kizarny in this?    HHH has to win this to get rid of that fat peice of Sh*t vickie.|`|DPcIjHHZaa	I'm a huge fan of Rey but him facing Cena is not likely.  Orton would rather compete for WWe or World Heavyweight title instead of Ecw.  Hbk vs Taker good match  mintb seem ok  main event seems good exept for hhh would win

And every martial art is the best as what it does, whether its just for fitness, self defence, sport, or show casing. So just choose one that your most interested in.    As already said by the person above, you question is rather vauge, what are you actually looking for within a martial art? If it's to "Beat People Up" then dont even bother trying, it defies the whole point of martial arts.     Martial Arts aren't about learning a "Super Cool Fighting System...." It's about learning to use your head in situations and not your broad. Any..Any proffesional martial artist worth his salt knows that, and will resort to Violence as a last resort.    Make sure you do it for the right reasons, otherwise you'll just loose interest and burn out.

Personally, Fillipino Martial Arts are my favourite.  They're extremely practical when taught correctly.  A true all round martial art, it teaches a variety of weapons for combat, not dance, and unarmed fighting in all ranges - kicking, punching, close, clinch and grappling.  Unlike virtually any other martial art available at the moment.|`|7h91Cc4raa	Yeah like the others said no martial art is better. they all have different goals and techniques. I have trained in a fair few as Im a mma fighter.  I personaly like Brazillian Ju-jitsu, combatsombo, sub wrestling and boxing....with one or 2 kicks added in.   Its not a case of which is the best one its a case of which one suits you. And if you can find one then mix it up. It all depends on your reasons for wanting to do martial arts.  I used to train at Ian Freemans place and nearly everyone used to have a different style. Of cours is style was ground and pound which works for him but not for a smaller guy like me.    Hope it helps somewhat.|`|gJ3Y1Kycaa	no art is better than another art. some people claim to do 'the best' art but these people are just ignorant. you will hear a lot of people going on about how good gracie jujitsu is and these people will rubbish any other art because of what they have seen on youtube!!! ok it has its good points and works successfully in mma but would you want to take a fight to the ground in a bar brawl? iwouldn't.     people forget that the gracies perfected that style of jujitsu and were masters at it. they were very very good fighters, but thats down to their personal ability and commitment to their art. and thats what its all about. you wont just learn a martial art properly in a few weeks or by reading a book you need years and years of hard work both physically and mentally. therefore you need to be doing an art which you enjoy or you simpily wont be able to stick with it.     hope this helps|`|wBy6QIElaa	tae kwon do|`|ev8okt3Qaa	No martial art is better than any other martial art.  A skilled practitioner of taekwondo will beat a poor practitioner of muay thai, whereas a skilled practitioner of muay thai will beat a poor practitioner of taekwondo.     A skilled practitioner of taekwondo and a skilled practitioner of muay thai will be about equals, and should realize that fighting each other is against the spirit of the martial arts.    In conclusion, it all depends on the person teaching you, really.|`|YKOu2jhFaa	That's a pretty vague question, but I think the most practical for real life is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.. Research says some 70% of fights go to the ground and thats where BJJ is focused.. Look at the very first UFC's, that was when one martial art was against the other, Royce Gracie won the first couple with BJJ.. Then everyone started incorporating it in their style.. So I say the most practical is BJJ..|`|wrS5nguKaa	Why do people say fights go to the ground in a real fight you go to the ground you will get stomped to death. People go to the ground that do not know how to fight so they grab each other and hug each other on the ground or somebody just got "Knocced the F %$ out."     There is no better Martial Art there are only better fighters. I've seen street fighters put martial artist to sleep with one blow, I've seen martial artists man handle thugs on the street, and I've seen warriors battle it out in tournament from all styles and systems. It's the heart that makes the warrior not the style or system.|`|RQRGQgk3aa	The "best" martial art is one that covers all three ranges of combat, Striking, Clinch, and Ground. Trains in an alive manner with full resistance. Includes multi-attacker and weapons based scenarios also trained in an alive manner with full resistance. Encourages competition in the most realistic possible environment, and awards rank based on performance.  Right now to get that you would have to train something like Muy Thai + BJJ or Boxing + Judo or Kyokushin + Wrestling to get your striking and your clinch and ground work. Then add a good Krav Maga school for multiple attackers and weapons based scenarios.  It's hard to find Krav Maga schools that train in an alive manner depending on where you are in the world, but they do the best that I've seen at multiple attacker training and weapons based defense.  I've never encountered an art or a school that has effectively combined those qualities, but I'm sure there is one out there.|`|I2fIfGUqaa	I do Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, If you hear anyone say fighting on the ground is bad, they don't know Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. it is all ground based and finding the perfect time to strike, staying clam, and eliminating bigger and stronger enemies. I go every Tuesday, I improve and I get stronger every second from it. First time you might want to not go back because of the workout, well the place I go to does workout that strains us. But yes, workout is tough, especially if your fighting a person who weights more then you and is on top of you. It teaches you all submission from gaurd and mount, all effective take downs, and effectiveness for everything ground based. The only problem is once you join, or if you go they may not do this but at my place, when I joined my fist got registered meaning I could not use my fists as weapons in any school fight or anywhere on PURPOSE. If you get into a school fight and it wasn't you who started it then I am alright and can still participate. I joined over the passed 2 years, i have been in competitions where i fought people who do not practice Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, they are tough but not as tough on the ground, a simple take down for me and I was in. It's up to you though but I practice this for 2 years now and my body has gone through pain. But remember, it only comes in handy when you can get the opponent on the ground or at least into a guard position on ground.|`|vecyklHEaa	judo isn't a bad way to go, some sources say its the  2 most participated in sport in the world behind soccer ??? not sure if that is true|`|CdAE4nXcaa	all martial arts have their positives and negatives. if you train i none aspect of fighting such as tae kwon do for stand up, you will be at a huge disadvantage fighting sombody who does jiu jitsu because a jiu jitsu, judo, wrestling, ect will just take you down and submit you and if you don't know how to defend your self on the ground you lose. the best martial art is the one you create. create your own system that uses punches, kicks, elbows, knees, stand up grappling, takedowns, takedown, defense, and submissions. you can't be one dimensional or you will lose.|`|uepdHurFaa	i assume the tai chi answer was a joke?    thai for strikes (plus boxing)  wrestling for control and take downs  Jui jitsu for workiing off your back and submissions    If i had to be complete master in one  - for self defence - illd probab go for jui jitsu, because most fights end on the ground or its pretty easy to take it to the ground (street fight).   Still a hard leg kick is also very satisfying hmmmm?|`|b36a3ea5053129e74f60939bd03c219faa	Thats a difficult question. There have been a ton of people over the years past that ask that question. There is no clear answer either. Its whatever you dedicate your training to. It doesn't matter if one person has 20 years of training in say Capoeria and another in Brazilian jiujitsu, they both will be absolutely great at what they do. Now me, i love the art of muay thai. Its effective, strong, and not too fancy. It gets the job done for me. If you get into Muay Thai, I also recommend that your try to research the prelude into it know as Muay Boran, or "Ancient Boxing".

x6OsAvQeaa	Yes I think the Stars will make the playoffs. They have an awesome roster of guys, either active or injured. But when that whole team comes together, they are awesome to watch. Their depth down the middle is perhaps number 3 or 4 in the entire NHL. Modano, Ribeiro and Richards is a great group of centers. On defence Robidas is excellent and hes done well with Boucher now gone. Turco is phenomenal. I saw the highlights of Turcos last game, just unreal. Hes playing like the real Marty Turco. And Turco was always a top 5 or 6 goalie too. Great players always turn it up a notch in the second half. Guys like Modano and Richards have way too much pride to just slack off during the second half. They are both proven champions, either with Stanley Cup teams or internetional hockey teams. They know how to get it down and they will get it done. I really think Lehtinen is the best two way forward in the game. He has been for a while now. Hes very technically sound, just like Bob Gainey was with the 70s Canadiens. Always seems to be in the right spot, either offensively or defensively. Nothing fancy either, but he gets the job done. I also like Brenden Morrow on that team, hes real cocky and smart. Dallas is way too loaded to miss the playoffs. Unless they have a load of injuries down the stretch, this is a playoff team.|`|J84kcW2Zaa	dallas rocks!!!!!!!|`|WXdMHMfwaa	As a Vancouver Canucks fan, i honestly hope they dont make the playoffs.

I say the following factors come into play:    1. Turco must be excellent until the end of season  2. Phoenix Or Columbus must start to trail off and fall out of the playoff picture  3. Richards and Modano must turn it up a notch  4. Neal and Erikkson must maintain they goal scoring prowess  5.

85faaa69d9e3fef474608806f4554398aa	When you are hunting and kill an animal, there is no need to "bleed" it. I have no idea how this practice got started unless it was by people that raised animals for food and slaughtered them this way and just carried it over into hunting. After the animal is dead the heart isn't pumping, so cutting the throat doesn't do anything  cut in the hide and meat. Some blood that's pooled in the neck might come out but that's it. When you field dress the animal, most of the blood will drain out. After I finish gutting my deer I roll them over onto their stomachs and spread the hind legs to keep the body cavity open and hold the head up for a minute and any blood in the neck will drain out. Just field dress the animal and you'll be fine. Good luck with your hunting.|`|AA12034449	Depends... when I slaughter domestic meat we stun and cut... the heart pumps the blood till death occures.    Cutting the juglar and hanging will get some blood out of a hunted carcass.... but I'd estimate a good 85% of blood pools in the body  core and will come along when you dump the viscerals during the gutting process.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	most bullet designs now cause enough damage that the bullet wound is usually all you need to bleed the animal.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	It really depends on how you kill it.  If you are slaughtering, cutting the throat and letting them bleed out works just fine.  If it is a game animal, and you have put a broadhead or a decent expanding bullet through its heart and lungs, there may not be a whole lot left to bleed out.  If it is a larger animal, I would cut the throat before I started gutting it, and try to get the head and neck downhill from the body if I am opening it on the ground.  If I am hanging it up to clean, it is a moot point.  Whatever you don't get out through the wound or neck cut will probably be in the body cavity when you gut them.  Especially if your bullet or arrow went through there.|`|jbOnLIDeaa	A straight knife through both carotid arteries is normally the best bet but that depends on what it is and how it was taken down (the neck must be the lowest point of the carcass that you want, for this to be efficient). Slashing the throat contaminates the neck meat with stomach contents, this is just my experience.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	either way is good as long as it is bled...and the bible says that is sufficient and the meat does not have to be squeezed or soaked to get all the blood out of the muscles.|`|d64c3953306b85c73ccc73592488a6e3aa	The older ppl.where I came from would hang up pigs ,goats etc.with their heads down and in cutting their throat and jugular area much or most of the blood would run out in just a few minutes and your second answerer hits some good points in fallen game animals. However a well bled animal will taste better similar to a fish ie. a codfish that's taken over the side of a boat ,gutted immediately will always taste better .Hanging the quarters for a number of days will help this process as well as stretch the meat .------Good points Debbie--long proven points|`|HkMhWvtgaa	Cutting the throat (or anywhere else) after the heart has already stopped will not cause much more blood to drain out than has already been lost at that point.  When morticians embalm a body, they have to use a pump to force embalming fluid in and blood out through the body's circulatory system.    In a hunting situation, especially with a bow, the animal has often bled to death, so relatively little blood remains within the flesh.  If the deer bleeds mostly internally (as may happen if the arrow cuts the aorta, for example), then a lot of that blood will be trapped in the abdominal cavity until the animal is gutted, but it will still have been pumped out of the blood vessels in the body.      A gunshot wound may cause death as much by shock as hemorrhage, so there will sometimes be a little more blood left when the animal dies, but it will not harm the meat.  If you wish, you may remove more blood by soaking the meat in saltwater.|`|cobI4JIzaa	if you killed it it wont bleed,the heart isn't pumping.you can hang it and drain it.
a6EndAPiaa	It depends what you mean by a bad defense.  There have been lots of teams who have won who were not in the top 7 or 10 in defense the year they won.      4 teams won the super bowl and their defense was in the lower 50% of defense that year:  Raiders 1976  Redskins 1987  Patriots 2001  Colts 2006    For the record I am using Defensive yards given up because that is what the NFL uses as the primary defensive statistic.

Look at the grain (lines). For a durable bat that won't crack, you want them to be long and wide.|`|3BHmXNacaa	The most durable is bamboo.  If you don't mind spending 75$ for a good wood bat, I suggest the Mizuno Bamboo model they have out.  I forget the exact model but it's very nice!

Some manufacturers are back ordered for months......    Rock River Arms, DPMS and Bushmaster all make a fine product... Colts are decent -- The Olympic is alright -- a little on the lower end of quality but they are reliable....

If one is close to what you want and available just buy it -- You can always change the uppers later.......|`|AA12034449	All AR platform rifles are modular and pretty much interchangable for parts. There are some Colt Lowers that came with odd sized take down pins and those will only work with Uppers drilled for the same pins.    For the money Bushmaster, SW, Colt, Rock River are all about the same... you will pay more for the Colt name..but the quality is about even.    When you do compare look at twist rates, chrome vs non chromed BBls and chambers, sight groups, Match triggers, bbl weight and profile... make sure the specs are apples -apples ( and what you want) then shop price|`|dfBwVxXFaa	I am a fan of bushmaster. Also check Rock river arms.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Your a little late you know that right? Any of those makes you brought up would be the better brands. But since you waited so late in the game your going to be paying more than 4 months ago. I hope you have $1500 saved up becuase that's how much it's going to run you.    All ar's can be customized the same way. AR's are all the same internally and therefore parts can be interchanged. Bushmaster wouldbe the most reliable but the AR in general is not as relaible as some other weapon as the platform itself is built to tight tolerances so a little foreign debris can cause jams.|`|5mxy4WaMaa	You're too late to the game to be picky.  Get whatever you can while you can.
q8dX0MsNaa	all the manufacturers make good reels that will suit your purpose. pick one you like but get the BEST you can possibly afford. the extra bucks you spend will be money well spent. quantums and shimanos are fine reels but you gotta spend the money for best quality.|`|r6zLN0Daaa	I have 5 quantums and i love them.

For value, I would try a Pfleuger President. If money is no object, the Daiwa Steez is the best. Shimano is good from the Symetre line and up. I feel the Quantum reels are a little on the heavy side and not built as well as they used to be.|`|9koGSnd8aa	Check out this reel: http://www.cabelas.com/cabelas/en/templa...

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	In order to lose the fat you can do various things. Lifting weights (light weight, high reps) will help you tone muscle without bulking up. Core exercises like crunches, planks, v-sits, long-lever sit ups, rope climb, etc will help tone the abs. Adding some extra aerobic actviity or pushing yourself harder during your current training sessions will help. You should aim for a balanced, healthier diet, not necessarily a low-calorie diet. Look to eat fruits and vegetables instead of packaged soups and leftovers. Try peanut butter (and jelly if you like jelly) sandwiches for breakfast or a bagel with cheese - something that has protein and carbs and is lower in fat and preservatives.  On the weekends or when you have some down time, cook some chicken breasts so they are ready for you to heat up when you get home. Boil rice or noodles to go with it. Snack on carrots and other raw veggies and fruit, granola bars, craisins, trail mix and other stuff before or after practice. These things are just as quick and easy as leftovers and are far healthier and will last longer. You are doign your body a disservice by training so hard and then eating whatever you can find. Otherwise you're on the right track! Keep pushing yourself, start doing some light weights and you will see a difference!    Good luck!|`|cWfTvJTcaa	Keep swimming and walking. You will want to keep swimming even though your season is over, anyway, because you want to stay in shape for next year. Add running if you have the time. Aerobic exercise is where you will actually burn fat. Watch what you eat (sounds like you're doing pretty well already) and get enough sleep. Try not to stress about schoolwork or friends, because stress makes people gain weight. Learn some exercises that focus on toning the muscles of your stomach.|`|aQLTXwUbaa	Stuff like ramen noodles and prepackaged foods can be horrible.  Ramen is packed with hydrogenated oils - that means FAT.    Good for you not having soda, i would add: have no fruit juices or sweet teas or sports drinks either. No energy drinks.  Just water and skim milk, or non-sweet tea.  Diet sodas are another option if you must.    I would reduce your carb intake as hard as that sounds, especially being a swimmer. Not to zero but to maybe 1/4 of your calories. Especially try to limit bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, unless they are whole grain. Some rice has a lower glycemic index which would be okay - like glutinous rice.   For snacks when you are starving, have all the fruits and fresh vegetables you want, or cheese sticks and whole wheat crackers  - like triscuits or wheatsworth or other brands.  Nuts are great, delicious, and filling.  A cup of yogurt is good too although can be high in sugar so be careful. You need to maintain variety though so that you enjoy eating.    You need to eat small amount often throughout the day. Try to avoid being in a starved state because those are danger times. Have the rescue foods available just at those moments.    Finally, know that your weight is fine for your height, and your fitness is the major important factor here.|`|w13Zbnk7aa	I am a swimmer as well. I am 5 3 and about 125lbs...I am struggling with loss of cardio because of shoulder reoccurring injuries, so I know what it means to want to make the best of swimming.    Sounds like you are doing a lot of good things. Scientifically, it is easier to loose weight in LONG practices (the ones everybody dreads). Here are some ideas about how you could maybe practice on your own:    If you find free pool time do long sets.  [5200]2 on 3:00 (this is is you 100 free time is around 1:04 or 1:05).  1000 yards free swim. Pace yourself almost like you are swimming the 500 and time yourself each time (or have somebody time you). Try to take off 5 seconds a week. This goal will make you faster as a swimmer and maybe help you toward your goal. I admire your dedication!
s4VzPulYaa	Probably Jay Cutler the quarterback.<br>  I realize that they are both athletes, but Jay Cutler the QB focuses on more than one aspect of his athleticism. He not only works on throwing the football, he also has to work with a little bit of running, and things like that, also Jay Cutler lifts weights to keep him strong too. I know that he probably doesn't lift weights quite equal to Jay Cutler the bodybuilder, but he still lifts weights.<br>  As to where Jay Cutler, only lifts weights, and tries to get stronger. He adds no more athletic ability than being strong. <br>  In my book, being athletic involves being able to do more than one thing with your ability. So I would say Jay Cutler the quarterback.

DV61eR5iaa	Well first off figure skating is more a woman thing. You dance around on skates, do flips, twirls, skate in all diferent directions and skate in the mood you feel like to the song or routine. Hockey is a tough man sport where you skae around with a puck trying to score on the oppenetents net. You do steling, bodychecking and fights, you can also get in the penalty box for rough playing. GO SABRES!|`|MDhI4mBEaa	Figure skates have the teeth on the front edge so you can do those spins and twists and flips and all that crazy S* T. No teeth on hockey blades.|`|yPRhc6oWaa	jk brown 24 your so wrong its not s**t you:*|`|IsQckOXraa	hockey skates don't have toe picks (the pointy thing at the top of the blade) the blade is more rounded  figure skates have a toe pick and the blade is flatter  people usually say hockey skates are easier to skate with because begginners sometimes will trip over the toe pick of a figure skate hockey skates also allow you to go faster once you are starting off with skating because their is no toepick.

Animals classified as predators in Idaho include coyotes, jackrabbits, skunks, weasels, and starling. The most frequently hunted unprotected animals include marmots, fox squirrels, porcupines and Columbian ground squirrels, English sparrows, Eurasiancollared doves, and feral pigeons. These species may be taken in any amounts and at any time by holders of the appropriate valid Idaho hunting, trapping or combination hunting license, provided such taking is not in violation of state, county, or city laws, ordinances or regulations.    Protected Nongame Wildlife, Species of Special Concern, Threatened or Endangered Species, Protected Birds  Special classifications for some animals extend extra protection to those species. These animals cannot be hunted, taken or possessed. Threatened or endangered wildlife, including caribou, Canada lynx, gray wolf, grizzly bear, Northern Idaho ground squirrel. Protected nongame wildlife include red (pine) squirrel, wolverine, chipmunks, rock squirrel, Wyoming ground squirrel (nevadensis subspecies only), golden-mantled ground squirrel, Merriams ground squirrel, Piute ground squirrel, pika, kit fox, northern flying squirrel, bats, Southern Idaho ground squirrel and migratory song birds.

If the land isn't held by a private individual, it is the property of the town, or the county, or the state or the Federal government...and you need written permission from whichever of those has authority over the property.  You will have to abide by any and all restrictions.  Don't be so foolish as to think you can get off by saying "We didn't know this was not allowed"...

It would be tough to get to the pro level with hard work alone--there are too many people with talent who also work just as hard, and since they get more out of their training it would be hard to compete with them.  <br>  <br>  Another factor to look at though, is how much you love the game.  A study was done to find out what the difference between a chess master and a chess grandmaster is (other than their rating).  They checked IQ, ability to see spacial relationships, and a lot of other things people thought would make you a good chess player.

3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	This is a poor design that is more than likely a waste of money. The bolt cover on an AK is basically a clipped on sheet metal cover. It is not a stable platform for any kind of sight or scope.     For a sight or scope to have or maintain any kind of accuracy, it has to be rock solid with the gun's barrel/receiver assembly.     I suggest you sell off this POS to some other person and invest in a set of Mojo Sights for the AK.|`|UJmfDAI9aa	dust cover mounts suck dude.Good luck getting one that can hold a zero. The ones i've seen that hold it better than others are the ones that have the metal tab on the front of the dust cover that wedges itself right under your rear sight, in addition to the wedge screws on the back.|`|AA12274507	Everyone here is right. Almost impossible to get a aim point to hold it's zero on the bolt carrier cover. If you get a mount that goes on top of the gas tube than that is quite a bit more stable, but even then it will still move somewhat.|`|cobI4JIzaa	put the red dot on a good rifle and use the yugo for a boat anchor....|`|OAEuYZkZaa	You are mounting your scope on a part that is removable and held on by a spring-loaded catch, and you are surprised it won't hold zero?    Trade your scope for an extended eye relief scope and set your scope up using the rear sight dovetail to mount the scope base.    Doc|`|OXJYXGDjaa	throw it in tha trash kkep tha ak-47|`|PgFYPZg2aa	Mounts are pretty important on stuff like that, you could try getting a new mount for the scope, although in my opinion I liked the iron sights better than my m68 red dot pile-o-poo.|`|f3f63c87e27f64c3e9f1679c165409b8aa	AK's were never designed to pin-point accuracy.  They were designed to operate in adverse conditions and to throw lots of lead out.   They are notorious for barrel wobble and very loose fits so they have poor accuracy.  Generally you're wasting your time to try to successfully site in a scope.  Just use the open sites and get close.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	i keep tellin' you kids those ak-47's are crap. you keep buyin' em. and wondering 'whats up with these things?'|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Yugoslavia never did make the best AK-47/SKS rifles....    But seriously? Putting a red-dot on an AK is about like.... I can't even come up with an analogy for that. Suffice to say it's a waste of time and money....    The Red Dot is more accurate than the rifle.     AK-47s were not made for high-end accuracy. They were made to work everytime, and be easy for conscripted peasants to use.     Kinda like the Mosin Nagant, actually...    Put your old bolt carrier back in, or get a light or a mag carrier for the rail, and put the red dot on something that will not throw the zero off.|`|cmvPENvoaa	toss it. cover mounted rails are notorious for not holding zeros due to recoil. why do you want the red dot sight anyway?|`|SWqqjjPwaa	If your Mount has a little lip on the front of it try either shimming it or bending the lip down a little with a pair of pliars...I had to Shim my Mak-90 and locktite the allen head bolts on the back my rifle holds a good zero though...all the way out to 100 yards so far.... ive got a BSA red dot on mine and it works well

It's his butt on the line if you do something with the handgun once you have the permit, they don't take that position lightly any more, my judge gave one out without a meeting and the guy killed his own brother 3 days after he got it... judge has NEVER done a permit since without a meeting in person.  Who can blame him?  Good luck.|`|TEAKcA5Laa	i hope i'm wrong, but i think you may have just pissed away 200 bucks.|`|N8BbxwrGaa	Sorry to say this, but really? Cocaine possession, and indiscriminate shooting while drunk at night.    Come on, these are just the sort of acts the spell out trouble with a handgun. Your previous life choices show you decision making process is severely flawed. When carrying a deadly force concealed one needs to make good decisions all the time,     Please for the sake of all our safety and the preservation of pistol permit rights, and so your not embarrassed (he will find out all the details as you have to release it all), just chalk off the 200$ and cancel    In N.Y. they can find out if your great Aunt changed the name of her dog when it comes to a pistol permit.    sorry

Darrell Green was playing his first game back after surgery to put a plate into his arm to repair a broken bone.  Michael Irvin said "I am going to target Darrell Green's arm".  At the end of the game Green covered Irvin on every passing play.  Irvin targeted Green's arm to 2 catches one of which Green forced into a fumble.  Hey Irvin target this!!!!    2) Shannon Sharpe ( who said words to the effect of "I reinvented the TE position.  All TE's now play the way I did" hmm oh really I thought that was Mike Ditka and Kellen Winslow.  He is such a blow hard.    3) TO    4) Dion Sanders (he is not higher because it is not bragging if you can do it -- and love him or hate him he could and did do it).|`|acWyJ3t0aa	He is now that Michael Irving is in the broadcast booth , but both were created and babied along by their surrogate father Jerry Jones|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Shannon Sharpe easily|`|mUG8XtNpaa	Today?

4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	I read that Mickie Rourke won't be wrestling Chris Jericho at WM 25 after all.Instead it looks like he's just appearing at the ppv to show his support for the competing wrestlers.Chris Jericho will likely continue to work his heel persona as he tries to build up momentum for a possible spot in the Money In The Bank match and a future shot at John Cena's WHC title.|`|8DIkez2uaa	No, but this is going to be one of the worst fueds, and worst matches in the history of Wrestlemania. It is wasting Chris Jericho's talent when he should be facing Austin for his proper farewell. We all know that Jericho would kick the crap out of Rourke in real life even though Rourke will win, so what is the point? It will be a **** match and the rivalry will give Rourke more of a spotlight than the WWE Superstars.    And to answer your question, no. WWE isn't like TNA where guys turn heel/face every other week. Besides, Raw needs him. Raw has 3 major heels right now, Orton, JBL, and Jericho. JBL is fat, Orton can't cut a good promo to save his life, and that leaves Jericho, he's boring as Hell but Raw needs him cuz they have no other heels that would be considered for the title picture.|`|tFZaBGHZaa	First off I have no idea why WWE wants to bring in a celebrity to wrestlemania... If they want more viewers why don't they just improve the wrestling part instead of the entertainment part.    That being said, hopefully this will turn Jericho into a face or a tweener though i have no idea how this is going to end up.    he should have been in the MITB ladder match instead.|`|X9COVKyzaa	AS u know wrestling is fake. But it seems like jeryho hates mickey.

It is considered the flagship pay-per-view event of WWE, as it is the most successful and longest-running professional wrestling event in the world.  Numerous celebrities such as Muhammad Ali, Mr. T, Alice Cooper, Lawrence Taylor, Pamela Anderson, Mike Tyson, Donald Trump, Floyd "Money" Mayweather, Snoop Dogg, Raven-Symone, Kim Kardashian and others have participated or made special appearances in the events.|`|jYuAkjBNaa	Don't know! Rourke was pretty bad in his day and he would have kicked the @ $^ out of Jericho in a real fight, but now hes old and it would be unfair......but Randy Coutor is old and he is one bad dude.  Wrestling is fantasy and UFC is real.|`|Xu7hey6Laa	Hey Brandon!    The only way I can see Jericho becoming a face out of this is if people just don't get Rourke.  If some people haven't seen The Wrestler (and I recommend that all wrestling fans should see it - it's awesome!), they aren't going to get it.  In turn, they might end up turning on Rourke and cheering Jericho.  Kinda like Big Show and Mayweather.  Mayweather was really supposed to be the face in that feud, but everyone (including me) couldn't stand him.  That's when they started cheering for Show.      So, I hope that it plays out as Rourke/face and Jericho/heel.  Jericho's so dang good at being a heel that he could really put Rourke over.
aHmrd3tiaa	That's a tough one, since you'd have to be great to become one of the greats...but one in recent memory is Kurt Warner.<br>  <br>  Here's a blurb on him from Gregg Easterbrook of ESPN's Tuesday Morning Quarterback: Undrafted out of Division I-AA Northern Iowa, waived by the Packers, three years in the Arena League, a year with the Amsterdam Admirals, a year on the bench at St. Louis, NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in his first season as an NFL starter -- then his story gets interesting. Run of out town on a rail by the Rams, a year being booed with the Giants, signed with Arizona as veteran insurance and written off by touts and scouts. Now he's back in the Super Bowl.|`|a6EndAPiaa	For my money it would have to be an undrafted Hall of Fame player or a Hall of Famer who was taken in a very late round of the draft.<br>  <br>  So I would have to go with the following three in no particular order<br>  Dick "night train" Lane (undrafted)<br>  Bart Starr (200th pick 17th round)<br>   David "Deacon" Jones (186th pick 14th round)|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Jack Lambert<br>  Donnie Shell<br>  John Stallworth<br>  LC Greenwood<br>  Fats Holmes<br>  Hines Ward|`|jGZb7xnDaa	Joe Montana - 3rd round pick 1979<br>  Shannon Sharpe - 7th round 1990<br>  Kurt Warner - undrafted, we all know the story<br>  James Harrison - cut 4 times, undrafted<br>  Adam Vinitieri - undrafted<br>  Rod Smith - undrafted<br>  <br>  I am sure there are many more, these just come to mind.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Joe Montana (3rd round pick)<br>  Kurt Warner (undrafted)<br>  Tom Brady (what was he, 7th round?

Came out of nowhere to win 3 superbowls in his first 4 seasons. Best win % in playoffs ever, best record to start career after 100 games, holds touchdown record. Even though the Pats lost the superbowl he is still the only qb to lead his team to an 18-0 record. Won 21 straight games twice. 28 4th quarter come from behind wins most in nfl since he came in. There are plenty of guys you could make this argument for.

fQifcI9oaa	Honestly dude I don't have the headphones but I've seen them and I don't think you will be able to.  That being said..    About a month ago was my birthday and I got $300 so I bought these headphones that had been getting mixed reviews. They are $120 and then I bought a seperate reciever for $50. The headphones are wireless and go right behind your ear. They are black, and sweatproof. And no matter how much you jump twirl run or snowboard they NEVER fall off. They are called the Jaybird 200-01. I bought a different reciever because the set you can buy which includes the headphones and a reciever is stupid. The reciever only gets 4 feet. The reciever I bought gets me 15-20 feet. I don't know if this helps at all but if you have some money I think you should get them!   both works with ipods!

I have the skullcandy ink'd headphones but I never took them snowboarding (mainly because I don't want to break my iPod.) but if you still have the receipt or you can return them I would get in-ear headphones or something like it, I recommend the ink'd ones i payed $16 for them at target and they are awesome.
KDOIKIq2aa	For the most part a bullet is classified by three criteria.  First is bullet diameter.  In your case 9mm.  Second is bullet weight.  This is whether it is lead or jacketed, such as your FMJ, for the fact jacketed bullets can be pushed faster down the barrel.  You can substitute across manufactures as long as it is for the same size, same weight and same construction (Lead/Jacketed).    Most powder manuals list bullets by weight and either lead or jacketed to work with their powders.  Bullet manuals tend to list their bullets and what powders work well for them and in the case of Hornady only the loading they found are the best.    One other word Barnes bullets are solid copper and need to be loaded with Barnes data in mind because of this.|`|AA12034449	If you look around at enough manuals you should be able to find load data for just about everyones bullets or powders.    115 grain is 115 grains... and if you pay attention to any thing about reloading START LOW WATCH FOR PRESSURE AND WORK UP|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	You can use the same starting load, but don't trust the maximum. Even if they look alike, different brands will have different amounts of bearing surface, different ogive shapes, and possibly different alloys in both core and jacket. With some magnum rifle cartridges, even the starting load won't be the same, but with the nine, it won't be off enough to matter if you're careful.|`|FUc5BQtEaa	The difference between bullets with brands is minimal. Some people just trust one company over another. Personally, I like Hornady, and I know what you mean about wanting something cheaper to load with. If I were to sujest a bullet brand, I would go with bulk Winchester, bulk Speer, Or what ever you are willing to purchase. You really can't go wrong with any brand so long as the bullet has a full metal jacket.

es2RDKqQaa	im a figure skater that started when i was 6 lol but my friends who are 15 as well always come and watch me and there always like "i wana try!" so they got in "CANSKATE" with the little kids, they moved up the levels fairly quickly because they were older and the teacher didnt want them to hurt the really younger kids haha, but eventually they went from being with 6 year olds to being with 10 and 12 year olds which wasnt that bad because they were around the same height. At the end of the year they got to do an iceshow, the dressed up in costumes and went out to the music, they were the oldest ones there off course but they had fun and it was a laugh, and now they are good enough to compeate in a competition! Ask one of your friends to join with you, because you wouldnt be the only "tall old girl" or maybe go in and watch the lessons and see if there are people, just go and sit in the stands lol.

vqm10k3Jaa	-_-; I'm guessing they don't have much self-esteem for themselves either, (mom sucks up to boyfriend to get his acceptance an feel wanted, sister takes attention off her own in securities by trying to put it onto yourself when your brave enough and smart enough to look for ways to improve yourself and become a better person) Anyway (sorry) thats another subject, your asking about running.  You didn't specify your age, height, or weight so it's difficult for me to get a picture of what kind of condition your in physcially.    Shoulda seen me on the football field my first time, I didn't know what lineback, defensives, or tackles were so you can imagine some people teasing me, but I got better and became a good linemen. (one of the supposely big guys up front)  I was the only skinny linemen but I took advantage of my ability to lower my center of gravity and took on guys 2 or 3 times my on weight.  (Sorry I'm running on)      Everyone has to start somewhere and the only way to improve or get better is to do.  Will this take time? yes it most likely will.  Like anything else like math, english, drawing etc. You have to start first, then practice to get good.  Get close with your couch, have her offer you tips (she should do this without asking, but do that anyway)  or ideas on ways to better your technique, what kind of foods would be good to try or eat. Ask what you can do on your own time after track practice  Get your rest at night time.  And in time you will be glad you did it.    Bottom line.  DO IT!!!  For the sake of yourself.  You have my Support, Blessing, Prayers.        And don't forget the support of everyone else here.    (If you want more tips or info, just email me and I'll be happy to answer any questions you have to the best of my knowledge and experience).|`|KoJ0rddfaa	go prove them all wrong. when you feel you are about to call it quits, remember how they didn't think you could do it. it will be hard at first, not going to lie to you about that. BUT you will improve really fast. i know i did with cross country.    best of luck to you! and besides, you best friends are doing it so it should be fun!|`|bvatbDxeaa	I say you should totally run.

That ain't right.  Parents are supposed to be excited about the kids' sports.      Track is a great sport.  Even if you're not any good, it will still get you in fabulous shape.       I went out for track in college to get in shape for wrestling even though I'd never run more than a mile before.   It worked. I was terrible at track, but by the time wrestling season came around, I never had to worry about my weight or being gassed at the end of a match.|`|fOMcLCCcaa	Yeah! I think you should still try it.  Your team mates and coaches will be supportive of you.. I think that's more important.|`|TKNPveHDaa	Now you HAVE to work hard and succeed at track.  They all basically challenged you to give your full effort and go out and perform.  My suggestion is to take the feelings of hurt you have and disappointment, and use that while you run.  Keep that feeling and let it drive you to be good at track.    And you'll meet a bunch of new people and make new friends.  Who doesn't want new friends?  No matter how slow you are, your trackmates will push you and motivate and cheer you on.  If your family won't, the other kids at track will.    Good luck!|`|KsZQQkBfaa	wow, your mom sounds like a *****. (no offense)     i say do it and don't stop even if it doesn't work out right away    at least then you'll know you tried|`|ff9f1d5eaf18f8ddce60f0c457c5acd2aa	Why wouldn't you ?  With everyone putting you down that should give you more motivation to do your best. Run track kid, and when that season is over continue to run and work out. Get on another team after track season is over. Maybe softball|`|AxH9mWKkaa	Use their negativity to fuel you more. If you don't have a severe physical debilitating attribute then you can run! Trust me. I was never a runner and I am now in college and have decided to run a half-marathon. It is more mental than anything else, so just don' tlet other people get you down. Your friends are joining with you so they will provide a great support system. You can't succeed if you don't try, so why not give it a shot. If it is not for you thats ok, but if you set your mind to it, you can run!

D1beU6MPaa	We almost had one last year. Several have won the Derby and Preakness only to come up short in the grueling Belmont. We have not had a Triple Crown winner in thirty years now. My opinion is breeding. Years ago horses were stronger and more sturdy than they are today. Today, they are bred to be streamlined speed-balls, and are more fragile. The jury is still out on artificial surfaces. In fact there is an inquiry going on right now because of eight breakdowns at Turfway which does have poly track.  I go to New York every year for the Belmont Stakes. Although Big Brown was a heavy favorite last year, I still had my doubts. I was standing in line for the ladies room and some ladies started asking me questions about Big Brown. They wanted to know if I thought he would win. I just said, "this is a horse race, and although heavily favored, he could lay an egg". He plopped a big one huh?  But I do think we will see another Triple Crown winner. But it will be that very special horse to do it.|`|aeODdMATaa	I think we will, when a really great horse comes along. It keeps getting close every year so I'm hoping in like maybe 5 years we will finally see one.|`|KVlRYoidaa	not this year.|`|URO3gDXcaa	i think we will see one in the next 5 years.|`|DLxh9CANaa	The NTRA will have a LONG, HARD, fight ahead of them if they want to force the Triple Crown racetracks at Churchill Down, Pimlico, and Belmont to change their racing surfaces. The jury is still out on Polytrack- and from the looks of things, it may very well prove to be even more risky to run horses on than the dirt tracks are now. Just take a look at the artcle in the Yahoo Sports section about the 7 horses which have died at Santa Anita in the last two weeks, because the polytrack surface there FROZE in the cold weather they've been having. The horses ran on the frozen track and broke their legs because of it- evidently, polytrack which is frozen can be rather unforgiving to a horse's legs. Dirt tracks DON'T freeze, at least not easily, and efforts can actually be made to prevent this from happening. Polytrack, on the other hand, is clearly a different story, because if it doesn't drain right, the water which gets on it will freeze up. Santa Anita has had serious problems with its track ever since they changed the footing there- remember how the track was CLOSED for almost 6 weeks last winter due to drainage problems and freezing? If they are having problems, then think for a moment about what might happen at a place like Belmont, which gets LOTS of cold weather, ice, and snow in the winter months. Pimlico and Churchill get lots of cold, snowy, icy weather too, and putting polytrack on them makes little sense if it means these tracks are going to have to be closed in the winter months due to freeze ups. Santa Anita is located in a relatively mild winter climate, and they still have had issues- do we really need to see this happen on the Triple Crown tracks? As far as whether or not there will be another TC winner in the near future, I think NOT, for any number of reasons.  Today's horses are NOTHING LIKE the animals which were running only 25 years ago, when I was in high school. Breeders today are breeding for speed and looks, NOT soundness and athleticisim, and it SHOWS. Making matters worse is the fact that the Thoroughbred as a breed has been overbred and inbred so much that the GENE POOL has SHRUNK- it's less than a third the size it was only 50 years ago. Horses' overall speeds are becoming slower, not faster, and this is part of the reason why. As the bloodlines have become more and more concentrated, the incidence of preventable, hereditary defects ( such as the superfine,inherently WEAK bone structure which Eight Belles had, and which many of the horses running today also have) has risen sharply. One can only spin the genetic wheel in the same direction just so many times without DIRE consequences, and we are just starting to see the effect of DECADES of poor breeding decisions. This isn't rocket science, nor is it my imagination- it's just the reality of life in the racing business in the early 21st century. The laws of genetics are CLEARLY NOT working racing's favor right now.     Then there's the issue of economics in racing, and right now, the economics of the racing and breeding business are totally upside down and make no sense at all. This is the only industry that I am aware of in which it often costs more to PRODUCE the end product ( the young racehorse) than that product will often be WORTH, either during the horse's career or afterwards. Right now, top sires like AP Indy command stud fees of $300,000K or more, and that's JUST THE STUD FEE. It doesn't include all the numerous other expenses associated with supporting a mare or raising a foal. When breeders and owners have to make this kind of investment just to produce a foal, then they need a way to recoup their expenses as quickly as possible, or they can't stay in business themselves, much less provide jobs and benefits to their employees.This, more so than any other single reason I can point to, is the motivating factor behind the drive to start young horses under saddle and in training at the age of 18 months ( on some farms, it's 15) and race them as two year olds. It ALSO is what's behind the pressure to overfeed young horses as weanlings and yearlings in an effort to get them ready for the sales ring. But as anyone connected with racing knows, this pressure causes ENORMOUS problems, and is a major contributor to the tragedies we keep seeing on the racetracks. These horses are just TOO YOUNG and FRAGILE to be doing what is demanded of them without risking dire consequences. From Ruffian to Barbaro to Go For Wand to Pine Island and George Washington, the results are the same- horses break down because their bones and joints can't take the stress of all that pounding, no matter WHAT type of surface you are talking about. And these are just the famous horses- there are thousands of others which you never hear about, but which often suffer HORRIBLE fates, simply because they can't run fast enough or win enough to make them worth feeding or keeping alive. This ties in with, and goes back to what I said a moment ago- the racing business is one which is plagued by upside down economics. Horses which don't win enough get sold on- and a lot of them still get packed onto cattle trucks bound for the borders, since slaughter is illegal now in the US. Meanwhile, breeders overbreed their mares, and the cycle starts over again every spring. ( Foaling season has already started in places like Kentucky and Maryland as I write this, and it's expected that about 35 to 40,000 foals will be born before it ends in the late spring.)     It's common to hear of of horses being sold for record prices at the yearling sales, only to hear later that the same animals were total failures on the track. Bloodlines alone are not always a reliable predictor of performance, not these days. Being raised and trained by a top trainer is also not necessarily a good indicator of future performance. All these are reasons why I think it may be a long time before we see another triple crown winner. There is an outside chance that one of |`|IS6T13ttaa	ya we will have a triple crown winner this year.      p.s. ive been saying that for the last fifteen years.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	Its going to happen it almost did last year so it will happen in our lifetime.|`|XiDMIjXGaa	i betcha we will! its happened before, it'll happen again

Although I wouldn't count Mosley out, I still think that Mayweather won't prove himself until he cleans out his division. You know that's not going to happen...I think that Mayweather takes this one via split decision.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	6 or 8 years ago I would have bet the farm that Shane would have been the one to beat Floyd.  Truth be told my opinion hasn't changed, in fact I think the lay off will hurt Floyd.  Shane has remained reasonably active against some top notch competition, while Floyd has been watching from the sidelines for over a year.      I remember back to when Ray Leonard came back after a lengthy lay off to fight Hector Camacho.  Hector had been active, averaging about a fight a month and the difference showed.  Leonard did about as well against Camacho as DeLa Hoya did against Pacquiao.  Camacho's opposition for his previous 6 to 8 fights wasn't top notch, but his activity level was high and Leonard's ring rust showed glaringly.     I think the same will happen to Floyd if he comes back against Mosley.  Shane will give Floyd his first loss, and I think Floyd knows it too.  Odds are good if Mayweather comes back, it will be against Pacquiao, Floyd has always been at best leery of Shane, some even say Mayweather ducked Mosley outright.  Now that the shoe is on the other foot and Shane is calling the shots, things might be different and the fight might happen, but in my opinion it's a long shot.    I will stand pat with my previous claims.      Shane Mosley by decision over a rusty Floyd Mayweather.

You must be really flexible and in dance or something because I have been a flyer for five years and I can't do a Scorpion. You should definitely try out for cheering, you would be a great flyer. You should practice a heel stretch and other cheerleading moves. I am guessing that you can do them all pretty easily because a Scorpion, in my opinion, is the hardest thing to do. If you really want to practice, you should enroll in a tumbling class to learn how to do a back handspring. You would be a great cheerleader!<br>  <br>  Good luck =D|`|D6vDOkqHaa	you can start by practing cheers, working on tumbling, and some dances to get you flexible and ready for tryouts...if you want to be do backhand springs or learn to do those kind of stuff maybe taking some tumbling clasees will help|`|5de97489e8a440e9b2e1255938a501b5aa	juss keep stretching so your heel stretch, scale, scorpion, arabesque, are really good.  also just practice some tumbling skills-backhandspring, tucks... cuz u neva kno, they might come in handy :]<br>  another thing you can do is practice some cheerleading moves--but know the basics jumps-toe touch, front hurdler, pike

If money is no object, like that ever happens, BBR can custom build you a bike to fit your needs from both a size and performance perspective so you may want to reach out to those folks also. If you need any more help just shoot me an email.     http://www.crfsonly.com/catalog/index.ph...
afe603ba3e194df09373aa3fe7e6e4a8aa	It depends on the state laws where you live. Here in Ohio there is no permit needed or waiting period to purchase a handgun, just an instant background check. For concealed carry you must take a 12 hour course, then fill out an application and pay $55 at the Sherrif Dep't. They will do a background check and issue a license within 45 days if you're legal to carry. The license must be renewed every 5 years.   State laws are at the link below, check to see what is needed in the state you live in.  http://www.nraila.org/GunLaws/|`|AA12034449	that totally depends on the state you live in.    As of today ... Illinois and Wisconsin are the only 2 states that do not offer any kind of CCW permit.(last i looked anyway)    30 some odd states have SHALL issue laws for weapons permits.    Even California has a permit process... but they are very hard to obtain.    Purchase laws and waiting periods vary state to state also|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	I'm guessing your talking federal because like every question of this nature you leave out an important piece of info: The state.    You don't need a license to buy and own a handgun and you don't need one to carry openly either. Unless it concealed than you need a CWP. Any gun store has the ability to give info on where they are and what you need. But this is all federal.    Since you did not give the state  I have no idea what your state warrants.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	that requires 2 different things, a permit to purchase, which can be obtained at your local pd, and to carry you have to take a ccw class which your local pd can tell you when and where.|`|vea6mqPZaa	There is no Federal License at this point in time, but that is subject to change as in "Change we can believe in" obamanation    And since you did not say what state you live in I will presume Texas    Federal law states that you must be 18 to purchase a firearm, either long gun or handgun.    Federal law also states that FFL Dealers must not sell a handgun to anybody under the age of 21.    Texas law says that no minor (less than 18) may posses a handgun except for legal purposes.    You may apply for a CHL at  http://www.texasonline.state.tx.us/NASAp...        You will pay 140.00 for the application online.  They will mail you the paperwork. then you go take the class and upon passing the class you mail all the paperwork back. Then if all goes well in 6-12 weeks you will have your CHL.      Also, Texas is a free state, we have NO firearm registration unless the obamanation and his flunkies get HB-45 passed.    Texas requires you to be 21 to get a CHL unless you are active military then its 18|`|xcG5Tasiaa	What state do you live in?
ha36IgLkaa	You have a first choice up front to go with Mono or Braid? Personally I have mono as braided main line is banned on a few waters. I also prefer the slightly more forgiving nature of mono.    You have a huge choice of mono lines at your disposal and it can be very confusing choice. I have tried many of the current lines on the market by Korda, Fox, Gardiner, Daiwa, Shimano, Berkley, X-Line and a few more. I have so say that some are better than others a bit more abrasive with narrow diameters etc... to aid longer casting but generally there really is not much between them.    I have now gone full circle and use Daiwa Sensor Brown Mono 12lb for most of my fishing even in France at 6.99 it is half the price of all most all the other lines for 1160m. I have not only found it reliable but very abrasion resistant. Yes it is not the thinnest in diameter but that has never stopped me catching lots of fish with it.    Cheers  Phil

In that case, India will get 123 rating points, equal to that of South Africa but three less than Australia (126), calculated after Monday's fourth ODI between the Proteas and Ricky Ponting's men.     But if India lose 0-5 to the Lankans they would slip below New Zealand (113) into fifth position. Such a result would catapult Sri Lanka (107) to third spot.     Irrespective of India vs Sri Lanka result, South Africa will go to top of the table if they win the fifth and final match of the ongoing series against Australia in Perth on Friday.|`|jUQn2Etxaa	it will move to no2 and will have a 3 horse race between IND SA and AUS|`|9D1Ik6ptaa	India will be no. 1 after winning the series 5-0

I1w0HfQbaa	I have seen Angulo fight and his style is almost a perfect match for Mayorga. On the plus side, Angulo's handlers are carefully stepping up his level of competition in the professional ranks. They think Mayorga, already with seven defeats on his record, is on the decline and on his way out. They calculate with his loss to Mosley he is a "shot" fighter and he could be just another name and steppingstone for Angulo to beat up on his way to the top. They calculate wrong.    I have seen Mayorga's fight with Fernando Vargas and felt he fought a very educated fight: he was throwing bombs when need be but also patient and not the wild man we all know who was swinging for the fences against Cory Spinks. Also, it is true Mayorga lost quite a bit of fights but those losses were to the elite in boxing: Oscar De La Hoya, Shane Mosley, Felix Trinidad and Cory Spinks. That is nothing to be ashamed about losing to those guys. Also, most experts felt "El Matador's" fighting style would be tailor made for Shane Mosley but he gave Mosley a very difficult fight for the first few rounds before getting KO'd in the twelfth.     A lot of folks on the forum think Mayorga is past it, and they make compelling arguments. I am more inclined to think judging from his last two fights he has a little bit of juice left in him and the Angulo camp is biting off more than they can chew and have grossly underestimated Mayorga. Angulo has stepped up the level of competition but nowhere near the level of difficulty of a Mayorga. Their fighting styles are both similar but Mayorga is a more mature and smarter fighter as the years pass him by. Mayorga knows this is a must win situation for him. And I like him to win this fight by a sixth round KO.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	who cares about mayorga.  mayorga is a washed out fighter whos only talent is to trash talk his way to a fight and get his assed kicked later on.  this guy is all talk and no skill.  i cant even remember a defining moment in his career but i could remember how many times he was humiliated.|`|ecHcOpoXaa	Interesting question, seeing how Sugar Shane beat up an Invinible Margarito and ko'd him with his steel chin, it got me to think twice about htis matchup. Angulo fights very much like margarito although he is probably more technically sound and quicker, he has the same mentality. Mayorga is easy to hit but has a good chin and could tatke a shot and has good power. But i think Angulos counterpunching ability and faster hands will make the difference, and with Mayorgas defense which is pedestrian at best, i expect angulo to win by UD but i dont htink he has th e power to knock out someone like mayorga altho it is a possiblity. Yea, and i know where your coming from because he survive mosley for 12 rounds and fougth pretty good, but i think angulo will execute the gameplan shane was winning with and use it well. ANgulo UD|`|8oC5AHzNaa	Mayorga has a very good chance especially the way the veterans have been performing...He fought very well against Sugar...Angulo is slow and thats what was giving Mayorga problems in his fight against Sugar...Dont be surprised if Mayorga KO's the young Angulo...should be a great fight...|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Good question Cris; I am with Angulo. The boy got the power on both hands. And I have seen him take a punch. Mayorga is crafty though.  But new blood is comig in I am going with the younger boxer by KO.

You can get the gun for under $100 and spend the rest on ammo. 7.62x54R will work just fine on deer.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	I'll second the Stevens 200.  Best bang for your buck, so to speak.  If not, look at some of the single shot rifles out there.  Rossi, Remington, and NEF/H&R all make them in lots of calibers.  If you can hit your local gun stores and pawn shops, see what they have for used guns.  Also, if you are planning on getting a used rifle, check them out online.  Most are fine.  But some, like the Remington 710 and 770, are garbage, and should be avoided.  If it has all negative reviews online, don't get it.  If this is your first rifle, and you are planning on going hunting, get a real hunting rifle.  Don't try to fudge it with an old military rifle.  I love them, and hunt with them.  But don't handicap yourself with one until you have more experience, and know what to look for.  Some are great, others are junk.|`|vea6mqPZaa	For 250 you should be able to find a nice used 243 or 270    Your just going to have to look hard for one.

AA10702710	I am a 16 gauge fanatic myself.  I use it for most of my hunting when I can.  (Although I do admit a fondness for the .410 bore for small game.)    The only problem is that I rarely see rifled slugs on the shelves for the 16 gauge.  In fact, now that I think about it, I think I have one very old box (25) of Peters 16 gauge rifled slugs...and that's it.  I found it at a gunshop 20 years ago and purchased them...and never shot a single one.    20 gauge will be a better bet for deer hunting.  They make a wider range of ammo for the 20 ga. and the retailers are more apt to stock it.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	It is a very easy choice, get neither of those choices.  Get a 12 gauge.    Sure the 16 gauge is not much less powerful than the 12 gauge, but there are more different 12 gauge loads available and you can get 12 gauge shells anywhere that sells shotgun shells.  I've known of a friend who had to visit three different stores before he found 16 gauge shells.    20 bore shotguns are find for birds, and OK for deer, but a 12 gauge packs lots more lead (3/8 to 1/2 ounce more charge weight in the 12 gauge) into the shells than a 20 gauge. That means a slug that is nearly 1/2 ounce heavier than a 20 gauge, or 2 o3 three additional buckshot.     Doc|`|K5AeQuSNaa	If you can find slugs or buckshot for the 16, it would be the better gun for deer.  But since finding ammo is SOOOO much fun, I'd go with the 20, simply because you can walk into any store and find it.  You will probably end up using  2 or  3 buck in a 20 ga instead of the  0 or  1 that you would in a 16 ga, but that isn't that big of a deal.  And there are a lot more different slug loads out there for the 20.  16 is a bit of an oddball now.  12 and 20 have kind of taken over, and since 16 doesn't really do anything that one or the other can't, it is dying off.    p.s., If you were hoping to avoid the recoil by using one of those instead of a 12 ga, it won't help.  The recoil will be about the same with similar loads.|`|1577a1ef7a5596b228d3cc0ac8dfdc51aa	Get a 12 that shoots them all 870 rem. Make sure it shoots 3 1/2 inch shells.|`|VLXFPMOqaa	the 20 out of those two   but a 12 would be better   if your a kid or woried about the recoil the 12 isn't that bad my 20 kicks almost as hard but both are definatly shootable|`|svbFM4Zyaa	get a 12 gauge for deer or a rifle not shotgun. 16 gauge and 20 will kill deer but they are more bird guns.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	I am with Doc, neither choice.   Because of availability of ammunition I would not opt for a 16 gauge. Instead do consider a 12 with slugs for deer. the reason is simple. Mass at target of the slug.     1st a slug has an effective range of about 100 yards. (that's if your good.)   Ammunition manufacturer produce the small bore ammo is smaller quantities so you generally will pay a premium for the ammo.     As others have said, the Remington 870 is a very decent and quality firearm at a reasonable price. It is primarily available in 12 and 20 gauge.   20 gauge is adequate as a slug gun, but I believe when you are talking about hunting you want insure you don't leave a wounded animal. The more lead you throw down field in terms of mass to target the quicker the animal will drop.     Slugs do pack a recoil wallop. the one draw of the 12 over the 20 is a bit more recoil, but this can be compensated for with a decent after market recoil pad.|`|cmvPENvoaa	neither, get a 12 gauge rem 870. more power/ammo availability|`|UJmfDAI9aa	Well for Deer I would use a 16 gauge if faced with that choice, but why not a 12 gauge? Where I am you can't just walk into a wal mart and get 16 GA ammo cause it is scarce. Mostly 12GA, 20GA, and .410|`|KDOIKIq2aa	This day and age I'd go for a 20ga over a 16 gauge.  For the mear fact that more ammunition is made for the 20ga and most places stock something in 20ga.      Most 16 gauger's  will stand by their sweet sixteen, but try to find ammo for it and that will change your mind.|`|hdD7YcCqaa	the 16  gauge is a larger round but they are not as common as a 20 or 12. i hunt with a mossberg 500 20 ga. and i can drop a deer at 120+ yds.  with a sabot slug.     get a 12 if you can. if you can't get the 20 ga. the gun is lighter. and with the sabots the slug fly's more like a rifle. the only problem is the shells are $15 dollars a box|`|TBAfpnmgaa	The 16 has more power, but the 20 is a lot more common. You can buy ammo for the 20 at any sporting goods store or Wal-Mart in all sorts of shot sizes. I have a great old 16 gauge that I got from my grandfather, and I love it, but the ammo is almost impossible to find in anything other than 7-1/2 or 8 shot, or slugs.   I agree with most posters, get a 12 gauge. The ammo is everywhere and relatively cheap, and you can start out with light loads and grow into it.|`|5VELZt7Saa	get the 20 gauge it will knock deer down at 125 yard no problem,a rifled barrel and sabots should put you out to 175 yards easily|`|BTFFpdeOaa	go with the 20 gauge,remington 870 or mossberg 500. With a rifled barrel and the new hornaday SST slug you can easily shoot deer out to 150 yards! I switched to the SST slugs this past hunting season and it is the best deer slug I have used in the 20 years I have hunted!|`|d5efbdf3bdec3b545d4511e1d13018acaa	a 20 g doesn't have the distance they you would probaly need for deer.|`|BXSlZEfBaa	Go with 12 guage or 20 guage. the 16 guage ammo is harder to find and more expensive.|`|4MmGydYAaa	ive actually read that a 20 gauge kills deer more effectively than either a 12 or 16 gauge, i dont know why, but ballistically it performs better than a 12 or 20 gauge. I got some 20 gauge hornady bullets and was reading reviews here http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/29468-5.h...   that they were getting 6 inch groups at 200 hundred yards. unheard of, not anymore!    i would definitely go with the 20 gauge because shells/slugs are so readily available compared to a 16 gauge|`|t4UrqK4Raa	I'm not going to tell you 12 like everybody else cause you clearly didn't ask for our opinions on 12 gauges.    Get a 20 gauge. They are much easier to find shells for and if you want to end up shooting skeet or trap you can use 20 gauge in competitions unlike the 16 gauge. Just make sure you get a rifled barrel and the right choke/slugs for deer hunting.|`|CUPsQ4tRaa	A three-inch chambered 20 gauge is more adaptable than a 16 gauge and yes, a 12 gauge is a better choice than either.  Three inch saboted 20 gauge slugs from a rifled barrel are accurate and effective for deer to most reasonable ranges in this part of New York.  If you use a scope and limit yourself to 125 yards, no problems.|`|SWqqjjPwaa	If these are the onyl calibers you will go with I would get a 20 gauge remington 870 combo with the fully rifled barrel and the smoothbore 26-28 inch barrel...cant go wrong with the same thing in 12 gauge though...jmo|`|9xy1YEJLaa	Get a 20 GA Remington 870. That is what I use for deer. It has plenty of power for deer. I love my 16 GA for bird hunting, but you can't just run to the store and find shells. They don't make all the same shells for 16 GA as they do for 20 GA. If you get a rifled barrel for the 20 GA you can get Hornady SST shells and have 200 yard shots. I've had my Remington 20 GA since I was 12 and I love it for deer hunting.

LnJjS8BRaa	Personally at 15, I don't think you or anyone should be taking supplements unless prescribed by your doctor.    If you want to lose fat cut back on salt and red meat. Cut out sugar from pop and candy. Drink plenty of water and eat a lot of fresh vegetables and salad. Lean cuts of meat and fish are great sources of protein with very little fat.    Control your serving sizes and try to have a little something every few hours. If your body thinks that you are starving it can start to store fat for energy later on rather than burn it off.    Which brings me to exercise. Keep active, cardio is great for burning fat but if you lift weights this helps too.    15% body fat is well within a normal range for a male.    If you really want to diet speak with your family doctor. Your doctor will be familiar with your health history and should be able to help you plan a safe diet strategy.    Good luck.|`|RQRGQgk3aa	15% bodyfat is pretty solid already dude. If you are 146lbs and 5'8 then you have the same build I do. I've got about 13-14% bodyfat right now and I'm pretty cut. 6 pack abs, all that stuff.  Ditch the supplements, drink lots of milk and join your weight training class at school and the wrestling team. You'll find that you need to eat every scrap of food you can see just to avoid wasting away. And you'll come out of it as a solid block of muscle with almost infinite cardio.

P24bO1xVaa	Speed roping is an INCREDIBLY intensive workout. Unless you're in really good shape, you would be better off with a regular rope- You will be able to use it at a slower pace.         If you are working out inside, then a leather rope would be your best bet- it's a little heavier than plastic or nylon, so its easier to keep a steady rhythm. If you'll be jumping outside, a beaded rope will last longer.     For the best quality, look for boxing brands like Everlast. Also, if you play badminton, you should take a look at ropes with weighted handles. They will increase wrist and forearm strength and improve your game.
qyATAaeXaa	On very steep trails the grooming machines start at the top of the slope and groom downhill using the plow to brake on the way down.|`|OrG2fBbKaa	In addition to going up and down the slopes, some use winches to help the traction. It is more efficient to go the long way on a slope, not across.|`|OiAl6w48aa	The same way as any other runs are groomed: by snow cats.  The cats are actually an extremely stable machine - essentially they are a small cockpit and engine sitting on a very wide platform - two tracks run on either side of the cat the way a tank's do (except the snow cat's tracks have metal ridges to bite into the snow).  The tracks stick out several feet past the engine and cockpit in each direction.    Plus, they groom bottom to top / top to bottom - not sideways across the run.  Even if they did, you would have to tip a snow cat pretty much to 90 degrees or past in any direction to get it to tip over.  So short of a completely vertical section, there's no danger in it ever falling over.|`|t3rmVomeaa	Well, alot of those runs simple are not groomed.  Thats when you get moguls forming.  Check the grooming report of a major resort and you will see that most of the expert terrain is not groomed very often.      And by the way, if you try to take a snowcat across a steep aspect instead of up and down, those ridges on the tracks turn into ice skates, and the cat could slide all the way down the hill sideways...not a good situation, even though it is unlikely to roll over.  Thats why when you are skiing on groomed trails, the corduroy never runs across the hill.|`|YSUggYcAaa	If you've got a really steep & narrow pitch, sometimes you can sucker people into boot packing it.  Then you don't even need a cat!  Just people who aren't that bright!

xOReEw6Waa	One of the best cartridge information source is a reloading manual. Barnes has a very good reloading manual that explains how the cartridge developed or pertinent information on it. They also have a graphic with the loading information on what type animals that cartridge/bullet combination is good for. I think it was "Field and Stream", maybe one of the other magazines did a story on what cartridge range were good for which type hunting too. As you probably know, the caliber is the named projectile diameter, but it isn't always right on the money because each manufacturer has a different marketing plan. The 6mm Remington is the same caliber as the 243 Winchester as the 240 Weatherby Mag because they all use a .243 bullet.

It's hard to say what temperatures that would work for because there are a lot of other factors such as the shell material and the type of insulation that affect the warmth of the glove.

There aren't any charts or rating systems like there are for sleeping bags, you just buy something that looks warm.

How funny.|`|xlyk63xRaa	im a liverpool supporter, but right now im laughing at my own team, because im quite embaressed with them.|`|73716295b3b0e40388513ce9e2022b0faa	No thats newcastle and spurs matey.
BZ5z5pXqaa	either the Dodgers..because Torre took that team far last year...or the Yankees...Steinbrenner is up to his usual buying a pennant which other teams cant afford to do|`|2wAPwZ1kaa	Cubs beat Halos in 6|`|1TJuKNQvaa	The Dodgers of course why did you even have to ask.They'll make the playoffs with a full head of steam with hopefully a healthy Furcal because in the beginning of last year when he was healthy he was raking the ball, and the Dodgers were playing great plus if they add Manny they'll have a consistent club.|`|iTtMQud1aa	who knows with all the free agency that does equal out the teams my guess as of now i go Dodgers|`|jKOB7n35aa	MLB National Champs? Is Major League Baseball now in college or something? The WORLD CHAMPIONS I think will be the Red Sox since they have a great lineup, great pitching, and great management.|`|XeNGmDHvaa	cubs will do it new owners a great coach a great lineup and pitching we r doing it this year.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	I'm assuming you're talking about the World Series champs for this year? If yes, I think the Yankees could finally end the 9 yr drought this year and win. They acquired 3 key players (Sabathia, Teixeira and Burnett) this offseason and on paper have one of the best rotations in the league. Not to mention, they have one of the best bullpens this year (7th best out of 30 last year). With Wang, Posada and Matsui scheduled to be back by Opening Day, I think this is the year that the Yankees win it all.|`|NbVZafc8aa	Dodgers|`|6ExGOj6Haa	astros|`|dQ0wIYWfaa	08 champs repeat|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	mets|`|M0eyMvqlaa	I told people that the Rockies were going to win the NL West, and I stand by that prediction.    But if you're talking about the "National League" in general, I'm going with my team, the Mets.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Chicago Cubs - yeah I know, but I can still dream|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Who knows?? You never know until the last 15-20 game of the season. Oh, by the way I hope it's the Cubs!!|`|PJF4J3iYaa	there are 3 serious contenders already just because of offseason spending (yankees, mets, cubs). but i dont think any of those teams will win the World Series. look for the red sox, yankees, indians, and rangers/athletics in the AL to make the playoffs. in the NL look for the cubs, mets, diamondbacks/dodgers (if re-sign manny), and the marlins.  i'd be surprised to see the rockies be above a .500 team, my pick to win it all (if the playoffs were today) would be the yankees, but alot of things go into deciding factors: who is playing well and matchups. so it will be a team that has 3 quality starters, a good bullpen, and a potent lineup...its all about execution, my pick: ARIZONA DIAMONDBACKS  btw, no bias here, im a cardinals fan|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	San Francisco Giants if they get Manny
vFj2GMP4aa	Honestly I don't think there's an even swap for Messi right now.     Before I get crucified let me explain:  Messi can go to any team and make them better. Not any player can make Bar?a's current team go like Messi.|`|mK06dus9aa	lol @ man u - park, flethcher, nani     Barca short changed by about 50m|`|FswyqTjYaa	I wouldnt swap him, but if I had to, Ronaldo (Man Ud) would be my choice
rJMZdp04aa	Yes & No.    Yes - He chose a career with A LOT more Money & A LOT less Stress & Chance for Injury.      No - He left in the Prime of His Career.  He could have been "The One" to break Flair's Record.  He could've also just have been like John Cena , And do Movies AND Wrestle.    The Simple fact is - The Rock left Wrestling because he had No Passion for it anymore.  So , I guess in his Mind , he made the Right Choice.|`|NRs72Afxaa	It was his choice so I could care less. If the Rock ever wanted to return to wrestling then I would be pleased to have him back.|`|A7PkhsDJaa	No...he is a bad actor and always stars in terrible movies. he would be more of a legend if he was still in the WWE, plus he was a great wrestler. he should have stayed.|`|TANToYsnaa	he should of stuck to wrestling  cuz he was the best wrestler ever  he sucks at acting|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Yes, because at the time, when he first left to do his first movie in 2002 after his feud with Brock Lesnar, he was getting somewhat stale. If Rock stayed  in wrestling, people of today would not like him because they'd be quite tired of him, I suspect.     Besides, why would you wanna risk youd body 5 nights a week when you could make more money to provide for yourself by acting? You take alot less abuse.|`|l6g3moiEaa	As of right now this very moment? As a fan, I'd have to say no. Sure, getting out of the game while he was still in one piece and had no major injuries was a smart move, but we can't exactly say he left for the vaunted bigger and better thing. At that time, he was primed to be the biggest thing in Hollywood since Schwarzenegger. If his agent finally nails him an awesome script, something huge of the caliber of a summer blockbuster, I can say, "you know... The Rock was a friggin genius to leave the WWE." Still hoping that day comes.|`|5DAIonR2aa	yes,  cuz he got out b4 they messed up his good looks!
1yx9SF01aa	HE'S A RAPIST|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	I don't love him, just admire him as one of our best players..|`|IlDD3qumaa	His a matchwinner.|`|InCpu9Vfaa	legend in the making|`|Exbqy1N2aa	I don't love him because he's a rapist.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	i love him because he gives his all.|`|5YKMYcxWaa	simply cause hes good, and hes carrying arsenal at the moment with no fabregas|`|QFO2URi1aa	One of Arsenal's few great players..|`|efGx6z3vaa	he is the new Flying Dutchman of Arsenal, great player|`|svU3xeotaa	his right foot is as good as his left lol, his quick and 13 goals already good for him
cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	i said that for man utd|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I said Milan would get within the first 4 places at the beginning of the season. I only thought we could do better once November came. But now I am kind of back to the original expectation though anything is possible in football...|`|HxET88bDaa	Not me:)|`|WS8MvKQAaa	Barca!:P|`|7Xridrxaaa	i did =[|`|7VwcvLTxaa	Well every season is our seaon and so far we're doing excellently :D|`|wrhqkEiMaa	I did.  And guess what? I was right ;)|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Right here and my team still sux|`|cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	i've been overly optimistic, winning the league is impossible, why? inconsistency. the team need to pull their strings if they need to win anything, but to be honest compared to last season i'm glad the team managed to put things behind them and start from zero, with a new and discipline-demanding coach who cooperates with everyone and gives all the players a chance, i'm more than sure this year there won't be any titles won, but starting next season things will improve, the players will be more used to the coach and his tactics, they coach would know his players very well, and with financial issues improving we might witness 1 or 2 signings which would give the whole team a boost of moral.  if the improvement continues i can be sure we can win the league in 2 years' time.|`|Yb0182Vxaa	me, well the mexican season is only 2 games in so I'll let you know later|`|VDh1fcGIaa	LOL guess you dont wanna hear my answer    *whispers in ear* Next season is ours too =P|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Well this year is definitely NOT Milan's year =[|`|WdOAxQmoaa	kinda me, i was hoping eduardo and rosicky would be fitt in time but there not.    but ahh well.|`|DMDYR6RXaa	To be honest, not me! I wasn't that optimistic with Barca's performance last season but this one I believe Real Madrid or any other club won't be able to rob us of the title ever again!
7X1H2AfWaa	Ive just answered a question like this which has the same trade. What a coincidence (sarcasm, actually its been going on for a while).|`|sOae9LUzaa	Kobe will just get pissed at Garnett for yelling and at Ray for shooting too many 3s.|`|5BQM1hTTaa	I don't want to lose Paul Pierce.  Even though Kobe is better.  That trade will never happen.  Paul is not leaving the C's.|`|9F6zgX8waa	lol yeah its pretty common even tho it would never happen|`|LtOxnF0kaa	You know I think that the celtics would be happy getting kobie but I dont think the lakers would ever trade kobie away.|`|bIV9RUpkaa	never going to happen..kobe much better player..celtics dont need kobe he too good with kg and ray allen keep paul pierce celtics..and paul not good enuf for lakers to trade kobe maybe lebron yes

Ever since his rant, Liverpool have been awful. Now he drags Gerrard off when they need a goal. He's the only man there capable of scoring a vital goal (Torres was already off) !!! Pressure has got to him, no doubt.|`|AA11076076	Lucas always fouls people, Rafa has lost the plot.  We need Gerrard and Torres on the field.  Ok Torres not fully fit but there is sod all wrong with Stevie - I don't get it|`|YrL1xSEOaa	Not the first time he choosed to selfdestruct.Its far from over though.A 3 points lead is hardly what you can call "insurpassable".|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Ha ha, you would think so!

a6EndAPiaa	Right now  1) Darren Sprles  2) Mike Sellers (NFC pro bowl full back)  The guy is a running back in an offensive lineman's body.    All time  1) Barry Sanders  2) Jim Brown|`|u7GBP579aa	adrian peterson, is a power back mixed with elusiveness. but the best elusive running back right now i would have to say chris johnson or brian westbrook, the person with most power i would say clinton portis or lendale white. THe most elusive of all time has to go to barry sanders, and the power back of all time has to go to jerome betts|`|Ky99KA8Raa	darren sproles|`|KZsdVGJzaa	ap i would say is more elusive ppl think that he's more of a power person because he's big but he almost never runs over players he seems to rather juke them then run them over.    but best all around rb (u may think i'm bein a homer but) steven jackson is in my opinion the best. he has speed, elusiveness, power, catching, blocking jus the complete package.expect big for him next year|`|Z4ApIxaeaa	Elusive - Now - Darren Sproles              - All Time - Walter Payton    Power - Now - Brandon Jacobs            - All Time - Earl Campbell    Adrian Peterson is the best back in the NFL though and best All Purpose back is Steven Jackson|`|gVjhndrQaa	*Barry Sanders.    He would have all the records, but he retired early because he was tired of his bad coaches and managers of the Detroit Lions.|`|287ryVgFaa	Elusiveness - Barry Sanders for sure  Power is a tough one b/c they usually arent the glory boys that rack up yards and instead are touchdown vultures. Jim Brown would probably head up my list though for power.    And I think All Day is a combination of both.|`|nfLd3ngraa	Adrian Peterson is a elusive back. Same with guys like L.T. , Stephen Jackson and Clinton Portis. The best back of all time and the best style has to be Barry Sanders. As far a power backs Davenport and T.J. Duckett are only power and nothing else. But today the best power back right now would probably be Bradon Jacobs. As far as ever without a doubt the best powerback of all time is Walter Payton.|`|U7ipYJ24aa	DeAngelo Williams,Michael Turner,Jin Brown are your answers|`|WGvhXXFPaa	Adrian Peterson is elusive, LT is power.|`|RrKeyYo0aa	the modern era... barry sanders or walter payton, ole skool... gale sayers.|`|1dcd89d066b147fb17782f288f89d93caa	For current players   Elusive 1) Adrian Peterson             -Darren Sproles a close second  Power  2) Brandon Jacobs             -Marion Barber a distant second  All Time  1) Barry Sanders. No if ands or buts about it. Guy is king.  2) Earl Campbell. He destroyed players. Go YouTube him.
nJ5kceMBaa	I'd say it was 10% squad, 90% Benitez. There are a few areas to improve (LB, RB, RM), and we could really do with a good striker to partner with Torres, but Benitez has to take the majority of the blame for his beyond-cautious tactics and odd decisions. They have been a direct cause of us dropping points many times this season.|`|duJgBxUoaa	Rafa Benitez is wrong with Liverpool.|`|IlDD3qumaa	I'd says its benitez,His transfer policy and his tactics.|`|oNR7il8baa	Well a couple of weeks ago they were saying how great Rafa was.   And a coach alone doesn't make the team bad.     It's both the team and Rafa's fault.|`|xiDeae1saa	i guess we're just not good enough|`|oWvERPukaa	The problem is Benitez. I think he is really hurting Liverpool with his team selections and subs. Why he continues to play Lucas is a mystery. Plus, whenever we draw or lose, he always blames the opposition, the refree, the linesman etc........
9abe3ec152663d9618feaad728c0b3a7aa	Yeah, it is a great show did you see a preview for next weeks ep. with Vince Mcmahon asking him if he is finished?

20781cd6d818cd30c7a57e606199faafaa	Mount won 26 straight state titles. That run ended in 2004, when they lost in the finals to Toll Gate. Mount has produced a handful of NHL players. Mount St. Charles' history is chronicled in a 2006 documentary "Ice Kings". Worth watching
M0eyMvqlaa	Smartest question you ever asked X, because It actually makes sense.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Well that might help the economy but, I guess we can't do anything about it..|`|gVYfFSpRaa	About half of them do.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	Why don't YOU go out and find a job instead of comming in here 247 and posting stupid questions,and donate some of your money.  You waste of human flesh|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	because they r not stupid like u|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	well this is kobe's salary for a year $21,262,500. So why don't the basketball players donate money...football? I'm not disagreeing with you because the NYY have a ridiculous payroll. But don't point the finger at baseball and don't bring hockey players into it because they have the lowest salaries of the three.|`|Cr0wCMzlaa	First of all, baseball isn`t boring. If your a real fan you would know this  !  I suppose you like soccer (talk about boring).     Why should ball players of any sport give there money away ?  Remember that they are getting paid by an owner with alot more money than the players have.     Plus , some of these poor people your talking about probably wont even help themselves, why should someone else.|`|VY8AP6PHaa	actually i like/agree with this question, minus the boring part. there are lots of sports celebrities making more than their fair share, especially in this economy.|`|TCehI17kaa	Pissing off my contacts again jackass?|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Last time I checked players of all 4 major sports donated large amounts to charities and even run charities of their own.  I know players of good baseball (you know, like players in the MLB) make lots of money and donate lots of money.  I don't know how much players of boring baseball make, but it probably isn't much since I don't think a boring game would draw many people, especially when fans could go to an mlb game.|`|5yZICXImaa	This is actually the most legit question you have asked. Baseball players do it because they feel they make a lot of money and have too much so they decide to do something nice and give it away. A lot of baseball players do it and it is the right choice.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Most players do donate money as well as other athletes in football, basketball, NASCAR & hockey.  What have you done to help the economy?  Did you donate?|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Why dont you donate your body to science

The best...possibly alexander ovechkin or pavel datsyuk but i would go with datsyuk. Steve Stamkos is also a very good young player.|`|5e9a91b256ff250214a47b65c81c64f5aa	Well Devin Setoguchi, Luke Schenn, and Erik Ersberg are all great rookies/sophmores.|`|eysDi4rIaa	No one in the NHL is as good as what Lebron does in the NBA but the closest player is Alexander Ovechkin.|`|5009f311a98149b8d3af6bbdd5543e9aaa	Top 3 of NHL best players at this moment are:    1- Evgeny Malkin (Pittsburgh)  2- Sidney Crosby (Pittsburgh)  3- Alexander Ovechkin (Washington)|`|8u0dwclAaa	it dosent make any sence.  Lebron James playes basketball.  NBA and NHL is 2 different thing.|`|bF9s0LwRaa	It's a tossup who is the best player right now.

I dunno who would compare to Lebron. As for Tavares he is a stud and will be in the NHL next year.|`|DvBPLP4saa	I've heard some people call John Tavares the "Lebron James of hockey" a couple of times.   Here's a little article that says it.  http://blog.mlive.com/flintjournal/its_j...      BUT....John Tavares is NOT in the NHL yet. He'll be drafted by a NHL team in June. He is expected right now to go first overall.    The best young player in the NHL? There's is no best.....there's just a talented bunch in Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin, Patrick Kane, Evgeni Malkin and others.

The whole point of playing 4-2-3-1 is that it suits our best players, but if you're not going to play our best players, don't bother playing 4-2-3-1.

ImHvd8F0aa	The 1919 White Sox were an excellent team. The players did not appreciate how Charley Comiskey treated them.Compared to the rest of baseball, their salaries were embarrassing.    Two hall of famers were on the team, Eddie Collins and Ray Schalk. Two should be in the HOF were there, Joe Jackson and Buck Weaver.    This team could have beaten the Reds with their eyes closed, but with Felsch, Risberg, Cicotte, Williams and Gandil as the ring leader, it didn't happen.|`|TCehI17kaa	While it could be a possibility it will always be tarnished by the Black Sox Scandal.|`|sVPjp3dUaa	I don't know what you've been reading, but I have never, EVER heard or read anyone say that the '19 Black Sox are were the best team. There are many teams well ahead of them in line for that honor. And to the guy who said the '98 Yanks...get real! No team from the last 20 yrs or so should even be considered for the 'title' of best team ever. ESPECIALLY the Yanks!|`|FYBUbRmTaa	Hmm...well I think it is very hard to lable any one team as the best team ever because there have been so many great teams. I agree that was a good team ....talent wise. In my opinion however "the best team" should have won the world series. I know that they choose not to do well and not win, but essentially in the end they didn't get it done. I think a good team consists of more than just talent. It has character. I fail to see the 1919 White Sox even as the best White Sox team. I put a great value on character and I feel like 2005's White Sox team had the most of that.     But of course solely looking at talent the 1919 White Sox would be up top the best team list.|`|1TJuKNQvaa	The best team is probably the 1927 New York Yankees.  Reason why I think this:Babe Ruth & Lou Gehrig on the same team.|`|4e5b4896d3758b051623a078b2e188f8aa	You're the only person I've ever heard mention them as being the greatest team of all time.    As Chipmaker said, I'd also like to see a citation.|`|at9oXcvEaa	Many experts would say that the 1927 Yankees were a superb team. With a lineup that included Gehrig, Ruth, Lazzeri, Combes and Meusel and five guys over .300 and four of them at least at.337. Also, Ruth had 60 HRs and Gehrig added 47. Not to mention their pitching staff which posted a 3.20 ERA and included Hall of Famer Waite Hoyt. They won the World Series and had the MVP on their team. How can you argue with that team? They must have been fun to watch!!|`|gwUq6HMUaa	No, they probably just say that because, they got so much attention on the scandal in the World Series.|`|rAfd1pcqaa	who cares? baseball is boring.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	how would you figure?  most of them got banned because the either accepted or allegedly accepted money to throw the game, sounds like a dirty team to me|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Really?    I must ask for citations to published materials that reach that conclusion.    ----------  Fair enough. Holtzman has the upper hand here, since he does not have to defend his words (one advantage of being dead). Ah well; it would have been nice to know exactly which historians he was thinking of when he wrote that passage -- because while the 1919 White Sox were very, very good (notwithstanding some of the roster not trying to win some of the games in October), I cannot see any reliable way one, let alone a significant plurality, of historians, could rank it the best team of all time.    Perhaps, however, it was late one night and Holtzman's circle of drinking buddies had been deeply into their cups, and the notion sounded good enough to buy another round and raise a toast to it.|`|zFlfIOQwaa	hell no! Murderers Row was! i beleive it was the 1927 OR 1923 Yankees lineup. Look it up on google,then look at each players stats. Then you tell me who was better!|`|rROyFAMFaa	the white sox rox, yes im from chicago, but the best team by far in all of baseball would be the 27 yankees, how could u argue with their greatness, the best or one of the best baseball players ever played in the 27 yankees ( The Sultan of Slam aka Babe Ruth|`|urmhRHwxaa	I thought it was supposed to be either the 1955 Brooklyn Dodgers or the 1927 Yankees.    The 1919 "Black Sox" are famous due to the World Series scandal, so perhaps that is what has elevated their reputation.|`|zdQgOzYXaa	I watched about 40 of their games in person, but they were no where as good as the 1898 team.|`|Ekl2RApOaa	I think the 1927 Yankees and 1955 Dodgers and 1998 Yankees are better teams.|`|42a808600b09bd222d75e11f7e961238aa	They were a great team but they weren't the best. I would have to say that the 98 Yankees were the best of all time. Their record was 114-48 and they won the series in a rout.  Top stars Bernie Williams and Derek Jeter didn't quite evoke comparisons to Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, but they headlined the Bronx Bombers' deepest and most resourceful team ever. Under their calm-but-intense manager, Joe Torre, the Yanks steamrolled through the league with a quiet efficiency. Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez drove in 116 and 123 runs, respectively, while pitchers David Wells, David Cone and Orlando Hernandez went a combined 50-15.
uXXbegw5aa	Sammy Lee was better ;)  Rafa will be in hospital for more than kidney stones....|`|RSJbqioUaa	HAHAHAHAHAHA!!  I'm having a great time tonight :)|`|t4UrqK4Raa	If you want to give somebody kidney stones you have to pee in their soup.|`|uUitKmJMaa	lol i ll give him more than just kidney stones..! Grr|`|cjNtjOZtaa	And they say I was harsh on my clubs manager .|`|duJgBxUoaa	A Rock seems a better choice than Rafa atm.
ST6O0oXsaa	Richard Jefferson cause he can take over games.   Lewis just has momentum changing plays and tends to settle for 3's too much. Lewis can be a really good player when he drives.|`|VDKVy4A3aa	Richard Jefferson. He was a great addition to the NJ Nets a few years back. RJ was one of the all time top scorers of the Nets, and right now he is doing a great job for the Bucks. The bucks should get an 8th playoff  spot of Jefferson continues his good play.|`|j29eHSDqaa	Both are similar players, but Rashad Lewis is a better shooter than Jefferson.              --------------------------------------...|`|7859db4349d703a0c747d4e81276b851aa	Rashard Lewis.|`|i9FLcvb7aa	KRS is better than PAC!!!!!|`|UMVWQiYJaa	Lewis fosho|`|EsnFmcMFaa	ima go with lewis  only because hes a better scorer  but RJ plays better defense|`|GBGcI509aa	I agree with Luc S.|`|mff1vstNaa	I say Lewis. He's a more versatile forward like Marion and he's got better percentages from the 3. Since he's taller, he's a better rebounder. Jefferson is more athletic and has more balanced offense. He takes more mid range shots than Lewis. .|`|AJEDjzC1aa	Rashad Lewis

AA10304847	The Cards have several edges in this game, not only was Whisenhunt the Steelers tight end coach from 2001-2003 and offensive coordinator from 2004-2006, but Russ Grimm was the Steeler assistant head coach/offensive line coach, Mike Miller the receivers coach , Matt Raich a defensive assistant and Kevin Spencer the Special Teams coach. Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The "us against the world" mentality is the other big edge for the CARDS, used to win the last 3 playoff games.....|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	the Cards beat them last year and if I remember, it was IN Pittsburgh.  People giving the Cardinals no chance apparently didnt watch that game.|`|SZ7NLb05aa	well....cardinals have fitzgerald, which is the steelers biggest threat..but first, steelers have the BEST defence in the whole league, so they can put double coverage up on him with troy, and then the other side, the DB's on the steelers are good enuff.     and then steelers offence: hines ward, santonio holmes, and nate washington...cardinals dont have MUCH of an advantage, AND ben might've changed, and the steelers will probably do some counter-thing with thin|`|fawhiGtsaa	No.|`|Bgpk4npBaa	if you played yout brother everyday in football then when you grew up and played professionally would it really matter if you new his weaknesses? i dont think so b ecause on any givin sunday anything can happen i dont think things like that really matter if anything Pitts gotta advantage knowing Whisenhunt  THINKS he knows what their   D-fence is gonna do but then all they got do is swich things up....|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Not as much as the Steelers do in going for  2 in 4 years...while the Cardinals haven't won it all since 1947...|`|kV53Roz1aa	I'm a huge Steelers fan and I've been wondering about the Whisenhunt/Grimm connection.  But I've come to the conclusion that Dick Lebeau probably has a good idea of what the Cards will throw at 'em so I'm not worried.    Oh, and who cares if the Card's beat them in Pitt last year.  You're really going to think they'll win the Super Bowl because of that?|`|nfCH7nkTaa	it will definately make the game much more interesting, and don't forget about Russ Grimm, who is an ex steeler coach|`|WGvhXXFPaa	Maybe. It depends if he knows how to use that knowledge to his advantage.|`|kTbCarenaa	yes, their names are kurt warner and larry fitzgerald|`|TlQW67MFaa	hmm maybe. they might have a slight advantage. but it looks pretty fair to me.|`|SSrsxhllaa	Maybe a little. They still have to play. I think the Steelers with the  1 Defense will win. Baltimore knows the Steelers very well and they lost 3 times this year!  Edit. Make excuses for Baltimore all you want. Baltimore was good. Steelers are just better. Like I said  1 Defense!
SZ7NLb05aa	idk, he was pretty amazing as a QB.   i mean a lot of teams will probably be willing to take him back.  like vick only got in trouble for dog fighting, and that's not really an addiction like heroine. it's like carrying a gun. they can stop doing it, he leanred the lesson. he'll never do it again, so i dont think other teams will have trouble with him. ALSO..  pacman jones gets away with sooo much shizz.|`|Fl4b4Yd4aa	I hear 49ers but if he cant run like he use to he might not be so explosive cause then he'd have to learn how to throw the ball|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	i sure hope he stays out of Detroit...that's the last thing we need. But i can see him ending up in oakland because they seem to be the NFL's garbage can|`|nltFZcuGaa	i think there is some REAL talk about him going to the bears. i know that because i live in chitown.|`|e8mnEw1taa	i bielive he might go to denver|`|C1Mjfx2qaa	Oakland and Detroit are possibilities. Kansas City is too conservative an area to be signing convicted felons. Seattle? They have Hasselbeck, who is only in his early 30's. You just didn't hear much of him this year because of injuries.|`|KWQokwaJaa	I think it's time for a new  7 jersey on the MN Vikings. Tavaris Jackson, nor Gus is going to do anything in the long run. Why not gamble?|`|tWUQU4Juaa	I hope that he doesn't play for anyone . He is the scum of the earth , nothing but a piece of sh*t .|`|KS2v0T4Kaa	Vick won't come back this year and if he did no one would want him because all of the fans would hate him, and rightly so!|`|4kdlE54Paa	I am not familiar with the Canadian league teams to answer that question.    He will be suspended after his release and you also have to consider the PR nightmare the team that picks him up will have to go through.  There is more negative than positive picking up Vick.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|4GCH1lTyaa	the Canadian league|`|TgU9P6pdaa	I'd hope that no team would be stupid enough to pick him.  Besides the fact that he hasnt been playing since he's been in prison, he doesn't deserve a second chance.|`|Z03zgM0maa	Minnesota? Him and peterson would be awesome|`|DjjCvjlnaa	Only the Cowboys would be stupid enough to pick him up.
AA11016927	Duke is on the right track, (thumbs up).    Out of the 195 worms you get maybe 50 of them are usable for any serious fishing, and 30 would be considered "Good" soft plastic's.     As much as I like Cabelas,  they have to get rid of unwanted stock like any other company.|`|KJWxqQHiaa	I agree w/ Duke & Fisher King, i would give 'em a thumbs up but, since this is my newest YA! profile, I'm only on level 1 =(. Even though it's a huge bargain, i wouldn't get them. You (well, i) would not fish with them because i would be like "Not today, I'm unsure they work, get that bag of culprit's!" That's why you shouldn't buy gimmick lures either! Wasting money, when you have better baits out there. I have read the reviews also, and seen the product and wanted it too, but i just can't do it. The worms are probably between 4-6 inches, no longer also. Hey, if you want a real, good deal on soft plastics, head to wal-mart and buy renegade brand plastic worms. FLW worms are also good, and there's a 20 pack for $1.50. Best deal I've had in a long time. I'm not a big fan of tube-baits, they tore the hell out of my rooster-tails!!! Especially the cheap tubes which are as sticky as warm maple syrup. I have too many problems with cheap ones, way too many. Tear the damn skirt off every lure i had! But, i had an over-stuffed tackle box!|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	I agree with everyone else...I can tell you from my experience...I only use certain types and colors of worms throughout the year...for example, I use the Zoom Finesse Worm about 85% of the year (colors are Marti Gra, Green Pumpkin Green Flake, Green Pumpkin Purple and Gold Flake, Watermelon Seed, and sometime Green Pumpkin and Green Pumpkin Red Flake and June Bug) I usually only use Junebug during the summer...the rest of the year I use a Trick Worm, or a U-Tail Worm or an Ol Monster Worm...depending on if I am using a Shaky Head, Carolina Rig or Texas Rig...in the Colors above...I do have other colors, but I use these 95% of the time...I have several Wal Mart Bags full of worms I don't use....my wife actually made me go through my thousands of dollars of worms and separate them by season so my tackle bag is not as heavy (I fish as a Non-Boater in my club) For my money Zoom makes the best worm...that is all I have except of a few bags of Yamamoto Senkos...I guess I rambled enough...I hope they are biting this weekend...but it is going to be cold to cool...|`|d29M7lGKaa	I would stick with the worms that work good for me, I have a lot of worms in my box that I never use, It's better to buy the one that work !!!!|`|SArRAmYHaa	You will never use all those worms. You will put it in your garage with the rest of your fishing stuff you bought as a " good deal". You will continue to use the few things that work for you time and time again. Trust me, I have about 5 tackle boxes full of stuff i "needed" at the store but never use now!!. Only upside is this is good if you are going to share it with a bunch of friends/family etc who are fishermen.
6nY99hPmaa	i know what you mean about the underwear thing lol he needs to go back to wearing he's pants.     and about the shape he's in , to be honest y2j was only really cut in the med 2000 to 2002. he looks about the same as always to me now.|`|4V6V9uN8aa	For whatever reasons, most of the wrestlers go through this stage.  When they come back from an injury or from being off for a moment, they come back ripped & cut or bigger & leaner.  But, from the schedule these guys have to keep & eating habits not always being the best, some of them put on punds that take away from their physiques.  For example, look at Cena before the injury, then how he looked at the Rumble last year & how he looks now.  Same with Kingston, Morrison, & more.  Some of the guys like HBK, Mysterio, & others have ways of keeping the fat off of them.. HBK leads a very clean lifestyle & keeps a rigorous diet, thus he keeps his physique & wrestles with alot more stamina than most other wrestlers.  Big Show has begun dieting heavily & it has shown in his look & his movements around the ring.  You have to remember that hitting the gym between shows is almost non-existent & most of the stars have to grab what they can to eat, where they can while on the road.|`|Vbfq5YUTaa	Tights not Pants|`|SOuezSW2aa	i dont wohsidtkmsdg|`|232SYfGHaa	I agree, he is fat now and his underwear is so messed up. He was a 1000 time better in the begining of 2008.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	He doesn't look fat at all|`|Y93pUmAGaa	...noting mr.mcmahon gave him his job back  a week ago|`|IMQm9JTMaa	LOL, that's what the holidays will do to you.    I liked his pants better though.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I noticed that Matt was getting a bit of a tummy (like I can talk LOL) but I thought it might have been because he wasn't do so much of the high flying stuff; and since he was champ maybe he was concentrating more on power stuff than risky stuff.  As for Y2J, I think the undies thing is part of a new loomk to go with the new attitude? They do look un Y2Jish, but maybe he had a pay cut and couldn't afford material to cover his legs as well?  It may just be one of those "seemed like a good idea at the time" things...like when HBK cut his hair short LOL|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Y2J isn't that fat.  The trunks are to symbolize that he isn't the same Y2J from back in the early 00's.|`|l6g3moiEaa	You didn't know? The underwear symbolizes that you've gone and turned heel! When he breaks out the pants again, you'll know he's a face. No, but seriously, it's to show we, the unappreciative fans, that he's not the same Y2J who cared about our approval back in the good ol' days.|`|3jmLx5wzaa	There is one thing you can say about Chris Jericho: The guy sure knows how to make an entrance. His WWE debut in 1999 as the man behind the mysterious Y2J millennium countdown was one of the most memorable moments in WWE history. But Jericho outdid himself in his second coming as the answer to a series of code-encrypted video eight years later. The man who will Save_US all is back after a two-year hiatus, and our fans couldnt be happier. Whether he's been beloved or hated by WWE fans, Jericho has never been at a loss for words. And Y2J has backed up every single word he said in his storied career, winning a laundry list of championships and going down in history as the first ever Undisputed WWE Champion. The son of former National Hockey League player Ted Irvine, Jericho was born in Manhasset, N.Y. but was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba in Canada. He trained in Stu Harts famed dungeon and made his pro wrestling debut at age 19 in 1990. Jericho wrestled around the world and infused different styles he learned in Canada, Mexico and Japan into his own repertoire. He slowly built a following what would become loyal Jerichoholics before appearing in ECW (where he briefly held the ECW TV Championship) and then landing in WCW in 1996.|`|2uaG87rFaa	he is a fat and tubby boy

One thing though, it never affected Naka and Crosas who were on a different level from anyone else on the pitch. Great performance from both of them. SFA say they have no plans to change it but might review things in March. Will be a joke if that's not changed. Just another joke at a laughable stadium.|`|lKdLsRPDaa	I've seen better looking minefields in Iraq, than this surface.|`|23533728e2015c47fbaedd308257bf8aaa	It was the same last night,it is a total disgrace.    get a grip SFA|`|BdiQPKn0aa	It's a complete disgrace|`|bzwSCm6taa	agree the pitch is a disgrace....get it sorted....|`|euZRbiA2aa	Aye blame the pitch.

You aren't showing your teammates that you have good confidence in them. Even if you don't you must fake at least that you trust them and stay positive. After this your team chemistry should be great.|`|EWyo1nmBaa	Just take a deep breath and forget that it ever happened. Try to encourage them and lift their spirits.     Also, don't try to think so competitively. Just go out there on the court and have some fun. It'll help you take your mind off of your anger.

XenkWmShaa	Flip a coin|`|a19Z5rwLaa	How big are you?  Those two positions are completely different.  Guards are much larger, power burst of speed people.  Safeties typical are much smaller and quick.    Sure your heart matters but so does the body you were given.|`|u7GBP579aa	whoa! that is a big difference, it all depends on your size. If you are a bigger guy i would say left guard if you want to be a free saftey you have to be quick with your feet, good vision, and you have got to be able to level your body, square up, and light someone up. Especially one on one because lots of time the saftey is the last person to have a shot a hitting someone. A left guard has to be good with his hands and feet. ALso like i said before it depends on big you are.|`|2vSxgAkDaa	answer this plz urgent:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/indexq...|`|knsbKlezaa	It all depends on what you like but I would say 100% free safety. The best feeling in football is getting an interception off the QB. Safetys get a lot of interceptions because they usually guard an area rather than a single player. Also, LGs usually do a lot of work without ever getting noticed. Size also plays a factor so you could ask the coaches where they thought you would fit in or at what position your body size would benefit you. Plus, LGs never score!|`|C2CCbTRKaa	You should play FREE SAFETY,also ask your dad to buy you a computer,so you won,t have to hop in the truck to go to the library.Also the next time your in the library grab a SPELLING book.|`|diZoW49Zaa	If your fast and hit hard (and love to hit) and tackle well, I would go for free safety.

Federer est avant tout (et meme lui le dit haut et fort, avec humilit) un joueur de tennis.

Fnp4co7Raa	If he keeps playing that dozy tosser Lucas, then YES!    Benayoun made up for his mistake last Monday, but Lucas just made himself look a right ol' langer yet again.    Lucas has been costing us a lot of points, and yet he gets into the team ahead of Alonso. WTF Rafa! He's useless!

But sometimes it can be more disruptive to leave a team with no Manager and rush around in a week finding one for the next match. Though with that said, he really has shot his mouth off and not taken his own advice. I was gobsmacked at his decision making today. People say he is smart and a good reader of the games etc, but many of his actions and choices defy that of late. If in fact he is, what is behind his decisions and lack of sanity. No one can seriously say he is making sensible choices or has his reasons. Slipping from 1st to 3rd isn't displaying that. I know players are responsible as well, they are actually on the pitch, so they must take responsibility for their lack of drive, but a strong Manager can turn that around. Sometimes I wonder whether he has your clubs or his own best interests at heart. Only you guys can decide if you want him to stay or go. It's your club .|`|569220f4bb3c501027a6a6fe7ba2bb28aa	It's long over due.  He has to go.|`|uePD9IAXaa	Well we have had to deal with a bunch of injuries that have caused the rotation(whether it was a good policy or not) now be made out of nescessity. Torres unfortunately needs a couple more games match practice if he is even fit. Keane hasn't slotted in as he would have liked and now has fallen foul of someone. Rafa has had ill health which would be affecting his judgements. Our defence has had its ups and downs with injury. Babel hasn't come along as he looked like he would and Gerrard has been forced to carry more weight than he usually is expected which is more than most players. Plus those yanks have no idea the sooner we can **** them off the better.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Yes. I'm tired of pretending that everything's good.

Rafa didn't choose to buy Keane he wanted Barry so he benches him... Rafa had scouts look at Vidic diaby and others but the board don't listen to him... he still got you a Cl trophy ... is he crap or is the tension with the board unsettling him? I know who I would back out of the two.|`|JdlkhEayaa	OK, Rafa does get on my nerves with his ridiculous team selections...which most Liverpool supporters don't understand, and his insistence of playing that eejit Lucas, but all I want from LFC is results, results, results, and we aren't getting them with Rafa just now.  The thing is....if he was to go....who the hell could do a better job?  Possibly Martin O'Neil but apart from him WHO?  I can't think of anybody.|`|oNR7il8baa	He leaves now it could show to be even worse for Liverpool if they don't get a good coach in time.

His performance as manager was rubbish today. Rafa has failed us and needs to get his bags packing quick. ( but after the season is over and we win the premiership + Champions league )|`|58HL86ATaa	if he thinks that lucus is a better option than alonso then yes its time to go|`|mK06dus9aa	He's ..... not good. Maybe the brave thing to do is cut him now.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Kate you have to look at the board as well , he did not want Keane - he wanted Barry - you never got him - but his rotation policy does not help .|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Honestly just because he's made some mistakes doesn't mean he hasn't made great decsions in the past years. You people can't just say that a manager should go just because he made some mistakes. Like Chelsea, Scolari is an awesome coach/manager he shouldn't leave because he caused some loses. It's insane Rafa started off great he put Liverpool at top for a pretty long time, and now just because he caused some loses/draws you guys want him to leave? What more do you guys want? What if they replace Rafa with a horrible manager..what will you say then?|`|7Xridrxaaa	I told you Kate haha but you thought i was taking shots at your team :p haha Rafa must go!!

ce59136458a31504821dad8487457fefaa	C'est un problme rcurant pour les clubs fran?ais... J'ai dj pos une question similaire dans la catgorie rugby  J'espere que tu ne regardes pas le match de cet aprmidi car l'arbitre est encore partial.... Heureusement que les anglais sont moins forts...   ;-)|`|b26c82d043b55f6424229ddaaa2aa688aa	ils ont eu de la chance ... un point c'est tout .... Pour ta question sur l'arbitrage ... eh bien dans le rubgy il n'y a pas de triche .... parfois c'est trs difficile d'tre trs impartial ... cet arbitre Irlandais m'a paru assez correct ....|`|P1feOy5Naa	je dirai juste que l arbitrage et devenu professionnel et que les arbitre soi disent (pro) son de plus en plus nul alors je pose la question suivant c de la faut des arbitre ou de leur formation|`|D7OFstJzaa	Il y a probablement un problme de favoritisme des clubs anglo saxons par les arbitres anglo saxons, mme si je pense que c'est moins net qu'avant.  En revanche la fa?on de jouer des "latin" et des "anglais" peut varier, et ainsi l'apprciation des rgles par l'arbitre varie probablement d'un pays  l'autre; il peut tre alors + ou - permissif sur certaines actions. Les fran?ais, habitus  tre arbitrs par des fran?ais doivent donc s'adapter  cet tat de fait. Lorsqu'un match est arbitr par un fran?ais, il ne peut  mon sens pas y avoir de problme d'interprtation du jeu et de la rgle, puisqu'il arbitre 2 quipes anglo-saxonnes, qui pratiquent donc le "mme" jeu, et sont donc sanctionnes de la mme fa?on.  Pour finir, il est  noter que les arbitres anglais ne supportent pas qu'on leur parle ou qu'on conteste leurs dcisions; ils auront alors tendance  sanctionner ceux qui les emmerdent le +; et comme la spcialit fran?aise est de raler...enfin, ?a change depuis quelques annes!!|`|5736fbd317076b38e4807f58d3afa797aa	Tout simplement que l'arbitre n'a pas sorti un joueur anglais car il n'a pas voulu pnalis le match, et les fautes n'taient pas assez importantes pour lui.|`|41e9f644d08afeb6ec42d142a9f378d3aa	Ils ont eu beaucoup de chance|`|ba795d1b149e1a32f9f4386b6d054bedaa	Ca me rappelle un dessin de blachon : on voit un rugbyman allonge sur un divan qui parle  son psy. il lui dit : toutes les nuits je reve que j'etrangle l'arbitre. son psy lui repond : si c'est un britanique c'est normal.

7Mt2F3G4aa	Parfois on croit rver!!!  La boxe est un art... n'importe quoi!!! L'expression "noble art" vient de loin, de l'poque o les boxeurs avaient la "noblesse" de respecter leur adversaire, un esprit chevaleresque ou gagner ne signifiait pas humilier...  La boxe n'est pas la guerre... c'est ou du moins c'tait, un sport, un sport de combat certes, mais ni plus ni moins qu'un sport, ou le champion tait vraiment le meilleur!  Depuis le fric est intervenu, la boxe est devenue un business, un spectacle avec des maquereaux (managers et promoteurs) et des putains (boxeurs) qu'ont jette quand ils ne ramenent plus assez de pognon.  Il ne suffit plus d'tre le plus fort pour tre le champion, il faut aussi tre bien entour et accepter de baisser son froc, et d'ailleurs que veut dire champion quand il y en a 4 par catgorie???  Le fric a tu la boxe, et les Acaries ont leur part de responsabilit, tout comme Don King, Bob Arum et bien d'autres... Le fric est en train de tuer tous les sports...  Les matchs ou combats achets deviennent de plus en plus courants, et je ne vous parle mme pas du dopage et autres subversions!!!  Je garde le plus profond respect pour les boxeurs, car s'ils ne pratiquent pas le plus "dur des arts", pratiquent le plus "dur des sports" ou entrainement et mental font effectivement partie de la panoplie des vrais champions, mais je crache sur tous ceux qui sous pretexte de faire "revivre" la boxe en font une parodie d'une tristesse affigeante...|`|5f96a504cd015541262ec322271e38afaa	L o je comprends encore moins, c'est que Brahim Asloum est mari  une fille Acaris!!!!|`|72414fd8359eb5ba2537ce5c80b6b918aa	ce sont des businessmen.....il n'ont jamais de champion du monde......si tu veux flinguer ta carrire.....vas chez acaries....champion de France (d'europe des fois)....oui....mais aprs on ferme  !!|`|3c00fe170901c5cc65f8ca631e300c06aa	Je ne sais pas si c'est la resultat du coaching des freres acaries ou bien la mentalite d'Asloum, mais bon vu la tete de ses 2 derniers combats, on a l'impression qu'il est rest dans le giron "amateur" et qu'il a pas encore vraiment integr le monde pro: on dirait qu'il boxe encore aux points et non pour foutre la racle a son adversaire ...|`|cb8bfe9cd3a1b13e11bbd38f74b7a415aa	la boxe est un sport rgi par les intermdiaires multiples (promoteurs, agents, mdias), donc par l'argent. il n'y a pas vraiment des cadres fixes et d'organisation relle. A partir de la tout est permi pourvu qu'on rentabilise le spectacle. Asloum tait une sorte de poules aux d'or faite pour amuser la galerie depuis Sydney 2000. Une plus aprs les Tyson, Joe Louis, Liston aux fins de carrires pathtiques.     La boxe amateur qui ne draine pas autant de revenus, ressemble plus  un sport organis comme les autres avec des comptions et des tableau (premier tour, quart des final, demi finale, finale).|`|4ededeb68fbaf5f0746578ba66e1e06aaa	Certe, les acaries sont pas des dieux, mais Hasloum est bien gentil mais c'est tout...  Il a tourn contre des limites tocard jusqu'a present, il a pas la rage, il a pas la vista du vice et encore moins le punch..    Pour faire un bon tueur, parceque le ring c'est la guerre, il faut plus , beaucoup plus que ca.. C'est pas Acaries qui boxe, c 'est Hasloum!! alors arretez de dire n'importe quoi, etre un tueur sur le ring n'est pas donn a tous, et encore moins au boxeur Francais, le seul qui a ce qui faut pour arriver au nirvana du noble art c'est Mormeck lui a la vista,   et la rage...|`|hchmn1Wwaa	Asloum est un branleur qui est passer de la boxe au showbiz et a la coke !! et maintenant il pleure car il n as plus le niveau , c est malheureux quand mme !! il n y a que deux rgles pour le noble art : l entra?nement assidue et le MENTAL de guerrier !
brERqcQEaa	go play at a local indor club. take lessons.
UaSFuT59aa	I don't think anyone besides Griffin is top pick worthy. Potential-wise, Rubio could be great and Curry could be a Monta Ellis type, maybe even with better passing abilities. I'm real skeptical about some of the other top prospects like Jrue Holiday and Jordan Hill. They don't look like sure things to me. Hasheem Thabeet is the only 7-footer that will go high in the lottery, but he has very limited skills offensively. He'd be a good fit for a few lottery teams like the Wiz and Bobcats. I want to see Griffin go to OKC to give Durant a post presence. I want to see Rubio or Curry go to Washington and force their hand in trading Arenas, once he can show he's healthy enough to have suitors. The point guard that doesnt go to Washington should go to Sacramento, because Udrih is not a type flight starting PG. I also like James Harden from Arizona St. He's a SG and would be a good fit for the Cats or the Raptors who need some athleticism at that position.|`|UMVWQiYJaa	ya i dont see griffin going number one, maybe james harden or hasheem thabeet|`|k6CCzMY5aa	Terrence Williams from Louisville|`|EX8FOnVpaa	Rubio or Curry|`|Mn97YDIyaa	I've heard about Rubio, but idk. There's Stephen Curry, and he's all that comes to mind. Maybe Tyler Hansbrough? I can imagine Griffin going to the Thunder, because they need a big man...They got all excited from getting Nenad Kristic. Wow. Stephen Curry should go to the Clippers. Baron isn't working out, and maybe Stephen can motivate him again. I dunno why, but I can just imagine Psycho T next to Kevin Love in Minnesota.|`|UWctMa0Taa	Luke Harengody  Jrue Holiday  Blake Griffen  Tyler Hansbrough  Stephan Curry  Jack McClinton, if he enters the draft  A.J.

mIVhX0H4aa	well i tell you one thing there is one way but recommend a tampon unless you can stay in the water without getting out. when you have you period you can go in the water and it stops bleeding (try it in the bath tub) but when you get out it will start again....sorry i hope this helps a little|`|hyLnJibTaa	I understand him not wanting you to use a tampon but It is very unsanitary if you do not put one in. You will infect the entire pool. Tell him that you can put a small one it and they are really easy to get out. If you get tampax pearl you can to even fell them. I hope this will help you if I new another way I would totally tell you sorry.|`|Bo11l8xQaa	Your DAD has a strict rule of tampon use? I would be furious as hell. Say, "Dad. I am going to go swimming.

XrCc85kNaa	Paulie didn't deserve that MVP...  Ray Allen was the winner...|`|Klw3Ke3Haa	For a team, the 2004 finals was the closest. The Pistons didn't have a All-Star game starter, but the Lakers did have Shaq and Kobe. But it was Billups who won the finals MVP. BTW on individuals we all know that it was P.P. of the Celtics. You don't need to rub it in on him and be so hard on him. I mean he just isn't a fan favorite like Billups but his buddy KG made it last year. I mean Parker of the Spurs also won it as well without being the All-Star starter.|`|csKyqot0aa	Tony Parker in 2007.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	tony parker in 2007  paulie pierce in 2008..|`|mff1vstNaa	hmm so how does someone beat the popularity of Lebron and KG? O I bet that has nothing to do with it since the finals mvp should automatically gets the starter spot at the all star game. The finals mvp before Pierce, Parker, took the starter spot over Iverson in the 2008 all star game. o wait he didn't take the pg spot last year, Iverson did.|`|Tr1iCV2Uaa	That's because Lebron James and Kevin Garnet which is more popular is already starting...

Though obviously very good, he isn't all that "extraordinarily extraordinary" (think LeBron and Kobe) all the time.    As for your main question, the last time was...2008! Tony Parker was the 2007 finals MVP, but in the 2008 All-Star Game not only he wasn't a starter, he wasn't there at all! At least Paul Pearce was in the East bench!|`|uxregJ0faa	Haha that must hurt Paul Pierce's ego.

Kane has been in the business for a long time and to have him lose to someone like Kofi Kingston is just plain disrespectful. Sure, Kofi is entertaining and a good highflyer, but Kane deserves to be in the Elimination Chamber more than he does. The wwe writers really need to start giving Kane more of a push. Ever since he was drafted to Raw they have been treating him like garbage.|`|3g08yf94aa	yup kofi kingston sucks|`|NRs72Afxaa	I was really pissed off for what they did last monday, Hopefully they make it up next monday as their are 2 more spots left(cross your fingers). Kane deserves one more title shot before he retires.|`|7qeHZe9Yaa	Yeah i really thought they would make up for him not winning the rumble by him being in the chamber but no.    I agree Kofi is exciting but a win over /Kane was not necessary give the guy a damn push already!|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	it's wwe he could still be in but yes i agree|`|7ImGw976aa	I'm not spitting mad or anything about it but am annoyed.  I think Kane is better than Kofi and so deserves more a shot at things, especially considering he hasn't had a title shot or anything in like yonks.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	I don't know that he deserves to be in there more than Kofi, I'd rather see them both in there. But if I had to choose between the two I would choose Kane for all the reasons that you stated.  I think WWE is under using him in the worst way. This is the guy that is supposed to be Takers brother and was one half of the Bros of Destruction? Look at what they have him do now. Run after Kelly Kelly and get beat by guys he would have squashed a few years ago! I think the WWE started loosing it with Kane when they had him 'marry' Lita.   Let's hope they wake up to his talents before it's too late.  By the way: I see the same thing happening to the Great Kahli now. I love him as a good guy, but do they have to turn him into such a blouse??|`|QYGGn7lBaa	i would of loved to see kane chokeslam someone from the top of the pod or tombstone tombstone them through it i bet they are going to make him a mid carder like IC class|`|QMYNDtHgaa	Naw I don't think anybody wants to see Kane lose to Cena in a chamber or tap out to the STFU (Or what ever they renamed it)     Kofi Kingston should be exciting in the chamber.|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Yes,i think Kofi is exciting and a pretty good wrestler but he doesn't deserve to be in the Elimination Chamber as much as Kane.

If you have any advice for me or have any say in something like that it would be very appreciated if you could shoot me an email: cvanloon@gmail.com    Thanks for your answer earlier and any help/advice you could supply.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	If buying from a shop and not e-bay then ask they usually have nets you can hit into.|`|KW6tdMgKaa	I agree with griller on this one. If a store that sells golf clubs have no facility to let you try them first, it isn't a very good place to shop. Keep looking around for a different store. Im in michigan, and most of the stores i shop at let you try the clubs out first, either they have a range or a simulator for you to swing the clubs. I suggest golf smith or dicks sporting goods, or if near michigan Carl's golf land. Also maybe the store you are shopping at will have demo days with spring coming soon, ask them. Just make sure you try before you buy, no point in spending big money and getting something you may not be able to hit well. Good luck.|`|gTjVVkkvaa	Try to find a Golfsmith or a Dick's sporting goods. You can try them all out there.

AA10068004	It depends if your buying after playoff schedule is released or before hand. I have season tickets and my ticket rep called recently just to check in but also to inform me they will be mailing out invoices for playoff tickets in about a month. If not season tickets I am sure you will be able to buy them once playoffs announced.|`|DvBPLP4saa	I believe the Playoff tickets go on sale shortly after the Playoff schedule for the first round is announced.    Yes, I do believe there are different dates for each round, considering you don't know before hand if a team will make it to a certain round.    ......Though, I'm not 100% sure on any of this. I have never bought playoff tickets....only have gotten them from my family who has season tickets.

7zfcYRqwaa	I know I will get a lot of thumbs down for this, but here it goes.  The most clutch guy I have seen in the past 3 or 4 years is Mark Sweeney.  This is not based on stats or records, but from watching a lot of NL West games over the past 4 years. I noticed that every time Sweeney comes to the plate it is in the late innings of a close game, and he seems to always smack a double in the gap.  I really don't pay attention to the stats when it come to the clutch category, because batting average with risp and 2 out rbi's are not clutch when the game is already out of hand.  So here is my list of my all time clutch performers that I have seen (excluding any player before my time.)    1.  Kirby Puckett  2.  Albert Pujols  3.  Bernie Williams  4.  George Brett  5.  Joe Carter  6.  David Ortiz  7.  Terry Pendelton  8.  Moisis Alou  9.  Derek Jeter  10.  Lenny Dykstra    I know I left some guys off, but this is off the top of my head.|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	Bengie Molina - Giants  ARod  and Derek Jeter- Yankees  Albert Pujols - Cards  Man Ram|`|gwUq6HMUaa	1.Derek Jeter  2.David Ortiz  3.Vladimir Guerrero   4.Reggie Jackson  5.Probably a tie between Lou Gherig and Babe Ruth.|`|67EaIAvbaa	1-ty cobb  2-pete rose  3-tony gwynn  4-ricky henderson  5-lou gehrig|`|PJF4J3iYaa	david eckstein  edgar renteria used to be back in the day  vlad guerrero  magglio ordonez  DEREK JETER|`|zFlfIOQwaa	in any random order:  1.

FXC74TCBaa	I would not recommend breathing to the side. Do you see any olympic swimmers breathing to the side? They are the best swimmers in the world, they know what they are doing. It slows you down a lot. I used to do that when I was younger, but my coach made me stop and my times dropped drastically. Trust me, the best thing is to breath to the front.|`|AA11610448	No, for two reasons.  One, by turning your head you are slowing down both your reaction time and causing turbulence, reducing your glide.  Secondly, if you're swimming competitively, you are required to raise your face out of the water; which would make it even more difficult to turn your head.  But, you can breathe any way you like if you don't care how you do.|`|Rwwk98T5aa	not really because usually it takes more time to turn sideways and take a breath then if you were breathing forward and i 'am pretty sure its illegal at a swim meet.|`|mIVhX0H4aa	yes actually i prefer breathing side ways you can see the Competition better but make sure you straighten your head before you go back under other wise it will slow you down.|`|gWNwUM7Iaa	Somebody on my swim team asked that and my coach was like, "I've never actually seem someone do that but I suppose you could"    I would advise it.  Of course its tiring but its called PRACTICE. And I promise you, you will get it.  I swim breast and I like to check out my competition.  Occasionally I look to one side and then the other on the next breath but before I go under I turn my head straight again.  But either way, you have to bring your head up.  It's legal but to be good and win you need to bring yourself out of the water.    Just practice! Youll get stronger! :)|`|7Iea5FcGaa	I wouldn't. I learned from that mistake. It takes more time to look over and it slows you down a whole lot!!
Z4ApIxaeaa	in the first round if Lesean Mccoy drops to them they will definitely get him because Buckhalter isnt the answer and Westbrook is known as Mr Questionable because he is always questionable before the game    and if Mccoy doesnt drop to them probably and offensive lineman|`|wkZsXDcWaa	A solid offensive lineman. The draft is stocked with good ones this year, and it is always a good choice for any team, especially the Eagles, whose line is aging.|`|nfCH7nkTaa	they need to get a tackle or maybe even 2 in the first round with their picks depending on who is on the board, and I think that they should pick up a power running back unless they get one in free agency, maybe another receiver like avant with good hands,

Wake Forest will upset Louisville tonight....34-27.|`|60ba25528589cc782df7cf63a3359a73aa	50 % 50|`|AA11309197	I think that Wake has a very good chance of doing the deed tonight for sure. Their corners and safety must be able to play man to man coverage because they will need to be able to keep 7 or 8 in the box to be succesful. Also an occsional blitz would not hurt either.     On offense Riley is poised to say the least and I do not feel he will turn the ball over. So I say Wake 20 and Louisville 16

BpY2ed0Gaa	apbbh: Yes, well done you live in America and clearly know nothing about UK gun laws.    G-Force - unless you can prove your eligibility to the skirmisher defence against the Violent Crimes reduction Act 2006, then it is ILLEGAL to repaint a two tone gun into realistic colours (counts as manufacturing a Realistic Imitation Firearm). I'm sure I've told you this before....    To qualify for the defence you need to be able to prove that you're a regular player at an insured site. The simplest ways to do this are by holding a site membership or by becoming UKARA registered.|`|x7NtYD8Aaa	i live in america and as long as there is parts of the orange tip showing or some distinct difference between a real gun and an air soft then you should be fine.|`|Y4mz8BShaa	Do you have the permit to buy guns that aren't clear or multicoloured?

The people who qualify are Kofi, Jericho, and... ...I forget the rest. Shane attacked Orton and made him run back 2 his mommy.|`|RxRYlOblaa	at the start of RAW, Randy orton, with rohdes and dibiase, and randy's therapist, and 2 lawyers came to the ring, and randy orton said he wasn't responsible for his actions, because he has a disorder, called IED, which is baciclyy uncontrollable anger, and he told stephanie, he would sue the wwe with 2 lawsuits if she fired him:    1. wwe knew about his disorder, IED ( Intermittent Explosive Disorder )    2. He won the royal rumble, which garentees his title shot at wrestlemania, and he said if he got fired it was a breach odf his contract and he would cancel wrestlemania!!!!!    then randy orton and his people walked away     and then it was a tag team title match with cryme tyme vs miz and morrison, and miz and morrison won.    then kofi defeated kane for a qualifiling match for No way out, elimination chamber    and chris jericho talked about the movie: the wrestler, and showed a vidieo of mickey rourke saying he was going to beat chris jericho at wrestlemania, and chris jericho siadmickey rourke was out of line    then chris jericho defeated CM Punk for a qualifiling match for No way out, elimination chamber    then John cena defeated Shawn micheals for a qualifiling match for No way out, elimination chamber    rosa mendes attacked melina again, and beth said to santino thet they could keep her      then rey mysterio defeated william regal for a qualifiling match for No way out, elimination chamber    then Randy orton came out to talk to stephanie mcmahon with his 2 lawyers, therapist,and rhodes and dibaise, and randy orton got angry and was shouting at stephanie to fire him, so he could sue her then she sidd it wasnt going to be that easy, and the whole of raw roster was standing at the ramp, and shane mc mahon came and he beat up randy orton and rhodes, and dibiase, and it took 3 wrestlers to hold shane back from chasing randy back stage, and then raw ended.|`|pXAOppvraa	Here's the basic:  Randy Orton threated WWE and Steph Mcman that he was going to sue her if she was going to fire him.  He won the Royal Rumble so that makes him eligible for Wrestlemania and the other excuse was his condition he claims was IED that made him do that to Mr. Mcman.  Cena is still the champion and fought that night against HBK.  This match was for the Elimination chamber at the next pay-per-view but HBK wasn't doing this for him, it was for JBL.  Kofi Kingston, Rey Mysterio, Jerico, and Cena were annonced to be in that chamber, but not JBL.  One more thing Randy Orton got beatened up by Shane O' Mac.( this is Mr Mcman's son)

mqgS6Dfxaa	October 9th, 1996, game 1 of the ALCS.  Bottom of the 8th inning, Orioles beating the Yankees 4 to 3.  Derek Jeter hits a deep fly to right field where Tony Tarasco goes back to the fence to make a play on the play.  Suddenly a 12 year old kid named Jeffrey Maier reaches over the fence and deflects the ball into the stands, prevented Tarasco from making a play on it.  The Orioles claim spectator interference but umpire Rich Garcia allows the Home Run to stand and the Yankees would go on to win the game in 11 innings.  Later, after reviewing the play, Garcia admits it was spectator interference and should not have been a home run.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	Don't know, don't care!

Before 1931, i.e. through most of Ruth's most productive years, the umpire called the play based on the ball's final resting place "when last seen". Thus, if a ball went over the fence fair, and curved behind the foul pole, it was ruled foul. Beginning in 1931 and continuing to the present day, the rule was changed to require the umpire to judge based on the point where the ball cleared the fence. Jenkinson's book (p.374-375) lists 78 foul balls near the foul pole in Ruth's career, claiming that at least 50 of them were likely to have been home runs under the modern rule."    interesting|`|0KAxlpqEaa	fasd|`|zcROgXsQaa	I dont know,but there are probably a ton|`|f89e7a5b56d3b4714ed4e14a2765ea08aa	Anytime a fan reaches over the wall and interferes with a play they should be thrown out of the park.|`|c0e14d7d647dbc349cc2802d5f42eaa3aa	I can really only remember the HR's that weren't. ie: Delgado's last year at Yankee Stadium on Sunday Night Baseball.|`|6ExGOj6Haa	sdcs|`|2wAPwZ1kaa	Johnny Damon's 1st inning ALDS HR
l4WEwTWwaa	Hell no. Manny can not fight welterweights and these questions from his hardcore fans need to stop. He beat an old man at welter, seriously get over the euphoria of the de la hoya fight and realize that he is simply too small for welters. Cotto would absolutely kill pacquiao. I can see broken ribs with Cotto shots to the body. Manny would be unable to hurt him and speed is going to be his only weapon. The only fight at welter I can see possible for him is mayweather and that will only be possible if he beats Hatton and mayweather can be bribed out of retirement.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	countee 1 and john s hit it right.    roach is not stupid to let manny pick a fight against a legit welter like cotto.  as good as manny is he only moved to 147 to meet dela hoya half way.  with respect to hatton, hatton is merely a light welter and pacquiao is still game at that weight.  but for pacquiao to challenge or accept challenges atgainst legit welters is hard to fathom.  see, the deal is most of the current pacquiao fans dont remember that once upon a time pacquiao was a flyweight (112 lbs).  a guy climbing from that division to welter was unheard of even during the golden era of boxing.  for that to happen its either they are out of their freakin mind or the purse is too high for manny to resist.    its not gonna happen.|`|6QhACK70aa	yeah and manny wins;)|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	It depends on whats left of cotto at the end of this year and how well he peforms , he has 1 fight next month which is more or less a tune up fight for him. Then he is supposed to fight margarito again in june (not sure thats still gonna happen).For all we know cotto could be damaged goods after the beating he took in the margarito fight .. we will have to wait and see.  If he wins his fight next month i dont think he has quite earned the right to fight manny yet , he would have to beat margarito first in the rematch. If he can manage to do all that yeah the fight could happen , if he doesnt or loses to jennings or margarito not a chance he gets a crack at pacman. Mosley should be first in line after hatton for a fight with Manny Pacquiao.|`|CDeZOLmgaa	Once Manny beats up Hatton he will probably fight the winner of Mosley vs Cotto, which is logically the next fight for Mosley. Unless Mosley wants to wait around for a Mega fight with Manny.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	yes and no. one problem is margarito,cotto and manny are all promoted by arum so it is possible. the problem is manny really does not need to fight cotto for any reason. he should fight hatton, mayweather(maybe) and a marquez rematch then retire.|`|8oC5AHzNaa	Yes!..This fight can happen...If Manny beats Hatton and Cotto takes care of Jennings this could be a end of the year fight...It would be a blockbuster fight...It would be very very hard to choose a winner...I would be rooting for Cotto but its a toss up and a great fight if it goes down...|`|R0J1W3BCaa	No I can't Freddy Roach isnt stupid enough to put Manny In with Miguel Cotto. If Cotto isnt even some what close to his old slef he would seriously hurt Pacquiao.|`|jcDrei6Zaa	Yes this could happen but the chances is very small|`|jHqV6yUxaa	Cotto would outclass overrated Manny.
N99K6KgEaa	charlton till i die.    see you saturday..........
yEsw7UkWaa	It would have to be WCW as it was when it was WWE vs WCW and I don't think Vinnie Mac would allow that.   It seems to be that anything the WWE owns goes downhill (ECW)   If they could allow them to be the old brands with the same competitors they had, then yes, it would be awesome. It would also add some excitement back to the business.|`|l6g3moiEaa	I think that what needs to happen is for TNA to grow a pair and actually start putting shows on side by side with the WWE shows. Lack of any real competition has made WWE fat and lazy, and you have to remember that the Attitude Era only began because WCW became a major force in the industry. WWE introducing WCW as a new brand wouldn't be enough, just as ECW isn't enough: it's still a WWE show, as there would still be a ton of WWE wrestlers on their show every week. Bad idea. Only real competition from a show not financed by the WWE could fire up the ratings that both WWE and TNA need right now.|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	wwe is wwe if wcw was reopened by vinnie mac people would say it sucks and it kinda would suck like they say ecw sucks  cause vinnie mac owns them all and it would still be wwe just a wcw logo|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	What talent would their be to make a new version of WCW a success? so the same thing won't happen again like with ECW. There's still guys with WCW roots in the WWE (Jericho, Rey Mysterio, Gregory Helms) but thats not enough to successful bring back such a big name brand. Unless they did fold ECW and SD, took the best young talent from those brand and put them on WCW. Guys like Evan Bourne, Jack Swagger, Ricky Ortiz, The Brian Kendrick, MVP, Shelton Benjamin.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	They should cancel ECW and Smackdown and then bring up WCW and RAW. I don't know if they would use the NWO again or not but it would be cool to see...|`|yvtGL6RTaa	they need to get rid of ecw...and tna needs to be stopped...tna has way to manny gay storylines...and almost no wrestling these days...its hard to follow all of them...but bringing back WCW wouldnt work...|`|9Us6XYg8aa	I agree they should do this.  but make it nation or worldwide.|`|BAurzDXtaa	I don't think that they should do that because it wouldn't be WCW it would be the WWE presents WCW. They wouldn't have the wrestlers that were WCW mainstays, announcers, managers, etc, etc. It would ruin the legacy of WCW. Look at what the WWE turned ECW into.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Absolutely not. That would be awful, because it wouldn't be like the original WCW, and it would tick off the WCW audience that stopped watching wrestling because WCW went out of business. And WCW only beat WWE in the ratings for 83 weeks, which  is a long time, but the majority of time, WWE was ruling the ratings war|`|cbsAZVNQaa	Nothing has ever been as screwed up as the wcw purchase. Vince could have set it up as a complete different federation and had dream matches etc. I think their excuse at the time was that the WCW brand was so tarnished from it's last few years that there was no money in it. Allot of people think that Vince can't stand brands and wrestlers that he didn't make.|`|Y93pUmAGaa	because evem though they own it now....come on 4 brands. i know that would be great but it would be to hard to follow the storylines if you missed like 2 shows. so i think thats why and it would cost the wwe more money and they already made budget cuts and fired 10 superstars.

7qeHZe9Yaa	Clever clever clever way to get ALL of our attention.      And i agree,we all know whats going to happen nowadays because of spoiler sites and things like that.We notice every single detail about a storyline,match,etc. We think gimmicks like the undertaker aren't scary and people like Kane who we should hate we feel he should get a title.There is no way we can go back to the good old' days where we wouldn't pay so much attention to things.

I dont look at spoilers and I don't care to, the surprise is what makes me enjoy it.  Ever heard of the term 'an escape from reality'?????  That's what I watch it.. its ENTERTAINMENT, hence the little 'e' in WWE?

Personally, for wrestling in ring, ROH is where it's at, for a middle ground between the wrestling and entertainment, TNA is the choice, and for even more entertainment go to WWE. Giving up on wrestling though is something I won't do because I enjoy a lot of it still when there's a good story.|`|7YTcUrklaa	1. Yes we as wrestling fans understand it is fake, but you know why we come back it entertains us, and even though majority of its aspects are fake, people do get injured and get hurt.  2. TNA was and never will be good wrestling|`|de14HtA9aa	I agree with some of your points like how it was good wrestling back in the 80's and 90's.  But like everything in life they change along with the times wether good or bad.  I know they have a lot of repetitive storylines and they exposed too much about what goes on behind the scenes I guess that's why they refer to the WWF/WWE as entertainment.  As far as not watching it anymore I don't think I could do that really I grew up watching wrestling since the mid 80's so regardless of how much it's changed I still watch it cause at least my favorite wrestler is still wrestling and that would be the Undertaker.|`|6dff9c8d78f35f9cfa54823794d13d08aa	HAHA! Your GAY! Wrestling Is So Not For Fags!  I Bet Ur Mama Watches It, And If You think Its Gay Then Y U Watch It??? HM?  Yeah Answer That One! HAHA!  And Only SOME Of Wrestlings Fake!  So There!

Y'all should watch real wrestling, like they do in college or the Olympics.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Read your question, got all heated up, was going to fire off an answer, then read the answer given by Outdated Shelflife. Ended up being at peace with your stupidity.  By the way: Don't people that watch football, baseball (etc) know all the behind the scenes stuff, the moves, the strategy's etc...|`|qFC5t5p4aa	well if your hair is really like it is in your picture than you are a fag|`|fV5BQK6xaa	Then why watch movies, drama, soap opra, ect if you know how all the special effects are done. Some people have a better imagination then other people and kids have a better imagination then anyone which is why they can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality. And just to let you know a recent Indiana University study of 50 WWF broadcasts revealed that approximately 40 minutes out of every two-hour show is devoted to actual wrestling in the ring.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	If by fake you mean completely painless, fully rehearsed and extremely easy, your sadly mistaken. Wrestlers get HURT, they DO NOT practice ONE move on each other before the match, maybe 1-2 min's going over something on a piece of paper! Easy? Don't make me laugh, it takes YEARS of bodybuilding, power lifting and martial arts/boxing training before they can even join a developmental territory! And that's 3 more years of hard work, then on TV, they have to keep their cool in front of thousands in attendance and millions at home!    So, try doing a swanton bomb of a 30 foot structure, then do a whisper in the wind off a steel cage, then do a drop kick when you weigh 517 pounds. This is ALL fake, easy and painless? You are very misinformed.|`|JiCfYfLraa	nobody delete this please its funny because this guy is a idiot he waste 5 points on something he doesnt like and now we are getting all up in his stupid pathetic ***. you sound so stupid how is wrestling gay. what does gay have to do with wrestling you damn ******** ********.|`|482oQASHaa	Get a life|`|HixWazH7aa	Do us all a favor and shoot yourself in the head|`|aULZ8D10aa	It sucks today, not as good as back then.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	WWE Classics on Demand shows me wrestling from the WWWF, the WWF, the WWE, NWA, WCW, WCCW, AWA, the Original ECW, Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling and other wrestling promotions. I get to see WWF Syndicated Shows from Major Cable Systemsm such as MSG (New York), Prime (Philadelphia), Montreal, Houston, Toronto, Los Angelesa and other major markets. WWE has decades of wrestling footage and matches from a lot of wrestling promotions. Evenm during the 1980's as the WWF spread thoughout the United States and destroyed all the wrestling territiories, we knew a lot of stuff because of Magazines like Pro Wrestling Illustrated, Inside Wrestling and the Wrestler. Moreover, during the 1980's I watched wrestling from different wrestling promotions 7 days a week.    Yes, some people analyze, I treat it like a business, just like the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, MLB, NHL, etc. Some of us follow other wrestling promotions besides WWE and TNA and we get great matches and athleticism. Yes, my brother and I will be at Wrestlemania XXV, but we will also see 2 Ring of Honor Shows while we are in the Houston, Texas area. If TNA wants us to see them, they better schedule some shows there, otherwise, I will be at WWE Fan Fest most days there.    We knew about "Pushes", "Heels", "Faces" and other jargon before the internet. It does not interfere with my enjoyment because I have sense enough to know that WWE and TNA are in business to make money just like any other businesses and decisions are made to make the most money. That has always been true in Professional Wrestling, at least for the last 100 years or more, this is nothing new.|`|6nY99hPmaa	you did not just say wrestling was great in the 80's...  LMAO it's obvious your a dumb@ss , i don't even need to replay to your question.|`|IMQm9JTMaa	THEN DONT WATCH IT    why are you watching WWE if you hate it so much    BTW: wwe is doing better than tna & has always done better than tna.    i'm not dissing TNA, i'm just saying its just your opinion that TNA's better.

I can see him going to WWE someday. I just hope they don't tone him down too much when he gets there.|`|SOuezSW2aa	yes.|`|B9h6VhQOaa	ya if he did he would deserve it because he's a great athlete|`|sqfjfR3iaa	The Phenomenal AJ Styles has turned WWE down several times. They wouldn't know what to do with such a talented wrestler and wouldn't let him do many of his moves. I'm perfectly content for him to stay in TNA and wrestle in Ring of Honor, Full Impact Pro, Pro Wrestling Guerilla and New Japan Pro Wrestling.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	WWE would never push him. They'd think he's too small. He's better off in the smaller TNA.|`|Pne371ESaa	I think he is Main event Material but WWE wouldnt use him right. although there are many dream matches Heres 4 for example:    AJ Styles vs. HBK  AJ Styles vs. Jeff Hardy  AJ Styles vs. Shelton Benjamin  AJ Styles vs. Randy Orton    i hope TNA ends the MEM vs. Frontline feud right with having AJ win the title from Sting sometime this spring or summer and after that Sting says that he can trust AJ to lead the company and Sting retires.|`|yEsw7UkWaa	Hmmm...yep, if they had the right storyline for him. And that's probably asking a lot for the WWE writers! They used a year's worth of brain juice coming up with the Hardy storyline  :)|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Not straight away.  I think it would be built up like Y2Js comeback.  Theres potential for big feuds in WWE with people like HBK, HHH and Orton as well as Y2J.|`|l6g3moiEaa	Oh, hell yeah! Only problem is, WWE has a bad habit of treating stars they pick up from other brands like crap. Goldberg, anyone? I can't blame him for cutting out on them like he did, after The Rock and Jericho, it was the Triple H and Evolution show every week (or what I like to call, how much crap can we put Goldberg through THIS week...?) until that godawful WM against Lesnar. WWE just doesn't know what to do with its talent! (Sean O'Haire, anyone?)|`|cbsAZVNQaa	No I think WWE would never give him a push. Look what they did to Ron Killings, Monty Brown, and Wildcat Chris Harris.|`|BL5HoheLaa	He's turned down WWE loads of times. I personally think he should stay at TNA, because WWE wouldnt let him do half the moves he does, and WWE dont have many high risk matches like TNA has i.e X division etc...

p7BjjPtNaa	Yeah, I do. At least he was a one time ECW champion. But they should make him another one too.|`|F3VjJAdiaa	No. But it isn't really his fault. Guys like him, the Miz, Mysterio, Kendrick, all the short guys you can think of~They should be going for the intercontinental belt and that is it in my opinion. Leave the world champ belts for the big men.|`|JiCfYfLraa	did you see him in the royal rumble i was so impressed. john morrision is one of the best wrestlers in the wwe and thats a fact along with shelton benjamin and cm punk. they are the future of the wwe today. i think they need to be push more especially john morrision he sells moves good by the way.|`|aYnduRsxaa	He's very impressive. I know he'll be a future main eventer. I think they need to break up Miz and Morrison because Miz is taking him nowhere. John should be in the ECW Championship picture.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	John Morrison can be a Main Eventer right now. He was a great Intercontinental Champion. The rivalry he had with Jeff Hardy when he was Johnny Nitro a few years ago was a great one. Morrison was a great ECW Champion and had a great rivalry with CM Punk. He is a Multi-Time WWE Tag Team Champion and a Multi-Time World Tag Team Champion. He doesn't have to be a BabyFace, Shawn Michaels has been both a BabyFace and a Heel and many of his greatest victories came as a Heel. Yes John Morrision does deserve it, and he was one of my picks to win the Royal Rumble.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	I've been saying this for a while now. Some people point out his ECW title run, but he was suspended and his singles push was stopped. I think they should give him another singles push. Hes a future main eventer.|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	I think you are absolutely correct!! I personally love John Morrison and I think he is one of the best high flyers the WWE has right now. I think he should win the Money In the Bank match at Wrestlemania 25 and then cash it in and win the World Title and start having Main Event status. (Thats what they did with Punk and everybody loved it) I really think that the WWE writers are not using his full potential to be a main eventer|`|IMQm9JTMaa	hes a very talented wrestler, but he could use a couple more years of experience, then he'll deffinatley be ready.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	He has everything needed to be a main-eventer, he needs to feud with someone that's willing to put him over. I think if he and Jericho or Cena had a feud with would be interesting. Hell why not have him face HBK at WM25 that would be a huge test for him|`|l6g3moiEaa	JM is a very talented wrestler, and there was a time a couple years back before the ECW trade, he was doing main event work, yeah? But I still think he has a bit more to go before he can seriously hang with the likes of Batista, Cena, Undertaker, Triple H, Edge, etc. Even CM Punk, though I think he deserved more of a chance with the belt, isn't quite there yet. More work on his mic skills, promos, and lose that loser The Miz, I could take him seriously.|`|KXmMlqA9aa	YA! He's been ready! He's an awsome wrestler.|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Not yet. I think theres still a bit of a gap between Morrison/Benjamin and CM Punk and then a gap between Punk and main event.  Morrison needs to cut Miz, and find a good feud to make him.  Perhaps against Punk.  I was disapointed Morrison wasn't in Rumble longer but put in a good showing.|`|59r8mfsfaa	Sure put him in a winner gets his head shaved match and makes sure he wins, so that he has to get his pretty little head shaved.|`|6d0250ca8941e47460eda0499a69b2caaa	JOHN is ready for main event level, he needs tbe a single wrestler and leave miz alone.|`|Y93pUmAGaa	i think he will be ready in a few years ... but can you really picture him beating randy orton , cena or even triple h ...i sure cant|`|770573c4f38cca3bd501e926925bcf9baa	yes he's being held back he's better then both Hardy's needs to get off that tag team stuff.he can stay in the ring with orton hhh edge cena easy|`|EwXx5UGYaa	Yes.

The Tuesday Night Delight, formerly known as Johnny Nitro, officially renamed himself John Morrison, his given birth name, on the historic July 17, 2007, edition of ECW. Morrison had reached the peak of his fame with the ECW Championship and he believed he could "be himself" from that point, forward. Shortly thereafter, Morrison found unexpected success alongside another brazen, rising star in the Land of the Extreme, The Miz. The unlikely tandem secured the WWE Tag Team Championship on SmackDown territory following the unique talent exchange arrangement between SmackDown and ECW managing officials. The Shaman of Sexy's vanity reached new heights, much like his sports-entertainment career. And Morrison has good reason to be confident. He has never been too far away from gold since his debut in 2005, capturing tag team gold as well as the Intercontinental Championship. The Shaman of Sexy was ultimately drafted to ECW during the 2007 Supplemental Draft on WWE.com, and his career was given new life. As the world can now see, Morrison has taken full advantage of his extreme home, and ECW may never be the same. Alongside, the Miz, John Morrison won the WWE Tag Team Championship, defeating Montel Vontavious Porter & Matt Hardy on SmackDown. Since, the duo has dominated WWE's tag team division.|`|AA11432638	john morrison very underated and an exellent superstar in everyway maybe a few more years from main eventing though     but years ago we didnt think edge or hardy would have been wwe champions but they proved how good they are

That's a pretty close up pic, now look closely to the part where is connected to the "nose" of the jig-head. You simply open up the "latch" that connects the two "safety-pin" parts together.

Add a small split-shot to get down in the deeper water if you want, i do. This is a pretty good little lure for $1.00, and it practically catches everything.

Y4mz8BShaa	All airsoft guns chambered for 6mm can use .12's. Whether or not they'll kill the gun depends on whether it's a spring gun with under 225 FPS with a .20.    No. .20's at the minimum. Never use .12's in an AEG.
Z5xgSATSaa	Depends on a couple of things. First, the steer tube( the part that attaches the fork to the handlebar) has to be long enough. Often the head tube on a road bike is longer than the one on a mountain bike. If this is your case, it won't work. To find out, you have to remove the fork from the road bike frame and compare the length of the two steer tubes. If the mountain bike steer tube is more than a couple of mm shorter, the transplant will not work. Next you have to check the diameter of the steer tubes. Older bikes use a smaller diameter steer tube, so if they are not the same diameter, it won't work. The headsets may be threaded or unthreaded. If the mountain bike fork uses a different type, you will also have to transplant the headset from the mountain bike to the road bike. Best case: an easy job that would take an experienced mechanic 1/2 hour. If you have to exchange some parts, it could take an hour. Worst case with incompatible forks, not possible    \|`|JSGLKnA4aa	ok road bike uses 700c wheels mtn bike uses 26" not the same. the front end of road bike will be approx 2" low. if the steerers match. you'll have high seat, weight transfer to front will be more than 60%. depending on fork you should be able to get replacement100.00.  you'll have to chek if frame is actually straight. the head tube could be twisted out of alignment. or somewhere else along frame. you'll have to replace headset including forkcrown race.

Work on your filming, editing, and all that... then once you get better you can start filming better skateboarding and getting better equipment.  Start making local videos, and hopefully one day one of your friends will be crazy good at skating and you will have been filming him for years and he will get sponsored and the team manager will see all the footage that you shot... and then maybe you will be able to film even better skateboarders... and maybe then you will be able to make skate videos professionally.  I hope you are in it for the long haul!|`|Cfuh4NiHaa	Film some of your friends and if the filmings good, you'll get noticed. I'm not sure, but I think it's the only way. But start out small first.

AA10517208	Hop ups work by pushing down a small rubber piece into the barrel giving the BB backspin, letting physics take over giving the BB more accuracy and range. There is no particular place to set it. Or i should say nobody can tell you where to put it, what you should do is take it out to an area where you have plenty of space and where nobody can see you shooting and fire a few round on semi automatic. If the BBs arc upwards, adjust your hop up until the bbs keep a relatively flat trajectory with a little bit of climb. If the bb travels straight about 50 feet then drops down you need to add a bit more hop up.|`|boB43p0xaa	hop makes it shoot further  just set it to what ever th range is|`|SWqqjjPwaa	The higher the hop up is set the longer the bb will go before having a backspin put on it which gives you greater range....longer distance shooting needs to be set higher cqb shooting should be set low...

Myself i run for my weight maintanance plus getting my ''me time'' away from the kids lol.    Anyway, you're best best is to look at this link below, it has a good plan to follow(go to the bottom, it has a diary plan)  http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/...    The key to running is to start it slowly, build it up slowly even if you feel good, invest in good running shoes bc they're your key equipment and can prevent injuries. wear something comfy.    When I first started, I'd go one block, and if I had to walk some of it I did (and believe you me I did have to walk--alot!!), once I could get one block sort of successfully I'd run up the next block.     IT took me four months to wear I could run comfortably and with my breathing in check. Breathing while running is a learned art (seriouslY) and you find what works for you, some people do deep inhales but I"m a puff -puff short breathe.    Key is to have fun, and just go with it|`|CI5qOBcDaa	anyone can run its easy.  for the first time i would just start on the treadmill at an easy pase, let's say about 5.5 and run about a mile or for 10 minutes and see how it feels. make sure that you stretch before you run so you don't get hurt. if you feel like you can do more than go for it. i always find the first few minutes the hardest so just push past it and keep going.     good luck hope that helps =]|`|ob0ZRIQjaa	start off by walking on the treadmill twent minutes a day. after you have done that for a week go up to thirty minutes. then after that week walk with an incline. then start jogging after those three weeks. you should be ready to go soon after that since you are twenty five|`|AA11573840	Start with brisk walks and get that heart going.

Vtwb90tRaa	WOW, I can't believe someone suggested RB for someone 6'9"...    You could stay your current size, work on your catching and speed, and be an amazing big target at WR, but the more likely position for you would be bulking up just a little (You may even be fine at 250) and playing TE. Your size is pretty much ideal for TE. Having no prior playing experience, you have an extremely slim chance of being recruited on, but if you go to a division II school as a walk on, you will be a good coach's dream if you can catch.     Your two most realistic options are TE and OL. TE you're pretty much the right size for, but you would have to put on 50 lbs for OL, and have to learn the techniques of blocking. There's a reason why most people say an offense is only as good as their line, it's not an easy thing to master.     As for TE, you work on your hands, and get a little speed behind you, and you'll do fine. If you impress the coach enough, you can actually get a chance at a partial scholarship for the next school year.|`|utJYCCvaaa	if your fast then you could probably be a DE or RB or LB but if your slow you need to get up to 300 lbs and can go up as a OL men (I know this cause my friend had to do almost the same thing)|`|KZsdVGJzaa	jus walk on to at a college|`|XenkWmShaa	Never to late|`|ZbZtJ105aa	Since you never played before, you would have to first get accepted into a college, then try to walk on, it could be down. But you would have to work really hard especially if your talking division 1 football. I would try to go to a small school because your chances are better at making the team. I would choose a college that you would like for reason's other than football, as you may not make the team. If you do make the team I wouldn't be discouraged if you sat on the bench because it will take you a while to get in shape and learn the game.     Good luck  hope everything goes well|`|JXGnwBFEaa	NEVER to late|`|5BffoduJaa	I guess for your size and if your way good then you should play never give up on your dreams

Brock is always in great shape, but moving around constantly at 275-280 wears him down and it would do that to anyone of that size...we saw this in the Couture fight as Brock was out of gas in the 1st.    For Kongo to win, he simply needs to stay on his feet, move smartly and doge punches. If he does this, Brock will chase him and throw punches...which will wear him down. When Brock tires, Kongo can take over using his own incredible size and strength.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	i dont think so. not only is brock super powerfull, strong, and big but he is unbelievably fast, fast hands, fast feet, and fast takedowns. doesn't matter who you are if he wants to take you down he's going too and he's working with world champion jiu jitsu guys to improve his understanding of submissions. cause it doesn't matter if you know how to do an armbar or choke, you have to be able to defend against them too. i think if he gets some better muay thai, and learns submissions and sub defense he's not gonna be beaten|`|981f0a6a977e8d11dd72df8cf1f00533aa	Holy crap yeah i was thinking the same thing.

Go to america and be prepared to pay alot of money and be prepared to get a part time job.      2. sign up to OVW (Ohio Valley Wrestling) which is owned by WWE. OVW is a wrestling school, they also have shows for people who have mastered the training courses.     3. Get in to OVW (if they accept you)   you also have to pay for training fees.    4. pass the first and second training courses (prices are higher for 2nd course)     5. Congratulations!! you will now be on TV and be viewed by audience with the OVW shows (you have to pay more for this because it is the 3rd stage of your course).    Note: You need to buy Some fancy Ring attire ( wrestling costume )    6. This is the hard part.   Make sure you NEVER screw up in any of your matches because you are not only being watched on TV and live audience, you are being watched by WWE Scouts!  if they like your performance and think you have potential they will send you a WWE Contract in the mail.    7.

2aa6585421c0e48790f21a9e08f64433aa	Not even. Earl Boykins is far better than Hodge or Blake.    Boykins' NBA career has solidified in recent years in part due to the recent change in rules allowing some forms of zone defense. Boykins's teams had feared playing Boykins, because opponents could exploit his size by trying to post him up. But with the gradual increase in the use of modified zone defenses in the last few years, fewer situations arise where Boykins is isolated alone defending a taller player in the painted area. Moreover, since few point guards in the league have polished post-up moves as part of their offensive repertoire, opposing teams are generally reluctant to abandon their usual offense in an effort to exploit Boykins' size.    In Blake's first season with the Blazers, he became a starter and played a significant role when Sebastian Telfair was injured. Blake's playing time increased from 14.7 minutes and 44 games with only 1 start in 2004-05 to 26.2 and 68 games with 57 starts in 05-06. Blake reestablished himself as a terrific passer and fundamental point guard claiming 3rd in the NBA in assists per turnover ratio. He also increased his field goal percentage by 11%.    People are still disposing Earls talent for his height.|`|d611e6ba51d486b4efd99137d3bcdf30aa	I think Denver was dumb to give up Boykins.  His quickness is good.  He is great for shaking things up or establishing a new tempo.  He will help the Bucks for sure.  They definitely need it.|`|9i4xh9VQaa	OMG... Boykins was so cool with the Nuggets. I liked him with Camby and 'Melo...    But since Iverson is there... I'm sure this trade was better for both team, considering that Redd was out...    But Steve Blake? That player is like...

qkZvTTFxaa	for the 100th time NO  they are a decent defense but when you have given up that many points you are not a top defense    you are the one who asked this question yesterday dont get me wrong the Skins are better than anyone thought they would be but they have allot of season left and when you are getting over 20 points put on you everyweek and your offense has to come up with big plays in the 4th quarter to win your defense hasnt shut anyone down    I just want you to promise me you will post this again after the Philly game so we can once again get your excuses why teams tack points on your "greatest defence ever"|`|EzZgHpbDaa	yes, mostly b/c they have Laron Landry playing centerfield for them. Gives them more options to do things defensively. Just think if they still had Taylor(RIP)|`|xgTI0thMaa	No..not saying they are the worst are not really good but not the best in the whole NFL.

Horton and ranked  4    Those are the 4 main guys the rest of the offense doesnt make it in the top 20.

Fighting vents some of that passion so it doesn't get vented through the use of dirty play, like stick infractions. (High-sticking, cross-checking, etc.)  - Hockey is a sport of tradition. Players have been fighting for a long time. Why change that?  - It IS entertaining to the fans. (And the players, again!)    It is important to remember that while the NHL allows fighting, it is not "legal". You do get a penalty or penalties for fighting. You get a 5-minute major EVERY time you fight.|`|DmaKycXraa	i know it is for the extra attraction of the game. some people watch hockey games just for that, but they allow that for the increasing action of the game, but they do break it up after a while.      can i plz have best answer!!!|`|qcDHyhdtaa	Most people are attracted to sex, violence, and rock and roll. The rest are nuns.     As long as the players follow the Code of fighting it's all good.|`|qaHM2mIlaa	Because it's entertaining.  Especially when the person knows how to fight :)|`|LqBmMCGxaa	A hockey fight signifies many things. First, it shows your teammates what you will give for them. In many ways, it shows the respect you have for your fellow teammates. Many hockey fights occur after a check to a teammate. A fight is a way to show teammates that you will fight for them. It also is a way to keep order in a game. If you didn't have fights, you'd have the goons going "head hunting" all the time. Fights make it so that goon will be kept in line if he goes "head hunting." High school hockey in my area has fighting banned, and I'm not sure how it is in other places, but here you can't fight. Because there is zero tolerance for fighting, many players go out and literally try to take the heads of the opponents off every single shift. In leagues where fighting is allowed, you rarely see a guy throwing mind numbing checks every shift. You see the occasional bump, but no huge hits. So those are some reasons why fighting in hockey occur. No, it's not a bad example. And no, attracting ratings isn't a priority either....hockey isn't on tv much anymore, so they can't really get people who dislike hockey to watch it.|`|GPjsNqp9aa	I can tell you are not a huge fan so I will not make fun of you.    1) Yes, a fight can happen at any game  2) It is a bad example, but you get over it  3) They don't do it to attract ratings but fighting does attract a lot of ratings.|`|DK0Df5Dsaa	BECAUSE IT IS FUN|`|xORjCjEOaa	Didn't we just had someone ask this question a month ago or so?  Figure it out for yourself!|`|60ba25528589cc782df7cf63a3359a73aa	is part of hockey|`|OV8QGAa2aa	In a game most people stand up right? If they stop letting these go the fans boo right? they would rather upset a few people upset about the fight then the majority of the people upset about no fight. It is part of the game.|`|08rmR5Nvaa	it gets their team pumped up to win and they may also hate the person they are fighting most likely

Por eso es que se desatan tan tremendas batallas en los foros, para los mexicanos el ftbol no es tan importante como para los argentinos por la diferencia cultural que existe entre ambos pases, en cualquier parte del mundo se conoce la gran riqueza cultural y social de Mxico, mientras que de Argentina realmente solo se sabe de sus problemas sociales y de la falta de races culturales, por esa razn cuando se ataca al deporte que les da sus nicas  satisfacciones enloquecen y se lanzan con improperios dignos de cualquier cantina de quinta.|`|8d01f990d5a5079a072c44cb46d6d547aa	yo no tengo drama, pero hay personas que es mejor ignorarlas, no se puede llegar ni siquiera a tener una charla intercambiando opiniones, no digo llegar a un acuerdo, pero opinar sin agredir esta bueno, pero parece que nunca va a pasar...  besote...  aguante piedra buena!!! jeje...  naty|`|c53c92cb22f0d9fd8ae099201ed70f76aa	Yo solo estoy y respondo preguntas de futbol argentino y defiendo mi pais y todo lo que los mejicotes digan en contra de nosotros.

FTsTKIsuaa	It's getting worse, that's for sure. The only way WWE is going to get better is if they see TNA as a threat, and frankly they don't yet.     I'm not a big TNA fan, but they are coming on strong. The more fans they bring in, the more WWE execs will (hopefully) realize that they have to step their game up in both creative and the overall quality of the wrestling in general.|`|wsIzraTzaa	definitley, hes seeing his biggest competition since WCW and hes not competing 2 well.    hes tryna carry the entire WWE thru on cena at the moment, but cena cant even carry a crowd, (theyr booing every time as i would be). its like he wants another popular star like rock or austin out of cena but he doesnt have the skills or charisma even close 2 either. to make things worse hes winning even more than either of them ever did, like hogan or sumthing, overcoming unbeatable odds all the time. neither could wrestle but hogan had possibly the most charisma and crowd support out of anyone.|`|4T30n2lPaa	TNA can't afford WWE , they can't even buy th wwe champion belt,  how many times do i have to tell you gay peoples that i'm not selling my business  I'm VINCE & if u have a problem e-mail me|`|IgXqUytkaa	that is a really good question i dont know.|`|1838b50b11c178bd97308d9bb3b013b9aa	i agree, vince isnt smart at all|`|RcbW8znmaa	yeah, he's basically doing everything he can to make us hate WWE and watch TNA.

f6faf6f044cbda3f249aa99630ce1b4aaa	1) Frey!!!! Il cartonne en Italie, il est hallucinant!!! En Italie ils ne comprennent d'ailleurs pas pourquoi il n'est pas le numro 1. Je le met en numero 1 pour son talent.  2) Coupet. Il est bon et rgulier.   3) Je ne sais pas mais je ne selectionnerais pas Landreau..|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	On a pas dj pos cette question un million de fois ???  Coupet sera le titulaire, c'est indiscutable de par son exprience, son statut et son autorit dans les cages.  Frey s'impose de plus en plus comme le numro 2 grace a ses prestations avec la Fiorentina qui fotn oublier sa petite contre-performance pour sa premire slection en Bleu face  l'Ukraine.  Landreau reste une option. Certes le parisien ne russit pas une grande saison mais il n'a plus rien  prouver avec les Bleus, appels dans le groupe depuis 10ans et irrprochable dans son comportement. Et puis garder les buts derrire Sagnol-Thuram-Gallas-Evra/Abidal c'ets autre chose que derrire Ceara-Camara-Yepes-Armand.  Lloris est moins expos mdiatiquement que Mandanda mais je le trouve plus convaincant notamment dans sa concentration alors que le marseillais  parfois tendance  se relacher. Lloris confirme cette saison alors que Mandanda se revle.|`|Pa3VUWWJaa	Mandanda car c'est le meilleur gardien Francais   Coupet car il a bcp d'experience et reste un bn gardien   Frey car il fait des matchs de tres bonnes qualit e a la fiorentina et reste grace a son experience au dessus de Lloris et Landreau|`|af56642e7dbc6e645c50b44bda5c6fa5aa	1/ COUPET  2/ FREY  3/ MADANDA OU LLORIS    LANDREAU AU REPOS  ! ! !|`|4SN6NBW7aa	Ulrich Ram, il est discret mais fait une super saison.|`|28b8ffd524924027cd8cb62e0884efadaa	1) Mandanda  2) Lloris  3) Coupet    Landreau et Frey sont trop souvent des passoires en ce moment.|`|73JPgvWsaa	Si on parle de gardien, il faut de suite carter Landreau !  En plus il ne s'impose pas en EDF, pas etonnant puisqu'il est aussi efficace qu'au PSG, et l il ne peut pas dire que ? vient de la defense.  En supporter j'aimerai Ram, mais objectivement, Mandanda et Lloris serait un excellent choix. On voit avec Marseille que Mandanda prend facilement ses marques et Lloris a dj jou avec les moins de 20 ans en officiel.|`|5natitcCaa	Si Coupet se blesse, on est en plein dedans!!!

J'ai rien contre les rugbyman masi j'en ai marre , on nous parle 24 sur 24 du rugby et surtout en france on est tjrs les meilleurs.  Et quand on perd on a tjrs des excuses.Ah il avait une ampoule, une crampe c'est normal qu'on est perdu et les autres en face c'est pareil ils ont les meme pepins physique.  L'exemple type il y a 3 ans "l'equipe" titrait  pour la rencontre Gasquet / nadal a RG " le choc des titans"     ah bon gasquet c'set un Titan, mais il est nul c'est tout .
Ar7gpHDIaa	Oui, je suis tout  fait d'accord avec toi. S'il y avait la mme politique anti-dopage dans le football, le tennis, le rugby, etc... que dans le cyclisme, on aurait pas mal de surprises. Ainsi, on serait surpris de constater le nombre de "stars" qui prennent des produits dopants. Lorsque tu vois le nombre de matchs que ces joueurs enchainent (un match tous les 3-4 jours pour le football, 1 match tous les 2 jours pour le tennis), il est strictement impossible d'y parvenir en tant "propre". Malgr des prparations physiques (massage, musculation, ect ) de pointe, il ne faut pas exagrer. Les sportifs sont devenus de vritables machines. Je trouve que le cyclisme paie clairement pour tous les autres sports. Dans le milieu sportif, c'est la vraie tte de turc. C'est assurment le sport le plus contr?l au monde. Nanmoins, alors que dans le football ou dans le tennis, la technique du joueur est galement prpondrante, il n'en va pas de mme pour le cyclisme o seul compte la condition physique pour soutenir de tels efforts afin d'enchainer les cols. Aux yeux des tlspectateurs, c'est cel qui fait toute la diffrence. On condamne plus facilement le dopage dans le cyclisme que dans le football car selon les amateurs, il faut "juste savoir pdaler plus vite que les autres". Ce qu'on oublie quand mme, c'est que le cyclisme est l'un des sports les plus durs qui existe. Dop ou non, il ne faut pas sous-estimer la difficult de ce sport. Moi, mme si j'tais surdop, je serais incapable de faire 1/4 de ce que les cyclistes du Tour de France font. Ceux qui critiquent les cyclistes, je les mets au dfi de monter 2-3 fois le Mont-Ventoux ou le Col du Galibier... afin qu'ils se rendent compte que c'est loin d'tre de la tarte... Mais que veux-tu... les fran?ais prfrent critiquer et dnigrer les cyclistes lorsqu'ils regardent le Tour de France sur leur canap avec une bire  la main et la tlcommande dans l'autre...    @plusieurs : franchement, qui peut croire que les contr?les anti-dopages dans le football sont rels...?!?! Ca me fait penser un peu  l'athltisme. Les gars ne se font jamais contr?ls jusqu'au jour o ils font le meeting de Seine-Saint-Denis qui compte pour la Golden League... Et le scandale Puerto o le FC Valence, le Ral Madrid, le FC Barcelone, etc taient impliqus... ? Et bien on a touff l'affaire...|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Bon il faut reconna?tre que pour le foot, le tennis ou le rugby, on ne peut pas doper les aspects techniques ! Mais il y a vraisemblablement du dopage dans ces sports quand on voit les cadences physiques.|`|1ec3edaab69c466828d0c918e8c13f10aa	Faux et archi faux. Il ne faut pas raconter n'importe quoi. Tout les sportifs de haut niveau en France je prcise et quelque soit le sport sont controls et suivi en permanence. Le problme du vlo, c'est qu'il y a eu depuis des annes un laxisme de la part des dirigeants de l'UCI notamment qui a abouti  la situation que nous connaissons aujourd'hui.|`|871YPXGPaa	le cyclisme paye pour ses exagrations !!!...il ne faut pas oublier les coureurs morts !!!!!!!....d'ailleurs , c'est suite  la mort du coureur anglais Tom Simpson pendant une tape du Tour de France en 1967 , que l'on a dcid d'instaurer des contr?les anti-dopage !....bien s?r que le cyclisme n'est pas le seul sport o les sportifs se dopent , mais c'est de loin celui o cette pratique est la plus ancienne et la plus pousse !!!...un journaliste racontait un jour , il y a quelques annes , que dans les annes 60 il tait frquent de trouver des coureurs pendant le Tour , qui couraient et faisaient des mouvements de gymnastique dans les couloirs des hotels  2 ou 3 heures du matin , afin de limiter les risques d'embollie d?  l'absorption de produit augmentant le taux de globules rouges et donc l'paisseur du sang !!!... mditer !|`|8dff9c19a1d0454aa74a18c83547005daa	oui c'est vrai je pense qu'il y en a c'est moins mdiatis mais bon dans le foot,, le tennis etc.. il y a tellement d'argent en jeux !

Dans beaucoup de sports, on ne cherche pas, donc, on ne risque pas de trouver.    Par contre, il y a des contr?les au foot. Par exemple, il y en a eu 300 cpendant l'Euro. Maintenant, je ne sais pas si ces contr?les sont fiables.    J'aurais dis l'inverse concernant le foot. Quand on voit le niveau de la Ligue 1, c'est bien la preuve qu'ils ne sont pas dops.|`|nNg92gzWaa	45 km/h de moyenne en montagne, mme avec des gros mollets, y a un truc, non?|`|720a6ee0165dc382815754b063764886aa	C'est vrai...Tout les ans on nous saoule avec ?a...Ce n'est plus le TdF, c'est le Tour de la suspicion...Ds qu'un type gagne, il est forcement dop....|`|DWf4jq85aa	Tu dis n'importe quoi.  Je travaille dans le milieu sportif et il y a des contr?les anti-dopage dans tout le sport de haut niveau.  Les mdecins experts de l'Agence Fran?aise de Lutte contre le Dopage tudie des dossiers de sportifs pratiquant des sports trs varis (foot, handball, athl, natation, rugby, volley...).    Par contre je suis d'accord avec toi pour dire que le cyclisme est devenu la tte de turc par rapport au dopage.  Les autres sports sont aussi touchs crois moi sur parole, et on en fait pas autant de foin !  Mais la faute ne repose-t-elle pas en partie sur les mdias ?|`|XSSf1z6Raa	Je suis d'accord avec toi. J'ai l'impression que les gens font une fixation sur le cyclisme alors que le dopage est prsent dans la majorit des sports; Je suis toujours surprise de voir les joueurs de la NBA, certains athltes, certains nageurs, les haltrophiles, certains footballeurs qui ont doubl de volume lorsqu'ils ont intgr certaines quipes...    Le cyclisme, en particulier en France, est l'un des sports qui est le plus surveill depuis 2 ans (Landis, Rasmussen...). Si on trouve, c'est qu'on se donne les moyens de chercher.    Il y aura toujours des tricheurs qui passeront  la trappe, mais c'est dans tous les sports.|`|TPiDqgWAaa	Il y a des contr?les anti-dopage aprs chaque match de foot dans les grandes comptitions je te signale.

Se a ido este a?o porque Memphis ya no tiene objetivo para esta temporada y traspasando a Gasol se quitan su sueldo de encima.Ahora Memphis quiere hacer un equipo empezando de cero alrededor de Rudy Gay y para eso se necesita dinero y una forma de conseguirlo es librandose de los salarios mas altos como el de Gasol.  Espero haber respondido a tu pregunta.|`|Hs5iSCv2aa	Gasol ha salido elegido como el mejor jugador grizzlie de la historia , con el ivan antepenultimos, despues de que se haya ido llevan 2 victorias y 15 derrotas , con el solian conseguir 3 victorias ,5derrotas, por eso no lo querian vender,y ahora se demuestra que es uno de los mejores jugadores del mundo?por que no decirlo??quien es mejor que el?Kobe ,Lebron James y algun otro ,pero el esta entre los 6 o 7 mejores,ya que no solo es lo bueno que es , sino que su furia es transmitida al resto del equipo que juega con mas tension....espero averte servido de ayuda.|`|PLNu7AHyaa	8 a?os .. joer parece que fue hace nada ya lleva 8 a?os ...|`|HazsEWh7aa	je, estaran reflexionando.

Au niveau administratif galement, M. Guy Roux a voulu rvolutionner certaines choses, mme les invitations ne pouvaient plus tre gres comme il y a encore 3 ou 4 mois.  Tout cela a fait que Guy Roux (outre le fait qu'il se dit fatigu et ne plus avoir la gnac) s'est bien rendu compte qu'il n'arriverait pas  imposer sa fa?on d'agir comme  Auxerre, que certaines personnes du club n'accepteraient pas la remise en cause de leurs  et je pense que c'est ce qui a motiv sa dmission.  La vrit vraie nous ne la conna?trons peut-tre jamais, qui a raison dans la fa?on de procder d'un club jamais non plus sans doute.

Gerets a dclar qu'il ne ferait pas la mme erreur que l'anne dernire, et que plut?t que la victoire, il cherchera surtout  tester son quipe et des joueurs.  Les matchs amicaux avant saison ne sont vraiment pas rvlateurs de quoi que ce soit. Il s'agit de premiers matchs, la forme des joueurs n'est pas au top, l'engagement est moins prsents, et il y a une multitude de changements dans le match pour tester plusieurs configurations tactiques.    Pour finir, je pense que Nantes a effectivement une quipe prometteuse et finira dans la 1ere partie du classement. Mais ce n'est pas par rapport aux rsultats des matchs amicaux qu'il faudra le voir. Les scores sont vraiment anecdotiques|`|18c0ff1099a844f616fd3c027deca456aa	c'est encore l'inter saison ... rappelons que vous tes descendu ... attendons le dbut du championnat  ...|`|9590bf84d0436b263c78612dbd67f0d4aa	Les matches d'intersaison ne sont pas une vrit.

L'arrt Bosman est pass par l emportant les meilleurs joueurs fran?ais  l'tranger, l'cart financier s'est creus entre la L1 et ses voisins europens et la France a manqu le wagon pour la rnovation de ses infrastructures sportives.|`|2331fa5034550a067eb332eee45bcbe0aa	Lyon n'a que faire d'impressionner ou de faire rver des personnes totalement jalouses de leur russite. Les lyonnais viennent d'emmagasiner en 8 ans 13 trophes (1 coupe de la Ligue, 6 trophes des champions et surtout 6 titres de champions de France). Pendant ce temps, qu'ont fait les marseillais et les stphanois? Pas grand chose.  Mme pas un seul titre. Alors trs franchement, il vaut mieux tre champion de France et ne faire rver que les supporters lyonnais que de faire rver toute la France et de se faire sortir par Carquefou en Coupe de France et le Zenith Saint Petesbourgh en Coupe de l'UEFA (qui soit dit en passant est quand mme plus faible que Manchester United).|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Je pense qu'ils en ont les moyens, puisque lors des grosses rencontres de championnat ils rpondent toujours prsent avec du jeu, des buts, et des rsultats. En poule de LDC on a aussi assist  quelques superbes matchs. Malheureusement, et je ne comprends pas pourquoi, ils semblent avoir un complexe  partir des phases  limination, en jouant dfensif, petit bras, presque sans ambition. Certes Manchester est un plus grand club et une plus grande quipe, mais c'est en pressant et en jouant haut que Lyon aurait pu, d'une, faire un grand match, de deux, avoir une chance de le remporter. Seulement ainsi Lyon nous fera rver, nous qui ne sommes pas Lyonnais.|`|mCJg30x1aa	videment que Lyon peut rver les fran?ais !

Deuximement, le fait qu'il y ait des poules n'avantage pas Lyon car  cause de cela, les 2, 3 voire 4 des championnats trangers jouent cette LDC alors qu'avant avec le systme  limination directe seuls les champions nationaux avaient le droit de disputer cette coupe. A la place, on avait les champions de Yougoslavie, Roumanie, Bulgarie, Autriche, Sude, etc donc c'tait plus facile de la gagner avant.  J'en veux pour preuve Marseille en 1993 qui n'a battu que le Milan AC en finale comme grand club europen pour gagner cette comptition, maintenant il faudrait en battre au moins 3 !

Ce que cela m'apporte : De pratiquer srieusement sans me prendre au srieux.     @ coucou  notre ami marocain  Anous20 puisque j'tais au Maroc le mois dernier et que je souhaitais rencontrer Sense? Sellam, mais que ce dernier tait trop occup ... Peut tre un autre jour ...    Bon je vais te mettre ce que je pratique :    Kemp? T?de : L'art ancien d'Okinawa, comprend Atemi Jutsu, l'art des coups frapps,  Tui Te l'art des saisies et des projections et le Kyush? Jitsu, l'art de travailler sur les points d'acupuncture.

Bu-Jutsu : cre par maitre Grard Baron, compilation de techniques efficaces enseigne aux membres de plusieurs polices  travers le monde.      Toreikan Budo : Cre par  Sense?

Judo avec feu Ma?tre Eku Michigami    Yawara : cole de Ju Juitsu cre par Ma?tre Okuyama qui tait disciple de Ma?tre Takeda et condisciple de O'Sense? Ueshiba. Issue de l'Aiki Jutsu.    Ta? Chi Chuan cole Yang, forme Ta?kokuken.    Je terminerai par une petite annecdote :    Il y a quelque temps,  la rentre, nous avions notre lot de dbutants. J'en avais remarqu un qui semblait plus  l'aise que les autres et  la fin du cours je lui ai demand ce qu'il avait pratiqu.  "J'ai fait 3 ans de Kick- boxing" m'a t'il rpondu.  "Ah oui, le Kick boxing, je connais, j'ai un peu pratiqu" lui ais-je dit.  Et l le gars se met  nous dtailler son entra?nement et les combats auxquels il avait particips.  J'coutais poliment.  Au bout d'un moment mon assistant l'a interrompu en lui disant " Ce que tu n'as pas compris, c'est que quand Kyoshi Grard t'a dit qu'il avait "un peu pratiqu", il est en fait 5e Dan de Kick!"  Stupeur de l'lve ...    Tout est relatif, n'est ce pas Albert !    @ Diallo82  Et il savait ce qu'il disait car il tait parfaitement au courant des manipulations et des mystifications qu'avait introduites son Ma?tre Ankho ITOSU.   C'est entre autre visible dans le "Karate Kyohan" page 17 ...  regardez bien les  DEUX manires de fermer le poing. Aujourd'hui il n'y en a plus qu'une d'enseigne en Karat ... et ce n'est pas la bonne.    @ minipouss trs heureux de savoir que tu t'clates sur les tatamis et que cela t'a simplifi la vie. J'espre avoir le grand plaisir de te rencontrer un de ces jours dans un Dojo.    @ ami Imoen, c'est SMILODON et pas slimodon, je ne me nourris pas de slimfast moi. A moins que tu n'aies un cheveu sur la plume ...    @ elrut  quand dans sa question on emploi le mot " lgitime" on se position en fonction de la lgislation donc du juridique. Si ta question est mal formule, ne t'en prends qu' toi mme si les rponses ne te conviennent pas. On a pas a essayer de deviner ce que tu veux dire, il y a un DICTIONNAIRE qui dfinit le sens des mots POUR TOUT LE MONDE et je ne pense pas que tu fasses exception.    @ Ixe C aider  progresser des pratiquantes qui ont ta modestie et ton acharnement est un rel plaisir. Comme je l'ai dj dit :  " Une Ceinture Noire, c'est une ceinture blanche qui n'a jamais abandonn"  avec un tel mental, tu es bien partie pour aller trs loin et ce sera un grand plaisir si je puis t'y aider    @ A toutes et  tous : Un profond RIZURE?  l'ami Danmc qui a su par sa question mettre en exergue la qualit des intervenants de ce forum.  Je suis tonn et trs agrablement surpris du niveau surtout MENTAL des participants. Le niveau technique n'est rien, il ne peut que s'amliorer quand on a de telles qualits de coeur et d'esprit. J'avais compris qu'il y avait des intervenants de grandes qualits mais l'ensemble des rponses est surprenant.  Vu ce niveau, je vais lancer une ide :  Que penseriez vous d'essayer de mettre au point une rencontre avec le maximum de participants possible de Q/R ( journe ou mme W.E.) dans le dojo de l'un ou l'une d'entre nous ou les plus avancs dmontreraient des techniques et des formes de leur cole et o nous pratiquerions tous ensembles, tous Arts Martiaux confondus?   L'avantage de le monter sur un W.E., c'est que 1 nous dormirions tous dans le Dojo donc nous sommes moins tributaires d'un horaire.  2 nous pourrions aprs les cours nous entretenir de nos pratiques respectives et changer "de la peau  la peau"  3 chacun d'entre nous ammnerait des provisions pour le W.E. mais non uniquement pour sa propre consommation, mais pour faire galement go?ter de sa cuisine  quelques autres.... avec des tupperwares tout est possible .*  J'attends vos rponses    @ Danmc    On peut effectivement attendre, mais  trop attendre, on ne part jamais ....

Il faut savoir porter les coups. j'avais dj pratiquer le karat par le pass et l j'ai retrouv mon premier coup de coeur.    jodo : le baton moyen est bien videmment trs utile pour garder son uke  distance. En plus des coups ports, il sert  faire des cls , des projections, ...    iai-do: en dehors de la beaut des mouvements, il est vrai que cet art amliore considrablement les dplacements.  Je n'oublie pas non plus que l'art de dgainer le sabre, c'est aussi tre efficace et rapide mais cela prend du temps    ken-jutsu : l'avantage c'est que l'on peut avoir une ide un peu plus rel du maniement du sabre puisqu'il peut y avoir contact.    tanbo-jutsu : j'aime beaucoup l'utilisation que l'on peut faire des batons court. tranglements, cls, projections, immobilisations au sol.  il est surtout plus discret que le jo et on peut toujours dire que c'est un manche pour marteau (lol)    Je me doute bien que tu connais dj la signification de toutes ces disciplines.    Ce que cela m'apporte, je me sens bien et je partage du temps avec des amis. Je considre le dojo comme ma seconde maison parfois mme la premire .    Samedi Sensei a fait la remarque que j'tais 5 jours semaine sur le tatamis. Pour tout te dire, je n'y avait pas vraiment fait attention.    Je regrette seulement qu'il n'y ai pas beaucoup de femme dans le dojo. C'est dommage mais je ne dsespre pas.    Et toi quel est ton parcours? Se serait bien de le savoir non?|`|3aNl4Acxaa	euh, coucou, donc!    je fais du jujitsu. J'ai fait deux ans de karat, mais mauvaise ambiance plus soucis perso, j'ai arret, un peu malgr moi.

Quand je vois qu'Essien a cout 36 M  Chelsea, je me dis que Nasri (et Ribery) ne sont pas vendus  leur juste valeur. Mais c'est peut-tre un arrangement pass avec les joueurs en change de bons et loyaux services.    Petite remarque : je trouve qu'effectivement, Nasri aurait pu attendre un peu, surtout aprs sa saison 08/09. Il avait le temps d'aller gagner plus en Angleterre. L'OM a un projet sportif interessant depuis 3-4 ans, et une anne avec Gerets et la meilleure quipe possible aurait t interessante  suivre.

vmKH1a2saa	Bonjour Laetifleur,    Le rugby s'est install dans les premires annes du 20me sicle  Bayonne (1904), Biarritz (1913), sans oublier Agen, Dax, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Tarbes et mme quelques clubs disparus des 2 plus grandes divisions francaises (Top 14 et Pro D2)...je pense  Lourdes, Saint Jean de Luz, Boucau-Tarnos, Mauleon, Tyrosse, Hagetmau, Soustons...et bien sur, j'en oublie...   Certains de ces clubs sont centenaires pour la plupart.  L'attractivit et la popularit du rugby, dans le sud-ouest, c'est une question de culture. L'aviron bayonnais devrait tre le premier club avec des socios, sur le modle du football espagnol, tant la popularit du club est grande. Et il est vrai qu'conomiquement, le rugby devient important en terme de reprsentation pour les entreprises (budgets entre 6 et 15M d'euros)  J'ai pu lire dans certains commentaires prcdents que la tauromachie tait trop prsente en Espagne pour que le rugby y soit reprsent. Je pense que vous faites fausse route, amha. Bayonne, Dax, St Sever, Mont de Marsan et autres sont aussi des places fortes de la corrida. Corrida et rugby sont lis.  Selon moi, le fait que le rugby soit si populaire dans le sud ouest et pas en espagne ne tient qu' un autre sport, synonyme de religion en Espagne, c'est le sport roi, le football. Certains se diront...lui, il a rien compris. Je vous dirai alors : comparez le budget du club de rugby de Bera bera ( Saint Sebastien) avec le budget de la Real Sociedad, club de football de San S...regardez les sommes enfloues dans le foot, que ce soit au Real Madrid, Valencia, FC Seville, Barcelone...et meme en seconde division, voire en seconde division B...  Pour connaitre les 2 sports et les 2 pays, rien  voir.   Il est normal que les passions soient diffrentes.     De plus, les sports de contact comme le rugby n'auraient pas la mme aficion en espagne...on aime pas se frotter, se cogner sur la pninsule ibrique...encore que j'ai pu assister  de belles bagarres en basket, hand ou foot...mais rien  voir avec le rugby, sport dans lequel il s'agit de se rentrer dedans, de se faire mal  chaque fois, pour soi et son quipe.    Jean-Michel  webmaster d'euskadisport.com|`|D7OFstJzaa	Merci Millouz, j'ai appris quelquechose grace  toi.  Quant  Toto et Draz, vous n'avez pas l'air assez intelligents pour savoir que les corridas ne sont pas rserves aux seuls espagnols.

Draz, toi qui te rjouis de ce genre d'accident et qui en es  souhaiter la mort d'un homme, ne viens pas sur ce forum nous parler de la corrida stp, un peu de discrtion quand on a des oeillres et aucune culture ne fait pas de mal.

9it4bL16aa	La France a dmontre de belles choses et  voir la facilit dont elle a battu par deux fois l'Angleterre il y a des raisons de se rjouire.  Cependant cela reste des matchs de prparation, la coupe du monde c'est diffrent, la volont des autres quipes sera diffrente.  J'ai bonne fois pourtant  Mais l'quipe qui me fais le plus peur c'est l'Afrique du Sud. Trs solide  l'avant et rapide  l'arrire, quipe complte mais qui possde une important "fighting spirit"   ce qui n'est pas le cas des nozlandais aprs leur victoire au tri-nations, ils se sont reposs, aucun match amical, pas d'esprit combatif, ils se masturbent entre eux car ils pensent avoir dj gagner la coupe du monde mais ils se feront descendre en 1/4 nde finale par les irlandais ou l'argentine j'en suis s?r, ils vont pcher par excs de confiance.  Quant  l'Australie, ils savent plus jouer au rugby, malheureusement pour eux ils n'ont pas encore eu de changement de gnration depuis la dernire coupe du monde, contrairement aux autres quipes, ils sont vieillissants et sans fra?cheur.

Je mise sur un des deux.|`|D7OFstJzaa	nicodal del vince 8: dsol, mais la France et la Nouvelle-Zlande ne peuvent se rencontrer qu'en 1/4 ou en finale.   Si les 2 quipes finissent premires de leur poule, ce ne peut tre qu'en finale.  Je ne sais pas o tu as vu qu'on les jouait en 1/2, mais le tableau que tu as mis en lien dans une de tes rponses confirme bien ce que je dis...    Sinon, aprs 1 mois et demi de comptition, en finale devant son public, notre XV national peut renverser des montagnes, fussent-elles blacks...

Sinon croire en quelque chose de faux, ce n'est pas de la mythomanie, sinon ?a revient  dire que les gens qui croient en Dieu sont des mythomanes. De plus je te ferai remarqu, qu'aucun supporter de l'OM ne parle du titre et tous s'accordent  dire que l'objectif raisonnable est la 3e place. Il n'y a que les mdias qui s'enflamment tout seul.

Ce sont encore de jeunes internationaux, aucun ne se vexera de se retrouver sur la touche.  Mexs pour moi il joue  droite de la dfense et nulle part ailleurs. Je vois vraiment pas pourquoi Domenech s'obstine  interchanger Mexs et Gallas entre le poste en club et en slection.  Abidal a fait un excellent match face  la Serbie alors que Gallas ?a fait un moment qu'on ne le voit plus  son meilleur niveau.  Entre Clichy et Evra ?a se discute, l'un comme l'autre sont bons mais l'impression laisse par Clichy lors de sa premire slection face  la Serbie pse dans la balance.  Vieira c'est le pilier de l'quipe dans le jeu mais aussi dans l'humain et surtout il va apporter cette capacit  se porter vers l'avant que n'ont ni Toulalan ni Diarra.  Ribry  droite en l'absence de Govou mais il est vident que je le prfre  gauche comme au Bayern mme si Malouda fait un excellent dbut de saison  Chelsea et mrite (enfin !) sa slection.  Gourcuff est au mon avis la meilleure option si on joue avec un meneur. Athltique, dou technique, intelligent dans le jeu et le rythme.  Devant c'est compliqu d'envoyer Henry sur le banc mais faut avouer que Anelka reste sur un excellent match face  la Serbie et un dbut de saison canon avec Chelsea o Scolari l'a relanc dans un r?le de buteur.  Je pense que renvoyer Gallas et Henry peut aussi crer un lectrochoc et entrainer une remise en question de certains.|`|LQgaxwR7aa	Lloris  Sagna - Gallas - Mexes - Clichy           Vieira - Toulalan   Ribery - Gourcuff - Malouda                Benzema|`|Z3kXbI2haa	Comme toi, mis  part Abidal, je sais pas trop par rapport  Mexs.

Du point de vue de Henry, je pense qu'il dsire gagner une ligue des champions avant tout. Mais, ayant pass 7ans en Angleterre je ne le crois pas assez technique ni subtil pour cotoyer des gars comme Deco, Inesta, Xavi, Messi, Ronaldinho ou Eto'o qui combinent comme jamais on a combin sur un terrain de foot auparavant. La balle va  200  l'heure avec eux.  Peut-tre qu'il se sera adapt au jeu rapide de Barcelone pendant l'absence d'Eto'o.

q9v26B6Vaa	I have to disagree.  Pettite is a proven fantasy player while Meche is streaky at best. Pettite plays for a team that will give him much more run support than Meche.  And Pettite will give you more trade potential than Meche ever would, should you try to package him in some sort of deal (which may be your best bet).  Pettite didn't take a nose dive in just one season.  I'd hold onto him and wait for him to get going (or try trading him now if you are still leary of him).  There is a reason Pettite was drafted and Meche is still on the waivers. Pettite over Meche.|`|BLrF5rU6aa	No. Andy Pettitte is probably the best Yankees pitcher. The team gives him run support so he'll get you wins. He often doesn't give up many runs, which helps your ERA.

En France , tous les joueurs de la premire srie et 90% des -30 battent Justine Hnin.  Moi-mme, je suis 15/1 et je perds  l'entra?nement contre des 15/5 ou 30 masculins.

Au plan international, cela reprsente peut-tre la 10'000... 15'000'... 20'000eme place ?!?!    Je crois aussi qu'il ne faut pas se leurrer, les matchs fminins sont beaucoup moins intenses physiquement.

128bf9fcd413034a0bc34bd612cd2e70aa	i understand your frustration. I am watching the game right now and its inconceivable to me how GS keeps getting away with technical after technical and flagrant after flagrant while the suns have two star players suspended because of making three strides onto the court. The NBA is doing a great job of ruining an unbelievable playoff series and its getting to a point of sheer ridiculousness. If you look at the eastern conference though you won't find that sort of behavior at all. MAKES YOU THINK. By the way the only reason the best team in the NBA this year Dallas didnt make it by GS is because they dont play like thugs and because their MVP is a calm and cool player, oh right but lets reward the thugery and continue cheering for those spurs and warriors.|`|AA12062562	"getting away with" techs and flagrants? they're not getting away with them if they're getting called. Utah is getting away with fouls, reaches, and Boozer slamming into people and getting the call. i see how you can call GS thugs, but that doesn't mean they should get cheated out of calls.|`|a5EB1taoaa	I completely agree, in fact you are amazing, I'm watching game 5 and the technicals are mounting. I'm sorry if your a gs fan, but their team is a bunch of WANNA BE thugs. the biggest poor sports Ive seen. but i guess that's what you get when you bring Stephen Jackson on your team. he not only sucks. but he'll bring your team down with him.|`|4HvNHkI0aa	They just dun have the luck .....so what can they do ??|`|AA11835896	The Warriors play with a lot of heart and they let it get to them sometimes. In case and point the flagrant foul by Richardson you don't do that in a playoff contest with your team going to win. Davis had an awesome dunk big deal he lifted his shirt up. The Warriors are a team when playing beautiful and making shots they're one of the toughest teams to play. They have talent and they play with heart and thats more then what other teams can say.|`|291d6375abe5e8caafaf745fa606ea55aa	what you talkin about golden states team is good to watch up and down back and forth b. diddy is sick all these fueds are showing teams really want it this year emotions are running high if ur team aint emotional get off the court your not winning im a celts fan and im wishing i had a team of golden states calibur cuz they could advance they just blew it last game wit free throws|`|PhkmXM7paa	the pistons of the 80's were pretty bad, and the league has gotten more paranoid since the fight w/ artest, but it still doesn't excuse the behavior of stephen jackson and the rest of the head cases on the warriors...|`|NmThT9yraa	We Believe!!!|`|c4945703897699a06e7537baffebe49caa	Like the Warriors, but you have to learn how to win as well as lose.  Roster full of head cases though.|`|qUlyDE5Aaa	The Warriors are an emotional team that loses it's cool at times.  Their players overreact to calls and have a lot of pride, and that tends to get them in trouble.  But that high emotion is also what makes the team as good as it is too.    It's obviously a team that doesn't have enough inside players, but can run with the best of them.  They play pressing defense and run a fastbreak offense, but don't stand much of a chance in the halfcourt sets.  They rely on 3's way too much, but somehow they find a way to win.    They've had a 13 year drought from the playoffs!  They are the underdog dream that every league needs.  You can't just have the teams with the best players win all the time.  You have to have some surprises!  And Golden State was a nice surprise.    Yes, they could have handled their behavior and tempers better, but overall a team like the Warriors is a breathe of fresh air to the NBA.  It lets everyone know that even a team like Golden State has a chance to win, and that helps to keep the game exciting.    Go Warriors!|`|AA11668458	Go Warriors!!!!

ARCRA2BYaa	I think you have a really good team top to bottom.  I'm wondering why you're not starting Wells over Jr. or Johnson right now?  That's not important though.  You could improve you're pitching a bit more and then you're team would be pretty hard to beat.|`|nWEbqV5Raa	why are you not starting vernon wells and and orlando hudson, i dont know?|`|YKJQKsQqaa	you need better pitching................. and where is A-Rod in your line up.............|`|q9v26B6Vaa	Looks like you've got some solid batting there at the core in Pujols, Cabrera, Rollins, Morneau and Wells.  You OF could use a little help, along with catcher, though catcher is a secondary focus.  As for pitching, no big names there.  Your batting can get you through but your pitching won't.  I think Marquis and Penny (possibly Gorzelanny and Lilly too) are great "sell-high" pitchers.  Penny is notorious for getting off to a fast start and Marquis has never done this well in his career and should hit a wall soon.  I think you should try to trade these pitchers for other consistent pitchers instead.  Adding  another closer wouldn't hurt (maybe try the waiver wires).  I'd address your pitching first, and then if you have room to do so, boost your outfield and maybe even catcher.  Good luck to ya!|`|g2XyepnHaa	Either play Wells, or trade him for a solid, proven closer. I would not depend on Al Reyes for my Saves all year.

KVfLCs3Yaa	C'est une bonne question!    Il doit y avoir certainement une forme d'arrogance.     En Suisse, beaucoup des gens regardent les matches de la France dans tous les sports confondus uniquement dans le but de les voir perdre. Le plaisir vient uniquement de voir les fran?ais ne pas pouvoir s'autocongratuler.    Pour ma part, je ne souhaite pas la victoire de la France en  Rugby, pourtant je suis fran?ais (double national).    Je tenais encore pour la France en 98 mais ce chauvinisme exacerb m'a pes. Je me range maintenant  du c?t des autres suisses et me fait un plaisir de voir perdre les quipes fran?aises.    Parce que autant les mdias fran?ais sont exagrment fiers quand ils gagnent autant il est jouissif de les voir souffrir quand il perdent. (comme contre l'cosse). Les supporters ne sont  mon avis pas en cause.    Juste un mot sur les commentaires...Je constate que la plupart des rponses s'tonnent que quelqu'un poste une question sur l'arrogance, comme s'il ne la remarquait pas. C'est peut tre la rponse  la question...On ne remarque mme plus notre arrogance.|`|Hh7d4ATJaa	Quelle arrogance ?|`|NLCai8iRaa	Supporters forts chauvins!!!!!!!

Edit pour christ-agns77: dommage que  les fran?ais prechent le fair play quand ils gagnent, mais alors quand ils perdent... ?a suffisait de lire les journaux le landemain du match d'ouverture pour voir le fair play fran?ais, et ?a n'est que l'exemple le plus rcent...|`|84b995e83523f27485fe1d2e2a3498d5aa	C'est une question d'idiot ou d'aigri?|`|zA2UFjFcaa	max et DM relax on parle de sport l pas de dcouvertes mdicales ou industrielles vitales pour la plante , il faut relativiser, encore une petite chose DM je suis supportrice de rugby depuis que je suis enfant  l'poque de Rives Gallion and co  ce n'est pas d'hier , pour le foot je te l'accorde beaucoup de femmes ne supportent pas le foot quand leurs maris regardent mais c'est pareil lorsqu'elles ont soutenu en 98 et 2006 c'est le symbole du pays qu'elles soutenaient , la joie d'un exploit accompli .........    ne soyez pas aigris soyez juste contents et fair play|`|VM7vcwrraa	Il me semble que c'est l'humilit francaise qui a permis la victoire des bleus contre l'arrogance NZ.

XrZbqY4Vaa	The training required to ride as a professional, making your living on two wheels, is no big secret. Its an awful lot  somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000km of riding per annum.   (ref: http://www.pponline.co.uk/encyc/interval...     Using 30,000 km per year, this equates to about 82 km per day or 575 km per week    Therefore I think that 750 km per week for a top cyclist is probably about correct.    At an average speed of 30 kph that means that they spend about 3 hours a day training whilst top performers spend about  3.5 hrs per day training|`|385UkmgWaa	Cyclists don't get paid by the hour, they get paid to perform as best they can. They train the needed hours to be in top condition. The training time varies widely depending on the time of year. The most training time ocurres pre-season, when they are building up base conditioning to the hard training needed to compete. During the race season training time goes down as race time goes up. An athlete's body can only handle so much training time. Over training is as bad as under training. Their job as a cyclist is more than just riding.|`|xqxBe9VQaa	idk a lot

aQuZMaPsaa	Veras, el salto longitudinal es el salto de longitud, se realiza en un foso (especie de caja de arena) y consiste en correr por la pista y saltar antes de llegar a una marca, si apsas de esta ser nulo.    |`|QPQog7DHaa	Hay distintas disciplinas atleticas de saltos algunas son de longitud (salto en largo, salto triple) y otras en altura (salto en alto, salto con garrocha).|`|cmI27Xeeaa	giro hacia adelante,|`|jiZ6hTieaa	salto en largo|`|TsafXayCaa	ES EL SALTO DE LONGITUD    Salto de longitud es una prueba del actual atletismo consistente en recorrer la mxima distancia posible en el plano horizontal a partir de un salto tras una carrera. La carrera previa debe realizarse dentro de un rea existente para ello, que finaliza en una tabla de batida que indica el punto lmite para realizar el impulso. La cada tiene lugar sobre un foso de arena. La distancia del salto se mide desde la tabla de batida hasta la marca ms retrasada sobre la arena hecha por cualquier parte del cuerpo del atleta, y consta de cuatro partes: carrera, impulso, vuelo y cada.    Los competidores realizan tres saltos cada uno y los ocho mejores pasan a la siguiente ronda de otros tres saltos. Siempre se tiene en cuenta el salto ms largo. En caso de empate ganar, entre los dos atletas, el que haya realizado el segundo salto ms largo.    Es prueba olmpica en la categora masculina desde su primera edicin celebrada en Atenas en 1896. La categora femenina de la prueba debut en los Juegos celebrados en Londres en 1948.

oi66N5QYaa	If the ball is caught before it touches the ground, the batter is out.    It is optional but also advisable to run.  Why?  Because the batter may have a chance to reach base due to a fielding error, in which case, the team has an improved chance to score a run.  That said, if a batter hits the ball and chooses not to run, he will, no doubt, find himself highly unpopular with the rest of the team, and will likely not play for the team much longer.|`|faj1ELwLaa	WHAT KIND OF IDIOT ARE YOU?????????? YOU MUST NOT BE AMERICAN |`|ywYRId6maa	If the fielder catches a line drive or pop up before it touches the ground then the batter is out.

ycCKmAiBaa	The whole point is your kid is enjoying what they do, not whether or not you think they look foolish.  The fact that she is involved in the sport means she's not lazy, otherwise she'd be at home on the couch.  Always encourage her to do her best, but please don't become a sports mom where you expect the world of them, that usually is discouraging to a kid anyway.  Just figure, the more she practices, the more she'll play, and the more she plays, the better she'll get..  And if you want to help her, just have fun and play some basketball with her, the practice always helps and its quality time for you and her.. |`|V89ZS1tIaa	Some young girls don't have the aggression in them for basketball and truly don't like the closeness of the opposing team.  If she likes playing sports, maybe basketball isn't the one for her and that's OK.

Acting, music, dancing, etc. Maybe she has an interest you don't know about.|`|IMzza26Aaa	My rule of thumb was always that my child needed to put the effort in at practice and if he didn't the coach wouldn't play him much anyway, however since she is only 10 and this at least is a form of exercise I wouldn't push it further.  As she gets older if she still participates in group sports the coaches will notice the lack of effort and she will either get cut or not get played much.  Sometimes it can be a good lesson that they have to learn on their own.|`|zPVftEmKaa	Your child your decision|`|85JJfTgBaa	ask her if she wants to play.    it sound like she doesnt want to play. Or may be her friends are doing it.|`|GZ2ROSEHaa	I may be a little young to give parenting advice, but as an athlete, I think you should let her play if thats what she really wants.  She's only 10, so at that age its just fun to play basketball, who cares if she looks like a fool.    If she's having fun and likes it, let her keep playing.  You don't want to discourage her at this age, for all you know she could turn out to be a pretty good ball player when she gets older and matures a bit.  Just give it time and let her have fun.

vN7hzs0taa	Sting,Nash etc are in NWA TNA|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	Many went to the WWE in the invasion angle but some big stars were contracted to Ted Turners company instead of just WCW so when the WWE bought WCW they didn't own contracts for certain stars. Some are in TNA, some still with the WWE and some are now retired since WCW ended nearly a decade ago. just google the ones you want to know about to find out what they are up to these days. WCW closed due to a few reasons. Booking was driving away fans, sometimes wrestlers didn't know what they where doing for the nights show ten minutes before the show went out live. Another reason was Ted Turners open cheque book policy, anyone could ask for more money or they would leave and they got it. Top stars were on so much money the passion almost left them so they didn't bust there gut for a good show. If you go to youtube and search for WWE confidential, there is a few videos of people involved with WCW talking about why the company died.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	diamond dallas page left wcw was working for the wwe for a while he did an angle with the undertaker  only a short angle then his contract with the wwe ended and now i think he is home with his wife.<br>  keven nash was also in  the wwe you might off remember him in the new world order with scott hall xpac  he had a rival with triple h while triple h was with evolution at the time but keven nash contract expired and he is not part off tna in the man event Mafia involving booker t stine kurt angle and scott Steiner. i believe wcw close down due to not having the money to keep up and went in to a story line with the wwf where it was the wwf vs team wcw and ecw and wwf won that but i think it was something to do with money .|`|q2AsDnjpaa	Ted Turner wasn't making any money.

Turner was on the board of Time Warner and Ted Turner was out voted when AOL wanted to merge with Time Warner. So, when the merger happend AOL/Time Warner board bought Ted Turner out of power. With Turner no longer in power WCW was rutterless ad Trner was WCW's biggest supporter and fan. AOL/TW no longer wanted to run a wrestling company. AOL thought Wrestling was bad for their image. This is why WCW was privately put up for sale. WCW had to groups of investers trying to buy WCW from AOL/TW. There was Eric Bischoffs goup and Jerry Jarretts group. Eric Biscoffs group amost had a done deal when AOL/TW said that neither TNT or TBS would continue broadcasting WCW in an effort to also clean up their image. <br>  Bischoff was furious and tried to get a deal in place with the FOX network but couldnt swing both deals and thus backed away as too Jrry Jarrett. Now there was nobody bidding on WCW. TILL Vince came along and purchased the company for somewhere between 7 and 15 million dollars. Vince did this only because he wanted the HUGE WCW video library which was even bigger than WWE's at the time. Now Vince had it all and could easily earn back his 7 to 15mill in video sales alone in a year or two. <br>  <br>  Also included in the WCW deal was the name WCW, Images, about 25% of the WCW roster mostly low paid young talent like Booker T, Hugh Morris, DDP, Helms, Mysterio, Kidman, Kanyon, The Wall, Noble, torrie wilson, stacy keibler, buff bagwell, the natural born thrillers and a few others. <br>  <br>  Nash, Hogan, Goldberg, Sting, Flair, Stiener all were wanted by the WWE but they all had MEGA contracts that paid them millions more than the highest paid WWE guys and Vince wouldnt bring them in at that price so they chose to sit at home and just collect their pay checks till their WCW deals ran out. Once those deals ran out they slowly made their way to the WWE but by that time the WWE's invasion angle had been so screwed by lack of star power and poor writing and lack of ideas that the WWE thought bringing the NWO back in a new invasion angle would be cool. However, the WWE version of the NWO was a horrible flop even with Vince pushing it hardcore and teaming Hogan, Nash and Hall back together. <br>  <br>  How Ironic was it that what took WCW over the top was a Hogan heel turn and the formation of the NWO and what boosted WWE after two major storyline flops was the face turn of Hogan going back to his yellow and red hulkamaniacs and taking on a heel ROCK at mania. <br>  <br>  Vince still wanted Sting in WWE but Sting has seen many ex WCW and even today x TNA stars go to WWE and get burried. He is affraid Vince will not treat him with the respect he deserves. Sting not being in the WWE is a very touchy subject for Vince as well as Sting is actually one of Vinces all time favorite performers. Sting has said he never wants to wrestle for Vince McMahon but there is one  guy in the WWE that he does want to wrestle and that is the Undertaker. <br>  <br>  Lastly, the Jerry Jarrett group that wanted to buy WCW ended up staring TNA which was later sold to Robert Carter for $250,000. Mr. Carter was asked to buy the company on behalf of his daughter Dixie who was working for the company. She was then promoted from head of marketing to CEO of TNA and Panda Energy which is another company owned by the Carters sent a hand full of top executives to TNA to help Dixie run the company. Executives who have experiece running multi million dollar companies. Jeff Jarrett who still owns a share of TNA was made VP of TNA and head of Creative. Basically Dixie runs the business side of the company and Jeff Jarrett runs the wrestling side.

Z5xgSATSaa	Generally speaking, you should not do big upgrades above the general level of components your bike came with. You can't turn a $500 bike into the equivalent of a $2000 bike by upgrading some parts. If your bike came with a 7 speed shifting system, upgrading to 9 speed is going to be an expensive proposition, not at all cost effective. Rather than upgrading shifters, think about things like tires, even wheels, which will give you much more bang for your dollars spent. High end components will do fine for commuting, mountain bike racing involves parts working reliably in extreme conditions, commuting is not nearly as hard on parts. If you are riding almost exclusively on the road, a set of tires for road use is the best upgrade you can make, perhaps you could try to modify your position to a more aerodynamic one to be able to move faster on the road.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	you can spend as much as you want! upgrades are not just for performance. also for wiehgt saveings, reliablitydepends on what you have now for bike frame and components? if you have a walmart bike don't upgrd just buy new. deore-lx is good reliable, quality, save some weight. but it's the rest of the parts and frame where you knock off the most weight. my commuter bike has full xt but i've had this bike for 16yrs.for commute "xtr" is too expensive.|`|TEX1iYQgaa	If the XTR stuff can withstand the rigors of racing, it will certainly hold up to everyday commuting. The problem with XTR components is that they are very expensive. If you can afford it, then go for it. However, the Shimano Deore XT components work great, and so do the Deore LX, and they don't cost near as much.<br>  <br>  You can also go with SRAM components. The X-0 series stuff is their top of the line components, and they're going to be a bit pricey. But the X-9 and the X-7 groups work great, and would be an affordable way to go as well.<br>  <br>  If it were me, I wouldn't want anything less than the models I mentioned.|`|APnVzUUFaa	There is no reason to use XTR components for commuting, unless you are worried about getting to work 3.7 seconds faster. Save your dough, and buy your choice of  50 tires, 300 tubes, a trailer with a complete tool kit and refrigerator etc. Even the lowest level components will be able to handle the riding you are doing if they are properly maintained, but if you want to feel like you have a little higher quality, choose something one step up from the bottom group ( like Deore LX ). The most important thing about components is whether they are adjusted correctly. Higher end components are mainly designed to be lighter, sometimes they are more durable but usually they will last the same length as low-end ones. Most riders, if they were blind-folded, would not be able to tell the difference between component groups either in functionality or speed.<br>  <br>  Using XTR would be like buying a Ferrari ( or a Lexus... since we're comparing Shimano ) to go get your groceries with. Not the smartest way to spend your money.|`|Thd7Vczfaa	well.  I bought a bike at target four years ago and ride it to work all time.  still works great.  maintain rather than upgrade|`|J1Frx83haa	46498464 dollars|`|EWZiWnAIaa	mtbiker is spot on. You should upgrade the cost effective parts of the bike and find a cheap supplier.<br>  I came across a website that has what seems to be ridiculous prices on parts. They're called velogear and may be worth a shot- they sometimes do free insurance and free freight and stuff like that.

590d986c154177f203af5c07705cda21aa	As a United fan I'm gonna go with them, oh and the fact that they've won the last 2 premier league titles, defending European Cup champions and are currently 1st in the premier league, in the CC final, the FA CUP qtrs, and the last 16 of the CL. Arsenal on the other hand have some future superstars and not much else.

tY3rZSsiaa	yea when they traded billups away, i expected them to fall to the bottom of the playoff race.  a real team like the pistons just cant work with a guy like ai.  plus, they traded away the guy who ran that team and kept them together.  theyre just building up cap space anyway and wanted to experiment with ai, since they figured they were not going to win with the team they had at the start of the season.|`|cNIQ9xs6aa	They're headed for the LOTTERY........The trade (Iverson for Billups) was a message to the team. They weren't going to go far in the playoffs with the same team for the last five years so make the trade and either they go deep into the playoffs or they have a good draft pick and they clear $14-21 million if they don't sign Iverson and R Wallace. So they get younger and they have a ton of money for the Free Agent Market.|`|qq1fSV2daa	yeh have absolutely no team chemistry .. Iverson is taking way too many bad shots and their best player (Hamilton) isn't even starting .. i still think they'll make the playoffs .. maybe in the 7th or 8th seed but they wont make it out of the 1st round|`|vzH7f7V5aa	The Trash Can.|`|TYJ5IKILaa	To the crapper...<br>  Most of the players are getting older, who knows how many years A.I. has left.<br>  Personally I love A.I., but he's more of a scorer than a play maker, and every NBA fan knows that.<br>  Rasheed Wallace is getting older, and they don't have any good big men.<br>  Sure they have Rip and Tayshaun, but if I'm not wrong, I think they have at least 7 years on their belt each.<br>  If the Pistons don't do anything in the next year or two to get some younger players they're done.<br>  I say they'll make the playoffs this year and next year around a 6-8 seeds, but two years, A.I. or Rasheed will probably retire, and they'll be done.|`|10cf11353637f66f677c0fd0697091b7aa	No where. it pisses me off i'm a huge pistons fan. I was sad when we lost Chauncey but AI is a big plus. They just cant find chemistry. They need to fire curry and get a new coach. Thats one of there biggest problems i think.|`|goe3y4FPaa	EVER SINCE THEY LOST BEN WALLACE.. AND ITS NOT RASHEED WALLACE, HAMILTON AND BEN.. THEY HIT ROCK BOTTOM..  IF THEY HAD THE GRANT HILL.. THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.. LIKE IN THE EARLY 90'S + BEN AND HAMILTON AND WALLACE.. THEY WOULD BE WINNING CHAMPIONSHIPS.. FO SHO|`|h9ZRYMWzaa	I think the pistons are done being a dominate team in the east. they bassically shot themeselves in the foot with the chauncy billups trade|`|NHAKOXyXaa	theyll be somewhere around 5th 6th 7th 8th seed. i think the pistons are still going to the conference finals, the pistons core is too good they should fix this slump soon.|`|qWI3XBnCaa	LOTTERY|`|GswnLKtQaa	7th straight losing streak, if they continue this they'll miss the playoffs. it's only 3-4 games that separate the #7 to # 10 teams in the east.|`|i5MInqeMaa	All teams have to come down sooner or later.  Pitsons have been on top of the East for the last 5 or 6 years.  I think last year losing to the Cavs in the playoffs was a good indication that they are headed for mediocrity.  This team is not very good and will be headed for an 8th seed if their lucky.

VJ1C5JsYaa	Well Im also from mass like the first guy and I like loon also. Its a large mountain and have a wide variety of trails to choose from. They offer two type of lessons at loon(I remember from when I took them lol). The first is group lessons which are fairly cheap and not to bad. Its about 6-10 people per group and I think its $50 for 3 hours or so. The other type is the private lesson. You can go alone or with a group of up to 4. Its $200 flat rate whether you have 1 or 4. The lesson is 2-3 hours long but its personal and very good. There is no true best snowboard just one that you like and suits you. To take care of it you make sure it gets waxed and sharpened when it need to.|`|CqB5ryTFaa	I live in Mass and i love going to Loon in NH but there are some many good mountains that all have good instructors in NH about anywhere. I like Sunapee a lot too. If you have the money I would go to your local board shop and talk to someone who works there about different boards and which would be right for you.  Have them take out a few choices and decide what you think would fit you best.  Taking care of snowboard is pretty easy wax it a few times season and get the edges sharpened after each season and after you go riding make sure your board is dry when you store it at home so the edges don't rust.  Warning snowboarding is an expensive sport but is soooooo much fun. Good Luck with it.|`|HVpeJzM4aa	because i'm from the westcoast i'll only answer question 4,5, and some xtras...:<br>  <br>  best type of snowboard depends on type of riding...so far based on reviews K2's are the best all around board, I've heard great things about GNU and Lib Tech, as well as Ride.<br>  <br>  5. Wax it frequently, and sharpen the edges<br>  <br>  if you're going to buy a setup, make sure you buy the boots, first, then bindings, then board.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to anyones advice about which bindings to go with...flows, or strap ins...it's depending on the user. Unlike most people who hate on flows, i've actually used both and there's nothing wrong with flows except that it's easier to get into and you don't have to sit down while putting them on. Lastly...if you go to a boardshop and the first question isn't "what type of riding do you do, and how much do you weigh" then leave the store or ask for someone who has some knowledge. Oh, and p.s. avoid burton for EVERYTHING...trust me in the long run you'll find out why.
