The 'bill' part just refers to it being a 'bill' in Congress, which has to be passed in order for it to take effect.|`|x97ktCqwaa	It is money that we need that the Federal Reserve (As federal as Federal Express...it is a Private bank) creates out of thin air and then asks for interest on it from the Government (against what the Constitution states that Congress should control the money).    The "Stimulus" that is going around right now is nothing more than bloating government programs which are already in existence.  It will not "Stimulate" anything except MORE dept.

However, Israel is the one that controls 95% of the border, including all of Gaza's waterways. How is it Palestinian land if they can't even receive aid or conduct foreign trade on their own waters?    The Rafah crossing should be opened, and I think it is sickening what Mubarek has done. However, Israel is the one that has imposed the humanitarian siege along the vast majority of the border.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	No one should be pressured into helping or aiding a country they want nothing to do with.

How can you measure their IQ using western educational standards when these people live very educationally deprived lives?  If you ask a Bushman an IQ test question such as "car is to driver as horse is to ?  How is a Bushman going to know the answer (rider) if he has never seen or driven a car, or even seen a horse and rider? Get the point?  Now, you take a baby Bushman and put him in a western society and give him an education, then he should be able take an IQ test accurately.    But to answer your question, I don't know who of the two has a higher IQ because where is their IQ test results?  Of course, they are both American educated so the test would be fair to compare both of them.    Having said all this, I think it is more important to measure a person's accomplishments and learning abilities, and not his/her IQs.  IQ's may give you an idea of the person's intelligence, allowing for culturally and educational differences.   Mensa people have high IQs and can do puzzles well, but doing puzzles is no accomplishment.  In this respect, I think Mensa is a joke.        Also, a person could be very smart in say, math, but only average in other ways.  Think Einstein...he was a genius in math and physics, but overall he did poor in school and I don't think his overall IQ test results were good (except for math).

We have been taken aback by the level of your response. Thank you, it means so much to us. If you havent had a response yet, please dont worry  someone from the team will be in touch shortly.     If you gave a statement to anyone during the course of the investigation into Madeleines abduction, wed be really grateful if you could contact us so that we can follow up every last piece of information.    Our daughter Madeleine was abducted on 3rd May 2007 in Praia da Luz, Portugal, 9 days before her 4th birthday. She was taken from our holiday apartment where she was sleeping with her younger brother and sister whilst we were dining 50 yards away. Despite a massive investigation led by the Portuguese police and supported by the British police, we still do not know who has taken her, why she was taken or where she is. In addition, private investigators based in Spain are now following up any leads regarding Madeleines disappearance. (Investigation page)    Since Madeleines abduction, we have learned a lot about missing children and child exploitation. The scale of the problem is massive and worldwide. Although finding Madeleine will always remain our priority, we feel it is our duty to highlight these problems as well as areas where legislation can be improved, in order to make the world a little safer for all children. To achieve these aims we are working closely with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Centre for Child Exploitation and Online Protection and other non-governmental agencies throughout Europe (Investigation page). The Find Madeleine Campaign launched a new YouTube channel for missing children in August 2007 called Dont You Forget About Me in conjunction with ICMEC and Google.    The support we have had from around the world has been amazing. We have no doubt that without all the good wishes, prayers and efforts of so many people, our ordeal would have been so much harder. It has helped maintain our strength and hope, and this together with support for the campaign, has helped the search for our precious Madeleine. We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their unconditional support and solidarity.    Madeleine is a beautiful little person. She was a very happy and much loved little girl. We believe there is a very good chance that Madeleine is still alive. She deserves the love and security of her family. She needs to be back home with her mummy and daddy, brother and sister.    Please keep Madeleine in your thoughts and prayers. And please  remain vigilant.    We will NEVER give up looking for Madeleine.    Thank you again for your ongoing support and kindness|`|xdUjRxKzaa	I don't think that too many of us have given up hope on that small child.

If we change the definition of global warming to "sometimes gets hot, sometimes gets cold, and at other times, is unchanged", we now have a 100% accurate statement.    Do I believe it or not?  I certainly believe there is climate change - throughout history we've had ice ages and periods of hot weather, so why should it stop now?  The dinosaurs are dead, so yes, there are species that became extinct before and there are those that will do so now.  In fact when astronomers were looking at surface temperatures of Mars and Venus, they found a trend of heating, so why should Earth be exempt?    One good sign - those of us who are aware of the environmental challenges during the 70s will remember the cries of "ice age is coming unless we change our ways".  I believe the theory was that carbon dioxide was keeping the sun's heat from coming in.  Wonder what happened to all the Al Gores of yesteryear who were spouting the ice-age mantra?    Just heard that the Chinese are building enough coal fired power plants over the next twenty years than what all of Europe has.  So if you're alarmed by change would you prefer coal plants in the West under our regulations, or shut ours down, pay Mugabe money for carbon credits, and have the same plant open in China with less environmental regulations?    PS - just heard on the radio from someone south of the Outer Banks who experienced snow for the first time in several years.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	You might want to read up a bit on the implications of global warming.It does not specifically mean we get hotter weather.    Increasing global temperature will cause sea levels to rise and will change the amount and pattern of precipitation, likely including an expanse of the subtropical desert regions. Other likely effects include Arctic shrinkage and resulting Arctic methane release, increases in the intensity of extreme weather events, changes in agricultural yields, modifications of trade routes, glacier retreat, species extinctions and changes in the ranges of disease vectors.    The key factor is 'change in the norm'.    astatine:"sometimes gets considerably hotter, sometimes gets considerably colder,sometimes gets considerably windier and at other times, is unchanged"- there,fixed. :)|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	What religion you chose is a matter of belief, global warming is science. And one of the things we will get with global warming is more extreme weather events, both hot and cold. Plus climate and weather are two entirely different things, if you are confused about that you really need to study more.    http://www.skepticalscience.com/global-w...

War in the 13th and 14th century was brutal and savage. Often the order was issued to give "no quarter". Those who survived tended to be the most nasty and vicious. Have you ever seen the casts of the skull of Robert the Bruce? That man survived two massive head injuries, one to the forehead and one to the jaw, and still died in his own bed.

There's only so much we can really know about the character and the motives of a guy who died more than 700 years ago. We don't even know his date of birth, let alone anything about what sort of person he was. He's just a blank historical canvas onto which people can paint their own views and prejudices.    Like many fictional portrayals of Wallace, the film "Braveheart" was based on a poem that was written nearly 200 years after he died, and is not regarded as being in any way historically accurate.|`|iNfkLWkNaa	No, I don't watch this sort of stuff because it's usually so slanted and bears little relation to History. It's in the past and both the Scots and the English should remember this.  William Wallace was not the hero that Hollywood created, we all know that.  What we should remember is our shared history of inventors, scientists, doctors and literary figures who have contributed so much to our present civilisation.  Let the violent, tribal past remain in the past, it's not relevant now.

33ppbrMJaa	It is important because it is the location of the prison where Afghan and Iraqi prisoners have been taken, hooded while traveling, subjected to torture such as waterboarding and other rough treatment, which clearly violated an International Treaty called the Geneva Accords, where the U.S. and other nations vowed to never treat prisoners in this way.    These prisoners were denied attorneys for a long time, then attorneys were finally allowed to see them on a limited basis. They were never charged with any crimes.  Many of them committed suicide while incarcerated. Many were innocent, gathered up in a net by our forces after a $10,000 bounty was offered to anyone turning in a terrorist. Some people turned in acquaintances and neighbors in order to get the money, yet these prisoners were kept for six to eight years without hope of release.    :Pressure from the public caused Bush to finally send some of the prisoners home or to Rehabilitation Camps in places like Saudi Arabia. There is come concern that these men may join Al Queda, and after seven or eight years of waterboarding, extreme temperatures and isolation, perhaps we should expect some animosity among the men released, but a majority of them have resumed normal lives.

Am not going to go OCD because of widespread propanganda lol.........when "holier than thou" politicians will actually come and deliver solutions.....then I will believe them. Otherwise I do not pay attention to "words" which are not backed by actions.    @Oxo : do you know that Ontario came up with the brilliant idea of taxing people if they want to cut off dangerous, dead pine trees ? and make them seek permissions, pay etc ?? I have a pine tree which is getting very old and very sick...branches fall off etc. Why does not the federal government help ? :-)    Why NOT tax people who do not put up trees instead ?? that would make more sense !    edit : love Mrs X 's answer : do NOT have kids..no Pampers, no toys made in China, less plastic (toys, bottles etc), no paper, no crayon, less electricity, less glass , no carpooling, LESS everything !!! ahahahahah :-)|`|AA12015829	I take shorter showers, I don't use many lights and I have replaced 8 of my regular bulbs with florescent bulbs to list the biggest 3.

When they were in opposition, everything from Mrs Smith's dog going missing to the run on the pound was the fault of the government.

AA12349988	I think 'blamed' is the wrong word - everyone was on edge following 7/7<br>  <br>  But he was innocent and unarmed.<br>  <br>  He was also shot 7 times <br>  <br>  I think we can agree regardless of weather he was illegal (which he wasn't) or not mistakes were made, these mistakes should not happen again to someone who is going about their daily business - regardless of weather he is white British (with a tan), legal Spanish immigrant, legal or illegal South American or legal or illegal Asian.<br>  <br>  Lets put this into perspective and remember a man is dead.|`|faddb3c58c57bc112ff5dec44a742ff8aa	No, it was a terrible case of mistaken identity whilst looking for the real terrorists. In this case the outcome was a harrowing and unfortunate death but I believe the police were trying to do their job, believed they were following the right man and believed they had to stop him from committing further atrocities. Unfortunately many people don`t understand the difficulties the police face. My son is a UK copper and it ain`t an easy job. I can`t believe the comment from World War III that `police suck`. So I take it he won`t be calling them  if something awful happens to his wife, daughter, sister or his property? What does this bloke believe in....anarchy?<br>   A mistake like this cannot be corrected by an eraser or tippex but I don`t think you can appoint any blame to anyone and it doesn`t make any difference that he wasn`t British. If the police think someone is the right man for a crime or offence it doesn`t make any difference what nationality or colour he is.|`|Iqco1PcQaa	YES, he was inocent, the officer /s shot him 7 times in the head (how many times do you need to shoot someone to kill them), to kill him was at least manslaughter, working on instructions from superior officer who should be demoted to pc on the beat. they were wrong.<br>  some compensation should be paid x million.|`|3904bf9cec60af77f3ce3e9dfcd8c007aa	No he was an illegal,Instead of running he should have stood still,End of story.|`|UYmRjCY9aa	yes, going on the simple fact that he was followed for so long, why if he was a terror suspect was he actually allowed to get on a train. Where if he had been one, could have blown the whole damn thing to pieces. The police did not behave in a manner that seems to me correct, and no one has really come out and apologised to the family. Ian Blair went to a press conference shortly afterwards and didn't even have the proper facts of the matter. Culpability lies with him and the team who followed and killed this poor guy. |`|GVg6mHI1aa	Yes !<br>  <br>  And a few of them should get done for perverting the course of justice.<br>  Deleting parts of statements  "tut tut"<br>  <br>   When they thought there was no CCTV footage they LIED about him jumping over the barrier and ignoring the police warnings.<br>  <br>  ....oh and not to mention slander, with all that "illegal immigrant" crap. |`|8KdWHcJdaa	Definately. They made a huge c*ck up. Killed an  innocent man, but nothing will happen to them, apart from a bit of suspended duty with pay. How is that justice?<br>  Poor Menezes family they should be compensated, but I guess they would sooner have their son back instead.|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Circumstances led to this poor fellow's death. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time and the police believed he was the terrorist they had to stop, one way or another. The officers involved should never be allowed to carry firearms ever again.|`|UZcUIfwIaa	No.......We should blame the terrorist who made the whole situation possible.......Can you imagine anything like that happening before we had bombs going off all over London?|`|TMBQbi9Oaa	Yes I do and I think it would be an entirely different story if he had been British....there by the grace of god go I, you and everyone else.|`|Gf2tzg5jaa	police suck|`|zZRhoVfAaa	 NO !!|`|Aq7A3EwAaa	Definitely not - he was in this country illegally, which is presumably why he didn't stop when told to. He came out of the block of flats the police were watching, he carried a rucksack and headed for the train station, what were the police supposed to do. wait until he blew people up just to make sure they had the right guy|`|J5EkvOufaa	If they didnt shoot him and he was who they thought he was there would be uproar. <br>  <br>  Everyone's sooo against terrorism, until people actually try to do their jobs, we have islamic hate preachers walking around caliming benefits in case we breach his human rights, people getting very angry because they cant take certain things on planes etc. etc.  <br>  <br>  |`|k4m7PbAnaa	I think it was a mistake and measures should be taken to stop it happening again, but the officers involved are now so shamed I think they don't need huge punishments.|`|PaYA1xUFaa	No, he should have not have been here.|`|AA11366224	OK.  Say they didn't shoot him, and it turned out it was who they thought it was and he did blow up the train and the station leaving dozens dead and hundreds injured.  There'd be an enquiry into why they didn't shoot him.|`|S8RL9lieaa	If he hadn't been here illegally and his true identity known then he'd be alive today. He had the misfortune of looking like one of the terrorists and acted in a manner that gave the police an unenviable choice. Did they shoot or let him detonate a bomb. We all know the outcome but dragging the whole episode through the courts wont bring him back and callous as it may seem a waste of tax payers money.

Y6odIQgJaa	IMHO, they defeated not for that reason, but because the entire world was calling them Nazis for their "approach."|`|i7oHTo9haa	It wasn't Israel's objective to overthrow Hamas.  That would have required a much longer campaign of which Israel doesn't want to control Gaza. Nobody wants Gaza not even Egypt.    The objectives for the war (which were accomplished) were to:    destroy the tunnels that enabled weaponry supplies to be filtered into Gaza    target enemy combatants and cripple Hamas    take other measures to make sure the extremists are not re-armed by smuggling through land and sea    hit them hard so they will realize that Israel will not remain silent while rockets are sent into Israel civilian areas.    It is Egypt's vow to control any further smuggling on the Egyptian-Gaza border and if the weaponry smuggling resumes I expect Israel will re-act with ferocity again. Europeans and Israel are controlling the waters off the sea and already stopped an arms shipment.    Additional gain for Israel is that Hamas is now split between Hamas in Gaza and the Hamas leadership in Damascus. It was Hamas in Gaza when the foreign trained Hamas militants were defeated that begged Meshal for tahdiah (calm) again but Meshal said no. After Meshal said no then the Hamas police took off their uniforms and fired from civilian establishments, even hospitals and UN buildings to take cover from Israel's fire. Israel could have easily defeated them if that were Israel's goal.  But then the West has issues with fainting at the sight of blood and it's interesting that in WW2 nobody fainted where there were literally millions of civilian deaths. There is no law that says there can be no civilian deaths in times of war.  Hamas and Hitler are two of the same, they are bad news and this is an urban war.

IaVDSErJaa	Actually I thought Palin kicked butt.<br>  <br>  I thought that the debate came out even.  I know that both parties were wondering if Palin was going to kick in her game as a business woman and she did.<br>  <br>  Both candidates are tough candidates, however, I think Palin's experience is not as good as Bidens but that is obvious because Biden has the years behind him.  But what really matters is the president candidates and Obama has no experience.  <br>  <br>  I do not support any of the positions that Obama and Biden support.<br>  <br>  I believe the McCain & Palin administration will be a better administration for the future.<br>  <br>  I thought that Palin put Biden and Obama in place concerning the war in Iraq.  If troops come home without winning the war now it will be like another vietnam and the soldiers will be looked down upon and not only that, it will show weakness in our country and this my friends is what Obama wants.<br>  <br>  Obama is a terrorist and only wants america to fall on her face.<br>  <br>  McCain & Palin "08"<br>  True Americans for the American People!|`|4cc767b496173b3227cf5f9f17efd2b5aa	I think the level of discourse between them was honorable. That said, it is clear to me that Palin was coached very successfully and seemed to hold her own to a point. I was not impressed with the attempts at folksy chatter and "dog gone it" stuff, but she was obviously not playing to my demographic. Biden, in my view, was articulate and profound in his responses. When he started speaking about being a single parent and then paused slightly, in that moment of eternity, I could feel his anguish knowing he was seeing he his son off to fight in a war with which he has much criticism. Brought tears to my eyes.<br>  I think Biden nailed it.|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	Yes, I agree - it was a well-fought debate.  Although I am a Democrat, I thought Palin did a good job of presenting herself as a strong leader; however, I do believe that Biden's experience and knowledge on the specifics of all the issues gave him a definite edge to winning the debate.|`|a985f8bafead49ad632401aa87d44b44aa	Biden showed vast knowledge and experience. He maturely stated realistic plans. As for Palin: I just can't embrace a Presidential candidate that refers to the average American as "Joe Sixpack" and winks regularly. Her attempts at humor remind me of when George W. would speak and tried to be charming. I think she gave Tina Fey a lot of new material for the next Saturday Night Live. Stay tuned!|`|zZeXIKmOaa	Palin is a force to be reckoned with!! She clearly stole the lead and continues to amaze me. As she stated herself, it was so nice to get to hear her speak her mind with no mainstream interruptions of people hearing only what they want you to hear (um..like obama fans), she is brilliant. See you at the polls|`|bS4l7GHfaa	BIDEN DUH!! OBAMA BIDEN 08|`|50ec5e8dafe386411d6b620e389824f3aa	They both had strong and weak points.<br>  <br>  Palin did better talking in a way the mid-class might understand but her overall knowledge was shallow and weak.  She may be able to reach out to the public but that reach wasn't very far.  Her lack of experience in high level government was clear to all.<br>  <br>  Biden was vastly more knowledgeable, professional and could sense his many years of experience.  But to his downfall was his  institutionalized persona due to his experience.  But if he can connect to the middle class he would persuade them with facts.<br>  Biden's foreign affairs and relations was so much more superior that you couldn't deny it. It stumped Palin on more than one occasion and she just started limping through it.<br>  <br>  - Who would you want as a leader of a country and attack serious globally threatening situations?   Biden<br>  <br>  - Who would you want for a local leader who connects to the public on a personal basis?  Palin<br>  <br>  Actually, Palin might be a good replacement for Conni Rice because she would do better at one on one conversation and getting to know the diplomats.  She just isn't VP or presidential material.|`|C13Y5s90aa	What a great performance by Palin!<br>  Because that is what is was a performance!!<br>  Someone pull her string and she can go on forever.<br>  Put another nickel in her and she can go on and on but does she know what she's doing. NOT>>>SHE does NOT have a passport!!<br>  But she does have a great view of Russia from her house.<br>  <br>  She was well train last nite....|`|7ULI2TnQaa	I'm not sure how you can say biden hands down. I thought debate wise they were pretty equal.  Im curious what made biden win hands down? they both did good and were respectful.  Mccain/Palin!|`|b1b39b4b70b44020b5007791dfb52e8caa	Polls came in for Biden - she avoided easily 8 or 9 questions and did this Barbie cutsey thing. Palin is an embarrasment.|`|2725f6d8df464c4e78583d9a4a710fb2aa	Biden|`|RrYETSDoaa	Biden<br>  Palin's  one eyed winks are the only thing I found amusing.|`|gTsPpilnaa	I really like Palin. |`|B2BXAgLZaa	Biden...hands down.|`|IcuOh1uVaa	Where do the people who thought Palin "Kicked Butt" live? the fact that she didn't answer any questions, and created her own questions and than answered them, the fact that she lacked any experience there and even said, I will not answer the question.<br>  <br>  Look, McCain and Company has already made sure that there shouldn't be a follow up question to the questions, so even if you didn't answer the question, you couldn't be pressed to answer the question, thats cheating and shows how McCain doesn't trust her at all.<br>  <br>  Grasp of facts and specific solutions, not cute and repetitive rhetoric, is what will put America back as a respected leader in the world. |`|XHqVNUjEaa	I thought they both did a great job.  I thought the moderator gave Biden "the last word" a lot more than she did Palin.  I also thought that Palin did a little more dodging than I liked - and I like her.  And kudos to Biden for being so gentlemenly... Palin gave the wrong name of the general in Afghanistan and he didn't embarress her by correcting her.<br>  <br>  Neither of them were out front so much that they would win people from one side to the other, it seemed to me.  Most people pretty much know how they swing at this point, so nothing they heard would change their mind.  If someone was truly undecided, Biden probably came across as more straightforward and experienced.|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	Palin has an enormous amount of charm and is the quintessential BS artist.  It was rather astounding how she managed to make it through the entire debate without saying one thing of substance and refusing to answer the questions put to her.  She was obviously well coached and expectations were so low that she quite easily surpassed them.  She's a hero for the unwashed masses ... those who want someone in office "just like me" - uneducated and "straight-talkin'" (yet, without knowing what they're talking ABOUT).<br>  <br>  Biden was excellent.  He could have easily been patronizing but he wasn't.  He displayed formidable knowledge of the issues at hand and set point specifics on how to achieve his party's goals.|`|9rCc2YYIaa	It was clearly a very tight debate. Of course no way anyone can say, Palin did not exceed expectations. She did stumble a couple of times though and sometimes beated around the bush instead of answering the question. Biden performed exactly how everyone said he would perform. Though he did seem to focus on mcCain a little bit more. I didn't see any knockouts, of course everyone watches the fight for a big knockout..lol..but as it stands I say it was a draw leaning towards biden.|`|AfA7ZXFhaa	i think that Palin didn't answer any of the question at the beginning and that she was giving more speeches than debates. But I also think that Biden could've been stronger, which he was at time... And Palin with her winks and kinda slang stuff and "maverick" every sentence, I didnt think that was a plus on her side. *im a dem. btw* But I thought the worst part was when Biden choked up, and then Palin kinda chuckled and went on.. I thought that wasnt really respectful from her.|`|f4134fadd61b025c93ff3388611782caaa	I thought Palin was going to choke, but she did ok. She was well coached, that's all, she sounded very rigid and un-natural, seems like she memorized these or was coached for a long period of time. <br>  <br>  Overall, she held on by keeping her cool and surviving.<br>  <br>  As for Biden, he did well. What do you expect? he has a lot of experience.<br>  <br>  I think it is equal.<br>  <br>  <br>  RON PAUL 08!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|pFtHvxlxaa	Basically Palin just winked a lot and acted real cute to cover up her lack of knowledge pertinent to anything relevant to the questions asked of her. I can't wait to hear Tina Fey's inevitable rendition of "Doggone it Joe" and all the other phrases she uses to try to sound so grounded and middle class. If she winks at me one more time I'm going to throw up.|`|AxcA6tDNaa	Biden destroyed her in debating, she did better than expected but the bar was set pretty low.  I really can't stand her and McCain referring to themselves as Mavericks, I hate how she says "Ya betcha," ( we get it your rural, so am I, stop talking dumb) and she says nucular, not nuclear.|`|AA12299544	I am a Liberal.<br>  <br>  Overall it was even.  However, Palin dodged a few questions that she had no clue on how to answer.....<br>  <br>  However, I honestly did not really pay that much attention to the substance of her answers to the fact that she had a pretty face and was pleasing to the eyes.|`|gTnwq11zaa	I am a democrat, however Palin did impress me simply because she did not make any of her usual mistakes.  This is still not justifiable for her to be ready for number 2.  |`|c96f03f00272135ef70c0439fea0e941aa	Biden did better.

oGoWz511aa	She's smiling because she's stupid.  Look at all the things she's done.  First was not being able to handle parenthood, then came her 'technique' to remedy that.  She obviously didn't do too much to hide her tracks.  It probably took them longer to find her because no one thought she'd be dumb enough to keep things so close to home.  Then there's her behavior after the child was missing.  Then how she's been in jail.  I've seen men do it while watching boxing matches.  Getting the crap beat out of them, and smiling right up until they get knocked out.  It's called the "You ain't hurting me" smile.  Like I said, it's what stupid people do, right before they get their clocks handed to them.    She might be thinking of pleading insanity.  Thing of it is, most 'insane' people aren't quite as conniving.|`|x9R9HxFiaa	Because in her sick mind she thinks she will get away with it.|`|W7dO6uoJaa	both a and b|`|N5jBMjrDaa	She is a sociopath.

She'll get what's coming to her. This will be a very very verrrry long trial but she won't be smiling when it's over.

My impression of her is she has never had to take responsibly for anything in life. Her parents handle her with white gloves. Its' almost bizarre. I think she lacks the maturity to understand the situation she is in. She acts like a high school girl with her lawyer. Her lawyer needs a serious reprimand! Even is she did get off by some crazy chance I don't think she even understands her life is over. She is much safer behind bars, forever. Forgotten about and unimportant.|`|OhrysGKIaa	She is obviously not "all there" mentally (delusional?).  She must have a personality disorder like narcissism.  She is not dealing with reality (schizophrenia?).  In a way I suppose this helps her deal with the problems she has.      This does not mean she killed her daughter.  Evidence needs to be presented in court for this.  It is possible she just abandoned her daughter and someone else killed her, but that still makes her guilty of a crime.      But the sad thing is her daughter is dead and that little girl must have suffered a bit to have tape over her mouth.  When I see the videos of that little girl where you see a cute vibrant little girl and then know that she was not cared for and her body was abandoned like trash (bag of bones), it is very disheartening.     Why didn't the grandparents do more to save that little girl?  No wonder the grandfather tried to kill himself.

A workmate of mine left work a few months ago to get a dream job as a hair stylist, so no job hunting struggles there.    Another friend who was a stuck graduate, landed a job for himself in unexpected ways, and now enjoys his working days a lot more.  He is enjoying the feelingof being intellectually stimulated and challenged, and is earning about three times as much as he did.    I also have a third friend who qualified as a sports psychologist last year, and who has now set up his own business which is doing really well.  It is going from strength to strength.    I am also moving on in life, and am starting a new job in a couple of weeks which really does feel like a step up in life, and a major step in the right direction.  It also came to me in very unexpected ways (I didn't even have to try) and when I went for the interview I had nothing but good feelings about the place.

The economy is a lot stronger now than at an downturn before.  The Democrats are again in power in America, so that means that the world's biggest industrialised nation will be socialist once again and the working classes will have more money to spend.  Interest rates are a lot lower now than ever before.  The pound was so low against the euro, so that means that the UK will be a lot more attractive to foreign investment.

It says something like the citizens have the right to raise militias. Those words have been interpreted by gun nuts as the right to bear arms.  The right to raise a militia was included as a measure of protection for the people to defend themselves against and,  if needed, violently overthrow a potential future tyranical central government.     The framers of The Constitution were very leery of an overly strong central government and were in favor of states rights over federal power.   Over time, that original intent of states rights for protection has been eroded. The civil war was probably the start of states rights being diminished.

65dd33172c2e051a332ef7205bf8048aaa	Happy Birthday Girl !   22 ans ?|`|ee60719a87e55211adf51bb2c24d441baa	Ma thorie pour te donner ton age repose sur  l'volution d'une fonction f en fonction d'une variable que l'on peut supposer tre un temps t. L'volution de f peut tre rgie par une quation diffrentielle (auquel cas t prend ses valeurs dans un intervalle), soit par une relation de rcurrence donnant f(t + 1) en fonction de f(t), et dans ce cas t ne prend que des valeurs entires, et on peut considrer f comme une suite dfinie par rcurrence. Ces deux situations sont trs banales en mathmatiques, mais il peut se faire que l'volution du systme soit extrmement complexe. La thorie des systmes dynamiques est ne avec le traitement par Poincar du problme des trois corps, et a t approfondie, en particulier, par Andre? Kolmogorov. Il est possible aussi que la "loi d'volution" de la fonction (quation diffrentielle ou relation de rcurrence) dpende d'un paramtre, auquel cas on s'efforce d'tudier l'influence de la valeur du paramtre sur le comportement asymptotique du systme. (La thorie des catastrophes de Ren Ren Thom part elle aussi de rsultats sur certains systmes dynamiques).     En conclusion et sous rserve de vrifications je te donne un an de plus que l'anne dernire.

aee22a3edd757cb4b63f3d4e5b33de38aa	You don't remember the "Star Wars" plan by Ronald Reagan nearly 30 years ago?    No I don't agree.  I'm still of the unpopular view that until we have housed every person in the US, fed every person in the US, given healthcare (good quality) to every person in the US, we have BETTER things to spend our tax dollars on than creating a "competing with the Joneses" situation!!!!!!!|`|bfd715bd505d45a8f80b5d9c20471882aa	yes, but the chinese just punctured our balloon.|`|AA11957106	Watch the NEWS once in awhile.   CHINA has already blown up, shot down (militarized) 1 of their own satellites in a test of a space missile.|`|66bdc07beca5f9bb77ca5ed12d430279aa	We need to try to stay one step ahead. It's unfortunate but true.|`|AA12178195	In case you missed it:  China made a test recently where they shot a missile at a dead communications satellite.  The test, by the way was successful.  So you tell me.  Who is weaponizing what?  It used to be that space exploration was peaceful.  Well, seems like Reagan's Star Wars project will get revived.|`|16b90b3dfaa701bf0a9de3149874c991aa	I think a situation like this will take patience and self-control to get through without conflict. So they shot down one of their own satalites. OK.  Now we issue a request to the Chinese government asking them not to take such action again out of consideration for the damage the debris can do to our own satalites.   We develop the technology, and pull back our spy satalites for the time being.   After everything cools down, we may even cooperate with China in conducting our own test, this time with OUR technology, to ensure that we too have the capability.  But we DO NOT want to spark off another international crisis that has the potential to quickly turn nuclear.
