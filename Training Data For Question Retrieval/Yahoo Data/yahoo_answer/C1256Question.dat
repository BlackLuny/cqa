20090225024144AASQBYE	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Are we as smart as we think?	I find it amusing that scientists keep saying that we are more intelligent than prehistoric people, but I beg to differ. Here's why-      Einstein's brain was smaller than the average human brain, but he was a genius.      Every time we advance, it's because somebody discovered something then, somebody else found a use for it. Not once has anybody just "magically" invented something. They had the available resources to make their invention. For example, a prehistoric human woke up one day, stepped on a piece of flint, discovered that it cut the bottom of his foot, looked over and saw a long branch, and thought, "Hmmm... If I somehow attach this pointy rock to that stick over there, I might be able to hunt more efficiently.". Nowadays, we have teams of people who think, "Hmmm... If we arrange the Central Processing Unit to be closer to the fan, the thermal efficiency will be  70% higher.".      If you want to argue that the modern humans in the above example were more intelligent becuase they had a larger vocabulary, go ahead. Just remember though that back in prehistoric times, the only need for language was to describe something important, such as a cougar attacking the village. As time went on, we needed more words to describe stuff. Ironically, most of the English language comes from other languages, which comes from older languages, which. well... you get the idea.      So, how intelligent are we?

20090225032632AA0UB45	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Could someone please explain, in basic terminology, what microwave energy is?	how it's made and what happens to it.  For example, the microwave energy in a mobile phone - does it get absorbed by you, the earth, where does it go?     When I say basic terminology, I don't mean talk to me like I'm stupid, I would just like an easy to understand explanation (unlike the internet where you need a degree!)   Thank you very much.

However, I'm not exactly sure if I am solving it correctly. It says:      Triangle ABC has vertices A (0,4), B (1,2) and C (4,6). Determine whether triangle ABC is a right triangle.      Firstly, I found the slope of line AB, which gave me m=-2. I then found the slope of BC, and I got m=4/3. From there, I plotted the two points and found that they intersected/were perpendicular. So, i'd assume that this means they possess a right angle? Thanks.

20090225041641AAgwP40	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	Using hubbles law to determine age of universe - I can't understand the necessary assumption?	Hubbles law says that the further away a galaxy is the faster it is moving away.  As I understand it we can take the distance of a galaxy and divide it by it's velocity to determine the age of the universe.  This requires an assumption that the galaxy has always been moving with the same velocity.      This is where I get lost.  Doesn't this assumption go against Hubble's law itself?  When the galaxy was closer it would have been moving at a slower velocity so this assumption seems very problematic to me.      My question in a nutshell is:  How can we assume that the velocity of receeding galaxies has always been constant?

20090225052446AAmCD6X	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Where might we find structures whose appearance were formed by magnetism instead of gravity?	We see little stuff like this in the charged particles that spiral around the magnetic field lines of planets as they oscillate back and forth between the poles. I say that's little stuff because it only puts on a modest show occasionally with auroras. Could the magnetic field possibly put on a Very Big Show in which its dipole effects dictated the general appearance of a physical system?      What kinds of matter could host such a show? Describe how it would look with all those charged particles doing spectacular things all the way through the magnetic field. Would it be really pretty?      Could this type of physical system occur without a bunch of electrically neutral mass serving as a kind of anchor? That is, could the whole works be made of plasma?

In fact, they say that the snakes do not like the smell of their droppings, and that if the snakes slither over a goose dropping, its skin may become injured by an infection received from the dropping.      However, I have searched online and have found nothing to support such folklore.  Do you have any evidence for this, either pro or con?

I thought I had it, but now I'm getting conflicting answers.  I have a rest energy electron of .511 MeV moving with speed .2c       I need to find total energy, KE, and momentum.      I have questions    KE=E-E0   p=&mu   KE=(&-1)mc^2   E=KE+E0   E=&mc^2   E0=mc^2   so E=&E0 therefore E=&(.511)=.5215MeV   E=KE+E0 therefore KE=E-E0=.0105MeV   Sounds all fine and dandy:E=.5215MeV E=.511MeV KE=.0105MeV      Now for momentum: E^2=(mc^2)^2+p^2c^2   I've converted all MeV into Joules and substituted mc^2=E0   (8.3*10^-14)^2=(6.7*10^-27)^2+p^2c^2   this makes p^2=2.98*10^-45 which seems unlikely.   I have no idea if that equation or p=&mu should be used.       Does this seem right?

Every change in structure, function, and process would have had to develop through random trial-and-error if evolution were true, but no transitional forms have been found.The fossils have not caught any changes in the midst of being created, even though they should have occurred over long periods of time.And the same go's for the human fossil record.

20090203141647AA53jAb	Science & Mathematics;Medicine	HELP ME PLEASE – I have severe OCD – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder – PLEASE HELP ME?	Clicking my ankles is where it all started. I forced them to click constantly for a few years and stopped only last week.  For the last year I’ve been forcing my knees to click also. I could only stop if I was satisfied to end them the way that I wanted where it feels right and evenly clicked. Now I’ve got them all even I’m never comfortable and I think about every move I make. Today I walked on the icy snow and slipped and because I didn’t walk the way I normally would I feel that I have to get all the clicks out of my knees and start over and have a fresh walk otherwise they would constantly feel wrong. I felt a lot more free and able to do things when I was clicking my knees and ankles as I knew that I still had to get them even etc.  I know that this must be hard for anyone to understand but I know what I mean and I can only start living once I’m satisfied. It’s so hard to explain. I don’t think that my OCD is like anyone else’s, only some things are. I feel that I can never be helped. I feel I can only help myself. I can’t explain it at all. I don’t know what to do

THANK YOU!!!      1. Consider the reaction between 50.0mL of liquid methyl alcohol (CH3OH density = .85 g/mol) and 22.8L of O2 at 27 degrees C and a pressure of 2 atm. The products of the reaction are CO2(g) and H2O(g) Calculate the number of moles of H2O formed if the reaction goes to completion.       2. Hydrogen cyanide is prepared commercially by the reaction of methane, ammonia, and oxygen at high temperatures. The other product is gaseous water. What volume of HCN(g) can be obtained from 20L CH4(g), 20L NH3(g), and 20L O2(g). The volumes of all the gases are measured at the same temperature and pressure.      3. A piece of solid carbon dioxide with a mass of 7.8g is placed in a 4L otherwise empty container at 27 degrees C. What is the pressure in the container after all the carbon dioxide vaporizes?    If 7.8g solid carbon dioxide were placed in the same container but is already contained air at 740 torr what would be the partial pressure of CO2 and the total pressure in the container after CO2 vaporizes?      i know the questions are long but if you could do even one i would be so happy! i really did try and finish them so don't tell me to do the homework. Please help and if you do, could you pretty please show your work?!!!

Now at 5:30 I checked it and after putting more peroxide on it I noticed I didn't match the skin up with the cut. I now have a good bit of the "Flap" covering my nail. It already began scabbing. When my skin heals is it going to fix itself or just I open the scab and move the peice covering my nail? Sorry for the nastiness.

20090203144614AA9L2wc	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	Are electrons, etc, a "construct"?	I know that some don't like the word "theory", because in Science a theory doesn't mean a hunch or guess, but rather an explanation for what we can observe (ex. electrons, macro-evolution, earth revolving around the sun).      We've used electron microscopes to look at viruses, etc.  However, we've never been able to observe electrons.  The reason they're considered scientific is because we can falsify them through indirect observation.  I guess saying that something may or may not be true because it's "a theory" makes one sound ignorant, because that's not the definition of "theory" in Science.        What would be a better term to use for theories in Science that we can't observe directly, for things like electrons, etc?  Would "construct" work? Or is there a better term?  I know that "scientific fact" either means observation or law/theory that has been tested so many times that no scientist in their right mind doubts it (and yes, I know that by definition a theory can never become a law).  So, by definition electrons are "scientific fact".  However, until we can observe them directly, we can't know or prove that they're "real", since it's only logical to disprove but not prove in Science.  What would be a proper term for electrons, etc, to convey the message, without sounding ignorant by saying "Oh, electrons are just a 'theory'"?

20090202103559AAwZFE5	Science & Mathematics;Geography	Where did the idea come from that Canada might be the largest country? ?	On more than one occasion (including here on Yahoo Answers) I've heard someone mistakenly claim that Canada is the largest country in the world. The fact that it's actually Russia (and before that the USSR) has never been a matter of controversy among geographers in the way that, say, has been the case for the identity of the longest river. There are no disagreements over the definitions and methods to be used, and (with Russia being almost twice the size of Canada) little scope for any variation in approach to arrive at a different answer. So does anyone know how the idea has arisen that it might be Canada?

20090203141907AAaIkgN	Science & Mathematics;Other - Science	What laws or principles does the living chemical system follow?	Consciousness (biological) is produced by a complex system of chemicals and electricity. Consciousness developed as a biological adaptation in order to sustain the chemical system called life (a chemical system in the state of living). Its basic functions help a living chemical system acquire vital nutrients for energy, repair, and reproduction, keep itself from physical danger, to avoid destruction in general, reproduction (a method of continued system existence if the original individual perishes), keeping other systems from destruction which is insurance of reproductive success, and various other tasks relating to continuing the existence of the living chemical system. The various detailed characteristics of consciousness aside; it is apparent that life is designed to occupy the material world according to particular laws or principles which are what makes the material part of the universe behave as it does. Emotions and Logic are both forms of thought used to be a chemical system to continue its existence. As atoms have no goals nor behave by thinking (an electrochemical process) their behavior is most certainly the result of a natural law or principle.       What laws or principles does the living chemical system follow?       Where or how does such chemical system occur from matter in a non-living or semi-living state in nature?

20090203144723AAIjBK5	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Easy Physics Question?	We did a lab today involving pendulums and their periods (the time it takes them to go back and forth once).  We created a pendulum by attaching string to an apparatus.  At first we kept the string 50 centimeters and after determing the period, each time we added a new weight (washer) to the end of the string.  At first we started of with one, then two, and moved up to five.  Mass is not supposed to effect the period in this lab but we got different periods each time a weight was added on.  This was not supposed to happen so what could be some reasons for this? I'm just curious. Thanks in advance.

20090203144856AAR5aBt	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Math Problem - Probability?	"A box contains three coins, one of which is known to be 'double-headed.' If a coin is selected at random and tossed, find the probability that it falls 'heads.'"      My math homework for tonight (one of the problems). It confused me because at first I thought, "Oh, it's 4/6 because that's how many 'heads' choices there are." But then I thought that maybe the probability of picking a double-headed or normal coin had to be taken into account.   Anyway, tell me what you think the answer is.      My next math class is on Thursday the 5th. Answer before 6 in the morning that day, please! :]

20090203145747AAPO4VC	Science & Mathematics;Chemistry	Difficult Chemistry Question?	At sea level, our atmosphere exerts a pressure of about 14.7 lb/in2, which means that each square inch of your body experiences a force of 14.7 lb from the air that surrounds you. As you descend below the surface of the ocean, the pressure produced by the seawater increases by about 14.7 lb/in2 for every 10 meters of depth.      a) What is the approximate pressure in pounds per square inch exerted by the sea at a depth of 10327 m? (Use 3 significant digits in your answer.)      b) What is the approximate pressure in tons per square inch exerted by the sea at a depth of 10327 m? (Use 3 significant digits in your answer.)
