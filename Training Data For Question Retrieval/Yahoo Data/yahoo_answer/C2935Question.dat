Con il nuovo governo berlusconi ogni giorno sentiamo parlare dell'energia nucleare.Essa fornirebbe molta energia elettrica che verrebbe a costare meno a tutti gli italiani,sarebbe anche un gran risparmio di petrolio e di altri minerali.Ma le scorie dove verrebbero smaltite?chi ci dice che un errore umano non possa provocare la morte di milioni di persone?Alcune fonti dicono che le scorie vengono messe in grandi barili di cemento armato e che essi a loro volta vengano depositati in fondo al mare...un giorno questi barili si eroderanno e le scorie usciranno , le acque diventeranno radiattive e il mondo intero sarebbe dentro una vera e propria catastrofe. Quali sono i vostri pensieri?E' davvero così necessario il nucleare?

20090225020245AAjxmX0	Environment;Conservation	What is semi-reclusive compared to reclusive?	people call me reclusive all the time.   I work from home and take care of my mom's affairs, she lives near me but not with me, she had a stroke and can't speak, but lives alone.   so I go to the dr's with her and pay her bills.   all I do is go to the grocery store every 2 weeks and other errands   .I never go to parties or friends houses or to lunches, dinners or parties, I have friends, that I see rarely, mostly speak on the phone (I prefer) I almost always turn down invitations to go out   and no im not over weight and ugly haha, ive travelled lots of places   but mostly I like being alone, the way most people are makes me uncomfortable, the rudeness and self obbsessed, rude people along with my nautural loner nature makes me wanna stay to myself.   always has. I read, watch old movies and go for walks.I am friendly to people and neighbors when I see them. but am really a loner.   so does that make me reclusive or semi-reclusive?   since I do have to go out now and then.   I know im not social!   by the way I am in my early 40's..once in a great while I will go to a movie, maybe once a year.   I tried to be social a few years back, but it left me drained.
