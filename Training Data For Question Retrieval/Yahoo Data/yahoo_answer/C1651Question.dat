20090225093401AA8aDze	Travel;United States;Sacramento	Can a resident or former resident of Sacramento answer some questions?	I have a pretty good opportunity for a job in in Sacramento and I'm looking for some information about the area before I make my final decision. My wife lived up there in 01-02, but things change especially in this economy, so I'm hoping that residents or recent former residents of Sacramento will be able to give me some info.       Housing and rental market information is easy to find - the internet is lousy with articles about every conceivable housing market. Everything indicates that the housing market, while not stable, is at least considerably cheaper than LA where I live now.       I'm obviously not worried about the job market if I'm thinking of moving up there for a job - I don't plan to take the job unless it's everything I'm hoping it will be, and more.       What I can't seem to find is information about the neighborhoods surrounding Sac (like Somerset, Citrus Heights, Elk Grove, Rancho Cordova, etc). Like, where are the good/bad neighborhoods?       Also, taking those neighborhoods into consideration, how is the traffic from those areas into Sac? Granted, I don't know exactly where I'll be working, but for the purpsoes of this question, I'm going to figure that I'll be living somehwere in the outskirts and working in the thick of it.       Also, is there any other information that will be helpful in my decision? How's the social scene? Is there a theatre/arts district? How's the crime? Is there a zombie holocaust happening now, or looming in the near future? Can you go out without having your leg humped by roving bands of horny stray pot-bellied pigs?       I appreciate your help!

Question # 14 (brought to you by Zelda Hunter)      "Does it bounce, flatten or shatter if you drop it?"            Now remember....   1. it's a mineral   2. it's smaller than a breadbox   3. it's a fairly common item   4. it's hard   5. we could make jewelry out of it, but not in this case.   6. Fireball would not ( I think, lol ) consider it sinful   7. Jack B. would not use it for evil.   8. If a person tried to eat it, they would have extremely serious physical problems, probably death   9. It won't be found in the vitamin aisle at the Drug Store   10. yes, it could be used as a tool   11. no, it is not an icepick in the forehead (like marriage, lol)   12. It won't stain your fingers or make your breath stink.   13. This item would send MacGyver into sensory overload.      answer the question and come up with next week's question, and remember, smile and enjoy life

And all cars will be required to use bio-disesel fuel which will be provided at the gas pumps.       And there will be skyscrapers that go up to space and the Bryan Adams Hotel with oxygen masks so you can breathe in the stratosphere on the 505,000th floor, with a Canadian 24/7 buffet all you can eat on the 354,294th floor.

My hubby and I are booked to go to Orlando from the 21st - 27th Dec this year where we'll be visiting Universal Studio's (2 days), Seaworld (1 day), Aquatica (1 day) Wonderworks and Ripley's (1 day), and Kennedy Space Center (1 day). Thereafter we're off to Disney world from the 27th Dec - 2 Jan where we'll be staying at the Caribbean Resort.  But we're starting to think that maybe a week just in Disney world is too long. Should we reduce our stay at Disney world with a day or two and rather spend it perhaps visiting Miami for a day or one of the other beaches close by?

20081106171053AAOwYXE	Travel;Latin America;Other - Latin America	Lima, Santiago or Buenos Aires for study abroad?	Ahh. Help me! I want to spend a year studying at a university in South America. At first, I was convinced I wanted to go to Lima, but apparently,or so I have heard, it is ugly, dirty, and full of poverty. Then again, it seems it would be friendlier than BA and cheaper. I don't know much about Santiago; other South Americans I have talked to don't seem to know much about it.      Is there enough to do in Lima for a year? Will I totally regret not going to seemingly fun/vibrant Argentina? Everyone says it is amazing, but I feel like Lima would be more unique...

I'm going to Germany in the spring (that is if I get my passport set up).  I know it is a big pain in the butt to get a passport, but I hear that if you are just renewing it...it's much easier.        I was adopted by my dad when I was like 6....my name was changed.  Can I just get an updated passport even if I have a different name?

20090225093229AAeqIle	Travel;Europe (Continental);Greece	Why muslim albanians have to change their names  in today's EU state of Greece, to be able to find a job?	Greece is the only country in the world which uses such a method against emigrants of different religion, who are desperate to work in greece, changing their names  to greek orthodox to employ them.   There are albanians in Italy , Germany , France , UK, etc but only in Greece you have to change the name to get a job.   And after they are called as vorioepirots.    This country has some real issues about human rights.
