IWyrJ7o3aa	No way lived in the country, the only charm we learned is what our mother tried to teach us.|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	I did not go to charm school, but after I graduated from high school I went to live with my grandmother's cousin and she was a very classy lady that taught me everything I know about charm.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Lol!  My mom didn't send me.  I wanted to go.  It was called Cinderella Charm School where they teach you to walk and put on make-up. I loved it and had my own carrying case.  I was going to be a model in New York like That Girl on my own at 16.  Purchased my own suitcase and everything.  My mom quickly discouraged that plan. Thanks for the memories.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	No, they knew it would be hopeless, my sister who is younger was born with charms, she could charm anyone except me. I knew her little games. I was such a tomboy, I loved climbing trees and playing baseball. She would sit on the sidelines and watch. She liked wearing dresses, I like wearing jeans.  Poppy|`|Dm9L3EdAaa	Nope. We are a very informal, laid back bunch in this household.  I'm sure it's quite obvious that I never went to charm school.|`|EzrdyxAiaa	yes it was right between the cow barn and the hog house!!!|`|XEbrGfZuaa	In the years I went to HS, there wasn't such a thing in our city. The<br>  only extra curricular school I went to, was a dancing school. And any-<br>  one, who wanted to be popular went to the one near where I lived.<br>  By the time those weeks were over, we all knew how to fox trot, and<br>  do the Swing, the Tango,and the Cha Cha, My girlfriend and I learned<br>  things about teenage girl behavior from books and we also belonged<br>  to a citywide club that was in a department store. And we met on <br>  Saturday mornings. The moderators would show slides and have other<br>  visual aids on fashions, and hair styles and proper date manners, and<br>  just about anything a teenager would want to know about. We all had<br>  to show a pin we were given, that had the initials for the club, to get<br>  into the auditorium in the basement of the store. It was fun and we<br>  looked forward to going once a month. Girls from all over the city came. And naturally, we'd check each other out silently, but not too<br>  obviously, as to what they were wearing at their school. So basically,<br>  we had to learn how to behave and walk, and talk from several sources. And many of us learned things from teen movies of that day<br>  as well. How many of us, learned what it might be like, after watching Elvis kissing a girl, to think we wanted to be on the receiving end someday? And we studied the process, and took mental notes. Oh<br>  those days of inocence, proper etiquette and all the other things that<br>  kept us apart from generations before or since.|`|acaJSqW6aa	While fairly young my mother had me walking about with a book on my head, shoulders back and toes pointing forward. <br>  Then there was how to set a table and arrange flowers and on and on.. I also had to sit at the table doing my penmanship. (It is the first impression a person has of you) all those up and down marks and continuing circles and don't forget to stay within the lines!  My mother had beautiful penmanship and so did her mother who did handwritten invitations for money.|`|aced1634cc8beb7af40e221d3df797a2aa	Musica - No, but manners and etiquette was stressed all through school and at home.<br>  <br>  We had to walk around with a book on our head - placing one foot in front of the other.<br>  <br>  We also had to to learn to embroider hankies and never go to church without one.<br>  <br>  We learned proper table setting and how not to put our arms and elbows on the table.<br>  <br>  My Granny told us we need to learn our manners.  She said, " How do you know - maybe someday you will sit at the President's table and how will you know what fork to use?"<br>  <br>  So guess what - I taught my kid's just in case and they have taught their kid's too.  No - none of us have sat at the President's table. lol.<br>  <br>  You are very fortunate to have gone to charm school, even though you didn't like it at the time.<br>  <br>  Very good question.<br>  DeeJay.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Nope. My dad was Air Force and never clocked out when he came home."Sit up straight! Comb your hair. Quit biting your fingernails or you'll wear a sign around your neck saying I Bite My Nails!!. You eat like a damn pig. Need a shovel?" I said yes to that last one and got my head thumped. .......40 years later, I still bite a nails a tad! ha.|`|XzLUA7ataa	My aunt raised me, and I remember her talking about charm school.  She probably thought I needed it, but never sent me.  But I remember she had me practice walking upright balancing a book on my head so that I'd learn to be graceful.  I'm still a klutz.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	No, didn't go to any formal charm school. My Mother did tell me to walk with a book on my head for posture and to sit with my knees together at all times. To cover my nose and mouth when I cough or sneeze. That's it as far as I can remember back to those days.|`|207dFmdHaa	I was from the south, so from the age of 3 I went to classes once a week, till the age of 7....then again from age 9-12 I hated it.I complained so much and caused so much trouble that my mom let me quit|`|qxteTM9Kaa	No,I was a total tomboy|`|AxtRjMlGaa	Yes. I went to Eve Brown's School of Modeling in 1967, I believe,the year that is. Lol;<br>  I'm a real "prissy" girl so I loved it. I sent my daughter to Sears Modeling school in 1994.  She unfortunately is not a real prissy girl, but it definitely helped to round her out to be a nice young lady.<br>  I recommend charm school and modeling school for all young girls between 12-16. Some school I read about in  the south, like Virginia, have schools to teach not only charm but etiquette in setting a table, seating, dancing and formal attire to boot.<br>  <br>  I would always tell the children in the family, you can wear Tommy Hilfiger, but would he invite you to tea with such manners not fit to eat with the Queen. They keep teasing about where is that dinner invitation.|`|ur3vgbXoaa	Not an actual school, but it was <br>  crammed down my throat all my <br>  younger life, so I would have <br>  manners, etc.  <br>  <br>  After I was grown and looked around, <br>  I was glad that I had learned all this stuff.<br>  <br>  However the thing that I did NOT learn<br>  was to stand up for myself or to argue<br>  or disagree with anyone.  <br>  (It wasn't ladylike)<br>  <br>  Therefore<br>  I have been a 'well-mannered' <br>  doormat more than once!!|`|VpOGcG4maa	Was it Montgomery Wards ? That is where I went !<br>  ...

Left never to go back...|`|0ede6ed5af86402f961daba9a691dc95aa	I was not sent to charm school and not even sure if there were any in my area to be sent to, but I was taught good manners and had plenty of books about manners.  I remember a book I received for my birthday one year ... White Gloves and Party Manners.  Thanks mom!|`|ac825b3aff0d9322a9befa72bcf651f6aa	Well I was never a young girl,but I can swear on everything I hold dear,they definitely never sent my sister..<br>  A was adept at dodging various missiles she lobbed at me if I upset her|`|AAgX0SDcaa	No but threatened to if I didn't stop flopping down on the sofa.

In every other religion, Humankind is responsible to achieve "higher consciousness," make sacrifices, do good deeds, or whatever else is necessary to restore this broken relationship. Christianity is the only belief system in the world that teaches that God is the one who bridged the gap. God is perfect and we are not so we are separated from our creator. Christ, the perfect man because he was in very nature God, took our punishment so that we could be reunited with God if we trust Him alone for our salvation. There is nothing we could ever do to earn God's favor.

It is the oversimplification of a group to distort it image and incorrectly categorize them based on bias appeals. There are facts such as there are black  people and white people (those are not stereotypes, they're facts). Then there are stereotypes such as all gay men are flamboyant.

Neither side is really "wrong" and each is given from a particular point of view.<br>  <br>  However, as we try to take an objective view of history and the predictions that various gods have made about it, yes, it does show that that gods are not supported.  This is especially true when world history is taken into account rather than focusing on a particular area where a religion is prevalent.|`|70OClBEQaa	like wise i have always said that religion was created in order to answer peoples questions. people didnt have the technology we have today to say the world is round or whatever people had questions and someone needed to answer those questions so HUMANITY invented the idead of GOD they said well there was this one guy who created the world and people would ask why? how? when? so the bible was created The End|`|dFrMhJxUaa	I agree, human history is more important then any religion.|`|AA12360579	I'm not a very scientific person.

Personally i get a better feeling from time spent creating (drawing, writing, cooking, constructive hobbies, ect...) then i do from time consuming (watching movies, listening to music, playing video games).  though i stay focused on what i'm doing i find myself thinking about a broader range of topics, and more in-depthly to boot.  periods where i'm active like that tend to be the ones that don't feel like they moved quicker then i did.<br>  good luck|`|jOPUBmlJaa	Why do the seasons change, why does the grass grow, why are babies born, why do old men/women die, we all do.

I think we often think of life as passing by fast because when we look back, the only things we remember are the good times. But the days that were just "routine" which are most of the days in our life, they don't stand out. They are all the same because you have to do pretty much the same thing, get up, eat, go to work, work, come home, chores, sleep, and so forth. But when you do something memorable, your you will actually look back and say, "wow, i did a lot so far in my life!" also, it feels really good doing something good for people, people who really need it. It also gives you a joy like nothing else I ever experienced in this world. Because there is something to living other than just for yourself, it gives you a certain fulfillment. And the great thing is, even though we all have to die, at least after you'll be gone your deeds will go after you. At least you will  leave a trail of kindness in someone's life, and that is worth living for. That's what I think anyway.<br>  Good luck :)|`|WfVWE5U6aa	It does...doesn't it?....Are you taking some time out for yourself?....Time for reflection?....If you have a family...I find time goes all the faster !!!....It's good you're realizing it sooner than later....that's a big step !....Carpe Diem...Seize the moment !!!....|`|UO3i8BqVaa	Two things happen as you get older; time seems to pick up speed and the floor get further away when you need to pick up something.<br>  ~|`|Z29oDYdWaa	believe in god

Caribbean-American, to be precise. I'm a girl, and I attended an all-girl high school that was filled mostly with white girls. They used to tease me at times and comment on my skin color, teasing me for being dark-skinned. They'd say things like, "You're so black that when the lights go out you only see your teeth." I used to let their negativity affect me greatly, but now I'm a Freshman in college and, it's a different ball game. I still encounter ignorant people but it's nowhere near as bad as it was in high school.<br>  <br>  If I could go back in time with my new way of thinking, I'd give those dumb girls a piece of my mind.<br>  <br>  All in all, they're ignorant and they sound uneducated and racist.

For Satan is the rule of this world, not God.  Satan's time is almost up from ruling this world.  At Armageddon, that is when Satan's ruler ship come to expire.  Then Jesus will take full control for the thousand years reign.  After the 1000 year of Jesus' rule, then he turn over the Kingdom to his Father, Jehovah God to rule to time indefinite.  Until Armageddon, Satan needs to step up to his position as the world ruler.<br>  <br>  Luke 4:5-8: So he brought him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the inhabited earth in an instant of time; ?and the Devil said to him: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it. ?You, therefore, if you do an act of worship before me, it will all be yours.” ?In reply Jesus said to him: “It is written, ‘It is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.’”<br>  <br>  John 14:30-31 Jesus said to his disciples: "I shall not speak much with YOU anymore, for the ruler of the world is coming. And he has no hold on me, ?but, in order for the world to know that I love the Father, even as the Father has given me commandment [to do], so I am doing. Get up, let us go from here."<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:1-3: "Furthermore, [it is] YOU [God made alive] though YOU were dead in YOUR trespasses and sins, ?in which YOU at one time walked according to the system of things of this world, according to the ruler of the authority of the air, the spirit that now operates in the sons of disobedience. ?Yes, among them we all at one time conducted ourselves in harmony with the desires of our flesh, doing the things willed by the flesh and the thoughts, and we were naturally children of wrath even as the rest."|`|bOaqWNxRaa	Life isn't all bad- there's good and bad in everything.<br>  <br>  God does allow it, because we all sin.

I'll give you a hint, it's A.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	The ultimate answer to this difficult question is that when Adam and Eve sinned (Genesis chapter 3), they brought evil, sickness, disease, and death into the world. Sin has been wreaking havoc on the human race ever since. Birth defects occur because of sin...not because of sins the parents or the baby have committed, but because of sin itself. The hard part of the question is why God allows people to be born with terrible birth defects and/or deformities. Why doesn't God prevent birth defects from occurring?<br>  <br>  The book of Job deals with the issue of not understanding why God allows certain things to occur. God had allowed Satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him. What was Job’s reaction? “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15). “The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21). Job didn’t understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew that God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him. Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well. God is good, just, loving, and merciful. Often things happen to us that we simply cannot understand. However, instead of doubting God's goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the answer to this question has to be “I don’t know.” We will never be able to fully understand God and His ways. It is wrong for us to question why God allows something to occur. We simply have to trust that He is loving, good, and merciful – just like Job did – even when the evidence seems to indicate the opposite. Sickness and disease are the result of sin. God provided the “cure” for sin in sending Jesus Christ to die for us (Romans 5:8). Once we are in heaven, we will be free from sickness, disease, and death. Until that day, we will have to deal with sin, its effects, and its consequences. We can praise God, though, that He can and w|`|f1ycXGuHaa	No.  God gives us challenges to give us opportunities to prove ourselves, generally NOT to punish us.

GqfiRXu3aa	You should have told your other friends, "She's just shy around people she doesn't know.  She's a good friend."  That would have reiterated the fact that she's your friend and they don't know her the way you do.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	and these people are your friends??<br>  in order to have friends, you must be a friend.<br>  as a "host" , it is your job to make sure that your quiet friend<br>   feels comfortable.  you're not doing anyone a favor by allowing<br>  your "friends" be rude to your "friend" .|`|AA11656721	My children are fun, and they have a lot of good things to talk about.  But when they don't know a person really well, it's like they freeze up and can't speak unless I tell them to say something.  Some have found that to be a bit rude.  I just think it has to with lack of self esteem, and nervousness.  They are smart kids but they feel like they might embarrass them selves in front of others if they say the wrong things.<br>  There is nothing wrong with being shy, it's a very common thing with youths today.  Just tell your so-called friends to be kind and forgiving, then patiently wait until your new friend is comfortable enough to open up.  Perhaps she can sense the hostility and this is one reason why she can't open up to them.  Don't give up on your new friend.|`|wsQwfKn4aa	Well, being quiet can be interpreted as being rude for a lot of reasons. If someone said something that really requires a response (like saying to a group of people that they had a terrible day) and this person did not respond, she might seem uncaring.<br>  Maybe your friends thought that she was not communicating because she thought she was too good for them. Is she pretty? Does she have nice style? Either of these make this one more likely.<br>  Here's the thing - silence is blank, and people tend to write their own fears and ideas on something that is blank, so they probably interpret her as being rude because that's what they are afraid of or because that's the reason THEY would be quiet in that situation.|`|T9GHYvGGaa	I'm a quiet person and have dealt with this problem all my life.  It's hard to immediately jump into conversation with people you don't know, especially if they're talking about things they all share that the other person has no clue about.  And it's often hard to get a word in edgewise if not directly spoken to.|`|AmfIeV5Zaa	i think its bcuz when people try to make a conversation with u and u just nod ur head instead of trying back then its kinda rude|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Dump your friends, they failed the basic common courtesy test and stick with your quiet friend, she is worth more than a dozen of those witches.

1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	If you're into asian languages and you want a useful language, try Japanese (Though trust me it's nothing like Chinese. Language isolate). Depending on where you live there could be large pockets of Japanese people, there are many important Japanese companies, and the language is just plain awesome. It has much more complicated grammar though than Chinese. <br>  <br>  In terms of usefulness, try Spanish. Very important nowadays and it's related to French (In fact I can't understand spoken spanish very much but I can understand written spanish no problem)<br>  <br>  However, I love Japanese and I think you should try it. There aren't really tones except for a few stress syllables (as in "Hashi" can mean either Chopsticks or Bridge depending on which syllable you emphasize but that's it)<br>  <br>  German is cool too, and Germany is a great country and I know a few German people. It is related to English and has similar grammar.<br>  <br>  But, try Japanse ^^ It's very melodic too. Shares a writing system with Chinese (but reads it differently), but they only use 2000 characters and Chinese uses less. It also has it's own two writing systems but you can learn those rather quickly.|`|mR50HEWDaa	What about Russian?<br>  Obviously it's not as useful as Chinese but it still has many speakers. It is the most wiudely spoken Slavic language and is one of the UN's official languages. It's the 4th-7th  most spoken language in the world, depending on who you ask. Look into it. <br>  <br>  Personally I would want to learn Hindi. It's the 2nd most spoken language and is spoken by a cuntry that is quickly on the rise. Seeing that you already know English, Spanish, and French I believe Hindi is that way to go. <br>  <br>  Some others that are interesting: Japanese, Portugese, Swahili and Italian.
uxvskU7Xaa	i think we should|`|F0UF9DDeaa	Well it is a very nice gesture, me being 3/4 Cherokee and 1/4 Creek Indian and all, but the purpose of us fighting so much to wasn't to keep the land . It was more to keep our heritage which was taken away when we were placed on reservations. No longer to hunt and survive in the was of our ancestors. Any way. We are few and far between now and it is too late. My family and I still hunt and fish, but we have to do it according to the governments standards now. I am not saying that sportsmen should be alowed to hunt and kill everything, but when it comes to eating what you want to eat and fresh meat with out all of the steroids and harmones<br>  it would be just better to to kill your own food. I know that many of you will not understand this, but in order for you to go to McDaonalds, Burger King etc Some thing had to die or you would not have been eating. At any rate.... It takes a village to raise a child. The meaning of that metaphor is "If you want your values bestowed in your child then you need everyone around you to believe as you do and have the same values as you" With everyone trying to take the so called salvage out of Indians, the lost most of their values for their children. <br>  At any rate... It will never happen and the Reservations will soon get smaller. <br>  The ironic thing in all of it is. The government sent the Indians on the trail of tears to no mans land where a coyote could barely survive and   landed them there. Many years later Indians struck oil and are now wealthy.... Some pissed off government would you think!! lol|`|LCdOocBAaa	Because it was never theirs.<br>  If Native Americans were strong enough to fight people off, it would of been theirs, but they weren't and still aren't.<br>  <br>  If it weren't for Europeans they would be living like cavemen.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	greed.  they stole it.  remember the trail of tears.  forced the indians off the land because the govt wanted that particular land.<br>  sad and embarressing that american govt did that.<br>  i think the native americans are getting the last laugh with their casinos !!|`|3nx4rLNgaa	Because it's everyones land, not just non-native american people.

This was the Native Americans land first anyway|`|2ydF6OTAaa	it's kind of late to leave right? Why not share it? Like we should have done then.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	We can't. People own and buy land and it's not the government's to take. Besides, there's no way to determine who's "Native American" enough to obtain benefits. It could be ethically unfair to include or outcast someone of mixed Native American heritage. There's no clear cut way to decide who gets what and how much. But I do think Native Americans need more benefits on the reservations. They've been living poverty for over a hundred years on those things when America was originally their land in the first place.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	That idea sounds very noble, but at this point, it may actually be impossible.  Many of the tribes on the East Coast were killed off, or "assimilated" into the white and black populations.  The other larger tribes were sent to reservations in the West, so many generations have become accustomed to a certain way of life.  <br>  <br>  The sad part is that greed is behind the horrible treatment that many native Americans suffered.  I read an article about how someone of the Blackfoot tribe, lead a suit against the US government for billions in profit that would be owed to them from land held in trust.  <br>  <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=080626020739.xeie0517&show_article=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=...</a>|`|ncdTxID9aa	Then where will everyone else go?  How do you give land back to people today that weren't around centuries ago?  I think Native Americans here as well as other minorities who choose to move up in this country are doing just that.  You can't deny this land to born Americans whatever race they are.  Anti Americans can leave if they want to.|`|AA10232076	I'd be all for it, if it weren't for the fact that Native Americans are mostly displaced at this point, and since Europeans killed 90% of the Native American population when they arrived here, they really couldn't use the land (I hate to so that). Plus, where would I go as an American?

85a4c9cde9714c89ebb089295f22fa0daa	That means if you have unprotected intercourse between Nov 10th and Nov. 18th, you can get pregnant. The ovulation date is a probable, so you could ovulate earlier, and sperm is viable up to 3 days inside your body, so if you have sex before you ovulate, the sperm from 3 days ago could fertilize that egg. Hope that makes sense|`|noL54L5Eaa	Ovulation is the time you are most fertile.

sKwQiAK6aa	Vampires are real, but nothing like Twilight, Buffy, Blade, etc.  I am a real vampire and you can ask me anything you want to know about them, as for telling about myself you can check my profile.|`|eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. <br>  1. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|KxBExkiYaa	Yes.<br>  Vampires have always been, are now, and I pray they will always be real.<br>  Just not the way the movies and books make them look like.

So far, I only have knowledge of the Psychic vampires, and I doubt the media ones. This type of Vampirism is something you are born with. Genetic, I believe. However, one is not aware of it until they reach an Awakening, which normally occurs around 15-16. No superpowers or anything. They are technically human, yes humans, that have an energy deficiency and have to get 'extra' energy from someone else. There's the psychic kind, which feed on a person's energy. There's also the actually blood drinkers that get the it from donors. They can be beautiful, but it depends on genetics, just like any other human. They can be strong, but they have to work at it, like any other human. They don't have a phobia of garlic or anything. Get the point?|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	(sigh).... no... please, think about it.

All you have to do is sit in a quite room and close your eyes. After that relax until you are extremely comfortable with your surroundings. Take deep slow breaths and imagine, not think, you are standing over a pond or lake on a bridge. Now imagine the sun envelops you in a white light. Then drop all of your worries into the pond or lake, don't concentrate that allows your conscious mind to take over. Now walk over the bridge to a meadow with a little stream running through it. Trees surround the streams. You may see people, these are spirits and nature spirits, talk to them if you like. You can ask them any question and they will answer, don't strain to here what you want and you will get an accurate answer.<br>  P.S. I am 13 and I may be an awakening vampire!!

I3rjYVUFaa	It's really very easy, brother...You get out your Bible, and open it to where the preacher directs and follow along.<br>  <br>  One of two things will happen VERY quickly:<br>  <br>  1) The preacher will start to build a sermon WITHOUT scripture references simply speaking as if he knows the Bible...If this happens, you need to GET OUT FAST. No true man of God will EVER say something that is NOT found in scripture:<br>  <br>  Rev 22:17  And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely. <br>  Rev 22:18  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book: <br>  Rev 22:19  And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book. <br>  <br>  I would ADD here that there are over 800 promises God has made to us believers, but we WILL NOT necessarily see them in THIS life. Please read Hebrews 11, the whole chapter. NOTICE that Hebrews 11 does NOT say that these WERE NOT worthy of wealth, to the contrary, it says that THE WORLD was not WORTHY of THEM!!!<br>  <br>  The health & wealth "gospel" is NOT SCRIPTURAL!!!<br>  <br>  2) IF the preacher can base ALL of his teachings on scripture, line upon line, precept upon precept, it MAY be that God is leading you to become involved in THAT local body of believers. <br>  <br>  You may have noticed that I have NOT EVEN MENTIONED televangelists. Why? Because of how the New Testament defines a local body of believers:<br>  <br>  Heb 10:25  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. <br>  <br>  Can ANYONE tell me how it is POSSIBLE to "assemble ourselves" on TV? A local body of believers is hardly a Super Bowl. We are to share one another's burdens and care for one another, this is NOT possible using TV.<br>  <br>  Suzanne army of one has also spoken very well. If you are concerned of your own judgment, please allow me to lovingly point out scripture to you:<br>  <br>  2Co 13:5  Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates? <br>  <br>  I examine myself also brother. If you were to come forward at our local church to receive Christ, they would pray with you and GIVE YOU a gospel of John.<br>  <br>  That's why my avatar is John the Baptist...I know the disciple John is a different man, but the GOSPEL OF JOHN is regarded by scholars as the SIMPLEST of the gospels. I like John because John is simple, straightforward and can be understood by simpletons like me. John is also reassuring elsewhere in scripture:<br>  <br>  1Jn 5:13  These things have I written unto you that believe on the name of the Son of God; that ye may KNOW that ye have eternal life, and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Scripture says that we know all men by their fruits.<br>  <br>  Sharing a hard-learned lesson:<br>  <br>  Stay away from the televangelists.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Are you a born again believer in Christ?  If you are, you have the spirit of God within you.  I find it very, very easy to tell if someone is preaching the true gospel or not.  I just listen to them for a few moments.  If they have the spirit of God, it connects to the spirit of God in me.  If they make me squeamish, which so many of these people do, I know they do not have God's spirit.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Televangelists do have a place at this time on earth, and many have been called for this ministry.<br>   <br>  First, you will know them by their fruit and it's important to read the bible for yourself, to know what God is saying for yourself.|`|uxfacsgmaa	The lesson here might be that there is no such thing as a 'true' man/woman of God.

You could check out the preacher's financials to see where all the money goes. This doesnt mean that every single dime has to go to the ministry...but if the majority of it is used to do good things in the world, you can have a reasonable amount of confidence in him.<br>  <br>  For myself, I prefer to donate money to local assistance organizations...like the food shelf...or the big brothers or sisters...or my local churches that I see doing a lot of good things. And I am just about ready to embark on a new venture where some of my money is going to produce container vegetable and herb crop gardens for the elderly in my community. This is a project that will allow me to see the good that is done as I will make and deliver them myself.|`|1WisnX8naa	I'd dare anyone to meet me on the street and determine that I am an atheist by looking at me or after meeting with me without asking me if I'm religious or any similar questions, as I won't lie.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	You can see Jesus and His righteousness in a person just as you can see the absence of Jesus in a person.

Wolves in sheep's clothing are those who preach a gospel requiring a belief in certain dogma.  Sheep preach a gospel of spirit and truth.  Wolves require your obedience to their doctrines.  And sheep require you to be obedient to the spirit born in your own heart.  And lastly and most importantly wolves don't believe in suffering for anything, selling you on a gospel of prosperity while there are so many who suffer in poverty.  Sheep like the old woman on the steps of the temple are giving there last pennies to Gods work on the earth.  And they obey the call to pick up their cross and follow.<br>  <br>  The tree and its fruit they will tell you is about sin fullness, but in Luke's gospel he follows it with the testimony of a man's lips being what comes from his heart.  If a man walks in the light, confessing and renouncing sin as first John describes, he is freed from his sin.  This testimony is from his heart as it crosses his lips.  Not a perfect adherence to pious doctrine, but a testimony in the spirit of the truth of your condition.  This is how we are called to worship, in spirit and truth.  They would have you believe Jesus is God and all we need to do is believe and that those who sin are in danger of hell.  We all sin daily.  No the ones in danger of hell, but those who fail to come into the light to confess their inner condition.  This is the fruit, what they choose to do and say about their own sins and other peoples sins.  The parable of the unmerciful servant was given as an example of improper conduct of those living in the spirit.  The wolves want you to believe you will end up in hell as a result of not accepting their dogma about our master, in order to win you over.  And the truth is as Jesus said in the parable of the wise and foolish builders, obedience to his word which he states in John is to love one another as I have loved you.  What will actually end you up in hell is not having his heart when he returns, consider the end result of the unmerciful servant and I am sure you can come to no other conclusion than what I am sharing.  What I believe about Jesus is not as important as whether I believe in him.  This is the point I'm trying to get you to see.  Selling you on Jesus being God is not a necessity to your salvation.  Believing on him as God's only begotten and his shed blood for you is all that is required.  This is an example of the dogma that has been responsible for more wars throughout history than anything else, and yet he told peter to put away his sword.  Do you know how many people have been killed over whether they believed Jesus was God or not?  It's sickening!  So give up on the dogma cry out with all your heart, ask seek knock, and he will reveal the wolves to you personally in your own heart.<br>     sincerely yours in his love Christian...|`|QqxZzvbAaa	the way to know is to compare what they say to the word of God,if it doesn't match up then they are wolves.<br>  <br>  I knew from the moment I first heard Robert Tilton that He was way off<br>  because He didn't hide it very well,but a lot of them do.<br>  pray and ask God for discernment to be able to tell who is on the right path.<br>  and beware of anyone who preaches the "prosperity gospel"<br>  Joyce Meyer,Benny Hinn,Kenneth Copeland,T.D Jakes,Creflo Dollor,Joel Osteen.<br>  these are people who preach a different gospel than the one preached in the bible.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Suzanne: very good answer.<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|VRl1jENHaa	Yeshua said that we must look at the person's "fruit" in order to ascertain whether they are a wolf or a true believer.  Robert Tilton's "fruit" (i.e. his works and his teachings) was bad.  Therefore, the man was a false teacher and a wolf.<br>  <br>  John Hagee's "fruit" LOOKS good on the surface, but he has repeatedly lied about his belief in "Dual Covenant Theology" (the belief that Jews don't need Yeshua to be saved).  He has written in his latest book that Yeshua never told the Jews He was the Messiah, so they are not to be "blamed" for rejecting Him.  Hagee also supports a program that flies Jews to Israel -- but REFUSES to even mention the Gospel to them.  This is the equivalent of giving a Jew a plane ticket and saying "now go to Hell, because I don't love you enough to preach about Yeshua to you."  He speaks with an authoritative tone, but when you analyze what he's saying, you realize he's a false teacher.<br>  <br>  So what can you do to protect yourself?  STUDY THE SCRIPTURES.  And I don't mean merely read them.  I mean earnestly STUDY them, look at the Koine Greek or Hebrew words to get the deeper meaning; study the historical references to understand the background; read REPUTABLE commentaries; DEVOTE YOUR LIFE TO LEARNING THE TRUE WORD.<br>  <br>  Why?  Because someone who knows what the real thing looks like will NOT be fooled by what is false.<br>  <br>  To get you on the right track, I recommend you buy one (or both, preferably) of these books:<br>  <br>  "Systematic Theology:  An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine," by Dr. Wayne Grudem.

If they teach grace alone by faith alone in Jesus alone without works, then they are real.  If they teach works, then they are false. <br>  <br>  Also check to see if they are constantly asking for money.  Someone that is constantly asking for money, is probably not real either.|`|YX4y4vCfaa	Send me $100 and I can give you a video that will explain your question through the word of God.|`|htVmrSDsaa	I think it really has a lot to do with how good you are discerning things and that should be for God to show you.

He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing"  John 15:5  We can tell by what a Christian does with his/her "fruit" - whether we spread the Good News, or like rotting fruit on a vine, do not share with so many in this world that are so very lost.. there are some "evangelists"  (I use the term loosely) that are not truly Men of God and do not do as He commands; there also are Pastors, like the ones we know in the Calvary Chapel ministries, that teach the Bible word for word, and precept upon precept, that are genuine Followers and sheep of our Great Shepherd. May the Lord bless you with guidance, wisdom, and discernment :}
AA11135281	Yes, I believe places of worship should be able to choose what marriages they will allow or disallow.  The First Amendment denies the government the power to interfere.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	The first amendment gives churches the right to marry who they want.  Look at the Catholic Church which refuses to marry those who are divorced.  Militant anti-gay activists want everyone to believe that we gay people will force churches to marry us, but that is a lie.  We won't and we cannot anyway.<br>  <br>  The first amendment, however, does not give churches the right to take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans as well as the religious rights of churches which support same-sex marriage which is what they are doing with laws like Prop. 8.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The churches can. For example, those churches opposed to interracial marriage (and there are some), are not obligated to perform such marriages.<br>  <br>  Where same-sex marriage is legal, churches opposed are not obligated to perform them.<br>  <br>  For the state to discriminate, however, is unconstitutional.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Heaven Bound: Wrong! Just show me the God who spews such bigotry and we'll talk.<br>  <br>  Consenting adults should have martial rights.Always have.|`|M6VcuiyDaa	The churches can allow/disallow whomever they want, but then again nobody is required to get married in a church.<br>  <br>  I agree with you in that a marriage should be personal and not legally recognized for anyone, and anyone who wants the legal benefits should have to get a Civil Union, and I mean everyone.|`|gLyD1CiIaa	Certainly it is the right of the church to determine who gets married in their church. <br>  <br>  It is their job to recognize that marriages between those of the same sex is wrong and should not be permitted. To do otherwise is to disobey the Word of God. <br>  <br>  The world can call it what it pleases, whether bigotry, discrimination or hate mongers. <br>  <br>  Yet, the point that remains is this. It is God who we all will answer to in the end. It is he who determines if a man has lived a righteous life while on earth through faith in his Son. And it is God who will judge the hearts of men.|`|IYe1TTwYaa	Individual people voted already about their stand on marriage.

I support gay marriage though, and there's plenty of churches who aren't hateful like that...|`|iqyb3CIVaa	i concur<br>  as long as the 1st amendment stands, any religious organization has the right to deny anything to be done in a church.<br>  However, as you say, they should have no power over the governments decisions.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	yup, I sure do.

She's a Star. Her song "People" should be on a standards top 100 list. My favorite song in the movie though was "Nobody's gonna rain on my parade". She swept you along with her.|`|XEbrGfZuaa	She was my favorite female singer at the peak of her career, when she<br>  was young. I enjoyed all but one of her movies, and that was Yentl.<br>  My favorites were Funny Girl, and Funny Lady. I thought the chemistry<br>  between she and Omar Shariff, in Funny Girl, awesome. It seemed to<br>  be a wonderful movie, about two wonderful (on screen) people. I <br>  wish I'd been able to see more of what the real "funny lady" was like<br>  in her day, in the Follies and later on radio and stage. I know she <br>  wasn't pretty, but I have heard she had a great personality. And that<br>  was what made her so successful as well as her talent to make<br>  people laugh.<br>     I have been very disappointed that Barbara has been mostly out of<br>  the limelight since her last movie. And has only been seen at <br>  special appearances. I feel she let down her fans, by pretty much<br>  retiring at such a young age. But that's what she's chosen to do and<br>  perhaps she's healthier for it today. And maybe happier as well.|`|ozwLZwXeaa	I know nothing about her personal life but I feel she is one of a kind with her music. Her voice is truly a musical instrument like none other.

D1NWb2mfaa	Getting fired is always the worst option.  Especially, if you intentionally try to get fired.  People quit their jobs all the time and are not necessaritly labeled as "quitters". A "quitter" is typically defined as a person that refuses to make an effort to achieve an attainable goal.  Clearly, that is not what you are doing!<br>  In any workplace environment, it is essential that he/she is comfortable with the personnel with whom he/she is working, as well as the environment is which he/she is working.  Being comfortable with the co-workers and the environment, allows that person to perform at his/her best; which is good for the employer & what the employoer wants from his/her employees (i.e. their best performance).  Unhappy workers yields less than optimal performance (i.e. poor performance).<br>  <br>  People quit jobs all the time under those very reasons.  You can't give your best effort if you don't even like being there.  If you are truly unhappy there, you would be doing both you & your employer a favor by quitting.  Then the employer could try to replace you with someone that DOES feel comfortable with the co-workers & environment.<br>  <br>  Being fired (especially on purpose) can only result in giving you a bad, and unprofessional image; implyng that YOU had to have done something very wrong to get yourself fired. You never want to give THAT impression. It's called "burning a bridge".  It's a small world, and unless you plan on leaving the area where you live, there's always the possibility or coming across someone from that company, in the future; where they would remember you for being "fired".  THAT could end up biting you in the butt at some point.  <br>  <br>  While being fired looks bad in a resume (as a 2nd job, you wouldn't need to add it to your resume).<br>  <br>  The GOOD news is, since you state that it's a 2nd job, you wouldn't need to put it on your resume anyway.  <br>  The BAD news is, since it IS a 2nd job, you would NOT be eligible for unemployment!  <br>  <br>  Bottom line:  If you are uncomfortable or just unhappy at your 2nd job, 1. Speak with your supervisor to let them know your feelings, or <br>  2. Just give your 2 weeks (or 1 week) notice and leave.  You are NOT obligated to give a reason, or rather a "truthful" reason.  You can give any reason...and you won't be considered a QUITTER!<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever you choose!|`|LzJMaw2Iaa	You can always justify quitting a job by explaining that, as it turned out, the company simply wasn't a good match for you  or that the position wasn't anything you were lead to believe.  It's even easier to explain later if you quit during your probation period when you first start the new job.  On the other hand, getting fired means that there was something in your performance and/or behavior that was unacceptable or not up to par which may cause concern for potential future employers.  And if you really think about, what potential employer is going to be comforted by the fact that you allowed yourself to be fired because it was easier than quitting?<br>  <br>  Suck it up and tell your supervisor or whoever you report to that the position isn't working out the way you expected and that a particular date will be your last day with the company.  You'll save face with the company, future employers, and yourself.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	If you quit, you do not get unemployment, if you do something to get fired, that will not look good on your resume, but since you haven't been there long anyway, it's six of one half a dozen of another, at least get another job before you quit this one.|`|zNjACkxpaa	from the perspective of finding another job it is better to quit.<br>  <br>  From the perspective of collecting benefits it is better to be fired.<br>  <br>  Find a new job and then tender your resignation.|`|pZSZUhXNaa	better to be honest.<br>  better to quit than get fired.  <br>  give them the courtesy of a 2 week notice.<br>  and the opportunity to find someone who is a better fit.<br>  think of all the unemployed people right now....|`|AdFucadgaa	If your not happy anymore of your job, better you quit than get fired, you'll have a bad record the next time you find one if fired.|`|cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	It is better on your record to quit.  Getting fired looks worse--like you did a poor job which is not good on your work record.|`|gT9k3Z43aa	Im the same as you! I felt so guilty quitting my first job, but Im glad I did it. Im no job expert, but Im almost positive quitting is better than getting fired;)

VsamHLPOaa	Yes in the beginning than worry turns to dread the longer your there. Or at least the last few jobs I've had. LOL.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	I used but that was like the first week I started. I've had the same job for a year in May and now I don't even think about it.|`|kH8R2ByLaa	You do in the begining. This is natural. It is because people naturally have a fear of the unknown. But once the unkown becomes known to you,( this process depends on the person, and the type of job you have, it could take from just one working day to several months, maybe even in the year or years category for some of the more socially innept.) you will become more comfortable with your surroundings and eviornment, knowing what you must and or need to do and feel confident in your ability to complete the tasks you are set forth to complete.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  <br>  Shine on <br>  <br>  Courtland|`|spZ35om7aa	Have you just started this job recently?<br>  Maybe its just new job jitters or perhaps its a job you're not very comfortable with in which case i have had the same experience. I used to work for a Real Estate company that had me telling bold face lies to people just to get them to sell their homes or to look for new ones. These were sometimes old people who would believe "the nice gentleman on the phone" or hard up families who i was just harassing. Needless to say i have since changed careers and no longer get the nerves <br>  <br>  Hope that was some help

LCAXc8S5aa	One proof is that the prophetic word Moses spoke over 3400 years ago has been fulfilled in this day and age:<br>  <br>   "When all these blessings and curses I have set before you (the Israelites) come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the LORD your God disperses you among the nations,  and when you and your children return to the LORD your God and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything I command you today,  then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes  and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you. Even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens, from there the LORD your God will gather you and bring you back.  He will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers (the Land of Israel), and you will take possession of it. He will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers."<br>  <br>  This has been fulfilled - the Jews were scattered for hundreds of years, yet they retained their unique identity as a people group, and have returned to the land they were exiled from some 1900 years earlier.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a coincidence, and anyone who does is not very bright in my opinion.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	"Because the Bible says so"<br>  Haha<br>  <br>  -Atheist|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Because GOD says so<br>  <br>  Num 23:19 God [is] not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do [it]? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Because the Bible was written under Inspiration From God.|`|CnqGu1Taaa	God saved them,Moses was a vessel|`|JyAUAbsjaa	Faith my friend, faith.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Because the bible tells us so.  If that ain't good enough for you, what is?|`|lJUyhMceaa	As far as Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt, we have many writings that speak of it, not just Religious writings, but many secular writings as well.<br>  <br>  Regarding your first question, we know by faith, and the fact that there is absolutely nothing to suggest that he DID NOT hear from God.  Everything that he recorded that God said, was, in fact, correct.  <br>  <br>  For example, there are many writing in different religions, and in secular writings to support the Biblical story regarding the different plagues that Moses prayed down on the Pharaoh.  This being true, it is pretty obvious that Moses was not acting alone.  God was with him, and telling him what to do.<br>  <br>  But, unless you chose to believe the Bible, and believe in God, this won't mean anything.  A person who does not want to believe in the Bible and in God, will find something else to believe in.  So, in reality, it all boils down to faith.|`|RuOTJLyvaa	Yeah isn't it weird how everytime people hear the voice of God it's someplace remote and isolated...when no body else is around.|`|l5AOEcZ4aa	Moses didn't save anyone god did but used moses as his Vessel.|`|6jAVElX7aa	Do you suppose that mere men could have given those ten commandments in those days, or even today?|`|45Mmu3SFaa	God said it and I believe it...I don't need proof the bible is enough proof  for me.....|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	by faith he heard god's voice|`|wukXoRCMaa	we don't<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  the bible is not proof...|`|htVmrSDsaa	Because the same reason we have no clue if there was once one planet called Pangea but later spread out into 7 continents, but we are not sure about that.

QM2UqZmuaa	Write a list of all the bad things he did to you (such as when viewed by police). Everything that could be of sexual harassment or when he physically hit you, like he did to your arm 1 day on purpose.<br>  <br>  As more and more events happen as the days go by, your list should grow bigger and bigger. Imagine, what you can do 1 day, when you unleash it. For now, you can keep an updating list on a blog site for your friends to see. You can even make a page dedicated to all the bad things he's done to you, and not just to you, but to all the other women.<br>  <br>  You see, the more and more you do nothing about it (which is what I'm currently advising you), the more and more he'll trust you, and then, the more and more worse things he will do, which will just be perfect for the police report! What do you have to lose? If he talks about his penis 1 day, write it down. All the incriminating evidence will go against him. (I personally carry a digital recorder or camera in case I want to record other people's conversations to me. I have done so sucessfully.)<br>  <br>  And now to answer your specific questions:<br>  <br>  "I'm starting to think that he's slightly mentally challenged because that behavior is sort of weird... [...] It just feels rude because what if he has something wrong with him and he can't help it?"<br>  <br>  2 things:<br>  <br>  1.)Does it make you feel any better if you found out he actually has a personality disorder causing him to be that way?<br>  <br>  2.)Maybe he's testing you. You will have to observe how he is with guys...|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Whatever his mental ability is, it does not give him any excuse to harass you, you need to immediately tell your teacher and the Principal and your parents, and he needs to be told to back off or be removed from the school in the meantime steer way clear of him he could be dangerous.|`|gT9k3Z43aa	wow, that is weird. I don't think he has a mental problem necessarily, but he's probably just trying to get you to notice him and get attention, maybe he likes you? If I were in your position, I would ignore it- don't look at him when he bumps you, don't look at his computer anymore, and don't sit beside him if you can help it;)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YuUNESK5aa	just ignore him. He either likes you or just like messing with people.<br>  If it continues and starts to really bother you, get a teacher or someone to get him to stop.|`|4zY5xSKyaa	Tell him to leave you alone, and if he begins to say anything other than "ok", then interrupt him with "please leave me alone"|`|mPgkMUKBaa	you shouldn't ignore him. I mean i know it seems weird when he comes up to you, just put him in your place if you saw this guy that you liked and you came up and started talking to him and he just walked off. I'm pretty sure you will feel extremely bad. So im not saying be his friend if you don't want to but at least don't ignore him or say anything harsh because im sure you wouldn't like that if it happened to you<br>  <br>  Golden Rule: Do onto others as you want others to do onto you.

ANOBEJPXaa	She needs to get her priorities straight. She needs to choose between to choices: One; she can be a good girlfriend and stop seeing other boys, or two; she can move on. I know it's hard, but you really need to just flat out ask her if you're worth it. Ask her if she's really capable of having you be her one and only. If you don't get the answer you want out of her, then you need to realize that you're not ever going to, and that it's time to move on. That can be the hardest thing in the world, I know. But if she's not the one, then she's not the one. There'll be somebody out there for you, I promise. ^^|`|MWIKAz9Oaa	That's so cute! Sorry, this is not helping in any way...

Also, that same day I saw those "ships" I started asking the people I was with out side and they said they saw and heard anything (and it was very loud).

Tmm7TUiHaa	I dont see why it should be haram. I have had microdermabrasion done. I'm thinking this is the same thing its just called microdermabrasion in UK. And previous to that I took Roaccutane(Accutane) again called slightly different name. That was a great great success. I think Roaccutane saved my face. The acne hasnt come back either.|`|3E2EQH12aa	i agree with Wazgud. its not like a nose job or something, u arent changing the way that Allah created your face... youre just "fixing" something that troubles you, and i dont think there is anything wrong with that as far as quran/sunnah goes. its like getting into a bad accident and losing an arm. . do you say , oh , its what Allah decreed, and throw the arm in the medical waste bin, or do you say modern medicine will allow me to have my arm back, please do the surgery asap.. ? yep..thats what i thought.|`|Ztiy3jjwaa	Before going ahead, be properly diagnosed by a dermatologist and the appropriate treatment can be selected.<br>  Make sure any treatment that you may decide to use is done by a trained professional and the correct type of laser therapy is used for the ance scars.<br>  Treatment for scarring and acne is not Makrooh.<br>  Makrook meaning not liked or favoured action which is nearer to Haraam.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	if you can afford it, i don't think it's haram b/c it's just like intensive exfoliation<br>  <br>  you're not ruining the shape of your face or God-given features, right?<br>  <br>  It would be best if you used more natural methods...i'm not so sure about this issue<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Peace<br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's not haram to do something that will improve your self-image and self-esteem.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I do not recommend Accutane except for last resort.|`|qky7gWosaa	I used to have several scars on my chest and I applied a paste of turmeric, gram flour and lemon juice on it before I went to bed. The scars completely disappeared in one month. Just a tip =)<br>  <br>  The best way to treat acne scars is to go to a dermatologist obviously. This is because at the skin care centre, your skin would be put for testing and the real cause of the not-proper healing could be found, and the dermatologist would also be able to find the type of acne scar that you have. This is actually not so known to everyone, that there are actually many different types of acne scars, and each one of them have its own different method of curing or removal. Besides just looking at the type of scar, your age, tolerance for medications and therapies, physical health and medical history would also be taken into consideration, because most of the acne scar medications are pretty strong, and can have side effects if applied on wrong skin which do not have the tolerance power or even the immunity to protect against the side effect caused by the medications.<br>  <br>  -It is not Har'am, as long as your intention is clear. Acne scars are more distracting than acne, and I can understand that no-one can live with them eternally. I am sure Allah (Swt) focuses more on piety than how we look and what we do to ourselves externally.<br>  <br>  -The dermatologists prescribe Accutane for relentless acne conditions and i have heard it is a disappointment due to major side effects such as severe headaches and painful joints. Accutane will cure Acne, but i doubt it will heal the acne scars. So it is best to stick with dermabrasion.|`|QS2xW3jUaa	Salam alaykum,<br>  <br>  It is absolutely not haram. Only this kind of actions which change your body shape, size, looking, colour etc (changing the organism features) are forbidden. What's more, if your intention is to be beautiful for your husband, it is even highly recommended!<br>  <br>  I asked recently about whitening the teeth, and I got a reply from reliable source that it is halal. Explanation was the same as I told you above - with intention to be beautiful for your husband (not to use this beauty for doing haram things) it is allowed.<br>  <br>  So, as far as this kind of "operation" will not affect your health, you can feel free to do this.

Islam is a matriarchal religion, that is, the woman is the dominant power.  The man works, and the woman stays home, and is a housewife, because the man believes the woman doesn't need to work.

a6wPnHRQaa	Well it comes between the ages of 10 and 16 so you can wait a little while longer. <br>  You could ask your mom when she got hers because sometimes girls who's mom also got it later than average will get there's just as late. sometimes girls underweight/under stress/have an illness will have a little delay also. <br>  <br>  If you're really worried though you can see a gynecologist. <br>  But I don't think you have anything wrong :-)
87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	There are quite a few mistakes in this, and placing your accent marks for you wouldn't do much help to correct it. If you have time, perhaps you re-post this with the English version so it can be corrected first. Sorry.
wnSvjwWuaa	The simple answer (therefore makes it the hardest) is "Only you can say for sure what to do".<br>  <br>  That is the plain, simple truth.<br>  <br>  I don't know you well enough, your situation, the length and depth of your relationship with your ex, your family, their religious views, your own religious views, what your attitude towards sex is like...I think this list alone will tell you that I, nor anyone else here, can really qualify to give you the "best advice" what to do.<br>  <br>  All I can do is share my experience and maybe you can choose to pick some things up from it, discard it totally, etc.<br>  <br>  I was raised in a conservative Baptist family, sent to the same type of school and went to church (I attended Sunday school AND attended the adult Bible worship service after). That is how indoctrinated I was, yet by age 9, I knew from the first crush I had (Patrick from Canada), that I was gay, and I AM gay. Nothing any biblical admonition could threaten was "converting" me to heterosexuality. I could NOT help these feelings I have. I certainly didn't ASK for them.<br>  <br>  In fact, around my teen years, when everyone was beginning to pair up in high school (boy-girl, of course) I got down on my knees, cried so hard, prayed to God and asked Him to take away these feelings of attraction to other boys. It never happened, and I understand it now. There is NOTHING WRONG with my feelings - how can I be judged for something I have no control of?<br>  <br>  Yes, I ended up having really nasty arguments, especially with my mom and sister, until it was really unbearable living with them that I got a job, moved out, and forged my own life. I don't recommend you do the same, but being as strong willed and headstrong as I am, I knew there was no way I would back down from any argument that would be thrown in my face, and for my peace of mind, I left.<br>  <br>  11 years later, I'm still with my partner (of 11 years!), my mom has come around to at least acknowledging my presence, and wanting to see me for lunch on Sundays. It's not the "ideal" situation, but if you knew my mom, you know that this is a HUGE deal (being a Chinese family AND conservative Baptist, just imagine what she grew up with and believed as facts). I try to place myself in her shoes and know that this is going against everything she believed in, and I admire her for at least trying to want to get to know me again - even if it sometimes comes home to an invitation to go to church with her, but as an adult, she can't force me to do anything, and that is a big comfort.<br>  <br>  I don't know your age, how you are financially, etc., again it goes back to the fact that I don't know you well enough to give you advice on what to do, but I hope my own experience can give you something to mull over, and for me, the fact that I am happy with my life, and not living it so that other people will feel "comfortable", has been a decision I will always stand proudly by.<br>  <br>  I wish you happiness, and wisdom to know what to do.|`|Zp93fab3aa	You must stop trying to please those around you.  Its your life and you are free to live in however you please with whomever you please.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	Just be you. Don't try to please everybody else. It just makes you unhappy. If you like girls then you like girls. :]|`|fkrnlbexaa	I'm sure your family knows how you truly feel, but just tries to ignore it. It is easier to ignore a problem you know...<br>  <br>  My opinion is that you should have the courage to be happy. Put your family in front of the fact. You are gay/bisexual and there is nothing they can do about it. Start dating gurls again, and don't worry about the church, gay is not a sin, it is just contrary to the church beliefs.<br>  <br>  Have the courage to be happy gurl....|`|Eo9ZdKqvaa	dont make yourself unhappy, go ahead and do what you want. dont worry about the hell thing.  if you feel comfortable about the whole lesbian thing, go for it. im a christian, but i dont know what to do about it. i just am because my parents are. i dont wana go to hell, but if you think about it, one sin doesn't give you to satan. im pretty sure sex is a sin, but sex doesn't give you an automatic ticket to hell.  god forgives. go for the girls if you like them better.|`|cbY6NoHSaa	Do it this is your life not theirs, live it, damn it!

Be true to yourself. <br>  <br>  If you genuinely are attracted to some men and find yourself checking some men out, you're bisexual.|`|m5fuOGAiaa	If there is a hell (and there probably isn't), you'd be more likely to go there for trying to force yourself to be something your not.<br>  <br>  There is probably nothing wrong with you and liking girls isn't wrong or a big deal.

AEMTb3vdaa	On a personal level one can do very little about politics, however some people take it very seriously and think that they know all facets of every level of politics.  Additionally, people are pushed to take sides in partisan politics, and many times feel very strongly about party loyalty; therefore, it is best not to bring that type of subject up while trying to eat a meal.  It can so easily turn into an argument.  Also, people tend to usually only discuss the bad points of any political situation and not the positive aspects.|`|AA11656721	I found that this subject may cause friction even in the family.  Best to keep this subject out of the family dinner conversation.  Families need to get together to be close and happy.  Dinner time is a great time to do this.

7d2e1c957453fc8d4829969618e83382aa	I feel your pain! I love Spanish language, but HATE literature classes (in any language, really). What I ended up doing was double majoring in Linguistics and Spanish. At my school (Temple University), the Spanish major has 3 tracks you can choose from, and one of them is a linguistics track--Score!  :)<br>  <br>  I may be biased as a language major, but I definitely definitely definitely recommend at least minoring in a language! When you have official paperwork from a college or university saying you're proficient in a language, it often weighs more than if you did it on your own for free, like you said, and don't have accredited documentation. And with proficiency in another language, you'll be able to get more jobs! Being proficient in a language LARGELY increases your chances of getting a job because of the high demand for speakers of other languages!<br>  <br>  So my final verdict is to at least minor, or double major in a language and something else you love. Good luck!  :)|`|R42mL1p2aa	My personal advice would be to major in them if you really enjoy them...it will open up alot of doors in terms of foreign study..and i know you say you can do it for free but i've tried to learn Italian..another Latin based romance language..and its just not the same as getting properly taught...im sure there are classes that focus on the language side rather than the litratuure....Overall i think if your doing ok on your own then go for it...i dont want to limit you to my abilities! but if you have an extra space you should definetly consider picking one up! im a french Major and i love it!!|`|mFKUAgglaa	When you major in a langauge, you are not just majoring in the language itself but also the culture and history. It's a full course. The only time it's different is if it is a French lit major.

HEf129Hvaa	In the United States no, in the rest of the world yes.  The language originally spoken in Italy, Spain,etc. was Latin (hence, Latino).  Latin America is called that because of the Spaniards and other Europeans who had/have Latin roots and migrated there.  <br>  Of course, this will probably fly over too many heads, and I'll probably get a thousand thumbs down, but I could care less.   <br>  <br>  I live in Italy|`|cb88569354fa813399bd99b338324ae4aa	Not latino, but they are considered LATIN. Why? It all starts back when a language called Latin emerged in Europe. Since latin died out other languages stemmed off of it like Spanish, Italian, French, Romanian, Portuguese and other minor ones like Catalan, Galician etc. Anyone who speaks these languages and is BORN in a country whose main customs and language are of the ones listed above is classified as Latin throughout the world. There is a difference though: people from spanish speaking countries (including spain) are considered Hispanic bc of the spanish culture. Also, countries that speak a latin-derived language in the continent of America south of the U.S. are considered the continent of LATIN AMERICA. Outside of the U.S., us hispanics dont really call ourselves latinos, we call ourselves latin-americans because of said reasons above. If we were to call ourselves latinos, it would a confusion between the european countries that speak a latin-derived language and the countries in Latin-America. However in the U.S., we have been classified differently due to other types of confusion this would cause.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	I was always under the impression that the term Latino referred to anyone of Latin America rather than those peoples originating in theLatin speaking world.<br>  So I would classify Italian as European and Mexican, Peruvians, etc. as Latinos; but not Brazilians which are Portuguese.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	No, they're not from Latin America. They're White Europeans. While a Latino can be mixed Italian, unless and Italian is specifically mixed with Latinp heritage, they are not Latino.|`|fusc1cykaa	No....they are white. Italy is in Europe.|`|ATCjFVRAaa	Not by the American definition.  Italians are part of the European group known as Latins which also includes Spaniards, French and Portuguese. They are refered to as Latins because they all share a common Roman heritage and speak Latin based languages. <br>  <br>  The Italian (or Spanish) word for Latin is Latino but it doesn't refer to the same group of people as it does in America.  <br>  <br>  The common American definition of "Latino" refers mostly to Spanish speaking people that have Latin American ancestry - either currently living in Latin America or in the U.S.  <br>  <br>  Latin America was explored and colonized by The Spanish and Portuguese - European Latins who introduced their Latin based languages and cultures to the region, it's native people and also to the African Slaves that they imported to the New World. <br>  <br>  Most (but not all) New World Latinos are of mixed race and have very little in common with the original European Spanish and Portuguese settlers.<br>  <br>  So Italians are Latins but not necessarily "Latino".|`|OOP6Hesyaa	Italians are not Latins or Latino.

V9d3qnUiaa	In terms of people, I think we've become better. We are more sympathetic towards human suffering and animal suffering, and for the most part we do try to help. Our laws have become more humane too (dependent on the culture). I mean, it wasn't too long ago that people were drowned, boiled, stoned and burnt alive...so I think we've gotten better in that department. <br>  <br>  We have also changed what constitutes a hero. Before, heroes were generals - the stronger and meaner you were, the bigger the hero. Now, a hero can be a common person, who does good.<br>  <br>  In terms of the world, the three things I find worst is: how we treat the earth, how materialistic the "individual" has become, and how we keep creating monstrous war technology. <br>  <br>  However, I feel that the best thing about us "now" is that we know what we do wrong, and we are trying to change that...little by little.<br>  <br>  LM|`|d625e50e2f5b3add3c58e3d7531fd74caa	I think that depends upon your personal situation at the time you answer this question. Your judgment would obviously be influenced by your finances, love life, employment opportunities and many other factors. So I guess I'm saying that for some it's better and for some it's worse. Frankly, that's the way it's always been.

We eat and drink like normal people, garlic and all.<br>  As some real vampires are christian, crosses, holy water have no effect. The sun can make us feel fatigued, and often we will get burnt A lot quicker than others and We do not sleep in coffins.<br>  Generally we are exactly like normal human beings except for some reason our bodies do not generate enough Prana (Chi, Life force, etc) so we need to take it from outside sources which is where our talent for energy manipulation comes in. While for some they can not use energy work the way psi vampires do, so they get the same life force from consuming small amounts of blood.|`|TQOVizbsaa	Only inmature clods "believe" vampires are real. As phony balony as the "Count Duckular" cartoons. Get real!<br>  P.D.: And thanks for the demerit. Quite a compliment!|`|qDYzdz5daa	There aren't any vampires.<br>  <br>  There are people who claim to enjoy / crave human blood. They are not "sanguinarian vampires," they are "freaky creepy disturbed people."<br>  <br>  There are people who claim to be able to sap the energy from other people. They are not "psychic vampires," they are "boring."<br>  <br>  There are people who claim to BE vampires. "Real," Bram-Stoker, Anne-Rice, or Twilight ones. They are not "real vampires" they are "people who can't tell the difference between fantasy and reality."|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Vampires are indeed fasinating, but sorry to disappoint you. So far, I only have knowledge of the Psychic vampires, and I doubt the media ones. This type of Vampirism is something you are born with. Genetic, I believe. However, one is not aware of it until they reach an Awakening, which normally occurs around 15-16. No superpowers or anything. They are technically human, yes humans, that have an energy deficiency and have to get 'extra' energy from someone else. There's the psychic kind, which feed on a person's energy. There's also the actually blood drinkers that get the it from donors. They can be beautiful, but it depends on genetics, just like any other human. They can be strong, but they have to work at it, like any other human. They don't have a phobia of garlic or anything. Get the point?|`|GROkWyBAaa	Myth. Twilight is a fictional book for a reason.|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	since they are considered to be undead, zombie things<br>  no they are not real|`|tgPNbZSvaa	Vampires? We are real. We are "normal" people that are pale and have a mild allergicity to the sun. We don't "glitter" as people say we do. Vampires barely drink blood anymore unless we need to. Drinking blood was the traditional way to acquire energy from others but we learned how to get energy by psychicly taking it. We are more attractive than other species of human. We can't transform and are better runners than normal humans for hunting reasons. We don't live forever, we live longer and it looks like forever because we outlive you. And I'm sorry but a turning is physically impossible.|`|6q2Uyb1Baa	Real vampires are very different from what most people think of when they think of vampires.  We are not supernatural beings who turn into bats and suck the blood from the living.  We do drink blood, but that may be the only similarity to fictional vampires.  We have family and friends, pets and jobs just like everyone else.  Vampires are just like everyone else, except we need to have a little bit more to live healthily.  <br>  There are two main types of real vampires.  The most well known is the sanguinarian vampire.  Sanguinarians are the vampires that feel the need to drink the blood of others.  I myself am a sanguinarian vampire.  I do drink human blood.  I do not hunt humans in the night to drain them of blood, nor do I kill rats in the sewer to consume their blood.  Sanguinarians only get their blood from WILLING donors.  I drink from my fiancé.  I myself, enjoy sucking blood, so I will use a sterile razor blade  to make a small cut on her arm or her back and I will lap up the blood.  Some vampires use other methods to get their blood.  I do not drink blood every day.  <br>  The other type of vampire is the psychic vampire.  Psychic vampires, I do not know much about, but they feed off the psychic energy that everyone gives off.  They have some way in which they draw peoples energy away from them and into their bodies.  <br>  We cannot turn someone into a vampire.  You have to be born a vampire.  No one bit me, and I have never bit anyone (aside from my fiancé, in the bedroom *wink wink*).  There is no known way to turn someone, and even if we could, it would be no different from the life a person already lives.  <br>  Vampires are not like story books and movies, however.  Vampires cannot fly (except on an airplane), we do not live forever, we do not turn into bats and fly around, we do not fry like a piece of chicken in the sunlight, we do not fear the cross or run for the wind from garlic.  We have reflections and we are in every sense, just like regular people.  We will die if we get shot, just like everyone else, we bleed, we cry, we love, we pray.  We come in every shape, color, size, and age just like everyone else.  There are ugly vampires, and pretty vampires, fat and thin vampires, black and white vampires, old and young vampires, Christian and Jewish vampires, and gay and straight vampires.  We get colds, and the flu, suffer arthritis and cancer.  We are not immune to any disease.  We have normal jobs.  <br>  I hope this helps you better understand real vampires.  There are many websites that you can find more information.  You can also email me.  I will respond as soon as I can to any questions.|`|wyXCRGv6aa	their real. as are werwolves. they know a lot bcuz a lot of them have been around for a few centuries. they kill ppl all the time. as do werewolves, but while werewolves are huge and ferocious, they an only go crazy once of twice a month. vampires don't kill every night, maybe every 3-4 nights. they are indeed charming, and while obviously dangerous, ppl go in w/ them anyway. that irresistable charm. yea their real. im a awakening vampire.|`|1qkl3BNzaa	The whole vampire mythology is based off accounts of poor medical practices in the past where people were buried alive, woke up in coffins, scratched at the wood and ate the burial shroud in desperation, then finally died of suffocation.

She came up to the house and said oooooooo (o-conjugate for yo). She walked into the house and found her friend who was in the kitchen. They found a box in the kitchen and saw food in it. They wanted to open it so they went and found an ax (as-the conjugate for tu). They went back to the box and smashed it open. The looked in the box and said aaaaaaaa (a-the conjugate for el/ella). Inside were some Famous Amos cookies.(amos-the conjugate for nosotros). They heard something outside and tookm the cookies. They say many kids playing and there were two little girls away from the others. They went over and asked them their names. The first one said "My name is Ann" (an-the conjugate for ustedes). They asked the other little girl and she said her name was ann too. (an-the conjugate for Ellos/Ellas).<br>  <br>  They took the cookies inside with the little girls and shared the cookies.<br>  <br>  It always helps me to remember so...<br>  <br>  (example-estar)<br>  <br>  Yo-(ooooooo) estO<br>  Tu-(ax-as) estAS<br>  El-(aaaaaa) estA<br>  Nosotros-(Famous AMOS)-estAMOS<br>  Ustedes-(1st girl-Ann)-estAN<br>  Ellos-(2nd girl-Ann)-estAN<br>  <br>  I hope you can understand this!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.

At least every week my priest says all are welcome at the table of the Lord. <br>  I know in the Roman Catholic church you have to belong to get it.|`|AA11440601	At the Last Supper, Jesus said, “Take this bread. It is my body.” The he said, “Take this and drink. This is my blood. Do this in memory of me.” <br>  <br>  Catholics believe this was the First Eucharist, that through some miracle the bread and wine actually became the body and blood of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Catholics reenact the Last Supper during every Mass, where the priest, acting in place of Christ, changes the bread and wine into the body and blood of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  This is a great sacrament of thanksgiving and unity of Catholics.<br>  <br>  Anyone who does not believe in the actual presence of Christ and is not united with the Catholic faith is asked, out of respect, not to receive the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Catholics, out of respect for other Christian faiths, do not receive Communion in non-Catholic churches.<br>  <br>  We pray that one day Christian unity will succeed and we will all be called to the same table.<br>  <br>  For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, sections 1322 and following: <a href="http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2sect2chpt1art3.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt2s...</a><br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	Sorry, but no, I don't agree with you on this. To begin with, most non-Catholics don't believe that the Eucharist is literally the Body and Blood of Christ. They see Communion as symbolic or as a memorial. As a result, they are not truly in communion with the body of Catholic believers.<br>  <br>  As far as whether or not Jesus would have limited Communion, the answer to that is very clear: yes, He would. The reason we know this is because when He first instituted the Eucharist and told His followers that they would be partaking of His Body and Blood, many of them thought that He was being too harsh, and they left Him.<br>  <br>  He could have called them back and said, "Hey, guys, I was just kidding about the Body and Blood part. It's all just a symbol, so no need to get upset." The fact is that He didn't correct His earlier saying, so if someone was about to receive Communion unworthily, He would not have permitted it -- any more than you would allow someone to just take a kidney or a cornea from you without your permission.<br>  <br>  Scripture also speaks about what happens to those who unworthily receive Christ in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. Paul says that some of the early believers were struck with illness and some had died because they didn't approach the Sacrament with the solemnity and respect that the Eucharist deserves.<br>  <br>  As a practicing Catholic, I would not wish to participate in a Communion service with people who don't agree with my Catholic Faith -- not because I don't love them and consider them to be brothers and sisters in Christ. Imposing myself on them when I am not in communion with them would be disrespectful and unkind. <br>  <br>  That's why I hope others would also respect the beliefs of my Church concerning the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  Do you shove a chunk of steak down a baby's throat or expect a toddler to eat a whole fish, bones and all? No, because they cannot benefit from the food that they're receiving and may end up choking and dying on what you're trying to feed them.<br>  <br>  Many non-believers may have good intentions, but that won't matter if they receive the Body and Blood of Jesus without being spiritually ready for it. What feeds and nourishes a Catholic believer could be the spiritual equivalent of trying to feed a baby solid food before it can chew.|`|AA10034051	First, we must understand what the Eucharist is:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  John 6:53-56. So Jesus said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the beginning of understanding Holy Communion which was instituted at the Last Supper (Matt 26:26, Mk 15:22-24, Luke 22:19-20). Communion is the celebration of the Eucharist when we consume the body and blood of Christ. It looks like bread and wine, however during mass it is transformed into the body and blood of Christ. This is the central celebration of the Catholic Church. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  One has to be in a state of grace(gone to confession) to receive Eucharist and one also has to believe in the true presence of Christ to partake of the Eucharist.<br>  <br>  Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself." (1 Cor 11:27-29)|`|18be83adf26491424d29aa61ef0530d6aa	If I consider it a simple memorial of the Lord's last supper, which I do, why would I take part in eating his literal body and blood?  Likewise, unless I appreciated and believed it were the literal body/blood, how could a church allow me to partake?  It would be against their teachings.|`|1JsWMX0daa	well, that is what happens when men try to emulate jesus. you cant expect to live your life like jesus and do what jesus did and have the authority that jesus had. jesus is the son of god but most religious leaders of the christian faith are the very sinners that jesus warned of that mislead. they are fools who try to emulate a demigod.|`|AA11466759	“Receive me today, O Son of God, as partaker of Thy Mystical Supper, for I will not speak of Thy Mystery to Thine enemies; neither will I give Thee a kiss as did Judas, but like the thief will I confess Thee:  Remember me, O Lord, in Thy Kingdom.”<br>  <br>  This prayer before communion is still said in the Liturgy of St John Chrysostom.<br>  <a href="http://www.saintjosephorthodox.org/bulletins/2009/sunday_of_the_prodigal_son.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.saintjosephorthodox.org/bulle...</a>|`|KmnbjZIdaa	The eucharist is a form of communion just like making love when two people wanted to express intimacy with each other.  So would you go to bed with anybody who wanted to do it with you?  or do you at least want to know even her name first? but normally an intimate union would require an existing relationship first, isn't it? So if you cannot do it with everybody, then don't expect it from Jesus, who is also human just like you and I.|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Only Catholics have the Sacrament of Confession therefore the splinter groups cannot not be free of sin to receive him.<br>   Receiving Him with knowledge of mortal sin on your soul is a sacrilege.<br>  <br>  P.s. You MUST believe in the true presence also.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Yes, Jesus would have.<br>  <br>   For example, Catholics believe that the bread and wine literally become the body and blood of our Savior.<br>  Communion is an intimate encounter with Christ, in which we sacramentally receive Christ into our bodies, that we may be more completely assimilated into his. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is real food, and my blood is real drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me. This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live forever" (John 6:53–58). <br>  <br>   To receive Communion worthily, you must be in a state of grace, have made a good confession since your last mortal sin, believe in transubstantiation, observe the Eucharistic fast, and, finally, not be under an ecclesiastical censure such as excommunication. <br>  <br>  First, you must be in a state of grace. "Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of profaning the body and blood of the Lord. Let a man examine himself, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup" (1 Cor. 11:27–28). This is an absolute requirement which can never be dispensed. To receive the Eucharist without sanctifying grace in your soul profanes the Eucharist in the most grievous manner. <br>  <br>  The Church’s ancient teaching on this particular matter is expressed in the Didache, an early Christian document written around A.D. 70, which states: "Whosoever is holy [i.e., in a state of sanctifying grace], let him approach. Whosoever is not, let him repent" (Didache 10). <br>  <br>  you must believe in the doctrine of transubstantiation. "For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself" (1 Cor. 11:29). Transubstantiation means more than the Real Presence. According to transubstantiation, the bread and wine are actually transformed into the actual body, blood, soul, and divinity of Christ, with only the appearances of bread and wine remaining. This is why, at the Last Supper, Jesus held what appeared to be bread and wine, yet said: "This is my body. . . . This is my blood" (Mark 14:22-24, cf. Luke 22:14-20). If Christ were merely present along side bread and wine, he would have said "This contains my body. . . . This contains my blood," which he did not say. <br>  <br>  Scripture is clear that partaking of the Eucharist is among the highest signs of Christian unity: "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread" (1 Cor. 10:17). For this reason, it is normally impossible for non-Catholic Christians to receive Holy Communion, for to do so would be to proclaim a unity to exist that, regrettably, does not. <br>  <br>  Another reason that many non-Catholics may not ordinarily receive Communion is for their own protection, since many reject the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Scripture warns that it is very dangerous for one not believing in the Real Presence to receive Communion: "For any one who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment upon himself. That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died" (1 Cor. 11:29–30).|`|lJUyhMceaa	Partaking of the Lord's Supper (Eucharist as some call it), neither "places Christ in you", nor does it "bestow Grace upon it's recipients".<br>  <br>  The Bible is very clear that it only "represents" what Christ did for us.  It's a picture of the Blood that Jesus shed for our sins, and a picture of His body that was broke for us.  The Bible says, "this do in REMEMBRANCE of me".<br>  <br>  The only Biblical requirement in partaking of the Lord's Supper is that you must be a believer in Jesus Christ.  As you pointed out, some Churches like to put other restrictions on it.  The Church I go to does not do this.  They only ask that each person examine themselves to see if you are truly a believer, and then if you want to take the Lord's Supper, that is between you and God.<br>  <br>  I have however been to a few that would not let anyone but members partake of it.  Personally, I thought this was wrong, but each Pastor must do what he feels is right.  They will have to answer to God for it, and since this has nothing to do with salvation, I don't push the issue myself.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The Eucharist - the true Eucharist - is the ultimate expression of the unity of the true Church. Receiving it means "I accept and believe what this body teaches. I am a member of this Church".  Therefore it is inappropriate for those who cannot make those statements to receive it.  Further, it would be a sacrilege to receive the literal body and blood of Christ while thinking you are simply eating a piece of bread. Protestant churches do not have the Eucharist, for the Eucharist can become a reality only through a valid priesthood.  But some of them do have various kinds of symbolic communion services, and some are more strict than others about who may receive it.  The true Eucharist exists only in Catholic and Orthodox churches.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  Given that the Eucharist really is the body of Christ, it is important that it be received with an appropriate understanding of what it is.   The Eucharist is not a snack cracker,  and it is not a mere symbol.   It is in fact the actual body of Jesus Christ.   It is not appropriate to distribute the Eucharist to people who do not understand what the sacrament is.<br>  <br>  In rare cases of emergency,  a bishop can authorize the distribution of this sacrament to a non-Catholic.   It would have to be for good reason, and only with the careful judgment of the bishop.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason the Eucharist is restricted to Catholics is that this sacrament is a celebration of the unity of the Church.  To pretend that all Christians are united when that is not true is a lie.  This would be a mockery of the sacrament.<br>  <br>  I hope and pray that we will all one day be reconciled to God through the One Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.

WHY VOID??? Did some other God screw it?). 6,000 years ago the Earth was in pitch darkness and full of water... so God* (*BTW, the Hebrew word for God is “Elohim” and it stands for a plurality of GODS like the Greeks and Babylonians had! 1 Cor 8:5). So God (Elohim speaking in plural) grabs the Earth and re-creates it, but this time with all the trimmings like “SEPARATING” the waters from the land, which in itself is quite a miracle considering gravitational levels, capacity, and so on! God goes on creating the Sun, the Moon, the stars and the rest of the universe that extends billions of light years away from the Earth (To God’s own credit the light of the most distant observable star or galaxy reached the Earth during the “Creation Week!”) The Bible writers are telling us that everything that God was creating "was good, very good!” But soon enough God had to deal with all kinds of glitches. If all these glitches are multiplied by the number of worlds that we can observe in this universe, God better go looking for a new job! God created man to till a small garden that he planted in the region of Babylon-today's Iraq. Apparently it was here that the writers started to do the script on the Bible. Even the Ark of Noah landed not far from Iraq or rather Babylon. The Bible writers introduced to the Jews a humble God wanting to own a garden on this microscopic speck of dust called Earth at the edge of the Milky Way in this humongous universe! It seems like Christians had to give up their sense of proportion to become Christians! Adam was created in God's image... MALE! It was in that image that Adam was very much focused in finding a help meet or mate for himself among ALL THE ANIMALS that this Bible God created while he was busy name tagging them one by one under God’s supervision. At God’s suggestion Adam must have tried to enjoy sexually who knows how many animals, but even God admitted that for Adam, “NO HELP MATE WAS FOUND”. God admits another glitch in his “very good” creation that creating man alone is "no good" after all (Gen 2:18-20)!<br>  <br>  Please bear in mind that the whole Creation story and the adventures of God and Jesus throughout the Bible were put together by people like many of us. In the Bible script Eve was created as an afterthought after it was proven that no animal was 100% suitable for Adam's pleasure. Modern day Bible scholars insist that the Bible ought not to be taken literally… short of seriously! Originally, Adam must have had either sterile semen or compatible semen that would work on any animal! But that changed when Eve was finally created out of one of Adams’s phallic rib bones. God must have restructured Adam’s sexual reproductive system too…When Eve was introduced to Adam, Adam knew a lot about sex so he was not acting like a nerd with her. Most likely their first sexual arrangement was doggy style... and so on. Christians are very selective on what they wish to believe and force others to believe from the Bible. BTW, when I was questioning some of this stuff in Bible College I was sternly warned not to provoke the wrath of God so I let God, those who have “the rule” over us, and the leading of God the Holy Ghost, or what have you control my thoughts for most of my life totally convinced and with a clear conscience that I was the “clay in the potters hand”! I am not joking! Obviously you don’t need much of an IQ along with a well defined degree of gullibility… oops sorry, faith to successfully attend Christian College and work in the Christian ministry and I was a borderline case. I had unanswered questions and the elaborate commentaries by expert theologians that I was using were of no help at all! No Preacher can depend on the Bible alone to represent his/her brand of Christianity. Almost everything in the Bible needs to be interpreted arbitrarily according to your brand of faith and that is why we have so many faith!<br>  <br>  In that first Creation week of 7x24 = 168 hours... the Bible God also created all the angels in Heaven and as soon as he did that ONE THIRD of them were not one bit impressed by God’s glory and beauty and rebelled against him on the spot! God did not destroy them, but he created a HELL AS AN AFTERTHOUGHT to burn them for ever and ever NOT NOW, but later on at the end of the world! (Rev 12:4,9) God is in desperate need of “demonic” powers to hurt the people that he loves so much and to send them to the Hell that “God prepared for Satan and his angels!” Low IQ humans always blame somebody else for all their pain and suffering. The poor Devil is such a handy scapegoat! The preachers hide these Bible stories from everybody saying that the atheists are twisting the “Word of God” showing only what is bad in it, but not the “GOOD NEWS” that God the Father sent God the Son Jesus Christ down to Earth to be beaten to a pulp thoroughly tenderized and heavily marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit to be presented “as a spotless Lamb of God” ready to be grotesquely nailed totally naked to a Holy Cross! There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed their victim’s genital area in a diaper before hanging them on any cross! Only a wanking pervert would write anything like that in any book! Christians MUST regularly eat Jesus’ spit flavored Meat and drink his Holy Blood in the Sacrament of the Holy Communion to be worthy of him and to go to Heaven when they die. In Heaven God will tell them all about the dinosaurs, and unicorns, dragons, and so on! It takes very few arguments to please a gullible… oops sorry, faithful Christian! I am amazed at the scientific community’s ignorance of Bible gross “creationist” dogmas to even honor engaging in any argument with Christianity! Christians don’t want “the Devil” to confuse them with any scientific fact. They prefer to stick to the “faith” that was “delivered once for all!”<br>  <br>  1 Timothy 6:20 (Infallible King James Version) O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, AVOIDING PROFANE AND VAIN BABBLINGS, AND OPPOSITIONS OF SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED. <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 3:19-20 (Infallible King James Version) For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.

Do ALL "atheists" make these kinds of "judgments"?  And you misconstrue several DIFFERENT meanings of the word "judge."  There are many kinds of judgment.  What many "atheists" possibly object to is your "moral" judgments.  Judgments concerning morality, and also judgments based on false information and false premise.  The very kind of fallacous argument you're making here, with no logic, and broad based erroneous statements concerning things your bias distorts far from reality, they find onerous.  But this is NOT a moral judgment.  People make and must necessarily make all manner of judgments.  But it is those moral judgments based on irrational arguments, unprovable premise, and contradictory facts which most upsets them.<br>  <br>  You state;  "They say they need proof to believe in God;"<br>  <br>  This is your incorrect conception.  And you are absolutely incorrect.  By the very nature of your concept of "god" it is NOT open to proof.  So therefore they do NOT make this evaluation.  It would not be logical.  BUT they want your concept of "God" to be based on reality.  They do not care if you believe in "God' but do not use this "belief" to MORALLY judge others.  Do not use this concept of "God" to bring unnecessary harm to others.  Do not use this concept of "god" to limit the rights of others which you automatically assume for yourself.  <br>  <br>  There are many people who believe things not provable within the material universe,  That is fine,  But all truth MUST be one.  Beliefs MUST not be contradictory.  Your God must not hate and love at the same time.  Do not conceive of a loving God who hates or does not care about select groups of people.  And do not believe that your 'religious" beliefs MUST be infallible.<br>  <br>  You continue:  "Yet there is no proof for the Big Bang,"  Here you are confusing scientific theory with religious belief.  We DO have enough scientific facts right now to determine that the universe is EXPANDING without any possibility of reversing entropy.  Thus scientists use all the currently known facts as they are now understood, and theorize that the universe had to have a beginning.  All information points to this.  This is the Big Bang theory.  You should be delighted.  It means that the universe had a beginning!  <br>  <br>  But do NOT confuse religious belief with science.  Science can theorize about the material universe, but about God they have NOTHING to say.  At least NOT as a scientific theory.  This is NOT within the realm of science.<br>  <br>  So now what is so "wrong' about the Big Bang Theory?  What do you not "like" about it?<br>  <br>  You continue:  "but they choose to put their FAITH in the magic of a self created Big Bang."<br>  <br>  A totally preposterous statement and totaly without reason.  You again seem to insist on using DIFFERENT meanings of the concepts of "faith", along with the concepts of magic, and use the word "self-created" where science would never put it.  Again I reiterate.  Science CAN NOT make any statement concerning "self-creation"  This is a "religious" concept and must be either believed or disbelieved without possibility of proof within the material universe.  Thus it is NOT science.  It is also untrue.  Just because science proposes a Theory called the "Big Bang" does not imply anything other than the known material facts.  IF this universe was created by a "God" or anything else, that is purely philosophical speculation and not within the perview of science.<br>  <br>  When you use the word "faith" here your are incorrectly juxtoposing a "religious" concept of believing something without the possibility of proof within the material universe, with the scientific concept of using a 'Theory' to try to describe known physical events.  This "faith: scientist use IS NOT the faith of religion, but a critical evaluation of known facts, and limited in its sciope to ONLY the material universe.  I have "faith" that the earth will not leave the orbit of the sun, but NOT because of any religious belief, but because I understand the law of gravity and have "faith" that it will not change before tomorrow.  I have never been to Japan but have faith in the word and experience of others to believe it really exist.  This kind of faith is NOT a religious faith but just a critical eveluation of known facts of the material universe.<br>  <br>  Magic AND self createdness has NOTHING to do with the theory of the Big Bang.  So please stop pretending that scientists believe this.<br>  <br>  You stated;  "They say the Bible is man made,"<br>  <br>  This is entirely obvious. EVERY written thing is written by men.<br>  <br>  You conclude: "so it is unreliable;"<br>  <br>  This is NOT a correct assessment of this conclusion. Of course anything done by men has some element of un reliability. This should be completely obvious. peo[ple are errant. People make mistakes. But this conclusion can be made merely by actually READING the Bible. It contains hundreds of internal contradictions both as to opposing content and information refuted by other sources of knowledge. It espouses dogmatic theories which are also self-contradictory. Thus the judgment that the Bible is unreliable is based on empirical evidence open for all to view. (Just one of the MANY self contradictory postulations contained within the Bible is this. Take ALL verses which speak of Easter Sunday. Put them into a non-contradictory chronological order. You will find that this can not be done, And this is just one aspect of its internal unrelaibility. it also has to do with HOW one interrets it. A literal interpretsation is a total absurdity. It is easily refited by many scientific observations, and also some historical ones. IF you interpret it to ONLY be the repository of religious truth then go right ahead. Just make sure that your own theology is consistent and non-contradictory.<br>  <br>  You continue: "Yet every theory they quote is man made,"<br>  <br>  Again you confuse religious truth not subject to proof within the material universe, and scientific method and observation whih IS TESTABLE. Many theories have indeed been proven WRONG. Science however has nmade many advancements and the standard of living you now enjoy and the state of medicine etc, is because the scientific method eventually works. Science does NOT claim that everythig it ststes is true. It is only an attempt to explain known observable facts. But just because some element of a theory prooves untrue, does not invalidate the entire theory. You again are confusing the kinds of "belief" and misconstrue the method of science with the method of the philosopher.<br>  <br>  You continue: "and they not only want you to believe its reliable, but they try their best to present their theories as facts." YOU ARE ENTIRELY WRONG. The facts speak for themselves. It is a combination of facts which provide the foundations for theory. Enough facts are known and some theories have been proven so reliable that MOST of what is theorized is surmised to be true. Thus we are quite comfortable in the "belief" that the earth is over 4.5 million years old. This age is obtained by so many methods that they can no longer be open to doubt. The theory of eviolution is definitely NOT complete. However almost half of all human knowledge has proven that its basic concept is totally reliable. All the modern technology you use today is because science as a method for discerning truth of our material universe is an eminently good method. Are all scientists infalible? Of course not. But just because some aspect of a theory is eventually proven to be untrue in no way invalidates the entire theory. <br>  <br>  But you insist on confusing disparate methods of acquiring truth. Science is NOT religion, and the efforts to learn truth by each method are almost opposite in method. Science says that one muyst be ready to doubt what one assumes to be true IF new informatiuon necessitates a new amendment to theory. Whereas religion says that one MUST NOT DOUBT.<br>  <br>  They get offended if you share your beliefs;"<br>  <br>  NO they only get offended if you speak about science through ignorance. Only if you try to compare scientific truth of the material universe and state that YOUR religious belief deserves the same regard. <br>  <br>  "Yet they love to preach why they don't believe in God,"<br>  <br>  So what? Note that NOW this is NOT science but ALSO a belief NOT provable within the material universe. <br>  <br>  "and why believers shouldn't believe." Well again so what. You kleep telling NON-believers why they SHOULD believe. And I do NOY want you to stop. Belief in something beyond the realm of the material universe HAS A LEGITIMATE PLACE IN THE HUMAN MIND. <br>  <br>  I believe without proof that to do good and avoid evil is a moral imperative, I believe without proof that to love your neighbor as yourself is the height of wisdom. I believe without proof in the transcendence of love in our lives.|`|UnLkBsViaa	I became an atheist by studying religion, not science.

Give us proof and we'll all join you in church next week.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	if you don't know something, it's ok to admit you don't know something.. that would be honest and admirable..... but to be a chalatan and pretend you know the answer by simply inserting the name 'god' in there, would be lying to yourself aka delusional|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	everyone can be a hypocrite at one point in time. everyone judges others and everyone is intolerant of something. to say and act like your not is a lie.|`|Nsh3lVDPaa	Brother I'm a Muslim yet I'll defend any Christian who argues against an atheist because we believe in the same god!<br>  <br>  Amen!<br>  <br>  Atheists are hypocrites too.

If you can't prove me wrong, then I'm not a hypocrite.<br>  <br>  You are the one that gets offended when I share my beliefs, but your sharing is considered proselytizing and everyone hates you for it.<br>  <br>  All religion is fake.  We don't just pick on you.  We don't believe in ANY gods or supernatural beings.  I will tell anyone from any religion how I feel on a religion board.  That's what this place is for.  It's not the Christian Feel Good Party Board.<br>  <br>  For hundreds of years you Christians have had your way and you just absolutely hate it that in this day any age we atheists can speak up and tell it like it really is. <br>  <br>  Sorry...but too bad.  Take your persecution complex elsewhere.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	That's such complete gibberish that I don't even know where to begin.  It's obvious that you know nothing about physics or astronomy or the big bang theory (originally postulated by a Catholic priest, BTW) or even the scientific method.  You make broad brush generalizations while making absolutely no effort to substantiate them.  In fact, you did everything yourself, in your question, that you accuse atheists of doing and you have the audacity to call THEM hypocrites.  Unbelievable.<br>  <br>  And your line "I ASKED, are many atheists hypocrites. I never said they ARE.", coming after everything else you wrote, is complete bull ****.  I can't believe you had the balls to add it.|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	You could flip all those statements around and it would turn into: religious people are hypocrites. <br>  <br>  Every single person on the earth who has the capability to think and talk is a hypocrite in some form.<br>  <br>  Especially people who assert that their religion [or lack thereof] is the one true and accept no variations.<br>  <br>  YOU are being a hypocrite by pointing out the flaws of the atheist non-religion.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  <br>  1- *headbrickwall*<br>  <br>  2- Everyone person IS  hypocrite. Are you going to deny it? I was being polite. But then I'm going to say this: ANY ONE WHO HAS ANY OPINION ON ANY RELIGION WHATSOEVER IS A GIGANTIC HYPOCRITE.

HOWEVER this DOES NOT mean they are the smartest human beings on earth as they would have everyone believe. The difference in the atheists you see on the street are impartial to your beliefs and opinions. the ones on R&S spend all day on the computer jacking off to doggy porn and while multitasking by coming on R&S and taking out the fact they are pissed off about their problems on poor unsuspecting Christians such as us. They say we are the cause to their problems, when in reality, the just REFUSE TO UTILIZE THEIR GOD GIVEN ABILITIES AND TALENTS!!!|`|ucuP0boCaa	For an atheist to be a hypocrite he would have to believe in god while saying he did not. I don't think any atheist does that. <br>  A Atheist does not judge you when you say you are a christian. A Atheist knows no god exist and if you say you are a christian you are delusional by definition. The Big Bang is only a theory. You have heard no Atheist say they believe in the Big Bang. What you have heard is Irrationalist talking about the Big Bang in a effort to create a strawman argument. atheist do believe in the scientific method and because the scientific method was being used to theorize the Big Bang it does have credibility. What that means is that they believe in the scientific method not the Big Bang. The bible is man made as opposed to being god breathed. Again  Atheist believe in the scientific method. We get offended when you tell us something stupid and call it your belief. We never insult christianity. We just tell the truth about it. It is a hoax. It is fake. Your god is a joke. No offense intended. Just the facts until you can prove different.|`|5aDMFGykaa	Paragraph 1: I don't judge anyone I just say my opinion this is a constitutional right,<br>  <br>  2: The fact the we don't know until now how the universe was created doesn't mean that god created it...<br>  <br>  3: Scientific theories can be PROVED.

Fun stuff.  Obviously you didn't think this out very well I'm sad to say.  I could spend the next five minutes picking apart your "argument," make every point pointless and explain why; but at this point you have your mind made up.  Even if I did you'd give best answer to whichever Christian response you liked best, which is why it's a flawed system.  All in all, typing a lengthy answer to this would be a waste of time and accomplish nothing.  I doubt that you'll even read this past the first two sentences, then form an opinion on what sort of person I must be because I disagree.  Oh well.|`|AA11115051	Yeah many Atheist are hypocrites but so are many Christians. We're all humans and must forgive each other but most importantly ask for forgiveness from GOD. There are so many things happening in today's world, Satan has told many lies to confuse us and keep us from knowing GOD. He once had the privilege of been in GOD's presence and ever since he came down from heaven like a lighting bolt he has been trying to keep anyone from knowing the true Holy, Good, and Omnipotent GOD he is jealous of. Brother's we musn't fight ourselves the real enemy is under your feet and sometimes at the gates of your doubts waiting to come in and destroy you. Once you know the tru GOD the evil one will try almost anything to make you fall and denounce him. But if you really are with GOD you would know you're more than victorious!|`|WWIs1o5qaa	Atheists always ask us if God created us where did He come from b/c everything has a beginning. Well if everything has a beginning then the small particles that everything came from (supposedly) had a beginning too right. So where did it come from? And where did the answer to that last question begin? etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that we are all hypocrites. Everyone has said something that goes against what they say or believe in. Whether it's fitting in with the "cool" kids or preaching about theft and then breaking into Fort Knox. The point is that whether know it or not you're a hypocrite.|`|c6d95122b528aaf12d8a33c6ae3bb0e3aa	Atheists tell you not to judge others? Doesn't the bible tell you that also, then you judge anybody of a different belief or homosexuals or whomever?<br>  <br>  There is no proof of a Big Bang? There is over a 90% accuracy rating by the thinkers of the world at the moment on the theory compared to that of ANY religion in existence today.<br>  <br>  Every theory other than religious is man-made and thus presented as such? Do you mean how we can date such things as plants as being in existence many millions of years before the idea of Gods creation of the earth, which is only some 4,000 years old? Smart.<br>  <br>  And atheists get offended if you share your beliefs, as opposed to the religious folk who persecute, torture and kill people - even to this day - if they disagree with them? <br>  <br>  I think a regrouping and rethinking of your question would not go amiss here. As the bible says, let him without sin cast the first stone|`|ccf1380d8076cbe37300f50ef722bbf2aa	Atheists tell you not to judge others because your book says not to judge others and you judge based on your book, atheists do not have a book to tell them not to judge others or else be judged.<br>  <br>  Newsflash, I do not believe in the big bang. However, the theory of big bang is still more acceptable by then the hypothesis of god.<br>  <br>  The bible is man made about imaginary supreme creature(s), it is as reliable as the next mythlogical book which works based on "Blessed are those who not see but yet believe". Scientific theories, however, is based on facts and it can be torn apart by others who disagree with it.<br>  <br>  I did not preach why I don't believe in god, I just say why I do not believe in one more mythological creature without evidences.<br>  <br>  "<br>  They love to insult Christianity; But if you point out the flaw of another religion, you're a close-minded Bigot.<br>  "<br>  <br>  What do you mean by this?<br>  <br>  I have a lot of christians friends who are not like the ones here too, what is the difference?

I don't know many hypoctrical Christians either, but I still think religion is bull****. <br>  <br>  If we were to whittle it down, I would really think that there are more hypocritical religious people than hypocritical atheists. Just look at the world around you. From these supposed people of God murdering people all over the Middle East to bigots in America trying to have Creationism taught in schools to the Catholic Church violating the innocence of children, it's in every organised religion. At least atheists don't claim to be living good, moral lives the way "God" wants them to and then doing the exact opposite of what any good person would consider moral.|`|zgs3LGpjaa	Okay proof for the big bang: everything is moving away from a fixed like that of a, you guessed it, big bang. Plenty of more evidence, just don't want to go into details.<br>  You drift away from the big bang to quantum mechanics, thinking that disproves the big bang. Quantum mechanics ties into how the universe was made, not created, from quantum uncertainty and the actual total of energy being 0, due to negative energy. No Miracle had to take place, energy can create matter.<br>  Yes, both the bible and theories are sort of man made. Theories are observations through critical testing and the study of. The bible is a man made attempt, along with millions to discover a meaning.<br>  I never get offended by personal beliefs, they are a personal matter to due with the your personal psychology. I only get angry when people lie, try to force beliefs, or manipulate them to there advantage.<br>  I think by your last sentence, I can defend some atheist by saying: We point out the flaws in your belief and others, you only accept the flaws pointed out in others and don't pay attention to our successful attack on your religion.<br>  Your quotes are a logical fallacy, it's a call to authority.<br>  Your turning into what you hate most, closed minded bigots.

It is something they will never overcome on their own. . they need help and prayers !!!|`|ozwLZwXeaa	It has become my experience that a mean person is self centered  and wants their own way or they get angry. It has little or nothing to do with their childhood as far as I know. People that I have known and others<br>   that I know of, have had a really terrible childhood and turned out to be the sweetest people I have ever known. My one friend was given away when she was two and was raised by a grandmother who could have cared less if she ate or was clean. It just depends on the content of their heart and soul.|`|b3h0ovgRaa	Some people do have a mean streak but I don't think they are born with it and some people who had a bad childhood can be very nice.

They already are mean to there friends and say and do mean things. I wonder if they were born that way or they copy what that see at home.|`|EZKe92TTaa	Yeah, I don't think people are born intrinsically mean.  They could be shy, or outgoing, but being mean has to do with being deprived of being treated with respect, with love, not being shown caring, kindness and gentleness.

There are excuses for being mean and none of them are acceptable. If some one is mean, regardless of the reason, they need for someone bigger and bolder to kick the shid out of them. That often cures meanness. If they don't learn to change their ways then they should be removed from society in order to protect those that abide by acceptable social behavior.|`|8G42oyydaa	Nope but I do believe in the "mean gene".

But none of the brothers (my uncles)had it, that I know of. <br>  <br>  People who have bad childhoods can grow up to be wonderful, successful, compassionate, loving, kind people. People who had "perfect" childhoods can grow up to be real jerks. <br>  <br>  Some things that can make people bitter, if they have a predisposition to be, are poverty, pain, abandonment, illness, loneliness, abuse, greed etc.<br>  <br>  But I believe it is up to the individual how they react, is it genetic?

a9BYPzKxaa	Well, you can't really let people or not let people judge you.  It's out of your hands.  People are gonna judge no matter what, it's human nature.  You should be yourself and do whatever makes you happy.  Don't worry about others, it's never gonna end.  People are gonna judge till the end of time, but you have to work on making sure it doesn't end up being a problem for you.  And as far as your sister goes, ask her what her look is all about.  And if she starts judging you, then just remain calm, take a deep breath and show her confidence.  Show her that you don't care what she or anyone thinks.  Don't worry so much, and keep your head up high and love who you are...stay confident in yourself.  Good luck and take care.|`|8OREBeRdaa	Hey do what you want.

o6MQWMo5aa	It's a term that woman use when they realise they aren't going to get their own way. Saves them explaining sensibly why you should do, or not do, a certain act. Usually accompanied by a drama queen action that receives sympathetic reactions from other females present. Fancy a beer?.|`|g0gMQUCVaa	A typical man works really hard for his family.  Is someone his family can depend on in an emergency.  Is charming, handsome, wise, he uses logic rather than emotion when dealing with problems.

Callous.  <br>  Not thoughtful.  Unromantic.<br>  <br>  Straighten up.  Look her right in the <br>  eye and say, "I know I was wrong <br>  and I want to make it right with you <br>  again, I love you too much to lose <br>  you over a hairbrained dumb thing <br>  like I did."

It depends on the context, but most often (if said in a situation that wasnt really positive) it can be summed up as "Typical man, you (men) just dont get it." <br>  <br>  As in you are disregarding the particular woman you are with, with regards to her thoughts, feelings or opinion. <br>  <br>  To me a typical man is just a human being who isnt as fussy around the house, doesnt notice things that  women notice, and doesnt really care if the dinnerware all goes together. LOL and when he washes floors forgets there are corners to do.<br>  <br>  We are different, and all of us are individuals, no typical about us except for our gender, and a few gender biological facts, such as most men are stronger than women. And women are usually more sensitive and better communicators. <br>  <br>  So?  What'd you do?<br>  <br>  Edit: I was thinking about this and all my friends who are male.  And being a typical man is not necessarily a bad thing, but of course depends on the situation  in which it was used. <br>  <br>  My male friends are "typically" dependable, solid, supportive, not prone to gossip, funny, they just make you feel smile and feel better, and with one exception, positive.  They are  loyal, and really good people.  Not given to b**ch fits or mood swings. <br>  <br>  So all in all not a BAD thing, depending of course on the context.  <br>  <br>  (Excepting of course the old fool who came on to me)|`|AA12038658	I hate to pigeon-hole people into categories and I really don't know you. What precipitated her comment? <br>  <br>  If I wanted to give you a basic definition, men are simple: f**k them, feed them, let them sleep.  Now if you're going to have a long-term relationship, there must be some communication & mutual respect if your relationship is going to survive.|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	I don't relish being a typical anything.

Icwz678Qaa	When the Africans were brought to America to be slaves in order to be okay with this the missionaries taught them of Christianity.<br>  <br>  The Africans were and still are very religious and Christianity gave the slaves a comfort through their horrible ordeal.  <br>  <br>  I'm not surprised that you haven't met a Black Atheist, I'm sure there are some, but not many.<br>  <br>  Be Blessed:-)|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Well, most white people are Christian in America too. And since there are fewer black people than white people, you are less likely to meet a black atheist simply because there are fewer of them because the black population is smaller than the white population.<br>  <br>  I've met a few black atheists, and a lot of black Muslims. They aren't all Christians.|`|AA11440601	Probably good sense.<br>  <br>  The 270 million Catholic Christians of African descent in more than 59 countries represent about 25% of the one billion Roman Catholics throughout the world.<br>  <br>  Most Black Catholics are in Africa.

How many blacks do you know and have asked if they were atheist? I am black. I am a Atheist. My brother in law is a Atheist. One of my best friends is a christians for a completely ridiculous reason<br>  <br>  I think it is completely ridiculous for a black person to believe in the religion that belongs to their former oppressors. I think it's stupid for mexicans or Filipinos to believe in a god other than the god of their country. If I were religious there would be no doubt about my god being for me first.|`|hXQnR2Scaa	I know a few black Atheists.<br>  <br>  As for Christianity, most of Americans that have a religious belief system are Christian of some sort. It should not surprise you that most black people are too.|`|AA10481071	Most aren't Christian,  only some.<br>  <br>  Most will say they are,  but truly they aren't and that goes for white people too.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	I met plenty of black atheists while attending college in NYC.

But trust me, there are black atheists.<br>  <br>  Most whites are Christian.  It would stand to reason that most blacks are Christian.  And since blacks are a minority in this country, you probably simply don't see it as often as you would with whites.|`|xlY5fu6raa	to tell u the truth i think from the slave trade in africa where the europeans took the africans to different places like south america, the west indes and southern part of america....some of the europeans was christians and they shared there faith with the slaves....i may be incorrect but i think its possible of you think of it<br>  nice question thou|`|htVmrSDsaa	Neither have I lol, but i guess because of slaves were always talking about God and how He would deliver them. Soon enough it happened and I think we went to church a lot in the future to reverence all that he has done for us and still today it is passed on..  (I REPORTED YOU  mr.

I talk to them all the time in the world. Maybe its got something to do with the whole struggle that blacks went through and how they clung to their faith to make them through. Since then, alot of blacks may believe but you would swear they lost their minds.<br>  <br>  Kids sagging pants etc. Makes me sick to see it. But this is the world.|`|HIskrREJaa	this might not be right, but alot of their families originated from the south during the slave days and that's a pretty religious demographic area.<br>  and yes i've met plenty of black atheists.|`|JyAUAbsjaa	wow, that's a really good question.

Americans ALONE give more than $300 billion per year to charity. This is above and beyond the billions and billions given by America itself (taxpayer money). Then, factor in the ENTIRE rest of the world...and it hasn't even scratched the surface of the need out there in the world. 2.5% of the income of Muslims (primarily benefactors of charity themselves due to their backward nature as demonstrated in the Middle East and Africa for example) would be even less.<br>  <br>  2. There is plenty of crime in Islam (half of it committed by the Islamic rulers themselves). It is just impossible to record, under-reported (no one wants to be killed for reporting being raped) and usually undetected in the first place (lawlessness is commonplace in predominantly Muslim communities). Of course, I guess that there is always a warm, fuzzy feeling whenever a young shoplifter gets his hand chopped off...<br>  <br>  3. Yes, just like the economies of todays Muslim countries (sarcasm). Seriously, Muslims pay as much or more interest than non-Muslims (they just find creative ways to fool Allah into thinking it is not interest). What happens when a Muslim defaults on a loan? Ahhh...he loses his collateral. I suppose that if you want to go back to having a few rich land-owning lords and a bunch of poor serfs then it's a good idea....<br>  <br>  Seriously, no offense, but an entirely Islamic world would be a terrible place to live.

They are not condemned to grow old and die like civilization’s laws. They are always young and strong. For example, despite all its societies for good works, all its establishments for the teaching of ethics, all its severe discipline and regulations, civilization has been unable to contest the All-Wise Qur’an on two of its matters, and has been defeated by them. These two matters are:<br>  Be steadfast in performing the prayers, and give zakat,<br>  and, <br>  God has permitted trade and forbidden usury.<br>  <br>  Yes, the upper and lower classes in human society, that is, the rich and the poor, live at peace when in equilibrium. The basis of that equilibrium is compassion and kindness in the upper classes, and respect and obedience in the lower classes.Together with all its societies for good works, all its establishments for the teaching of ethics, all its severe discipline and regulations, civilazition could not reconcile these two classes of mankind, nor could it heal the two fearsome wounds in human life.

y9CgveCGaa	I think you can send both if you want to.  All cards are nice and they will help pick up her spirits.  I just helps to know people remember you for any reason.|`|wRpY2FRXaa	I have been faced with similar situation before.  From experience I know that people who are in a grieving process especially a very recent loss of a loved one, has more need to be comforted.  You can express a note of condolence and a birthday greeting in one card by choosing a card that is generally inspirational rather than one that is occasion-specific.  You can write in the card something like  you are sorry to hear of your friend's loss and praying for her.  And in another sentence you could wish her a blessed  birthday (instead of happy birthday).|`|0e0a0f1828f99f87ea3d5e5bc8cbd46daa	A thinking of you card would be best. They don't want to be reminded of their birthday, and they don't want to be reminding of their mother's death, just let her know that you are thinking of her.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I would do both.  Send the sympathy card right away.  Then send a simple birthday card, or even get a blank one and tell her that while you know she's grieving, you're still very glad that she was born and is here.|`|6UlOorwMaa	I would say both. obviously the birthday card would be a subdued one, maybe a blank one would be good, you can write your own note.|`|AA10500537	you can send both im sure she;ll understand|`|8z0UZpkoaa	If it is your custom to send this person a card on her birthday, it would seem appropriate to do it again this time.   A note containing your condolences would not really be 'wrong' to add to your best wishes, surely?   <br>  <br>  Like you, I would worry myself sick about something like this, but, when all is considered, a birthday card is hardly an important document, surely.  [ To send nothing, if you have regularly sent something in the past, would be worse, perhaps.]  <br>  <br>   Birthday cards, like Christmas cards, are merely commerce's way to  extract some money from middle class people who wish each other a 'happy birthday', etc., and are hardly a legal document.   In this woman's situation, I think I would like to receive the card. <br>  <br>   I doubt very much if I would have a single negative thought about it.|`|4POGapREaa	Okay, I say the loss outweighs the birthday.  We all have a birthday once a year that we probably don't fully appreciate anyway & this is not a celebratory time for her.  I was in a fog for months after my husband's mom passed away & the cards we got really helped me.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Sending two cards might be a little awkward. I like the idea of writing a message from your heart, either in a letter or a blank card. You can cover both the sympathy and the birthday, and offer your support if she wants to talk.|`|207dFmdHaa	Just get a blank card, one you can write her a note in, tell her how you are so sorry for her loss and you know that this birthday will be the hardest because it is the first after the death of her mother. If you knew her mom, write a little note about a memory you have about her, or a story you remember your friend telling. Mention her birthday and the loss in your letter....I wouldnt send two cards|`|8VlDuMFOaa	If it were me in your position hun, I would find a really nice blank card, or a "thinking of you" card, adding some nice thought out words for her loss.<br>   Rather than post the card, I would hand deliver it and give her a big bunch of flowers for her birthday at the same time.<br>  This along with having your company and friendship over a coffee might put a smile on her face, and help take her mind off her sadness - even if it is just for a few moments.|`|zNjACkxpaa	I would do both.

dmTVbpcWaa	The witness of God’s spirit convinces anointed Christians that they have heavenly prospects. “You received a spirit of adoption as sons,” wrote Paul, “by which spirit we cry out: ‘Abba, Father!’ The spirit itself bears witness with our spirit that we are God’s children. If, then, we are children, we are also heirs: heirs indeed of God, but joint heirs with Christ, provided we suffer together that we may also be glorified together.” (Romans 8:15-17) Under the holy spirit’s influence, the spirit, or dominant attitude, of anointed ones impels them to apply to themselves what the Scriptures say about Jehovah’s spiritual children. (1?John 3:2) God’s spirit gives them a sense of sonship toward him and engenders within them a unique hope. (Galatians 4:6,?7) Yes, everlasting earthly life as perfect humans surrounded by family members and friends would be splendid, but that is not their God-given hope. By means of his spirit, God has produced within them such a strong heavenly hope that they are willing to sacrifice all earthly attachments and prospects.—2?Corinthians 5:1-5,?8; 2?Peter 1:13,?14.<br>  <br>   Anointed Christians are certain of their heavenly hope, of their having been taken into the new covenant. Jesus mentioned it when he instituted the Memorial and said: “This cup means the new covenant by virtue of my blood, which is to be poured out in your behalf.” (Luke 22:20) The parties to the new covenant are God and anointed ones. (Jeremiah 31:31-34; Hebrews 12:22-24) Jesus is the mediator. Made operative by Christ’s shed blood, the new covenant took out not only from the Jews but also from the nations a people for Jehovah’s name and made them part of Abraham’s “seed.” (Galatians 3:26-29; Acts 15:14) This “everlasting covenant” provides for all spiritual Israelites to be resurrected to immortal life in heaven.—Hebrews 13:20.<br>  <br>   The anointed are sure of their hope. They have been taken into an additional covenant, the Kingdom covenant. Concerning their sharing with Christ, Jesus said: “You are the ones that have stuck with me in my trials; and I make a covenant with you, just as my Father has made a covenant with me, for a kingdom.” (Luke 22:28-30) This covenant between Christ and his associate kings remains forever operative.—Revelation 22:5.|`|q57P8uJbaa	I am not a Jehovah's Witness, but you are actually talking about the 144,00 in Revelations, not 140,000.<br>  <br>  In any event since Taze Russell and Jehovah Witnesses started around 1880, they are at least 100 years old.  Having millions of believers, isn't it possible tht the 144,000 number would have been already fulfilled.  Also according to the Jehovah Witness definition, would not some of the 144,000 also have been members of the early bibical church 2,000 years ago.  In any event the definition of who the 144,000 are has changed a few times during the Jehovah Witness doctrinal history.<br>  <br>  The Bible actually says that the 144,000 are from the twelve tribes of Israel, 12,000 from each tribe.|`|sDsCUEvnaa	My friend took me to their service last year.  When you go there they will tell you what you have to do.  Pass the bread and wine to the person seating next to you.  When it reaches the end the Elder takes it and start in the row behind you and so on it goes until the last person passes it back to the Elder.  The people that partake of it knows inside of them that they should drink and eat.  I do as I am told because I am just a visitor and visitor's should not be rude in another place of worship.  Especially a worship place!|`|o1hyyXw7aa	It's actually 144,000. What's funny is there have been more than that who have claimed to be one of the anointed ones.

UIJorsD7aa	Chabad (aka Lubavitch) is a Hassidic group.

It is a Hebrew acronym for chochmah, binah, da'at which means wisdom, understanding and knowledge.<br>  <br>  The movement was founded in late 18th century by Shneur Zalman and took its name from Lyubavichi, the Russian town which served as the movement's headquarters for over a century. <br>  <br>  Now really fast: All Jews believe in the first coming of the messiah. Hasidim tend to take a more strict Kabbalistic philosophy and approach to Judaism.<br>  <br>  However, this should not be confused with "Messianic Judaism" which is a Christian Evangelical group -- They have nothing to do with Judaism whatsoever and no branch of Judaism accepts them (Their goal is to evangelize Jews.

I just googled (I`ll hold my hands up).<br>  <br>  I see so many assumptions to questions like these that ALL messianic Jews consider Jesus as the messiah when this particular explaination supports a belief in a Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson as being a messiah.<br>  Is this possibly an alternative answer?<br>  <br>  "Chabad messianism, or Lubavitch messianism,[1] is a term used to describe a spectrum of beliefs within the Chabad Hasidic movement regarding their late leader Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson and his purported position as the Messiah.[2] While some believe that he died but will return as the messiah,[3] others believe that he is merely "hidden." Most negate the idea that he is the revealed messiah.

You can find out about Chabad here <a href="http://www.chabad.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chabad.org/</a> but this has precisely nothing to do with so-called "Messianic Judaism".  I know you have understood that "Messianic Jews" aren't Jewish but followers of Jesus who for some reason don't like being called Christians.  Chabad has no connection with that.  <br>  <br>  The ONLY interpretation I could imagine is that Chabad is part of the Lubavitch movement, which honoured the Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, whom some believed was the moshiach (messiah).  A few still cling to this belief.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Any time that you see anyone stating they are a 'messianic jew', you can be 100% sure they belong to the Christian Evangelical Cult, the Messianic Cult.

Like all genuine Jews, they are inherently messianic; Judaism is intrinsically messianic as we await the Jewish maschiach. No Jew EVER EVER EVER refers to themselves as 'messianic' - because it goes without saying.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps (((Marie))). <br>  <br>  It is so frustrating for us when Messianics/Evangelicals go round lying and misrepresenting Judaism, and it causes confusion for our Christian friends which is a great shame.<br>  <br>  Messianic = Christian Evangelical<br>  <br>  If you'd like to read more, read The Missionary Position at <a href="http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://ajewwithaview.blogspot.com</a>|`|Rl1Qqcqzaa	No such group exists.

But the "how" is something to take into consideration, though. <br>  <br>  Without introspection? Does that mean you just blurt out whatever you're thinking? Even when assuming you only have good intentions, it may get you in trouble. <br>  <br>  Imagine I am your best friend, you come over to show me a new shirt you bought and apparently are very happy with. The minute I see it, I think: "Holy moses! what an awful shirt.. she looks like an elephant in it!" Now imagine I have only good intentions, and just say what I am thinking. It might put a serious dent in our friendship.. I'd better think for a sec and say something like: "I can see you are pretty happy with it, but I think it's not the right colour/size/pattern for you.." Just saying "Oh, how lovely!" would be a lie. It would be polite, but telling lies is not a good thing. <br>  <br>  And by the way.. introspection also means questioning yourself about why you are thinking / feeling the things you think / feel. It will teach you a lot about yourself, and it will help you to become a better / more mature / wiser person. Forgetting about introspection is sure missing out on growing, mentally, and I would not recommend it.|`|7yi2P0Mmaa	maybe its a good idea if people thought about what they said before they said it..not to offend anyone, but dont care what people think

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

Research all these things FOR YOURSELF!|`|aQVQUgIaaa	First off.. .stop freaking out (this is in a nice way)<br>  Im assuming your refering to the ancient mayan 2012 thing.<br>  This is a time where something huge is suppose to happen to the HUMAN RACE not the EARTH. The most common (and most relevant & widely accepted theory) is that this is suppose to be a complete change in the way humans interact and think and live as a species.<br>  Very few supported "doomsday" theories are realistic.<br>  <br>  do more research next time you freak.|`|XMIpSxfmaa	fear not don't live in fear live happy. do all you can because u may not make it that long ,or you may be 1 of a hand full that survive it all. be ready everyday and live it like you own it|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	It's no accident that you were born in this specific time of history! You were meant to be here. Perhaps you're meant to see the world as it ends. How do you know if this is true? Well, asking about 2012 is the first sign! Even if it IS true, there's nothing you can do about it. I'm not trying to scare you. Do you even know why some people think the world will end?<br>  <br>  Let me start from the beginning...<br>  The Mayans were an ancient civilization, and very advanced. They knew the world was round, the true length of the year, etc. Their specialty was astronomy. They were able to plot a calender up to thousands of years. Heck, they could even have kept going if they wanted to. Yet, they ended it on December 21th, 2012...<br>  Like most civilizations, the Mayans had their own religion and their own Gods. They believed that three worlds were created before ours. Each was destroyed because it's humans were defective. We've only lasted so long because are the true people, made out of maize, a sacred corn to the Mayan. They say the end of this world is (you guessed it) December 21th, 2012!<br>  Along with this, there's several other things happening in 2012. First off, the planets are going to put on a little show for us! A few planets are going to line up. Alas, this occurs at noon, so I don't know if we'll see it. There's also a possible reversal of Earth's magnetic field. Research for some more if you'd like.<br>  Now I'll inform you 'bout some past parallel prophecies. A notable one is Nostradamus, the most famous end-time prophet. He saw visions or premonitions, and tried his best to put them into words. True, they're not specifically linked to 2012. Apparently, a comet will come, coinciding with earthquakes and other natural disasters. Also mentioned is a conjunction of the planets. Some interpret the words to describe a polar shift. *hint hint, nudge nudge* Anyways, the Earth changes bring famine, drought, and social upheaval. Civilization will be changed. Continents will split apart with waterways. Powerful nations will be weakened. The soical upheave will allow an antichrist to come to power.<br>  The Book of Revelation in the Bible is one of the best-known texts on end times. It talks about seven seals/scrolls opening, each with an event happening. Then, four angels appear and release winds of destruction. They're told to hold back the winds until Christ puts a seal on the foreheads of 144,000 worthy servants of God who will not be touched by the destruction. This also tells of an antichrist who will achieve world domination. The antichrist will rule until the battle of the Armaggeddon. At this point, Jesus returns to Earth, the 144,000 are sent to heaven, and Christ destorys the armies of the antichrist, who is thrown into a lake of fire. As this happens to Earth, a war is in heaven as well. Angels fight Satan, who is also thrown into the lake of fire.<br>  Edgar Cayce has been told as one of the greatest prophets of all time. He said that the end time would come within the next generation of his period, meaning around 1958 and 1998. Of course, it didn't happen. His basic prophecy fits, but the only relation to time ending in 2012 is the possible polar shift. Here's some hightlights of his end-time prophecy: The Atlantis and Pacific coats of America will be altered. New York city, San Fransico, and Los Angeles will disappear. Russia will become the spiritual hope of the world. Intense Earthquakes will destory California and the Baja peninsula will diappear. The Pacific ocrean will near Arizona and Nebraska. Mount Etna will erupt, signaling the sign of real changes. The Great Lakes will drain into the Gulf thorugh the Mississippi. Japan will go under sea. There will be a pole shift and ice caps will melt, meaning flooding. And new lands will rise out of the ocean, along with lost lands such as Atlantis.<br>  Now let's go to the Skeptic's Corner! There are several problems with 2012 predictions. Many do not come with dates and are vague. If a prediction does come with a date, it turns out to be wrong. What's the purpose of a prediction? Like Nostadamus. Many of his predictions are realized to be true until after it's happened. Useful, huh? The theory of the pole shift is an application of bad science. Have you heard of self-fullining prophecies? A child spills milk on himself, and thinks of himself as accident-prone. Then, several more accidents happen since he damaged his self-confidence. The prophecy is fulfilled. Remember this with 2012.<br>  I hope I've explained this all well enough.

Because you are definitely a beautiful human being.

fXfMYzGbaa	There is no such thing as divorce in the Catholic Church, there is only a possibility of an annulment and to receive an annulment a couple must prove that the marriage that was invalid from the beginning.<br>  <br>  If some one that cheats, or is a substance abuses, or even abusive, then one most likely has grounds for an annulment.<br>  <br>  However, the idea of a no fault divorce or some such thing does not exist in the Catholic Church.  There are people who are "Catholic" and get a civil divorce without getting a Church annulment.  <br>  <br>  Until one obtains an annulment and individual who has received a divorce is not in a state of Grace and cannot receive Christ in the Eucharist.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>I know a lot of people that are divorced Catholics<<<br>  <br>  Divorced according to whom? The state? What do civil divorces have to do with religion? The Catholic Church doesn't recognize civil divorces.|`|AA10192697	The Catholic Church doesn't see divorce at all. If a couple wants to no longer be married, they can file for an annulment but those take time and are rare because the Church tries to counsel the couple in order to help them save their marriage and the annulment is only done if the couple or one of the spouses can prove that their vows were said in vain at the time of their wedding.  <br>  <br>  Most Catholics that are divorced are divorced in the eye of the state, not in the eye of the Church. God stated that once married, always married unless when the vows were said, one or both were lying. That means they were lying in front of God, the priest and the witnesses.  It doesn't mean that they broke a vow later. It means they lied about at least one vow while they said it.<br>  <br>  <br>  If divorces by the state, they are still married in the Church. And if they remarry someone else, they can only marry by the state and not the Church. Making them a bigamist.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	Many Catholics (like my ex) only get divorced so they can remarry. The divorce is offered through the state and the subsequent marriage is either secular or in a non-Catholic church.

Christ taught this and so does the Church. Pax Christi|`|OZVg6Un5aa	Catholic religion is basically the same as Christian, only more relaxed i guess.<br>  While i bet divorce is frowned upon in almost every religion, I don't think God will never forgive you for wanting to trully be happy.<br>  I personally think anyone who bases their "commitment to love" with the wrong person should be with whom they are happy with and love.<br>  I believe thats what God wants.<br>  <br>  <br>  But the whole "all divorcees are Catholic" idea is ignorant.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	No. The Catholic Church believes that marriage is a life-long union, uncapable of being broken. <br>  <br>  Civil divorces are just that: CIVIL divorces. There is no such thing as Catholic divorces.

Xt9wIj4Iaa	No.<br>  <br>  Paul's arrest and death had been prophesied to him. He knew he would die before the end came. (Acts 21:10-14)<br>  <br>  Did Paul think it would come within his generation? No.<br>  <br>  Paul wrote about the Last Days as a future event. (2 Timothy 3:1; 2 Thessolonians 2:1-3)|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Most of the disciples of Jesus thought so.  That is why the disciples did not feel the need to write about the gospels until almost all of the contemporaries of Jesus have died.  But this was a good thing because by then, the tradition and beliefs is completely entrenched in the minds of the members of the community to make the writings error-free.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The point is moot.<br>  <br>  Nobody knew.

But the new earth happens after the rapture, tribulation & thousand year reign are over. Revelations says the earth vanishes & is replaced AFTER the short battle after the 1,000 yr. reign (Rev. Chapters 20 & 21). Even when Christ reappeared after the resurrection He referred to a world w/o end. & this was before Paul's conversion. If I remember church history right Paul was beheaded before John wrote Revelation so he wouldn't have any reason to believe the world would end. Plus the Lord revealed to him his death (time & place) so I'm sure later on he didn't believe the world would end in his lifetime even if he had at first.|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	In the reading of all that Paul had to say, he spoke of a world coming to and end in his time. The text clearly demonstrates his anticipation but he also opened the debate with admonitions that first the man of sin must be revealed and the falling away of the church in a time to come. I leave you with that to ponder. BTW The Messiah also said something very interesting: Some of you here will not taste death until I return. Fascinating isn't it?|`|AA11227341	yes,  so did John; remember when John went preaching the message of salvation and he would say repent for the Kingdom of God is soon upon us?  so yes.|`|49b9f11e44e18077f6f0e62710cda0d0aa	Lifetime can be interpreted in a numerous amount of ways|`|06181585cb328a7544d57e31015f42ecaa	He never specifically said that.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	man who is paul, i really need to start reading the bible again.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Yes, he did teach the immanency of Christ.

That usually gets the job done.|`|PSzzjf4naa	Tell her to get her temper under control . If she doesnt - move on . Life is too short to be emotionally pushed around -|`|cHUadRYeaa	First of all don't write a letter. Most people I know write letters when they wanna say something and they get pretty worked up and then regret what they said in that letter. Words can get pretty hurtful sometimes. What you need to do is get her alone, take her to your house or on a date or something.  Then just tell her to hear you out on somethings you have to say.  If she has something to say about a specific thing let her say it, its better to hear her out at the same time. If she loves you, she'll listen and try to work things out which I'm sure she wants to do. :)
VxozKUcCaa	You never know for sure because different spirits relate to different forms of stimuli.  Poltergeists are brief by nature, haunting spirits (i.e. haunting remnants) do not even have to be human by definition, tweens haunt individuals and not locations, etc.  The point is you never know for sure because just because a place just because a place had spiritual activity at one time does not mean that those same spirits are still there anymore.|`|1U8bg8zvaa	If you hear strange noises or see ghosts, then it's probably haunted! You might want to fight the evil spirits!
7J9Eb3VCaa	Well that's not always a bad thing. I guess being ultra prude could be bad. People start thinking you think you are better than them and such. I'm pretty conservative to peoples face and I can get a little fun. Doing so leaves mystery to you. Guys don't want to know everything about you right away. That's too boring. Maybe just do little sneak peaks of being a little wild don't go all out or else you may seem like a slut and just too easy which is no fun. I'm sure you've heard the saying guys only want what they can't have. It's totally true and you can be that. For example if you dress conservative all the time on a special occasion wear a shirt with a little cleavage not too much, or maybe a cute kind of sexy skirt. Remember don't come off too easy and showing everything you have they will lose interest really fast. If you don't want to show cleavage or wear a little skirt maybe just wear a tighter shirt than normal and some tight jeans that show off your butt. You have to flaunt what you've got. Like I said being a little prude or conservative is a good attribute. It's like two extremes being a prude and being a slut just find somewhere in the middle. Whoever calls you a prude if they are guys are usually not guys you want to be around they just want some action. If they are girls they may be jealous that they are known as sluts and want to seem innocent again. I'm not sure if this helped but good luck I'm sure you will be fine.|`|vZToCRVuaa	y do they consider u prude in the first place?|`|d5g4dt2uaa	Do you  want or need to change? If so, go for it. Otherwise, be yourself. Ask those who think you're a prude what you need to do...there might be a common theme running through what they have to say.

AA11232725	The Holy Ghost or Holy Spirit or "Ruah Hakodesh" in the Hebrew is the eternal Spirit of God. He is first mentioned in this passage.<br>  <br>  Genesis 1:2  The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.<br>  <br>  Being God He never died nor ever will.<br>  <br>  Acts 5:3  But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself?  4  While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."<br>  <br>  Revelation 22:13  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last."  14  Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates into the city.  15  But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie.  16  "I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star."  17  And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely.|`|ZOifSvNhaa	In short gods active force, not a person but a tool of sorts<br>  <br>  ACCORDING to the Trinity doctrine, the holy spirit is the third person of a Godhead, equal to the Father and to the Son. As the book Our Orthodox Christian Faith says: "The Holy Spirit is totally God."<br>  <br>  In the Hebrew Scriptures, the word most frequently used for "spirit" is ru'ach, meaning "breath; wind; spirit." In the Greek Scriptures, the word is pneu'ma, having a similar meaning. Do these words indicate that the holy spirit is part of a Trinity?<br>  <br>  An Active Force<br>  <br>  THE Bible's use of "holy spirit" indicates that it is a controlled force that Jehovah God uses to accomplish a variety of his purposes. To a certain extent, it can be likened to electricity, a force that can be adapted to perform a great variety of operations.<br>  <br>  At Genesis 1:2 the Bible states that "God's active force ["spirit" (Hebrew, ru'ach)] was moving to and fro over the surface of the waters." Here, God's spirit was his active force working to shape the earth.<br>  <br>  God uses his spirit to enlighten those who serve him. David prayed: "Teach me to do your will, for you are my God. Your spirit [ru'ach] is good; may it lead me in the land of uprightness." (Psalm 143:10) When 70 capable men were appointed to help Moses, God said to him: "I shall have to take away some of the spirit [ru'ach] that is upon you and place it upon them."—Numbers 11:17.<br>  <br>  Bible prophecy was recorded when men of God were "borne along by holy spirit [Greek, from pneu'ma]." (2 Peter 1:20, 21) In this way the Bible was "inspired of God," the Greek word for which is The·o'pneu·stos, meaning "God-breathed." (2 Timothy 3:16) And holy spirit guided certain people to see visions or to have prophetic dreams.—2 Samuel 23:2; Joel 2:28, 29; Luke 1:67; Acts 1:16; 2:32, 33.<br>  <br>  The holy spirit impelled Jesus to go into the wilderness after his baptism. (Mark 1:12) The spirit was like a fire within God's servants, causing them to be energized by that force. And it enabled them to speak out boldly and courageously.—Micah 3:8; Acts 7:55-60; 18:25; Romans 12:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:19.<br>  <br>  By his spirit, God carries out his judgments on men and nations. (Isaiah 30:27, 28; 59:18, 19) And God's spirit can reach everywhere, acting for people or against them.—Psalm 139:7-12.<br>  <br>  'Power Beyond Normal'<br>  <br>  GOD'S spirit can also supply "power beyond what is normal" to those who serve him. (2 Corinthians 4:7) This enables them to endure trials of faith or to do things they could not otherwise do.<br>  <br>  For example, regarding Samson, Judges 14:6 relates: "The spirit of Yahweh seized on him, and though he had no weapon in his hand he tore the lion in pieces." (JB) Did a divine person actually enter or seize Samson, manipulating his body to do what he did? No, it was really "the power of the LORD [that] made Samson strong."—TEV.<br>  <br>  "On the whole, the New Testament, like the Old, speaks of the spirit as a divine energy or power." —A Catholic Dictionary<br>  <br>  The Bible says that when Jesus was baptized, holy spirit came down upon him appearing like a dove, not like a human form. (Mark 1:10) This active force of God enabled Jesus to heal the sick and raise the dead. As Luke 5:17 says: "The Power of the Lord [God] was behind his [Jesus'] works of healing."—JB.<br>  <br>  God's spirit also empowered the disciples of Jesus to do miraculous things. Acts 2:1-4 relates that the disciples were assembled together at Pentecost when "suddenly there occurred from heaven a noise just like that of a rushing stiff breeze, . . . and they all became filled with holy spirit and started to speak with different tongues, just as the spirit was granting them to make utterance."<br>  <br>  So the holy spirit gave Jesus and other servants of God the power to do what humans ordinarily could not do.<br>  <br>  Not a Person<br>  <br>  ARE there not, however, Bible verses that speak of the holy spirit in personal terms? Yes, but note what Catholic theologian Edmund Fortman says about this in The Triune God: "Although this spirit is often described in personal terms, it seems quite clear that the sacred writers [of the Hebrew Scriptures] never conceived or presented this spirit as a distinct person."<br>  <br>  Dove<br>  Holy spirit as tongues of fire<br>  On one occasion the holy spirit appeared as a dove. On another occasion it appeared as tongues of fire—never as a person<br>  <br>  In the Scriptures it is not unusual for something to be personified. Wisdom is said to have children. (Luke 7:35) Sin and death are called kings. (Romans 5:14, 21) At Genesis 4:7 The New English Bible (NE) says: "Sin is a demon crouching at the door," personifying sin as a wicked spirit crouching at Cain's door. But, of course, sin is not a spirit person; nor does personifying the holy spirit make it a spirit person.<br>  <br>  Similarly, at 1 John 5:6-8 (NE) not only the spirit but also "the water, and the blood" are said to be "witnesses." But water and blood are obviously not persons, and neither is the holy spirit a person.<br>  <br>  In harmony with this|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Holy Spirit is the connection between God and man that is eternal and can never die.<br>  <br>  ...like the light by which we can know God. When Christ said to "Worship in Spirit," he was saying that we need to increase this inner light to give the direct experience of God.<br>  <br>  Click on my avatar if you want more context on this answer.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	The Holy Ghost(AKA the Holy Spirit)Is Almighty God.|`|9r2TxIYwaa	the holy ghost is the holy spirit. he was never a person, just an essence of God|`|4HUZJdVNaa	He is the invisible God of christians you cannot see him

Do you want him to be with you as a BF? Or be close friends and see where it will take you? I can tell you are confused you don’t now whether to care or not, to love or not? I know how you feel I’m that way myself ;-). To love him is by getting to know him. If you really have strong loving feelings for him then talk to him just know what to say. You can’t be shy you must believe in your self.  I do believe guys can change but the percentage is low. Just be prepare don’t think negative but positive be cool and talk to him like a friend.

Okay, well, first of all, don't listen to what the others say, find out the truth firsthand. Second, communication is the key: so talk to him, ask him questions. Because if you don't ask, you won't know and it will end up eating you from the inside out. Third, if you really like this guy, then tell him, you know, let him know that you like him, so that he understands just a little more why you are always smiling at him, otherwise, he might think that you are weird or something. Now, I know that going up to a guy isn't easy but I beleive that you have the gut to do it. So grab all your confidence and take things slowly. And if you really think this guy is really worth it, then get to know him. The big step is always the worst but once you'ce made it, you'll succeed.|`|ce9pMwKMaa	move on

Clients/customers/business associates are going to come in all races, religions, cultures, etc. If you have an employee who hates someone because of race then you are opening yourself up to all kinds of trouble. Maybe your salesperson wont sell to a black customer or an asian customer.

eO2rnf7yaa	Apparently, according to one answer,  Gerhard Engel is a reliable news source.  <br>  <br>  The NAZI's were pagans.  That is a fact.  They were also barbarians.  Even if Hitler did claim to be a Catholic,  which I doubt, that  does not surprise me one bit.   He was an evil lying murdering barbarian.  Why wouldn't he lie about his religion?<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  An honest assessment of Hitler or Dahmer would show that neither was a Christian.   In the case of Hitler,  Catholics were hated by the NAZI's, and were killed in very large numbers.  Poland was, at the time of Hitler's invasion, well over 90% Roman Catholic.   While it is well-known that Polish Jews were specifically targeted for genocide, it is also true that when a Pole was killed by a NAZI,  the person killed was frequently a Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  Interesting question.<br>  I hope people come to The Truth.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	The link will show you pictures of Hitler and a few Catholic church leaders, as well as him leaving a church.

The work that Christ started but could not finish, I -- Adolf Hitler -- will conclude."<br>  <br>  In a Reichstag speech in 1938, Hitler again echoed the religious origins of his crusade. "I believe today that I am acting in the sense of the Almighty Creator. By warding off the Jews, I am fighting for the Lord's work."<br>  <br>  Hitler regarded himself as a Catholic until he died. "I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so," he told Gerhard Engel, one of his generals, in 1941.

And of course some atheists are rude to me all of the time, but I can't stop them. That is their right to hate if they want to. I choose to love. That's what Jesus tells us to do, and He loves atheists as much as He loves Christians. I also like science, it actually backs up the fact that there is a God. <br>  With that said, I sure would not want to be in the atheists shoes at the White Thrown Judgment.<br>  (By the way, I think you know that science cannot prove that hell doesn't exist)<br>  God bless you, that was a great question!|`|19JkC34Xaa	For the 7000 time, no. I'm not afraid that I'm wrong. Because I know that if I am, I'd honestly (HONESTLY) rather be in hell than in Heaven with a insecure, power-tripping, homophobic, sadistic God and his band of crazies, thankyouverymuch.|`|hbCs2X7Eaa	There's no part of me that says there's hell and science has nothing to do with it. The whole notion of God, heaven and hell is so ridiculous that I can't even fathom believing in it. I might as well believe in Santa Claus.|`|rh8szekzaa	I am not worried about Hell at all. <br>  <br>  And why are you just asking Christians if they're offended by people pushing science on them that could be false? What about all the Christians who push religion on atheists when the chance that religion is false is substantially higher?|`|sA7DuUUBaa	ok well you ask Christan's why do they etc well then I say why do you air worshipers try to push your occult on others by selling them faith. if they reject the sale yous call them atheist...<br>            <br>                   GOD Loves us all..$$$|`|AA10566295	If there is a hell, and a good person who never hurts anyone goes there simply because he can not believe in a God, then God is cruel and sadistic and I would not want to be with Him anyway.....|`|8fPnks0Caa	i dont allow that im a christian and i go up to athiest and try to prove to them that god is real and heaven is real and the bible is not just stories|`|36c219280f881fd9a869475fe716cf47aa	I want to know why some (not all) christians are rude and push fairy tales that are false onto me?<br>  <br>  I was the victim of proselytism just this past weekend!|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Sweetie, you've been a member since last November and still push that Pascal's Wager absurdity.

If there is a 'just' god he will be wise enough to understand he gave me no reason to believe in him.  And if he isn't just, we are all screwed.|`|5aDMFGykaa	If I continue to live the life that I'm living I have no doubt that even if I'm wrong and god still exists then I definitely won't go to hell... Christians think that they are sinfull not us.<br>  <br>  Atheist.|`|uGEwKRilaa	No, I'm not afraid I am going to hell.<br>  <br>  I 110 percent believe there is NO hell, thus the reason I am an atheist.|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	I can forgive. And besides atheists never listen to me. They call my answers "weird rationalizations".|`|LFC1AcmGaa	no, because the bible never even taught hell.|`|NGpztOIMaa	What do you mean "allow"? What would be your idea of allowing this? I firmly believe in God, nothing will ever change that. No atheist could ever change my mind.|`|fLdv5pXLaa	no part of me believes that someone who didn't get baptized will suffer hell|`|bfWcfCKXaa	Talk about loaded questions!|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	because you cant change their mind you can just lectured them. you have to learn how to love your enemys|`|TuTWsVPPaa	To Erika D: Are you dumb?|`|QvlL83AJaa	I'm an atheist and no.|`|924d3783b5ac5e06329d0bedc1d478e4aa	oh, let them be rude, devil made 'em do it.|`|eFo68kuyaa	im a christian and if they want to believe that then thats there choice. yeah i try to convence them that they should be christians and love god the way i do because even if it turned out that chritianity wasnt true which i totally believe it is but dont they want to be sure of the after life and be christians just to have some security of a good life and after life.|`|WlaD0r9faa	are you a muslim.|`|gQspSvLwaa	Yes i'm athiest, and yes i'm afraid of death. but, i'm not 100% athiest...i think god wants me back...its annoying... :p|`|9BeUbORtaa	Some scientific claims "could be false," but they can only be disproved by science. Science is a self-contained and internally coherent discourse; it answers its own questions with its own logic. It doesn't have much to say about religion. The opposite is also true.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	I'm christian, and I only care for what I strongly and willingly believe in, which is " christianity" , so I don't bother about what the atheist say. my faith is much stronger than their claims.|`|bRAmXcowaa	no, im not at all worried about something that I consider to be non existant. <br>  As far as your first statement goes, dont you realise that often it is the christians that go throwing their opinion around, not atheists.<br>  <br>  Why are christians unable to debate a topic without brining god into it (ie "god doesnt agree with that" "thats a sin" "god says so")|`|8j7FCEOraa	Oh god, im sure no one really likes or allows someone to force their beliefs on them<br>  <br>  and secondly, why would an atheist be afraid of going to hell? Their ATHEISTs! Clearly they dont even believe in a hell. <br>  <br>  Thirdly, the world would be a better place if people stopped pinning religions against each other! All this bickering is useless.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	I am not afraid of hell.  Is there any part of you that is afraid that you are devoting your life to something that may be totally wrong?  People in ALL religions feel just as 'right' as you are but a lot of you MUST be wrong you know...|`|oil8ALh4aa	Sometimes I do fear that there could be a Hell<br>  I won't lie.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	No, the idea of "hell" is incoherent nonsense. <br>  <br>  1) Any drooling idiot - especially with the eternity he has supposedly had - could have figured out that being nice to the people in Hell would falsify God's omniscience and undo "creation". Satan would have to be the single most unintelligent being concievable.<br>  2) The image of Hell is not even consistent among Christians. Is it the grave (Jehova's Witnesses), separation from God (which contradicts omnipresence), the soul burning (which begs the question of how the soul is flammable), being physically cast into a lake of fire (almost nobody thinks this), etc.<br>  3) The idea that an all-loving being would impose infinite torment for finite sin, which is all a human would be capable of, is a feudalistic idea no modern person who is not brainswashed would take seriously,|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	Belief cannot be attained by an effort of will.  I find the whole Bible story, including the NT, to be totally unbelievable and mostly without redeeming value except as literature.  My studies have led me to believe that the bible is almost certainly fiction, and that none of the major events recorded in it ever happened.  I cannot believe.  So if there is a hell, I'm doomed to go there.  Seems really, really unlikely though.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	There's no proof there's hell, so no. When you die, your heart stops beating. When your heart stops beating, blood is not circulated throughout your body. When blood does not reach your brain for an extended amount of time (like 10-15 minutes), there's brain damage. Any longer and you become brain dead.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	(1 Peter 3:15) But sanctify the Christ as Lord in YOUR hearts, always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of YOU a reason for the hope in YOU, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect.|`|wnI04x8Kaa	is it not more scary to think there is a god and he is letting a child die of hunger every 3.6 seconds?|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR is 110% absolutly sure tht heaven and hell do not exist.|`|yvDzvIbBaa	im 100% sure that hell is nothing more than a 600 year old human work of fiction.|`|HIskrREJaa	are you trying to fit the christian stereotype by saying we are going to hell?|`|AA12034666	I'm Christian. But it's not up to me to convert them (or anybody else) to my way of thinking. Their views don't have a snow-balls chance in H of changing my views either. I believe in God, and I believe in science. I believe God gave us science and He gave us brains, and He expects us to use both to learn to care for the world that He gave us to live in. I hear people say things all the time that seem false to me. But it's their right to be wrong. As far as I'm concerned, we can agree to disagree. Because in spite of our differences, we do have a lot of similarities -- only one of which is that we are all children of God whether they know it or not.|`|YVeZ8K6haa	Okay, I'm a christian and I really don't let anybody [including atheist] bother me. Its my life and if I want to follow christianity, its my business & nobody else's. To me I hate when they try to argue about whether they think God is real or not. I personally do not attack anyone for their religious beliefs because its childish and immature.|`|G49lKR56aa	Science is facts about the world and universe, that are given by God! Some scientist spend all their lives in search of those facts, not even getting close to the truth! Some get closer by not close enough!<br>  So when a scientist or atheist say some thing like there is no God, science has proved that, what they are really saying is we just haven't found God yet, but we're looking. Too bad their looking in the wrong place! <br>  The more they learn the less brains they use!|`|F32uPjAraa	Erica D, Pope John Paul the second, stated publicly that hell was an allegory, that it did not really exist. So if the leader of the worlds largest cult of the giant vindictive gnome in the sky clan, does not believe in hell, then why should I.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Hell is an idea to control people and force them to follow a believe through intimidation.  Much like slaves listen to their master for fear of the whip.  I am an atheist because I refuse to be a slave.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	i'd rather just pray for them|`|rLc1QeVbaa	i'm atheist, and i assure you i have no fear of going somewhere that doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you must realize....it's only the believers that fear "hell".|`|VgPQM5W2aa	I am an atheist.<br>  No, not at all.

wnSvjwWuaa	A preacher who wasn't "cured" until he got caught. That's new. (sarcastic)<br>  <br>  Obviously, he isn't. He just has to save his face (in more ways than one). I'm sure some prostitutes will be bowing down to the power of the $, especially in the context of the financial mess the USA is in, but I wish all gay men that Haggard propositions for sex will turn him down.<br>  <br>  And saying homosexuality can be "cured" goes against science.

What are these neighbors afraid of? Use this as your basic idea.<br>  <br>  Blood and gore are great and all, but people tend to be more afraid of rotting corpses and missing parts with dried up/almost dry, crusty blood.<br>  <br>  Make sure to go into EXTREME detail for the particularly gruesome parts.<br>  <br>  Make the story appeal to situations they may be in or may have been in to make it spooky to them in particular. So they'll feel like it applies to them.<br>  <br>  Minor voice dynamics are great. But never NEVER end your story with the long dramatic pause followed by yelling some surprise thing. It's cliche and will be perceived as a joke. The best way to end a scary story is abruptly or to taper off.<br>  <br>  -- If you need a full-blown written story, e-mail me at lollipopxsweets@yahoo.com but mind you, it'll take a day of two.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, if you need one quick and can't think of one, search "Cat in Glass."

Not kidding..<br>  Here's what<br>  happened:<br>  2<br>  years ago, 2005, on a lonely winter night filled<br>  with lots<br>  of<br>  snow<br>  in<br>  Chichago, a teen girl was brutally murdered, <br>  yes, after<br>  being<br>  raped.She<br>  had received a text message from her boyfriend<br>  to meet him<br>  at<br>  the<br>  pub<br>  they always meet at hours before her death. She<br>  went there,<br>  nicely<br>  dressed up. Upon reaching, her drunken boyfriend <br>  stumbled<br>  out of<br>  the<br>  pub<br>  and began to vigoursly kissed her on her face<br>  and lips. She<br>  struggled<br>  and<br>  when finally broke free, started to run. But<br>  then, the boy<br>  caught<br>  up<br>  with<br>  her and pinned her to the ground. He raped her <br>  and then<br>  suffocate<br>  her.<br>  She lies on the cold floor motionless. The boy<br>  ran away and<br>  then<br>  came<br>  back much later with a chopper wrapped in<br>  newspaper and<br>  dragged<br>  the<br>  girl's body to an alley. He unwrapped the <br>  newspaper off the<br>  chopper<br>  and<br>  chopped the girl's body parts, her hands, legs,<br>  and lastly<br>  head..<br>  Since<br>  then, whenever people passed the place where the<br>  girl was<br>  being<br>  raped<br>  and<br>  suffocated, they swore they heard a girl panting <br>  and<br>  whispering<br>  in<br>  their<br>  ears 'You are walking on the place where I was<br>  killed...'<br>  and<br>  then<br>  they<br>  would heard a shrill laughter..

I am black and he is white. I'm not going to lie to you. At first, it wasn't "hard" but it was different then what I was used to. I thought that all eyes were on us as a couple when we were in public, just judging us, and some times I was right. (We got our share of stares and rude comments), but I learned that I was the one making it a bigger deal than it really was.<br>  <br>  Some of my friends and family occasionally make stupid jokes or remarks, but I know it's all in good humor, that they aren't meant to intentionally hurt us. Because they know me, and they know my boyfriend. They know our character. Other than the small jokes, it has never been an issue of "omg, why are you dating that white boy? your a sellout." People who say crap like that are racist and I don't make it a point to have racist friends. <br>  <br>  In the end, what it really comes down to is how you feel about your bf or gf. It doesn't matter what others think. They're not the ones thats gonna date them, or eventually spend  their lives with that person. Its you. If someone, anyone, makes you happy and you see yourself loving them, it would be a shame to pass that rare opportunity up on account of their skin color or what your friends/family think.

KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  It has to do with elevated hormone levels, which have caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay by the time they're in their 20s or older.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who considered themselves bisexual as teens grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of bisexuality actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in fashion.  Very often they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that will probably confuse you more.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most teens who think they're bisexual realize later that they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls started during adolescence, chances are you're completely straight and you're just going through normal hormonal turmoil.  The good thing about sexual orientation is that it always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	It's very possible you might be bisexual.|`|cHUadRYeaa	Well the first thing you have to do is imagine yourself with a girl. Do you like it? If you do then you might be bi.  I personally think that if you think about girls constantly, and are dying to know what its like to kiss one or be in a relationship with one you are bisexual.  Its just not normal for a straight girl to have those thoughts now is it? No, because most straight girls think thats disgusting. I say straight girls should act more mature. Anyway, if you find a girl that you like and she likes you back, I think you should be in a relationship with her. You never know what you're gonna like, until you try it. :)|`|BuOHv2XKaa	How did people determine their sexuality before Yahoo!

No, really.  Girls are ******* hot.  They will blow your mind with the hotness.  But unless you can truly see yourself in an actual relationship with another woman, without feeling that something is missing, than no, you are not bi.  Because there's making out with a girl on a dance floor so the guys will look at you, or that f-ing Katy Perry song, and then there's dating women and men for who they are, and not their parts.<br>  Hope I helped:)|`|4yoND1npaa	Most people (male and female) think about what it MIGHT be like to be with someone of the same sex at least once in their life. This does not mean they're bisexual or bi-curious. It's human nature. Especially with the porn industry going at the rate it's going and people being influenced by it greatly.. <br>  <br>  If you find yourself having sexual thoughts about women then you're probably bi-curious in my book. Can you see yourself doing things beyond kissing with another woman, while sober? Bi-curious. Would you be in a relationship with another woman? Bisexual!|`|IPfvar5Waa	It's easy for people to say "don't worry, you'll find out soon" but with the way society is today it's hard not to worry and think about, because you want to feel confident in who you are but obviously right now, there's a part of you you aren't sure about. But unfortunately there isn't much you can do about it, and you will just have to try to not worry and see what happens. I've been in this situation for a long time. My attraction to girls, while not been as strong as my attraction to men has been present for almost two years, if not longer. I don't think about it as much as I used to now and this will probably be the same for you. Remember being bisexual ISN'T equal attraction to both sexes (that's why I count myself as one for the time being). Hope I helped.|`|dorvAFBnaa	i would not worry about this, and there is nothing wrong with your feelings.      besides, lotsa guys feel that girls being<br>  bisexual is really cool !!!|`|UU8PAxr1aa	i say youre bicurious untill you have been intimate with a girl and liked it, after that you are a fully fledged bisexual.|`|CLCR0T0vaa	BiCurious.

lJ2baVliaa	Why I came to Christianity...<br>  <br>  1. I was a non-believer prior to coming to Christianity.  Then later I started attending a Lutheran Church.  At that time I thought I was a Christian because I believed in Jesus.  Later, I realized after reading the Word of God that I was so very wrong.  Being a Christian requires obedience as well... and when you love Christ more than life itself, you will feel that overwhelming desire to be obedient.<br>  <br>  2. What made me become a real Christian was my sister.  I had spent so much time trying to bring others to Christ... living a life that was far from Christ like.  I still did my own thing after everyone was gone and the Church was out.  During this time I was trying to minister to my little sister.  But she was upset with me one time because I was "bugging" her about it.  And she said "what kind of Christian are you showing people?"  That made me take a hard long look at myself!  I realized I had only been going through the motions... I was not a real Christian.<br>  <br>  3. What pushed me over the edge was my sister... making me fully realize and see I was only going through the motions and wasn't really living the life of a Christian.  I accepted Jesus as my Lord and Savior, and was baptized on Easter of 2008.  I started to read God's Word... and I started to see what He wanted me to see... I am addicted to reading His Word now.  I'm also equally addicted to obeying God's Word!<br>  <br>  4. I think I added a lot of details above lol  But I'll add this... Some of the Scriptures that inspired me are... John 3:16, Matthew 7:21, Matthew 10:37-38, Matthew 10:32-33, Matthew 28:19-20, Matthew 6:14-15, John 14:15, John 15:10, Romans 5:8, Romans 12:2, 1 Corinthians 10:12-13, Acts 2:38, ... these are just a very few of the Scriptures that inspired me!  I can give you a complete list if you want.<br>  <br>  Litha<br>  <br>  P.S. My sister is now a Christian... :)|`|nmC7qgtZaa	Born into a catholic family the priests were bastards they made donating to the church a competition where you had to be seen to keep up with your neighbours and many of them were abusing children, also I think the catholic church has done far more evil then good and is unbeleiveavly hypocritical I also find the whole christian story to be absurd and unbeleiveable|`|FlmQ2MYNaa	I came to Christianity because I was lead to.  It felt right, and it gives me such peace and happiness. <br>  <br>  1)I grew up in a Baptist Church, but I don't label myself "Baptist."  I am a Christian and don't believe everything that Baptists believe. <br>  2)I saw my Father overcome alcoholism (he's been sober 16 years,) and influences from my church, friends, and family. <br>  3)The one event that pushed me over the edge occurred at a Pentecostal church.  During the service, I felt God's presence, and it overwhelmed me, and that day I asked God to come into my heart. <br>  4)  Since that day, my life has only improved.  I don't think anyone needs proof to feel God's presence.

(no offense intended) I was born and raised Christian, but as i got older I noticed so many inconsistencies in the Bible that it confused me.  How could the word of God be inconsistent?  It does not make sense to me that God's word could say completely two different things about many issues.  Another reason was the church's battle against evolution.  I have never believed that I was created from dirt or that women were to be beneath men.  I am a lesbian, and I also do not believe that my true love for my lover is wrong.  How could true love ever be wrong?  There are many other small reasons but these are the big ones.<br>  2. ) I was raised a Christian<br>  3. ) Now I am a Pagan.  i don't follow any specific path.  I believe in the power of nature and that there is no true God, but rather there are spirits all around us than aid us in our life.  I believe that spirituality is very important, and it is important to trust the spirits around you. (animals, plants, ect.) I believe these spirits have much knowledge and are very wise if you choose to listen to them.  I also believe that we are reincarnated.  I do not believe that we are human in every life, but we are many different creatures, and we are learning to be a wise spirit, like the ones I "worship." Once we have sufficient knowledge, compassion and wisdom, we are elevated to a spirit form, where we help those still searching.  I hope this wasn't too long for you.  :)|`|AA11115051	I was a Catholic so technically I was already a Christian, as I began my journey I had many things to say about my Christian brothers but as I have matured and learned I've understood many things. <br>  GOD made me believe, HE has a way to explain things like no other, full of wisdom, deep meaning, and dare I say art. Personally I don't speak tongues or anything like that but GOD has used me to reveal many things, so I feel very blessed. And at the same time so unworthy but we're not worthy of salvation either yet receieve it as a gift from GOD. I love GOD. Everyday you walk with him is a good day no matter what the enemy has prepared for you they will not prevail. Only until the end  of times will Satan have the power to wage war against us and win. There many things I could discuss but what the Holy Bible is a message of Love. GOD loves you and wants you to be with him but  if you don't open the door how can he come in?|`|aZvWDxqvaa	I like your question and please understand if I consider the follow up questions moot. I think you will understand after I answer.<br>  <br>  My coming to Christ has nothing to do with evidence or some preacher tickling my ear. I was drawn to Christ Jesus by the Holy Spirit due to the Father's will. The fact that I call myself a Christian or make a public stand that I am is just due to the work of God Himself. It is similar to when a baby is born and the doctor smacks his behind and the baby cries to let you know he or she is alive. The same is for a Christian when they are born again. To be clear, God initiated and gave the faith so that I may accept Him as Lord and Savior.<br>  <br>  As for my former religion there was none.<br>  <br>  And as for those who have left Christianity, it really doesn't matter why they did. In 1 John 1:19 it says; "They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us." So ultimately they were only Christian in name only not by the Spirit.|`|gLyD1CiIaa	I don't believe there was ever a time I did not believe in God. <br>  <br>  He came to me in my dreams even before the age of five. I remember how the women in my kindergarden Sunday school were amazed by my understanding of God. Yet, I only knew what he revealed to me. <br>  <br>  When I was in school, I was excited to learn to read so I could read the Word of God. Once I learned to read, I was without understanding. Yet, regardless, reading God's Word made me feel closer to him. <br>  <br>  When I learned God's commandments, I became aware of my sin and can recall the day my spirit inside me died. For the first time in my life I felt alone, apart from God. Yet, he did not forsake me.<br>  <br>  At the age of fifteen, I was invited to a youth for Christ get away weekend at the local YMCA. <br>  <br>  On the night we were to leave, on Sunday, there was a church service. It was here I finally understood. For my heart became convicted and I knew I needed to be saved/born again. <br>  <br>  The Lord came into my heart like a rushing wind. I wept like never before and when it was all said and done, I was a new creature in Christ. All things had become new to me, as it is written in the Word of God.|`|ynRNSKpMaa	1) I grew up raised in a Christian home. I never believed any other belief besides Christianity. <br>  <br>  2) Some people think being raised in a Christian home, that you are bound to believe what your parents believe. Kind of like being manipulated into it. But that is not true. Growing up in a Christian home, kids with Christian parents struggle a lot to believe in God themselves, to make Jesus a part of their life. You were raised to believe that without thinking and listening on your own, it was just always there. How would you know really if it was true or not? There was always a tug of war. Unlike people who weren't raised and had a miracle happen in there life to draw them to their knees, for kids growing up in a Christian home it was just always there without any substance. Instead of being more drawn to it because it surrounded my life, I sort of walked away from it. But I saw when I walked away from God, I saw how much more my life got worse without him playing a major role in my life, so I sought after him again. He was always there!<br>  <br>  3) Seeing what my life was like without me involving him in any of it, even though he was always by my side and I just ignored him, life just got worse when I wouldn't let him in. I made bad mistakes and made wrong choices, but in the end he made those bad things turn into good and has richly blessed my life immensely.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Why I left:<br>  <br>  1) All of the above and the hate it causes "you will go to hell"<br>  2) Parents<br>  3) Atheist|`|AA11923447	I am a lifelong Christian. I was raised in a devoutly religious home, and belong to the same denomination in which I was raised. I haven't left Christianity yet, but am admittedly considering it. <br>  <br>  (1) Things that are pushing me away include an overall lack of proof for certain religious claims ("because the Bible says so" is not a rational argument), my lack of interest in Biblical literalism, and my outright rejection of homophobia, sexism, intolerance and other traits that I find both repellant and immoral. It is becoming increasingly difficult to defend my faith when it is being constantly sabotaged from the inside by people who think that spreading bigotry in the name of Christ is acceptable. I am creeped out by people who go around gleefuly consigning other people to Hell. I do not agree with a fair amount of my own denomination's dogma. I am not sure that I am 100% monotheistic. <br>  <br>  (2) I was raised a Christian, and was not allowed to ask questions about my religion. However, after my parents died (that happened when I was a teenager), I made a conscious decision to remain a member of my family's religion. I did a great deal of research into other faiths, but couldn't find one that moved me as much spiritually. <br>  <br>  (3) As I've already said, I'm still a Christian. I may, when it's all said and done, remain a Christian. But I'm also interested in Paganism (particularly Baltic Paganism, ásatrú, and Heathenry in general), pantheism, deism, non-theistic Paganism, non-theistic Christianity (yes, it exists), esoteric Christianity, chaos magick, and other paths. I have not made a final decision yet.|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	I was born into a christian family, but it didn't really catch on with me.  As a small child, I bought it but it stopped making sense to me by age 10.  <br>  <br>  1.  Lack of proof, initally.  Then my burgeoning logic and education further convinced me that religion didn't really have the right answers.<br>  <br>  2.  Born into christian family.  And, as a small naive child, those biblical stories and ideas filled me with wonder.<br>  <br>  3.  No religion.  I have yet to find a religion that makes sense to me and don't see what I'd have to gain by joining one.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I left.<br>  <br>  1) I'm gay, and I didn't choose to be.

I've had spiritual experience/visions since childhood.<br>  <br>  3. see no.2<br>  <br>  I 1st left the church when the right wing conservatives infiltrated and took over. It them became impossible in some churches to do anything but toe the party line. So in essence, the Moral Majority and Religious Right hijacked my religion.<br>  <br>  I've been scientific and logical from the beginning. I'm from a family of scientists and engineers. This has never negated the teachings of the Christ regarding love and compassion.<br>  <br>  I now walk a spiritual path away from organized religion. It is similar in nature to esoteric Christianity and theosophy. I practice spiritual alchemy and meditation as a means of purification of the mind, emotions and body.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	1: i was atheist when i was born, but my parents took me to sunday school every week and brainwashed me whilst i was young and vulnerable, simply because thats what everyone else does<br>  <br>  2: all of the above, science, lack of logic, lack of proof, war, the crusades and millions upon millions of deaths in the name of religion over the centuries|`|zMcHYQeBaa	God led me and I believed in His Son.

vGA8CWnZaa	With reading just the top two lines, I answer: your JW "friend" is only your "friend" because they are intent on selling their religon to you.  I fact, all religious "friends" do that because "that's what they are supposed to do".<br>  <br>  It's all tied in with her religion.  There MAY be a percentage of her not wanting to be that way, mind you.  You must find it within yourself to determine how much of what she says to be something SHE IS STRUGGLING WITH or she simply doesn't care.  I doubt there is a large level of uncaring because of the amount of time you have spent as friends.<br>  <br>  She is probably working through the brainwashing that she has to go through.  Drop religion, and you drop the brainwashing.  It is NOT near as easy for a child to do this with strict parents.<br>  <br>  If anything, care for her brain because that is what is being harmed at this point in life.  Children's brain functions are a thousand times more receptive than an adult's brain functions.  It just seems like adults are smarter because they are more experienced.|`|AA12360579	Why on earth are you friends with her still?  If she was constantly nagging at me about my makeup, I'd tell her that she can either shut up about it or leave.  If she argued with me about religion, she can either shut up about it or leave.  Don't take crap from her just because she is *sometimes* nice.  If she can't respect you ALL the time, she's not a true friend.|`|8OHsqwo6aa	despite how long you known her and how much fun she is these are not the actions of a friend if you've tried to talk to her without any or negative results try telling her when she's being judgmental that she is not God and that she should "judge not lest ye be judged"|`|WuKI9WiVaa	Tell her that you love her (as a friend) but the critsizing needs to stop, at least around you.

I hope it turns out okay!|`|BfnVCjh2aa	be strait up with her. tell her how you feel about all of this. take her away from everyone and talk to her 1 on 1 about it. u respect her beliefs so she should respect yours and ur friends. its could be a phase, i like to argue with my friends about thier relgions but i respect what they believe, maybe shes the same but without the respect part. just talk to her about it and see where it goes from there.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	She is dependent upon you.  She needs you to argue with, she needs you to make her feel better about herself, and she needs you to make her religion seem relevant by knocking yours.

If you want to work with your best friend, then go for it. When she makes fun of your religion, ignore her, or just politely disagree. If she's making fun of you for wearing make up- telling you that you look bad, ignore her again. If she continues to say these things and p*ss you off, then give her an ultimatum: "either stop being a b*tch or we stop being friends!" type of thing.<br>  <br>  -Tila.

However I find white, Eastern Asian or Eurasian men the most attractive and white for women. But I would open to any race.

bbWzitisaa	asexual is a term used for a certain type of reproduction common in plants, and some animals. by taking a piece from a plant, you can grow an entirely new plant if done properly. as for animals, such as starfish, they grow all the necessary parts for the second animal to live, and after all the parts are grown and function properly, it detaches from the animal...<br>  <br>  asexual is also a term used for people who are not attracted to either sex. they have no desire to be with a man or a woman. it causes no excitement for them. it is pretty much the opposite of being bisexual, by going both ways. asexual does not go either way. hope i helped, and sorry if my animal knowledge is not that accurate...i just go off what i know.|`|9HeQd7cNaa	It means you can get yourself pregnant, or have kids, by yourself.|`|2lim0SHvaa	It just means no sex drive.<br>  No desire for sex.|`|Eo9ZdKqvaa	no sex drive whatsoever|`|UU8PAxr1aa	bisexual means you are attracted to both.<br>  asexual means you are attracted to neither.<br>  so you have zero sex drive.... too bad!|`|QVs4ZRx4aa	Not interested in either sex.|`|9i4VLJjJaa	you have the power to give 10 points?|`|eXiSIaQcaa	asexual means that you dont like girls, guys or anything in between lol!!! hope this helps|`|BuOHv2XKaa	How can you label yourself without knowing the meaning of the label?<br>  <br>  It means you lost your sex drive from puffing too much marijuana.|`|WJuZ64rhaa	How can you label your self without knowing its meaning.<br>  Asexual means that you don't desire or crave sex at all.

It is not OK to come to bed with your butt half-wiped and expect your partner to have sex with you while you smell like dirty butt. That is grounds to refuse sex. If he can't handle that, maybe it's more important him to smell like butt than it is to get married to you, which means you should find a man who cares more about you.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	I think it is time to find a new boyfriend/fiance. This is harsh to say but if I play your relationship forward in my head, in a few years, it will get worse and worse. I don't know any relationship where habits got better with time instead of worse. Hygiene is very important. This will eventually drive you crazy.<br>  <br>  I am not a hairy guy but occasionally I shower after the toilet if convenient. Hairy guys I am sure have a problem more often than I do in that area. Of course not trying to stay clean is a whole other issue and I think that is his problem. <br>  <br>  You can do better. Do it soon.|`|9uI3hvGdaa	That is absolutely disgusting!!!  I thought my bf's habits were bad when I met him, but compared to yours, mine is Mr. Clean.  Sorry dear, but I'd run for the hills.

Keep a "bum kit" handy by the bed.  In it, you can have some cloths, tissues, Tucks (since you like), engine degreaser, Liquid Lava, and toilet cleaner for the heavy duty days.  Add some moisturizers and lotions and you're all set.  A few minutes attention to each other's bungholes will have you ready for some mad love making!<br>  <br>  Seriously, I think this is just gross.  You sound like an intelligent person that values good hygiene.  Not to pick on you, but what exactly happened to make you attracted to such a pig?  Not that I've been a butt inspector, but I've never knowingly even maintained a friendship...let alone an intimate relationship...with anyone with poor hygiene.<br>  <br>  This is the funniest question I've seen in a long time...but, at the same time, I feel bad for anyone that feels stuck with a pig.|`|AA10211580	Ewwww gross roflmao. What I do is take an empty water bottle and fill it with soap and water and shake it and pour it down my butt while I'm sitting on the toilet. I taught my spouse to do the same thing for sanitary purposes. You use less toilet paper this way and it feels good too hehehehehehe. And we do this when we go out too. <br>  My mom's a nurse and she taught me how to be hygenic. She would come home with stories from patients because alot of them don't know how to wash their privates (and these are young and old women too for example). And she complains that when they drop their drawers, then a strong stench from their privates fumigates the room. LOLz. I'm glad I'm not a nurse cuz I wouldn't be able to keep a straight face.
8OHsqwo6aa	in june of last year my husband and i went homeless and ended up sleeping in his cousins van in a trailer park.  turns out this cousin has a daughter with a production company.  now we have a record deal that take us to the big show.|`|d5g4dt2uaa	Very often: let's see, here's two:<br>   I've gotten put on committees when I was swamped with work and then met resourceful people on the committee who gave me insight into things to bring more balance into my life.<br>  <br>  Had two ladies (coworkers) who used to try and sabotage me or things I did. I overlooked the pettiness of it. When one of them struck out on her own (opened a business), she asked me to contract with her when business was booming b/c she did not trust the other lady who gossiped and threw the rock/hid the hand. I made loads of money as a consultant.|`|7J9Eb3VCaa	Ok so this sounds just awful but I was with my current boyfriend for 3 years the intimacy just wasn't there any more so I started to feel useless and not attractive to him anymore. I started craving attention and cheated on him. This went on for a few months then he knew about it and denied it while we were still dating a little. I was with this other guy for about 8 months it was a complete mess he just got out of a divorce and had a two year old with another one coming. His ex wife actually gave birth while we were seeing each other. He was so depressed and was being tortured by her emotionally on so many levels including taking the kids away, getting remarried and having her husband adopt the kids. I was just there simply the keep her off his mind. I was just there for attention while I was still deeply in love with my current boyfriend. So we were just using each other. My life started to spiral out of control with this guy we started partying every night, and get into blowout fights he was an alcoholic and the relationship was full of emotional abuse. This guy ended up committing suicide in front of me. I was so messed up and my current boyfriend was there for me the whole time when no way should he have been. He took me back thank God. He told me I was extremely close to losing him for good he just couldn't take it anymore. Of course I have to work hard every single day to prove to him he made the right decision. We are happier than ever, and still going strong. My blessing in disguise as awful as this sounds was my late boyfriend commiting suicide. My life had hit rock bottom and probably would have kept going until I was in a mess way over my heard, along with my relationship with my boyfriend. It was probably one of the biggest blessings I've ever had, losing my boyfriend would have been devastating and I wouldn't be as happy as I am now. I still respect my late boyfriend I talk to his parents and help console them. We just weren't in the relationship for the right reasons and he needed help that was way to much for me to be expected to handle.

I mean I am guilty of saying it myself. :/|`|lPPgMKibaa	i agree, its so stupid|`|GOYuWN4zaa	i think the way someone says something can make a big difference. i myself say thats so gay and being a gay chick i dont have anything against gay people. for me its all in the way they say it. like if my friends walked up to me and said sup lesbian, i would care because it was used as a term of endearment. but if some random person yells ******* lesbian and i dont know them then thats a little different.|`|8Vz9JF7paa	i guess you could relate to it being the same thing as if you were to say "omg that's so cool" they are not saying that the object or thing is actually "cold" its just a term society over time has adopted to a word used to describe something... hell i even say it sometimes and IAM GAY lol.... <br>  <br>  not much we can do but it's a trend... fad.... it will change with time :)|`|a9dcd2dcf0213f6369172febcd8afe67aa	Your friend is obviously really insightful.

So when the child continues using gay as an insult and their parents won't do anything about it or their friends, teachers, etc. they will continue using it.<br>  <br>  it's kind of dumb how some parents these days thinks it's strange to talk to their child about homosexual people and stuff.  but eh, people have their ways of raising children I guess.|`|yQ43Bu5Zaa	Yeah it is pretty immature.<br>  <br>  <br>  But most people are saying it these days so it's best to not let it upset you too much.|`|eOISRiiQaa	ya its so annoying

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

Research all these things FOR YOURSELF!|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	What makes you think that God would end it on December 21st, 2012 just because the Mayans thought it was going to end. True, God will make the world end. Remember Noah's Ark? At that time God regretted creating humans, for they were sinful. He saved Noah and his family for being so righteous, and then vowed never again to do it.<br>  <br>  The Book of Revelation in the Bible is one of the best-known texts on end times. It doesn't give a specific date.<br>  <br>  Also, the Mayans, like every other civilization, had their own religion and Gods. They believed that three worlds were created before ours. Each was destroyed because it's humans were defective and unable to worship the Gods. We've only lasted so long because are the true people, made out of maize, a sacred corn to the Mayan. They say the end of this world is (you guessed it) December 21th, 2012! Now, you don't follow the Mayan religion, do you?<br>  <br>  Feel free to email me if you want some more explanations.|`|930ff9b9b121acfebc24822a66bc17a6aa	I costs nothing for God to do anything, but it cost us a lot for God to do nothing.<br>  <br>  as far as 2012 goes we will all still be here in 2013.

Do YOU not know that unrighteous persons will not inherit God’s kingdom? Do not be misled. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men kept for unnatural purposes, nor men who lie with men, 10?nor thieves, nor greedy persons, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit God’s kingdom.<br>  <br>  Pretty clear as glass as to how God feels about such things....it means our very lives.<br>  <br>  Music:<br>  The Bible tells us that “the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one,” Satan the Devil. (1?John 5:19) It should not surprise you, then, that music is one of the means Satan uses to mislead young people. Previous articles in this journal and its companion magazine, The Watchtower, have repeatedly demonstrated this fact. The cautions that have been given regarding heavy metal and rap music are also appropriate when it comes to alternative rock. As the Bible puts it, “the shrewd one considers his steps.”—Proverbs?14:15.<br>  For one thing, it makes little sense to follow after the crowd when it comes to your taste in music. Note this Bible principle, which can apply to letting others make decisions for you: “Do you not know that if you keep presenting yourselves to anyone as slaves to obey him, you are slaves of him because you obey him?” (Romans 6:16) For a Christian youth, the issue is not what is acceptable among one’s peers but what is “acceptable to the Lord.” (Ephesians 5:10) Besides, what kind of youths are drawn to alternative rock? Youths who seem to be happy, balanced, and interested in spiritual things? Or does it seem to find its audience primarily among youths who are disgruntled, unhappy, or even angry?<br>  True, some youths with cheery, upbeat personalities may still be drawn to alternative rock. But consider this: Christians, young and old, have a bright future awaiting them. (2?Peter 3:13) The apostle Paul reminds us of the certainty of the fulfillment of God’s promises, saying: “It is impossible for God to lie.” (Hebrews 6:18) What point is there, then, in exposing yourself to the bleak, negative view of the future that some alternative rock songs express? Could becoming absorbed in music that expresses fear, despair, and hopelessness undermine your faith? Furthermore, what effect might a steady diet of such music have on your emotional outlook?<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped...|`|2TavF36Daa	Paul suggested that we not give up the drinking of wine. He felt it helped with digestion.<br>  <br>  Paul did warn us against getting drunk.<br>  <br>  Not all secular music is bad. The lyrics are what makes a song good or bad.

gOzZ3lmLaa	Writing it out in romaji does give you "mugen no ikari". It's kind of hard to write it out phonetically, but I'll give it a try.<br>  <br>  The word "mugen" is a combination of into "mu" and "gen". The "mu" part sounds like "moo" or the "mo" sound in "movie". The "gen" part sounds like the "gain" part of "again".<br>  <br>  The particle "no" sounds like "know" or "no".<br>  <br>  The word "ikari" can be broken down into three parts. The first part "i" sounds like a long "e" sound. Like the "e" in "evening" or "electric". The "ka" part sounds like the "ca" sound in "car". The "ri" part is really hard to explain because the Japanese "r" sound is sort of a combination the  "R" and "L"sounds. To me "ri" almost sounds like the "re" part of "return" or "refund".<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.|`|AA10948829	Mugen no ikari

People over the internet cannot give you the help you need.  <br>   <br>  Good luck, and I will keep you in my prayers.|`|AA11974194	Call the police.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	If you have both male and female organs, but feel like you are male, then most likely you are male. You should talk with a counselor who is trained in gender identity to help you decide which gender you are.<br>  <br>  What you choose to do as far as your physical gender is up to you. If you choose to keep your female reproductive system, since it works, you could have children, and you would not be the first male with female reproductive parts who did so. But again, the counselor can help you decide the best way to go.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Identical twins cannot be different sexes.  Try again.|`|38852752ccd0ae855afeb5b23f504950aa	wow,sounds kind of scary to go through all of that and though you will be able to reproduce before you actually find your identity then you should speak to a specialist in this area.Pretty recently I was reading about a girl in India who had 4 arms and two legs and it was almost the same situation except the twin didn't grow so the individual took her twins arm and feet.It sounds to me that you are a girl and not a male.On a personal note from reading what you wrote I think you should get the surgery done because everything else you do is basically girl.My prayers are with you.God bless.|`|3CQb6PSFaa	k, i don't know what being a christian has anything to do with this, buy w/e.<br>  I heard that this actually happens sometimes, so i don't think you're lying,<br>  I think that since only your female reproductive system is the working one, you are actually a girl. If you were a boy then you the male one would work and the female one wouldn't, so be a girl.<br>  I don't know what else to say, maybe you could call yourself taylor or jamie, which are used for both genders<br>  I know this would be really hard to go through, and i want you to know that im praying for you.<br>  <br>  I hope i helped and God bless.|`|p4hWHIN9aa	Sounds like you're a girl. :-)  But the high number of girls in your family is very unusual, and there may be a genetic/developmental issue in your family.<br>  <br>  This line:  "They believe that there me and my sister were going to be triplets but one did not grow and apart of the thing got on me to make me partly a boy."<br>  <br>  Do your doctors have any proof of this? That is very serious, and if it was true then you would have the DNA of two people in your body. Did they do a test and find out that you have two sets of DNA, one of them male? If not I would get that test done. If your chromosomes in your whole body are all XX, you are a girl. Without question.   But if some are XX and some are XY that's a more complicated issue.|`|OBV4AKIXaa	I can imagine that would be completely overwhelming<br>  <br>  the best of luck to you|`|AA10566295	I'm not sure why you mention Christianity in your headline. I don't know what that has to do with it. It sounds like you might be a hermaphrodite. If the doctors messed up on you, you should have been able to sue and make a lot of money. The only reason I think this question is even real is because you spell badly, like a 12 year old. First of all, get a real therapist, not someone you call "uncle". That sounds kind of weird. Get a real psychologist. If you feel romantic and sexual attachment to boys then you should probably be a girl. If you are ambivalent about what you want to be, I would suggest moving to a big city one day where you can explore your options more. There is nothing wrong with being "in between" or a transvestite or some other sexually ambiguous person. (Unless you live in a rural, small country town where people are very religious and conservative, then you will have nothing but misery). Don't do anything permanent until you are an adult. Good luck, and if you really are a believing Christian, praying never hurts!|`|zb4tj2ZZaa	Well you just seem that you'll be fine to me. Probably the only difference is that you'll have a lot more room in your pants.
mptnpn9maa	By your last question it is clear to me that you do not understand the foundation of Judaism at all. This is not your fault. You've just been seeking answers in the wrong places.  However, thank you for addressing this question specifically to the Jewish Community. It gives us an opportunity to respond.  Judaism is a religion based on learning, contemplation and discovering new perspectives and explanations of the Old Testament. Rabbinic scholars devote their lives to uncovering new meanings to the word of G-d the Holy Scriptures, the Torah. The faith is one of heart and soul.  Our most important prayer, The Shema states "You shall love the lord your G-d with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your might."  These words we place on the doorway of nearly every room in our homes so we can touch and kiss the word of G-d throughout the day, to show we never, ever forget Him. Very observant men wear fringes beneath their clothing so this too serves as a constant reminder of the holiness and ever presents of G-d.  In fact, just writing His name with out the "o" is in reverence to G-d because the Lords name should not be taken in vain.  Do you think that G-d would see this as a group of people who've gone astray?  Do you think He would turn away those who have given their entire heart and soul to Him throughout their entire lives?  I would rather question a belief system that implies that complete devotion and love of G-d is not enough. Additionally, we believe in Tikkun Olam -Heal the World. Everyday we are to live our lives in a way that brings healing to the world by doing good deeds, community service or simply helping a neighbor, lending a hand or providing a shoulder for someone to cry on. This comes not out of duty, but from the heart and from the soul,  Does that sound like people who have been led astray?  Only you can answer these questions for yourself.  You are inquisitive enough to ask and ponder. so I leave these thoughts in your hands.|`|DTog0VZWaa	Your are coming at this without any understanding of Judaism, so the question makes no sense at all in Judaism.<br>  <br>  Here's a starting point:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org</a><br>  <br>  =====<br>  As for priests, we do not have priests.  We have people from the priest tribe, but they are not priests & they do not have rolls as teachers of any special sort.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  Truth <br>  You are currently "led astray" yourself.  Look at how intolerant your answer is.  It contains classic anti-Jewish commentary -- stuff used to excuse killling Jews.  You may not mean to.  However, this stuff shouldn't even be thought.  "Led astray" was the battle cry for many an inquisition & pogrom.  I hope you find God, because what you've found now is intolerance & lack of "thinking outside the box."  Judaism is nothing like what you think it is.  It happens to be the opposite of the pictures you've painted -- Jews are leaders in thinking outside the box because of our religion.  I sincerely hope you spend some time at the sites listed & form a real curiousity to learn about us.  BTW anything talking about Yeshua but claiming to be Jewish is just a form of Christianity that being deciteful in order to convert Jews (they aren't very tolerant of us either)...so please don't accidently think you've found valid data at one of those sites.|`|AA11992885	God makes reference to the teachers OF THAT TIME, that does not mean teachers of all times.....you have to consider WHO is being spoken to............if all teachers lead people astray, then ANY organized religion is wrong, and Moses was wrong as well, as he too was a teacher<br>  <br>  consider what time frame is being spoken of......just because it is being said to a people of 2500 years ago does not mean it still applies today<br>  <br>  La Nokta Besto, you say that the Jewish people don't have priests, maybe you are the one who needs to stop talking about matters you know nothing about, the Jewish people certainly DO have priests, we simply do not have priests actively fulfilling their roles as "priests" because of a lack of a temple, but that doesn't mean that our priests don't also teach|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I think you have no business questioning anybody else's faith.<br>  <br>  Jewish people don't have priests, they have rabbis. I don't think you really know a thing about Judaism, which makes it even more hypocritical for you to be judging it.|`|AA11974194	The true god is Zeus, but that's who you are talking about, right?

rOY2J0UAaa	Stheneboea was her name and she tried to seduce Bellerophon. He rejected her and so she lied to her husband - King Proetus and made it seem as though Bellerophon had made advances toward her.  Proetus sent Bellerophon to the King of Lycia - King Iobates, with a sealed request that Bellerophon be put to death. Iobates believed the best way to do this was challenge him to slay the Chimaera which he did. I believe he pushed her off Pegasus, falling to her death, as some form of revenge.
7FvoCW7Vaa	I had a chance to spend about a month in Perth and Freemantle when I was in the navy. The people there were awesome. I traveled to a lot of different places and meet a lot of different people and Australians were probably the coolest, most laid back people. They are just like everyone else. Don't portray that "ugly American" attitude that some people have labeled us with and everything will be cool!|`|90tPT5nlaa	No, of course Australians don't hate Americans. Sadly a few individuals in the past have led to a stereotype of Americans being loud and ignorant, but you'll find that Aussies take everbody as they come. If you are friendly and polite then we are too. There are many Americans livng in Australia, and I believe the majority haven't had any problems with 'anti-Americanism'.

b18359bbf206246662ddcfc580bc68f1aa	Assuming you eat a balanced diet and do these exercises 4-5 times a week, you should begin to see results within 4-6 weeks. With all of your exercises, you should gradually increment each one until you can do fifty or more. Do 25 for each, then repeat each set. For the little pudge, I would suggest you also throw in leg-lifts also. These are really good for tightening the belly muscles.
33E9E96iaa	Well, it's very unlikely and probably impossible. Though I have heard stories about people stolen by faeries slowly becoming a faerie as they live out an eternity in captivity, usually servitude as well. And most humanoid faeries are about from the size of a child to a tall woman, most faeries don't even look human in the first place. And the only powers are your basic Glamour (disguise) Healing (rumor only) and a few rather mundane powers like souring milk and causing dogs to go lame. Faeries aren't like Tinkerbelle, they are usually evil or mean. Even the nice ones can turn on you in an instant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And as far as figuring out if you are one, do you have at least 5 of these chararastics?<br>  <br>  1.voracious appetite<br>  2.malicious temper<br>  3.difficulty in movement<br>  4.

But to answer your question, the only stories I have ever heard of where this is possible is by taking some sort of potion/mixture that only the fairies have. Even then you don't really become a fairy, you just gain a bunch of their properties. And it isn't permanent either, it wears off over time. But the problem would still be finding and robbing a fairy of the materials needed.|`|EWR01atlaa	Hun,<br>  I'm sorry. I do believe in vampires, werewolves,mermaids, and other things.

After they've got enough information they create a doppelganger and kidnap you, putting the doppelganger in your place. Nobody notices you're missing because of the doppelganger and you're stuck in the realm of Faerie for a decade or two until you escape. Unfortunately the doppelganger is still occupying your place in the world, so you can't go back. On the bright side, now you're a fairy.|`|z8YZqmQ5aa	Honey. Ok read.

Then explain a few more, and ask a few more questions...<br>  Maybe, if your phrases include questions, you can ask the students to read their phrases out loud in a random order you give them. Let's say you give the students a number, without knowing which phrase they hold in their hands, and then they have to read in the order of the numbers. This could give very hilarious "conversations"...|`|4qmqN18Laa	make groups (of 4 or 5) give them a phrase and tell them to repreent them with mimic, with a little performance..give each group like 5 or 6 min. to get ready and at the end of each you give the class the origin of this phrase.... <br>  or<br>  give on papers the phrases to some guys ask them to read them out loud and ask if anyone knows the phrase or it's origin.... , put the papers on the board and write the ideas that they say... <br>  or<br>  get a small ball, put the bench in a circule and (I don't know how many phrases do you have but..) make groups and give them a paper with a phrase on it.. let them read and do your explanation...  throw the ball to choose another group.(or let the first group choose another group by throwing the ball)<br>  <br>  the clip would be peferct, but I don't know here you can get it... and I don't know the phrases that you plann to use... so... hope this helps... <br>  <br>  bye..

MPX0f5jzaa	Lizzie, you're receiving a scandalous amount of misinformation here.  Whether the kid is Orthodox, Conservative, Reconstructionist or Reform, if the mother isn't Jewish (I don't care what she practices, I'm talking about how she was born or converted), then the kid is NOT JEWISH.<br>  <br>  I don't care what anybody here says, they have no idea.  Don't take it from a bunch of non-Jews guessing, I'm telling you you can only be Jewish if your mother is/was Jewish OR if you yourself have converted.<br>  <br>  If the mother was born Jewish and chooses not to practice it or once converted to Judaism THEN stopped practicing it, only then would the kid be Jewish.<br>  <br>  Absolutely NO REAL RABBI would ever do that, I don't care anybody thinks.  There is corruption everywhere.  If that person gets the bat mitzvah, then tries to marry in a Jewish wedding later, the rabbi will refuse her for being a non-Jew.  This is VERY serious.|`|AA11974194	Apparently the rabbi conducting the service believes so.|`|1cJjGNOBaa	Only a Jewish 13 year old girl can become Bat Mitzvah (a daughter of the commandment). If your dad is Jewish and you have been raised as a Jew in the Reform movement, than YES, you can and will become bat mitzvah. The Conservative and Orthodox movements do not recognize paternal lineage and you would have had to convert before being allowed to read torah. All Jewish kids become bar or bat mitzvah simply by virtue of reaching the age of 13- no ceremony required. But, we DO like to mark such a wonderful occasion with the child leading the service for that week and reading torah for the first time. Hopefully, if you have been raised as a Jew and are becoming bat mitzvah, your Catholic mom is supportive. Mazel tov!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	Are you getting one?  Then yes it's probably ok by Jewish law, right?  I don't think it's ok with Catholic law - I can tell you that for sure!  You are sinning in the eyes of GOD and Jesus (joke, I don't care about what the Catholics say, they're all hypocrites) for not converting to Catholicism and they'll always consider you to be a misguided soul.|`|19922ecff123841b68f933197d10192baa	I would think, that if you're mother was Catholic, you would receive Confirmation.|`|F0uLexezaa	Reform Judaism also recognizes paternal lineage|`|i4qLkYAJaa	it all depends. Orthodox Jews believe that the child is only jewish if the mother is jewish. I don't think it matters for Reform Jews.|`|vGA8CWnZaa	If my dad was a priest and my mom was a nun does IT count?|`|OBV4AKIXaa	I don't see why it wouldn't

9uI3hvGdaa	Yes, I tip 15-20% depending on how good she was.|`|zNjACkxpaa	I am in the US and I tip my hair dressers, in fact I tip them a lot. <br>  <br>  In the US tipping is expected in all service industries; hair dressers, waiter staff, doormen, cleaning staff, taxi drivers, bell hops, sky caps.<br>  <br>  You are actually supposed to tip the shampoo person at the hair salon as well. <br>  <br>  Just an FYI in the US the stylist doesn't keep that ￡30  you are paying it is collected a percentage is paid back to them. In most salon the stylists "rents" their chair for 50 - 70 % of what they make so tips are very important.<br>  <br>  I pay $29 US for a hair cut and usually tip $20 to my stylist.|`|AA12204752	It is customary to tip in the U.S. , if you think your stylist is worth it. Being an independent stylist , I have to buy all my products and rent my space. I keep all high quality products, give my full attention, and they are my boss while in my chair. It does feel good to be appreciated.|`|04Te5gzzaa	Since tipping is not common in Europe, I wouldn't bother with tipping.  In the US, it's normal to tip someone 15-20% in the service industry.  I was in China last year where tipping is not standard practice either so I just listened to my girlfriend (who's from there) and did not tip the hairdresser after he was done cutting my hair.  I guess they get paid enough that tips are not required...unlike the US where most people in the service industry rely on tips because they're getting like minimum wage.|`|o2pmDiXXaa	You should because that is mostly how they get paid,and if you didn't tip them they'd probably get pissed off and the next time you came if you got that person they'd probably give you a crappy haircut|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	In this country we seem to tip for everything. I usually tip my barber 5 dollars on a 20 dollar bill.|`|aQVQUgIaaa	I personally do tip hairdressers just because that's what i've learned to do. I did read a similar article though that you generally tip anyone that provides a "service" to you, individually, (waiters, bussers, haridressers, nail technicians, people who do massages...). Though i don't tip as if they are a waiter, i tip less because they don't claim their tips like waiters have to.

05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	I have. My daughter is. the two years fly by. Some people quit early. (Some don't even finish training.) You are free to do so, but you will be letting people down, including yourself.<br>  <br>  Your question about freedom is hard to answer. You'll have a job to do. You'll have laws to obey. You are representing your country and a proud organization. You get two vacation days a month, which you can take once a month or let accumulate. You get weekends off, on many jobs. (I was at a boarding school, and every once in a while I had to supervise the kids who lived too far away to go home on a weekend.) <br>  <br>  The Peace Corps can send you home for not doing your job properly. The host country can arrest you for breaking their laws. Did you mean freedom as compared to living in an army barracks, or freedom to quit early, or what?<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=learn.whyvol.finben" rel="nofollow">http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shel...</a><br>  <br>  Deferment of Student Loans<br>  Volunteers may defer repayment of student loans under several federal programs, i.e., Stafford (formerly known as guaranteed student loans), Perkins, direct and consolidation loans. Some commercial loans may also be deferred during Peace Corps service. Because the rules that authorize deferment are complicated and subject to change, it is best to talk to a Peace Corps recruiter about how this benefit applies to your situation.<br>  <br>  Cancellation of Student Loans<br>  Only Volunteers with Perkins loans are eligible for a partial cancellation benefit. Fifteen percent of your Perkins loans can be cancelled upon the completion of each 365 days of service during your first two years of service, and 20 percent can be cancelled upon completion of each of the third and fourth years. Therefore, four full years of service would equal a 70 percent cancellation of your existing loan.<br>  <br>  =========================<br>  <br>  Last year they had 11,000 applicants and took 4,000 of them. Your fears may be moot.|`|GMIsOYYCaa	Since you said "strict" after you referred to the "2 year commitment", I'll assume that you mean freedom to quit. Well, the Peace Corps isn't the Army. You can quit anytime you want. But just because you are a volunteer doesn't mean that you aren't held to a level of commitment. You will be assigned to a host family, who will be jumping through hoops to make sure that you feel comfortable in their country. Is it okay to just "quit" on them? You will be assigned a job, and will be expected to follow through with that job, just like any employment in the US. Is it okay to just quit on your boss and colleagues? There will be many people who are counting on you.<br>  <br>  You may have also been referring to social freedom. You won't be living in America, you'll be living in a third world country far far away. The culture will be entirely different than yours. You probably won't be "free" to have your own space or privacy, to eat the things you want to eat, to say whats really on your mind, or even to walk the streets alone at night. The freedoms people take for granted here in America are not given to those in the countries the PC serves, and people find this out very quickly.<br>  <br>  Service in the Peace Corps can get you loan cancellations and deferments. Specifically, Perkins loans are subject to 15% cancellation for each year you are in the PC. Stafford loans can be deferred the entire time you are away. The Peace Corps will not cancel and defer your loans for you; you must call up your lender and figure out how to do this yourself before you ship out.

For me to be born int he 80's it was mostly for me i saw int he 80's, like beverhilly cops , Eddie Murphy. He was the most popular black man in movies. For music you got Michael jackson, then he became white.loolz <br>  <br>  In America there was more racism there compared to UK, so this is why they are represented more. Not forgettign the white bed sheets with 2 holes for eyes used by K.K.K<br>  <br>  Im going to end it, in order to build america, they used the black people as slave.

So if there was to be any intelligent life form there..we would detect some form of radiation they might be using like we do way before actually seeing their space ship flying on our sky. They cant just discover the use of microwaves and radio waves and so on and build a space ship that can travel nearly as fast as light within 4 years...can they?

5JqCObDSaa	Analytical skill is the ability to visualize, articulate, and solve complex problems and concepts, and make decisions that make sense based on available information. Such skills include demonstration of the ability to apply logical thinking to gathering and analyzing information, designing and testing solutions to problems, and formulating plans.<br>  <br>  According to the above definition, it sounds like a good quality to have. I don't analyze everything under the sun, that is for sure and often cannot make sense of things based on the information given. I would have to depend on the Holy Spirit to reveal the knowledge and understanding  of some things and if its too complex, I don't try to analyze unless it is something of great interest to me.

ZW0JHvdraa	As the saying goes, “No man is an island, unto himself.”  There have been times in my life that I have had to swallow my pride & ask for help (financially, emotionally, physically, & spiritually); just as there have been many, many times where I have helped others as well.  I do not regret either, as I am not of the opinion that this is a sign of weakness, or dependency.  Rather it is a sign of intelligence & resourcefulness to recognize & reach out when you need help.<br>  <br>  We all need help at one time or another in our lives, whether it is financial, emotional, physical, or spiritual.  I mean, wow, can you imagine how great it must be to get through your entire life without ever needing to ask another human being for help?  Anyone so fortunate needs to drop to his or her knees, and thank Almighty God because they are indeed among the rare few!|`|5FVyVS9vaa	I will go without before asking for anything.|`|jjt2enntaa	i hate asking for help of any kind.  i am always the strong one and people generally come to me for help.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	.........help !

I did not want my parents to know what I was going through. . my mother had cancer and was going for treatments at the time, and I didn't want them worrying about me. . . somehow with the grace of God, I made it through.  Now, whenever someone is having a rough time, I try to help however I can. . . no need to ask. . . I can bake a cake, lend an ear, offer to share my home, or whatever. . . I just wish I was richer because there are so many who need help in these times. . . I was never rich, and I don't think I ever will be, but there are other ways of giving. . even if it is just prayers !!!|`|bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	"Show me the way to go home.

B958U2ctaa	It’s hard to suggest a course of action without knowing the full details, but my first suggestion would have to be leaving the spirit alone. Spirits are all around us, and few of them can harm us. Unless you feel like you are in danger, I'd say just telling it to leave would be sufficient. You have to be firm when you do this. Make it clear that it is YOUR home and they are not welcome.<br>  <br>  If that doesn’t work, another option is burning sage to banish negativity. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the most common is to get a sage smudge stick, light it, and move clockwise around the home with it. The smoke should be waved into all the corners, nooks, crannies, closets, cabinets, and so on. While doing this you can say "Anything not here for the highest and best good of those who live here, be gone. You are not wanted, and you are not welcome. This home has been cleansed and blessed." or something similar. When I smudge I usually say something simple like "This space has been purified and cleansed. Nothing but love and light may enter here." It’s all up to you though.<br>  <br>  I read XxRachelxX’s answer, and I respectfully disagree. I am also a witch that has dealt with spirits quite often, but I think you should avoid spells unless you are experienced with casting and know the possible consequences. I would suggest sticking with simply telling it to leave and burning sage. If that doesn’t work, I’d suggest calling someone in to take care of it. You can call a priest to come bless your home, or if you think a spell is the right choice, you can call an experienced witch to cast it.   <br>  <br>  I do agree with Brooke though, if you are afraid, do not show it. Whether you’re dealing with a spirit in a home or a bully at school, showing fear just allows something to have power over you. Do your best to hide your fear and stand strong. That will probably be your biggest asset in the situation.|`|rg4lS9E9aa	rebuke the devil and he will flee from you. call on the name of Jehovah.|`|atabAdBjaa	I can understand exactly what you are talking about because I've had very similar experiences.

Im only 13 , but i'll tell you what to do. Simply have crosses around yourself. Maybe wear a cross necklace? There are also people who can do prayers and get rid of any evil spirits. But whatever you do, if you ever come in contact with it dont show it your afraid. Thats what they want you to do, they try to take your energy. If you think its around say "In the name of God I command you to leave." In a very strong confident voice.|`|7294c9edbf7c247468b6e48776c6fcadaa	Don't worry about it Ghost don't eat much: <br>  What you have to really worry about is your free loading in-laws eating you out of house and home.|`|9obyO79raa	the prayer is good. also try the ritual ans' above, I also recommend burning white sage & Sandalwood|`|0TTZERJmaa	nah don't do the prayer because if it is a demon it WILL make it angry.<br>  <br>  Try this spell:<br>  <br>  Banish Evil Spell<br>  <br>  sometimes it's not clear what or who needs to be banished. There's just a prevailing sense of evil that needs to be expelled. This spell is most effective during the dark moon. An iron hammer is required , as is a flat rock, and either a coffin nail or an old rusty nail.<br>  <br>  1. Hammer the nail against the rock. The goal is not to pierce the rock but merely to score it three times across the face. Visualise what you are dispelling while you hammer.<br>  <br>  2. Bury the stone far away.<br>  <br>  3. Carry the nail in a red mojo bag, together with some crossroad or graveyard dirt.<br>  <br>  if this doesn't work call a priest to banish and cleanse you home for you.|`|SKJMQGWNaa	the prayer of st gertrude???<br>  fkin hell how much ghost hunters do u watch?!?!<br>  <br>  no prayer will work jus tell it to get lost and quit bein gay

3vt7GhVYaa	If you truly wish to be closer to God and Jesus why would you want anyone else whether it be a guardian angel or the Holy Spirit to finish your prayer?  I mean these two entities you are giving already know the Lord and God so how could it make you closer?  Unless they asked the Lord to grant you enough discipline to to stay awake during your prayer.<br>  <br>  I would say you should go about your prayer in a different way if you really want to get to know the Lord.  This is very important to me because the worst possible thing I could imagine happening to me would be to one day stand before the Lord and hear Him say "I'm sorry,<br>   I don't know you"....    I want Him to see me from accross the way and hear Him say "Hey Dad,  This is the one I was telling you about!" as He summons me to His feet.<br>  <br>  Anyway... When you wake up each morning say good morning to the Lord,  praise God first thing and throughout your day as you see His blessings.  Speak with Him as you go through your day as though your prayer never ends.  At the days end, thank Him for all He does,  pour out your worries and concerns for tomorrow, say Amen and rest assured that He will bless you with a new day.<br>  <br>  In this fashion you will take all things before the Lord as they come to you and your relationship with the Lord will grow to your heart and souls content.  <br>  It is also much easier to "do the right thing" in any situation because you become aware of the Lords pressence in your life.<br>  <br>  God Bless!|`|0YQRbq9faa	Guardian angels do not pray and intercede for us.  Only Christ does.  Guardian angels do just what their name says, they guard you when in grave or mortal danger because it is not your time to die.|`|5shqstYraa	May be on the guardian angel part, but not the trinity part|`|7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	I've never read any Doctrine on that, but it sounds interesting.<br>  <br>  And yes the Bible does mention Angels sent to assist Jesus.|`|frpCK0utaa	I have actually never heard that.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	Yes you do.  You are a child, right?|`|5aDMFGykaa	And then you are saying that we make fun of the christians...<br>  If we hear those things what do you want us to do???|`|YimkX6Tzaa	No. <br>  <br>  Angels do not come FOR the man, angels come TO the man.|`|rU6TR9Teaa	Well, the angels will not finish your prayer for you, just as your brother or sister probably wouldn't finish your chores for you.  It is up to us to seek God in ALL things and to pray always.  <br>  Luke 21:36- "Watch therefore, and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man.” <br>  Also, my friend, Jesus, the Son of God, found it necessary to pray alone through the entire night on several occasions to His Father.  <br>  Luke 6:12- "Now it came to pass in those days that He went out to the mountain to pray, and continued all night in prayer to God."<br>  This not to say that you should pull an all-nighter every single week of the year.  The key is not to be able to physically stay up that late and have enough to say to God for the whole night, but to develop the extremely deep love for God and to desire Him with all your heart.<br>  Therefore, pray and seek Him as your Lover, as your King, as your Friend, and as your God!  Amen!  Hallelujah!|`|s7h8WhMyaa	How would anyone finish it for you? It's your thoughts and feelings, not your angels|`|UinOWcMUaa	No -- you must finish what you begin :)|`|FDsopi1Taa	Actually, if anyone finishes your prayers, it is the Holy Spirit. The Bible  does not speak of Guardian Angels, but says that the Holy Spirit helps us pray as we ought.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Young One,<br>  The "Guardian Angel" is never mentioned in the BIBLE and is never said to do such a thing.

6ec6afa27ccfe7badb1528fec2817bfcaa	it sort of depends on how your mind works. There are two "methods" of learning / teaching a new language: one starts with learning grammar, memorizing declinations and conjugations, then forming small sentences etc. The other one is what we here in Holland call the "natural" method, which is more like how a small kid learns his native language: listening to full sentences and "chunks", and when making mistakes the kid will get corrected: "no hon.. it's not stakkish, it's stair-case!"<br>  I once helped two girls (13 yrs old) with their German homework (natural method). One did great, the other one got very confused and got only bad grades. When I saw she kept looking for grammar constructions that were not explained yet, I had her memorize all the declinations.. problem solved!<br>  When I was in school I learned languages (German, French, English, Latin and Greek) by starting to get the structure of the language and memorize.. and later in life I tried to learn Portuguese by the "natural" method.. and it did not work for me at all!<br>  So.. find out which way works best for you!<br>  And by the way: listening to whole sentences and chunks is good anyway: it helps you to get used to the sound of the language, and once you got the basic grammar you will proceed faster.|`|8c6rwptzaa	improve your french!:<br>  <a href="http://amourparisien.ning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://amourparisien.ning.com/</a><br>  need more members!|`|AA11761261	no,you must learn the function of each word,and their usage in phrases,because a word put into a phrase can have a different meaning then the dictionary form,and you need to learn grammatical function

There are so many directions you could go with this. Honestly 95% of the time there are going to people that you disagree with no matter where you go. If you are lucky enough to find a niche with people who share the same values as you that is the best. If you are quiet about them doing it anger may build up inside and you may burst out one day. Maybe? You could talk to the manager and hope the manager would put an end to it without telling them you were the one who inquired. The manager shouldn't do this. If you find out the manager told the people you said something I would go to the area manager. But then you could just end up getting them upset with you and trying to get you to lose your job. So in the end I would either suggest ignoring it or finding another job working around more mature people.|`|Ev6ruMeNaa	I think you need to let them know that you want to be more apart of the team, put it that way. You should also mabe try talking to them and let them see for a couple of days that your not as bad as they thought and they will come around.

rU6nh42Eaa	Very good question.  Muslim law has always let a woman keep her own property.  If the marriage fails, she gets back everything she brought into the marriage.  Muslim women have a lot more rights than European women did until the last century.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	To be in an Atheist society where she could divorce if she wanted.  Neither Muslim nor Christian were into liking that idea.<br>  <br>  And one of the earliest societies to grant property to women was Sparta.  I wouldn't wanna be a Spartan wife either.  It certainly doesn't make them "moral" or "the one true religion."|`|SrdIsAkTaa	First, that's in 1827 not modern day.<br>  <br>  Second, there is a difference between theory and practice, see Saudi Arabia for a good example.<br>  <br>  Third, Scandinavian women prior to Christianization came along had equal property rights, legal rights, and access to divorce as the men did.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Yes, Islamic law was progressive for its time.<br>  <br>  But then it never changed while the rest of the world did.|`|N8QLKpCMaa	yes, you are right here i told you before that islam has already its civil & criminal law & with out flaws and the things in religion are long term & such admirable that legislation of scholars is to do with extraordinary & weird situations only.<br>  <br>  the same comparison you can see in case of voting, political participation & business as wife of prophet PBUH was doing trade by her workers !<br>  <br>  here woman has numerous rights such as divorce, polygamy ( when 1st quit ), property & etc etc............<br>  <br>  still woman in west is suffering from many other such flaws like rape guilty is only 7 year while islam says to hang the guilty who disrespected woman.|`|E0lMycUeaa	in Europe until the 19th century, women did not have the right to own their own property. When they were married, either it would transfer to the husband or she would not be able to dispense of it without permission of her husband. In Britain, perhaps the first country to give women some property rights, laws were passed in the 1860's known as "Married Women Property Act." More than 1300 years earlier, that right was clearly established in Islamic law.<br>  <br>  "Whatever men earn, they have a share of that and whatever women earn, they have a share in that." [Noble Quran 4:31]|`|7J1D1IyRaa	The simple truth is that women are actually better off in islam than in christianity or judaism--even now--because a Muslim man has to make a life-time committment and pay substantial amount of money to his bride, or at least sign a marriage contract that he would have to pay it, before he can touch her. In the Western system, a guy simply has to ask, have sex, and move on.|`|lh2H5oSOaa	God Almighty being just and All Knowing made that law for women.<br>  <br>  They inherited one half of what their male siblings did. But then they were married at the expense of their fathers. On top of that they were entitled to  'mehar', (marriage money)  from their husband. So they can survive, even if they do not work for a living.<br>  <br>  In Europe and USA, where voice for human rights is raised more forcefully, even today, many women are paid just 50% of their male counterparts. But people still blame Islam, instead of setting their own house right.<br>  <br>                                                     Muhammad Javed Iqbal|`|fmgPKOaraa	and the number of muslim women who lived, got married, and owned property in singapore in 1827 was...?<br>  <br>  judging by where western women are today in comparison to muslim women... i'd say muslim women got the nasty end of the stick...
SE2xiEupaa	In my opinion it will just complicate your relationship and created useless tension. I would tell her how you are feeling, but generally threesomes cause more problems than they fix. Each relationship is unique, but if you truly love this girl I would advise you not to involve a third person in your relationship.|`|BD8O7RR3aa	not to burst your bubble, but this is classic lesbian young love.  firstly, the chances of you marrying her are slim to none if you've been together since you were 15.  and i don't think it's fair to either one of you to just be with to each other until you "get married." you are so YOUNG! if you are wanting to make out with a guy now, that's not just going to go away.   i don't know - in my experience (being almost 30) - I felt the same way when I was 15 with my first love.  I wanted to 'put her in a box' and go experience until I was ready to be with her.  It clearly didn't work out.  Go your separate ways - if you are meant to be together you'll find each other - until then, make sure she really is the one by meeting other people also.  only get to live life once.|`|n2DfXIwcaa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhhJB7UlAOZbOxsKNo9AHYHsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225090001AA31EQ7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8PA58u3kaa	while its true pursuing this idea can cause problems in a relationship, I think just ignoring it and letting the urge nag you for the rest of your life can be even more problematic.

Assure her that nothing has happened behind her back. Maybe you two will decide to find a willing guy for a threesome thereby sharing the new experience and each other simultaneously. Communication is key though, because if you dont' talk about it, then one day you're going to succumb  to the urge and do something behind her back which you may both end up regretting.
fdee9f2f8c3353271f559676ca2a4337aa	I would send a note on a nice card saying how shocked and saddened you were to learn of this, and to say how sorry you are to not have been able to be there to help your friend through this when it happened.<br>  <br>  If you can think of some endearing or some special moment...even an amusing moment to reminisce about regarding the teenager's life, include that.  You can start with "I'll always remember the time...."  Conclude the letter with something personal like "always remember that he/she loved you." or "so glad he/she touched our lives".<br>  <br>  Don't worry about making the pain worse...you can't.  Condolences, by their very definition, mean "going through this pain with you".  Your friend will appreciate that you care.|`|l9lrT7bfaa	I would comfort her but then ask her about him/her. People often make the mistake of thinking that someone who has lost someone does not want to talk about them. Their lost family are still very alive in their memories and they might welcome the opportunity to tell you all about them. I would give it a few days and ring them to invite them out for coffee to have a chat. She will be fragile about her loss but I wouldn't be surprised if she tells you all about them.|`|x7wYpLPvaa	theres really nothing you can do to ease the pain but you can just show that if they need anything like some one to talk to youre there remember sometimes the best thing a person can do its just be there|`|9ZBSOUdhaa	send her one of those grief cards, "thinking of you" in the mail.<br>  <br>  that's so sad :(|`|iZLHDZ4saa	All I can think about is ask them if they want a hug.. If yes than give them one to show you care.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	A simple "I'm sorry to hear that" is enough. Maybe a hug, if you feel so inclined.<br>  <br>  Truth be told, there is nothing that you can say that will make things all better.  Maybe not even anything that can make the pain worse, either.<br>  <br>  Best to be factual.  If your friend wants to talk about it, listen.  Let them unburden themself.  If they don't want to talk about it, go with whatever subject they bring up.<br>  <br>  What hurt me the worst when I lost my son was those who said to me that they'd do anything they could to help. And then, when I brought up the subject of his death, they instantly changed the subject, or else told me they had to leave now.  Left me standing there by myself.  Like, if we talked about it, they might be hurt by it.<br>  <br>  If I brought it up to them that they had promised to help, they said "but I don't know what to say."  So what?  Just listen.  I will give you clues enough to guide you along.

AA12193600	It's quite probable the ark of the covenant never actually existed.  The tablets of the ten commandments were purportedly placed in it--yet it is clear from archeology that there never was a ten plagues of egypt, the hebrews were never in bondage inegypt, there was no exodous, and the hebrews never occupied the "promised land" until about a thousand years after the story.  Further the Moses myth was based on the sumerian king sargon myth--the resemblence of the moses character to the king sargon character is striking (the king sargon character predating moses by a thousand years).  Half of the commandments were from the egyptian book of the dead.  No exodous, no moses, no ten commandments-in reality means the ark was imaginary as well.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	The Ark of the covenant probably existed because it was recorded in the Bible....and the Bible is an excellent history book of the Jews, the old Testament, that is.

I know black people don't like to admit it but when someone of another race or even of the same race is treating us a certain way (negatively) it is because they already have a preconceived notion of who we are and what we are going to do. I know it is frustrating and it is hard but we have to learn to bite our tongues and walk away.

They're just regular people who want to inform people about a topic.<br>  <br>  Before, anyone could just click on the "edit" icon in an article and write whatever they wanted, but recently, they've been more restrictive and you actually have to sign up for membership.

Generally, their policy is to stick with whichever standard, UK or American, is initially used in the article. A lot of people, including me, think the American rule for quotation punctuation is bizarre and ridiculous, and because of this I think wikipedia tends to lean toward UK style in that respect especially. Software people hate it in particular, because we often have to quote exact strings, like "type 'run.'" If you follow the American rule, the period gets stuck inside the quotation marks, and the unwitting user reading the manual types "run." and gets an error message. Dumb, dumb, dumb.<br>  <br>  Also note that if you do go onto a page and start "correcting" UK style with American style, you're likely to get reverted pretty fast.|`|Ofccma3Caa	HAVE YOU NOTICED,<br>  <br>  that all the information found on Wikipedia isn't legit, because usually people like you and I can go in there an modify the information on certain subjects to their best of their knowledge so that information isn't accurate.|`|LnSKQISDaa	It is not wikipedia.

Think about what is being said here in relation to all the Churches that teach the Commandments are "done away" or "nailed to the cross".<br>  Anyone claiming to have a revelation or prophecy that is outside the parameters of the worship that the Almighty has already set is a liar.<br>  <br>  Genesis 26:5  Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.<br>  <br>  Psam 111:10  The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever. <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 12:13  Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man. <br>  <br>  Matthew 5:17   Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.<br>  18  For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.  19  Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.<br>  <br>  Matthew 15:9  But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.....19:17  And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:18  Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.

Although these are vague and not so clearly defined. God from time to time had been calling leaders as shepherds to tend His flocks or believers. At first these shepherds are faithful and zealously obeying God but fame, wealth and success changed their attitudes and behavior. They failed God and follow the desires of their hearts. They failed to accomplish the task given to them by God. And God had set the day to pour out His vengeance upon them. How many spiritual leaders had been exposed already? The New Testaments writers were called by God to record and give accounts of the life and deeds of His Son Jesus. Jesus, HE promised to send to the world to save men from  the torment of hell. So these records are important so men must be aware of His future plans. These would also confirm the prophecies of the Old Testaments prophets. God also promised the pouring out of latter rains meaning He will be calling more people to confirm Old Testaments prophecies and exploring New Testaments writers. The latter messengers will be more precise and clear because they have more records to base upon their confirmations. God will be showing to them things to come now through the Holy Spirit. The small, tender voice that a man or woman of God would hear from time to time. Even God will be revealing to them His will through dreams and vision. Joel 2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions.|`|8lMrfgDxaa	If you want the answers for now, don't turn to the Catholic and Mormon churches for it.

He wanted to show us how we should live, because the Prophets didn't do enough of a good job.|`|093b368d01bbdc03231061bf6fc4d520aa	God has always revealed His will through His prophets.  In Old Testament times His Prophets, particularly Moses, recorded the revelations they received and that became scripture to guide His people.  In New Testament times Jesus spoke for God the Father and His disciples recorded His teachings.  That also became scripture but it was meant to eventually guide all mankind.<br>  <br>  I believe that there is a prophet on the earth today who receives revelation from God to guide and direct His church.<br>  <br>  In James 1:5-6 It states:<br>  If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.<br>  <br>  But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.<br>  <br>  What this means to me is that anyone can receive revelation for themselves or whatever God has given them stewardship over if they ask in faith with nothing wavering.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	God's official divine revelation ended with the death of the last apostle.<br>  <br>  In terms of authority, the New Testament outranks the Old, simply because the New Testament is the eternal fulfillment of the old, in the person of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  In the Book of Acts, St. Peter explains that God will continue to reveal things to his people until the end of time, but since personal/private revelations of that type have proven notoriously hard to document, and have often proved to be fraudulent or incorrect, the Church requires no one to accept them on faith.<br>  <br>  Please do not attempt to correlate Catholic beliefs and practices with Mormon ones.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church continues to act in the name of Jesus Christ, precisely as God revealed him in his person, and in his incarnate and literal Word.<br>  <br>  Mormons claim a strange christ who cannot be the God of Christianity.|`|AA10202389	We have an advantage today from the days of King James in that the average person can look at the Greek to help understand a scripture. You can't always just take the meaning off the top of your head, as the Bible goes way past Quantum Physics and is compatible with any discoveries and helping us make them. Of course some people don't study it enough to know that wonderment. So all of it is guide forever.<br>  The part we need is about loving God and each other. The problem isn't what part, as the idea is throughout the Bible and we know to love today. The problem is, when are we going to do it. We have plenty of words by now. <br>  On current revelations, any idea that is new to us is a personal revelation, but scripture says to try them to see if they are from God. We have to rate the idea we hear today, and we need the spirit of truth to decide what to believe. I guess you could say that our personal revelations of what's true and what's not, is the most important for us to make right decisions for now, but the past has our lessons to help us test our insights. <br>  It's also about understanding how the brain works, so we are using it right and applying the laws, lawfully. The brain uses vision logic and who can't visualize a tree. Near the surface of consciousness are the images that the thought was interpreted from, so dreams and visions, we might call them visualizations today, tell us about the conclusions of the subconscious. We are told that some of them are from God. If so, they would be true and can be tested for truth. There are a lot of ways to do that. Try them out, test them against scriptures, logic, experience and any way we can find. <br>  Bible revelations are more general and are more relevant to more people. I guess you could say the new testament information on how to use the mind would be the most important now and it's basically  testing by scriptures and any means possible, also by the scientific method.<br>  The Bible condenses the big picture, so it can't fill in all the details in a thousand pages and we shouldn't expect it to, but it's all valuable. Today we still don't seem to have come far from the wars of ancient times and yet we have some deep and complex questions also. I can't see where we could determine which is more useful. How would you tie down the answer. You could say love is the part we need most or the part of love that we don't get. The part we need most is the part where we actually start doing it. We seem to have the words and not the will.|`|faaaae350fa538cbe00662ece275b4c2aa	If God has a message for our day I want to hear it.  I expect if it is true it will clarify and enhance previous teaching.  If it is different from earlier revelation it should be part of a higher law like when Jesus commented on the laws of Moses.  <br>  <br>  I can have revelation because of a Prophet.  I can have personal revelation, as well.<br>  <br>  1 Kings 19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the Lord. And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord; but the Lord was not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the Lord was not in the earthquake: <br>    12 And after the earthquake a fire; but the Lord was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.

3XLAs6Isaa	Well, first of all, Judaism never says to "stone non-believers" anywhere. In fact, in Judaism, non-Jews can still have a place in the World to Come (basically heaven). Judaism judges people by their actions, not by their faith (one of the biggest differences between it and other religions).<br>  <br>  Anyway, in Judaism, all commandments (all 613 of them) stand on their own, and they are all essential. One cannot pick and choose which commandments to follow, and which to ignore. That is an insult to G-d.<br>  As far as I know, Christianity values the 10 Commandments and the Golden rule? Although, Christians do not keep Shabbat (one of the 10 commandments), and they certainly have a strange version of the "one" G-d...("the son and the holy ghost"?)|`|l1ctIW7eaa	well supposedly the golden rule is most important for Christianity...but most of them don't follow it very well|`|UinOWcMUaa	LOVE God with all your heart, mind and soul -- and LOVE other's the same :) And also the 10 commandments --|`|WjRqYf6naa	Mat 22:35-40  And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him.

zZxX5PXBaa	Hi, Batty,<br>  <br>  I'm guessing it is related to 'charming' ... and maybe the writer has made up an informal form, or maybe there's a little local dialect that's evolved in a small social group (you can get very localised dialects, like one suburb of a city). My guess is that the writer is playing with the french word 'charmant', which would sound in a French pronunciation more like 'sharmon'. It's not so unusual in Europe at least (do you know where the writer is from?) to play around with words from other languages. There's even a sort of hybrid language 'Franglais', made up of French and English; it's not a real language, and it's often use in a playful way, but it does also work a bit like a pidgin language for people travelling between the countries.<br>  <br>  So, my guess is it's from charming / charmant, and it's a semi-comic word that at best is only used among a small group of people. I suspect though that it would be understood by a lot of French or English people, especially if someone spoke it and did it with mock French accent.<br>  <br>  Having said all that, the possibliity that other users have mentioned, that someone chose it as a nick on some website makes sense. Then perhaps they mistakenly entered it in a box meant for the title of the review?|`|gZ0NPuleaa	No such word .

onkUcy19aa	I agree.<br>  <br>  Spirituality is far more encompassing than religion, though we often see the two used interchangeably. Studies have found this state of transcendence, beyond the material and self (Thiabault, 1991) or spirituality positively correlated with morale, health and happiness. National initiatives such as the National Interfaith Coalition of Aging and facets of the White House Conferences on Aging have ignited interest and programs within the formal religious communities and other nonprofit entities.  <br>  While we understand that older adults may turn to religion more over time to help them cope or adapt, the church often becomes less accessible in their time of need. Different individuals within cultures have differing philosophies and practices of spirituality, but derive similar positive outcomes.  <br>  <br>  Losses and life changes increase in later life and challenge older adults. Instilling hope, offering supports and therapeutic interventions such as prayer, meditation, artistic expression or professional referrals may lead to spiritual renewal and healing.

And Americans do it better. <br>  Have you seen "Zeitgeist: Addendum" yet: It's a must see and free on Google. I would download it while it's still available, as I don't think some want us working together.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=..." rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  On average a word has six or seven definitions and probably unlimited meanings depending on the words used with it. If a medicine man puts a curse on you and you believe in it, you can die from fright. If you don't believe he has the power, you can still believe that people can die from fear of the power. You give him the power by your belief. The Bible doesn't ask us to believe without premises, facts and experiences. That would be nuts. Belief can kill you, the nocebo affect, or give you life, the placebo affect. If you believe something that's untrue, even the emotions behind the thought can affect your health and well being. To have absolute belief you need an absolute to believe in, for even better health. Even truth is not that reliable. The mind checks reality 24 times a second. In that sense, we can believe in non-belief better. Scriptures wouldn't argue with that either. When you get that, you don't have to feel threaten too much and you can't be manipulated for too long either. With absolute belief you can even stand against the world. Leaders do it all the time. That can be bad if you don't check yourself 24 times a second. lol I guess if you think a book says something stupid when it doesn't, that may reflect more on you than the book. Isn't it sad we follow Aquinas. From what I hear, he must have been stupid. That would be the problem with religion then. Stupid people following other stupid people. I imagine Atheism has the same problem.|`|AA11647647	People do this for everything. They will fight to prove their team, country, political views, and social views are the best or right when in actuality they are making them appear worse. It is an unfortunate part of human nature. I am sure you have something you get angry with people for disagreeing with. I just wonder what ever happened to live and let live.|`|WL7nKDplaa	I agree. I would never try to push my beliefs on anyone. Also, no one knows for sure, so how can we say one religion is "the one"? Good question! If everyone thought like you, the world would be a happier place.|`|O9omaIDAaa	By the time I got to the end, I had forgotten the question.|`|b63saJCqaa	we are warning you because we are sure of our beliefs<br>  you need to know the risks of denying God|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	some people only like to argue, and religion is a good subject to argue about.|`|BDPc9P4Faa	I was wondering the same exact thing. Yes the Atheists and Christians here are horrible.|`|FhHklqkhaa	I do think that many believers hide their bigotry under the attitude that it's beliefs that shouldn't be challenged<br>  organizations and websites are there for people who share similar views or to seek more info I think<br>  many people with sacred texts or books relies on them to provide answers, when that's challenged they  get very defensive and offensive as you are challenging their world-view<br>  sometimes some 'opinions' whilst untrue can still be very hurtful<br>  human society also has various laws - some are based on religion and they discriminate and people can't ignore that, some believers/bigots also want the hatred, lies ad discrimination  to stay forever and only have selected people be equal|`|pYomxgYfaa	I totally agree with you. If people are so sure of themselves, they don't have to defend themselves so violently. <br>  <br>  I don't know why people are like that. I find that atheists are more open-minded and accepting of other beliefs than most religious people are. All they do is call us "lost souls" and throw nasty comments our way. <br>  <br>  It just shows you how ignorant people can be, and it makes religion and faith look really bad. Maybe that's why Atheism is growing in numbers...|`|olI0pOQCaa	It's human nature to defend what you believe in.<br>  <br>  By asking this question, you're enabling an argument, so you have an immediate contradiction in your little rant.|`|uQHHVI8Zaa	i ALWAYS think that !!<br>  <br>  im a Christian, and when people put merry X-mas or X-mas tree, im always thinking "why not just keep Christ in there?'" if u dont believe bout that stuff then yeahh, just let it be. i totally agree. and yeah, it IS proven there's a God, Jesus Christ... there's been artifacts and ancient scrolls that led to the Scriptures of Jesus Christ. AND in the time the Bible says He WAS on earth. there is a God, and its Christ.|`|jIR2ljSZaa	if that's the way you feel then why are you here bothering up with it?? you should keep it to yourself going by what you said. how are you gonna find like minded people if you don't talk to anyone and express your opinion????|`|LCZChP7Maa	I like to have Bible discussions, where I state my beliefs and provide scriptural proof for my beliefs.

An atheist section needs to be made.|`|a9r82MRIaa	everything is not set in stone|`|VhtyM9Bpaa	You won't see atheists pushing their ways on anyone.  All we ask is that religions show us the same respect.<br>  <br>  They refuse to do so, so we will continue to prove why they are wrong.<br>  <br>  An example?  Why in my town in South Carolina, can I not open my business until 1pm on a Sunday?  I'm not a Christian.<br>  <br>  Why can I not buy or sell alcohol on a Sunday?  Again, I am not a Christian.<br>  <br>  These are two small examples, that Christians can't seem to comprehend.  Not everyone is a Christian.  And until they learn to leave us well enough alone, they are calling down the thunder.<br>  <br>  And we WILL put an end to their cult.  Non-belief in this country is growing exponentially.  More and more people are tiring of the Christian theocracy that has nearly brought this country to ruin.  Christians need to climb back into their holes... or they're gonna get stomped on.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	And let me get this straight : YOU ARE SO SURE OF YOUR BELIEF :) <br>  <br>  Isn't that the problem, that skepticism always thinks it has the answer ?<br>  <br>  ===============<br>  Man can be compelled to do a good many things. There are a good many other things he can do in a halfhearted fashion, as it were, against his will. But belief can never be halfhearted. One can believe only if one wishes to. Perhap the credibility of a given person will be revealed to me so persuasively that I cannot help but think: It is wrong not to believe him; I “must” believe him. But this last step can be taken only in complete freedom, and that means that it can also not be taken. There may be plenty of compelling arguments for a man’s cedibility; but no argument can force us to believe him.<br>  <br>  The unanimity of statements on this point is astonishing; and the agreement ranges all the way from Augustine and Thomas to Kierkegaard, Newman and Andre Gide. Augustine’s phrase from the Commentary on John is famous; “Nemo credit nisi volens”: No one believes except of his own free will. Kierkegaard says that one man can do much for another, “but give him belief, he cannot”. Newman is forever stressing, in one guise or another, the one idea that belief is something other than the result of a logical process; it is precisely not “a conclusion from premises”. “For directly you have a conviction that you ought to believe, reason has done its part, and what is wanted for faith is, not proof, but will.” And Andre Gide? In the last jottings he published after his Journals we may read these sentences: “There is more light in Christ’s words than in any other human word. This is not enough, it seems, to be a Christian: in addition, one must believe. Well, I do not believe.” Taken all together, these statements obviously mean the following: It is one thing to regard what someone else has said as interesting, clever, important, magnificent, the product of genius or absolutely “true”. We may feel compelled to to think and say any and all these things in utter sincerity. But it is quite a different matter to accept precisely the same statements in the way of belief. In order for this other matter, belief, to come about, a further step is necessary. A free assent of will must be performed. Belief rests upon volition” (Josef Pieper, Faith, Hope, Love, p 35-36).|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Only people who live in protected (read "secular") societies think letting anyone believe whatever they want is reasonable. This sounds egalitarian, but can't be justified. Faith flew planes into buildings, accepting it without criticism is suicidal.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	The EGO plays an important role in every man. It will always try to look for reasons or ways to discredit anyone who fails agree with him that he is in the right or good place.<br>  Ever noticed why fraternities often clash with one another? These are group of students who are supposed to be above average in their academic curriculum before they are accepted to join. And yet looking at a rival fraternity, they go down to the animal level of uneducated primates who go to the extent of sometimes killing one another.<br>  In same manner as those who belong to religious group where the teachings should make them "holy" but when confronted by another group of belief, loses their mind to stay on what is right and just for everyone.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Because there seems to be a surge in some wanting things to turn into a theocratic society. I will speak out against that sort of travesty until it is no longer a threat. Which could take a while. There is always need for debate when there are groups of people believing in such bizarre things as invisible sky people and wanting to make laws based on "commandments" of said enigmas in order to impose their dogma upon the masses. Indeed, live and let live. That is called separation of church and state. And it's talked about a lot but it isn't put into practice.|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	"Like seeing children fight."  You're so right.  It gets pretty inane, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  It's true that the people who tend to react the strongest to (perceived) opposition are the ones that are least sure about their beliefs.  The more sure a believer is about what he believes, the more rational and less defensive he will be.<br>  <br>  Of course calling people "stupid" and lacing your remarks with exclamation points sort of indicates some defensiveness too, so ...

7cjn2u9uaa	It's funny how they duck and dodge the question. You are right, atheism is a choice they made based on what they believe to be evidence or lack of.

Athiests don't believe in the supernatural.  They don't subvert their own freedom or dignity without a reason.  If you're going to start worshiping something, or encourage innocent children to do so, then you better have a GOOD reason.  It's all consistent.  <br>  <br>  You can try to make athiesm into a belief if that's the only way you can understand it, but you would be wrong.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Only a Christian would think this up.

No matter in what manner the Name of God and Jesus is preached God is pleased. Any way He looks at our hearts and reads our minds. If even our leaders failed to do the task assigned to them but as long as we believers has personal attachment with Him, He approves of us. In other words personal relationship with God matter most even in any group or religion. If we love God He will love us. If we obey Him we will receive reward from Him. And if we truly love God we also love our neighbors. So this is true religion. James 1:27 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.|`|AA11616515	You are correct<br>  Religion is what man thinks of God; it’s cruel and enslaves people. Pure Christianity w/o the religious aspects is a relationship of a Father with his sons/daughters|`|AA11124121	if not religion..we'd have a Hitler or Stalin .. to lead us.<br>  or worse.|`|SC7sxZDMaa	Religion is not only unnecessary, it's dangerous. Most of them are ancient and archaic and thus outdated. They do not apply to modern society, but rather to ignorant, illiterate nomads, shepherds, and fishermen (the Judeo-Christian religions anyhow) who lived a few thousand years ago. Religion may have had survival value in the past and it may offer some people comfort, but in modern life I think it is an impediment to progress - intellectual, scientific and social progress. And any "newer" religions fare no better, such as the Mormon Church and Scientology.|`|onkUcy19aa	Yes, religion is necessary for morality, democracy and justice. Here is another opinion on the matter:<br>  <br>   One common complaint about secularism is that religion and belief in God are prerequisites for morality, justice, and a democratic society. The basic premise here is that the only values which ultimately matter are those which are transcendent, and such values can only be perceived and understood through religious tradition and a connection with the divine. <br>  <br>  It is strange that such a belief would be as common as it is, because religions and various types of theism have had literally thousands of years during which they could demonstrate that they could provide the basis for a just, moral, and democratic society. For the most part, they haven't done a very good job; on the contrary, religion is too often associated with immorality, injustice, and political repression <br>  <br>  Although these failures do not prove that religion cannot help provide a basis for morality, justice and democracy, they do prove that such values do not naturally and immediately flow from religion - an important point which should discourage people from actively believing in the necessary connection between those values and either religion generally or their religion in particular. <br>  <br>  Is Religion Necessary for Morality?<br>  Is morality dependent upon the existence of any gods? There is no clear reason why we should believe such a thing. If we assume the existence of a god, even a god who has many of the traditional qualities of classical, philosophical theism, there are no particular moral values which we can derive from that premise. <br>  <br>  Is Religion Necessary for Democracy?<br>  Is democracy dependent upon religious beliefs, and specifically Judaism or Christianity? Many Americans appear to believe this very sincerely, but the logic and evidence for it is scanty at best. The best argument offered in favor of it is the idea that these religions teach that all humans are "brothers" and equal in the eyes of God. This, then, is supposed to lead us to the conclusion that we should also be brothers and equal in the eyes of the government, meaning a democratic and just state. <br>  <br>  Are Humans Unable to Establish Morality & Democracy?<br>  One of the principle arguments used in support of the idea that things like morality and democracy should be based upon God and religion is that these provide reliable sources of transcendental, absolute, and eternal values. Basing morality and democracy on humans, however, is a risky affair because of the relative and temporary nature of our own values.|`|xnd99EX4aa	Some people would rather go through life believing in God and then die to find out there is none rather than go through life not believing in God and then die to find out there is. If you are so sure about your belief then you have a right to your belief. So does everyone else. Some people believe that the greatest con the devil ever pulled is convincing people that God doesn't exist.<br>  May God Bless You.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	Religion is a body of teaching about what man must do to please God.<br>  Faith is about a relationship with God.<br>  <br>  Christianity can be either.  But given the question, we can do nicely without religion.  But we cannot exist, find fulfillment and joy without God.  So faith, love and hope are essential...not religion.|`|fM7yNf8oaa	I don't think it is.

I think that diversity in society can be useful, just like diversity in genes are useful.  If there are many different beliefs, then it makes for a more flexible society, capable of responding to external pressure.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I do. I think it advances us as a culture. If everyone believes that women shouldn't have the right to vote, it stays that way forever. It's only through the exchange of ideas that we come to agree on the right ones. There are many people who would argue that people try to impose their values by force, which certainly happens, but I think for the most part that it causes people to evolve for the better.|`|DZ9ADg7Xaa	Diverse cultures are interesting, but diverse beliefs kind of... well I guess beliefs define a culture so this is a tough question. I totally love culture, but hate religion. Opposing beliefs often cause bitterness between various groups and people. Maybe if people more open-minded it'd be cool. But many aren't.

The longer answers take time to actually think and type. So many aren't willing to answer. I am sorry this is how many are, but not all of us are like that.

I guess if you really want a serious answer, post your question on multiple sites, so you can sift through the junk answers and maybe find the gem you're after.
2RWayH3Oaa	When she teases you and makes sexual jokes or advancements toward you, play along and tell her ooohh are you hitting on me lean forward and give her a kiss.  Pay closely to how she reacts. If she does not push you away, go for it because it sounds like maybe she is bi-curious.  If she pushes you away, then have a talk with her and tell her how you feel.|`|b6bAqHpUaa	I think you should tell her all this. Tell her that if she doesn't want to be more than friends with you that you would be more comfortable if she didn't flirt with you and say stuff like that. Tell her that it hurts you. <br>  If she already knows you like her and is still your friend and totally cool about it than she really shouldn't have a problem with this.|`|38jhKQU4aa	Flirt back. Go with the flow of life...if you've already told her you like her she should make the next move. She seems curious to me if she's flirting with you and teasing you.

I was in sort of the same situation with another girl, and she knew about it. With the teasing though, she took it to the next level and we made out and stuff. It hurt so bad when it was just fun for her, and she just wanted to be friends. The "just friends" part was really difficult, I'm sure you can relate, because as much as you want a friendship, you still really want something more. I think if you just tell her how painful it is when she jokes and teases you, then she will understand. If you both are committed to being friends, then friends you will be. It will be hard, but eventually you will move on.<br>  So bottom line, talk to her, make sure she knows and understands how you feel. Things should work out.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	Tell her not to do it because it makes you uncomfortable. and then move in for a kiss on a web cam and send it to me. lol jk

Ofccma3Caa	It's associated with Spanish mainly. Because some people in Mexico (usually, or other Spanish speaking countries) use the term "Gringo" to describe an American(U.S Citizen) , especially someone who is white with blond hair or that can easily be recognized as American(United States citizen).

I've seen it first hand.|`|FJHf16REaa	cause they are ******** and dont realize the reason they banned pot was to scapegoat the mexicans that were rapidly immigrating to our country and african americans during the depressionnn and we used them before for cheap labor but now our own people didnt have jobs and we needed to deport them or jail them|`|27hANXS4aa	You sure it doesn't kill brain cells?|`|dhsvBjmdaa	i agree... marijuana actually helped me stop drinking!! lol|`|VCzsfVM5aa	Only reason marijuana is considered a gateway drug is first of all, it is illegal, and we learn all about how bad drugs are for us.  But then when you experiment with it, and like it, your morals go down and you convince yourself that maybe other drugs won't be so bad.  Marijuana is the victim of bad publicity.  I would say alcohol is a worse gateway drug as it innebriates you to the point you'd end up doing a line of coke off a hookers butt.|`|IzhKZfsMaa	Your logic is as flawed as your grammar.

7J9Eb3VCaa	I've gotten stuck in the routine of doing a lot of things. For example my diet use to be really good and healthy. These past two weeks for some reason I've been craving sweets every night which is totally not like me I don't like sweets. To get back into a healthy routine I have to have strong will power and that's hard to get. To get that I set a goal and a thought to think about whenever I get the urge. Like my hawaii trip coming up, or a picture of a pretty girl I've seen. I guess it all depends on what your habit is. If you can distract yourself for at least 21 days you won't have to worry about it anymore. It takes 21 days to break a habit. I'm not sure how big or little, how annoying or not your habit is but just learning to hurry and think of something important really fast works. Or before you start your day you can make a list of your normal routine and exclude the thing you aren't supposed to do and just follow the list.|`|IzhKZfsMaa	I can only do one thing at a time.

f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	many people have forgotten (or taken for granted) that our civilization is built on science and scientific theories.  premature babies are saved due to science, the luxuries many of us enjoy are based on hard science.<br>  <br>  we can never know what is going to benefit us unless we EXPLORE the universe from the largest galaxy to the smallest subatomic particle.<br>  <br>  i believe scientists are partly to blame (i'm going for a chemistry degree btw).  Scientists have to be able to educate the public on what they are doing and why they are doing it.  the public will not fund science they do not understand and people fear/don't like what they don't understand.  just look at the number of people who think the LHC will destroy the earth.  Scientists should be honored like sports stars are (heck they do more to benefit society than sports stars) but if the public cannot understand what it is they are paying for, they will always look down on new scientific endeavors.|`|hQDapmICaa	I loved Science!

They summarily exclude any possibilty of a deity when such an assertion cannot be proved or disproved. Consensus does not always equal truth which has been demonstrated in science time and again. One of the quirks of science is that any theory (like evolution) may be acceptable to most scientists on a provisional basis even if there are a number of glaring contradictory evidences until a new theory comes along which can explain all the evidence. If scientist's are unwilling to admit this is the case but deceptively go on claiming that evolution is the only factual, viable explanation of life on earth then it's understandable that some people treat them with more than a little reservation.<br>  <br>  "The greatest obstacle to progress in science is the illusion of knowledge"<br>  <br>  Prof. William B.

I find neither boring -- though my Physics teacher is very dull and monotone. My AP Bio class would far surpass any of my other classes except for the fact that I want to understand every little detail about it and there's not nearly enough time in the day to do so (I actually have a two hour exam on it tomorrow and I should be studying right now). They are both important -- Physics has common applications to many things in daily life, and Biology covers many useful things to know. I do not believe that scientists deserve to be treated poorly because they are only seeking the truth.<br>  <br>  Not to mention, I think that anybody who is religious should be well-informed in science first.|`|TjKYYunTaa	To be honest, and not to bash religion , but Science has been proven or we wouldn't have all these fancy electronics, or be able to keep things in space or what have you. but I believe the religion is basically in the same boat trying to grab on to something that may or may not be there, and in the end who's gonna know? science will prove its self one day new things are coming about every day. but due to the vast popularity of religion they try to keep it on the back burner and say that believing in it is bad.. well for those who dont believe in religion as much as science, how are you to kno that something soooo long ago actually happend? that the man on the cross was real?  people dont realize that believing in science isnt JUST about believe in the bang theory, your not hailing to a new god. your trying to explain the unknown and explore how everything works. religion just seems so hypocritical these days if u believe in one faith ur hated by the other, but if u believe in science almost all religions hate you... thats the only thing religions really have going for them is they believe in a superior being or beings. Science should be explored to its fullest , if they find something GREAT if not o well its not like your giving ur life up to believing in something that isng real.|`|orWh2mG6aa	I found grade nine and ten science boring. But I do like Grade 11 Biology because you learn about the human body and how it functions (i want to be a nurse) but Chemistry is stupid and ridiculously school (and i have to do it again in summer school *not happy*). I do think science is important depending on what you want to do in life. Scientists do not deserve to be treated with suspicion and frequent hate. <br>  <br>  I think that it's stupid that people still think that the earth is only 6000 years old. The earth is 4.6 billion years old. Scientists have proved it. It you don't like it, get over it. But its the truth. <br>  <br>  Even Albert Einstein said:<br>  <br>  "Science without Religion is lame, Religion without Science is blind"<br>  <br>  How do you think they "found pieces of the cross" if they didn't have the science to carbon date the wood (or whatever they need to do)?<br>  <br>  That's my opinion though.|`|xo4iux9gaa	If you are part of the atheistic  science 'hate group' that goes around mocking Christians I'd advise you to spare us all please.....<br>  <br>  that type of intolerance isn't acceptabble to mosty of us.|`|IKyITYICaa	You're not the only one.  It pisses me off that people ignore science and cling to erroneous beliefs simply because it's too much work to use their brains and think critically.  In one of the most important decisions in their life (what to believe in), they fail to use logic to come up with a reasonable worldview.  Instead, they simply go with whatever has been taught to them by their parents or church.  Sad.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Our education system is failing.  Science is no longer emphasized.  Our culture portrays scientists as antisocial nerds.  Is it really surprising people don't like science?<br>  <br>  Combine this with the determined effort of a very vocal and powerful minority to outright destroy science through misinformation and you get the sorry state we are in.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it would be a good idea to remind everyone that science is the only reason the West, its ideals, and culture currently dominate the world.<br>  <br>  And we are losing that advantage.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I never liked science until I took an entomology class this quarter. Biology was okay in high school, but I didn't like it that much. I can't even handle chemistry because it makes absolutely no sense to me.<br>  <br>  Science is extremely important to me, but I just don't understand it all that much.<br>  <br>  Scientists should be hailed as the pioneers that they are.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Science is good when it is being truthful --|`|AA11232725	I know how broadband works and I have the greatest respect for honest science. What I don't respect is pseudo-science where people who call themselves scientists take preconceived notions and try to fit evidence into those notions while discounting evidence that proves problematical to what they want to believe.<br>  <br>  Scientists do a great job in most instances when it comes to practical every day science that can be tested and demonstrated to be true with practical applications.<br>  <br>  They often do a deplorable job when it comes to making their best scientific guesses about what happened in the past in regards to how the universe came into existence, how stars and galaxies were formed, how the planets in our solar system came to be here, how life came to be on this planet in the first place, and how the life that we see today on this planet reached it's current state.<br>  <br>  I could give you example after example of how current theories are elevated to the position of accepted truth when there are major problems with them. <br>  <br>  Life coming from inanimate matter arranged by chance? Complex information (DNA) that far exceeds our most sophisticated computer codes arising from natural forces? Gas clouds condensing into stars when the dissipation force exceeds the gravitational attraction by a ratio of 60 to 1? The sun having 99% of the matter in our solar system but only 1% of the angular velocity compared to the planets?<br>  <br>  Those are just a few. I don't "shut off" science. What I do is use the methods that I was trained in to evaluate science to see if the conclusions are valid or suppositional. I can describe the functioning of electronic circuits from the atomic level on up. In electronics as in all commercial scientific applications you don't get to "just guess". Either it works or it doesn't work and the guesses about past events postulated by current scientific theories "don't work" for the most part.

gAOAdOHraa	I think you are lucky on YA to get that response, some people just do a smiley face or a ...!   They only thing I could come up with is that people are embarrassed by their question.  They are confident when they are asking the question and then a few days later when they choose a best answer, they probably look over the question and ask themselves why they asked it in the first place.  Maybe they don't think that the person who answered would really want a long thank you anyway.  Sometimes I want to write more to thank a person for their answer and then have second thoughts because I think that they may not care for a long response.  I think people today simply don't want to interfere in the business of other people as sad as that sounds.  I guess its like men that still hold doors open for women and get and ear full in doing so.  Maybe people think that if they helped the girl with her books she may not appreciate the gesture.  I had a coffee and a muffin with my dad the other day and when we were finished he stacked the plates and mugs and took them back to the coffee shop staff so they didn't have to do it.

I've had some great apprecaition from people when they choose my answer such as "Thanks, I'll try that right away!" or "I never thought of it that way!"  I honestly look at it as quality over quantity.<br>  <br>  Yes courtesy has gone.  I wonder this consistently and regularly ask myself why chivalry and courtesy is dead. A lot of it has to do with parents not educating courtesy in their children.  I also find that a lot of people are spoiled nowadays.  The girl with the dropped books event is only one in numerous ones that I see on a regular basis as follows:<br>  - old person having trouble carrying something to their car<br>  - people having carrying stuff having trouble opening a door.<br>  - person on the side of the road w/ a flat tire or lots of smoke coming from underneath the hood<br>  - people saying they can't find a quarter for the parking meter / shopping cart<br>  The list goes on.  Common courtesy should be called "Uncommon courtesy".  I'm not being a pessimist but a realist in this situation.   <br>  <br>  TV, radio, media - all of that encourages this behaviour.  Look at Survivor, where you are encouraged to make allegiances and then break them.  You're also encouraged to say crappy things about people behind their backs.  I don't hate too many things (because it requires too much effort) but I loathe this show on so many levels.<br>  <br>  There are other things I could mention, such as being able to be jerks because people can hide behind a computer.  Maybe this is why I try and do more considerate things randomly on a regular basis.<br>  Hope that helped.|`|9ZBSOUdhaa	Yes, I think that common courtesy has gone down in recent years. I think with all the benefits that modern technology brings, it also brings self-centered behavior and lack of concern for other people.  Kids are not having as many face to face relationships - most communication is done via email, text and instant message where it is much easier to say what ever you want, because you don't actually see the other person, and it's kind of like you're not really talking to a real person on the other end.  That's just my theory - with the dawn of technolgy, people are in their own little bubble more than before - even though they are connected to the world.<br>  <br>  i think this attitude extends to other areas of like - such as the example you gave of nobody picking up that girl's books.  I wouldn't be surprised if they ddn't realize she dropped them because they were listening to their ipods. it's just a lack of consideration really.|`|x7wYpLPvaa	b/c there taking everything nice for granted you shouldnt feel fustrated over the lack of courtesy of others just do your thing and dont change b/c of them there are other pple who actually appreciate others nice nature|`|LWZ4JZRiaa	its the parents fault as much as its the youths fault. if the parents had taught them to stop and pick up the stuff then they would have. but at the same time alot of people in society today are selfish people and dont care about anyone but themselves.|`|e5FoLh2Paa	Look here Sunshine---grow up.

That's 17.5 million births in addition to the present birth rate.<br>  <br>  Let's forget for a moment that the US yearly birthrate is under a Half a million, ad an exponent to that and we would have massive over populations problems inside of a decade.<br>  <br>  <br>  Please check your statistics.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I'm a bit confused. So you're against abortion but all for execution?  So murder is fine as long as it's called Execution? <br>  <br>  An eye for an eye and the world goes blind. <br>  <br>  When abortions were unsafe and illegal large numbers of women and infants were dying world wide. Banning abortion will not stop abortions, it will only put women in danger of harming or killing themselves. And unwanted infants at risk of infanticide.|`|JUviY9hoaa	They do think of the children. Hence the abortion. Do you think its right for someone who KNOWS they can not provide for a child or give the child the sort of life he or she deserves to go ahead and give birth?<br>  <br>  You can argue the adoption, but think about all the children in foster care and homes at the moment who need homes. Why would you want to add to the number of un-loved children in the world. <br>  <br>  Or what about a woman who is raped and becomes pregnant? If she went through with the pregnancy and keeping the baby, I can only imagine the resentment she would have for this baby. Children feel things like this, and it affects them later in life. Sometimes so greatly they wind up doing bad bad things. <br>  <br>  Think about it carefully. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying every woman should act like a ho and use abortion as a contraception. That, in my opinion is wrong. But accidents, rapes, medical conditions...sometimes there is a need.|`|Z4avhg3eaa	What do you mean, "innocent?"  Doesn't the Bible say, "all have sinned, and fall short of the glory of God?"<br>  <br>  How is it that fetuses get a free pass for purposes of protesting abortion?  Either all are guilty or not all are guilty.  If they are human from conception, then you lie by calling them "innocent" babies, and are doing so out of an attempt at manipulating people's emotions.|`|9m2LvlWdaa	Yeah. Don't kill fetuses but it's ok to murder civilian adults in other countries. Mmhmm.|`|snj9zznvaa	Wow that is really narrow minded view|`|1CgCx1E2aa	They're not babies yet until they're born. Our bodies can harm eggs, damage eggs, and some people have miscarriages and they're not considered killing a baby they're just considered it didn't work out. Well I know that people that go into get an abortion have to be all legal and there are certain aspects they have to follow. It is very strict. Sometimes it doesn't work out to get pregnant or have a baby. Some people were raped, or didn't use enough protection. There are many reasons for people to get abortions. and when darwin said survival of the fittest, he meant the best apt to survive. Meaning if polar bears were placed in the ocean, they wouldn't be fit and would die. He didn't propose purposely killing, he just meant that the fittest and the best suited creatures to roam an area would survive|`|OiAl6w48aa	Waiting for a source on that number to start with.<br>  <br>  Second, they are NOT babies.  Slight difference.  Plus its covered by the Constitution.  You don't like it, you're free to move.  Iran has a wonderful theocracy you might enjoy.<br>  <br>  Edit: and what's this "God doesn't kill babies" nonsense?  What about natural miscarriages?  What about children who die from any of the variety of childhood illnesses?  Who is responsible for those?|`|ATsdSM7saa	HOSEA 13:16<br>  PSALMS 137:9<br>  <br>  Just a couple examples of how much God loves him some good ole' fashioned infanticide|`|tW86bOMNaa	'Your Darwin'?<br>  <br>  Hardly, he's *everyone's* Darwin... that's the nice thing about Darwin!|`|XDvOwLlNaa	if a fetus is never born then it never dies i guess, they arent really members of society either|`|BABcrdMKaa	big mouth la da da da da|`|AA11103371	So you're "pro-life".  But we should kill mothers?  Okay....|`|jsM8F4bLaa	it cant be 2000 babies every hour, that's just too much. :)|`|Rx2dYXnJaa	It is often not a happy decision for a person to abort a fetus.  there people who loose the fetus at different stages.  there may be different issues when they take this decission.  this is their own personal opinion.  they have every right to make this decission as they have to deal with it.  you and i cannot question thier decission as long as it does not effect you.  may be you feel not so good about people getting aborted in that stage.  <br>     i would say they it is better to die before comming into this cruel world and die facing a lot of problems.|`|b2bMy1EAaa	They are not 'babies' a lot of the time. I agree with abortion upto 8 weeks, if that came out of the womb it could not survive and would easily fit into an alien film. It is just the chance of a life, not life itself.<br>  <br>  Darwin is not a belief, he discovered evolution which in turn not all atheists believe. It also has nothing at all to do with abortion, it simply means the strongest genes/species etc survive. By your logic if 'atheists believed' that then humans would all be dead because we would 'kill' all 'babies'. All sects of society have abortions, stop speaking such ignorant and totally naive ideas.|`|aO1uVDvPaa	wow, evengelical much? :P<br>  a baby is considered a baby when it takes its first breath, it doesnt matter if you have kids or anything, it still is only considered a baby when it takes its first breath, <br>  oh and why is it not okay to "kill" baby's but its 100% fine to kill the doctors? crazy religious assholes..|`|bCIpOU6taa	I see your point.<br>  Every life is precious.<br>  I mean, if your mother abortioned you, you wouldn't be here today.<br>  Every child and human should have a chance to live.<br>  <br>  I got four thumbs down for this? e_e;<br>  Gosh people, I'm not asking you to agree with me, if you'd like to kill your future son/daughter, then I can't/wont stop you.<br>  Can't you just accept the fact that people have different opinions?|`|IogJBs2Naa	I think the better question is why is your pushing your bible thumping, right winged politics and morals onto everybody else is ok?|`|6o6a74uyaa	Everyone hates babies.

yYr412Vbaa	I do.<br>  I hate it.<br>  I just feel, why ask if you don't genuinely care?<br>  words shouldn't be wasted.|`|GqTSa85daa	Yes, it's not only rude it indicates it's just an insincere question.  It would be more correct to just say Hi or Hello.|`|ab3a357e04dd4e75e0b7722dbefccc6baa	Yes, I think that if they are going to bother to ask....otherwise, they shouldn't ask.  They should just say, "Hi."<br>  It's probably not intentional, but as a society, we've lost a lot of meaning in the things that we say.  <br>  If you roll off a litany of things for them to know about you when they ask, that might cure them of thinking that when asking, "How are you doing," that it doesn't actually mean something.<br>  <br>  Or, you can act "polite" and allow yourself to be ignored and ust know that they don't know their ettiquitte.|`|8abc5b9cab61ed51f5b3b0ffd3f6ca5aaa	Not necessarily.  It depends on the context.  I think it's common to say "how are you?" as a greeting, expecting "fine," "okay" or "great" as an answer but nothing too deep.  Of course, during a meaningful conversation with a friend, if they did that I would say they are rather self-absorbed and who needs that in a friend?|`|AA10381258	It is rude. I'm not sure why some people seem to think "how are you" is a greeting. I had a coworker who would use "what's up" as a greeting too. In passing. Never even broke stride. I got to the point that when I saw him, I would just nod. Can't quite make sense of it.
5856fa93d8bbf1a2aad2e827f63a50fcaa	Well, let's think about this. First and foremost the concept of "the bigger person" might be smart to keep in mind here. You always "win" this way. <br>  <br>  Second, Are you gay? If yes, are you out? The reason I ask, is because you may want to explore inward to see why her line of questioning is bothersome. If you don't care so much to do that and instead just want her to "get lost" then maybe these ideas will be useful: <br>  <br>  1. If your not comfortable with what she's calling you, regardless of how valid her point may be, one of the best approaches in life and in general is to "kill with kindness" -- This can be tricky though, and can often make one feel as if they've "given in" or "lost."<br>  <br>  "You know, I appreciate your always reminding me, but I'd really wish we could come up with something new to talk about, no offense" -- This might make her jaw drop...or it may end up egging her on...as she finds herself taken back by your response.<br>  <br>  If that approach doesn't suite you, or her, bring the situation to a  "human level" and ask her name (even if you already know it) and smile sincerely when asking. People like her tend to have a hard time screwing with those who seem smarter than they are. Don't engage and don't give in to her lame attempts at tearing you down.<br>  <br>  2. Another option is to ignore her, roll your eyes (while smiling sincerely) and start talking to someone you know who's nearby and totally brush her off. This shows her you're, well, "OVER IT"<br>  <br>  3. If this doesn't help, and the above suggestions don't play out in your favor... well, then you've got somewhat of stocker on your hands. Best approach at this point (unless you find her peaking in your kitchen window, etc) is to allow her to be her, and again, don't give into her attempts at making fun or shifting the spotlight off of her and onto you. Just be you, and let her do her thang.... even laugh as if you're allowing her to be lame... "say something like, you're such a knucklehead" and laugh and just keep on doing whatever it was you were doing.<br>  <br>  Hey, take care, good luck, and remember... you give her and those like her the power and control if you give in and try to "get her back" - don't stoop to her level... after all you're cool, hot, and weather your str8 or gay, look at this way... she's fixated on you, and she's a lesbian. Maybe she wants you!!! Hey extra points for turning the lesbo str8. Stay you, bro, chances are you're better than this whole issue and you just need to know that!<br>  <br>  -Peace|`|iwRxFoJSaa	next time she says "youre such a fag" <br>  <br>  <br>  say "i'm not a british servant, i'm not a cigarette, nor do I smoke"<br>  <br>  that should shut her up. <br>  <br>  if she says something like "no i meant like gay"<br>  <br>  <br>  you got these responses:<br>  <br>  "yes i'm quite happy"<br>  "no, im not all that happy today"<br>  <br>  or "where did you get that idea?"<br>  <br>  to the "yes" and "no" she probably wouldnt have much to say<br>  <br>  as for "where'd you get that idea"<br>  <br>  she might give you reasons like "the way you dress" or "the way you talk" etc<br>  <br>  then you might say something like "that's just me. plus you don't really know how a gay person acts/talks//etc// unless you are one. are you gay? "<br>  <br>  say that with a smile<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or.<br>  or.<br>  <br>  ooor.<br>  before all that,<br>  you can just say "takes one to know one"<br>  then smile, and walk away.|`|KcUaddzhaa	heres a good one tell her the reason why she became a lesbian is because no guy would ever date her...and the add the sad part is no girl would either you might as well just go jump off a 100 foot cliff and that nobody loves her and to stop hatin|`|HeLrqYMgaa	.... if you are<br>   "ya, too bad there aren't any cute girls around"<br>  <br>  ... if you're not<br>  "only when your momma is giving it up"|`|IZMaEWtyaa	tell her that the reason she is a lesbo is because she couldnt get herself a man!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  BURRRRRRRRRRRRRRN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|plzIUin5aa	haha, call her straight, send her reeling away!|`|c0xIsQXsaa	Just say.

I find the best way to deal with those people is to agree with them in an over-the-top manner that will just freak them out. Are you a girl? If so, try hitting on her insanely. Tell her you're having a crazy lesbian orgy tonight and you'd like her to join.<br>  <br>  Try to make it a bit sarcastic, but not too much. Just exaggerate ridiculously.<br>  <br>  That will confuse her and eventually deter her. If you get angry, you'll just make her think you have a reason to be defensive and she'll find it all the more hilarious.<br>  <br>  Make sure other people know that you're joking, though.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S.: There is absolutely nothing wrong with being gay, but I can understand that it can become very annoying when people say you're something you're not. If someone were to spread a rumour I'm straight, I'd be offended too. Just roll with the punches, don't take it to heart, and treat it all as one big joke.|`|WkifEuHHaa	Well if you are gay, say:<br>  "Well yes I am thanks for noticing, I'm glad you were so concerned you had to announce it for me, thank you."<br>  <br>  If you're not, say:<br>  "Well no I'm not, but if I were I would feel bad if I were you.. you're just degrading yourself [& others], how much sense does that make?

AA12006309	You're welcome to your opinion that it should be saved for marriage.  If that is the choice that is right for you, then it's awesome that you can live to that ideal.<br>  <br>  In my case, I've been married as well as divorced, and I don't believe in marriage any more at this point.  Not believing in marriage doesn't mean I don't believe in commitment.  I have sex with my long term partner because I love him and it's an important part of our relationship.<br>  <br>  It is possible to have a committed, monogamous relationship outside of the institution of marriage.|`|96AQZUGyaa	My opinion is that marriage "seals the deal" as it were. Basically it means you feel totally compatible with the person you want to be with. If you haven't had sex then how do you know if you are sexually compatible?<br>  <br>  Sex makes up an important part in a relationship and marriage and if you get married and then find out you aren't sexually compatible... then what?|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	I personally didn't want to save it because curiousity got the better of me. Once I actually had sex, and now that I'm older and have been twice married, if i had to do it over again, sex before marriage would almost be a requirement. Sex, unlike baking a cake, doesn't always come together just because you have the right ingredients. Having male and female genitalia and having those two be in love, is not a sure fire recipe for satisfying sex. Only someone who hadn't had sex before would think so because anyone who has, knows that you have to have some idea of when to do what. Only someone who hadn't had sex before would think that it was exciting to have to wait until one or both of the people involved figure it out. Anyone who has had it before knows that this can be extremely frustrating. That is why older men/older women and younger/ women/younger men are so good together. Someone with some experience is showing the other all the possibilities of sex, regarding sex without penetration and sexual positions and extending/maintaining your erection, etc. So, if I had a choice, the only way I could be a virgin when I got married was if the guy I was marrying wasn't. Someone there has to know something.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	That is just society today. They expect something by the 3rd or 4th date, it is a joke.

But it is happening at a much younger age.  Sex and morals go together.  Some have sex with multiple people, the same sex, some some have "unnatural" sex.  If you were brought up to believe that your virginity is special, and a gift to your husband, then stand by it.  If your not ready for sex with your boyfriend, stand by it.  But know why your holding off, and try discussing it with him.|`|fqRBdOWLaa	The matter is... if you really can succeed in this(not having sex with your bf or gf). <br>  If you succeed, then you have to ask yourself once: "Why haven't I still made sex with my partner or what has kept me for so long away from sex?" <br>  If the answer is pretty reasonable, e.g. struggling to save sex for marriage, then, you're ok, because you know quite well the answer...<br>  If you really don't have one, you have to make a visit at the doctor's, to check up your hormonal stage...|`|OsY0lmTCaa	More power to you hon.

bda465ikaa	I think that the main reason is that you are speaking from a perspective of someone who is less than 30 years old. <br>   The last time that a  woman was the first born child of the sovereign was 1840, she was dutifully skipped over for queen of the United kingdom, but she married the emperor of Germany.<br>    The last time someone was skipped over for being Catholic was 1714. People were regularly fighting to death over Protestant vs Catholic.I can remember people getting killed over religion in the UK.<br>    I think people just want to stick to tradition until they are actually faced with a crucial choice. So far no one really high up in the line of succession has converted. I think that if William's first born child is a girl, they will change the law. If William or Harry wants to marry a Catholic girl who won't convert, they will change the law.<br>  ============<br>  The argument is that the sovereign is not only head of state, but also the head of the Anglican church. However, Charles or his sons do not seem anti-religous, but they don't seem like church leaders. Parliament will simply change the law when they are actually forced to make a decision.<br>  -------<br>  Keep in mind that no monarchy in Europe had absolute primogeniture (meaning sex does not matter in the order of succession) until after WWII. Virtually every European monarchy has passed a law since then to change their rules of succession. But many of them were faced with a real choice.|`|1myyubNeaa	This is taken from a similar question asked on Yahoo! ANSWERS<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Due to historical tensions in the United Kingdom and its predecessor realms it was legislated (Act of Settlement 1701) that Catholics could not ascend to the throne in order to maintain the Church of England, which the king or queen is head of, which is Protestant. Because the Church of England is essentially broken off from the Roman Catholic church it would be a conflict to have a monarch who is technically head of the Chruch of England under the Pope.<br>  <br>  <br>  But yes, one can be a British dynast and marry a Catholic, but the moment they marry the Catholic they cease to in line of succession. For instance, Prince Michael of Kent married a Catholic, Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz, and she became a princess but Michael is no longer in line to the throne.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	Charles may change this rule(and it's about time).It is because of the Act of Settlement;the monarch is titular head of the Church of England,so s/he must be Anglican--blame it all on Henry VIII.<br>  Charles has expressed a wish to be known as Defender of the Faiths,being more open to all religions.<br>  Here is an explanation from <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheCurrentRoyalFamily/Successionandprecedence/Succession/Overview.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk/TheCurrentRoyalF...</a><br>  "The basis for the succession was determined in the constitutional developments of the seventeenth century, which culminated in the Bill of Rights (1689) and the Act of Settlement (1701). <br>  <br>  When James II fled the country in 1688, Parliament held that he had 'abdicated the government' and that the throne was vacant. The throne was then offered, not to James's young son, but to his daughter Mary and her husband William of Orange, as joint rulers. <br>  <br>  It therefore came to be established not only that the Sovereign rules through Parliament, but that the succession to the throne can be regulated by Parliament, and that a Sovereign can be deprived of his title through misgovernment. <br>  <br>  The succession to the throne is regulated not only through descent, but also by statute; the Act of Settlement confirmed that it was for Parliament to determine the title to the throne. <br>  <br>  The Act laid down that only Protestant descendants of Princess Sophia - the Electress of Hanover and granddaughter of James I - are eligible to succeed. Subsequent Acts have confirmed this. <br>  <br>  Parliament, under the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement, also laid down various conditions which the Sovereign must meet. A Roman Catholic is specifically excluded from succession to the throne; nor may the Sovereign marry a Roman Catholic. <br>  <br>  The Sovereign must, in addition, be in communion with the Church of England and must swear to preserve the established Church of England and the established Church of Scotland. The Sovereign must also promise to uphold the Protestant succession."|`|oDvlEvKUaa	Really?  I didn't know that.  I wouldn't call it bigotry though - if they said they couldn't marry someone who is in some crazy cult - would you consider that bigotry?  No.  They probably think that Catholics believe some strange things that is inappropriate for royalty to believe in.|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	Catholics are the only ones barred by law but really its restricted down to the Church of England.<br>  <br>  If you are Catholic then you have to get married in a Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  If you are a Catholic when you get married you agree that your children will be brought up Catholic. <br>  <br>  The King or Queen of the UK is also the Head of the Church of England.<br>  <br>  At the time the law was made this would have given the pope power over the UK<br>  <br>  Also because of the monarchs position as head of the Church of England it would be like having a Muslim Pope, it just wouldn't work.

Allah desires to keep away un-cleanliness from you, O Ahlul Bayt, and to make you as pure as possible.”(1)<br>  <br>  Anas ibn Malik adds that the Prophet did this for six months every day on his way for his morning prayers at the masjid.(2)<br>  <br>  Ref (just in case):<br>  (1) Ibn Mardawayh.

nQvcqVkNaa	Most people would tell you yes; but then most people do not know the Scriptures, they only follow what their favorite religious leader tells them.<br>  <br>  Here are some Scriptures that make it clear to "Hate the sin but not the sinner":<br>  <br>  Romans 7:22-23; For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:43-44; You have heard that it was said, 'Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I tell you: Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9; do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.<br>  <br>  So as to your question "is being homosexual a sin?" the answer is no. Science today has identified many hereditary diseases. Being an alcoholic is not a sin; one can not help being born with that affliction. However, getting drunk *is* a sin. The same is true for homosexuals and sexual sin.|`|xo4iux9gaa	" Do not be deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor male prostitutes, NOR HOMOSEXUALS.....shall inherit the kingdom of God ......  And such were some of you;  but you were washed, but you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord|`|Jswomud7aa	Apostle Paul, writing by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, declares that homosexuality "shall not inherit the kingdom of God" (I Corinthians 6:9; 10). Now Paul does not single out the homosexual as a special offender. He includes fornicators, idolators, adulterers, thieves, covetous persons, drunkards, revilers and extortioners. And then he adds the comment that some of the Christians at Corinth had been delivered from these very practices: "And such were some of you: But ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God" (I Corinthians 6:11). All of the sins mentioned in this passage are condemned by God, but just as there was hope in Christ for the Corinthians, so is there hope for all of us.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	The United Church of Christ, Unitarian Universalists, the Quakers, the Disciples of Christ, American Baptists and most non-orthodox Jewish groups as well as many Presbyterian, Episcopalian, Methodist and Lutheran churches believe that homophobia is sinful and morally repugnant.<br>  <br>  In contrast, the Catholic Church believes homophobia is acceptable and "loving" and they work to take civil rights away from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans.  They seek to destroy gay families and take away the religious liberty of churches which do not promote homophobia.  All of this is hidden behind the code phrase:  "Love the sinner, but hate the sin."<br>  <br>  Of course, those who support equality are never to question the Catholic Church's special right to discriminate.  If we do, they label us "intolerant" and "hateful."|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Having a homosexual orientation is not a sin. Homosexual relations, like all sexual relations outside marriage as recognized by the Catholic Church, is a sin.|`|RermzbWgaa	Yes it is a sin, and it is in the Bible, very clearly so.|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Yes.  Romans 1:18-32.  <')))><|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	2357 Homosexuality refers to relations between men or between women who experience an exclusive or predominant sexual attraction toward persons of the same sex. It has taken a great variety of forms through the centuries and in different cultures. Its psychological genesis remains largely unexplained. Basing itself on Sacred Scripture, which presents homosexual acts as acts of grave depravity,141 tradition has always declared that "homosexual acts are intrinsically disordered."142 They are contrary to the natural law. They close the sexual act to the gift of life. They do not proceed from a genuine affective and sexual complementarity. Under no circumstances can they be approved. <br>  <br>  2358 The number of men and women who have deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not negligible. This inclination, which is objectively disordered, constitutes for most of them a trial. They must be accepted with respect, compassion, and sensitivity. Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfill God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition. <br>  <br>  2359 Homosexual persons are called to chastity. By the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.|`|93359f8cb488652b055bb246c8283544aa	Yes, Leviticus 20:13 says, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them."|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	Technically being a homosexual isn't a sin in the eyes of Christian churches- it is acting on the sexual desires.  They claim a person can be a homosexual but then they must be celibate.|`|AA10011095	They think there is no such thing as a homosexual.  They think we are all made by God as heteros, and some are just very sinful people who want to be attracted to the same sex because of choice.

Paul points to homosexuality as the prime, self evident evidence of humanity's rebellion against God.|`|NWopkX4baa	Many Christains believe that homosexuality as we understand it is not a sin.|`|nS83ag9raa	actually ...the act of homosexuality is what is sinful.<br>  <br>  the feelings themselves are not|`|V0oc22ryaa	Yes, it is a sin, born one or not.|`|r1WMBKvuaa	It is only a sin if you are a member of the religion and are required to obey.<br>  If you are outside of the religion you are an unbeliever and it doesn't matter what you do, you are an outsider. Inside the religion, you may be judged, outside you are free to do what you like. I Cor 5:12-13<br>  No one has the right to judge those outside the religion.<br>  There is no argument, you don't have the right to judge outsiders!|`|oMF6bXCZaa	Why are you interested?   There are other belief systems other than Christian/Catholic religions, and then there are Atheists and Agnostics etc.   It is just the judgmental, prejudicial people of any religion or non religion, who hate another for any reason.  Don't you agree?|`|0YQRbq9faa	Is this passage clear enough?  Read it and ponder on it.  It is from the English Standard Version of the Bible.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:9-11   Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,  10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.  11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.|`|6JHoNf3faa	Yes but...........there are a lot of sins and all fall short (meaning no one is w/o sin) and it is only through belief and grace that one is saved.<br>  <br>  Stealing is a sin, looking at another woman with lust in your heart (males) is a sin if your married, on and on and on,|`|JXMpZiwxaa	The Catholic Church asserts that it is okay for one to have a homosexual orientation, but does not permit a person to act on his or her homosexual desires and commit sins of lust.

7gH7sgi6aa	I actually am a landlord and received one of these recently.  It was from a young couple whom one of them is going to school.  With the hard economic times and school loans they cannot afford school, books, lab fess, electricity, gas, water, sewage, rent and their car note.  They have lived in my house for two years and have been very good tenants.  I took a temporary reduction of $100 off their rent until they graduate from college.<br>  Simply state your reasons for the economic hardship and I am sure if you are a good tenant your landlord will agree.  Good luck.<br>  Peace, Love & Happiness|`|04fd844d2fb4de917c15eec963f99e0caa	In your letter, you need to state why you need a reduction in rent and for how long.

Good luck|`|VMY7No0eaa	GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Is your lease nearly up?

nw0fqXj9aa	I'm certain it's merely unfortunate circumstance. Lets not forget that millions of others are also having a hard time getting employed right now. Hardly an act of god teaching you a lesson.

Let him fill you with the knowledge you are looking for. You must be open or it won't work. Christians sometimes suffer more than atheist do but there are also hundreds of examples in the Bible where people had to hit bottom before they came to believe in God. I know a lot of people who had strict religious parents that turned from God. Please don't let your parents come between you and God. Please go to God in prayer.|`|crwV0sdKaa	I think that you still believe in your 'skydaddy' if that's what you would like to call God. If you don't, and you want to, then you may want to go to your parents for guidance, because you would not want your whole religious life to fall away right before your eyes. Trust in the LORD with all of your heart, with all of your soul, and with all of your mind, and he will set your paths straight. Just always remember this verse. If you need more, there are plenty more where that came from. <br>  <3'a and tacos, ~Madds|`|6jAVElX7aa	well first of all I would imagine you are causing grief to your parents, by turning your back on religion.  So you need to make peace with your parents. If you dont believe as they do, as no one yet has been perfected in faith, except Christ Jesus, doesnt mean that everything the church holds to is correct. But I know the baptist do believe that Christ is head of the church, and Lord and Saviour, which is what you should hang unto, to have faith in Him, and ask Him for guidance in all of this|`|ugcMPr20aa	Well to start out....GOD IS REAL!!!!!!!! Who do you think created the universe and you!!!!!! There is a God, whether you want to believe it or not. I want to share with you this quote..."How can anyone lose who chooses to become a Christian? If, when he dies, there turns out to be no God and his faith was in vain, he has lost nothing, infact, he has been happier in life than his non-believing friends. If, however, there is a God and a heaven and a hell, then he has gained heaven and his skeptical friends will have lost everything in hell", Blaise Pascal. Jesus came down to this earth to die for ALL of our sins including mine and yours and so that we can everlasting life with Him. John 3:16 says, For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whomever believes in Him should not perish  but have everlasting life. To answer your question...God wakes up His children that have fallen astray to bring them back to Himself because He LOVES them. You sound like a fallen child and God is trying to bring you back to Himself! Your friends that turned back to Him went through hard times because God is going to test our faith throughout our lives. It is better to go through hard times with God on your side then to go through hard times without God. I hope and pray you WAKE UP and turn back to God. The ONLY WAY is God. You won't find His love or everlasting life in any other religion.|`|73n1SExgaa	You didn't really believe back them or you would still believe today. You don't lose your salvation. once you truly believe it is sealed. So if somethings are happening to you i might just happen to be God. He works in ways to get your attention. Why not put your trust and faith in him today and start all over. Christians don't have a life of getting what they want it rains on the just and the unjust alike but they are all ways that God uses to get you to know and trust him. He gets your attention because he wants you and loves you.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	Your not getting a job would have to do with the economy being in a 25-year-low.

I couldnt imagine my  whole life....|`|AA11616515	huh?|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Bad stuff happens to everyone.  If you haven't noticed, we are in a declined economy (depression).  Jobs are fewer and harder to find.  Logic would have told you this instead your primitive Christian-trained mind jumped to the first superstitional belief, that God must be doing it to you to pay you back for not believing in him.  If you truly are an atheist and a free-thinker, you would know better.  If you truly believe that this is what your God does, why in the world would you consider following (worshipping) him.  At least give yourself a higher standard for what kind of skydaddy is worth your time.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	The bible says that the wicked even prosper.  Just because you don't believe in God doesn't mean that you won't get a job or something.  I don't believe that God would be against you for not believing.  Some people find Jesus and God makes their lives great.  Some people find Jesus and God makes their lives worse.  I've pretty much always believed in Jesus.  For the times when I didn't have a lot of faith my life was OK.  In high school I didn't really believe and my life was the best it ever was.  Now I believe and my life is OK but recently, for about the past year, it sucked.  People who love God have God's wrath against them in some way.  They may have great lives but if you struggle you are rewarded and can grow in faith.  God's will is what it is.  Maybe he isn't helping you get a job and that's why.  Maybe you just couldn't get a job.  A lot of people who don't believe in God are very successful.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Hi there. I am a Christian, but I think the economy may be the reason you are having a hard time finding a job.  I am saddened that you left the faith, and I sincerely hope that you will consider coming back one day. I was raised Catholic, and I ditched the faith too. <br>  But some things happened in my life, where our loving and compassionate Jesus really did show me that HE is the way the truth and the life. <br>  After a remarkable conversion, I will never ever leave Him again.<br>  I don't know, maybe a little faith may be just what you need for a fresh start in AZ.<br>  I sure hope so.<br>  God bless you.|`|vGA8CWnZaa	You need to commit an act of what christians call sin so that you can finally get past the christian rhetoric still lingering and evident in your mind.<br>  <br>  I guess start with the easy ones like lying.  Maybe find a way to cheat on something financial.  Something the bank would catch easily, like depositing $100 but writing you desposited $150 on the slip.  You would at least be satisfied with knowing you made an attempt at it.|`|e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	See, you turned your back on god and now look what's happening.  Read your bible.  God is vindictive, destructive, and vengeful.  Vengeance is his!  You'll suffer until you run back to him and ask for forgiveness.  You don't need opinions, you need to find your way back to god before he smites you!|`|NCzNtR8Gaa	In my opinion, god loves and helps everyone, atheist or not, Go get god in your life and pray and see what happens.|`|1GvzuVo1aa	What makes you think that God isn't real?<br>  <br>  To answer your question about HOW they can say that? They just can... with their mouth.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Logic isn't part of your life, because you claim that God doesn't exist when you have absolutely no proof to back it up.<br>  <br>  Also, you assume that all Theists are brainwashed, not taking into account the FACT that a lot of them have made that decision for themselves.<br>  <br>  Only a person without any knowledge of what Logic is, would say that.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You said they want to keep your brain washed? That's good! You don't wanna get that thing dirty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: And what does the Bible have to do with the God? Or are you implying that Christianity is the only religion out there that contains a concept of God?<br>  <br>  You will come to a Mormon or a Muslim and tell him/her that God does not exist because Bible is fake?

It became politically united through the expansion of the kingdom of Wessex, whose king Athelstan brought the whole of England under one ruler for the first time in 927, although unification did not become permanent until 954, when Edred defeated Eric Bloodaxe and became King of England.<br>  <br>  If you are doing a Project on the UK then it is going to get a lot more messy, there are 100s of years of wars between England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland and Northern Ireland.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	About 50 billion years ago, when Pangaea broke up.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	When was England formed as a monarchy?The concept of a single ruler unifying different tribes based in England developed in the eighth and ninth centuries in figures such as Offa and Alfred the Great, who began to create centralised systems of government.<br>  <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk</a> lists the first monarch as around 400 AD:<br>  "In the Dark Ages during the fifth and sixth centuries, communities of peoples in Britain inhabited homelands with ill-defined borders. Such communities were organised and led by chieftains or kings. <br>  <br>  Following the final withdrawal of the Roman legions from the provinces of Britannia in around 408 AD these small kingdoms were left to preserve their own order and to deal with invaders and waves of migrant peoples such as the Picts from beyond Hadrian's Wall, the Scots from Ireland and Germanic tribes from the continent.<br>  <br>  King Arthur, a larger-than-life figure, has often been cited as a leader of one or more of these kingdoms during this period, although his name now tends to be used as a symbol of British resistance against invasion.<br>  <br>  The invading communities overwhelmed or adapted existing kingdoms and created new ones - for example, the Angles in Mercia and Northumbria. Some British kingdoms initially survived the onslaught, such as Strathclyde, which was wedged in the north between Pictland and the new Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. <br>  <br>  By 650 AD, the British Isles were a patchwork of many kingdoms founded from native or immigrant communities and led by powerful chieftains or kings. In their personal feuds and struggles between communities for control and supremacy, a small number of kingdoms became dominant: Bernicia and Deira (which merged to form Northumbria in 651 AD), Lindsey, East Anglia, Mercia, Wessex and Kent. <br>  <br>  Until the late seventh century, a series of warrior-kings in turn established their own personal authority over other kings, usually won by force or through alliances and often cemented by dynastic marriages. <br>  <br>  According to the later chronicler Bede, the most famous of these kings was Ethelberht, king of Kent (reigned c.560-616), who married Bertha, the Christian daughter of the king of Paris, and who became the first English king to be converted to Christianity (St Augustine's mission from the Pope to Britain in 597 during Ethelberht's reign prompted thousands of such conversions). <br>  <br>  Ethelberht's law code was the first to be written in any Germanic language and included 90 laws. His influence extended both north and south of the river Humber: his nephew became king of the East Saxons and his daughter married king Edwin of Northumbria (died 633). <br>  <br>  In the eighth century, smaller kingdoms in the British Isles continued to fall to more powerful kingdoms, which claimed rights over whole areas and established temporary primacies: Dalriada in Scotland, Munster and Ulster in Ireland. In England, Mercia and later Wessex came to dominate, giving rise to the start of the monarchy. <br>  <br>  Throughout the Anglo-Saxon period the succession was frequently contested, by both the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy and leaders of the settling Scandinavian communities. The Scandinavian influence was to prove strong in the early years. <br>  <br>  It was the threat of invading Vikings which galvanised English leaders into unifying their forces, and, centuries later, the Normans who successfully invaded in 1066 were themselves the descendants of Scandinavian 'Northmen'."|`|gGd3v3M5aa	Made?

wB3AbJyLaa	"Why do you believe in Christ?" You see, God makes sense of the resurrection. If Jesus of Nazareth really did come back from the dead, then we have a divine miracle on our hands, and a pretty powerful evidence for the existence of God. Without assuming the New Testament is inspired by the word of God. Personally, I think the very best explanation is the same one provided by eyewitnesses: That God raised Jesus from the dead. Here are the following four facts: Firstly, the location of Jesus' burial was widely known and agreed on. No competing stories contradict what the Bible says about this, and it's reported in very early information that came too soon for it to be based on legend. Secondly, the Sunday after the crucifixion, Jesus' tomb was found empty. Both Jesus' followers and those who denied that Jesus could be raised, like Jewish leaders and the Roman soldiers guarding the tomb, agree on the fact that the tomb was empty. Thirdly, on multiple occasions and under various circumstances, different individuals and groups of people experienced appearances of Jesus alive again, after the tomb was found empty. Lastly, the original disciples suddenly and sincerely came to believe that Jesus was risen from the dead. Sincerely enough to be will to die for that belief.|`|2dPqad7Eaa	Because Christ is in MY heart he always tells me what is right and wrong I may not be able to see him but I sure can feel him he died on the cross he went right down to hell and took away the keys of life and death away from the devil and made it so that we can be free to go to heaven which I'll be at when I die so I believe in Christ Jesus.|`|KhJwOurLaa	They believed because of instilled child-based fears.|`|rmAX5dteaa	I belive in him because he answers all my questions|`|bXHcZ2yEaa	"Religion is the spark for almost every war."<br>  <br>  You are mistaken. Wars that have been started by atheists in one century overshadows all religious wars of every religion in history combined. People dying for Him is another thing, like if you were a martyr; we would then be worthy of suffering for Christ.<br>  <br>  If a person who went to jail and prayed, that's fine, but he would have to get out and receive the sacraments. At least he's changed and is accepted in Christianity, unlike society. The person who was murdered obviously must have committed a sin in his lifetime, that goes for anyone. There was no reason for him to come to Christianity in the first place. <br>  <br>  Everything is God's will and he does not wish the death of a sinner, but rather to repent and live, so a situation like the one you've mentioned would be rare. God would have given the person many chances.|`|rHqe7oMoaa	For the majority of people it is because of childhood indoctrination. Sure, they may give you some nice answers, but that's not the truth of the matter (usually).|`|cic4J2hzaa	God sees the bigger picture|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	Many of the answers given above say the wars etc..are God’s will.  THAT IS NOT TRUE.  He communicated with us through the scriptures so we should look there instead of giving our personal opinions, right?  Is it okay to check out several religions to see what “fits” your own philosophy?  No, not if we want to please the Creator and not if we want to live.  The road to life is a narrow one and few are finding it.  (Matt 7:14)  Prov 3:5 says “trust in Jehovah with all your heart and do not lean upon your own understanding.  In all your ways take notice of him and he himself will make your paths straight.”<br>  <br>  So why are there wars?<br>  <br>  WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BIG CONTROVERSY.  When Satan caused Adam & Eve t sin he in effect was challenging God’s right to rule. His sovereignty.  God could have destroyed Satan but that would not have answered the question for all the millions of spirit creatures, would it?<br>  <br>  Instead, Satan was given possession of the earth for a time and had an opportunity to try every type of government and method of ruling men (1 John 5:19, 2 Cor 4:4).  He is the god of this system and the ruler of it, so the force behind all the suffering.  Are we left there?  NO<br>  <br>  Dan 2:44 says “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be brought to ruin…...it will crush and put an end to all these kingdoms (man’s governments just depicted in a dream to Nebuchadnezzer and interpreted by Daniel) and it itself will stand to times indefinite”  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind the whole time Jesus was on earth he preached God’s Kingdom as the only hope for mankind.  It’s even in the model prayer at Matt 6: 9-13 “Let your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven” (KJV)  By means of this kingdom, with Jesus as its King, all the damage Satan has done will be erased, including death.<br>  <br>  The kingdom is being preached worldwide right now as a part of the sign of the last days.  (Matt 24:14) Jehovah’s Witnesses are the only ones doing this preaching work.  And btw, we're totally pacifists.  You never found an American witness killing a brother from another country in any war on earth.  We take Jehovah's commands to heart.  We have gone to concentration camps, prisons, and died instead.  Please call a local Kingdom Hall and ask for a free Bible study in your home. <br>  <br>  The book “WHAT DOES THE BIBLE REALLY TEACH?” has a chapter, “Why Does God Allow Suffering” It will begin to answer your questions.  Don’t give up.<br>  <br>  You can get this book at a local Kingdom Hall, from someone who calls on your home, or contact us through the website at www.watchtower.org|`|zMcHYQeBaa	It's God's work<br>  <br>  Hell is the grave.

oMF6bXCZaa	`Black people never moving up in the social ladder`.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but I do not agree with that statement.  There are many, many wonderful black people who came from practically nothing,(as far as other peoples standards are concerned) and who were determined to make something of their lives.<br>  <br>  OPrah<br>  Denzel Washington<br>  Martin Luther King<br>  President Obama<br>  etc. etc.<br>  <br>  It is the same with every ethnic group.  There are very poor people everywhere.  Some choose to keep the circle going and others decide that they are going to make choices that will give them a good education, good job, and dreams that come true.<br>  <br>  Yes, there are the gangs and the education system is not good, but out of some of these gangs and out of very bad education systems have come some very special people.<br>  <br>  Oprah was very overweight, was black, had been sexually abused, and came from a very low income family.  She  was determined not to stay like that and pulled herself out of that situation and is now one of the most influencial and richest women in the world.<br>  <br>  It really is a state of mind.  One can always change ones mind and have dreams, no matter what your ethnic background is.  Even white people have the same situation regarding gangs and low education in some areas.  Some stay in and some get out.<br>  <br>  My lawyer is black.

Racism (for the most part) has dwindled down to almost nothing, except for the hate I hear coming from most blacks on the internet these days towards whites. I think that black people need to remind themselves that there is hope for a better life if they put in the effort and make the right choices. I think that they see thier surroundings and give up hope too easily. I've worked for plenty of black upper management and the one trait they seem to have in common is that they're tough as nails and have paid their dues. <br>  <br>  The education system needs to be better as well as does the justice system. Laws that seem to support crimes and criminals need to be harsher to increase the fear of doing a crime. First time criminals should be placed into mandatory counseling to help them figure out what is really wrong with them and how to improve themselves from the inside out and to teach them how to improve their surroundings. <br>  <br>  Get rid of rap music, most of it is degrading to blacks, glorifies the sh*tty life and supports anger and resentment. Black people need more reinforcement of good role models (i.e. Bill Cosby, MLK Jr, Denzel W., H. Berry, Oprah, B. Obama, etc) and fewer thugs in the spotlight like rappers who are gang members, who glorify gang life and gang mentality.  I think Cosby said it best that blacks are responsible for thier own mess these days, they're to blame and they should and must take responsibility to fix it, otherwise they'll never get out of it.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	I don't agree with your statement.

We just don't know they're angels because they don't look like what we think angels should look like.<br>  <br>  An angel could be the classmate that gives you a pencil when you can't find yours or the stranger that pulls you back just before you step in front of a bus. An angel could be the friend that gives you a hug and a shoulder to cry on when you've had a rotten day or the divine being that speaks to you in a dream.<br>  <br>  I think we've all encountered angels at one time or another. Most of us just don't recognize them for what they are.|`|rRVzWFYZaa	My grandmother almost died as a child, and said she saw an angel then and irregularly for the rest of her life.  She said the angel started coming more frequently in the months before her terminal cancer diagnosis, and they were very calming to her.  She didn't know why she saw the angel, but said she just did.<br>  <br>  And my grandmother was an absolutely wonderful, perfectly sane woman.|`|sh78ZSPbaa	I don't have any personal experiences, but there are plenty in the Holy Bible! You should totally read it and see what I mean! It is an amazing book. <br>  But people see angels mostly because:<br>  a) they are a messenger from God.<br>  b) it is Satan trying to deceive you.
7ff82885c9d5d1f343a4664e9d97a78aaa	Any Catholic can receive the Eucharist after baptism. If they were baptized at birth they must receive the sacrament of reconciliation first (confession). Otherwise, when an adult becomes baptized after completing the R.I.C.A. course he/she may receive before reconciliation as the baptism removes ALL sins.|`|5shqstYraa	Revelation 18:4 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.<br>  5 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities.<br>  6 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her double according to her works: in the cup which she hath filled fill to her double.<br>  7 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.<br>  8 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with fire: for strong  the Lord God who judgeth her.|`|FsX5VoXKaa	In my church we practise Holy Communion every week for believers only. <br>  This is because when we look at the bread and the blood we remember what Jesus Christ did for us on the cross and what His death brings. <br>  <br>  Like the lamb in the Passover, the israelites who ate the lamb ALL 3 million of them walked out strong and healthy. If that was the shadow of the greater covenant to come, then we as Christians who have the true substance that is Jesus can rest assured, that by partaking of the body of the true Lamb of God we can be made whole spiritually, mentally and physically. <br>  <br>  <br>  Baptism is actually a declaration to the world (and to the devil) that you now belong to God and they had better watch out if they mess with you. For whatever the devil takes from you, God will make him pay back double. So its alright actually for Christians who have not been baptized to partake.|`|oGVvEl3Maa	ask a priest or pastor... and they can guide you in the answer to your question...  preferably at the church you are attending... <br>  <br>  it will also allow you the opportunity to discuss your faith with those entrusted with the Eucharist... and may lead you to participate more fully in the activities of the church.  good luck and God Bless...<br>  <br>  ultimately it is up to our LORD.|`|6683fa949dfc425a21a5980b5f9d8a9daa	In catholocism you can not receive holy communion unless you make your sacrament of first communion, it doesn't matter if you are baptized.  I believe that protestants are more lenient in terms of receiving the eucharist, but this is in the US, don't know about anywhere else.|`|68lLAQnKaa	yes you can receive communion in protestant churches...  not sure about the catholic stuff though|`|d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	Almost all Protestant churches, with the exception of Lutheran Missouri synod, have open communion. Open communion means that people of other Christian sects are welcome at the table as long as they've been baptized and profess faith in Jesus Christ as their Savior. The Anglicans (C of E and Episcopalians) also have open communion.<br>  In the Roman Catholic church both baptism and teaching the true meaning of the Eucharist within the Catholic church are required. This is because the elements of communion are considered to be the actual flesh and blood of Jesus.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	It's important to be properly disposed to receive Jesus in the authentic Holy Eucharist, because to do otherwise would be a sacrilege.<br>  <br>  Catholics are trained to know how things ought to be done, so as to avoid problems of that type.<br>  <br>  If you're a baptized adult Catholic who has never made your first holy communion, your parish priest can easily get you whatever instruction you might need and also hear your confession, so that you can finally begin receiving communion, at Mass.<br>  <br>  A Catholic is prohibited from receiving communion from other groups.<br>  <br>  Most of those other groups have no such prohibition, because their communion remains ordinary bread and wine, never becoming the real and substantial body and blood of Jesus Christ.

One of my relatives used to have a lamp like that.<br>  <br>  2. Open doors without using arms (opens automatically). There are sensor on the doors, when someone walks near it, it will automatically open.<br>  <br>  3. climb stairs that move underneath you. It's called an escalator. They do that.<br>  <br>  4. and for the paper towel to release paper towel, it's also a sensor too. I haven't been anywhere where they have paper towel dispensers like that. I think there recent.

La tienda tenía unos balones de baloncesto como los nuestros. Mi hermano y yo estuvimos jugando con ellos pero entonces cuando solté la pelota, pegó contra un anaquél y muchas cosas se rompieron.  Hubieras visto cómo mis papás me rega?aban todo el camino a casa. Mis papás no son tan comprensivos como los tuyos.<br>  Bueno, hasta luego.<br>  <br>  Dear cousin,<br>  how are you? And your parents? How are they? Mine are OK. Today, I went to a store and while I was looking at the merchandise, I thought about you. The store had some footballs just like ours. My brother and I were playing with them but them when I let go of the ball, it hit a shelf and a lot of things got broken. You should have seen my parents, how they were scolding me all the way home. My parents aren't as understanding as yours are.<br>  Well, see you later.

You need to stop worrying about those friends and start looking to a new future. Life IS full of wonderful things. I'm only 15 and I know that. Go out and walk about the city. Pick up a hobby, like photography, or join a cheap class that can teach you to do pottery and soon you'll meet friends.<br>  <br>  Doing the things that you love to do will eventually lead you to people who love the same things too.

AA10895799	First, U have to spell correctly when U apply for non-profit status. ( I am sure U saw that U had misspellings when u wrote this!)  If U R not ready to apply and u have some community help, just write (again) a good mission statement and a proposal that shows what U  will do to carry out your mission of providing musical instruments (guitars, etc) to enrich children's lives.  send out your statements to the local press for local and community news and to local radio stations. <br>  <br>   Sounds like a  great idea!!  U will receive applicants for your guitars, but don't be hasty.  If U receive donations of money or instruments, U have to carefully account for each donation U receive AND  properly acknowledge them.  Do not hand out the instruments until U have met the individuals and their families and they are taught the care and handling of those instruments.  Provide for lessons, too, and get volunteers for that.  Carefully screen your volunteers, too.  Have fun!|`|VcrDOsFKaa	do what my group did.<br>  we organised a concert and the proceeds went to cancer children.<br>  in the concert, we sang ourselves in our own hoarse and cracked voices and played with our own instruments the little we could play.<br>  and people were so overwhelmed that they gave so much money for the funds for the kids. the place was flooded with people and those who could not attend sent in donations from all over.<br>  <br>  these things really work u know, people have a night out and the needy have a smile.

Every black person is an individual and has different tastes, views, likes, dislikes etc. <br>  Just like there is no such thing as acting white, asian etc etc.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I know someone like this.  He comes from a broken home, his mother moved 2 hours away from his dad.  He was raised with african american men coming and going from his mom's bed and he goes to an inner school that is mostly black.  He wears long braids and baggy clothes, does rap.  I think the black culture has become his family and he was encouraged to do so by his mother.  It is a sad story.  His father has tried to stay in his life (never missing a visitation or child support payment.)   There is a name for these people. But it may be a violation to say it here.|`|VsamHLPOaa	Well I don't speak ebonics, hardly listen to any rap and never wore a weave. Now that I have stated that I can tell you that I do see where your coming from. Most of the things you have stated are attributed to the black culture and all I can say to this is maybe its a phase or maybe its something about the culture that speaks to them, something that they like. I wouldn't say its shameful or betrayal of their race as long as they still acknowledge their own race.|`|K0mvCFhEaa	What exactly does it mean to act "Black?"<br>  <br>  I'm "Black" and I don't use slang, I don't dress in hip-hop attire, I don't wear weave (I grow my own hair), and I listen to alternative rock music.<br>  <br>  What the heck am I?<br>  <br>  Black or not Black?<br>  <br>  OF COURSE I"M BLACK!<br>  <br>  What you mean to say is IGNORANT.<br>  <br>  People want to act ignorant.<br>  <br>  Although I agree with what you are trying to say.<br>  <br>  When Whites, Hispanics, and Asians try to act ignorant(what you call "Black") I think they look ridiculous.<br>  <br>  It saddens me to see this.<br>  <br>  I especially can't stand when they try to steal aspects of "Black" culture.<br>  <br>  They did it 50 years ago and they are still doing it now.<br>  <br>  When Elvis adopted "Black" culture, people thought that it was cool.<br>  <br>  I think Justin Timberlake definitely tries to act "Black" too.<br>  <br>  I'm not even White and I find this to be shameful.<br>  <br>  I thought that he was just a wannabe and everyone else can definitely see it.|`|ce26AOVzaa	black is in season I guess.

UmjJmYsjaa	The Jews are a bit biased in thier interpretations.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 23:27 who think to make my people forget my name by their dreams that they tell one another, even as their fathers forgot my name for Baal<br>  <br>  They dont even want to interpret God's name, but ignore it, just like the bible said.<br>  <br>  Edit: i'm afraid you've asked a tough question and i know nobody here knows the answer. Most of them dont even know God's name, less alone something like that. Its not complex but it requires some work.<br>  <br>  OK to answer your question.<br>  Jacob<br>  suffering, The humility he had to show to is Brother Esau, the fact that he had to escape because his bother was going to kill him.<br>  sacrifice, came when he endured 17 years for the marriage of Rachel in the agreement that he'll marry her. His yes meant yes.<br>  rejection, the only rejection i remember was from his brother, or his dad Issac when he got blessed but was in discuise as his brother Esau. It was a form of rejection<br>  persecution<br>  again at the hands of his brother due to Esau selling his first born right to Jacob. He did think it was of value.<br>  <br>  Joseph<br>  suffering, Suffered in the Hands of his brothers when they sold him into egypt as a slave. He also spent years in prison for a crime he did not commit, but he stayed faithful and so Jehovah used him.<br>  sacrifice, during that time there was no law concerning fornication but he knew that Jehovah was righteous yet he maintained his intergrity and sacrificed his name and life and was sent to prison. He could have been executed.<br>  rejection, Rejection came from his brothers that didnt beleive that he was able, with the help of Jehovah, tell what dreams meant and thier meaningns. For that he was persecuted and rejected.<br>  persecution. The same thing i mentioned above. He was persecuted for not fornicating and being in God's side and so he was sent to prison.<br>  <br>  Job<br>  suffering, JOb suffered the most. He was quite weathy and lost EVERYTHING he had. His family, health, wife, money. Everything.<br>  sacrifice, He maintained his intergirty to Jehovah, he could have gotten angry at GOd but sacrificed everything and still maintained loyalty to Jehovah, and proved the devil wrong.<br>  rejection. His wife rejected him and his friends rejected him. He must of felt horrible, but still looked to Jehovah for hope.<br>  persecution, again he was persecuted for being loyal by his wife and frineds, but mostly from the great adversay Satan the Devil. But he maintained his loyalty.|`|8I9uduIiaa	Why would you ask JWs to interpret and explain things from Jewish history?<br>  <br>  If you want to know about events from Jewish history, ask Jews!|`|ysO4qJX6aa	"Paperback", didn't you know that Jehovah Witnesses are Jews.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Sorry sweetie, but you really ought to be doing your own homework....<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	English assignment eh??<br>  <br>  Well, if it doesn't kill you, it can only strengthen you.|`|AA10988107	Jw's are bible students, the bible is all about Matt.1:1-17, Abraham,<br>  Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, the twelve tribes and their families<br>  and the law, these were of the true God, Exo.6:3, the God and Father<br>  of Jesus, who was the word made flesh John 1:14, John 17:1-26, 20:17, all one needs to be perscuted is to believe in this true God,<br>  Jesus and the word of truth, John 8:28-32. Bible students qualify.<br>  Jesus was the greates witness for his God and Father, Rev.1:1-3,5; 3:14.<br>  Because they were of the family of Abraham, they knew who the true<br>  God was and how important it was to live in harmony with his will.<br>  <br>  Jacob had the birthright of Esau, all kept it a secret from Isaac, as it<br>  turned out, Esua did not want to admit it, so Rebecca had to cause<br>  it to come to be as it was a fact but still protect Isaac, so when Jacob<br>  was blessed, Esau was as furious as Cain and had only murder in his<br>  heart for Jacob, so Rebecca sent Jacob to her brother Laban and there<br>  he saw Rachel, he worked 7 years for her, but was given Leah instead,<br>  he worked another 7 years for Rachel and each sister was given a<br>  sister as her hand maid, from these 4 sisters and their arrangements<br>  came the 12 tribes of Jacob/Israel and Joseph was the 11th son, but<br>  the 12th child, he was sold at age 17 to merchant men by his oldest<br>  half brothers, he was taken into Egypt and sold, then accused falsely and in prision 13 years, after that he was made governor of Egypt, so he did bring Jacob age 130, Gen.47:9,11, and all 70 in family, settled in Rameses Egypt, Jacob died in 17 years, Gen.47:28, Joseph died in<br>  53 years, Gen.50:26, end of the book of Genesis. At a point Job one<br>  of the 70 family members left Egypt after Joseph died, he was the most just man on earth, he did not escape perscution from Satan Job 2:1-6, as the tribes in Egypt were now under bondage, so that by the time Moses is born, Pharoah has ordered all male infants to be killed, Acts 7:1-60, the perscuted Stephen tells their story, Stephen includes<br>  the death of the Lord and Savior Christ Jesus that has been killed and<br>  and has ascended to God's right hand, Jesus says as he was hated,<br>  rejected and perscuted, so will all who cling to God and his truth.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Wow, that's a big subject.  Here are a few things in outline form.<br>  <br>  c.

This birthright was passed on to Abraham's heir Isaac, and to Isaac's heir, originally Esau.  But the account in Gen. 25:29-34 shows that Esau despised that birthright, which put "all the families of the ground" at risk, so Jacob arranged to buy it from for one bowl of stew.  Later (Gen 27) Isaac their father, apparently unaware of this, tried to bestow the accompanying blessing, including most of his possessions, on Esau, and Esau dishonestly tried to get it, so Jacob's mother arranged for Jacob to take Esau's place and receive the blessing by proxy, claiming to be Esau (which he was, for the purposes of the blessing, since Esau had sold him the birthright) to his blind and aged father.  God did not condemn it and later blessed Jacob and counted him as the heir of Isaac (Ex. 3:6), so Jacob didn't do anything wrong in this.<br>  <br>  Jacob did receive persecution from Esau for this, according to the end of chapter 27, and had to flee for his life and live a difficult life (Gen. 31:36-42)  as an alien resident until Esau and he werer reconciled, after God generously provided for Esau as well.<br>  <br>  Be sure to read the whole book of Esther!

In typical government document management if someone is making correction marks on a draft document, that document is kept with corrections in a working file while the new clean document is produced with the corrections in place, and no markings on the document.  This provides a history of changes made which can be important for version control, and acts as a backup to review which changes were authorized vs. which ones were actually implemented.

There are only two sources of power in the universe.  One is God, the absolute power and the other is satan, a lesser, but evil power.  If you are not serving God and are dabbling in things of the occult, you are moving about in the realm of satan, and don't let anyone tell you differently.<br>  <br>  If you are a Christian, you need to stay away from this.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes you are.|`|c0KKHMsAaa	the only people that believe in Satan are Christians. so no matter what you do, you're spiritually "safe".|`|lh8Tn02Naa	The very obvious answer to your question is of course you are compromising your beliefs and you know it.<br>  <br>  Open-mindedness is great, but there is also such a thing as discernment.  My concern about witchcraft is not whether it is pure or evil, but whether it has any connection with the rational world.  Have you really seen it "work", or has someone bamboozled you into seeing what you want to see?  Frankly, I think it is best to adopt a position of extreme skepticism until you are confronted with indisputable proof; otherwise you're a sucker for any superstitious nonsense that's going.<br>  <br>  There are  many different ways of looking at the spiritual world which harmonize with Christianity, including forms of "paganism" - nature worship - which is what some people, said by others to be witches, are really into.  I'm OK with that.  Witchcraft in the strict sense is beyond the pale; it's about trying to control people.  Christianity is about loving them.|`|IKb6RYmNaa	Witchcraft has its origins in the Original Pagan (Pre-christian) Religions. This is the True Spirituality and you will not find it or any of the mysteries of the universe written down in a book in which no one ever reads.<br>  <br>  The christian cult has slaughtered our ancestors who were very Spiritual and replaced it with meaningless filth that has ruined the world. <br>  <br>  Good and evil are cultural concepts and in order for something to be "evil" one must give it power.|`|QlB3VXWraa	I doubt that you've seen witchcraft work but I suggest you set up some controlled experiments to prove it. If you're successful you'll be the first human to manage it. You'll be more famous than Einstein and richer than Oprah.<br>  <br>  But your question involves the age old debate over competing superstitions. Should you go with one or t'other or a blend of both? In my opinion no superstition can be more valid than another but if you have evidence to the contrary I'd be delighted to see it.|`|jsM8F4bLaa	Kevin, she said WITCHCRAFT, you know, where the bible says "I suffer not a witch to live". <br>  <br>  That Witchcraft.<br>  <br>  edit: Ok then, I believe in revelation somewhere it says that all other gods are demons that are worshipped. And witchcraft worships a demon. Or that time that Paul cast out that spirit of divination, the girl was telling the truth about Paul but still, it's demonic. ^_^|`|iuoB7pf0aa	Yes, totally. If you knew what the Bible said about these things you'd know that it's wrong. You're relying on something other than Jesus and you know it's wrong. You KNOW it's wrong or you wouldn't have asked it and let me tell you something: It's not worth compromising Jesus for witchcraft. It's best to stay out of it especially if you know what's good for you. <br>  <br>  Another thing is that satan has been using the trick of witchcraft for centuries to get souls. Don't fall for this obvious trick. If you do, you're a fool.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	you dont have any belief in Christ if you practice witchcraft|`|tpDICzslaa	From the Catholic catechism:<br>  <br>  2115 God can reveal the future to his prophets or to other saints. Still, a sound Christian attitude consists in putting oneself confidently into the hands of Providence for whatever concerns the future, and giving up all unhealthy curiosity about it. Improvidence, however, can constitute a lack of responsibility.<br>  <br>  2116 All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future.48 Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone.<br>  <br>  2117 All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one's service and have a supernatural power over others - even if this were for the sake of restoring their health - are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another's credulity.|`|vmv1rP76aa	If you're a fundamentalist, then yes. If you're a bit more open, then I don't think so. Magick is in all religions and spiritual faiths (whether they admit and accept it or not), just different ways (Christians have prayer and baptism rituals, Wiccans tie to nature, etc...). <br>  <br>  The Bible isn't the only spiritual text out there. Read for yourself and then decide what's right for you. Of course keep an open mind to both sides, since you know what Christians have to say about everyone else who doesn't believe like they do (there's more than enough sites that slander everyone else's faiths and beliefs in the "name of Christ"). <br>  <br>  Just keep an open mind, and do what resonates to you and what YOU know and believe to be true. That's the best way to spirituality.|`|ATKiSyP8aa	Most witchcraft is just like most religions. It requires you to do things that are lifeless and dead. Witchcraft is playing with the dark arts for personal usage which is dangerous because it opens doors for demonic control. People who preform witchcraft would know that they are messing with a polythiestic belief system and thats already in violation with the ten commands. My suggestion is to pray to Yeshua for guidance, and pray for God to lead you with his holy spirit away from those things. I should know after all my mother is a practitioner. Its all a dark delusion, flee from it.|`|R8HruZ8Jaa	The bible clearly states that God does not want us to be involved in wickedness or witchcraft and I personally believe that it is wrong but as long as you are praising God when you are doing it and not opening your mind to other options, because witch craft is not going to get you to heaven, and won't help you either. It tears your mind and spirit away from the One true Love, our Father in heaven. I hope you can see what i am trying to explain. There is one way, and one way only. God's way. God bless, and prayers will be said!<br>  ?|`|tqaLQe86aa	Witchcraft is using the powers that develop with alchemy of the human soul. Its origins are with the original Gods who created humanity and where worshipped before even juadism existed.

He led people into temptation to prove their loyalty was based on innocence and purity. <br>  <br>  The power of prayer is as thought provoking as psychic communication. The mind has many energies and where there is energy, there we find life, communication, contact, interaction etc.<br>  <br>  There is religion and there is Faith. There is spirituality as there is emotion. Life conditions of the human nature and which are like a void to which we seek to find answers. <br>  <br>  Organised religions are no different to politics and usually created in order to control. The Hierarchy and the person at the top. The greatest of all puppet Masters.<br>  <br>  All doctrine available to Mankind are preached, perceived, prophesied by Humans. Moral Values designed to control. The only person in charge of your life is YOU! Whatever path you wish to follow to evolve spiritually depends on your perception of Truth. Since life is eternal, we may not remember the causes of our past, all we have is the here and now, which is why the best policy is to live in the present moment to the best of your ability and without any regrets.|`|B958U2ctaa	First off, witchcraft never held ties to satanism. One cannot worship something they do not even believe in, and witches do not believe in satan. Therefore there are no ties between witchcraft and satanism.<br>  <br>  As for witchcraft and evil... Well, most witches follow a moral code consisting of bringing no harm to others and that everything they do comes back to them times three. Common sense would show that witches are therefore far more likely to be 'good' than 'evil'. However, it does depend on the witch. Some do things that could be considered evil, but most do not. The majority of witches are more concerned with positive acts.<br>  <br>  As for compromising your belief in Christ, no you're not. Many witches believe in Christ. However, just because they believe in Christ does not mean they worship Christ.<br>  <br>  If you are considering witchcraft as a spiritual path, remember this: witchcraft is not a path for everyone. It is not a game, it is a very serious choice. However, if you feel it is for you, start slowly. Learn the facts before you begin your practice. If you can find a teacher, do so. Above all, if something feels wrong to you, do not do it. Listen to your heart and your instincts.|`|I5Dl6kMWaa	yes are compromising your belief in Jesus Christ. The devil is very crafty and deceitful, he does have powers. The devil has designed his kingdom to mirror that of the almighty kingdom of our Lord God Jehovah. Witchcraft believes in calling on dark forces (and in years of this century and last , they now call some of their powers from light forces in an attempt to sound less dark and evil...i.e good magic/dark magic, or light magic/dark magic). Let me be clear their is no pure form of witchcraft it is not of God. If you read your bible,(read about Simon the magician in Acts), the bible refers to magic (later translated as witchcraft) as evil and needing repentance from the participants who perform it. You are right there is a lot to the spiritual world, the bible tells us so, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but  against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." Ephesians 6:12, but i suggest if you want to understand the spiritual realm as God desires, than you should stick to the bible and its teachings. I can go on and on about this but am limited in this forum, so I just hope you get enough to start research on why you shouldn't get into witchcraft... I posted a link below about Simon the magician in the bible, and also a link about what the bible says about the occult (witchcraft, spells, sorcery, etc)<br>  I pray you stay steadfast in Him,<br>  God Bless<br>  Yvicks|`|P6P3oUgdaa	Well, the bible does say things like 'thou shalt not suffer a witch to live', but i think that's OT. (not that that matters much) <br>  So, surely from a scriptural perspective you compromise your christianity.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion, they're both imaginary...<br>  <br>  Out of curiosity, you've seen witchcraft work?<br>  If i had seen that, i'd more doubt my senses then believe what i saw... but hey, that's just me...<br>  <br>  Still curious, what do you think you 'witnessed'|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Since Jesus Christ is your Lord & Savior, I suggest you get on your knees in your prayer closet & ask Jesus in prayer.<br>  <br>  Then you can choose to obey or disobey Him more clearly. The Holy Spirit will bring to mind biblical scripture.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is going after unholy spirits. So it's idolatry. And the Lord will turn you over to the witches if you do this. (Godly discipline.) I know from experience. So? I suggest you don't do this. Believe me, you will come crawling back to Jesus, humiliated.<br>  <br>  Witchcraft is just consulting with worldly dark spiritual powers (demons). So? God tells us not to talk to these for a reason. The oiji board itself is taboo.

8d8ejHPfaa	Hi Curly,<br>  Do you have the right to your own spiritual beliefs?  Yes, you do. <br>  Is it easy at your age to deal with parents who want to raise you according to their  beliefs, if you don't share them? No.<br>  Is it common at your age to question whether God even exists, let alone how you want to go about understanding Him or Her?  Yes.<br>  I was raised Catholic, and when I got into my teenage years I started to question the things I was being taught, a lot of it didn't ring true for me, but I still had to go to church and stuff.  I finally did quit practicing when I was 17, and fortunately they have never bothered me about it.  There's a lot of things that go into it, partly a desire to sort out your own thoughts, and partly rebellion.  But that's ok, it's healthy, it's part of growing up and defining yourself as a person independent of your parents, and beginning to form your own life apart from them. Rejecting thier beliefs is part of trying to figure out for yourself who you are, and what you want to be in your adult life.  Have you told them that you would rather not participate in that anymore?  If you have, and they still insist, well, try to keep a couple things in mind.  No matter what they are teaching you, no one can ever really tell you what to keep in your own heart.  Try to keep in mind that as parents, they have the responisibility of seeing to your ethical and moral development, to send you out into the world as someone who is going to live a good life once you leave thier care, and taking you to church is part of thier understanding how to go about doing it.  It won't be very long before you do leave thier care, it might be a drag to put up with it when it's not the way you really feel, but it won't be forever.  When you get older, you might even appreciate some of the things they are teaching you now a bit more.  You will be an adult soon, and once you leave the house you can do whatever you want about that, in the meantime, if you want to explore other ideas or even atheism as an idea, you have a whole www in front of you to explore, and contemplate in your private thoughts about it.  Try to look at what your parents are presenting to you as part of your heritage, and also try to look at what they are presenting to you as one building block in what will ultimately become your spiritual life (or lack thereof) over the course of your lifetime, part of a foundation to build on as you go on to find out who you really are spiritually...

97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	Excommunication is more often a result of unwillingness to repent - or commission of felonies which demand time in prison.<br>  <br>  I don't know that I can answer for a 'typical Mormon teen' - I can speak to my own experiences, and those of my sons.  I did not smoke, drink nor date before I turned 16.  I kept myself morally clean and was a virgin when I married.  My sons do not smoke, nor drink.  They avoid porn.  The one who is over 16 is very selective about dating - only going out in groups to avoid temptation or even the romantic entanglements of pairing off.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	Caffeine is not banned.

They get together and play creative games, go on activities, do things together, etc.  <br>  <br>  As for "ex communicable offenses", I think they'd have to be imprisoned, commit a felony, ask to be removed from the church, kill someone, etc.  It's really rare for a teenager to get excommunicated.  While those things are very serious sins, excommunication is not something that happens frequently for teenagers. More often than not they'd be asked not to participate in the sacrament, asked to read "The Miracle of Forgiveness", &/or possibly disfellowshiped.|`|BMQlzUkfaa	Mormon teenagers like and do the same things that other teens do as long as those things are good and uplifting.

I don't think that would lead to having your church membership taken away.  Excommunication is usually reserved for worse sins or serious rebelliousness against the church.  <br>  <br>  How bad does it have to be?  The first thing that comes to mind is adultery.  I've also seen people excommunicated because they were affiliating with anti-LDS groups and weren't repentant of it, in fact, they were downright "rebellious" towards the church and it's leadership.<br>  <br>  The link below is a pamphlet that talks about the standards that are expected of the youth of the church.

LDS (or Mormon) members have many guidelines to follow. They may seem like restrictions of sorts but they are there for guidance. We are not supposed to date until 16, no smoking, no drugs, no alcohol. As the scriptures say, our body is our temple, a dwelling place for the Holy Spirit. The Spirit cannot dwell within us if there are unclean thoughts or things in our body. It is not official church doctrine that we cannot drink caffeine, but many members abstain from partaking it because it can be harmful. Carbonated drinks have acids in it that can cause harm to your stomach and other organs. To neutralize this acid, it will take calcium from your bones. Caffeine is also habit forming. You cannot get excommunicated for not listening to this. You may not be able to attend the temple (the house of the Lord) but you will not be shunned. These are guidelines to help us be closer to our Lord. They are guidelines that do protect us in our daily lives.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Mormon teenagers are pretty much like all teenagers, though there are a few minor differences, yes. <br>  <br>  First of all, caffeine IS allowed.  Mormons have simply been asked to refrain from tobacco products, alcohol, tea, and coffee...which also means that a Mormon teen living according to their faith won't be found vomiting into the bushes at a party.  <br>  <br>  We also don't believe in sex outside of marriage, which does mean that most Mormon teens won't be sleeping around or getting pregnant or dealing with STD's.  <br>  <br>  Um...we don't watch movies with an R rating, but anything else is fair game.<br>  <br>  Oh, and many Mormon teens attend a scripture study class (called seminary) either in the morning before school or, in Utah and Idaho, during school hours as an elective.  They also tend to be more involved in the Scouting program and usually have youth group activities on a Tuesday or Wednesday each week.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, though, they're pretty much the same.  The teenage boys do stupid things, the teenage girls roll their eyes at the boys but are secretly amused, and all of them go on dates and pretend to study for tests and get stressed out over acne.  American teenagers, at least, are the same everywhere.<br>  <br>  As for crossing the line...no, these aren't things over which a person would be excommunicated.  A sin has to be pretty dang bad for that, and while sleeping around or getting drunk all the time is hardly a good idea and is viewed very seriously, it's not excommunication-worthy.  I really can't seen most teenagers doing anything that would get them excommunicated at all, in fact.|`|TD7OFIDIaa	Mormon people are asked everyday...<br>  Is it hard to be a mormon? It really isn't,because you can't drink coffee, you can't do, at least most things people do, because then they say you made a sin and so on...<br>  But the people that do get excommunicated are people who do the wrong things... They sometimes are Teenagers, but that is if they choice to do bad things, you can't get excommunicated cause of drinking coffee or drinking or smoking, but its things that are Very serious such as <br>  Taking a another persons life.<br>  <br>  Mormon teenagers, are allowed to do good things that influences them to do good to others such as Helping and Caring for people in a good way, Things to help them gain Testimony, faith, Confidence ETC.<br>  But things you do is up to You, Mormons can't pin point what you did or control and guide you step by step saying you can do this or that, but if you do this then this will happen, <br>  Its up to you if you feel you want to do it or not.<br>  In the Mormon Church you have this thing called the " Holy Ghost"<br>  It helps you decide what things are good or bad, It is kinda like a Emotion thing, it isn't like you see the ghost, or it tells you step by step what to do, so it isn't something do be scared of, or anything scary, It just helps you through your life knowing Good from Evil.|`|VszsJjruaa	Mormon teenagers can do whatever they want to do, just like every other human being.  If they choose to live their religion then the LDS Church does have a health code that says no to alcohol, tobacco, coffee, tea, and harmful drugs.  Caffeine is not necessarily part of that, but because of the coffee people often think thats what it is.<br>  <br>  Other things Mormon/LDS teens shouldn't do are what you would expect of a christian teenager, ie no sex (and typically don't start dating until they're 16).  A teenager usually won't get excommunicated for most any sin they commit, as they're still young and haven't progress too far in the church. But there are other "punishments" that would restrict them from how much they can participate in church that is intended to help them repent.<br>  <br>  Basically, as others have said, they're just normal teens and like normal things.  Its all about free choice - people of any religion should be able to make decisions as they wish whether for their good or not.  Teenagers can be dumb and short-sighted, though, so a church and good friends, parents, and church leaders can be a great thing to have.|`|AcTIL6axaa	This is what Mormon teens are supposed to follow, well all of us really, but this was written for the youth of the church - <a href="http://www.lds.org/youthresources/pdf/ForStrengYouth36550.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.lds.org/youthresources/pdf/Fo...</a><br>  <br>  Sadly, some LDS teens don't follow the standards of the church.

At school he acts pretty normal, he curses and makes dirty jokes and doesn't seem to take his religion to seriously. But I hear that his parents are crazy. He rarely gets to go out with friends, and you REALLY have to watch your mouth and behaviour around his parents. In middle school, they pulled him out and homeschooled him for a while after realizing how truly heathenistic his friends Dylan and Jehn were.|`|15Wav0Alaa	Well I grew up mormon and I think that I am pretty normal. My parents and my siblings are all active in the church, however I still go to parties, I just chose not to drink. I hang out will non members and have never had a hard time with my parents worring about trouble that I would get into becuase they trusted me. <br>  <br>  In order to be excommunicated you really have to do something that would effect your standing in the church. I have known men who have had affairs, drank and have done drugs. None of them have been kicked out. As punishment they are unable to take the sacrament which means that they are not able to take in the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Repentance through Jesus Christ is the only way to be forgiven of your sins, so in other words the offenders have to hold on to their sins until the bishop decides that they have payed for their transgression.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of anyone being kicked out of my church, but I know what some of the reasons are. There are very few sins which mandate excommunication to begin the process of repentance. Gross iniquity can qualify a person for excommunication. "Gross iniquity" could include "murder, adultery, sexual perversion, or any serious offense against society that has resulted in conviction by the civil courts. A good example would be a major criminal charge."5 The practice of or advocacy of polygamy qualifies a person for excommunication from the Church. Apostasy can also result in excommunication. Apostasy is not inactivity in Church programs. A person who drifts away and becomes inactive is not apostate. Apostasy involves will-full rebellion, overt criticism of the Church, fighting against the Church. <br>  <br>  It must be understood that the object of excommunication is not to get rid of a person who has committed transgression, but to begin the process of repentance: <br>  <br>  When excommunication from the Church is necessary...we must not regard the penalty as an end to all blessings and eternal possibilities. Even excommunication, serious as it is, can have the effect of restoring the proper perspective of the offender. Once deprived of Church membership, it is interesting to note how vitally important rebaptism becomes. The truly repentant excommunicated person will strive diligently to regain the waters of baptism. In the Church there are scores of members who have earned their way back into the Church through true repentance and who now stand on more firm ground than ever before in their lives. They have learned their lesson well. They are not likely to make the same mistake again; and surely the blessings of eternity are once again a possibility, thanks to the sanctifying influence of true repentance coupled with the miracle of forgiveness.6 <br>  Excommunication need not be the end of all hope. Although the mistake has been grievous and a serious violation of God’s commandments, a person who really loves the Lord and has the desire and the fortitude to now do right can most often reestablish his life and in due process and time may possibly qualify himself for the lofty and ultimate blessings of exaltation.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

The guy is straight, he knows that i'm gay and he's cool with it. he even says sometimes that i am his best friend. the problem is, i know that he is straight and that nothing will ever happens between us. but i still have a crush on him. sometimes it just breaks my heart to like someone  that much and cannot express my feelings for him and I don't want to do anything to jeopardize my friendship with him.i've never felt something so strong for anyone before and it's just killing me.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	Idk.

It's annoying answering the same question over and over. maybe it's because i support gays so much. oh well.|`|X1j7qYkUaa	I think some of those crushes tend to remain, regardless of what the reality is or your intellectual desires. <br>  <br>  Beat off and get over it. Replace him with a new fantasy...  or leave to to fantasy. Or the more comfortable scene, turn it into a joke - where it's still true that you've got a thing for him, but you know there's boundaries and you would rather keep him as a friend...  there's nothing wrong with keeping your personal 'life' active, while still fawning over the one you theoretically can't have. <br>  <br>  "Dude, it's obvious I'm into you... so if you ever want to switch teams, let me be the first. Or if you're hard up for rent next month, maybe we could work out some kind of deal. Anyway, what do you want for dinner tonight, fish or chicken?"<br>  <br>  Or take that down a notch, be his wingman, be his bud... really what's easier for a straight dude, than having a flaming wingman that can handle the bs with chicks he wants to score... no competition for chicks, whether you're playing as straight or you're the non threatening gay dude that can mingle in with the cattle. <br>  <br>  Redefine your relationship, your desire and find another emotional outlet that probably also includes some physical stimulation, visual alternatives and getting laid. Yeah, casual sex can be meaningless but expanding your social circle and conquest options are probably beneficial to maintaining or shifting that uncomfortable edge to your current bromance, and maintaining that bromance by becoming something that positively reinforces his perception of your acceptance of his sexuality, while still holding to your own ... both of you might need to establish the reasons of why you're friends and what benefits your friendship brings, the give and take scenario that makes all these hardships worthwhile. <br>  <br>  Really, it's redefining, organizing the information that's come out so it's not so heavy... that you like him because you're compatible and your friends; a situation that's often a little more difficult to achieve in the gay scene where often sex comes first and questions of other compatibility comes later.

It is even what some Christan's do.... and what some should do ..<br>  <br>  2. Yes, a parents consent should be approves, because after all they want their children to be properly suited with the right guy.

If they don't believe in islam and make the lie then the woman can easily refute it- if she's a believer she won't lie, if she's also not serious then she can lie back and nothing happens. It's a great psychological method of encouraging people to do the right thing and gives the woman a complete benefit of the doubt.|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	If the husband swears an oath, and the wife swears one back refuting the husband's claim, none will be punished.

Islam did not initiate it, rather, it was something in practice long ago before the advent of Islam. And when Islam came, it tried to eradicate this practice, bit by bit. So it first restricted it to the reciprocal practice of war, in the sense that Muslims took war captives just as the enemies did with Muslims. <br>  <br>  But as it aimed at putting an end to such issue, Islam laid down rules which would eventually lead to eradicating the practice. So it allowed Muslims to have intercourse with slave women taken as captives of just and legitimate wars. In so doing, the woman would automatically become free if she got pregnant. What's more, her child would also become free. <br>  <br>  Not only that, Islam also ordered a Muslim to treat the slave woman in every respect as if she were his wife. She should be well fed, clothed and given due protection. In the family environment, she had the opportunity to learn about Islam and was free to accept it or reject it. She also had the opportunity to earn her freedom for she could be ransomed. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&cid=1119503544596" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satel...</a><br>  <br>  @Edit<br>  <br>  New Testament<br>  <br>  Neither Jesus nor St. Paul, nor any other Biblical figure is recorded as saying anything in opposition to the institution of slavery.<br>  <br>  Matthew 18:25: "But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made."<br>  <br>  Mark 14:66: "And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the high priest:"<br>  <br>  Jesus is recorded as mentioning slaves in one of his parables.

wkQxSnORaa	what happens if an american woman married a spanish man and cheated on him?<br>  what do u think?<br>  u cant answer<br>  <br>  everyone reacts different.<br>  <br>  NOW IF YOUR QUESTION IS WHAT IS ISLAM'S RULING<br>  <br>  Adultery in Islam is one of the most heinous and deadliest of sins. Its enormity can be gauged from the fact that it has often been conjoined in the Qur’an with the gravest of all sins: shirk or associating partners with Allah.<br>  <br>  The enormity of this sin is no small measure due to its dire consequences affecting individuals, families, and societies. Among these are that it entails infidelity and erodes the trust and tranquility that are the foundations of a fulfilling family life; it dissipates one’s energies; it undermines peace at home; it corrodes the purity of one’s soul and hence destroys one’s faith; finally, it exposes the person to the wrath of Allah, thus resulting in eternal damnation.<br>  <br>  It is no wonder then that Allah and His Messenger have sounded dire warnings against adultery in so many ways. To list only a few instances:<br>  <br>  Allah says in the Qur’an, (And come not near unto adultery. Lo! it is an abomination and an evil way) (Al-Isra’ 17: 32).<br>  <br>  (And the servants of the Beneficent) are those who do not invoke another god with Allah, and who do not…commit fornication/adultery, for whoever does that shall receive the penalty; for him shall the torment be doubled on the day of resurrection, and therein he shall abide forever, disgraced, save him who repents and believes and does good works; those, Allah shall change their misdeeds into good works. And Allah is Forgiving, Compassionate) (Al-Furqan: 68-70).<br>  <br>  The Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Whoever guarantees me that he will guard his chastity, I will guarantee him Paradise” (Al-Bukhari).|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Forgiveness is not always a two-way street.|`|4Rt7Mm8Aaa	A person has two options:<br>  Continue the marriage<br>  End it<br>  You can't really tell how a person will act in those situations.|`|ILc1XIPraa	If they've both cheated maybe they shouldn't be married any more.

The man, on the other hand, may marry 3 other women and/or have an unlimited number of sex slaves (women captured in battles). So although Islam recognizes male adultery and punishes it to the same extent as that of the female, there is a mentality among Muslims that it isn't really as bad, due to "Allah's" granting of these other avenues for sexual exploits. Theoretically, they can both be given second chances if the matter doesn't reach the Muslim sex police, but actually strictly speaking from a Muslim point of view it is better to turn themselves in to the authorities and face death rather than face "Allah's" punishment in the Hereafter. But if you're looking for "fairness" in Islam anyway, you're barking up the wrong tree.

Danto, the art critic at "The Nation," once described a work of art that gave him a sense of "obscure but inescapable meaning." In other words, while great art doesn't not "hit you over the head" with a simple message, it always gives you a sense that life is not a "tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." It fills you with hope and gives you the strength to carry on, though you cannot define what it is that moves you. Leonard Bernstein once rhapsodized about the effect of Beethoven on him: "Beethoven... turned out the pieces of breath-taking rightness. Rightness, that's the word! Word you get the feeling that whatever note succeeds the last is the only possible note that can rightly happen at that instant, in that context, then chances are you're listening to Beethoven. Melodies,fugues, rhythms. Leave them to the Tchaikovskys and Hindemiths and Ravels. Our boy has the real goods, the stuff from Heaven, the power to make you feel at the finish: Something is right in the world. There is something that checks throughput, that follows its own law consistently: Something we can trust, that will never let us down." If there is no God, and everything in this world is the product of, as Bertrand Russell famously put it, an accidental collocation of atoms, then there is no actual purpose of accidental natural forces, then what we call beauty is nothing but a neurological hardwired response to particular data. You only find certain scenery to be beautiful because you had ancestors who knew you would find food there and they survive because of that neurological feature and now we have too. In analogy, though music feels significant, that significance is an illusion. Love too must be seen in this light. If we are the result of blind natural forces, then what we call love is simply a biochemical response, inherited from ancestors who survived because this trait helped them survive. Berstein and Danto are testifying to the fact that even though we as secular people that beauty and love are just biochemical responses, in the presence of great art and beauty we inescapably feel there is truth and justice that will never let us down, and love means everything. Notice that Bernstein, though by no means an orthodox religious person, can't refrain from even using the term Heaven when talking about Beethoven. We may therefore, be secular materialist who believe truth and justice, good and evil, are complete illusions. But in the presence of art or even great natural beauty, out hearts tell us another story. Another prominent artist who is apparently telling us the same thing is John Updike. In his short story "Pigeon Feathers" a young teenager says to his mother, "Don't you see, if when we die there's nothing, all your sun and fields and what are all, ah, horror? It's just an ocean of horror." Later, in the presence of the beauty of pigeons feathers, of their texture and color, he is overwhelmed by a certainty that there is a God behind the world who will allow him to live for eternity. Updike seems to be saying that regardless of the beliefs of our mind the random meaninglessness of life, before the face of beauty we know better. "So what?" Someone might object. "Jest because we feel something it true doesn't make it so!" Are we, however, only talking about feelings here? What is evoked in these experiences is, more accurately, appetite or desire. Goethe refers to this as blessed longing. We not only feel the reality but also the absence of what we long for. St. Augustine in his "Confessions" reasoned that these unfulfillable desires are clues to the reality of God. How so? Indeed, as it was objected, just because we feel the desire for a steak dinner doesn't mean we will get it. However, while we hunger doesn't prove that the particular meal desired will be procured, doesn't the appetite for food in us mean that food exist? Isn't true that innate desires correspond to real objects that can satisfy them, such as sexual desire corresponding to sex, physical appetite corresponding to food, tiredness corresponding to sleep, and relational desires corresponding to friendship? Doesn't the unfulfillable longing by beauty qualify as an innate desire? We have a longing for joy, love, and beauty that no amount or quality of food, sex, friendship, successes can satisfy. We want something that nothing in this world can fulfill. Isn't that at least a clue that this something that we want to exist? This unfulfillable longing, then, qualifies as a deep, innate human desire, and that makes it a major clue that God is there.|`|AA10317644	The universe is finite. Therefore, it had a beginning.

No one knew about it, and I lied to everyone about the way I was feeling. One of the reasons I started becoming depressed was because I felt God never answered me. You see, I come from a Charismatic Catholic church, and so we believe in speaking in tongues and getting slain in the spirit and all that stuff. I'm in a Confirmation class, and sometimes we have praise and worship meetings. At these meetings, there would be tons of kids(as in maybe like ten or so. I've noticed that as time has passed it has happened to more and more kids). Btw, they were definitely not faking it you can definitely tell. I asked Jesus and the Holy Spirit to do this with me, but they never did. Then one day, in Confirmation class, I was in my small group. At the end, our small group leader told us that when we went to bed at night we should pray to God, and ask him to speak to us. And she said to wait awhile, too and not to just give up if we didn't hear anything right away. So that night it was like one or two in the morning and I suddenly remembered what our small group leader had told us. I didn't want to, and was just kinda like "its too late and I'm too tired right now". But I eventually decided to try it. I laid down on my stomach, closed my eyes, and repeated the word of Samuel in the Bible "speak Lord, for your servant is listening". I didn't hear anything for awhile, and kept getting distracted. After awhile, I felt like giving up. But something told me to just wait a little longer and not to give up so easily. I waited a little bit longer and then,in the depths of my heart, I heard Jesus speak to me. He told me that He had a plan for my life, and it was more awesome and amazing than I could even imagine. He told me that I needed to trust Him more, because He loved me, and He wouldn't have put me on the Earth if He didn't have an amazing and awesome plan for my life. After this incident, I tried praying more, and Jesus has said other things to me that have helped me. But I still struggled to completely trust in Him. After I started praying more, I stopped being depressed. I know this sounds crazy, but Jesus healed me. I had been displaying all the classic symptoms of depression:Suicidal thoughts, lack of motivation, irritability, crying alot, and i mean alot, also, things that used to interest me didn't anymore and I didn't get as much enjoyment out of things as other seemed to. A week or so after this, I was at a Lifeteen Tuesday night prayer meeting. The Lifeteen prayer meetings are different from the Confirmation one because Lifeteen meetings are for kids grades 7-highschool, but I've seen some college kids. Confirmation praise and worship is only for seventh graders preparing to receive the Sacrament of Confirmation. So at the prayer meeting that night, I was being prayed over in tongues by a couple of girls(at the lifeteen prayer meetings, they have a Core Team, which is made up of young adults who pray over the teens and talk to them and stuff). Being prayed over in tongues is an awesome experience, and you can really feel the Holy Spirit. When they were done, one of the girls told me that when she was praying over me, she felt like God wanted me to have more Hope(in our Catholic definition for the virtue of Hope, it includes "trusting in god") and that God had plan, and He wanted me to Hope in him more, and trust in Him. I was so happy, that was so awesome and I was so thankful to God. God has also done other things for me. For example, once before a lifeteen praise and worship session, there was adoration going on in the church. Adoration is when there is a consecrated Host put in a monstrance(you could look up pics or something of them on Google if you don't know what they look like). We believe that the Consecrated Host is Jesus and there have been tons of miracles where the Host has actually turned into flesh. Read the book Eucharistic Miracles by Joan Carroll Cruz. So I thought the Consecrated host was in the monstrance, but it actually wasn't. I started praying to Jesus, thinking He was in it. After a little bit, I stopped. It just didn't feel the same when I was praying right then, as it always did when Jesus was in the monstrance(they have a glass part so you can see Jesus, but the monstrance was turned at an angle where I couldn't see in). I felt like I was just looking at and praying to an object. I began to wonder if the host was in there or not. I became pretty sure that it was not after a couple minutes. Later on, someone came and Put the host from the Tabernacle in the Church, into the monstrance. I started praying, and during my prayer I said "Jesus, I truly believe you are present there in the Eucharist. As soon as I said this, I got what is called the gift of tears. It is Charismatic, and usually happens in church or in a praise and worship session or something. You basically start suddenly crying out of the blue. Its not like your sad or anything.

There are some people in Pakistan looking for you!  They want to fight too!<br>  <br>  Psychologically, homosexuality can be explained as a problem in the psychological development of the personality very early in life and throughout their youth.  It's a problem of failed initial attachment (by perceived rejection or real, and subsequent poor self-esteem and self-image as it relates to the same gender parent) to the parent of the same gender around age 2-6, then re-attachment and association with the parent of the same gender in an abnormal way.  It's not considered a psych. disorder anymore because it has to cause significant mental distress to the patient to qualify as one.  Some people are perfectly happy with being gay.  It's not a sin - but I don't believe in sins or all this "God" stuff either.

Greater love has not a man than he that lay down his life for another.  God is holy and pure; he hates all sin including lying, stealing, adultery, murder, and sexual immorality all the same.  If we've broken the law at just one point, we are guilty of breaking the entire law.  All of us have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.  That's why we need Jesus.  None of us are without sin.  The Bible says in both the Old and New testament that homosexuality is a sin.  Romans 1:21-27; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11.  But God doesn't hate fags; he loves them so much that he sent Christ to bore their sins on the cross.  The question for all of us; what will we do about Jesus?

In fact, all that crap against homosexuality in the old testament is just written by MEN, not God. These men were a product of their times, when procreation was the only way to make your tribe prosper so not having children (being gay) was considered a sin because without new people in your tribe to work as soldiers and farmers, it would soon die out to other more populated tribes. Likewise in the new testament. Paul wrote the anti-gay stuff, not Jesus, and Paul was a typical Jew who believed in everything in the Torah and there is some possibility he was a self-hating *** himself, according to the line in one of his letters where he says "I want to do things that I hate, my body wants to do things that are against nature" those aren't the exact words, but if you look it up in his letters, it goes something like that.

h6NqNzHAaa	My first question would be how do they know you got a raise? That should be private information because it often causes problems in the workplace. If you boss told them then that is completely unprofessional and I would discuss it with them immediately detailing the problems you are having. If you told them, then you have to ask yourself why you would pass that kind of information on knowing it would cause strained relationships.<br>  <br>  Keep the cookies coming!|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	You should not have gotten a raise because you bring 'goodies' to work.  You should get one for your performance at work.  If your raise was due to the food you bring to work, your co-workers have every right to be upset.|`|gT9k3Z43aa	If you didn't get a raise for your performance at work, then your co-workers are right for resenting you.

I have a healthy respect for Edhi. He and his wife have done alot of Good for the Pakistani people without the Political entanglements.<br>  It's pathetic that a man would be treated as such. I wonder if they question other aid workers that travel often?
s2aCNJOBaa	Yes, USA tax payers do have the legal right to speak up about the improper use of Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and need to speak up about the improper use of Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<br>  <br>  If I ever suspect that someone has faked their Disability and/or illegally have gotten onto Supplemental Security Income (SSI), I WILL report the person to the Social Security Administration Fraud Investigation Division.<br>  <br>  The way I see it, any person who is illegally on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) is stealing money from the USA Federal Government and is also stealing needed funds from legitimate medically-legally recognized Disabled PWDs and needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  <br>  <br>  Me and only child are legitimate medically-legally recognized congenitally Disabled PWDs at the local, state, and federal levels and by the Social Security Administration (SSA). Me and my only child has suffered greatly in various ways due to the fact that we are Disabled PWDs. <br>  <br>  Since me and my child are Disabled PWDs and I am a Disability Rights Activist-Advocate-Self Advocate, I feel like it is my obligation and my moral duty to report any person who is illegally on Supplemental Security Income (SSI). I can not and will not stand by and do nothing knowing that a person is illegally on Supplemental Security Income (SSI).<br>  <br>  If a person has a MILD Disability and they ARE perceived as a Non-Disabled person by mainstream society, the person should NOT be eligible and NOT qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Me and child can NOT pass as Non-PWDs and can NOT pass as Non-Disabled persons in mainstream society.<br>  <br>  The person that you are talking about, based on the person's statements about their MILD Disabilities, the person should NOT be eligible and NOT qualify for Supplemental Security Income (SSI).|`|BevylvVSaa	They not only have the right - they have the obligation.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	You can report it and they will do an investigation.<br>  <br>  Though all government hand out programs are unconstitutional.  The government is not supposed to give out the peoples money without getting a service in return.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	If someone is getting SSI for a mild impairment, they must have lied on their forms, and you are right to report them for fraud. HOWEVER you must be pretty sure about your info. I have very severe bipolar disorder, and nobody outside my home can tell because I don't get psychosis from it. If someone investigated me for fraud, it would tear me apart, and could drive me to suicide, because I can't udnerstand myself why I can't do things, I am just a mess for no reason I can understand and am completely unstable. Many people with disabilities are hiding them.  They may have mental illnesses, or lots of seizures etc. that you haven't observed.<br>  <br>  Fraud cases that you are aware are fraud, though, should be reported.<br>  <br>  You have to watch it on the "those other people are less disabled than I am, and I can work, and look, they are on disability" Some of them maybe could have tried harder, but others have other problems like were sexually abused, have depression, have a lower IQ than you, had fewer educational opportunities than you, have low self esteem (were always told all they could do was take money in a parking garage), just mentally do not have as good of coping skills, etc.  The wheelchair or deafness are just the OBVIOUS problems.<br>  <br>  Most people with mild disabilities do themselves a disservice when they go on SSA/SSI, and they are also defrauding the government. It is so hard to get disability, that I think there are not very many cheaters. As for discrimination, I am fat, and I'm sure I didn't get hired sometimes because of that.  Other people are black, and don't get hired for that. Or they are in their 60's.  It's wonderful to be an attractive, tall, white man in his 30's or 40's, but just because you aren't, doesn't mean you belong on disability. If there really are people like you say, that is disturbing. But everyone I know on disability is really, really impaired, and many people I know who should be on disability, are not, because they do not know they have severe mental illness (called lack of insight).<br>  <br>  I think you should pat yourself on the back for keeping your chin up, and keeping putting yourself out there, and worry less about what other people do. Most people on disability do have a serious impairment, don't focus on the cheaters.  I mean, come on, who wants to live on $600 a month?
ncdTxID9aa	Yes <br>  <br>  <br>  Gold Diggers want the finer things in life.  Even if she falls for the guy who can lavish her, one of her intentions was to indulge in some one else's riches.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A woman who seeks security needs to be able to secure herself, because a strong man may be that, but where's the independence if he were gone?  He could be wealthy, an average Joe, poor, or successful.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Thanks, lol I'm not violent|`|dmCyY2SKaa	It's like the difference between a cute girl and Adriana Lima. Most men want to be with an attractive, pretty woman, but to insist on someone like Adriana Lima is greedy. Gold diggers are the same way, they want what most people want just a lot of it. They think they are entitled to it.<br>  <br>  Women pride themselves on being independent but even the most independent women like the idea of having a man around who can provide security if need be. It's a cavewoman thing in my opinion.|`|aTZF7ey7aa	The difference between a gold digger and a person seeks sercurity, 1 a gold digger  will steal everything possible from a person sort of bleed them dry and never use there money etc to help half way with the man or woman and then when they have done that they have no feelings and dump you and start on another person.<br>  2 A person who seeks sercurity, wants reassurrance that they will be well provided and looked after, without the fear of being less defenceless or pennyless..|`|nlKZRNqmaa	I think it is similar.. but no the same. A gold digger is strictly money money money.. getting what they want. Security seeker..well it doesn't mean they are looking for the best things in life and they wanna make sure they are taken care of for the rest of their life....|`|LNd0tPGkaa	you are an idiot|`|3m00lxxuaa	If the one that is seeking security sees security as being defined by the man being rich, then there isn't much difference there but maybe the security seeker is more likely to stick around, and not screw the guy over. That being said, there is more to it than just security.

5vA7kkeyaa	about five years ago|`|AA10624860	The Quran is perfect.<br>  <br>  No questioning...no doubting... NOTHING<br>  <br>  P-E-R-F-E-C-T<br>  <br>  And I challenge you to give me one example otherwise...<br>  <br>  The way of life presented in the Quran would put an end to world hunger(Zakat), wars, and reduce crime to virtual non-existence(Shariah)..there are many scientific miracles and prophesies fulfilled (www.quranmiracles.com), and no contradictions or factually incorrect points...I guess that's what I expected from God's word.|`|WmU7jhObaa	lol Rashad Khalifah is a Dajjal. look how the Submitter response.<br>  <br>  Rashad Khalifah<br>  "Follow me and not the prophets"<br>  "It is considered Shirk to mention any prophets name in prayer"<br>  <br>  he is as stupid as Shias and Shias are pretty stupid|`|xBfPUGqyaa	i decided years ago to follow the book of Quran, which posses no systematic corruption as your proposed question claims|`|v93T1z2Aaa	Well Muslims have something that offers the clearest proof of all - The Holy Quran. There is no other book like it anywhere on earth. It is absolutely perfect in the Arabic language. It has no mistakes in grammar, meanings or context. The scientific evidences are well known around the entire world, even amongst non-Muslim scholars. Predictions in the Quran have come true; and its teachings are clearly for all people, all places and all times.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly enough, the Quran itself provides us with the test of authenticity and offers challenges against itself to prove its veracity. Allah tells us in the Quran:<br>  <br>   Haven't the unbelievers considered if this was from other than Allah, they would find within it many contradictions? <br>  <br>  Another amazing challenge from Allah's Book:<br>  <br>   If you are in doubt about it, bring a book like it.<br>  <br>  And Allah challenges us with:<br>  <br>   Bring ten chapters like it. <br>  <br>  And finally:<br>  <br>   Bring one chapter like it. <br>  <br>  No one has been able to produce a book like it, nor ten chapters like it, nor even one chapter like it. It was memorized by thousands of people during the lifetime of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and then this memorization was passed down from teacher to student for generation after generation, from mouth to ear and from one nation to another. Today every single Muslim has memorized some part of the Quran in the original Arabic language that it was revealed in over 1,400 years ago, even though most of them are not Arabs. There are over nine million (9,000,000) Muslims living on the earth today who have totally memorized the entire Quran, word for word, and can recite the entire Quran, in Arabic just as Muhammad (peace be upon him) did 14 centuries ago.|`|kCjRaNT2aa	Yeah, just getting my sword ready to go "smite the necks of the unbelievers".

The second verse you mention was one of them.<br>  <br>  However, when God established the "new covenant" that He promised in the Old Testament, there was a higher level that God wanted from us.  Now, we are to love our enemy.

It does have it's place, like the 10 commandments, but verses like that obviously don't hold a place in our world today. <br>  <br>  When Jesus went back to Heaven, He took back with Him the ways of the Old Testament - that verse about witches is in the Old Testament.  This did happen B.C., and it was done. <br>  <br>  People also take the Bible literally - what that verse really means is that they are sinners and will be punished. <br>  <br>  I see how it contradicts itself, but back then sinners where punished with death, and witchcraft was an abomination. Back then it was socially and religiously ok to kill sinners.  With the first coming, Jesus told us that "judgment is mine" meaning He can only judge sinners for their sins.  <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, the Old testament has a lot of information that isn't followed because Jesus came and Christians no longer have to do those things - like killing witches and sacrificing lambs. Thank God, right?

The people who believe in that think that a person comes back from death as another life form or another person.  A person who has a NDE wakes up as the same person.  He/she experiences a view of the afterlife, or they may "see" their body from an outside perspective.  My husband is a police officer who was shot and critically wounded several years ago.  His heart stopped several times during surgery, and he was in a comatose state for nearly three weeks.  He eventually recovered, but he never told anyone what had happened to him during surgery until years later. He said he thought people would think he was crazy.  Finally he told me that he found himself floating near the ceiling of the operating room, and everything looked like he was peering through gauze.  He told me he watched everything the surgeons were doing and he could hear what they were saying during the procedure.  He had never seen the medical records.  When I later obtained those records, what he had told me coincided exactly with what was written. He did not experience seeing a bright light or seeing a heavenly being, but he did have an out-of-body experience.|`|AA11227341	no way--for we are reminded that men will die once and than the day of judgment; Shirley McClain does as a matter of fact she has been around since the start of earth but of course she is not a believer, <br>  Now the idea of near death experience is another matter--my uncle passed away and he said he saw a land full of flowers, that he was so amazed by what he saw and one of the flowers which he had never seen tempted him to cut one to bring to my aunt but just before he cut the flower he heard a voice and it said, "its not your time" he awoke freaked big time and he said he had died and had gone to heaven.

All valid translations will state essentially the same thing; the Major Difference between a "Catholic" Bible and others is that they contain the Apocrypha which most other Bibles do not. Protestants do not view the Apocrypha as "Divine Scripture" because they were not part of the Original Hebrew Canon and because of a lack of consistency within the text.<br>  So, nearly ALL of those listed above have the 66 accepted books of the Bible, with the NJB (New Jerusalem Bible) containing the extra 14 for a total of 80.  The Apocrypha is not in 98% of Bibles due to the reasons aforementioned.

I think they prefer the KJV. Our Catholic bible has 7 OT books the reformers decided to reject. Their OT is taken from the Phariseean canon the Jews came up with in the 2nd cent. Ours is the septuagint, the same scriptures that Christ and the Apostles read, taught from and studied. The bible is a Catholic book, edited in the mid 4th cent. by a council of approx. 400 Catholic bishops. It was translated by St Jerome from the original Greek, Aramaic, Hebrew and Syriac languages. He put the chosen manuscripts into the Latin Vulgate, the common language of the empire. This is still the official bible of the Church, altho we have translated it into the modern languages of the world. St Jerome was centuries closer to those ancient languages, and he was fluent in them all. His work is bound to be more accurate than any modern scholars efforts.

bmoCpcdraa	Shoshone interpreter, member of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Born around 1788. Much about Sacagawea, the only woman on the Lewis and Clark expedition into the American West, is a mystery. Daughter of a Shoshone chief, it is not known exactly when she was born. Some sources say 1788 while others say 1787 and 1786. Around the age of 12, Sacagawea was captured by Hidatsa Indians, an enemy of the Shoshones. She was then sold to a French-Canadian trapper named Toussaint Charbonneau who made her one of his wives.<br>  <br>  Sacagawea and her husband lived among the Hidatsa and Mandan Indians in the upper Missouri River area (present-day North Dakota). In November 1804, an expedition led by Meriwether Lewis and William Clark entered the area. Often called the Corps of Discovery, the expedition planned to explore newly acquired western lands and find a route to the Pacific Ocean. The group built Fort Mandan, and elected to stay there for the winter. Lewis and Clark met Charbonneau and quickly hired him to serve as interpreter on their expedition. Even though she was pregnant with her first child, Sacagawea was chosen to accompany them on their mission. Lewis and Clark believed that her knowledge of the Shoshone language would help them later in their journey.<br>  <br>  In February 1805, Sacagawea gave birth to a son named Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. Despite traveling with a newborn child during the trek, Sacagawea proved to be helpful in many ways. She was skilled at finding edible plants. When a boat she was riding on capsized, she was able to save some of its cargo, including important documents and supplies. She also served as a symbol of peace—a group traveling with a woman and a child were treated with less suspicion than a group of men alone.<br>  <br>  Sacagawea also made a miraculous discovery of her own during the trip west. When the corps encountered a group of Shoshone Indians, she soon realized that its leader was actually her brother Cameahwait. It was through her that the expedition was able to buy horses from the Shoshone to cross the Rocky Mountains. Despite this joyous family reunion, Sacagawea remained with the explorers for the trip west.<br>  <br>  After reaching the Pacific coast in November 1805, Sacagawea was allowed to cast her vote along with the other members of the expedition for where they would build a fort to stay for the winter. They built Fort Clatsop near present-day Astoria, Oregon, and they remained there until March of the following year. Sacagawea, her husband, and her son remained with the expedition on the return trip east until they reached the Mandan villages. During the journey, Clark had become fond of her son Jean Baptiste, nicknaming him “Pomp” or “Pompey.” And he even offered to help him get an education.<br>  <br>  Once Sacagawea left the expedition, the details of her life become more elusive. In 1809, it is believed that she and her husband—or just her husband according to some accounts—traveled with their son to St. Louis to see Clark. Pomp was left in Clark’s care. Sacagawea gave birth to her second child, a daughter named Lisette, three years later. Only a few months after her daughter’s arrival, she reportedly died at Fort Manuel in what is now South Dakota in 1812. (There were stories that it was another wife of Charbonneau who died at Fort Manuel, but historians don’t give much credence to this.) After Sacagawea’s death, Clark looked after her two children, and ultimately took custody of them both.<br>  <br>  Over the years, tributes to Sacagawea and her contribution to the Corps of Discovery have come in many forms, such as statues, place-names, and she was even featured on a dollar coin issued in 2000 by the U.S. Mint|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	yeah probably<br>  maybe pocahontas, she eve had a movie<br>  but i dont really know all that much about them both

To say we attack them is like saying a burglar was "attacked" when he entered a home and tried to rape someone.  Their version of "disagree" with Christian values is if someone says, "Fine, but don't force me to live by them."  They take that as an attack?  Please!<br>  <br>  By the way, reparative therapy for gays is not only discouraged by mental health professionals across the board, it has an abysmal suicide rate, perfect for all those teenagers whose parents can't love them if they're gay.

They completely undermine the legal limitations purposefully placed on nonprofits.<br>  <br>  They are THE major political action group (PAC) that religious 510 (c) (3)s like the LDS Church and many Baptist churches use to affect faith-based legislation.  How?  By giving Focus on the Family millions of dollars, of course.<br>  <br>  A violation of a religious organization's 501 (c) (3) nonprofit status?  Probably.  I'd be curious to see how something like this would play out in court.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Surprise, surprise, Gov. Sarah Palin is a MAJOR supporter of Focus on the Family.

It's very frightening, their vision of America. Doesn't really sound like the America I was brought up in, or an America I'd want my kids to grow up in... <br>  <br>  What's most unfortunate is that people who haven't done their homework could possibly be of the opinion (like people posting before me) "What's so bad about a group that promotes morality?".  <br>  Morality means something different to everyone, and I certainly don't appreciate groups trying to influence the government to push theirs down my throat.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	I am alarmed for the souls of the false prophet leaders and followers of any large pro-homophobia advocacy group.

These groups are intolerant of beliefs that aren't their own. That is, most Americans (because most Americans aren't really this religious crazy). They're the real anti-Americans.

AA11761261	don't feel embarrassed,it's natural to stumble when you are not speaking your mother language.just remember to slow down a little,it's not necessary to speak fast.<br>  i find it helpful to say words aloud a bunch of times to hear myself and my pronunciation,and writing down words that give you a lot of trouble and pronouncing each word as you write it out.|`|3lPL6pVBaa	I think the best technique is just to slow WAY down when you mess up a word and give your brain a chance to rest.  Just keep talking slowly.  <br>  <br>  Then, when your brain catches up, you can slowly start going faster until you're back up to normal speed.  <br>  <br>  Surprisingly, this actually sounds very normal to people listening because in ordinary speech people speed up and slow down all the time for various reasons, such as in order to emphasize a complicated point.  So people won't even notice that you're using a technique.

2LJV50vhaa	This is a question that has been debated in the face of rising crime and general misbehaviour many times.What works with one child does not work with another,due to many different factors.Any child has to be trained in the many differing ways and facets of life and human interaction.Parents lead by example and the child learns certain things from this,but,some children need working parameters ,lines or rules to work to,they will keep expanding the envelope and pushing to see how far they can go.You have to draw the line in no uncertain terms or they will be wild and never conform,you can talk and explain things to some kids and they just laugh behind their parents backs.It is only our recently adopted ideas on child care and total lack of deterrant that has caused the modern culture of indiscriminate street brutality,lawlessness and crime.None of the street gang kids are worried by jail now,they say they can do three months in the holliday camp on their heads,the media and video exposure just compounds this attitude of big respect.|`|ZzyEhSB1aa	My little son is extremely obedient.<br>  I don't have to smack him, all I do is explain to him thoroughly what he has done wrong in a real basic but thorough way and sometimes, he feels so bad that he starts crying.<br>  Parenting needs a lot of patience - don't get me wrong, I have wanted to smack him but I find it easier to take a deep breath, walk out the room, call on God for his help then speak to my son in a balanced way|`|K5nwQfnjaa	I will not pretend to know to know the best way to bring up a child but all I know is that I resent my father for smacking me when I was younger.<br>  <br>  <br>  He has not touched me in 10 years but I still remember it vividly to this day.<br>  <br>  I actually have not been able to forgive him for it.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	Most people I know have had premarital sex, that's a sign of the times. However, if you want to prevent a child committing real sins, i.e. watching Lindsey Lohan films, listening to Girls Aloud etc. then nothing quite says 'punishment' like a weekend with Paul Daniels.|`|73Qzi3vVaa	Nope, a better way would be to inform the child your taking them to Mcdonalds and then drive past 45 Mcdonalds.<br>  <br>  He goes crazy, traumatised and hopefully will behave, for older kids, solitary confinement.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	No. Not for me, at least. For some reason, after seeing the example my parents lead, it makes me want to be a better example for my kids.<br>  <br>  So, I'm never going to hit them. My parents usually felt like crap after they did that, and I wouldn't want to feel like that.|`|iH7ZB5Soaa	The best way to discipline a child is to show the desired behaviour on yourself.(Like prayers,dua etc.)|`|v4xIauuYaa	stop givng them cash or treats.|`|RVUYBxhnaa	No. <br>  I don't think a child should ever be hit. It always results in something worse. The child, when doing something naughty, is just being a child. They cant help it. <br>  By smacking them, they will suddenly feel anger and resentment towards that parent, making them play up more.<br>  In the short term it may make them behave for a while, but in the long term is can seriously affect a child's outcome and can seriously harm a child's emotional stability as they grow.|`|MkJLtbZiaa	be firm and fair but don't hit your child! trust me in 12 years time the child will be very resentful to you and his/her religion. when your child is good show love and affection when their good. when your child asks a question about sex give True answers and explain how you think sex should be approached. the child will grow to respect you and love you in the future.|`|oJAu1T8caa	if you dont discipline your child he or she will think they can get away with things. first it'll be small things like breaking stuff then hitting people and then on. i have to say my mom didnt discipline me and i disrespect her alot. And i think its because she never spanked me or grounded me so YES definitely find some way to discipline your child.|`|fl53gS7maa	Don't smack them! My parents have NEVER smacked me or my siblings and all of us have turned out great =]<br>  If you hit your children or are too strict with them, they'll want to rebel. However, if you have fair punishments and deal with them calmly, kids won't feel the need to "get you back".|`|i2GRGLIpaa	My parents never spanked me.<br>  When I do something wrong there is always a consequence. For me she takes away internet priviledges, but for my younger sister she will put her in time out or take away a toy until she earns it back.|`|s9cT6yJIaa	No, smacking is not a good way. Im a child, 10, and my parents smacked me alot i ended up all red.|`|4aveC2aaaa	it was said to us<br>  <br>  to hit a child if he does not pray by the age of 10<br>  <br>  therefore, we have to teach them their mistake. i do not agree with major beating up and abuse, simply teach them their mistake|`|Rcgy1uDYaa	Absolutely not. Children are not animals. They are not stupid and they would understand why they shouldn't do something if you explain to them properly. A lot of the time, parents just set rules for their kids without even explaining why they have to follow them. If parents explained the Islamic rules properly and communicated with their kids instead of treating them like animals then maybe their kids would realise on their own.<br>  <br>  Also, physical abuse can give children long-term psychological effects. Like Michael Jackson was beaten really badly as a child and that's why he grew up to be a man who's trying to catch up on his childhood. Hiter was also severely abused by his dad and he ended up a murderer. Parents don't realise.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Hitting/Smacking is NEVER EVER the way to discipline, no matter what religion you are in. Hitting will result in the child thinking abuse is okay. Do you think abuse is okay? you must since you thought about it.<br>  <br>  That is NEVER EVER EVER the way. Hopefully you will go to jail if you EVER get caught!<br>  <br>  The best thing is to talk in a strong voice. Do not yell-but make sure they know you are the parent and they will do what you will say. Don't ask them to do something-TELL Them to do something. Don't give them the option of running away.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Do you know how many people were smacked and still participate in pre-marital sex?<br>  <br>  Also it's a little bit disturbing if you think that's the worst thing out there the child could grow up to do. It doesn't hurt anybody. What about stealing or murder?<br>  <br>  I think smacking should be a last resort, and mild, if it's going to be done. Depends on the situation.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|xNEhI9XOaa	Smacking is rarely necessary if you are in control of your children.  They grow up knowing what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour, because you have calmly taught them the rules.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the concept of sin and guilt, we need to get away from those negative ideas.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Spanking is o.k. as long it's not done for every little thing. Also, I do not think it should be done in front of ppl.<br>  <br>  Sometimes grounding may work better, or for a small child time-outs may be effective.
P4WJD6Cpaa	They write their names on a pieces of paper. Then they put it in a fish bowl. Then a blindfolded person chooses it. That is how it is decided.|`|AA11672481	You could always make up a new one. I would pick Awesome.<br>  ...as in "I now pronounce you Mr. & Mr. Awesome"<br>  <br>  <br>  Or, we could just keep our names. Its not exactly a big deal.|`|lPPgMKibaa	most arent allowed to get married, haha, sad, isnt it?|`|bde0658d8cf48c30a8b439401bea4981aa	I would think they either choose, or just keep their own name|`|rKXf85ipaa	Personally I would pick the name of the family that didn't disown them.  If that's not the case I would pick the shorter one, I hate writing.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Heck I hate my last name, no one says it right.  I'll probably change my last name even if I end up with a girl instead of a guy.|`|434163435d63b509d4b68df8f8ecfac3aa	Most that I've known hyphenate it (like Smith-Brown).  Some take whichever one sounds best or is easier to spell/pronounce, some don't do either (they keep their own).  It's largely the same as in hetero marriages where the woman does not fully adopt the man's last name.|`|aW5uShwtaa	I'm the submissive, wifely one in the relationship so I would normally take his last name, however I'm going to keep my last name or hyphen it because I'm descended from a famous american patriot, my namesake Nathan Hale.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	They usually put it together.<br>  I know I would, if I marry a girl (more than likely)<br>  So, it'd be Butter-Cheese, or Cheese-Butter.<br>  No, those aren't real.|`|HPf293N6aa	They usually hyphenate it.|`|psUL6906aa	Women actually don't have to take their husband's last name you know..|`|EAHsmeXLaa	whichever they want.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	whichever u prefer|`|AA10906922	What ever works. Many of my female friends don't take their husbands last name. But my gay female friend took her partners and her partners took her last name. I thought it was cool because they both have nice sounding last names. Every time I talk to them I call them Mrs. and use their new last names. They get a kick out of it. I love them.|`|a6wPnHRQaa	Whichever one sounds best!|`|r9s0VyJgaa	They don't necessarily change names at all.  They just go on with the names they already have.<br>  <br>  Some gay or lesbian couples will hyphenate their two names together, so if Joe Smith marries Bill Jones, they'd both call themselves "Smith-Jones" or whatever.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a gay or lesbian couple will create a whole new last name and both take that new name.  <br>  <br>  There's no real rule about this.  <br>  <br>  But then again, when heterosexual couples get married, there's no rule that says that the wife HAS to take the husband's name either.  I know several straight couples where they hyphenated their names together after they got married, and lots of other couples where the woman kept her own name after marriage.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	They take the masculine gays name. lol
TdROahUnaa	Yeah I'm sure a couple of the loonie ones will contact you shortly to answer any questions you have.<br>  <br>  This is a great place for vampire 'facts' lately.<br>  <br>  In basic legend, they are pale, avoid sunlight, have fangs, are very mesmerizing, only come out at night. Usually also very strong and slender and very beautiful.|`|ZkBLNj6Vaa	These days, vampires look like teenagers, and they suck blood from their scabby knees and hangnails.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	There's not too many physical characteristics other than the obvious ones. If you're talking about today's stereotype... Evil is seductive. Due to lack of sunlight (and being, for the most part, dead,) they are quite pale. Fangs are a classic, but actually aren't in most stories. I assume that they have a cold, bleak aura to them. Something 'bout them seems... hungry. <br>  <br>  If you're talking about older versions... Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Other attributes varied greatly from culture to culture; some vampires, such as those found in Transylvanian tales, were gaunt, pale, and had long fingernails, while those from Bulgaria only had one nostril, and Bavarian vampires slept with thumbs crossed and one eye open. Moravian vampires only attacked while naked, and those of Albanian folklore wore high-heeled shoes. As stories of vampires spread throughout the globe to the Americas and elsewhere, so did the varied and sometimes bizarre descriptions of them: Mexican vampires had a bare skull instead of a head. Brazilian vampires had furry feet and vampires from the Rocky Mountains only sucked blood with their noses and from the victim's ears. Common attributes were sometimes described, such as red hair. Some were reported to be able to transform into bats, rats, dogs, wolves, spiders and even moths. From these various legends, works of literature such as Bram Stoker's Dracula, and the influences of historical bloodthirsty figures such as Gilles de Rais, Elizabeth Báthory, and Vlad ?epe?, the vampire developed into the modern stereotype.<br>  <br>  Everything else depends on genetics, no?<br>  <br>  Many elaborate rituals were used to identify a vampire. Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face.|`|vMP2whcBaa	To what everybody else said you can add the fact that they have no reflection in a mirror because they have no soul and you might want to visit The Vampire's portal, you'll probably find whatever info that you need.|`|aZGRzxxaaa	They drink the blood of humans, are pale, prefer the night, are cold, and can only be killed by total incineration or a stake through the heart.<br>  Please ignore anyone who even mentions Twilight, as they are generally delusional.|`|sKwQiAK6aa	You wouldn't be able to recognize a vampire by any thing other than them telling you.  I can help you with any information that you want to know about them.
DArAz67Caa	neither-----I'm already married to a wonderful Evangelic man who loves me to pieces----and adultery is sinful----|`|5urfAbazaa	an atheist, and my boyfriend is an atheist so it's all good|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I prefer an atheist. If they were a theist they should be a more secular Christian or a deist. I would never EVER date a fundamentalist.|`|HIskrREJaa	i'm atheist...<br>  I've gone out with catholics, a buddhist, a mormon, an atheist, a satanist (he turned out pretty weird), and married a christian... so i don't think religion really matters to me as long as they're good people and respect my own beliefs.|`|4HUZJdVNaa	I would prefer an atheist but a theist would be alright with me if he went<br>  along with my wishes|`|QC94lBXOaa	I've dated both. And I'd much rather go out with the atheist...they treat women better.|`|c316178951b8605e913804fde0cb6becaa	If only in general, than I preferred theists before I got married.  Though, that had a lot to do with the fact that there weren't as many out in the open atheists at that time!  LOL  They've gotten a lot more vocal in the last few years.<br>  <br>  But if I was dating now, it would more depend on his attitude then his set of beliefs.  If he was respectful of my right to believed as I wished and didn't feel he needed to prove my faith wrong or demean it, I would be fine with either.<br>  <br>  I do believe strongly that when we're past the just dating age and are actually looking for a spouse, we should stick to those of similar beliefs.  Marriage is hard enough without adding conflicting beliefs to the mix (especially when children arrive).|`|tK5swgX1aa	An agnostic, whichever category you wanna put that in|`|2rJwgk40aa	I dont care.If the guy is nice and makes me laugh,ill date him regardless of where he stands.|`|AEAxZEveaa	I'm a christian who married an atheist.

I want someone who has a mind of their own and religion or not is not in the picture.|`|JoDpDj8Uaa	It is usually easier to figure out that a person is spiritual (He's wearing a crucifix/Star of David/beard and head covering.  He keeps kosher or is vegan due to spiritual beliefs. He mentions heaven or some similar concept in casual conversation...)  I usually only find out a man is truly an atheist (as opposed to someone who just doesn't talk about his spirituality) because he starts to belittle religion and anyone who dare believe in it.  Since I don't consider religion polite dinner conversation, the attack is usually unprovoked.  Therefore, I have a relative bias toward dating theists but only because most "out" atheists I have met were assholes.  (Polite atheists don't get press. :D)|`|zRyI5CMGaa	Most likely an Atheist (and have in the past), as a theist would most likely be fundamental in views and church and I am Catholic. We would probably argue to much LOL. But seriously it wouldn't be based on beliefs or Non beliefs as mutual respect for each others opinions beliefs non beliefs, would be  a major factor in a relationship.|`|sfTPrMFpaa	My preferences would go in general to an atheist as I am one.<br>  <br>  Although my hubby is an agnostic and we get along pretty fine.<br>  <br>  Him believing in a greater something was always respectful of my skepticism and vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Edit : a fundie would also be out of the question for me.|`|DZ9ADg7Xaa	My boyfriend is theist, but he's not religious at all. He's Catholic by family tradition, but he's got more transcendentalist views and is open-minded. I don't mind if a guy is atheist or theist, as long as he isn't too religious and/or close-minded.|`|36c219280f881fd9a869475fe716cf47aa	If I weren't married already, it would be important to me that I date an atheist.  Sure, he/she being a theist would make for great conversations, however, there are things that I believe and would want him/her to understand and believe as well.|`|frpCK0utaa	honestly, i have no idea. i'd be more hesitant to date a man who doesnt believe in a God, but i certainly wouldnt write him off completely. Who knows, maybe he'd treat me better then the theist. whos to say the theist isnt an alcoholic, or woman beater?<br>  <br>  I too, would steer clear of a fundie. those guys are SCARY.|`|rh8szekzaa	I guess I'd prefer an atheist coz I am one. But, I've always wondered what it'd be like to do a conservative, evangelical white man....;) lol|`|MWuSbFaFaa	i'm a Christian, so i just want him to believe what i do:) if would make life soooo easy...hah but it really doesn't matter i just dont want him to try to change my mind you know??|`|H7gZZcwoaa	I don't really care what they worship (or don't for that matter), as long as they aren't crazy, stupid, or overbearing.|`|Qk3b5qMxaa	Neither.|`|EiyhWrwwaa	I don't really care, as long as he worships me.|`|cic4J2hzaa	neither|`|Mt85amuCaa	i wish i am... then go with theist one... oh god expression is awesome...

rIvGVXZ7aa	Good question.  Here are my thoughts...<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not a choice but it isn't an "end all be all either." That's the thing that society doesn't understand right now. Similar to alcoholism people don't "choose" be an alcoholic... People do choose to either live as an alcoholic or seek help try to understand the root of their thoughts/behavior and explore change (if they'd like). Of course, there is a "value judgment" involved. We as a society value a person who is suffering from alcoholism and say "You know what, being a non-alcoholic is preferred to being an alcoholic."<br>  <br>  I think the same hold true for homosexuality. Yes there is a value judgment. Right now is everyone's saying "gay is the way" but that's not the case for many doctors, parents, children, etc. They're saying "You know what, I'm going to go out on a limb and say heterosexuality... a sexual identity that agrees with ones biological sex IS A PREFERRED route... and I'm not going to be bullied by society's current norms that "gay is the way."<br>  <br>  Read "Homosexuality Disease Or Way of Life?" or "Homosexuality a Freedom too Far" and some purely scientific books to get a better understanding.|`|GYJLnvhzaa	because back in the 80's or 90's you got your @ss kicked on a daily basis for being gay, therefore you had better just stay in the d@mn closet.<br>  Now it's safe to be gay due to hate-crime legislation and better law enforcement and more acceptance in society (not that we don't still have a long way to go). My point is, it's ok for us to come out now, it's like when people are in the middle of a hurricane they all hide, and any passerby would think "where the hell are all the people in this place?" well once the storm is over, everyone comes out of hiding. It's not that they suddenly appeared, they just stopped hiding once it was safe. Not the best analogy, but it's the best I could do right now.|`|AA12082232	Cities like Berlin during the 1920s and 1930s were very openly gay until the Nazis came and "cleansed" the area and in doing so the history of gay culture.|`|V4w61q5Uaa	yes they are, scientific studies were done, in a certain part of your brain, the way it grows determines your sexual orientation.|`|xFg6y1qEaa	If you'd check your facts you might not embarrass yourself by asking stupid questions.

However, if people are going to treat you like crap for being who you are, then sometimes it's easier to just live a lie...or it seems easier.<br>  <br>  Gay people have existed since the beginning of time. Have you ever read ancient writings about how the people lived, and what they did? You will find many allusions to homosexuality. This isn't new - it's just more accepted.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	You must be young, or you would know the answer. Prior to the late 1960's, anti-gay prejudice was so strong, and backed up by bigoted laws, that the vast majority of gay people stayed in the closet and never told anyone they were gay.<br>  <br>  Some of the laws were ridiculous. In NYC, it was illegal to serve alcohol to a gay person. Same sex activity was illegal in most places, and police would entrap people. The only place gay people could meet was bars, but the police raided them several times a week, arrested people on trumped up charges, published names in the papers, etc. This went on for a long time, until 1969, when our people fought back for the first time. Now, for the most part, it is safe to come out, and so people do.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	I think a lot of people think it is "cool" to be bisexual or gay.

Oscar Wilde, and look up/research what century he lived in.<br>  <br>  Are you kidding about not hearing about gay people in the 80's/90's? Didn't you know that before AIDS got its name, its first incarnation (early 80's) was GRIDS (Gay Related Immunodeficiency Syndrome)? When the illness known as AIDS now first showed its hand (in the USA anyway), it seemed to be affecting gay men in large numbers, which is why it was first called GRIDS. Gay people, especially men, were villified, and the homophobes and religious right seized this "opportunity" to step up their "fight" against homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Here's my question: Are people really born straight?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes, and I as a gay person told you "You're in denial, you're born gay, everyone is born gay", how would you react?<br>  <br>  Wouldn't you say "What would a gay person know about being straight? I've been straight all my life!

Our DNA, and our life experiences. People back in the day didn't come out of the closet because they were more likely to be imprisoned, be-headed, ridiculed, and not accepted for being gay. Science is finding that humans are not gay by choice, but by DNA and that is the reason it is more accepted now. I was just learning about gays in my psychology class too and most people who are gay show signs at a young age.

mVTGl6HGaa	The Hopewell tradition (also incorrectly called the "Hopewell culture") is the term used to describe common aspects of the Native American culture that flourished along rivers in the northeastern and midwestern United States from 200 BC to 500 AD. The Hopewell tradition was not a single culture or society, but a widely dispersed set of related populations, which were connected by a common network of trade routes,[1] known as the Hopewell Exchange System. At its greatest extent, the Hopewell exchange system ran from the Southeastern United States into the southeastern Canadian shores of Lake Ontario. Within this area societies participated in a high degree of exchange with the highest amount of activity along waterways. The Hopewell exchange system received materials from all over the United States. Most of the items traded were exotic materials and were received by people living in the major trading and manufacturing areas. These people then converted the materials into products and exported them through local and regional exchange networks. The objects created by the Hopewell exchange system spread far and wide and have been seen in many burials outside the Midwest<br>  <br>  Although the origins of the Hopewell are still under discussion, the Hopewell culture can also be considered a cultural climax.<br>  <br>      Hopewell populations originated in western New York and moved south into Ohio where they built upon the local Adena mortuary tradition. Or Hopewell was said to have originated in western Illinois and spread by diffusion ... to southern Ohio. Similarly, the Havana Hopewell tradition was thought to have spread up the Illinois River and into southwestern Michigan, spawning Goodall Hopewell. (Dancey 114)<br>  <br>  [edit] Politics and hierarchy<br>  <br>  The Hopewell inherited from their Adena forbearers an incipient social stratification, a social system for promoting inter-group relationships and adjusting to food shortages. This increased social stability and reinforced sedentism, social stratification, specialized use of resources and probably, population growth.[3] Hopewell societies cremated most of their deceased and reserved burial for only the most important people. In some sites it appears that hunters received a higher status in the community because their graves were more elaborate and contained more status goods.[4]<br>  <br>  The Hopewell culture had leaders, but they were not like powerful rulers who could command armies of slaves and soldiers.[5] It is likely these cultures accorded certain families a special place of privilege. Some scholars suggest that these societies were marked by the emergence of “big-men”.[6] These leaders acquired their position because of their ability to persuade others to agree with them on important matters such as trade and religion. They also perhaps were able to develop influence by the creation of reciprocal obligations with other important members of the community. Whatever the source of their status and power, the emergence of “big-men” was another step toward the development of the highly structured and stratified sociopolitical organization called the chiefdom.[7]<br>  <br>  [edit] Mounds<br>  Hopewell mounds from the Mound City Group in Ohio<br>  <br>  Today, the best-surviving features of the Hopewell culture era are mounds built for uncertain purposes. Great geometric earthworks are one of the most impressive Native American monuments throughout American prehistory. Eastern Woodlands mounds have various geometric shapes and rise to impressive heights. The function of the mounds is still under debate. Due to considerable evidence and surveys, plus the good survival condition of the largest mounds, more information can be obtained.<br>  <br>  Several scientists, including Dr. Bradley T. Lepper, Curator of Archaeology, Ohio Historical Society, hypothesize that the Octagon earthwork at Newark, Ohio, was a lunar observatory oriented to the 18.6 year cycle of minimum and maximum lunar risings and settings on the local horizon. Dr. John Eddy completed an unpublished survey in 1978, and proposed a lunar major alignment for the Octagon. Ray Hively and Robert Horn of Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana were the first researchers to analyze numerous lunar sightlines at the Newark Octagon (1982) and the High Bank earthworks (1984) in Chillicothe, Ohio.[8] Christopher Turner noted that the Fairground Circle in Newark, Ohio aligns to the sunrise on May 4, i.e. that it marked the May cross quarter sunrise.[9] In 1983, Christopher Turner demonstrated that the Hopeton Earthworks encode various sunrise and moonrise patterns, including the winter and summer solstices, the equinoxes, the cross quarter dates, the lunar maximum events, and the lunar minimum events.[10]<br>  <br>  William F. Romain has written a book on the subject of "astronomers, geometers, and magicians" at the earthworks.[11]<br>  <br>  [edit] Artwork<br>  Hand carved in mica by the Hopewell<br>  <br>  The Hopewell created some of the finest craftwork and artwork of the Americas.

For example, the Pope's body is mummified after death almost exactly the same way that the egyptians did it in the time of the pharoahs, and nearly all of the "biblical" stories can be traced to ancient texts from religions that the christians pretend to denounce. Let's remember, of course that your guidebook (the bible) was written by men, whose only proof that they were inspired by a god is that it is written in the book they wrote.

If the athiests are right, when the christian and the athiest die, they will both be dead, there will be no difference if you or he believed, but if the christian is right, he will gain everything and the athiest will lose the great reward.

I cant get a car cause i have no money, hmmmm i wonder why i have no money. Oh yea,  i have no job because i live in this town, where EVERYTHING is going out of business. My father cant get food stamps or medica for some strange reason, oh yea he got laid off from his job. <br>  A dead mother who never GOT to feel the holy spirit, who i had prayed for like crazy, hoping someday she'd believe in God. But she died when i was 14 and if there is a Hell, she'd be there. And a whole lotta crap you dont wanna hear about. And you know whats wierd???<br>  <br>  IM NOT THE ONLY PERSON WHO GOES THROUGHT THIS. 10000000 other people have it a million times worse then i do. I consider myself lucky, and now that i no longer live for a "God" I am happy. <br>  This God doesnt exist, it isnt possilble.

I tend to handle the public carefully.<br>  <br>  I, too, dislike being called endearments and it is condescending.  Oddly, sometimes when people are doing it (and it's obvious they have adopted the habit as a way of propping up their self esteem through habitual condescension, although they may not even consciously realize it) I will say "My name is ___ (either my first name or Ms. Smith)___/ or "please don't call me ___.  I only like to hear endearments from my loved ones.  I'm sure you understand."  Sometimes I return endearments (I've even used "sugar britches" on a rather bold man, and hilarity ensued, but even I admit that was a bit of a risk).  But most often I just ignore them but will usually avoid that business in the future.|`|T9kMy13Haa	Obviously this person isn't a bully they were helping you.|`|XZwkLeZ9aa	I don't know why she was a "bully."

If she wasn't intent on embarrassing me, I'd ignore it, and try to teach her the right way to interact w/ people.

nQvcqVkNaa	One must study God's Word the Bible in order to learn the truth. The Roman government, which took over "christianity" in the 4th century, like many pagan nations before them believed in a trinity god. This type of god does not exist in the Bible. Yhshua/Jesus should be one of the greatest authorities on this since he was the one created by YHWH/Jehovah and sent to earth by Him and raised from the dead by Him and given all authority by Him. Jesus *never* claimed to be equal to Jehovah. In fact Jesus calls Jehovah his God and says Jehovah is the only true God. Please read the Scriptures and cease being mislead by those who support Roman paganism.<br>  <br>  Yhshua/Jesus made it quite clear in his own words and the things he taught his Apostles that he is *not* equal to his God YHWH/Jehovah. (Acts 3:13)<br>  <br>  Yhshua/Jesus always submits to YHWH/Jehovah's will and never considered himself equal to his God (Philippians 2:5-11 & 1 Corinthians 15:24-28)<br>  <br>  Jesus is our role model. Everything he did, we are supposed to do (1 Peter 2:21; John 13:15-17) He preached about his Father Jehovah, he made known the name of his Father Jehovah, he prayed to his Father Jehovah, he served his Father Jehovah (John 12:28 & John 17:26 & Matthew 26:39-42 & Matthew 20:23 & Luke 22:29 & John 8:54 & Acts 3:13) A true Christian does as Jesus did. You can not serve Christ's Father the way Christ did if you do not know (or refuse to use) His name Jehovah. Are you worshipping the God that Jesus worships? You certainly wouldn't want to be denying Jesus words (John 20:17 & Revelation 3:12 & Mark 15:34) or the truth that he taught to his apostles (Acts 3:13 & 1 Corinthians 15:24-28) Anyone who claims that Jesus is equal to Jehovah is opposing Jesus own words and is thereby blinded as mentioned at 2 Corinthians 11:3, 4. Jesus own words condemn any notion that he is equal to Jehovah (Philippians 2:5-7)<br>  Satan has successfully had Jehovah's name removed from most Bibles now. Satan has also convinced many that it is right to murder for their country and that it is ok to carry on celebrations rooted in pagan worship to false gods. Most people who call themselves christian today are false christians (Matthew 7:21-23) They are on the broad road to destruction (Matthew 7:13) but only those few that are doing the will of Christ's Father (Matthew 7:21) are on the narrow road to life (Matthew 7:14)<br>  <br>  Jesus is speaking in the following Scriptures, if you blindly support the trinity god then it is tantamount to claiming Jesus was lying!<br>  I dont think he was lying when he said the following things:<br>  John 20:17<br>  John 17:3-5<br>  John 5:19<br>  John 14:28<br>  Mark 10:18<br>  Matthew 26:39<br>  John 8:17-18<br>  Mark 13:32<br>  Matthew 20:23<br>  Matthew 3:17<br>  Matthew 14:23<br>  Mark 1:35<br>  Mark 6:46<br>  Mark 14:32<br>  Luke 6:12<br>  Colossians 1:15<br>  John 3:16<br>  Revelation 3:12<br>  1 Corinthians 15:24-28<br>  Acts 3:13<br>  Philippians 2:6<br>  Matthew 26:64<br>  Mark 14:62<br>  Luke 22:69<br>  Acts 2:33-36<br>  Acts 5:30, 31<br>  Acts 7:55, 56<br>  Romans 8:34<br>  Ephesians 1:17-21<br>  Psalm 110:1<br>  Hebrews 10:13<br>  Hebrews 12:2<br>  1 Peter 3:22|`|ArCl9fJsaa	Christians:Is Jesus the son of god,or god himself?

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

tjiiaqjIaa	Islam is a religion but however is a made up one.  The prophet Muhammad took many exerts from the Bible and Christianity by listening to Christians and Jews he encountered in his lifetime.  In Muhammad's time, these people in Saudi Arabia had over 360 Gods and Muhammad wanted them to worship only 1 God.  He picked one God from out of the 360 with the name Allah which is a pagan God.  Most muslims don't know the history of Allah and will tell you their God is the same God as the Jewish and Christian God but it is NOT.  They deny the trinity and Jesus as the savior.  One must be careful of falso teachings.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Do you consider Catholicism a religion, making priests denounce the natural, and then protect them when they touch little boys because of it?<br>  <br>  Do you consider Christianity a religion, spreading the message love thy neighbor, and then telling them simultaneously to hate gays?<br>  <br>  Islam worships women, not desecrate them.  They are not allowed to show their hair because in that religion the hair is sacred, and if a woman shows her hair, it can lead to another man coveting her.  They are not required to cover their face.  The women are allowed to go to school, just because the fundamentalist muslim's who are ultimately your terrorists, practice that way does not classify the entire religion.  Get some facts next time you arrogant ***.|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	Muslim women observe HIJAB (covering the head and the body) because Allah has told them to do so.<br>  <br>  "O Prophet, tell your wives and daughters and the believing women to draw their outer garments around them (when they go out or are among men). That is better in order that they may be known (to be Muslims) and not annoyed..." [Noble Quran 33:59]<br>  <br>  Other secondary reasons include the requirement for modesty in both men and women. Both will then be evaluated for intelligence and skills instead of looks and sexuality. An Iranian school girl is quoted as saying, "We want to stop men from treating us like sex objects, as they have always done. We want them to ignore our appearance and to be attentive to our personalities and mind. We want them to take us seriously and treat us as equals and not just chase us around for our bodies and physical looks." A Muslim woman who covers her head is making a statement about her identity. Anyone who sees her will know that she is a Muslim and has a good moral character. Many Muslim women who cover are filled with dignity and self esteem; they are pleased to be identified as a Muslim woman. As a chaste, modest, pure woman, she does not want her sexuality to enter into interactions with men in the smallest degree. A woman who covers herself is concealing her sexuality but allowing her femininity to be brought out.<br>  <br>  . The wives of the Prophet (peace be upon him) were required to cover their faces so that men would not think of them in sexual terms since they were the "Mothers of the Believers," but this requirement was not extended to other women.<br>  <br>   The Quran says:<br>  <br>  "Say to the believing man that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that will make for greater purity for them; and Allah is well acquainted with all that they do. And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; and that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what must ordinarily appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands..." [Noble Quran 24:30-31]<br>  <br>  These verses from the Quran contain two main injunctions:<br>  <br>  A woman should not show her beauty or adornments except what appears by uncontrolled factors such as the wind blowing her clothes, and<br>  <br>  the head covers should be drawn so as to cover the hair, the neck and the bosom.<br>  <br>  Often forgotten is the fact that modern Western dress is a new invention. Looking at the clothing of women as recently as seventy years ago, we see clothing similar to Hijab. These active and hard-working women of the West were not inhibited by their clothing which consisted of long, full dresses and various types of head covering. Muslim women who wear Hijab do not find it impractical or interfering with their activities in all levels and walks of life. Hijab is not merely a covering dress but more importantly, it is behavior, manners, speech and appearance in public.<br>  <br>  Get the fact right. Without knowing the actual fact you simply wrote " making your wife cover her face".....When actually Allah asked women to cover her face and not husband instructed them to do so and 2ndly, covering face is optional based on what i have said.<br>  <br>  A Woman in Islam Has the Right to Get an Education <br>  In the words of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW): <br>  <br>  "To seek knowledge is obligatory on every Muslim."<br>  (Declared Authentic By Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani) <br>  <br>  Muslim here meaning male and female Muslims, as women are the twin halves of men. The Prophet (SAW) also said: <br>  <br>  "Whoever follows a way to seek knowledge, Allah will make easy for him a way to paradise." (Declared Authentic By Shaikh Muhammad Naasir-ud-Deen Al-Albaani) <br>  <br>  A woman in Islam has the right to knowledge and education. Allah (SWT) encourages women to read and keep up the learning process. He also bestows His mercy upon all who seek knowledge, and gives them high status: <br>  <br>  "O you who believe! When you are told to make room in the assemblies, (spread out and) make room. Allah will give you (ample) room (from His Mercy). And when you are told to rise up (for prayers, Jihad, or for any other good deed), rise up. Allah will exalt in degree those of you who believe, and those who have been granted knowledge. And Allah is Well-Acquainted with what you do. (Al-Mujadilah 58:11) <br>  <br>  This is referring to religious knowledge, in the first place, and to any other kind of knowledge, in the second place, where one has the intention of benefiting herself, her family and the Islamic society. Additionally, a husband should not forbid his wife from going out of the house to seek basic religious knowledge, unless he is teaching her at home.<br>  <br>  Well, it is clear yo you now that muslims women have the rights to seek for knowledge. I am a muslims woman and i am given the same opportunities to compete and study with men. If you are referring to certain group of muslims who forbidden their daughters to seek for knowledge then, it is their own practice, NOT the islamic practice.|`|iHLt9Juyaa	Islam is a religion.

(Remember your Shakespeare, "Beware the Ides of March.") <br>  <br>  From these points, dates were then reckoned backwards. So your birthdate would be reckoned back from the Calends of January. To make matters even stranger, the day before the Calends is considered the day  before the Calends, but the day before that is considered three days before the Calends. Oy! Or, as they say in Latin, heu!<br>  <br>  So, your birthday, in Roman nomenclature, is sixteen days before the Calends of January. There are four different ways to express this in Latin.

czdCtTvWaa	It is not that big of a sin, but you either have to convert him/her to islam in order to marry them... If you don't convert them you can't marry them, and if they really  love you they will convert.|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Ultimately no it is not.  They prefer you to stay within the religion, especially the women.  For the women, they are the key to the bloodline, and they prefer that they give birth to Muslim children, but they are allowed, as long as they convert out, and as far as the men, they are allowed to marry out, and the woman doesn't have to convert if she doesn't truly believe in it.  Also, they are allowed to have multiple spouses, but only because they believe its disrespectful to leave their wife or husband, and if that spouse is unable to produce children, then they okay it with their current spouse, and take on another spouse for child bearing purposes.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	yes its a sin because the churches stand to lose allot of money from selling faith to those that's not in a mixed belief plus the currency is different it makes it that much harder for the Pasteur to get rich quick on others salvation. How big is it you ask well that depends on how much money you hold out on pass the 10% Hope this answer your question.|`|MTi7r9l6aa	Under Sharia law, it's punishable by torture. I wouldn't advise it if you're in the Middle East. Otherwise, go for the gusto. I don't think Allah would condemn you for loving someone who found a different path to him.|`|nOT6vxIwaa	farting is a sin in islam.......get out of it and save your sanity|`|fke15sxMaa	Probably not.

Muslim women are allowed to only marry Muslim men, since Islam is a patrimonial religion (passed down by one's father).

5e9a90f48dace9068df57b91e1f8ec13aa	I'm not sure if there is a God. There is no proof for the existance of God. That would make Him scientific, and of course that would contradict His nature. Science is of the natural world. It can study nature because nature is consistant and predictable. Nature has laws. God created those laws, so he must not be bound by them. The creation of the universe was breaking the law of logic, so He must be above that also. So then, it would be impossible to prove the existance of something beyond logic by using the tools of logic. God then is beyond our knowledge and it is completely impossible to know whether or not there is a God. If you could prove the existance of God, then He would not be beyond our universe, and therefore He would be nothing more than part of nature like you me and a tree.<br>  <br>  So, I'm stuck. That makes me sad.|`|WWIs1o5qaa	There is as much proof for God as there is a random big bang or evolution or whatever. Like I just posted on another question. Atheists always ask me "So where does God come from? Everything has a beginning right?". I answer with a question to those who believe in a big bang: "So you say everything has a beginning right? So where did that little piece of matter come from that jump-started the big bang come from? It had to come from somewhere right? And when you get an answer then where did the answer to that come from?"|`|7Ohs5ABCaa	The concept of a god does not make sense to me.  Why does something intelligent have to create the universe?  Never got that point and never will.|`|19JkC34Xaa	No evidence. Believers can be extremely intolerant. Its all just BS.|`|VvyJ1yRUaa	in my opinion, they do believe in God and are somewhat afraid of Hell but I think that they don't want to take reasponibility or be held accountable for their actions i also think they're scared for their social status<br>  <br>  <br>  of course they'll say i'm wrong, I'll get lots of thumbs downs and they won't own up to it but i still think i am correct|`|QpF6Tjtiaa	Because the concept of god sounds more like a childrens story than an explanation for why we are here. <br>  <br>  There is no way I could ever entertain the notion of an all-loving supernatural being watching over us. It is completely absurd, there is an infinite number of better explanations for what I am observng here in the real world.|`|QvlL83AJaa	It's not 'belief,' it is fact.|`|CMLArWFraa	Religion is like a security blanket, and athiests are the kids that never needed it. i'm not saying people who believe are weak. i'm just saying its a comfort some perfer to have, and some dont. to me, it doesnt matter if there is or isnt someone to worship. i try to live a good life for those i love, and myself, not for someone written in tales. (no offense) i figure if there is perchance a God, that how i live is good enough. lifes too much without worrying about what cant be answered, so i stick with what can and i am content with that :) but believing doesnt hurt, as long as you dont take it too far ^^|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	What reason do I have to believe in god?

It's so obvious that he is man-made...<br>  The first god (maybe sun) was created by people isn't this correct? So how do you know that this god is false and yours is true?|`|ZMTGeg51aa	It doesn't offend me, I don't believe in god because I feel like there is a lack of evidence he is real. But maybe im wrong, Maybe there is a god, i guess i will find out when i die|`|p7qUlvEnaa	Because there is not evidence to support it. Why's that hard to understand? Do you believe in Santa? the easter bunny?? Fairies?|`|uGEwKRilaa	I don't see the logic in a god.<br>  I don't see any proof.<br>  Therefore, I do not believe.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Because there is no logical reason to. No proof and the universe can exist without a God.<br>  <br>  I don't see how Christianity, a fairly new religion, is any more true than any of the old religions that are now mythology.<br>  <br>  I think its important to ask questions and ponder things than have 'God' be the end all answers to all life's questions.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	I am atheist because no hypothetical god any believer has proposed has made sense to me.  Perhaps, someday I will find a well formed god hypothesis, that not only is not self contradictory, but is supported by evidence.  Then I might become a theist.<br>  <br>  So, what I am saying is that I don't have any conceptual problem with any actual, existing deity if I happen to meet one, someday.  I have problems with god hypotheses that humans invent and then pretend that these imagined deities are something real.<br>  <br>  -- <br>  Regards,<br>  <br>  John Popelish|`|AA11974194	For the same reason you don't believe in Zeus.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	I just don't buy it.<br>  <br>  Is that plain enough?|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJR really and truly tried to believe.  For the first 37 years of his life, the final 27 with IJR's consent, IJR did everything in his power to believe.  At one point, IJR was certain IJR would be entering a seminary and become a CATHOLIC PRIEST.  Thank God that never happened, as IJR would have made a lousy Priest.  BUt, as he grew older, IJR took a cold, hard look at religion, the Universe, Life, Science and all that, and questioned his beliefs.  IJR came to the only logical conclusion he could:  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WAY A DEITY COULD POSSIBLY EXIST IN THE UNIVERSE.   After making that statement, IJR had what can only be called a Religious experience, but in reverse.  THe whole world opened up to IJR, and IJR has never been happier in his life, free from the hypocrisy and falsehoods of religosity.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	I see no evidence to come to the conclusion that a god or gods exist.<br>  <br>  I also very much dislike the god of the Bible, who is ruthless, homophobic, murderous, and vile.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	In the past few centuries, we've come to understand how the world around us came to be, without any supernatural intervention.  The story from the Big Bang to us is fairly clear and plausible, with considerable scientific evidence for much of the story.  We certainly don't understand everything, and we don't understand what happened before the Big Bang or what caused it, but an awful lot has been explained without recourse to the supernatural.<br>  <br>  One thing that has only recently been understood is how complex things arise spontaneously from simpler origins.  It does seem that everything in the natural world arose this way.<br>  <br>  The "first cause", if there was one, is so remote and so impersonal that it almost certainly is not the personal god of the bible, who knows and cares about individual human beings.  There is no evidence that the first cause is complex, or intelligent like a god.|`|LGBNKuxRaa	do you want a top ten list or something? because it's a long list. see:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/GodProof.htm" rel="nofollow">http://godlessgeeks.com/LINKS/GodProof.h...</a><br>  <br>  one thousand lame arguments add up to nothing but a whole lot of lame.|`|dFrMhJxUaa	The simply truth is that, all religions are copied from Nature, mankind made up God, Gods, Goddess. To try and describe the world around them, so in my point of view, all religions had a beginning and it was mankind's imagine of which they emulated  from Nature.  <br>  <br>  Each answer is their own point of view, just like all the Christians denominations have their own point of view that they are the true believers.

Is that straight enough for you?|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	I'm not sure why they wouldn't give you a straight answer. It couldn't be more simple.

Simple as. There is NOTHING to suggest that there is any such thing as a God of any kind and there has never been.<br>  <br>  I've never felt an sort of "divine" or "celestial" intervention in my life and I've never in any way felt touched by God or anything. I also consider the Bible to be completely fabricated. No one knows when exactly it was written, who wrote it and whether the people who wrote it actually believed what they were saying to be true or if they were just saying it for their own ends. The Bible doesn't prove anything.<br>  <br>  I also think that religion stunts our curiosity about the world by saying "God did it" to every question we can't answer. I think science is much closer to providing us with some real answers to give us a better and more realistic picture of the world we live in.<br>  <br>  I've never bought into the idea that some divine being created the world and everything in it. Aside from the obvious lack of proof, it's clearly absurd.|`|kZW8xXoKaa	"I've asked a few people that say they are Atheists, but they didn't really give me a straight answer."<br>  <br>  Hmm...a Straight answer. I don't know what they told you but if they said 'there isn't proof', that's about as straight as it gets! If you don't understand that, that's something you need to evaluate.<br>  <br>  But I'll give you a little example:<br>  <br>   If I were to say I believe in Santa Claus (he watches us all, all throughout the year to evaluate our actions. he really flies around the world in a sleigh and delivers gifts on Dec 24) <br>  <br>  Now if you use your logic and rationale you will think I've got this all wrong, that it isn't true! And since you've never seen this guy I call Santa and have no other reason to believe in him besides taking my word for it then you are now in the position to ask for proof (the burden of proof would lie on me b/c I made the claim about a being that can not be physically seen or tested).<br>  <br>  Now if I cant provide unequivocal, undeniable proof then you Should by all logical means not believe a word that I say about Mr. Claus.|`|ki3XY49daa	Honestly, I was raised in a Baptist family.  They were all very active in the church.  As I got older and started reading the bible and paying attention to the things around me,  I started asking questions that I couldn't get answers to.  When I did find answers, they contradicted everything I thought I had known about Christianity.  So, eventually, I came to the conclusion that I did not believe in the Christian version of a god.  It made no sense to me.  Though, having said that..I am not now nor have I ever been one of those atheists that will tell a Christian their belief system is stupid.  While I may not agree with it, I will not disrespect it.|`|Gn6jwmzCaa	Ummmm...because god is just like : Aliens/UFO's...Fairies...Goblins...Santa Claus...Unicorns...Witches...Talking snakes...Thor...Zeus...etc etc...<br>  <br>  There is no evidence for any of these things including god...unless you think a book and human flapping lips flapping that the book is the word of god is evidence that an intelligent person should accept.|`|VNrchvUNaa	There is no credible, tangible, verifiable, irrefutable, concrete evidence to support the existence that there is a deity.<br>  <br>  That "straight" enough an answer?|`|qRue8Xdraa	A straight answer is "I'm an atheist", actually.<br>  <br>  The question you're asking now is what you should have asked.<br>  <br>  And, to save the time, there's too much reasons.|`|6Qrqoslpaa	Same reason I don't believe in the tooth fairy or Santa Claus.

HEtmduLfaa	Start strength training. It will give you more confidence in fighting this kid. Let me tell you something though, You shouldn't take any bull from this kid otherwise it will haunt you when you get older. Alot of kids messed with me in school and now i'm in my 20's and still think about settling the score. Don't let this happen to you.|`|6PBGAp7Raa	start lifting|`|0boTBFEVaa	You need to seek help from someone trustworthy that won't hurt you any more than you already are. It's a very serious issue and you have to get to the root of the problem in order to fix it. Counseling is very helpful and you should always remember that you deserve to be happy and healthy! Life is too short to allow these things to continue! Find a way to get away from the person abusing you. And don't let them win by abusing yourself. Good luck!

I have been told that sometimes my brain could be processing what it wants to say faster than the fingers have a chance to type the words, sort of like stuttering. It isn't a bad thing in other words.If you slow down your thoughts it may help to keep your typing at the same speed as your thinking.  Not sure if that will help you, but it is a theory.|`|8XSfMPDwaa	Yeah! That happens sometimes when I am reading out loud, I'll mix up the order of the words or I'll skip to the next line in the middle of the sentence! Crazy.

Xsen794Aaa	The word "chigau" is a ver meaning "to differ; to be different" and is the most common word used for this purpose.

But if you don't feel right about it, donate it to a church, or those boxes you see at stores, McDonalds, 7-11.|`|1vgseyCqaa	You simply need to advertise in some fashion that you found the dollar and where and when you found it, and then when the owner comes to claim it ask him or her who they voted for.

UhyvM73iaa	You can achieve Noor on your face by developing Taqwa (consciousness of presence of Allah all the times and that our actions are being recorded by Angels in our record). <br>  <br>  Taqwa can be developed by following<br>  <br>  1. five pillars of Islam. Every Muslim knows what five pillars of Islam are<br>  2. By reading about life of Prophet Mohammad SAW and his ahadith.<br>  3. By having good knowledgfe of Islam, strong belief in Allah<br>      and His  Messenger and following all teachings of Islam<br>      right and wrong.<br>  4.  By reading Quran daily on regular basis<br>  5.  Paying yearly zakat (ppor tax)<br>  6.  Giving charity to needy and supporting Masjid projects.<br>  7.  Never hurt any human's feeling.<br>  8.  Loves Allah and His Messenger more than any one else.<br>  <br>  Those Muslims who do regularly all the above,  Allah blesses their faces with His Noor.

I can see the innocence on her face and this light or noor that always enlightens her. Same thing for my sister. Also people who are very pious and fulfill Allah swt every command Allah swt illuminates them with his noor mashallah, Also it is said a hadees if i can properly recall .. if you do wodhu ie the ablution 100% properly u r in a state of complete purity or PAKEEZA as we call it and that is when Allah swt gives you noor when u purify to pray to him|`|0NXdjyo2aa	Read surah kahf on Fridays ( sorry haven't got the time to provide you with Hadith references, it would be nice if someone could ).|`|a8c3721d218891d4a3fb70f51dc29b23aa	salam<br>  <br>  noor comes on your face if you pray 5 times daily 24/7 and at least read one ruku from the quran after praying..and do good deeds, don't lie..|`|YU5ke1fOaa	Don't go to the beach LOL <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  well, you have to be a good person.|`|3E2EQH12aa	argh i cant think of it right now.. but im pretty sure 1 is by reading surah kahf on thursday night, and your face shines with noor until the following week's jumah. i think that was one..
jBvKBrMEaa	I think that "lewd" or not isn't your judgment to make. I doubt that glances through a window that is not yours or snippets of conversation eavesdropped give you the context to rightly draw any sort of sensational conclusions. <br>  <br>  Now if you hear someone clearly call out, or see some clear act of violence, then by all means act upon that data. Until that point if you see what appear to be content people and their words or actions appear incomprehensible to you, please resist the urge to assume the most perverse possible interpretation. <br>  <br>  In short, keep your nose out your neighbor's window.  o.O|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	Perhaps he's trying to let his daughter know she shouldn't wear low cut things.   Where on the thigh was he touching her?  On the top or outside, it's odd but I don't see a problem.  On the inside, there's a problem.  Again, if the mother isn't bothered, then I guess you shouldn't be.  I have a friend whose 17 year old daughter still sits on his lap sometimes.  Also, how have you been privy to all this stuff?|`|aZWxKhbhaa	That is lewd.  The father should be more mindful to what he looks and touches and it is the mother's job to take care of her daughters clothing issues.

Many of us are "sensitive" and can feel their presence.  Sometimes they speak to us in dreams or when one is in deep meditation.  The poetry is another matter, it is not from beyond the grave, and I think it would be quite appropriate to share them with those they were meant for.

BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|Bg7tvAjpaa	I have had two paranormal experiences...<br>  <br>  (1) Happened when I was seven. I was talking to a little girl who was sitting in the corner, while my parents were out and the babysitter was in the living room. She'd been told to sit there because she was being naughty and the other children were playing with their dolls while she had to watch - the ultimate punishment back then, I guess. When I told Mum and Dad about the little girl, they just looked at each other funny and booked me in to see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. <br>  <br>  Reason: Our house was built in 1644. <br>  <br>  (2) When I was twelve, I was walking across the school gym when there was no one else in it, and I saw a flash of white on my left. When I looked out of the corner of my eye I saw what I thought was a luminous white cat, licking it's paws, but I what I later realized was a ghost cat as it disappeared into thin air. I don't need to tell you I got the hell out of there as fast as I could run. <br>  <br>  Reason: Our school was one of the first built in the area... about 1890.<br>  <br>  The reason your Ouija board didn't work is because you probably don't have any spirits in your house. Or they were taking the day off.|`|yl1HldKhaa	My house has alot of strange things that go on with ghosts. I did not believe before but my friends and I, or whoever go into my house say they see the same old lady with black hair and a dress. About 2 weeks ago my T.V turned on at like 2 or 3 and killing me softly came on. I was freaked out! I also grew up in this house when I was a little girl about 7 i saw her over my bed and called my mom and they told me a lady died in my house. I still live in the house by myself ( mom died and dad lives in NJ) and I getted creeped out... If she doesnt pay the rent, I want her out =] lol|`|EWR01atlaa	NEVER try it in your home. Are you nuts. You could release spirits in your house, and they aren't going to be very happy. And if your house wasn't haunted then you wouldn't have found anything anyways. My suggestion if you want something ''Special'' to happen.. then go to a cemetary.. Which isn't a very good thing either. That's actually kinda dangerous. I did that once and the Ouija board worked BUT it wasn't a very nice experience. My advice Just stay away from Ouija boards.|`|XktkAZVfaa	I've seen a ghost before, and I have seen bright flashes of light before. Very strange stuff. I even have taken a picture of an orb on accident, <a href="http://ffrrooggzz.deviantart.com/art/orb-113607152." rel="nofollow">http://ffrrooggzz.deviantart.com/art/orb...</a> When I saw a ghost, I was sleeping in my boyfriends living room at his house, and I woke up from his dog's barking and I looked over into the kitchen and a tall guy, wearing all white, was standing next to the kitchen, and started to walk into the kitchen. I thought it was my boyfriend, and I got up, walked into the kitchen following him (it was completely dark in there) and he wasn't there. I was very scared by this. Anyways, you can email me if you want to talk about this stuff... its on my profile.<br>  <br>  *edit* my picture link messed up:<br>  <a href="http://ffrrooggzz.deviantart.com/art/orb-113607152" rel="nofollow">http://ffrrooggzz.deviantart.com/art/orb...</a>|`|AA10824838	booooo this is your first experience with a ghost<br>  <br>  were ya scared?

AA11115051	The message of the Holy Bible is Love. We argue because we're humans, I think at some point all of us have fueled that fired with out hurtful comments or wrong opinions (myself included) But I'm learning to respect my Christian brothers and pray for those who do not have salvation, because only if they knew the True GOD and paradise they would see His beauty Holiness and Perfection. May the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. GOD Bless you all|`|eDCX6Xmeaa	I'm not religious at all in it sounds good but if it's true what they say about why we have so many religions is that each religion is serving a different god and that is why conversations between defferent religions turn out to be arguments because A God directly affects a persons emotions.|`|XuO2rTteaa	It's not about who is best, it's about who is right.

God's Elect recognises this and calls attention to it. On this website all religions and non-religions  are open-season, even yours dear.<br>  <br>  I do not care to actively  participate in these arguments, for it is a fuel to ridicule,  from the scoffers of God and His people. Unity is needed, but many are also in denial. Sadly, there are many haters and Bible thumpers here that are fanatical in their accusations.<br>  <br>   Instead of arguing, I choose a different approach:  I inform and  choose to pray for the deliverance from false doctrine, false prophets, cults, and the resentment that stems from it that affect the Righteous in Christ.  All of us are learning, including the non-believers who claim that they are here just for entertainment purposes. I don't know half of the answers that are answered on this website, but I try my best and study the Word daily to know what I am talking about dear. When I answer questions, I am very careful not to cause my brothers and sisters to stumble and fall. I'd rather lift them up instead. <br>  Strife in heaven is not allowed. Many of the people we argue with, we shall see in heaven..........<br>  <br>  Many of us are given the Gift of Discernment, and know the Truth, but it is to be the Judgment of God, and we as Christians, are only to warn. Sometimes our answers are " Tough Love ", yet still love. <br>  We love our brothers and sisters in Christ, and don't want to see them to go down the same road that the disobedient go, because of  false teachings and doctrines. We love non-believers and are told to lead them to Christ in our letter from God. The Lord in heaven, is the Final Judgment,  for our names , our good, and our sins are written in the Book of Life. Many times it is difficult to answer here when others are in mind, for we do love..............|`|j5YwuVEIaa	It is not a matter of being the 'best'. It is a matter of worship that is approved by God. If you think about it, there was only one acceptable way to worship when Jesus was on earth right? It is still the same today. Jesus gave many qualities to look for that would identify the true religion, the one teaching the 'accurate knowledge' that the bible speaks about.<br>  This should help you while using your bible consider the following:<br>  <br>  ARE ALL RELIGIONS ACCEPTABLE TO GOD?<br>  Judg. 10:6,?7: “The sons of Israel again proceeded to do what was bad in the eyes of Jehovah, and they began to serve the Baals and the Ashtoreth images and the gods of Syria and the gods of Sidon and the gods of Moab and the gods of the sons of Ammon and the gods of the Philistines. So they left Jehovah and did not serve him. At this Jehovah’s anger blazed against Israel.” (If a person worships any thing or any person other than the true God, the Creator of heaven and earth, it is evident that his form of worship is not acceptable to Jehovah.)<br>  Mark 7:6,?7: “He [Jesus] said to them [the Jewish Pharisees and scribes]: ‘Isaiah aptly prophesied about you hypocrites, as it is written, “This people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far removed from me. It is in vain that they keep worshiping me, because they teach as doctrines commands of men.”’” (Regardless of whom a group profess to worship, if they hold to doctrines of men instead of the inspired Word of God, their worship is in vain.)<br>  Rom. 10:2,?3: “I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God; but not according to accurate knowledge; for, because of not knowing the righteousness of God but seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.” (People may have God’s written Word but lack accurate knowledge of what it contains, because they have not been taught properly. They may feel that they are zealous for God, but they may not be doing what he requires. Their worship is not going to please God, is it?)<br>  Is it true that there is good in all religions?<br>  Most religions do teach that a person should not lie or steal, and so forth. But is that sufficient? Would you be happy to drink a glass of poisoned water because someone assured you that most of what you were getting was water?<br>  2?Cor. 11:14,?15: “Satan himself keeps transforming himself into an angel of light. It is therefore nothing great if his ministers also keep transforming themselves into ministers of righteousness.” (Here we are cautioned that not everything that originates with Satan may appear hideous. One of his chief methods of deceiving mankind has been false religion of all kinds, to some of which he gives a righteous appearance.)<br>  2?Tim. 3:2,?5: “Men will be .?.?. having a form of godly devotion but proving false to its power; and from these turn away.” (Regardless of their outward professions of love for God, if those with whom you worship do not sincerely apply his Word in their own lives, the Bible urges you to break off such association.)|`|BfnVCjh2aa	I personally think that religion was a key to our great survival success. religion gives morals and brought people together, so it changed the game from survival of the fittest to survival of the most together., and since survival conditions are different around the world religions around the world are different to, but it was also to explain nature so religion was a way to coop and live in nature with out being over come by it.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Sorry, but I disagree. Yes God wants us to know what is good, but he also wants us to reject what is bad. If you are talking about denominations, then keep in mind that denominations were created by man...including yours. God and Jesus did not create churches.|`|f5c19a6ec11055d423269c8c414f59f1aa	There cannot be two truths.  Either Allah is the true God or someone else.  Either there is a hell or death is the end of it all.<br>  Either Jesus is a first creation of God or he is God.<br>  Would God have accepted Noah's religion if it was full of pagan beliefs and they accepted it into his religion because it is a fun thing to do.<br>  There was a whole world of different religions when Noah was on earth and only his worship was accepted.<br>  John 17:3?This means everlasting life, their taking in knowledge of you, the only true God, and of the one whom you sent forth, Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  So wouldn't the reverse be true also?<br>  If you did not take in accurate knowledge then you would not have eternal life.|`|jYBgBcZGaa	I agree. People should not put down other religions. There is, by no means, anyway that everyone will have the opinion about anything. Religion is a deep topic and if all people can't even agree on or persuade each other on what their favorite movie or book should be how can anyone think that they can do that with religion?|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Well, by believing in other religions, the believer is implying that he/she does not believe in your/other people's religions.<br>  <br>  Some people just can't stand that. Hence wars, crucification, burning at the stake, etc.|`|4dXcZhuTaa	correct, i personally believe in God.<br>  <br>  I don't believe it matters "which" God you believe in.. because in all honesty I think God is called by many names.<br>  =)|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Primitive man lived a life of superstitious bondage to religious fear. Modern, civilized men dread the thought of falling under the dominance of strong religious convictions. Thinking man has always feared to be held by a religion. When a strong and moving religion threatens to dominate him, he invariably tries to rationalize, traditionalize, and institutionalize it, thereby hoping to gain control of it. By such procedure, even a revealed religion becomes man-made and man-dominated. Modern men and women of intelligence evade the religion of Jesus because of their fears of what it will do to them--and with them. And all such fears are well founded. The religion of Jesus does, indeed, dominate and transform its believers, demanding that men dedicate their lives to seeking for a knowledge of the will of the Father in heaven and requiring that the energies of living be consecrated to the unselfish service of the brotherhood of man.<br>  <br>  The many religions are all good to the extent that they bring man to God and bring the realization of the Father to man. It is a fallacy for any group of religionists to conceive of their creed as The Truth; such attitudes bespeak more of theological arrogance than of certainty of faith. There is not a religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths contained in every other faith, for all contain truth. Religionists would do better to borrow the best in their neighbors' living spiritual faith rather than to denounce the worst in their lingering superstitions and outworn rituals. Page 1012-4<br>  <br>   The philosophic elimination of religious fear and the steady progress of science add greatly to the mortality of false gods; and even though these casualties of man-made deities may momentarily befog the spiritual vision, they eventually destroy that ignorance and superstition which so long obscured the living God of eternal love. The relation between the creature and the Creator is a living experience, a dynamic religious faith, which is not subject to precise definition. To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion. And this is just why the God of worship claims all allegiance or none. Page 1124-3

JAZntDd1aa	It's called manners. Girls like to be girls. Guys like to be guys. We like to be more well mannered.

jpTl3o5naa	I am a born again Christian and as one, it is my duty to tell others about Jesus. You can either accept it or reject it. I don't put others down for their beliefs, but I have been bashed many times in R&S and it gets disheartening and is hurtful. I will read yours and accept your right to believe what you want. Will you accept mine? I will not follow Satan, as I detest him, but will not bash you either, like most of us Christians are.|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	Because they are ignoring the fact that the Bible tells us God's Kingdom is not an earthly one.  Prop. 8 in California is an example of Mormons, Catholics, etc. using their religious beliefs to corrupt our State Constitution to permit discrimination against law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans.  Because these groups demand the special right to discriminate does not mean they can force their beliefs down everyone else's throat.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Nope|`|7mhRDbvsaa	nope|`|AA12383652	I find at least one atheist a week to tie up and force my religion upon!<br>  <br>  Michael<br>  Yes, you are allowed to force any laws you want on the public but if anyone else does it then they are wrong!<br>  <br>  You really really really need to take a Constitutional law class because everytime you post something on Prop 8 you show your complete ignorance of US law!<br>  <br>  Everytime a law passes then one group has imposed their will on the side that lost.  DUH<br>  Its just wrong when your side loses but perfectly ok when you side wins, right?<br>  <br>  eyes rolling|`|MVY8xhXlaa	I never force anything on anyone.

That is the idea that you cannot force anyone to have any belief against their will.  You cannot be forced to worship against your conscience.<br>  <br>  However, Bible believing Christians are commanded by Christ to SHARE the good news of the gospel with the whole world.  Whether you accept Christ or not is up to you.  The consequences of that decision are yours alone to bear.<br>  <br>  However, Christians know the joy, peace and love we experience from God.  We know the joy of having all your sins forgiven.  We know the peace that we have in Christ that passes all understanding or speculative rationalizations of others.  We rejoice to be able to share our faith.  <br>  <br>  The Bible is God's Word.  God's Holy Spirit inspired it.  It has spiritual power.  It has convicting power.  That is why some people react the way they do when Christians talk about their faith and the Bible.  It is powerful stuff that shakes you to the core of your being and convicts you of your sin and the powerful truth that it communicates.  <br>  <br>  That is why nonbelievers feel forced -the Word of God is convicting them of their sin and showing them their need of Christ as their personal Savior from sin.  It is the power of God's Word and the Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  But again, we are commanded by Christ to share our faith.  Some are personally offensive in their sharing. That is the problem of that person, not the Bible, not the message, not the Holy Spirit who convicts of sin, judgment and righeousness.|`|LlXH8yGcaa	Sometimes I subtly hint that the stab wound I just inflicted on you is totally cool because you're totally going to Valhalla, guy.

0lnamekJaa	Yes... Most of them can't even spell the word properly...<br>  <br>  Theists make it out to be a psudo-religion for people that have low self esteem or something stupid like that...<br>  <br>  "The Greek word αθεοι (atheoi), as it appears in the Epistle to the Ephesians (2:12) on the early 3rd-century Papyrus 46. It is usually translated into English as "[those who are] without God"."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist</a><br>  Atheism, as an explicit position, can be either the assertion that there are no deities,[1] or the rejection of theism.[2] It is also[3] defined more broadly as an absence of belief in deities, or nontheism.[4]<br>  <br>  Many self-described atheists are skeptical of all supernatural beings and cite a lack of empirical evidence for the existence of deities. Others argue for atheism on philosophical, social or historical grounds. Although many self-described atheists tend toward secular philosophies such as humanism[5] and naturalism,[6] there is no one ideology or set of behaviors to which all atheists adhere;[7] and some religions, such as Jainism and Buddhism, do not require belief in a personal god.<br>  <br>  The term atheism originated as a pejorative epithet applied to any person or belief in conflict with established religion.[8][9] With the spread of freethought, scientific skepticism, and criticism of religion, the term began to gather a more specific meaning and has been increasingly used as a self-description by atheists.|`|iJzlRCkOaa	I wouldn't say most people, but I'd say a lot of people are confused about it.

YX4y4vCfaa	I don't see how life after death can work.

Death is a natural part of life, the end of consciousness. There is no need or reason to believe that life can somehow continue on after our brains shut down.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	I don't think there's life after death, that just sounds like a story made up to quell fear of the unknown.

Where were you? What did you do? Did you have fun? Was it enjoyable in any form or way?<br>  <br>  Pretty much, you've been dead for billions of years before you were born, and you will be dead for billions of years after. The afterlife was created to give people hope for themselves (my life here on earth sucks, it'll be better after I'm dead), and to give them peace of mind (daddy died, went to a better place). <br>  <br>  In reality, there is nothing.  You've got about 80 or so years on earth to make the best of it. Keep in mind that time is relative as well.<br>  <br>  Time is an artificial unit of measurement created by carbon based lifeforms to measure the rate of their own decay.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I view the world as a natural experience with scientific laws and consequences for our actions.  I view it as a human dominated society with rules that make it more manageable and fair.  I view it as each person having their individual lives and each person is responsible for their own experiences.  I do not believe in fairness and it is a roll of the dice where you are born and the advantages you have.  Good or bad, you have to deal with the life you have.  When you die, it is over, so your time on earth should be cherished and you should live your life how you want because when you die, there is no afterlife.  You just stop living and decay and you know nothing forever.|`|BYTrrqN6aa	How do I view the world? As a place I live, filled with some of the most beautiful things.

In that order.|`|YieY5Ddpaa	The only reason we think is we have a brain - no soul, nothing. Our consciousness comes from out head completely. So when we die, and out brains die, poof! There goes our consciousness.|`|XuO2rTteaa	Personally, I consider myself to be an atheist. My opinion mirrors that of science, in science, everything is wrong until proven right. <br>  <br>  We know the repetitive process of crystallization, controlled electromagnetically, created a snow flake because it is the best explanation for the snow flake. We know the collapse of an accretion disk created a planet because it is the best explanation for that planet. DNA replication sustains life, abiogenesis creates life, gravity creates galaxies and clusters of galaxies, the strong force creates atoms, the weak force creates radiation, nebulae create stars, energy creates matter, evolution creates biodiversity, etc. We accept these answers because they have all been observed and are the best answers. They always create the same things, and what they always create are always created by them. All these happen over and over again with no variation. We don't know how the universe was ultimately formed, but we know what it contains was not designed, so there is more of a reason to assume it wasn't designed than to assume it was. One day we may find an answered to that. The nebula form naturally, and they naturally form stars. The star's accretion forms the planets, and the order gets more and more complex as time goes on. The universe is truly a painting that paints itself. <br>  <br>  I don't think life has a given purpose. There seems to be no purpose to life when it begins. Only humans seem to need a purpose to live, an only matured humans at that. Nether animals nor babies need a purpose, they can just "be", because they aren't Intelligent enough for such thought. When you look at the universe you realize that the animals and babies are far more correct than the Religious. Life, and the universe, at it's core, has no purpose, no good, no evil, just blind pity less indifference. However, you have to be aware of all parts of the Universe. Humans are the only creatures that need a purpose. Humans are part of he Universe, and therefor are the universe. If a human puts purpose on their own life than that's the only purpose they are going to have, but that's still part the Universe establishing a purpose. <br>  <br>  Carl Sagan said it best when he stated, "We are star stuff. We are a way for the universe to know itself." <br>  <br>  The purpose I gave myself is to search for the truth. I know I don't know the truth, and that keeps me going. My goal is like that of society. A society tries to reach utopia, however everybody knows that the incredible variation of opinion prevents any society from reaching this goal, but continuously trying to obtain it allows the society to improve. My utopia is truth, I know I can't obtain it, but trying grants improvement. <br>  <br>  I know that the universe is very beautiful. I see many things as they truly are. By that I mean this. <br>  <br>  Look at this picture. <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.uu.nl/~anders/Images/AstroImages/07_Mice_Galaxies.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.uu.nl/~anders/Images/As...</a> <br>  <br>  It's beautiful, isn't it? Its a picture of NGC 4676, or the Mice Galaxies. You can see a tail to the right of the two. This tail is several million light years across, and contains several billion planets. Many of the systems with the planets have been thrown into one another due to the interacting galaxies. Many of those planets probably had life. A few planets among billions, with billions of lives, destroyed by an uncontrollable event. At first glance, the picture is beautiful, but beauty can be a devastating disguise. I don't bring it upon myself to add to the destruction already taking place. I prefer to watch, than to interact, other than the occasional bit of knowledge, or ideal that I share with a person. I guess this is where I get my morality. I don't like to see beautiful things get destroyed, so preservation is what my emotions tell me is right. <br>  <br>  On the note of death, it seems to me rather obvious what happens. I imagine it will be akin to what it was like before you were born. Emotionless, knowledge-less, and everything was beside your interest. I personally don't remember caring about not being alive before, so I don't think it will matter to me when I'm not alive again. If I'm wrong, than I know for now that based on my past experience, this is the most likely scenario. I'm glad that the particular set of atoms that make me up, only for a glimpse in the universe, came together. I don't consider it luck, as I would have existed regardless, just not as a human, but being in this form has allowed me to now the universe, and therefore, myself. No matter what happens, I think having to die is a far dwarfed price, for having been able to live. <br>  <br>  Do I know god, no. I'm far too busy caring about what I can actually tell is real. Not caring about the atheist cliche, I ask, would you love unicorns, fairies, the FSM? You can't disprove any of them, and none of them have ever been evidentially proven. Like I said in the beginning, my opinion is like science, everything is wrong until proven right.|`|isRDHbJgaa	To be honest, no one knows, but based on that I can tell, we just decompose and live on in the memories of those who can still recall us and seize to exist as they pass on. There is no "life" after death, I think many people, not only Christians, are afraid of, not death, but to seize to exist; but I view it as a natural process. <br>  <br>  I love life and I love living but I know it will all come to an end, I am not delusional or need to believe fairy tales to "lead" me to do the right thing to get to "heaven".

I am born, survive off of what grows in and on this earth, when I die, I am buried in the ground in a biodegradable box, and become worm food, and fertilizer, and then I help grow food for someone else.  The concept of life after death is just a silly fairy tale in my eyes.|`|hrmJaGWCaa	The world is a very small part of a large universe that has room in it for many different things none of which include god[s] or goddess[es] .<br>  <br>  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic .<br>  Clarke's law<br>  <br>  As for an afterlife it is only speculation .|`|ki3XY49daa	The answer is simple.  There are a number of things that could happen after death.  You have different types of atheists.  Some believe that you die and decompose and that's the end of it.  Some of us look at things from a scientific point of view and think that since we are all made up of energy, the energy remains on the earth, thus explaining ghosts and such.  Then you have atheists like me who will tell you they honestly don't know what to think.|`|lprYy9RGaa	As a fellow Christian I worked with many atheist and have a friend who is one. <br>  Now this is hard. Ok...If I was one I would think that I would be able to do anything I wanted, as long as I wasn't caught, and if I was I'd probably kill the person,(no morals right? no Guiding Force?).. no Creative ideas because I didn't believe in God who IS the creator...<br>  What to look forward to when I went home... after a while all I look forward to is a permanent dirt nap.|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	In those wee hours of the night before I drift off to sleep, or sitting at the bus stop, or when I'm sitting on the toilet... Okay, basically any time I'm left alone with my thoughts, the mind drifts off to those kinds of questions.<br>  <br>  Up until a few years ago, I could say to myself, "Well, I don't know where I'm going, but that's okay! Love will lead the way to my truth!" It sounds pretty lame when I read it back, but that's how I felt. A higher truth could be found in the chambers of the heart. You could've called me spiritual... which is a fancy way of saying that I never received a satisfying religion growing up, but I need to fill the void with something.<br>  <br>  And it was good. And I would smile, and be contented. Then I had a religious un-awakening. <br>  <br>  I'll spare the details, but things changed. I became an atheist. Now, I don't believe I go anywhere when I die. It's probably like falling asleep and not waking up. You don't even notice it. Then you decompose, and all of your theist loved ones put on suits and go to a church and fill themselves with comfort.<br>  <br>  I guess that's why I wear headphones when I'm on the John now. I accept the finite nature of life, but I'd be lying if I said it didn't bother me.<br>  <br>  The older you get, the faster time flies- like it's racing towards something. But in the end, it all just crashes into a heap and stops. So just enjoy what you've got while it's happening. Because it does end, and THIS life is all you can be sure of.<br>  <br>  Peace

8l8siZ3paa	Drug dealing, robbery, burglary, gang activity, (illegal) possession of arms, and prostitution? We could make your list longer, by adding to it bank robbery and white collar crime, for example. However, your list is pretty good!<br>  <br>  By definition, urban crime is crime that is more common in an urban area. However, urban areas are not uniform in their crime and enforcement activities. Therefore, if you find a list of most prevalent crimes in Washington, DC and Grand Rapids Michigan, respectively, the two lists won't be identical. <br>  <br>  Why? Because, for example, if we focus on robbery and homicide, we find that, first, local official sanctions appear to have significant deterrent effects on robbery offending: Cities with a high risk of jail incarceration produce disproportionately low robbery rates, regardless of both demographic attributes of offenders and other known determinants of criminality. Cities where the police make frequent arrests for public order offenses (e. g., disorderly conduct and driving under the influence) tend to have significantly lower rates of black adult robbery. In addition, cities located in states with a high risk of imprisonment tend to have lower rates of juvenile robbery offending. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the importance of family and marital disruption as determinants of both robbery and homicide. In general, cities with a high percentage of black and white households comprised of a married-couple family have low rates of black and white juvenile offending, respectively, while the divorce rate exhibits a strong positive effect on adult offending. Finally, the results confirm traditional sociological concerns with economic stratification, as cities characterized by racial income inequality, poverty, and low occupational status were shown to have significantly higher rates of robbery and homicide.<br>  ,.  <br>  These are some of the reasons why you couldn't find a complete list of urban crimes. Please keep in mind, urban crimes  depend on the specific urban area you're writing about..

When Jesus comes into our lives, we're highly incomplete and Jesus begins the process of completing the work of sanctification in us. Satan would try to throw Christians aside by convincing them that they have fallen at times, and sometime we fall (unintentionally). But wake up, pick up the cross and follow the leader. There should be good books on the doctrine of "Sanctification" that should be of assistance. Try them out, especially some puritan works.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is not by "repenting of sins" and not by baptism.  Water baptism cannot be added to Jesus's PERFECT salvation. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a free gift.  And once you believe in Jesus alone for salvation, then you are saved and going to heaven, PERIOD!  1 John 5:13. :)<br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|OBV4AKIXaa	Your on the verge of becoming a freethinker, don't let your religion stop you from using your mind to its full extent.<br>  <br>  Even if God was real He would have given you your mind don't you think He'd be upset if you didn't use it?|`|WuKI9WiVaa	Me too! it's not silly. to me at least. don't sweat. we're good.|`|j5YwuVEIaa	I hope this will encourage you. Use your own bible and when you pray, ask to find what is missing regarding his truth and the way in which to worship.<br>  <br>  One important reason why we should pray to Jehovah is that he invites us to do so. His Word encourages us: “Do not be anxious over anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication along with thanksgiving let your petitions be made known to God; and the peace of God that excels all thought will guard your hearts and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.” (Philippians 4:6,?7) Surely we would not want to ignore such a kind provision made for us by the Supreme Ruler of the universe!<br>  4 Another reason to pray is that regularly praying to Jehovah is a way to strengthen our relationship with him. True friends do not communicate only when they need something. Rather, good friends are interested in each other, and their friendship becomes stronger as they freely express their thoughts, concerns, and feelings. In some respects, the situation is similar when it comes to our relationship with Jehovah God. With the help of this book, you have learned much about what the Bible teaches regarding Jehovah, his personality, and his purposes. You have come to know him as a real person. Prayer gives you the opportunity to express your thoughts and innermost feelings to your heavenly Father. As you do, you draw closer to Jehovah.—James 4:8.<br>  <br>  <br>  To whom should we pray? Jesus taught his followers to pray to “our Father in the heavens.” (Matthew 6:9) Our prayers, then, must be directed only to Jehovah God. However, Jehovah requires that we acknowledge the position of his only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ. As we learned in Chapter?5, Jesus was sent to the earth to serve as a ransom to redeem us from sin and death. (John 3:16; Romans 5:12) He is the appointed High Priest and Judge. (John 5:22; Hebrews 6:20) Hence, the Scriptures direct us to offer our prayers through Jesus. He himself said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.” (John 14:6) For our prayers to be heard, we must pray only to Jehovah through his Son.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  No, you are not being silly.<br>  <br>  Everyone experiences doubts - even I (in my 70's) have doubts at times.<br>  <br>  What I do is pray the Holy Spirit will convict me of all my sins, so I can repent<br>  and then ask for forgiveness from them<br>  <br>  IT IS THAT SIMPLE <br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|zMcHYQeBaa	That is Satan injecting thoughts of doubt into your mind.

There is a lot of easy believism being taught but if you study, you find Jesus saying in Mt 7:21  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.<br>  <br>  Read Rev 2 and 3. What you believe is paramount also.<br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you that to fear God is of Satan. Fear, right fear tendeth to your good.

bmoCpcdraa	THE MOIRAI (or Moirae) were the goddesses of fate who personified the inescapable destiny of man. They assinged to every person his or her fate or share in the scheme of things. Their name means "Parts." "Shares" or "Alottted Portions." Zeus Moiragetes, the god of fate, was their leader,.<br>  Klotho, whose name meant 'Spinner', spinned the thread of life. Lakhesis, whose name meant 'Apportioner of Lots'--being derived from a word meaning to receive by lot--, measured the thread of life. Atropos (or Aisa), whose name meant 'She who cannot be turned', cut the thread of life.<br>  At the birth of a man, the Moirai spinned out the thread of his future life, followed his steps, and directed the consequences of his actions according to the counsel of the gods. It was not an inflexible fate; Zeus, if he chose, had the power of saving even those who were already on the point of being seized by their fate. The Fates did not abruptly interfere in human affairs but availed themselves of intermediate causes, and determined the lot of mortals not absolutely, but only conditionally, even man himself, in his freedom was allowed to exercise a certain influence upon them. As man's fate terminated at his death, the goddesses of fate become the goddesses of death, Moirai Thanatoio.<br>  The Moirai were independent, at the helm of necessity, directed fate, and watched that the fate assigned to every being by eternal laws might take its course without obstruction; and Zeus, as well as the other gods and man, had to submit to them. They assigned to the Erinyes, who inflicted the punishement for evil deeds, their proper functions; and with them they directed fate according to the laws of necessity.<br>  As goddesses of birth, who spinned the thread of life, and even prophesied the fate of the newly born, Eileithyia was their companion. As goddesses of fate they must necessarily have known the future, which at times they revealed, and were therefore prophetic deities. Their ministers were all the soothsayers and oracles.<br>  As goddesses of death, they appeared together with the Keres and the infernal Erinyes.<br>  The Moirai were described as ugly old women, sometimes lame. They were severe, inflexible and stern. Klotho carries a spindle or a roll (the book of ate), Lakhesis a staff with which she points to the horoscope on a globe, and Atropos a scroll, a wax tablet, a sundial, a pair of scales, or a cutting instrument. At other times the three were shown with staffs or sceptres, the symbols of dominion, and sometimes even with crowns. At the birth of each man they appeared spinning, measuring, and cutting the thread of life.<br>  The Romans called the goddess Parcae and named the three Nona, Decuma and Morta

KBBonf97aa	It's normal and common for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions that have nothing to do with what will ultimately become your sexual orientation.  It has to do with elevated hormone levels, which have caused girls to question their sexuality since the beginning of time.<br>  <br>  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, but most girls who do this are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary.  That's why there are so many teenagers who identify as bisexual, but very few who don't identify as straight or gay by the time they're in their 20s or older.  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all of the girls who considered themselves bisexual as teens grew up to be happily heterosexual.  And the hipness of bisexuality actually makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in fashion.  Very often they're used by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being gay.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will tell you to experiment with both guys and girls and then decide your orientation, but that will probably confuse you more.  Any person can enjoy physical stimulation from another person, male or female, and it has nothing to do with sexual orientation.  A gay man doesn't turn bisexual or straight if he has sex with a woman any more than a lesbian becomes bisexual or straight from sleeping with a man.  The acts are just acts and anyone can do them and enjoy them.  But sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent.  Nobody gets to "decide" what it is, no matter how fashionable a particular orientation may be.  And sexual orientation often doesn't make itself clear until late adolescence or early adulthood.  That's why most teens who think they're bisexual realize later that they were wrong.<br>  <br>  Don't stick yourself with a label, since the odds are huge it won't apply to you in a few years.  I have a friend who announced she was bisexual at 15 because she was attracted to other girls.  By the time she entered college, she knew she was straight.  More than a decade later, there are still people who won't let her forget that she came to a very wrong conclusion when she was a confused kid fighting an epic battle with teenage hormones.  And she's the first to admit she never would have declared herself bisexual if it hadn't been considered cool to do so.<br>  <br>  If you've always liked guys and the attraction to girls started during adolescence, chances are you're completely straight and you're just going through normal hormonal turmoil.  The good thing about sexual orientation is that it always sorts itself out over time.  Just be patient and let nature do the work for you.  In a few years, you'll know exactly who you were meant to be.|`|vAwzvNgzaa	Thats an easy yes.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	Tell you what.

Nor have I gotten any crushes on them.<br>  <br>  But I do like a lot of girls in both sexual and friendly ways. I think I'm a lesbian but I'm not exactly sure though.<br>  <br>  I think it's either I've never met the right guy or I'll never love a guy. More likely on the latter.<br>  <br>  So with you I conclude that you're a bisexual.<br>  <br>  Since your thoughts and feelings for the girl are persistent while you're still open to a relationship with a guy.<br>  <br>  Bisexuals usually have one more dominant preference for a partner. Some bisexuals prefer guys best while they're still on for a lady.|`|sE09AS76aa	as of right now you are curious so i say...this happened to me last year February(major crush on a girl). and ever since then it just wasn't that one girl i was attracted to. i have been attracted too more girls. but give yourself time and you will find out more about yourself :)|`|jS6WNDhSaa	I would say bi-curious.

And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the tribes of the children of Israel." (Revelation 7:3-4)<br>  <br>  "And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads." (Revelation 9:3-4)<br>  <br>  "And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty [and] four thousand, having his Father's name written in their foreheads." (Revelation 14:1) <br>  <br>  "...the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins." (Revelation 14:3-4)<br>  <br>  Comment<br>  Here we have the great future destruction where billions of people will die. Only 144,000 virgin Jews with a protective mark on their heads will survive. (I suppose the 'Jews for Jesus' cult would serve as the leading candidates.)<br>  <br>  How many believers realize that this means the death of everyone on earth but a few virgin Jews? And this includes the destruction of all Christians! (Of course the alleged Jesus, a virgin Jew, who claimed only a few would enter heaven would agree with this).<br>  <br>    Note: Of course faithful Christians cannot accept the 144,000 figure so they must either become atheists, ignore these verses, reject Revelation as just dream nonsense, or try to revise its meaning to something they can accept. Some try to get creative by claiming that Rev. 7:-9,"...a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues...," means an unlimited number will enter heaven. Not so. The "all" in this verse speaks about all the tribes of Israel (the Jews) scattered around the nations of the world. The verse comes right after listing the tribes in Rev. 7:1-8. And man doesn't name the number but rather the angel who speaks in John's dream. And John reports the number, three times, in chapters 7 and 14, as shown above. Sorry Christians but all of you will have to suffer with all the atheists and unbelievers in God's hell. Welcome to the club! <br>  <br>  Beware of a future "Armageddon" caused by religious people.

The Muslims had no problem anymore because they are now the descendants of Ishmael the first born of Abraham. The Jews had a little problem because they rejected their own Son Jesus. They had been chosen by God to be the way for His One and Only Son as Redeemer of His people but they failed God. So God had to discipline them. They have to undergo cleansing many times in order to accept Jesus as the One they pierced. Their conversion is at hand. This was prophesied by Zechariah and other Old testament Prophets. Zechariah 12:7-14. Christianity is the religion founded by Jesus Christ Himself in Jerusalem. The early Christians were persecuted but this had not hindered their growth. Christianity flourished into the whole world and this prompted Satan to use it as a tool against the followers of Jesus Christ and of God. He used Constantine the Great an ambitious soldier to adopt Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. So Christians and Rome united in one common religion. But God is not pleased with such because of idolatry. Roman pagan practices were merged into Christian beliefs and doctrines. Even important doctrines of the primitive Christianity were changed by Constantine the Great. The Sabbath which was Saturday was changed to Sunday the day in which they worshiped their Sun God. But what God hated most was idolatry. So He called the Prophet Muhammad and Islam was founded against the veneration of icons or idols. These resulted in the Iconoclasm of the 8th and 9th centuries AD. Then the Reformation of Martin Luther , the German monk which was the beginning of Protestantism. But Protestants just followed the Sunday Law. So a Baptist preacher William Miller was called by God to get the attention of the whole world about the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. His calculation missed but the result was the founding of the Seventh-day Adventist church by James White and his wife Ellen H. White, a Methodist and Joseph Bates a Seventh-day Baptist. Their church was God's instruments to gather believers whose purpose is to show to the world that they are the true remnant of the Christian church. They stressed the importance of obeying the Ten Commandments and bearing the testimony of Jesus Christ. Revelation 12: 17 and Revelation 14:12 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. So this is the mark of a true Christian. You can confirm this from History books or Encyclopedia. Not all Christians are going to heaven unless they have the mark of the true church. God will gather all the children of Abraham before the Second Coming of the Messiah. So Jews, Muslims and Christians will be united in the Name of God. Jews descendants of Jacob, Muslims of Ishmael and Christians adopted children of Abraham through Christ.

It means to "put down" more in the sense of "make fun of", "belittle", "call someone a fool", etc. <br>  <br>  So, unless your trying to "make fun of (put down)" your foot then I don't think that "Put your foot down" is the translation you are looking for here.|`|OwWUkHuQaa	Hello, I am a Japanese.<br>  What context that phrase was used in?<br>  I have never heard such a expression.

lUe4rReZaa	Shortly after I bought my house I was at the neighborhood Blockbuster to rent a movie, when I gave the clerk my address, she said she knew the old owners, and that they swore the house was haunted.  I didn't think much of it, but odd things did start to happen, Radios I know I turned off were on when I came back, a picture on the wall I hung on a wood screw left by the last owner kept falling down, and an antique clock I had not wound in years started chiming on it's own.  While these things were weird, and not easily explained, they were never harmful, or very frightening.  It all stopped shortly after I hung a crucifix my father bought me as a gift from his trip to the holy land, on the screw where the picture had hung.<br>  Several months later I found out from some neighbors that something very tragic had happened in the house, years before, but it was so horrible none of them would tell me what had happened, they just said you don't want to know.

She bumped into the wall and knocked down all of the picture frames--except the one with a picture of my friend and her grandmother. A while after, more creepy stuff started happening to them.

Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes. A brief discussion of the human digestive system and then the probable vampire population given an exponential growth rate should explain why vampires are not possible. <br>  <br>  2. The human body is not designed to process large amounts of blood for nutrition. There is not enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats present in blood to maintain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. When a human ingests food it is first broken up into a bolus by chewing, then churned up in the stomach with digestive juices to form a mass called chyme. It then passes through the pylorus into the duodenum, part of the small intestine where it mixes with bile salts and secretions from the pancreas and liver which continue breaking it down on a molecular basis, mostly affecting fats at this point. The broken down nutrients pass through the wall of the intestines and into the bloodstream where they are carried to each cell or stored for later use. Indigestible bulk continues through the intestines, turning a dark brown from the bile. Water is absorbed from this mass in the large intestine depending on the needs of the body - a well-hydrated person will usually have a softer stool than a dehydrated person will. Water also enters the bloodstream, and this is what helps to maintain blood pressure. The pressure tends to balance itself in a healthy person because the bloodstream goes through a formation in the kidney called the Loop of Henle, where the narrowing blood vessel forces excess water and cellular waste such as urea out through the cellular wall into the kidneys, where it is excreted through the ureters into the bladder, and then out of the body via the urethral passageway.<br>  <br>  3. IMPORTANT - A person physically unable to process his own food for nutrition therefore also could not process blood - it's the same process. Ingested blood does not transmit directly to the veins anyway - it would be chemically broken down by the digestive system.<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical ingestion of blood to supply these nutrients would therefore have to occur at least once a day, and would require the ingestion of the entire blood supply which could not happen as the stomach is far too small to hold that much liquid volume. Hold up your clenched fist - under normal conditions your stomach is about that size. Furthermore, such a mass would be difficult to pass thru the intestines as it has no fibrous bulk, would create an intestinal impaction, causing massive vomiting from the large concentration of iron present, and any "real" vampire would have to eventually expel the waste, which would come out as a black, tarry, smelly goo, just as stool does when blood is present from a upper GI bleed. <br>  <br>  5. These humans that affect the whole "vampiric lifestyle" are NOT vampires. They are simply humans playing their own little game, in their own little fantasy world, usually pandering to their own little sexual fetish, which may or may not actually be sexual. I too, play my own little game, in the SCA, but mine is a game where the deeds that I do are determined by the strength of my arm and sword - I am a warrior, with just as much skill and ability as any warrior of ancient times. The difference is that I am claiming to be something physically possible: a warrior, and I prove it everytime I strap on my armor and walk onto a SCA battlefield. The so-called "vampires" are claiming to be something physically impossible: a walking corpse, and all they prove is that black Victorian clothing, a pair of false fangs, and a little makeup make for a good Halloween costume - it does not make you a vampire.<br>  <br>  6. Even if a vampire feeds once a week, and his victim also becomes a vampire, that is exponential growth, with four iterations a month. First iteration: One makes one, total two. Second iteration: Two make two, total four. Third iteration: Four make four, total eight. Fourth iteration: Eight make eight, total sixteen. 16 vampires at the end of one month, 256 at the end of the second month, 4096 by the end of the third month, 65,536 by the end of the fourth month, 1,048,476 at the end of the fifth, and 33,572,832 vampires at the end of half a year! By way of comparison, there are currently approximately 33 million people who have HIV/AIDS and the disease is a world-wide epidemic. I see people every day in the hospital with AIDS, but never has there been one documented case of a vampire attack. Do the math - vampires are a mathematical impossibility. As for the idea that vampires existed "a long time ago" consider the estimated global population 5,000 years ago - using the above mathematical rationale, a single vampire converted every human on the globe in less than two years. This falls therefore, under the logic of Occam's Razor - which states that when you have removed every impossible answer, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth. Since there is no "vampiric plague" swarming the earth, the logical deduction is that they don't exist.<br>  <br>  7. Point of clarification about "vampire" bats: vampire is simply the name we have given them because they do drink blood, same as a flea, mosquito, leech, or spider. Are these creatures vampires? No. They are living creatures, not legendary monsters. They can subsist on blood because of their smaller size and proportionately larger stomach volume. Drinking blood does not make you a vampire anymore than eating raw meat makes you a werewolf, although it might make you a mosquito.<br>  <br>  8.The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.<br>  <br>  9. There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent. The idea that there is a global "vampire community" engaging in controlled breeding to keep the "bloodline pure" is delusional in the extreme.<br>  <br>  10. There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.|`|rBTxIbh0aa	i say no hesitantly with every thing on this planet we have yet to discover its not imposable but i don't believe in the immortal "blood sucking.. garlic hating, monsters that you cant see in the mirror..." as u put it but there have been ppl in the past that embraced the idea that human blood made u live longer i forget her name but there was a women of noble berth that would bath her self in human blood in the belief that it kept her skin and body young.....and there is a disses that affect the body dont remember the name but it effect some thing in the bod stoping u form makeing a certain chemecal with out it the body ages realy fast and u get sores and stuff a way of combating the disses is to take blood transfusions that with out they would die witch in esseince makes them vampires|`|9s2pggXHaa	In your additional details you mention that you will "have an open mind until someone can prove that they are or they aren't."

She said the blood sugar would get so low that they would pass out and it was like they were dead, but then their body would re regulate and they would be back to normal, almost as if they came back from the dead. it was interesting actually. That wasn't the main plot in the book though.|`|hp3jwWPVaa	Yes.....i am one...i noticed it 5 years ago....when i started staying up at night...sleeping ALOT during the day....and i CRAVED blood... (seriously i dont believe in the crap they feed us on TV) i noticed that i have always been ill...mentally and kinda physically....if you listen you cant hear my heart VERY well, and i have physic dreams....i see what's going ot happen the next day and it usually 80% of the time happens thought it was nothing a disease but then i started looking into it i found a non-fiction book about vampires that a real vampire wrote.... i talked to the doctor...(without telling him i thought i was a vampire) and then he said there was nothing wrong i tested myself and i am a vampire and i am not afraid to admit...of course i have a blood sister (not my true sister) no she's my vampire cult sister....she's not a strongly opinionated as i am about it and she hides it.... back to the main idea...... yes i do believe in vampires....my age doesnt matter.|`|DW7yIUAJaa	Do you?|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	No.|`|JWjq5iaXaa	vampires? No. I really, really doubt vampires exist. Zombies are more realistic than vampires, email me and I'll explain. I won't explain in this answer because the answer isn't about zombies.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	So far, I only have knowledge of the Psychic vampires, and I doubt the media ones. This type of Vampirism is something you are born with. Genetic, I believe. However, one is not aware of it until they reach an Awakening, which normally occurs around 15-16. No superpowers or anything. They are technically human, yes humans, that have an energy deficiency and have to get 'extra' energy from someone else. There's the psychic kind, which feed on a person's energy. There's also the actually blood drinkers that get the it from donors. They can be beautiful, but it depends on genetics, just like any other human. They can be strong, but they have to work at it, like any other human. They don't have a phobia of garlic or anything. Get the point?<br>  My age, however, is private.|`|jLL7sDILaa	Yes, I do. Because I am one. Mortal, reflective, and all. And I'm 19. I've been studying real vampires for about three years now.|`|bFHkEGoCaa	I'm a vampire age 16 <br>  drinks blood<br>  love garlic<br>  and can myself in the mirror<br>  and no were not some illness<br>  well some say were the next step in evolution|`|AA11605393	No such things as vampires either.

I see ghosts a lot. I never understood why ghosts walk this earth, there could be dozens of reasons:<br>  <br>  1. Choice<br>  2. Looking for something<br>  3. Cannot go to heaven until purpose is fulfilled<br>  4. Split between Heaven and Hell<br>  5. Lost soul<br>  6.

Do you really think that in the the past century that we've had decent equipment to verify their existence and accepted the scientific method as a means of verifying claims, that no one would have ever had any proof AT ALL that ghosts exist.  What are ghosts made of?  If you say they are only energy, you are very ignorant of scientific fact.  If you say they are matter, then why have they as of yet been undetectable.  It's really almost as detestable as the whole angel bullshiite.  It may be very interesting and even fun to learn about, and its certainly fun to go to haunted places and do 'Weird NJ' stuff.  However, don't ever assert that these things are anything more than a something that entertains people and keeps [(some of) this is not meant to be derisive, btw] them sane and give them hope.  Ghosts simply can't exist.  Always remember though, that life without fun and fantasy is not living.|`|9GywK3mBaa	Yeah, I do.<br>  Because I love all that kind of stuff: Ghosts, Vampires, ect...<br>  I guess you could say I'm a dark person.<br>  I'm 13.|`|9C0thBTzaa	I'm 17..and yes i believe in ghosts,but not those in horror movies..after all, once a person died, where would you think the soul will go??|`|fe56d27a01fe95275a72aee2ba4937cdaa	Yes, I do.

ZmdIlkpQaa	Most do not, however, Mexicans are drawn from several racial groups, including Irish, Anglos and Spanish in addition to the many Native tribes.  There are also lots of smaller minority European groups that have immigrated to Mexico over the years.  There are considerable numbers of red haired, light skinned and green eyed Spanish people in the Celtic North West of that country, and there are certainly lots of light skinned, green eyed Irish, for example.  It would tend to indicate that you descend from a largely European blood line which is not much mixed with Native Mexican blood.|`|EmOnt7FIaa	Most Mexicans that I see have tan/brown skin with brown eyes.|`|6ac013da2dceabac6383ebdee4f828c0aa	Spanish ancestry.<br>  <br>  I had a friend who was 100% Mexican, with blonde hair, blue eyes and lighter skin than mine (I'm light beige with olive undertones).  I didn't believe it until she put her arm next to mine.<br>  <br>  My best friend is 100% Mexican and he is fair-skinned; very light with pink undertones.  He told me he has never tanned in his life--he burns and peels.  His eyes are brown, but his mom has green eyes and red hair.|`|LCdOocBAaa	What? NO Mexican has green eyes!<br>  Don't let colored contacts fool you.<br>  And if they do, they are definitely of a more spanish background.<br>  <br>  Edit: My eyes are green and that's because i'm white.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	I'm not sure I grasp the difference--you should ask this in the law category.  Neither are legally enforceable.  A reward is a promise but not legally enforceable.  In an invitation to treat, the inviter can change his/her mind.  So neither actually require the dog's owner to pay you the reward.<br>  <br>  Legally you can promise someone money but not pay and they cannot be held to a promise.  Plus in your example it would be difficult b/c the finder does not know in advance.  It would be different if the person offers a reward and so therefore you go out and look and find the dog.  Then you could say you had a verbal contract (dog=money) which would be a trade where both parties benefit.  But if you just find the dog and return it and are told there is a reward, you did not find the dog on the condition of the reward and it wouldn't be a contract.  So the person could just change their mind.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion though is it is a contract.  You offered the reward in good faith on the return of your dog.  If you had the dog returned, you should be obligated to pay.|`|spbqfjvbaa	Treat.

Hades is also the God of Wealth as he owes all of the items that are under the earth such as gold, silver, gemstones of all kinds.  So - his temple should be richly adorned.  The land around it should be desolate and dead; the trees are bare - like skeletons without leaves.  <br>  <br>  2.  As she dies, Medusa gives birth to what...?

But one day, Eve was near the tree. Then, an evil snake told Eve to eat the fruit, and she listened to the snake. She shared it with Adam.

They made them move out the garden, and live in a desert." <br>                the end<br>  <br>  If they heard that, it would be the equivalent of a fairy tale.<br>  If adults weren't so brainwashed by lies, maybe they could open their minds, and actually think how stupid this sounds.<br>  thank you.|`|BfnVCjh2aa	because God is only one of the million of other gods that came before him.

I don't know if you're a Christian challenging atheists or an atheist challenging Christians, but regardless, your question cannot be answered.  <br>  The question, "Does God exist?" is a question whose answer is reserved for those who believe that He does.  True believers and bondservants of Christ have the faith to see where God's hands are working and shaping their lives.  Faith is like a pair of spectacles.  When we first put them on, they are dirty and smudged, but we still get a greater glimpse of God's works.  As we consecrate and dedicate ourselves more and more to Him, He cleans our lenses more and more so that we may see more and more.  The dirt or smudge is sin and doubt, satan's work.  As we give ourselves to the Master, our former master's chains are broken, allowing us to completely bask in the Joy of our True Master.<br>  So does God exist?  Yes.  <br>  So why don't I see Him?  Because you don't want to love Him and give Him all of you.<br>  Why's there all this suffering?  Because man chose sin over Him and His is letting us live in the results of our violently selfish sin (namely governmental and political figures concerning famine, war, etc.)<br>  How can I know Him?  "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength, and with all your mind;"  Luke 10:27  &  "Seek first the Kingdom of God and all His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."  Matthew 6:33.  To Search for the Lord for He is your Master, to Love the Lord for He is your spouse, to Honor Him for His is your King, and to Praise Him for He is your Salvation.<br>  Amen; God's blessings to you all.|`|zQbY9Hoyaa	Dude...Tell me, what comes from nothing?  Answer: nothing.  Right?  Nothing comes from nothing.  So, something (i.e. your reality) comes from something.  Something must come from something, never nothing.  That first something is God.  God is the uncaused first cause.  He is the I Am...He has no beginning and no end, He just IS.  God created time and space for us, but He is not subject to either (except when He condescended to become human as Christ Jesus).  Believe in the big bang...evolution...whatever-tell me where any of it started.  God is the only answer.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your search and may God bless you with the answers you seek.|`|dbb5c505997521bf0fb0c2324de40111aa	Can you think of a computer, cellphone or a car that made itself or came through evolution? so how could you think of more complexe things like humanity, animals and the whole universe coming from nothing without having a creator.|`|AA11230150	The fact that no amputee in history has been granted the miracle of growing back a severed limb proves that there is no God.

fSlZQzS4aa	The Pope made the choice.|`|jard50Yiaa	óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez (August 15, 1917– March 24, 1980), commonly known as Archbishop Romero, was a bishop of the Roman Catholic Church in El Salvador. He became the fourth Archbishop of San Salvador, succeeding Luis Chávez.<br>  <br>  As archbishop, he witnessed ongoing violations of human rights and started a group which spoke out on behalf of the poor and victims of the Salvadoran civil war. In 1980, he was assassinated by a right-wing group headed by former major Roberto D'Aubuisson as he held the consecrated host up during a Mass. This provoked an international outcry for reform in El Salvador. After his assassination, Romero was succeeded by Monsignor Arturo Rivera.<br>  <br>  In 1997, a cause for beatification and canonization into sainthood was opened for Romero, and Pope John Paul II bestowed upon him the title of Servant of God. The process continues. He is considered by some the unofficial patron saint of the Americas and El Salvador and is often referred to as "San Romero" by the Catholic workers in El Salvador. Outside of Catholicism, Romero is honored by other religious denominations of Christendom, including the Church of England through its Common Worship. He is one of the ten 20th century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey, London. In 2008, he was chosen as one of the 15 Champions of World Democracy by the Europe-based magazine A Different View.

TdROahUnaa	I love greek myths!!<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  Tantalus is known for having been welcomed to Zeus' table in Olympus, like Ixion. There he too misbehaved, stole ambrosia and nectar, brought it back to his people,[5] and revealed the secrets of the gods.[6]<br>  <br>  Tantalus offered up his son, Pelops, as a sacrifice to the gods. He cut Pelops up, boiled him, and served him up as food for the gods. The gods were said to be aware of his plan for their feast, so they didn't touch the offering; only Demeter, distraught by the loss of her daughter, Persephone, "did not realize what it was" and ate part of the boy's shoulder. Fate, ordered by Zeus, brought the boy to life again (she collected the parts of the body and boiled them in a sacred cauldron), rebuilding his shoulder with one wrought of ivory made by Hephaestus and presented by Demeter.<br>  <br>  The revived Pelops was kidnapped by Poseidon and taken to Olympus. Later, Zeus threw Pelops out of Olympus due to his anger at Tantalus. The Greeks of classical times claimed to be horrified by Tantalus' doings; cannibalism, human sacrifice and parricide were atrocities and taboo. Tantalus was the founder of the cursed House of Atreus in which variations on these atrocities continued. Misfortunes also occurred as a result of these acts, making the house the subject of many Greek Tragedies.<br>  <br>  Tantalus' grave-sanctuary stood on Sipylus.[7] But hero's honours were paid him at Argos, where local tradition claimed to possess his bones.[8] On Lesbos, there was another hero-shrine in the little settlement of Polion and a mountain named for Tantalos.[9]<br>  <br>  Tantalus' punishment, now proverbial for temptation without satisfaction (the source of the English word "tantalizing"[10]), was to stand in a pool of water beneath a fruit tree with low branches. Whenever he reached for the fruit, the branches raised his intended meal from his grasp. Whenever he bent down to get a drink, the water receded before he could get any. Over his head towers a threatening stone, like that of Sisyphus.[11]<br>  <br>  In a different story, Tantalus was blamed for indirectly having stolen the dog made of gold created by Hephaestus (god of metals and smithing) for Rhea to watch over infant Zeus. Tantalus' friend Pandareus stole the dog and gave it to Tantalus for safekeeping. When asked later by Pandareus to return the dog, Tantalus denied that he had the dog, saying he "had neither seen nor heard of a golden dog." According to Robert Graves, this incident is why an enormous stone hangs over Tantalus' head. Others state that it was Tantalus who stole the dog, and gave it to Pandareus for safekeeping.<br>  <br>  There is a similarity between the names Tantalus and Hantili, the latter a name of two Hittite kings. Thus, there may be a loose historical connection between the mythical Tantalus and the Bronze Age Hittite kings, who likewise ruled over Asia Minor. In Robert Graves' historical novel, Hercules, My Shipmate, Graves appears to claim that Tantalus was a member of an invading Greek tribe who was condemned to his torment in Tartarus for refusing to reject his patriarchal deities in favor of a local version of Ashtoreth.

2e6d0bf8ecab06aa35b4c1cb6fa300d5aa	The “S” had to be a smudge, but the reason why they used the “X” was done before the crucifixion of Christ. Jesus didn’t say I am the Alpha and the Omega, he spoke Aramaic. He said I am the Aleph (1) and the Tau (400) Tau an Aramaic dialect of Hebrew, in Hebrew would be would be Tev (400) Aleph was the letter with the lowest numerical denomination attached (1) and Tev has the highest numerical denomination attached to it, thus the First and the Last. The letter Tau was represented by the symbol of a cross and it meant the end or completion. The mark on the forehead would mean you were marked complete.<br>  <br>  The Aramaic Aleph and Tau translated into Greek would be the Alpha and Omega (the Greek letters with the highest/lowest numerical denomination attached) though they both mean the First and Last, the Omega symbol is not a cross as is the Aramaic Tau, so some of the original symbolism got lost in translation.|`|1TYZDRUqaa	"SUPERMAN!"|`|crwV0sdKaa	It is supposed to be a +<br>  I got mine yesterday, and the ashes completely didn't look like they could be a +, although I know that when the priest was applying them, they were forming it in the shape of a cross.

87e7b956696278de07838481b900732caa	You make it inspirational by "humanizing" the participants; explain their backgrounds so the reasons behind their actions can be better understood. There was a purpose for the fight of the Alamo, and despite the fact that help didn't arrive in time, these brave men fought for their cause because it was something they believed in. William Travis and David Bowie in particular, had colorful lives. The account of Bowie being bedridden due to illness when Santana's men penetrated the walls of the Alamo, and how -in his dying state- still managed to fight many of them off, is admirable.

No where in the U.S. do we have old architecture. However France was probably the worst. The were so stuck up I couldn't stand it.|`|UzC9gsi0aa	Japanese.
9n4MpLwvaa	How about google? You'd get the answer quicker. <br>  <br>  Also, you need a specific Nation to research.|`|ErXKMHGAaa	Depends on the Nation...<br>  ...different Nations had different rituals, just as different religions have different rituals. Some Nations were polygamist, where as most were not...<br>  ...what Nation are you wanting to know about?<br>  <br>  Usually the Muskogee weddings happen during Busk to the day after (the end of June) as a renewal to the family. After the ceremony, the couple walk hand and hand around the sacred fire once. It isn't uncommon for the couple to give a flesh and blood offering (it's not as horrid as it seems, it's just a bit of skin taken off, similar to having a mole removed on each shoulder, one to four times, traditionally four times each shoulder though) to the sacred fire; as it burns, it goes back to the Master of Breath for a blessing on the marriage. Mothers of the couple also give an offering of flesh and blood.<br>  <br>  Our ceremonies are mainly Protestant now, but we still follow some of our old traditions afterward.<br>  <br>  My husband is Caucasian, and he did the tradtional flesh and blood offering with me, as did my mother; his mother did not as she did not believe in it.|`|YZnJDWAEaa	I suggest you try to contact one of your local tribe's elders or a tribal spokesperson. Let them know why you are asking. <br>  <br>  Having a respectful and accurate depiction of their culture and it's rituals is something most tribes would appreciate and support. Also remember, First American culture was and is vast a varied. What is true for the Algonquin, is not necessarily true for Lakota or Navajo.<br>  Saying "Native wedding" is like saying "Caucasian wedding".<br>  <br>  As a Wiccan, I would have the same feeling for someone depicting a  hand-fasting ceremony.<br>  <br>  Shana
33E9E96iaa	Well, Shapeshifters can be pretty much anything you want them to be as long as they follow the basic rules or shapeshifting:<br>  1. They have to have the same amount of mass ie: a 150 pound teenage boy can't turn into a 6 ounce kitten. Where does all the mass go?<br>  <br>  2. They must have their clothes still there, they do not  disappear.<br>  <br>  3. It's usually slowand  rather disgusting to watch. This rule is not static, though I highly suggest it. Stephanie Meyer ruined this rule forever to me.<br>  <br>  4. If it's an animal, they are usually simular looking.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	YOU N'WAH!<br>  <br>  DIE FETCHER!<br>  <br>  We're watching you....

GRowIsVIaa	The language they use in Iloilo is ilonggo but i'm sure they understand tagalog because the television channels only broadcast tagalog channels. There's no Tagalog language schools in Iloilo but you can search a private teacher so they can teach you tagalog. Usually it will cost $500 or less for a month learning tagalog language.
fzUP4IAwaa	Ok so you are 12 years old?<br>  <br>  Times are tough, everyone knows that. I think a $10 card for each guy would be enough. You don't want to make them feel obligated or uncomfortable but $10 would show them that you appreciate the invite and all that. <br>  <br>  And for the girl, if you can afford it, I think a $20 gift card would be just fine. Maybe for her fave store or one of her fave restaurants. <br>  <br>  Either way, it's a sweet thought, but for the guys, they aren't expecting you to bring them anything so the $10 i-tunes card would be quite a surprise, wouldn't it?<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck.|`|207dFmdHaa	at your age 10.00 for both of them|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	I'd say, if some people aren't giving gifts at the guys' party, give each of them a $20 or so gift card, if iTunes makes one in that denomination (I have no clue).  Then, the girl's gift card should be like $25 or $30.  Hope this helps!|`|AA10381258	Since its iTunes, I vote for $15 each. A standard CD has 15 songs on it, so an iTunes card for $15 is the equivalent of a CD.|`|ZAhSZlovaa	20..cuz one song is 99c. somtimes he can get 20 songs..etc
ncdTxID9aa	They only had an hour, lol There's a lot to talk about with the 90s. I like the show so far.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You also have to remember for people who are looking for these shows to educate audiences seriously, that it's entertainment.  Vh1, BET, MTV are entertainment, meaning it's not going to be serious all the time.  Oppose to if you watch History Channel, National Geographic or whatever.  So even if you find some significance with these shows based on history, they aren't created to give people knowledge in the since lol but to entertain audiences. And like some of you said, you can always educate yourself.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	Oh, that show that they've been running for the past few years. There's nothing new about "Black to the future".<br>  <br>  edit: Thanks Matrix!! That show was running on VH1 Soul before it was on VH1. It has been running for at least 2 years.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	True but 70's and 80's were better which is disappointing because I wasn't into movies and music until the 1990's.<br>  I thought the show was still "kind of" good.|`|9n4MpLwvaa	I didn't watch or last nights. I breifly watched on Tuesday.<br>  I'm not impressed. But.... Its sorry @ss VH1.|`|HimBbU6caa	VH1 is owned by Viacom, so if Black people watch that and take it as an enlightening representation of Black culture something is wrong. Nothing wrong if you want to watch the show, but it's better to pick up a book.<br>  <br>  Same goes for BET and MTV. It's all garbage pumped to us straight from the cesspool that is Viacom. I'm old enough to remember when BET was relevant. Those days are long gone.<br>  <br>  P.S. Why did Choc get TD's for saying the truth?|`|EufLQ9dKaa	I've never seen the show.  I believe you though.  For some reason I just can't get into VH1.

IPfvar5Waa	I can't tell you who you are but I would say you are bisexual because you enjoy making out and fantasizing about girls. Just because you haven't had sex with a woman it doesn't mean you aren't bisexual. Your attraction to each gender does not need to be equal. Some people go through their entire life without having sex because it's their lifestyle choice, but it doesn't mean they don't have a sexuality. It's about how you feel, not what you do. But you can choose to identify yourself however you want, that's up to you not anyone else.|`|jS6WNDhSaa	I would say that someone who is curious about what it would be like to be with a person of the same sex, but has never acted on their feelings is bi-curious.  Someone who has had some sort of sex with someone of both sexes is bi-sexual.|`|2RWayH3Oaa	Bi- means you are in the middle of the road and likes both sexes.  Bi-curious means you fantasize, daydream,  and imagine yourself with someone of your own sex but have not acted on your fantasy.<br>  Bi-sexual means you have had a relationship with both sexes male and female and you still enjoy dating and being with both sexes.|`|AA11082556	usually the difference is experience or fantasy, so either works you're still bi.|`|5856fa93d8bbf1a2aad2e827f63a50fcaa	You know I find (based on purely my own experiences) that females tend to find themselves in this predicament more often than males. Most gay guys or bi guys I know... well, they've known since they were young kids. A lot of females I know suddenly become open to the idea of being "bi" and ask this same question. If you're bi - you sexually enjoy both men and woman. If your str8, you're sexually all about the pogo stick. Either way, you're you... figure it out or don't... but it's rather simple - be YOU!|`|SsWiDRueaa	Sounds like you're bi curious. You are CURIOUS about the same sex. Don't let it ruin your life, though. Don't cheat on your husband with a girl (or guy).|`|1e90efeeb79c6b4e8fa4f2e5ef94aad5aa	if you never had sex with a girl but fantasize about girls you're just  bi-curious.|`|b49d8eacfd3ce574fd99671e845b3a8eaa	if you havent done it your bcxurious but you probley have a little bisexual down deep in you. good luck
0rDDPTi5aa	I think its too late in history to do it now.  Too many years have gone by, and no one can prove exactly what slave was their ancestor and where they were.  Also, not all blacks were slaves.  Some were free blacks.<br>  <br>  If they were going to do it, it should have been done immediately after the Emancipation Proclamation, given right to the actual slaves.<br>  <br>  What is so amazing to me is that even without reparations, and with laws put in place against them such as the Jim Crow laws, many blacks were still able to be successful, and establish very successful black towns, like Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Rosewood Florida.   Greenwood was so successful they called it the Black Wall Street.  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/cureworks1/bws.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/cureworks1/bws....</a><br>  <br>  Just goes to show you what we can accomplish even with all the odds stacked against us.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	My opinion is that Native Americans, Japanese, and Jewish people have received reparations why not Blacks? Many people might say that those events happened long ago and they do not have anything to do with today. However,  a few years back a forensic accountant did a study where he could trace companies in existence today who have profited from slavery.  Do I need them, no not really, but like I said reparations have been paid out so there is precedent for such a thing.|`|HimBbU6caa	Unthinkable and unnecessary. I'm not a slave and I don't live under Jim Crow laws. Not to mention that the money would come from taxpayers. GM and all of the banks are getting reparations for screwing around their money as well as ours...go figure.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	The way we're in a recession, a reparation would be too extreme. And half the people wouldn't spend the money nice anyway. The day Blacks get reparations, Native americans should also get reparations.|`|kSSlzrufaa	- I wouldn't mind but right now Obama is just spending and throwing around this invisible money that doesn't exist so now's not the time even though if they could find the $$$ for all the bailouts then they could've been gave us our reparations<br>  <br>  - However, black folk don't know how to spend and manage the little chump change they have now; there's no way many could handle hugs sums of money; many would still find themselves stuck in the same predicament they are in now<br>  <br>  - Everyone has gotten their reparations except for us|`|aHlpWFVhaa	I think that i never ever in my life would take some <br>  <br>  charity money because my ancestors were slaves. <br>  <br>  It's not like the money is going to undo the past, besides, <br>  <br>  they'd just say blacks always have their hands out anyway. <br>  <br>  <br>  HELL NO!|`|HPqCRBq8aa	I would rather have reparations, at least that is attempting to right a wrong (even it was a long time ago). Its better than giving these incompetent and crooked Corporations billions and billions, only to see more stupidity.|`|8auEgQf2aa	1 third of white Americans have black slave ancestors meaning most the reparations would go to them then again your saying its based on who is a black American today who can trace back to slavery I dont know if Black Americans of today would gain anything from it.|`|8lNWNxmQaa	They won't help. The damage has already been done. But what gets me is that Native Americans and Japanese have received reparations. Why haven't blacks recieved any?|`|85YtzzKraa	Maybe to the elderly who lived through the Jim Crow laws and the Civil Rights movement but not to our generation!<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't think that we should be given reparations!|`|QidW9DRfaa	I'd rather take an official apology<br>  Money is not the answer for all sins|`|Z3E2zKPWaa	Yes I agree, it is irrelevant to our generation. However, there are families in the south that are still able to trace their origins directly to family members who were slaves. If any reparations were to be given I think it would makes sense to give it to those families. But I have always thought that white people could also get reparations, from their ancestors being slaves. B/C there are white people who have african slaves in their family tree, well for obvious reasons...but that's another question...  <br>  <br>  But other than that, I think the idea of reparations now, is ridiculous. Your right the people who really deserved it are dead and gone. Many black people have no clue about their ancestors, what part of Africa they were from, and etc...If they were given would we invest it wisely. I think it depends on the individual, and how educated they are on investing money.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	I think the fact that this generation lives in America and not back in Africa is a pretty good deal on their part.  <br>  <br>  As for the reparations...I didn't own slaves, why the hell should I pay for them?|`|oYVxMmbQaa	I'm against it. I wasn't enslaved and my parents weren't either. If they do give Blacks money (LOL, it will NEVER happen), it should be people who were affected by Jim Crow.<br>  <br>  But, if I was given money, I'd pay off my college debt and start grad school. A lot of us would invest money in homes, their children's futures, etc. Of course, we'll have the dumb ones who blow their money, but for the most part, I'm pretty optimistic that we'd see the opportunity that comes with the money.
X19YUYsgaa	Why yes.  While it seems unfortunate, sometimes it is a blessing because it is the time where we learn so much.  Don't know why you're asking.  But if its cause its happening to you, take time to look at the good things.  That's actually advice for everyone :)|`|7sqpiGgoaa	only practically..... although i think i have taken 3 steps forward, 4 steps back metaphorically|`|HqgsZw8oaa	yes|`|1lvyUwo7aa	yeah i;ve heard that saying.|`|7h0qfos1aa	You could have just taken one step forward and two steps back, it would have been the same thing :)<br>  <br>  Who hasn't done that?
ixFbNr4taa	Often it is difficult to discuss other pagan religions.  Many other european proto-countries often did not have writing and so their religious rites and traditions were lost.  Of course, often when the Christianity took over - the Church actively suppressed the old religions.  Therefore there is not a lot of information about the early pagan religions for many countries.  <br>  <br>  Would it be.....Gediminas ?|`|175061f78daa0acce0c1ddee4462560caa	there are many pantheon of

I had blond hair and I reached over and doused the flame of the lamp. <br>  <br>  I don't know the year but it was so vivid... It was in the early expansion of the American west.<br>  <br>  I believe that the energy that our bodies produce can go in to the ether and come back again... <br>  <br>  But people that swear they were Napoleon or an "Indian Princess" are just looking for attention.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	Sure, I might have been. I'm currently trying to figure out what exactly my past lives were through the help of a friend who knows this psychic. In fact, he had onced been married to a channel. How interesting it must have been! She told him that in one of his past lives he was a Russian soldier who died in battle. (:<br>  Nothing yet has come to me. Usually when something strikes you as oddly familiar, there's a chance it being related to a past life. I think I may have been a dark witch in a past life. At the very least, it was something evil and seductive. Heh.

The person might actually be White, but of a darker strain like a Greek or Portuguese. The person might be mixed White and Black, White and Indian or all three. The White might be northern European or Mediterranean or both. A few people may have been of other races, such as South Asian (Tzigane, Asian Indian, etc.)."
U2T08abyaa	I was a student in Mississippi in 1964 and we had a daily prayer to Jesus every morning after the pledge. It was prayed thought the intercom and everyone had to bow their head and close their eyes.  I also remember our teacher reading us the bible in First through fifth grade.  After integration in the 1970s, prayer though the intercom and insistance on closing our eyes and bowing our heads was stopped.  I don't know if it was by court law or school choice.<br>  <br>  I thought this was strange as I had come from Alaska and had spent some years in school there and traveled back and forth.  At the time I thought it was very sweet to pray in class and make everyone believe the same as I was being raised Southern Baptist and thought it was right and good that everyone should pray as we did.<br>  <br>  Now, as my world has increased in size and I've met people I love from many different religions, I realize how tremendously unfair that was for people who were not Southern Baptist.  Now I realize how ackward that must have been for the Catholics and nonreligious people.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

1CS2KR7Taa	What you describe is true, but it has happened like this for a reason.<br>  Basically we are nothing else but desires. Our physical form is just a cover for that, but everything we do is driven by desires, if we have no desires any more we die.<br>  And our desires went through an evolution process through human history starting with the basic "animalistic/human" desires of food, sex, shelter, family, then the desires acquired from society like money, power, honor, and finally knowledge.<br>  The problem with desires is that as soon as we get what we wanted, we are fulfilled/satiated, and immediately we start searching for a new one. And our generation has reached the end.<br>  Most of the people, especially in the developed western type world have everything (with all due respect to that part of the world which still struggles for survival, food, and health). We do not know where else to go, what other fulfillment we can search for.<br>  This leads to all kinds of deviations, depression, suicide, drug use, etc.<br>  We just do not know what is the purpose of our lives anymore.<br>  That is what is missing.<br>  We cannot go back on our evolution, we have to go forward.<br>  But now for the first time we have to think, we have to ask questions, we cannot just automatically go on.<br>  So we have to find that purpose we were born for in the first place.<br>  All the best in your search!|`|TfgscKiYaa	I don't know about you, but I like Beethoven, Emily Dickinson's poetry, da Vinci's paintings, and science.<br>  <br>  The reason we have all of those things is because we have figured out ways to survive without having to spend every waking moment growing food or hunting it or preparing to hunt it, as our prehistoric ancestors did.<br>  <br>  The very best that humanity can be was created because we have advanced technologicaly beyond the use of stone knives and bearskins.  Advances in technology are what permitted the kind of thought that goes into 'The Book of Five Rings,' 'The Cloud of Unknowing,' and other great works of philosophy and literature. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, with that sort of advancement, there has to be a trade-off.  We live in infinitely larger communities than our ancestors did, and that causes all manner of social ills, from crime to sheer laziness and complacency.  In a community of 50, no one is anonymous.  In a community of 5 million, most are anonymous.  More leisure time leads to more freedom to engage in our whims.  That added to anonymity leads to bad things, in some cases.  But not always.<br>  <br>  Prehistoric man led a difficult life that lasted only about 30 years.  It was fraught with danger and pain from chronic illnesses, poorly-healed wounds, or reinjury.  If you want to go back and live during the Younger Dryas in hopes of toughening your character, go for it, but I prefer the modern age, even though it is flawed.|`|W7l1awFPaa	You address at least two different issues.  Killing, rape and poverty would not cease to exist under a simpler way of life.  People are people and will do horrible things to others no matter what shape civilization (or the lack of it) takes.<br>  <br>  The government is supposed to be there to regulate society.  If it wasn't we would have to do everything ourselves.  This would include finding food, health care, security and so on.  Personally I am glad that I don't have to take care of everything.<br>  <br>  The problems of society are in the excesses.  Greed particularly springs to mind in today's economic crisis.  Mostly though we are better off than we were hundreds of years ago.  We have come a long way.  I wonder how far we will fall if some major catastrophe strikes?|`|uK3tkaOJaa	No.  The average life expectancy was in the 20s.  The infant mortality rate was off the charts.  Huge populations would starve to death during weather shifts.<br>  <br>  In addition, they lived a primitive existance.  Our thoughts are based in languge.  If we don't speak, we can't have complex thoughts.  We'd just live primitive, unenlightened, short lives.|`|DZ9ADg7Xaa	Okay, I did not read all that. I'm going to answer the question I clicked on.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I do think so. People often envy those who have lots of matieral possessions. I envy people who live in small African tribes in forests. They don't continuously grasp for a future that, once it becomes the present, they will ignore. They live day by day. They live by instinct. Back before civilization, I'm guessing people were more tribal in these ways. American society is so impersonal and people walk past each other and more often than not see not people, but blurs. (Well, in big cities like mine.) Tribes are more personal.|`|AA10556726	Try investigating what bones and other remains we have of early humans.

97d2a2d9ef8fc8e73e2d9c8436cd4609aa	The answer is a bit complex.  <br>  The rate of spread of Christianity in the Americas has slowed considerably compared to the spread of other religions, but that is a little misleading.  For example if you have 100 people, 80 are Christians and 10 are Muslim and 10 are Agnostic.  If 5 Agnostics convert to Christianity and 3 Agnostics convert to Islam, then Islam has grown by 30% whereas Christianity only grew by 6% even though more people became Christians than Muslims.  <br>  So even though Christianity is converting more people, the rate of growth is slower than that of Islam.<br>  In Western Europe, Christianity may even be losing ground altogether, but in Eastern Europe (particularly in the former Soviet States)  Christianity is like a wildfire spreading fast.  It is the same in India, China and SE Asia.  So it all depends on where you look and how you look at the numbers.<br>  Overall, world wide, Christianity is doing just fine. It is just that in some of its traditional strongholds, the people have gotten a little apathetic and slothful.|`|0lnamekJaa	Yes... But unfortunately it is being replaced with radical Islam...<br>  <br>  I would take a closed minded yet ball-less christian over a suicide bomber any day!<br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br>  THE PROBLEMS WITH ISLAM consists of selected articles, mainly from ex-Muslim authors who have written against the violence, corruption, and tyrannical nature of Islam. Many of these essays come from islam-watch.org which dedicates itself to the scrutiny of Islam. Considering the Fatwas against those who criticize Islam (which could eventually result in their censorship or death), it takes special courage and dedication for these authors to risk revealing the actual nature of Islam to the world.<br>  <br>  I would especially like to thank Meher Ali Khan for convincing me that I should add an Islamic section to NoBeliefs.com. Although these articles will, no doubt, result in 'preaching to the choir' to fundamentalist Christians who, by their very nature, oppose other religions, it should serve as a reminder that Islam has a similar Old Testament structure as Christianity. Although we do not have Fatwas in the United States, our thanks to that does not come from religion, but solely because we have a secular Constitution that guarantees freedom of expression and no religious tests. Without this thin constitutional protection, America could very well fall into medieval religious fundamentalism, just as many Islamic countries experience today. Indeed, many of our political and religious leaders today work to dismantle the separation of church and state. Thus these articles should serve as a warning of what could very well happen and, indeed, has begun to happen, in America.

The controversial debate about the clash of civilizations between Islam and the West took a spectacular turn on the fateful day of 9/11. Regardless of how one views the controversy, the bottom-line reveals that there exists a serious fault-line between Islamic and the Western societal system and way of life. The core reason sits with the belief in the Koran, a manual of intimidation, vengeance, violence, terror and war, instead of peace, tranquility, harmony and justice towards non-Muslims. <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br>  <a href="http://www.islamreview.com/articles/islamicheaven.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreview.com/articles/isla...</a><br>  Islamic Heaven by Syed Kamran Mirza.

But if one peeks behind the veil of this Islamic ban, one can see Islam for what it really represents: an obscurantist and a violent religion which promotes cruelty, armed militancy, human rights violation and a hindrance to progress and modernization. <br>  <br>  ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ <br>  <a href="http://www.islam-watch.org/AlamgirHussain/unfettered_religious_freedom.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-watch.org/AlamgirHussai...</a><br>  Unfettered Religious Freedom in Islam: A Fact or Fiction? by Alamgir Hussain.

I thought the bible taught that salvation was a narrow road that only few would take anyway?<br>  <br>  I thought islam and christianity was about saving souls, not fighting over who is going to be the ruler to control and enslave souls...You make it sound like their two different politcal factions seeking to figure out who is going to be the one to govern the world.Both bible and koran are highly anthropomorphic so they can't accomodate everyone, though  they do morph into a similar anthropomorphic books that create just another tribal blind loyalty.Democracy and freedom of religion protects everyone despite which religion gets the popular vote, everyone wants to believe in something diferent, there can never be a one world religion, its nuts if you think that is going to happen, the idea goes against all of human cultural and social nature.The only reason christianity would be declining is because the book was designed for the 1st century, even if islam did replace christianity it will lose its 15 minutes of fame also. Cultures evolve, the only way cultures survive, as christianity has done slightly is to change through some form of reformation, might need to rewrite yet another bible to the 3000+ different christian bibles in existence in order for christianity to survive, though I am not sure how that will go over.. The christianity today is not the christianity it was 1000 years ago, or the christianity it was 1000 years before that. THere were changes at council of nicea, the protestant reformation that began in europe, and many other events I can't name here. Christianity could still exist well into the future, I've been hearing about the Progressive christianity movement, that is trying to keep the bible relevent to modern times by eleminating the barbaric concepts that is often found in the bible, and irrelevent concepts that only pertained to the 1st century era.I grewup mostly with protestant background and some catholic. Catholics where I am from usually seem more adaptable to change..Many people are not leaving christianity for islam, they are leaving christianity to declare their independence from the stone age.....<br>  <br>  And, yes it could be a demographic thing, choosing a religion, or changing religions can also be like are you going to buy from Nike, Old Navy, or some other company, are you going to Christian, Islamic, Buddhist, or....Alot of religious leaders treat their faith like that, they have a business office, marketing team, usually hundreds sometimes thousands of salesman (aka believers), to sell their books and beliefs,usually with political agendas thrown in for good measure....It shouldn't have anything to do with politics, seperation of church and state protects all religions....|`|HjPxEupWaa	Christianity is definitely declining...but Catholicism? nope<br>  <br>   People are more educated and less gullible so less people fall for the atheism myth.<br>  <br>  It's certainly gaining popularity."

Xsen794Aaa	If you don't know any Italian at all or only know some phrases but can't put together your own sentences, Rosetta is the best thing out there.<br>  <br>  Take it from me, I've spent over $3000 on different books, programs and CDs to learn languages over the years and the only thing that worked was Rosetta.<br>  <br>  I used it for French for about a month and then I took the placement test at my university and I got to skip the first year of French (two classes, which would have cost $15,000+ the extra time going to class for a year).  I took the second-year class last semester, I easily got an A despite I'm not a studier, everyone said they liked the way I spoke French the best, I got the second-highest grade in the class and I'd never taken French before Rosetta Stone.<br>  <br>  It's definitely the fastest way.  You might want to get an Italian-English dictionary too for when you don't know a word, and if you really need explanations for things, check out "Italian Demystified" which explains the grammar nicely.  "Easy Italian Reader" is also a good book if you want to feel like you really know Italian, but you have to know quite a bit before you can use it, so use Rosetta first and you can read the Reader on the plane to Italy.<br>  <br>  Read the Wikipedia article on Italian first to get a general sense of what to expect.  Also check out LiveMocha.com, which is a free website with a program very similar to Rosetta Stone, but with much less content.  Look for Italian-language podcasts on ITunes, they're free and some can be really helpful.|`|C4cVH7g8aa	The fastest way possible would be to move to a country that speaks Italian, so that you are completely surrounded by the Italian language, culture, and people. This would also force you to use Italian in your everyday life, and you would learn faster.<br>  <br>  If that is not an option, then you should take classes with an instructor who is a native speaker. I'd advise not to use any of those online classes or anything, because you wouldn't be able to ask the instructor specific questions if you had any. I do know that some places offer "fast-track" courses, which compacts the course into a shorter amount of time for those planning on travelling to a country in a couple months that speaks the language. What you'll have to do is research on the internet or in your community for local Italian classes.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|4RbmaE2aaa	Take some courses at a community college if there's enough time.

If there were a chance it would bring negative attention to you, I'm sure she wouldn't want that. And you don't want disrespect for your grandmother's tiara.  <br>  <br>  Prom is so special. We dream about it, plan for it. You've had a gown made especially for the occasion. You've got a very special date. You're going to look and feel like royalty. Do you really need the tiara?  <br>  <br>  An option may be to wear the tiara in a couple of your prom pictures, if your boyfriend likes the idea.<br>  <br>  I hope you have many happy memories of your proms.<br>  Take care and have fun!|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Of course its OK every girl is a princess and deserves to feel like one at least once in their life and you should wear what you want to your prom.<br>  By the way I like your avatar.|`|AA12152549	It would be fine; but make sure that it is held securely in place.

Otherwise you would just look silly, like a wannabe.
mVTGl6HGaa	In English, the superlative and the comparative are created by inflecting adjectives or adverbs. The structure of a superlative consists normally of the positive stem of the adjective or adverb, plus the suffix -est, or (especially in words of a Latin or Romance origin) the modifier "most" or "least" before the adjective or adverb. It always has the definite article and is completed by "of" or other preposition plus one or more nouns of entities that it surpasses to the highest or greatest degree, such as in "he is the tallest of/in the class," or "the town is the most beautiful in the country."<br>  <br>  Mention should be made also of the elative, which is not an actual separate inflection but the intensified degree of adverbs and adjectives. Adjectives at the elative do not refer to other objects, like a superlative does; e.g., "she is very beautiful"; "she is most beautiful" (intensification in this case means "very beautiful indeed"). Simply put; the word 'superlative' is defined as:<br>  <br>      * (as a noun) an exaggerated mode of expression (usually of praise); "the critics lavished superlatives on it"<br>      * (as an adjective) the greatest: the highest in quality<br>      * the superlative form of an adjective; "best" is the superlative form of "good", "most" when used together with an adjective or adverb.
