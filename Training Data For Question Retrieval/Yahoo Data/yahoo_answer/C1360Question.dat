20090203120945AAeeEjP	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	When are men going to get the 'equal' rights that women do?	Start paying for dates.      - Fight to have rape and domestic abuse laws require actual proof beyond a woman's word, no matter how much crying and sobbing she does.       - Have women stop their bullshit mind games used to manipulate men.      - Stop whining and crying about "sexist" jokes and remarks when women say similar things all the time about men.      - Drop your pre-conceived notions that the world has it out for women. Accept responsibility for yourselves.      - Drop your pre-conceived notions that men are sex-maddened pigs who only want one thing.      - Stop thinking that men have no emotions.      - Stop hitting men if you don't want to be hit back.      - Protest when a woman is given a lesser punishment than a man for the same crime. Happens A LOT.      - Stop assuming that a man who is nice to kids is a pervert.      - Stop affirmative action. This is favoritism and discrimination plain and simple. Where is affirmative action in the female-dominated industries, hmm? No need for equality there I suppose.      - Stop publishing hate-speech about men (alot of feminist literature) while censoring men who say the same.       - Let a man stay home and be the housekeeper/childrearer or whatever term you want to apply to that role, and let the woman be the breadwinner. Also, stop chastising men who want to do so.      - Finally, stop playing the sexism card when you don't get that job you applied for.

20090203122442AAhR1WD	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Do you think people have been socially conditioned to find RAPE more repulsive than it really is ?	just for the sake of a rational discussion..      do you think the way a victim of rape reacts ie being scarred for life, psychologically etc is a result of 1000's of years of social conditioning rather than NATURAL response.?      i think society over the centuries have made women react so much to rape.      ..associating morality with virginity    ..men rejecting women who slept elsewhere   ..women being labelled as slut for sleeping around   ..the risk of getting pregnant from the rapist   ..society becoming over-protective of a woman who is raped   ..stigmatizing a rape victim   ..images and stories of women who commit suicide after being raped constantly thrust into girls minds.      do you think all these factors conditioned women to respond to rape in way that nature otherwise probably didnt meant.       OR do you think a rape victims response is natural and built in by nature

20090203122957AAvDaoy	Social Science;Psychology	Can Cabin Fever bring about insanity?	I read this story in a magazine that was about this group of people who were trapped in Mountain Lodge for a couple of months and three of them went insane One man ran outside and got lost in a blizzard & died from exposure, while another killed someone and one killed himself while everyone else was screaming at each other. These people weren't just a little irritable they hated each other.  I thought this was a little over the top but my friend says this can really happen if people get trapped together. Is this true?
20090203122853AA78Z1A	Social Science;Psychology	How Dark Ambient music affects psychic and mind?	Assuming they mostly use cosmic noise signals... And make music out of it you know, and quite of depressive kind, on the first sight. But it does the trick, I found it very effective for some meditations. It may increase level of consciousness, can make free of fuss. And although you can be still depressed, you start to see the answers for the questions you beared for quite a while deep inside. Well thats my story, it differs from person to person.   But still I want to know the trick! How can it work? Scientifically, psychologically or astrologically, I will consider all ways, describing the supernatural effects and nature of this kind of music.    And who else notices artificial effects, would be also welcomed to discuss.
20090222200845AA8uTzQ	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I so paranoid?	My sister's husband is pretty much the coolest guy ever. He's friendly to pretty much everyone, and whenever I visit them (which is like, once a year, lol) he always seems like he enjoys my company. but every time, I get this feeling that I'm just not cool enough to talk to him. I feel like he always sees something negative in me...maybe I'm a quiet dork who just sits in a corner, while he's the outgoing jock type of guy.    but he certainly doesn't act like he dislikes me...he actually seems to care about everything I do, and seems kinda overprotective at times. Not that it's a horribly bad thing.      I still feel like he's way too amazing to be related to me, or to even want to talk to me. Every little thing he does that seems like he's doesn't want to talk to me, I take it way overboard and think that he hates me. I hate that feeling. I think it could be because I'm a teenager and he's in his late twenties. I don't know, what do you think?

20090222203854AA62S73	Social Science;Psychology	Is this solipsism? if not, what are my theories about life?	i have come up with 6 theories about life (i know i sound like a total weirdo, but i can't control it):      1. nothing exists. everything is fake. you, your dog, your uncle, and me. you might ask "if everything is fake, then how are you here right now?" but the answer to that: i don't know. it's just a theory that maybe nothing is real.   2. i'm the only real thing in the world and you are all in my imagination. when things don't go my way, i say to myself "why me?", well maybe it's because my imagination is making it this way. how can i tell you're real? i don't know, therefore you probably aren't real.   3. the purpose of life is to die. we all end up dying anyways, the question is when does it happen, and how do you die. but why are we here if we'll all end up dying? it's because this life is not important, it's the afterlife that matters, and you have to go through this life to get there.   4. it's all a dream. i'm actually dreaming right now. i might be some 40 year old guy living in my mom's basement, dreaming of another person and what his life would be. and i can't wake up from this dream. it seems so real, but it's a dream.   5. this sounds absolutely absurd, but here goes: everyone is a monster (other than me), and they are dressing up as humans in order to trick me into loving or hating them, only to realize they are all going to kill me.   6. God put me on this earth as a test - a test to see how humans would interact with other humans. no one is real, not even me. God just put me here to see if his idea of humans would work. if he believes it's working, then he might make more. if not, he won't.      PLEASE HELP ME, I'M INSANE

20090222203632AAw89Wi	Social Science;Psychology	How do you feel about adults treating another adult like a child & trying to control his/her life?	I'm 25 with a college degree, & people constantly try to order me around, control me, intrude in my personal business & personal life, & they try to physically stop me from doing something that would make me satisfied. Simple. All I have to do is buy Ozarka Spring Water @ WalMart, & they would tell me, "No, don't get that. Get this Sam's Choice water!" & if I proceed to get the Ozarka water, they'd try to break my wrists from trying to get it.      This is usually family, so-called friends/associates, or whoever knows me. If I go somewhere, 1 of my neighbors would DEMAND an answer for where I'm going, & I can't even go to the library without them saying I'm making a dangerous decision. I take the bus.      I wonder how I can get people off my back from doing these things to me. Even if they're family, they tell me they don't give a damn about me. Well, why do they act like they're so concerned about my life? They never tell me where they're going. They'd tell me it's none of my damn business.      I suffer OCD, anxiety, Tourette's, & depression, & they don't understand nor care to understand. All they want to do is label me as crazy, just because I'm different, they never believe a word I say, they DEMAND an answer for my personal business & use fake psychology, manipulation, & threats to get me to comply with what THEY want me to do. People agree with their teenage kids bossing me around, & they come RIGHT behind the child & do what the child commanded me to do. This is even in the family.      No one believes anything I say, they stereotype me as "crazy", schizophrenic, delusional, psychotic, & dangerous, & they think it's THEIR duty to keep a close watch on me & monitor me. I have my own apartment, & they come knocking on my door, nagging me. They so-claim that they don't want other people using & taking advantage of me, but they do it to me themselves.       I feel I only have 2 friends who are very understanding & don't treat me like this, & they tell others to back off, if they're present.      People think they can make my life decisions FOR me. They want to DEMAND an answer for why I want to get a job, & why I want to get married & have kids, & they think I don't have the mentality to take care of a child. & they tell me that if I get pregnant, they're gonna make arrangements to have my baby taken away before it's born.      I'm tired of so many altercations, & I'm tired of them using violence against me. I'm tired of the cops getting involved & taking their side when I simply VERBALLY defend myself. The cops don't even believe me because of the label as CRAZY.       I think I mentioned already that people don't believe I have a college degree. So, I stay home & hide away from everyone. My social anxiety symptoms give me panic attacks, & people see the symptoms of my mental disorders as trying to seek attention, when I'm not. They're ignorant.

I've been a dancer for 6 years and when I try out for the school dance team, I was the first one cut.   I tried to learn how to do magic tricks and when I did my first Performance the whole magic trick fell off the table and I was booed off the stage.   I went out for singing at my school. My teacher lied to me and told me I was a good singer. She made me sing at a basketball game and the next day, I was the laughing stock of the school   I'm pretty much failing all of my classes..   My parents are mad at me for staying up late at night when I'm trying to write something.   My friends don't give a crap   I started video production. I made my first trailer and I found out now that all of my friends hate it...      I can go on and on... but everything I try fails...I applied for TV Pro. and Bio Tech classes at school, but I'm probably just going to fail out of them....      The school is starting dance team tryouts again.. I don't think I should try out because I'll just probably get kicked out again.      What should I do to try to get my life back on track?
20090222201541AA6dnvg	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does this dream mean?	Ok so i had this dream. It was extremely vivid. It was about this group of very peter-pan's-lost-boyesc people ( i believe they were fairies) any way they would just kind of hang out in the forest and perform whatever they felt like. Skits, songs, monlogues, plays, whatever. This one little boy who was about 4 and a very good actor decided to leave the group to become a banker. He got older and accidently stumbled upon the group again. They asked him to hang out and put on a performance. He said he was kind of rusty and that he would rather just kind of tag along in someone else's performance. One boy named John voluntered to have the other boy mimic his performance in his one man dance-thing called "I Am John" which i remember thinking was very funny. John was really conceded and he put on this strange monologue interpretive dance thing that started with "I...Am...John" and then he danced and explained how he was the best dancer actor and fighter in the land. The other boy just kind of stumbled through it. And the leader of this group ( who was a woman) asked the one boy to do the " to die would be an awfully great adventure" scene from peter pan before he left because she used to love his performance of it. Oh and when they weren't acting or whatever they would play pranks on people.

20090222212828AAv4oEC	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Are pedophiles treated unfairly?	I asked this question a while ago in a different category and received some interesting responses. I'd like to see what this GWS has to offer.      Now, let me define pedophile for this question: someone who is innately attracted to children. Always felt that way their whole lives, never had a choice. I'm talking about  someone who experiences the feelings, NOT someone who has or actively seeks to abuse children; someone who sees these feelings as wrong and actively refrains from acting on them.      Are they ridiculed unfairly by society? Would you feel sympathetic for such a person?      It seems that in today's society if a pedophile like this were to come out and seek help for his feelings, he would still face a great deal of ridicule. You can be sure if it was made public every parent in the neighborhood would be telling their children to avoid this person. They too, would probably eliminate or minimize their own contact with this person.      If this person did decide to seek help, treatments are limited and generally ineffective. This could partly be due to the fact that society is quick to criminalize the orientation and sees it as something that needs to be contained, and not treated.      Is it fair that his person will never be able to experience a sexual relationship because of, for the sake of this question, how they were born? Should we as a society do more to treat pedophiles instead of contain them?      Bit of a taboo question I'm sure, but let me hear your thoughts.

20090222204744AAnYCdJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I had this dream over a year ago and it still bothers me. What does it mean?	Ok so in my dream i lived with my elderly father and my younger sister and our crazy mother. We lived in a shack on a farm and we were very poor and my sister and i were very unhappy because our mother was extremely mean to us. Anyway eventually oneday i realised that my mother was on edge a little more than usual and realized she had a shot gun so i tried to sneak my sister and I out of the house and go find our father who was away at our neighbors (which was miles away). She realized i was trying to sneak away and she shot us both. Then i woke up (still in the dream) and it was the same day and i tried over an over again to prevent the shooting and no matter what i did i couldn't stop it. Once i got outside and my father was coming home and i said "Daddy help!" and then my mother shot him then me. It just went on and on. Another wierd thing is that i am the youngest in my family in real life and i have no younger sister. Also my father is younger than my mother in real life, and we live in a house.

20090222211739AA4yvZn	Social Science;Psychology	Do I possess precognitive skills?	Ever since I was little, I have been, what I've suspected, extra-sensitive to the supernatural. I can automatically tell if a house is the home to spirits or if it's empty. There are little things like being able to predict the next song on the radio or what someones name is before they tell me. I also can guess what someone is thinking but this is subconscious... I never realize that they are thinking the same thing until I say it out loud and they tell me.    A lot of these things freak me out when they happen and I don't tell anyone because I don't want to scare anybody but I would really like to explore this part of me if it's what I've suspected. I grew up in a haunted house (which we had exorcised because it became unbearable) but I was the only one who could feel and see the spirits. How do I figure out more?
