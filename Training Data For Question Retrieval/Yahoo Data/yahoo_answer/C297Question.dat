I don't remember much about this drama since I watched it when I was a kid, but it showed on "fairchild" channel between 1999-2003 (I think).  It was about this teenager looks about 20 or so solving mysteries and almsot every episode was a different mystery.  One of the mysteries he solved had to do with swinging from door to door, so the criminal didn't leave footprints.  And one of the last episodes he was stuck on an island with a group of soldiers and they were getting killed one by one.  He usually travels with a girl, and when he solves a mystery he always says "I have solved this mystery" in cantonese, l can't write chinese, but ill try "這個秘我解开" its something like that. I think I think the drama may have been dubbed to Cantonese.  If anyone had any ideas please post.

A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do. "Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?"      The blonde said, "How about 50 dollars?"      The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, "Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?"      The man replied, "She should. She was standing on the porch."      A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.      "You're finished already?" he asked.      "Yes," the blonde answered, "and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats."      Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50.      "And by the way," the blonde added, "That's not a Porsche, it's a Ferrari."

I've had writer's block for a REALLY long time though. When I was writing poetry I was really depressed and upset so I had a lot of passion going into the poems. Now that I'm over it I can't find enough emotion to write anything good. I feel so drained of feelings, it sucks. How can I find it in me to write again? I can only write bits and pieces and fragments of words, but never enough for a whole poem or song. =(
20090225065916AAUQnmh	Entertainment & Music;Television;Soap Operas	Y&R Do you think Jill and Gloria are fruit cakes?	OK. I guess Gloria was trying to win an Emmy with that fake cry of hers to her son Michael. I didn't feel anything with that one. I don't see how Michael was able to sit across from her without laughing in her face. I mean she acted as though he had on a priest collar and she had to confess all her sins after that delusional dream she had of getting her face smashed in by all those inmates. And Jill? OMG. She had the gall to call Chloe a gold digger? I wanted to put a bat signal up in the sky when she said that! Are you serious? Gold digger is Jill's middle name for goodness sake. And then talking about Esther then jumping into bed with Gloria's ex. Eew! Wouldn't you just like to choke both of them with a sock until their eyes pop out? Now that's good writing.

20090203160856AAiKoUR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	Uh Oh Uh Oh Uhuhuhuhuhuhuhu oh!!!  Techno Song and its buggin the heck outta me... Please Help!!!?	OK...In the beginning of the song, they play the beat with chimes/bells (xylophone sorta) and it goes (Sorry) ding dingding dingdingding dingding dingdingding dingding ding-ding-ding-ding and they play that a few times over...  Then later in the song it sounds like a mob of people sayin Uh-Oh Uh-Oh Uhuhuhuhuhuhuhuh Uh-Oh!!!  This is an awsome song and its played in a lot of 18+ clubs and gets everybody to jump up and sing along with it!!!   Also...And im praying this doesn't confuse someone who might have the answer... but the song "Reason by Cascada" reminds me of "the anonymous song" especially when the beat starts to loop over.  Again its a TECHNO SONG, and it's not "Zombie Nation by Kernkraft 400".  Again any help would be a godsend.      Thanks!

20090304182327AAli9uj	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why does my best friend always make fun of my music?	We're 15 and have been best friends for about eight years. Almost everytime we're listening to my ipod, she picks the song herself, but whenever she's busy she asks me to choose one. Today we were  listening to "Banana Pancakes" by Jack Johnson and she told me to change it quick because she can't handle "crap like that".  I ask her what she'd like to listen to and she always says "anything better than that".. She does this to me just about every time we listen to music and I've tried every genre. If I say I heard this song from someone who's considered "popular" she'll always say she loves it.. but if I say I heard it, she gives it about ten seconds and tells me to turn that crap off. It really makes me mad and I never want to listen to music when I'm with her, why do you think she does this?

I used to love the song and now i can't remember it.    It is sang by a man or a male group. The song is about a girl, probably a long lost and in the song it's like he went back to the place where he grew up and was singing about it. The chorus of the song is about the girl and a photo he had a photo on a wall.    Ten points to the first right answer that i get. Thanks for your help.

20090225071219AADfQkV	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Do you think Slumdog Millionaire deserved 8 oscars?	it is a good film, but that's about it, it is a movie made by the western perspective of india, depicting (quite accurately) its slums and 'slumdogs', so it is not exactly a very flattering picture of india,   although the movie shows slum life quite realistically, it also has been heavily criticised for peddling 'poverty porn' to the west, that is, showing the west a picture of india as they would like it, not necessarily completely true,   it is not that i criticize the film because it shows india in a poor light, but rather because it seems to depend mainly on this 'slum'  factor for its success       however, the other aspects like romance, acting, screenplay, cinematography, music, etc, are quite good,   i'm not saying the movie shows something unrealistic, but there are many other great and beautiful things about india, but they had to go and make a movie on our slums   the first time india is in the global spotlight in the field of entertainment and they had to show our slums      way to go

We   don't live where we did when you left home. Your dad read in the newspaper that most accidents happen within 20 miles from your home, so we moved.

This place is really nice. It even has a washing machine. I'm not sure it works so well though; last week I put a loan in and pulled the chain and haven't seen them since. The weather isn't bad here. It only rained twice last week; the first time for three days and the second time for four days.      About that coat you wanted me to send you, your Uncle Stanley said it would be to heavy to send in the mail with the buttons on, so we cut them off and put them in the pockets.      John locked his keys in the car yesterday. We were really worried because it took him two hours to get me and your father out.      Your sister had a baby this morning; but I haven't found out what it is yet so I don't know if you are an aunt or an uncle. The baby looks just like your brother.      Uncle Ted fell in a whiskey vat last week. Some men tried to pull him out, but he fought them off playfully and drowned. We had him cremated and he burned for three days.

As the cashier runs your purchase over the scanner, look mesmerized and say, "Wow, magic!"       Ask other customers if they have any Grey Poupon.       Attempt to fit others into very large gym bags.       Challenge other customers to duels with tubes of gift-wrap.       Contaminate the entire auto department by sampling all the spray air fresheners.       Dart around suspiciously while humming the theme from Mission Impossible.       Drag a lounge chair over to the magazines and relax.       Go to the food court, buy a drink, and ask if they can put a little umbrella in it.       Drape a blanket around your shoulders and run around saying, "I'm Batman. Come Robin, to the Batcave."       Follow people through the aisles, staying about 5 feet behind them. Do this until they leave the store.       Get 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in people's carts when they aren't looking.      Go into a fitting room, shut the door and wait a while and then yell loudly "There's no toilet paper in here!"       Go to the Service Desk and ask to put a bag of M&M's on lay away.      Hide in a clothing rack and when people browse through, say "PICK ME! PICK ME!"      Hold indoor shopping cart races.       In the auto department, practice your "Madonna look" using different size funnels.      Leave Cheerios in lawn and garden, pillows in the pet section, etc.       Look right into the security camera, use it as a mirror and pick your nose.

Re-dress the mannequins as you see fit.       Relax in the patio furniture until you get kicked out.       Ride a display bicycle through the store; claim you are taking it for a test drive.       Ride those little electronic cars at the front of the store.       Say things like, "Would you be so kind as to direct me to your Twinkies."       Set all the alarm clocks to go off at ten-minute intervals throughout the day.       Set up a "Valet Parking" sign in front of the store.       Set up a tent in the camping department and tell other shoppers you'll invite them in if they bring pillows from the bed department.      Start playing Calvinball; see how many people you can get to join.       Take bets on the battle from above.       Take off your shoes and tell them you want to return it and when they say you didn't buy it there say, "Hm... I thought the customer was always right!"       Take shopping carts for the express purpose of filling them and stranding them at strategic locations.       Take up an entire aisle in toys by setting up a full-scale battle with G.I. Joe vs. X-men.       Test the brushes and combs in cosmetics.       Test the fishing rods and see what you can catch from other aisles.       TP as much of the store as possible before they stop you.       Try to hold up customers with the toy guns. See how much you can make.      Tune all the radios to polka stations; then turn them off and turn the volume up to full blast.       Walk up to an employee and tell him/her in an official tone, 'Code 3' in Housewares and see what happens.      Walk up to complete strangers and say, "Hi. I haven't seen you in so long." etc. See if they play along.       When 2 or 3 people are walking ahead of you, run between them yelling "Red Rover."       When a clerk asks if they can help you, begin to cry and ask, "Why can't you people just leave me alone?"      When an announcement comes over the loud speaker, assume the fetal position and scream "NO! NO! It's those voices again!!!"      When someone steps away from his or her cart to look at something, quickly make off with it without saying a word.       When there are people behind you, walk really slowly, especially in thin aisles.       While handling guns in the hunting department, ask the clerk if he knows where the anti-depressants are.      While walking through the clothing department, ask yourself loud enough for all to hear, "Who buys this crap anyway?!"

20090225071139AABtKyB	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What's your review on BATMAN 1989?	What I feel about Batman '89 is something you can't put into words. It was the first SERIOUS attempt at Batman the world had ever seen on the big screen. When people saw it, it was unlike anything they've EVER seen before. The movie was done so carefully and brilliantly, the visuals and everything was just the icing on the cake. The frightning, dirty, and gothic tone was just so PERFECT, because the combination of the three had never been done before with a Batman movie. The gritty and darkish mood and vibe was just a wonderful feeling people got when they saw the movie. In fact, it was such a feeling, NO BATMAN MOVIE WILL EVER BE ABLE TO REPLICATE.

I was watching Kirk's Lean on Me music video and was completely perplexed by the smooth transformations.

I didn't ask who is your favorite, I said who is better. Don't just put down the artist. If you truly think one is better than the other give a good legit answer on why one is better than the other.      I cast my vote to Lupe Fiasco, for he is lyrically insane and 10x more skilled than Lil Wayne. He takes a song and liek completely destroys it with is lyrical word play. It actually makes sense and ACTUALLY means someting. I don't think Lil Wayne is talented at all. Maybe style, sometimes, but it's not how his music sounds, it's the mssg he sends out to the people who listen. The Cool vs The Carter III, The Cool most definantly deserves that title, for best rap album of the year.      o(^_-)v

I love anime but the problem is I am very picky about what I will watch.Any anime I watch has to have a HAPPY ENDING. No open ended stuff for me please. Also I hate it when there is an anime where a guy has to choose between two girls or a girl has to choose between 2 guys and that is the main plot. If it is going to be a love story please no girl in love with 2 guys what ever will she do.I like Action, adventure, romance, and comedy. One more thing I can't read things that would be under the mature category. Like I said I'm picky and thanks to everyone who answers.

20090304194650AAxr0l8	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Taurus: Do you try to figure people out?	I've befriended a Taurus girl recently, since she is the one that took care of me when I was plastered and crying. Well, she also is the good friend of my ex's recent ex girlfriend. So, I thought things would be awkward, but she's actually the one that initiates conversation and constantly wants to hang out. So, it's really not bad, but I'm still keeping my walls up.      Well she's been talking about what her plans are tonight and asked me mine. Just now she mentioned that my ex is going to pick her up and they're going to drink. I think she's trying to get a feel for my response, and I'm not sure why. I didn't know that she knew that he was my ex, but it's too much of a coincidence that she would mention that to me.       My gut is telling me that's she's trying to figure me out or something. I'm not quite sure. Is that common with Tauruses?      (Obviously you can't generalize, but I mean... generally, anyway.)

20090304190448AA8c0hg	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	My Tribute Video.............?	Hey R&P...I posted this last night unofficially to get a few responses and so far so good.         This is a tribute video I made for Sam The Koala. I did it in the hopes that someone might see it and maybe help out a little with a donation, or if they are in Australia, maybe volunteer their time.         Heres the funny thing. I originally tried to post it on youtube but because the song I used was from a Warner Brothers recording artist, they muted the sound so I took it to Metacafe. Cool thing about them is that for every 2000 views they pay $2. I instructed them that all moneys made on this video go to the RSPCA in Victoria.      Anyway I hope you like it. Even if you dont just remember it's for a good cause and your click helps =)       http://www.metacafe.com/watch/2515176/sa...

I just heard on the news about a girl in Miami FL who had went in for an abortion and was given the drugs. She sat in the waiting room so long that she had her baby on the chair. Then the doctor came in and knocked the baby on the floor, picked it up and put in a bio hazard waste bag and threw it away. That baby deserves a proper burial. I hope this opens up a lot of people's eyes on what the doctors think about the babies they are killing.

20090304202106AAQij6b	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	POLL: Roommate/Internet question?	Okay, I have had this roommate in college for about two months now (the other one moved out, transferred to a different school) and when she first moved in, I offered to share my internet connection with her if she payed for half of it. She said she'd ask her mom about it. I never heard her mention it again. Then tonight, I was in the room alone and happened to glance at her computer and it said she was connected to the internet! The ***** was connected to MY internet without asking or paying (I knew it was my internet because all the other local internet connections in nearby apartments are secured by password, and so is mine, but she has access to the router)! I checked to make sure it was my internet connection, and sure enough it was! So, I called Verizon and got them to help me change the password. So, my question is, will she be able to access the internet now that I changed the password? Also, should I confront her about using my internet without permission/paying?

The only exception I make is Blink-182 because they got me starting to play music but that's it I listen to old skool music. I don't know if it's because of the production value since everybody basically records uses computers instead of tape and they all lypsinc. I know they are some good artists out there but they are not well known in the mainstream. New hip hop sucks *** and rock or metal is just pure noise. Old hip hop was cool and they spoke about real stuff not going to the club and having jewelery and old rock, whether it was rock and roll, blues rock, metal, or punk, etc. was inspirational. Let me know what you think.

Finally, at lunch break, they confronted one another. One man, obviously stronger, said “See that wheelbarrow? I’m willing to bet $100 that anything you can wheel to that cone and back, I can wheel twice as far. Do we have a bet?” The other man, too dignified to decline, shook his hand. He looked at the objects lying around: a pile of 400 bricks, a steel beam, the 10 men that had gathered around to watch, and a stack of ten bags of concrete mix. “All right,” he said, and revealed his object. That night, the bigger man went home angrier and $100 poorer. What was the smaller man’s object?

Try as I might, I have not been able to build it up & now she is depressed because she can not find a boyfriend. She is a nice girl, but to be frank, her low self esteem shows in how she presents herself to others. Normally, she is a plain Jane, but when we go out, one would assume that she'd dress up a bit, but no. Everyone knows that as shallow as it might be, your looks are what people see 1st & you are judged by them. How can I help her gain the ability to love herself      I tried asking this question in the "Family & Relationship" section under "friends" But it has been a 1/2 hour and no answers, so I have decided to move it to P/S .. ... ...

I told her that I liked her by saying something along the lines of "I hope this doesn't make our friendship weird but I like you as more than a friend" she said "its not weird just unexpected" and after that it was just small talk about how we both sucked at rubix cubes and solitaire and how I could probably be good at spider solitaire because it was easy and the weather.      she never said how she felt or anything and i can't figure out if that was because she didn't want to hurt my feelings or what.      should i ask her how she feels about me or would that make me look desperate?

20071111204952AA71iJx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	No creen que el Rock paro el tiempo?	Haciendo un estudio de los géneros que lograron llegar a gran parte del mundo, me encontré que de todos estos ritmos el único que todavía suena tanto desde los sesentas hasta la fecha presente es el Rock Pop. ya sea en Ingles como en Espa?ol      Ritmos como el swin, manbo,tango,y y boleros hoy en dia cuando se escucha alguno parece que fuera de principios de siglo de lo rara vez que lo ponen. sin embargo el rock aunque sea de los sesentas parece que lo grabaron ayer.,esto se debe a que se escucha todos los dias ya sea en emisoras  restaurantes, o algun carro que pasa cerca de uno.      Nota: cuando digo bolero me refiero a aquellos boleros antiguos, y no a los que se graban hoy.que mas bien suenan como baladas. ejemplo los que canta Ana Gabriel. es mas estos boleros fueron creados por Armando manzanero.
