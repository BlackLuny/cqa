2rdXW293aa	I think the New York Times's opinion pieces are the best:    http://www.nytimes.com/pages/opinion/ind...    There are also some very interesting ones at truthout.org:    http://www.truthout.org/opinion|`|AA12324409	One I check every day is Andrew Sullivan's blog for The Atlantic. I would consider myself somewhat liberal, but I try to read Sullivan every day for a rational, alternative point of view. He's at http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/    On a more liberal side, you'll find lots of liberal writers at www.Huffingtonpost.com, or at www.buzzflash.com.
bJnqYE6maa	Well given the fact that China is the world's biggest consumer of OPEC oil, and that OPEC is composed of states that hate Israel's guts, and China has it's own Islamic problem in Mongolia... I would guess that China is on the side of Palestine... even if it is only for selfish reasons.    Personally, I think China will utlimately end up going to war against the Muslims in the far future.    Did you know China is colonizing all over Africa right now?  You should look at the website of the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	China recognizes Palestine and recognizes the right of the Palestinians to have their own state.    That is the extent of what I know regarding China's views on the manner. Russia also recognizes Palestine too from what I know, but regretfully the United States and most of the West still do not.|`|de50d8fa52217e49871467e36a4ef389aa	They probably side with the Palestinians but wont say so because of their ties with the U.S.|`|6eSRjnx4aa	China is smart.

I'm not sure about her.....I would sure hate to think she did.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder why they haven't made more about the gun they found in the ditch.  It was there for some reason no one just puts their gun there.  Was it his?|`|kJs0RmtXaa	they need to  charge him.

6978689d5750d49479f02abe1bc6a8e8aa	First, just so everybody, and particularly "Dcntamcn," understands, this is not part of the stimulus package.  This is a completely different bill.  What this is about is giving veterans benefits to Filipino soldiers "who fought under the U.S. flag during World War II when their country was a U.S. colony" and have essentially been forgotten (see link).  These are the same benefits given to American soldiers who fought in World War II.    Second, it's not 198 million dollars. It's 24 million for the first year, with payments to continue until they have all died.  Considering that most of the World War II veterans are in their eighties, at least, that won't be very long.    Of course if you think veterans don't deserve these benefits, then go ahead and protest.|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	welcome to the "say anything to get elected" democrat party.  i wonder what joe the plumber thinks now about obama? joe, joe, joe you out there?|`|lQao8Wt0aa	That's just the beginning - this is NOT a stimulus package, it's a payoff to those who helped Obama get elected.  Obama promised to be a unifier - the problem is he unified all Republicans with 12 Democrats AGAINST his stimulus package and divided the Democrats !|`|vq873faSaa	I don't get that... what's with giving all that money away?! It's not even gonna help the filipinos!
wi6mkT30aa	She knows shes prob going to be taken care of now that she has 8 babies I mean 14children OMG! This is crazy on her part.....    This is such a good question, because I just think it is so ridiculous that a none married woman, living at home with her parents, with 6 babies all under the age of SEVEN should NOT even be allowed to try to get pregnant again by a Dr. who implants the embryos. IT should be illegal!    I personally felt happy when I heard about the Octuplets I thought wow what a miracle! Now, I just think it's sad that these children are coming in to the world with a woman that is not prepared.     (This has nothing to do with single mothers, my mom was a single mom as well and she did her best. We didn't have much but she was smart enough to just have one child and take care of her responsibilities!)      This woman is now getting a "Free Ride" in the system for having Octuplets, and it's just crazy! She's going to get so many things for free and YES at first I thought this was great but until I found out she is just have babies after babies after babies on no good Solid ground, I'm just taken back and disappointed!    In this case i think the Dr needs to pay, why should we? She MADE this choice to have children who she clearly can't take care of.     I was wondering WHY she was so private about this! Now we all know, she's a careless person that is just having children for the wrong reasons. She needs to watched. Seriously how can a YOUNG woman take care of 14 children ON HER OWN without a husband and a home of her own. She doesn't deserve to even have these poor kids, but I'm sure the system or goverment or SOMEBODY out there will baby her and buy her a new home, clothing, dipars, toys...the things are listless!      This really makes me sick!    They said that she has  6 children ages 7,6,5,4 and 2 year old twins. They told her after she got pregnant with Octuplets to abort most of them but a few, I think that is just sad on the doctors! They should have talked about that BEFORE this even ahppened and didn't even allow her to do such a thing! Just sad!    Good question by the way, I needed to get that off my chest! lol|`|b5b08a7f14d2315049ad9f67246d2a56aa	I saw an article on the internet last night on this, she already has 6 children under 7 yrs of age, she's bankrupt and living with her parents  and what fertility clinic would agree to artifically inseminate her? This   is crazy all the way around|`|cPuicv06aa	I am appalled at this situation and I blame those doctors as well.  Here is as single woman with 6 children already all under 8 years old, unemployed and living with her parents in a very small home?  Not a good situation at all, and the hardworking taxpayers are going to have to foot the bill for this long journey.  Something isn't right here, that is my opinion.|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	It's appalling.  Someone should arrange to have her tubes tied.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	I'd like to know if she knows who the father of any of them are.|`|1c74cc7ee9876780e94d288d920e0d0aaa	Shame on her and the doctors who gave her invitro .  now this 33? yr old woman has 14 children with no husband, job, or home.  She lives with her parents.  Her own mother is disgusted.  All these multiple birth people drive me nuts with their t.v shows and freebies all the time.  They all sure enjoy the wealth.|`|aROi7KG5aa	Short and simple....It was not good at all.|`|jUSVvmiZaa	She probably figured she'd get the same attention of Jon & Kate plus 8 or any of the other shows that focus on large families.    Selfish, selfish, selfish.|`|in936M0Faa	Don't worry, Obama will make sure that the rest of us will "Share the Wealth" to help her out After all, Isn't that what Welfare is all about?|`|tkhBJMmhaa	I  can't believe they let this happen. Someone needs  to be review the Doctors and the mother because this is just insane and the grandmother stated that she didn't have to pay for this? What is that about crazy crazy crazy also who paid for the delivery no job is she on welfare? I mean this just blows my mind I have four children and I love them to death but good god I can barely get by. She is nuts and it is so wrong...|`|GTyq745Faa	Before you judge someone, even if you don't agree with what they did or are doing, you should always do a little research.    1) how do you know she was planning on having six more kids? I read she only wanted one more.  When you have invitro done, they always use as many eggs as they can.  If you were paying for that you'd want all the chances you could probably take.  So for you people to blame her or the doctor, please learn about the procedure first.  Everyone who has gotten this is told that there is a possiblity they may have more than one kid.  My aunt just did this on had twins, she wants to get it again and knows that she could have one kid, twins or even more.  It is something she will have to decide and risk.      2) how can you say that she is mentally ill?  Are you a pyschologist or pychiatrist? people used to have lots of kids back then and if you think about it probably couldn't really afford it either.  They had to make sacrifces, work hard, and not spoil their kids.  Why would you put her in a mental ward?  Do you even know what kind of people are there?  There are suciadle, schizophrenic, borderline personalities, depressed people.  That is not a place you want to be, even they don't want to be there and most people believe it should be a last option to put people in a mental ward.     3) why would you take away her children?  how would that help?  Now you have a whole bunch of sibling, possible split up and motherless.  Was it there fault?  Should they have to suffer and be placed in an orphanage? Or were you thinking that they'd magically be placed in loving homes the next day?    4) even if the kids were to get taken away, you're tax money would still be paying for something.  She may not need a reason to be on welfare, but your tax money still goes to paying the place where those children will end up at.    I don't have a solution to this problem, but I'm not going to sit here and critices a woman I don't even know, aside from what the media has chosen to convey. Please, before you open your mouth and start to critizes please think some things over.|`|8442530ea8a9cf2dcd52dae0c98a6862aa	I believe she is disturbed and should receive psychiatric evaluation.  I am appalled at the doctor's that performed the invitro procedure after she already gave birth to 6 children ranging from ages 2 to 7.

So the words octomom and octumom most likely come from the words octuplets and mom. To break it down even more I think the word octumom comes from the begining of the word octuplets and mom. The other word octomom comes from the prefix octo meaning eight and mom.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Because they can't spell.

The UN observer force continues to be present in Kashmir, without any result from the past 60 years. India has been labelled as an extremely 'soft state' by the US. Pakistan, although being a rogue state continues to get US support and aid. On one hand US shows sympathy with India, but on the other hand it wishes to enjoy a stooge like Pakistan in Asia. The fact remains that India has to be self reliant and strong if it honestly wishes to deal with the scrouge of terrorism. India has to stop all trade and social relations with Pakistan to begin with and has to keep on putting pressure on the International community of nations to get Pakistan declared a 'terrorist state'. India has to seal its porous borders with Pakistan effectively both on land and sea. Internally also India has to identify such people who aid and abet terrorist activities in India. It is such a shame that people like Sanjay Dutt facing conviction under terrorist acts is now being projected as a future political leader. Many anti social and criminal elements in India having terrorist links go scot free in India hence making its gullible and helpless population insecure. So called leaders like Amar Singh and Mualyam Singh give active support to criminals and terrorists because of short term political gains of garnering Muslim votes. The state of affairs is rotten in India and no citizen is safe in this country because of its corrupt leadership. UN or any other International body shall fail miserably like it always has been to cure the malady that is of our own making.|`|80fWQyDnaa	Why dont you try America first ?

OIQvZ87gaa	Yes, It is all entertainment.  There is no unbiased news any more.  It is all opinion and little fact. It is like they all get the same info each morning, feed it to us the same way and nobody notices.  Where does it originate? Who actually does the work?

Get 3- one from your city- maybe another city in the state- or 2 national ones like the NY times, Washington Post, USA Today.|`|AA11069376	No news program really needs to be more than about 30 minutes long.

Lx6TXgHKaa	It all depends on what you want to see. recession does not only have bad points only, it also has many good points. It forces the industries to be more productive, consumers to get goods cheaper, in general.<br>  <br>  I assume you are from US. It gives you people a chance to introspect and put your house in order. Current recession was brought about by the cumulative action of people who were chasing non-credit-worthy people to offer them loans. A lot of derivative based instruments amplified the effects further. It gives you a chance to put secondary market in order, inforce tougher rules. Your manufacturing sector is depleted and you have turned into gross consumer. You need to reverse the trend.

NMpbLtuTaa	The population growth rate in the Gaza Strip is twice that of Israel's and four times that of the United States'. All those brand new babies brought into a "concentration camp"?    The population growth rate in the Gaza Strip is 3.422% and the median age is 17.2. In the U.S. the population growth rate is 0.883% and the median age 36.7 years. The population growth rate in Israel is 1.713% and the median age 28.9 years.|`|VfowGdWLaa	No that does not look like a concentration camp.    Edit: Martina, don't you agree that the reason why people in Gaza live the way they do is because of Hamas and not Israel. If Hamas would use the boarders for clean business, and not to smuggle in weapons then Israel AND Egypt would allow the boarders to open. Hamas is known for hurting it's own people yet you only blame Israel.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	The average person in Gaza lives on less than $2 a day and, as compelling as your couple of photos of a few people, mostly one London journalist, are it doesn't actually change that fact. Nor does it change the fact there are people dying painfully from phosphorus burns caused by illegal white phosphorus bombs. Nor does it change the fact that Israel has blockaded these people in, most of whom Israel has forced out of their homes, and cut off supplies to food, electricity and water. Nor does it change the horrific death toll Israel inflicted on well over 600 civilians in 22 days. Nor does it change the disgusting death toll and mistreatment prior to that offensive.     I'm sure you feel you're being a shinning light humanitarian goodness, but your attempts at spreading propaganda for a country that's killed over 1,450 CHILDREN since 2000, and wounded many. many more really isn't convincing anyone else of your noble efforts.

g4nlUfmeaa	Didn't it work for early America at the beginning of the industrial revolution?  Of course, a lot has changed since then.    I don't necessarily support protectionism, though I do support the idea of a Fair Trade type policy.  Since it is possible for manufacturers to externalize costs by polluting the environment, and reduce costs by employing workers who enjoy fewer rights and protections to their health and well-being, and since there is very little pressure against those undesirable practices in a pure capitalist model, it makes sense that one of the roles of government would be realize the real costs of production, in the form of regulations/taxes/fines on domestic industry and implementing tariffs and other trade barriers when dealing with countries that are more lax in those areas.    Basically, I think the government should do what it can to encourage the adoption of economically and ecologically sustainable industry but otherwise (more or less) allow the global free market sort things out.  Arbitrarily erecting self-centered trade barriers is probably futile and counterproductive in the long run.|`|i7oHTo9haa	OK I didn't vote for Obama because I thought he lacked real world experience and if the stimulus bill excludes us with trade with our best allies just to "buy American" then that is survival at our allies expense. He's abandoning our allies to save our own skins?! He's ignoring the other worldly issues like what our allies need to defeat Islamofascism as um, we've got a war on our hands Mr. Obama lest we forget.     I'd rather see a strong West, including both Americas and EU than everyone ticked off at each other and not battling the real enemy.  I guess that's what Presidents do they think of their own countries first and that's one reason why l'm not President and he is?!  It's a global crisis though so we're all falling not just America. I don't support the bill not in the least as I'd just rather have a strong Western power where we all come out ahead not one where it's every man for himself.|`|AA11598210	~~I understand the importance of free trade. In this instance, it's the taxpayers dollars handed out to stimulate this horrible economic nightmare we are currently in.    With absolutely no jobs available, as well as taxpayers dollars being poured in to fix the Bush Administrations nightmare, I think as  a temporary "fix" it may be imperative to have this money only spent on American Industry. It helps two causes.    I do not feel it will be anything more than temporary as we all understand the importance of world trade. It's just imperative for the taxpayers to get the money into our own economy as well as provide jobs at the same time. Hope this makes sense~~

No country on Earth is a Saint. Even the U.S. (the only country that used nuclear weapons, and has weapons that can destroy the EARTH ten times). SERIOUSLY, what use are weapons like that? No, I don't feel "safer" because Iran is just like any other country.|`|tDvyf3Q5aa	Maybe my country, Iran has not enough international respect due to excessive religious thoughts and having a religious regime - which surely is NOT representative of Iranians - but of course Iran is not the first country to be worried about; comparing to Israel that has never respected the international nuclear protocols and invades countries, Iran is not a potential enemy to peace even gaining nuclear power (and of course not nuclear weapon).    What makes Iran so scary for western countries, is the media mafia that censors the ugly facts of the world.

ZKRe1Ycbaa	You don't seem to understand. It's only natural to want to pick away at it, because it's obviously why Israel gets away with what it does. If it wasn't for the holocaust, Israel wouldn't behave the way it does, because they know they'd be hauled into the Hague for it.    EDIT--I didn't say what happened in Gaza. I said the holocaust is why nothing will be DONE about what happened in Gaza. It's about getting away with it, nothing else. Nobody else would get away with that behaviour.|`|VfowGdWLaa	About the situation with Israel and Gaza you need to understand that Israel is not the one that starts that mess.

Let me get this straight, what did Jews exactly do to prevent this from happening, how did they allow millions to be slaughtered and why some of their own people were employed by the Nazi police to implement the 'final solution'. Every film I see about the Holocaust is always about somebody else saving the Jews, it's never the Jews themselves and in the end it was the UK and its allied forces that took the Nazis out.    Whatever the questions you might read about the holocaust, its there to remind them of what happened in their past and the double standards it holds in attempting to wipe out Palestine.|`|XpUF9f1Saa	The Holocaust was indeed an atrocity.    However, I always wondered why THAT was plated in gold while other atrocities similar to that are completely ignored? I mean come on, there are other holocausts in history and ones that are happening as I type this right now (that are the same or even worse). All those other holocausts should be remembered too.|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Agreed.    Although it was sickening and i know some would rather not think about it as it is depressing, they have no right to say it was 'right' or that it 'never happened'. Life cannot heal its mistakes if it forgets them all.|`|0NcRUSCoaa	100% agree with you.|`|l1qNr8gQaa	Religion=Murder|`|6Ow34Lokaa	There are many doubts about the holocaust mainly from overplay. Same thing goes with with calling people "antisemite" if they notice Israeli atrocities. The Irish never wail about Cromwell's holocaust, The Polish rarely moan about Russian mistreatment. Israel's constant genocide while crying about "we had a holocaust" is getting really old. The world is getting tired of these murderous neo-nazi Israelis who claim to be victims.

Great place to raise a family without any proper food, water, or plumbing system, your neighbor's building crashing down. Your building crashing down. At least the people of Israel can leave!

I must have missed that in reading the accords.    Hamas used a crowded civilian area to fire missiles, that's a fact.  They knew full well what would eventually result.     Why didn't they fire their missiles from the desert, here they could ensure no civilian casualties?      Do you, and Hamas, really think the world is too stupid to understand what takes place before our very eyes?  No, I'm not a Jew.  But I do resent being thought of as blind and stupid.    If you pull the tail of a tiger, don't whine when you get bitten!|`|bYtCfdwbaa	Because nothing has changed for Palestinians.Life for them is still horrendous,what do you expect?|`|JSjBecVHaa	Only the loonies and terrorist sympathizers get upset.

No food, no water, no electricity, very few medical supplies, thousands killed and injured, believe it not people will still be pissed off at the Israeli's.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Maybe Israel should've made the ceasefire with Gazam not America. Just a thought.     Israel is still cutting off supplies that are more desperately needed now than ever. Why WOULDN'T the Hamas fire rockets? Do you think they just threw rockets into a country that vastly out arms for fun?     And why do people get upset when Israel "retaliates"(although the use of that word in this situation is a bit ridiculous as it implies some sort of proportionality)? Because over half of Israels victims are civilians, many children. Because they commit war crimes. Because they don't allow aid to children. Because they executed civilian parents in front of children.  Because they used white phosphorus on civilians. Because they fire on UN targets. Because they fire at medics and ambulances. Enough reasons for you, or does over 400 children dead in 20 days not do it for you?|`|c819af3af49d8b8d19675e0d6c66de9daa	In agreement with Doh! Hamas is a terrorist organization with the stated objective of getting rid of Israel and all other Jews. Then they hide behind civilians when Israel strikes back. And the Gazans just sit in their ruined houses and wait for it all to be over instead of trying to throw Hamas out of power.

gRfqjemmaa	A lot of it is hyped up. The liberal media is feeding this to help Obama pass his socialist agenda. Actually Dec. was a very busy month for mortgages, home sales were up, did you hear any of that? I watched a mortgage expert talking about this. he said there was no lending crisis, for people with good credit, there is money, They are not lending to people with bad credit, dah. So, hence the so called credit crunch. When Obama believes he is ready, he will miraculously make a series of changes, and all will suddenly be OK. Amazing, huh??|`|wet127TIaa	personally i couldn't give a monkeys about the credit crunch,the poor will always be poor and the rich will always be rich no matter what happens.the rich people forget that its the poor people that make them rich,all they will suffer from this is they wont get so much interest on the money they have. my heart bleeds for them.  i don't think.|`|AA10690200	Bush lied, people died!  .... including 4000 soldiers!|`|NpZPYhaRaa	The problem was created when banks lend money, charging low interest rates in the beginning but increasing the rates as time passes, what caused the high number of foreclosures. Then the banks are stuck with houses which nobody is buying. To protect themselves banks are not lending. That is why the media does not have anything to do with it. People are not buying because they do not have much money available or decided to save it. People who do not have much money should be especially careful with their level of spending.|`|tO7Rpjmqaa	NO its all Bushes falt|`|DSLlioPcaa	Credit crunch was not caused by the world's media but caused by irresponsible lending/borrowing practices by banks/lending institutions and by some of the borrowers. Also, the problem was caused by irresponsible fiscal policies and loosening of financial policies by Bush administration. Decline in moral standard on political civility also could be blamed indirectly.

In short, anyone that does not follow the doctrine of the Liberal Main Stream Media!   Sean Hannity, Mark Lavin, Bill Bennett, Mike Church, all have said they have asked liberals on their programs, but will not go on. Liberals say that talk radio does not allow them a voice, excuse me? They have a VOICE on every main station in America, we have a small voice on talk radio that they want to eliminate. Why? Because they are afraid of the truth!!!|`|kn6Lrf6Raa	yes, its going to be like Zimbabwe very soon                    that frigging idiot Robert Mugabe...|`|Gy9kt139aa	Rush Limbaugh is an asshole...

I mean that is something that is done in a socialist country and this is not a socialist country. Also I don't think Obama's administration would do that.    Sarcasm|`|3bf411fb0977582b031f408308f1234baa	hell no!|`|a375l0D7aa	Interesting. The so-called "fairness doctrine" may very well be imposed which will require the airwaves to give equal time to differing points of view. Of course, if you ask the major networks, MSNBC will say it has Pat Buchanan and Fox will say it has Susan Estrich, so there!    But the fairness doctrine is not as important as what I see happening in America today. People who are pro-life or pro-traditional marriages are being told, frankly, to shut up cause they are being divisive. Republicans who wonder about Obama's Chicago connections are called "Racist". It seems to me that Obama supporters are so enthralled with the man that they do not want to discuss the issues.
Ut2MoCNLaa	Go to the local main library or unviversity library and look at the following as there will be very few articles listed on web sites.    I would suggest that you read the "Times" of London; the "London Observer" for articles appearing in Britain. Most here would be copy filed by Reuters News Agency or their own reporters.    From Australia I would suggest the "AGE" and the "Australian". Both again would have material from Reuters plus UPI and AP. The Australian may even have material from Agence France Presse along with their own reporters.    The "South China Morning Post" from Hong Kong and the "Straits Times" from Singapore would also be good sources.    Incidently, the Second Indochina (Vietnam) War was from 1954 until 1975 although historians will give several start dates for the war -- 1954, 1956, 1959, 1960 and February 1961 which the US military uses when the "First US soldier was killed in Vietnam". Actually there had been 7 killed between 1957 and 1961.
