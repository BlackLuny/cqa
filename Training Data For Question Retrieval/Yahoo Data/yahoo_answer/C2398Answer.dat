IGcS9K62aa	Use a standard structure. Paragraph 1-intro. Paragraphs 2-7- body, tell your story. Paragraph 8- conclusion.     In the intro you'll probably want to include something about how horrible events can be helpful learning experiences. In the body you'll want to start with the event itself. Let the reader know about the event, and how it made you and your family feel. Was it lack of activity and bad diet that caused it? What would happened if your grandpa continued to eat like he was? Then you'll want to get to the root of your thesis. Why did your family decided to get healthy? Were you forced to do it? (i.e. does your he live with you so you HAVE to cook healthy for him) Did your family decide to do it on their own? Why? Make sure you delve into what healthier means and how your family does it. If you include what it means to you that your family decides to get healthier you should be able to round it out as a conclusion and be done!    Good luck!|`|O4Zlnevzaa	Well, a narrative essay is like creative writing. Just pour you heart out unto the pages but remember to follow the topic sentence, supporting , commentary, and concluding sentence format. Otherwise you'll be fine. Why don't you just write how it affected you? And then your last paragraph can talk about your "becoming healthier". I think you should change your thesis because then in your whole essay you will have to talk about nutricion. How about: My grandpa had a heart attack on _____ and it changed my life.  That could be your thesis. Simple but sophisticated.|`|uvWjy8Aeaa	Write it as a time line. Begin with how the day began and how it happened. Explain the duration from the point the heart attack occurred and when the ambulance arrived. Go on to explain the events that transpired after. Then go into the area where your Grandfather is trying to persuade everyone to be more aware of their eating and exercising habits. You could then go on to explain what changes you have made in your diet and what exercise you do on a weekly basis.

Would the entire cycle fail without them? Without them, what would happen to us? Would we too fall ill or die?

AA11668242	The Keyes's model for economy, much different from the Classical model, proposes that the government has a huge role in stimulating the economy and it must expand the economy during a recessionary period with expansionary policies (decreasing taxes and increasing spending). Keyes urged FDR to implement deficit spending in order to bring America out of the Great depression. In fact, he criticized FDR for not spending enough.
lQIKWXDuaa	less than 12 credit=part time    12 credit or more = full time      ss|`|4vwF28RRaa	the difference is the number of credits you are carrying per term (some schools are on the semester calendar, others on the quarter calendar). if you are carrying at least 12 credits per term, you are considered "full-time." if you are carrying fewer than that, then you are considered "part-time." many schools will set the number of credits per course at 3 for sophomore classes and lower (200-level, 100-level, and 000-level (remedial) courses), but once you move into the 300-level and 400-level courses, they usually count at 4 credits per course. this also applies to graduate-level (500- and 600-level courses)   certain other courses are variable credit, such as practicum courses, like those for student-teachers, where they go to a grade school or junior high school and teach a class under the supervision of a certificated teacher.|`|Nin6IawVaa	Part time...if you take less than 12 units a semester.

Or you could take the kids to the zoo or a Park. Sometimes you can call around at like a theater and ask if there are any deals for class field trips. If so, have the kids vote on a movie to go see.    EDIT: Forgot to answer part of the question. You could use the trip for extra credit to some kids. If you go to a zoo they could bring a camera and use the pictures in a report about their favorite animal. Maybe they could pick the career they would like to have the most and write a report about why. If you go to the park you could even do something as simple as let the kids collect leaves and show them how to put the leaf under a piece of paper and make the imprint of the leaf, or how to press the leaves in a book and make a collage or picture about their day in the park. As for the movie theater, I don't know how big of a class or what age you are talking about, but we have a homeschool in the Yosemite area and they get awesome deals because they are a school, but don't have many students at one time.

4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	First thing you must to do is to pick ONE character from the story.  Usually, you pick the protagonist (main character) but you can pick antagonist if you want - but you could almost never pick minor characters.  (unless requested specifically)    Then, you'd analyze if this character remains the same through out the story or does he change.  If he changes, explain where, when, and why.  Is he a simple character or dynamic?  Is he angry?  Is he sad?  Is he ?  How does this character affect the story?    What you have to be careful is, if you say the character is such-and-such way, you must have a textual evidence.  In antihero words, you'd have to quote from the story and explain why the text lead you to believe the character is a certain way.  NEVER make a blank statement and have no support from the text.  Your teacher should have explained this.    Your introduction should contain the author's name, story's name, the character you are going to discuss, and the basic nature of the character.  Then, pick 3 main topic you'd want to discuss.  Then expand on it in body part of the essay.    This is just another academic essay.  You can pretty much follow the standard format.|`|pKXmVgRLaa	If you teacher did not give you any specifications or examples, then you can simply format it as a regular essay.  A character analysis "analyzes" all aspects of the character...physical, psychological, relationships with other characters, and most importantly, changes in the character.  You give evidence and examples to justify your characteristics...such as quotes.  Study the character's internal and external conflicts.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Usually you need to evaluate how the main characters changes.

3dd35f4296e39ccc21d4fb3dc0a4ba77aa	well if you are not going to be positive, then NO!   all you gotta do is to be positive. thats all. and if you keep on studying and getting good grades and mostly do everything the teacher says to do, then you will get into a good college.   Here's an idea;   if you keep on getting good/bad grades (or maybe even mixed grades), then no need to worry (or at least not alot), you could go to a community college for about a year or so, and then try getting into a good college. 1) it will save you alot of money, 2) you can't say that you are a dropout in school because you never got good grades and 3) your still going to a college! Also you can get more into the college life instead of starting at a big college. My brother did that and had trouble starting and making good grades! But i on the other hand, started at a community college!  Hope this helps. and im sry this was alot, but i thought this could help you, being your first day on this site!!|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	Well having more activities in high school can increase you chances in college. I failed two classes during my 4 years in high school and I never joined any clubs or anything (although I retook the classes) and I got into a good college (well it is a trade school and they just want your money but there are others they did not accept). And there are plenty of others. Just try harder, get up those D's and C's. The B's and A's are great. Try harder in just those classes and ask for help, do your schoolwork, homework, and ask for extra credit work.|`|ct8ebOk3aa	You did borderline okay, but don't sweat it.

Also, it really depends on what colleges you're aiming for. I didn't do as well in my freshman year, something I regret. You should try harder since you still have the time. However, you can recover because colleges need a cumulative GPA of all four years, not a GPA from each year.
FjMrNKneaa	Don't let anyone discourage you!  Colleges won't judge you based on your school; they'll judge you based on how you took advantage of what your high school offered.  Remember, students come from all different backgrounds - not just the wealthy private schools.  Make yourself stand out and make the best of what you have.  You seem to have a good head on your shoulders, and you're already right on track.  Keep your grades up throughout the rest of high school, and challenge yourself by taking the toughest classes your school offers, even if your options are limited.  You're already involved in sports, and doing well outside the classroom will only make you look better to the admissions officers.    Hey, I'm originally from a small town, too, where after graduation, almost everyone goes straight into the workforce, to community college, or to "easy" colleges.  But like you, I wanted something more than that, and I'm now studying at a top university.  I know it's hard to find support in your situation.  Most people just assume that you'll be satisfied doing what everyone else is doing.  But who says you should you be?  Talk to your guidance counselor, and let him/her know you're serious about college.  He or she she be able to help you find the resources you need, if your friends and family aren't giving you enough encouragement.|`|nT4qEeYKaa	Your high school has nothing to do with the college that you are accepted at. You can apply for as many colleges as you want and with your statistics you'll probably get in to most of them. You can also apply for as many scholarships as you want!|`|2ik6h1cHaa	Universities do not discriminate your acceptance based on your home or school.|`|Nin6IawVaa	If your application is good and you write a good college essay with good GPA, you should be able to get in..    Now Universities do cost a lot. People underestimate the power of community college. Community college offers same course work as Universities for first two years. You can save whole bunch of money for first two years. Then in the end of scond year you can transfer to a University for last 2 years.    You go meet a counselor in a community college and tell her/him which University you want to to and they will give you all the courses you need to transfer.    Good luck|`|RnZoKsHpaa	I do too but ive asked my concelours about this. Universities cant dicriminate against what highschool to go to. and besides with yoiu gpa you could get into MANY!  and theres are many ways to get money to help you like science fair in regional and national there are so many scholorships. you need to talk to your parents. first of all going to a good unniversity is something that should NOT be discouraged at all. you need to tell the that right now it may seem like a lot of money but youll apply for scholarships, you could get a job (in the summer so it doesnt affect your grades or put to much presssure on you)  and they are investing in your future. the extra right now will more than pay back when you get a really good job. there are also student loans. there are a lot of options so you could try speaking to teachers and councellors about scholorhips available. if i were you i would aask the teachers of the subjects you excell in the most. hope it helped :)! ps there are also magazines about universities and most universities have there own newletter so you could try subscribing or even checking out there sites.:)

As for converting grades over. Once upon a time C's were passing. Now a lot of schools are requiring B's or better to pass. I went to two high schools in one a D was passing in 75% of the classes. At the other if you didn't have a C+ you were screwed, C and C- didn't cut it. At my college it was a 75%, they preferred the number version since most rubrics allowed you to figure out what you needed as you went along in the class by a percentage.|`|fkuKUxrpaa	You may be mistaken, so I would check on that. Personally, I have never thought of anything of an A or B - or +. I have grown up getting A's and B's and no extra things. You either get a B or A. An 80 and a 89 is still a B to me. Your GPA may not be the same, but it's still a B. I have never gotten papers back with a + or - except for AP Human Geography, but that was an essay. I would call and find out to be sure. Also, every school is different. In my school a D is a 70%-73%, but in other places it is a C. It just depends on the school is all, and every school is different. Though, most schools use the same system. Good Luck!

AA10439008	1.  Multiply 0.75 by 115% as a decimal, 1.15.  Then multiply that by 0.95 as a decimal, 0.95.  This is because percents start at 100 and increase or decrease from there.    2.  Volume = length x width x height, and since 5 x 4 only =  20, the height must be 3 to get 60.  So the squares were 3 cm on each side, adding 3 + 3 = 6 cm to the length and the width, so it used to be 11 cm by 10 cm = 110 sq cm.

5682081015967f42594884ec81b2d107aa	Let Tf = time the stone fell  Let Ts = time for the sound to reach the top of the well  We are told Tf + Ts = 1.9 s.  The distance d the stone fell is  d = ? g Tf2  The distance d the sound went to the top is  d = Vs Ts  where Vs is the velocity of sound.  Since the sound goes the same distance that the stone fell, we can equate the two:  Vs Ts = ? g Tf2  Since Ts = 1.9 - Tf,  Vs (1.9 - Tf) = ? g Tf2  This can be rearranged to:  ? g Tf2 + Vs Tf - 1.9 Vs = 0; remember Vs = 343 m/s and g = 9.8 m/s2  The only positive root of this quadratic equation is Tf = 1.85 s. It took this long for the stone to hit the bottom. Substituting into the top equation,  d = ? (9.8 m/s2) (1.85 s)2 = 16.8 m.

50WCN0graa	Assuming you have your bachelors, it typically takes 2 years to get a master's degree in school counseling. You must have a master's to be a counselor. Part of the requirement includes a practicum/internship. This varies in length by state- in Ohio, where I am from, it is 700 contact hours.    I don't live in Florida, so I don't know what universities in Florida have school counseling programs, but maybe you could contact the American School Counselor Association (ASCA): http://www.schoolcounselor.org. Or, try doing an internet search titled "Counselor Education Programs In Florida."    As far as school counseling opportunities in Florida... Florida is actually one of the best places to be as far as job opportunities in education. Where I am they are sparse right now. However, in Florida and North Carolina, they really need teachers and school counselors.    How much a counselor makes varies by state and school district. On average, the starting salary is $35,000-$40,000/year. If you want to know specifics, go to some school district sites near you and look up the teacher salary schedule. School counselors follow the same salary schedule as teachers.    I love being a school counselor! I would definitely say go for it. It is an awesome job! If you want to go ahead and get the ball rolling... you will probably need to take the GRE to get into grad school. You could go ahead and get some "prep books" and study for that.    Best Wishes!

9Vy2SKbsaa	You seem to really care, so I would say yes!! You need to find a tutor, even ask your spanish teacher for help after school, thats what teachers are for. It might be beneficial to join a spanish club. Make sure you continue doing your home work, even when you don't know how to do it...teachers always give you points for trying. And that will also help you see where your weak points are.    Next, I would make sure that you set time aside every night to go over spanish words. Make flash cards!! It is a great way to remember words.     But, I think it is important that you get a "datebook" for school. It always helps me to write down in my calendar what I need to do that night, and when my test is coming up.     If you're making sure you do what you need to do, then you will pass this class easy!!

I think you are right about no indirect object.  Looking for might be an adverbial phrase with the object trouble.    Woke up from his nap, here nap is the object of a preposition, in that it is a direct object, I guess, of the preposition.  But it is considered a prepositional object.  Is that part of your assignment?  Then you would have subject, predicate, direct object, indirect object, prepositional object and adverbial object.  The word through is, also, a preposition, through the house.   Check with your teacher or your notes to see if the teacher wants those all to be called direct.  The little boy began trouble, would make trouble a direct object.  Maybe Aristotle and Socrates would call trouble the object of began in this sentence .

However, I have attended a university that, while it wasn't the best, it contained two departments that were some of the best in those fields.  Having been a part of those departments, it was a great experience.  However, it is important to distinguish and establish yourself academically as soon as possible.  I'm not saying that you should do anything to sabotage the attempts of others, as you absolutely should not!      However, your peers will be extremely brilliant people, and it is easy to become overlooked if you are intelligent and passive.

t2059Apeaa	The statistic in your second paragraph, "One out of eight kids each year are abandoned by their parents" put me off right away.  In the first place, there's no attribution; a stat that controversial definitely needs a source.  Second; think about it.  Kids, by definition, are children age 0-18.  If 1/8th of kids were abandoned yearly, in eight year's time, virtually every child in America would be abandoned.  Certainly this can't be true.  That bit of slipshod thinking ruined the whole essay for me.  (A clarification, perhaps?  Maybe it means one out of eight children are left with a single parent in a home split by divorce.  I guess that's possible, but they still have a home and one parent, and the abandonment may come to an end if the parent re-marries.  Further, a lot of divorced parents still have contact with their children.  That's the only way I could see that statistic as being accurate.)  Sorry to be harsh, but wild, unsupported quotes like that can throw someone off what might otherwise be a good idea.|`|5f4qvGLKaa	It is solid, but somewhat deserving of the score, maybe a 17/20, but that's where it falls.

No balanced teaching professional has a goal of ruining their students lives.  So grow up, get over it and stop blaming people.  It takes a great deal of empathy and dedication to be a successful teacher (but almost no work to gripe about one) and then get beat up by the system, the society and your own students for that career choice making it harder to deal with each year as an educator.     Many students who feel that their teacher is "mean" or "stupid" or "annoying" are actually too immature to recognize that sometimes it takes courage to make students acquire the skills that by law they need to survive in the real world.|`|effcf411158e260b084bb108fc448cc1aa	Yes, how dare these teachers make rules and try to liven up the content by making games?

I think the anal stage is when the toddler is going through potty training.  It's taught in basic psychology classes, so if you look up Freud, you should be able to find the history of the phrase pretty easily.    As for what it means now - it's a person who is excessively orderly, hygenic, high-strung, anxious, and obsessive.  Also known as a "Type A" personality  Many times they're a workaholic.
kmDjud0Maa	Well in political science it is named "prisoner's dilemma"- the background story being two crooks working a job together are caught and the police have them in separate rooms trying to get one to confess.  They tell each crook if he confesses he will get 2 years in jail and the other will get 20.  If both confess then they both get 10 years.  If no one confesses then they get 1 year.

rJRyVZhvaa	High school is difficult, different, memorable, and in some instances, interesting and fun.   It's how you handle your schoolwork, homework, home chores, social life (friends, family), and extracurricular activities.   The classes and schoolwork will be more challenging, sometimes non-understandable (because it's new to you). This is to ready you for the very difficult studies in college, or life.   You will have classmates that are absolutely rude and nasty, but that's just a taste of what's in store for you in college, and life in general. But do not let them make you feel down. You will have classmates that are your true friends, that will "stick" by you every step of the way, and help you out whenever you ask.  Also, there will be teachers that will be the same: some will be absolutely rude and nasty, and some that will help you and your friends.   There will be at least one subjects that you have a knack for, and can understand fully. Just remember to focus on your classwork, but enjoy yourself during school.  You will be surprised!!  All the best to you!!|`|w1pbRmazaa	It's only scary if you expect it to be. Just calm down. It's not hard, as long as you pay attention. Don't get stressed or it'll be a disaster.

It's good for ink pens, so maybe there might be help with a permanent marker.  Another thing I have used is lighter fluid, but have only used it while trying to get ink out of a dryer and that worked too.  I am not sure about clothing.  You might want to experiment on a simular piece of fabric and marker.  Never wash and dry the item or the dryer will set in the stain.  I would try the solvent first then wash with soap and water.  Scrub with an old toothbrush.  One time I had gotten a permanent ink marker on a white quilt when I put it on the machine.  I thought I had a  disappearing blue ink and it wasn't!  I used a q-tip and peroxide and it came out fine.  However, I was using it on white fabric already, so am not sure how it would do on a pink shirt.  Again experiment on a fabric that is simular.

But I would try rubbing alcohol|`|n5zZkbqNaa	Its important to remember that permanent inks and markers represent some of the most difficult stains to remove. If a permanent ink stain happens on a fabric or pattern that cannot be bleached, it will be difficult to impossible to remove. You can try and you might get lucky, but dont hold youre breath for too long.    The first solution to try is rubbing alcohol. Place the clothing on top of a clean white towel. Be sure to test in a hidden spot before applying rubbing alcohol to the permanent ink stain. Blot rubbing alcohol onto the stain. The towel underneath will become wet and discolored from the ink. Be sure to move the garment to a clean dry section fo the towel as this happens. Continue until no more ink stain can be removed. Make sure you rinse the stained area completely free of the rubbing alcohol.    Next try fingernail polish remover. Blot in the same way as you did with the rubbing alcohol, moving the stained area to a clean dry section of a towel as the ink stain is removed. Rinse thoroughly.    As a last resort, you can try acetone, although this doesnt do well with a lot of fabric types and cannot be used on acetate and rayon fabrics. Test first in a hidden spot. Apply the acetone in the same way as the rubbing alcohol and fingernail polish remover. Remember to rinse thoroughly.    Next, try rubbing baking soda mixed with water into the ink stain. Rinse thoroughly.    Apply a stain stick, gel, or spray to the ink stain and wash according to the fabric directions.    If the ink stain still remains after washing, try repeating the baking soda step again before rewashing and drying.|`|ys26TNwMaa	windex is really good at removing stains not sure about ink tho =/|`|soyYjOPbaa	god that is the not the worst thing, my dog died today so i had  bad day, you r so addicted to fassion!|`|f2240d2dc5cd27e0a679d6fe53d46128aa	stain stick? idk sorry...jst wanted to say i like the way your names spelled, never seen that b4, my name is ariana.|`|DbHx7ggCaa	you cant get permanent maker out of it without bleaching it and turning it splotchy and white.

wgFZGMEtaa	You are pretty much golden for most CSU's.  The only one's that could reject you are the CAL Poly's.    Now, if you get an SAT over 1700, you will get into UCMerced and UCRiverside, maybe Santa Cruz, Davis, and Santa Barbara, but unlikely.    Don't listen to the other response...  CSU and UC DO NOT ADMIT/REJECT BASED ON MAJOR!  They both have clauses that accept you as a student, not by your major.|`|jqIcKWgTaa	It always depends on which CSU/UC and prospective major and whether the program is impacted or not.

That would assume at least a 1650 SAT score for the UC's other than Merced.    With a high SAT score, 1800 plus, Cal Poly becomes doable.

AA10510845	While it's okay for black folks to use the "N" word among each other, it's considered inappropriate for a white person to use it.  The blacks use it as a nickname, just as they call one another a "brother".  It's sort of a suggestion that they are united, and it's always meant good naturedly. However, when whites use it, it's insulting to them.  It's sort of like when two old men see each other, and they say, "Hi, you old geezer," and slap one another on the back.  But if a young person would call an older man a "geezer", it would be insulting.  Do you get what I mean?|`|nBERj16Eaa	Maybe they do not see the double standard.  Most people (of all races & cultures) don't see their own double standards, until it is pointed out to them. And many people when confronted by others about their double standard, will become defensive.  Let's face it, the finite mind of man is  limited.  I think we're all like that, to an extent.        Jim|`|tXk1WngXaa	It's called reclaiming a word-making a word that has a  negative meaning and making it positive.  Other groups do it too.  Many women are trying to reclaim the word *****.  The gay community is trying to reclaim the word queer (which was not always negative).  The thing about reclaiming a word is that the opressor cannot use it, which in this case would be you, the white person.  It is up to the oppressed community to make it into something positive.  Reclaiming words are very controversial and not even all the people in whatever oppressed group agree that it is possible.  Even though your kid may be mixed, it is never, ever, okay for you to say the word.  Ever.  Just like it is not okay for a man to call a woman a *****.  Ever.

Sometimes staring at a book for 3 hours does'nt work, so you could try studying for half an hour and taking a 10 min break before getting back to your books.

As long as you file before the Federal deadline of June 30th, you will have the same chances of getting Federal aid as your chances if you filed on January 2nd.     However, many states and/or schools have earlier deadlines so you must apply before whichever comes first,  or you risk missing out on financial aid from those sources.

ogs0AZA3aa	Predator: An organism that lives by preying on other organisms. One that victimizes plunders, or destroys, especially for one's own gain.    Prey: An animal hunted or caught for food; quarry. One that is defenseless, especially in the face of attack; a victim.    In theory, there should be an equilibrium between predators and prey. Thus, when predators are scarce, the numbers of prey should rise. Predators would respond by reproducing more and, possibly, by changing their hunting habits. As the population of predators rises, more prey are killed and their numbers fall. Many of the predators then die; thus numbers of predators and prey oscillate between two extremes.|`|wE45hFQwaa	predator is wht preys on the prey lol|`|xlSlfApBaa	really.. Preedator eats prey, prey is eaten by predator. Predators are usually carnivores and occassionally omnivores whereas the prey is usually a herbivore, omnivore or carnivore (in that order)  The population of prey is thinned out by the predator.  Take for instance. An island off america (hypothetical) is populated by deer who travelled there on an ice bridge, since then the population has flourished and the temperature has insured no ice bridge forms again. However one winter an ice bridge does form and some wolves cross it, quickly deccimating the entire deer species which had evolved solely on the island. Hence the new ly evolved deer species is not extinct and the predators either return to mainland or stay on island to die (which doesnt really matter because there are more of their species on the mainland)|`|a4QEe8Twaa	Predators are the hunters    Prey are the hunted.|`|xKVMbHoKaa	predator is the organism that eats another organism  prey is the organism being eaten by another organism  the predator depends on the prey i think. cuz without prey, the predator won't survive.|`|4J2NGAMyaa	predator-  any organism that exists by preying upon other organisms.

Prey is when something gets killed be another thing.|`|vZkDHhklaa	predator - an animal that hunts other animals for food  prey - an animal that is hunted by other animals for food    When the prey population increases, the predator population increases. This causes the prey population to decrease, which causes the predator population to decrease. This causes the prey population to increase, which causes the predator population to increase... it basically just continues on in this cycle.|`|Czpfs8RLaa	Predator- one that hunts  Prey- The hunted  Thier populations are usually about the same because Say we were talking about wolves and rabits, The wolves eat the rabbits, if the rabbits overpopulate then the wolves start to overpopulate because they have enough food to feed thier young but when the wolves overpopulate the rabbits start to decreace in population so the wolves dont have enough to eat so they start to die off as well, hope that helps :)|`|fZfVM1unaa	Consider a common prey animal like a rabbit.  They have a pretty high reproductive rate.  There is a reason for that.  What would happen if you removed all of the rabbit's natural predators?    There are cases where deer populations get out of control, eat all the available food and then then end up starving to death.    Also consider natural selection.  Predators tend to pick off the weaker animals, leaving only the strong to survive and reproduce.    Good luck.

3Av4h1zgaa	Hi there,  Congrats on considering the awesome field!  The answers to your questions may vary depending on the type of center you are considering.......will it be a group care center or will it be a home based (family care) center?    You can start with the link below.  Click on Ohio and then look at the regulations, but again, you'll need to click on the type of center you will be opening.    Your best bet would be to find out the website for your state licensing agency.  Many states are putting the regulation handbook online for free download.  If Ohio's is not on line, you can request one from the state, though there may be a fee.    If you know anyone in the field in your state, they have a regulation handbook.  Ask if you can borrow it.    Good luck!|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	I googled "ohio licensing daycare" and found this link:    http://jfs.ohio.gov/CDC/providers.stm|`|n7mVqA3Raa	My sister-in-law did this for ten years. She turned her home into a licensed daycare for my 10 children. In Texas the guidelines for a home day care is different from a center. On her own she could have only 6 children in her home but if she hired another, she could have a total of 12.     If I were you I would prefer someone who has certified training with children. Many daycares hire those with no degrees or certificates but have to judge whether they be of good character and can do the job. I don't believe you have to have a degreed person to run a day-care but you have to do background checks. You (the owner) have to have license and insurance and certain city code standards in place to meet specifications of the state and the city. It's a lot of work! The state and the city comes to inspect your facilities to see if it meet the standards or requirements to service children. Your kitchen have to meet sanitation and health inspections. For so many rooms you have to have fire extinguishers in place. It is much but is doable.     I would contract my State Legislator and they should have pre-packets to send you on this kind of information.

IGSVfbGuaa	Good GPA. Try for a 3.00 at least, 3.5 if you can.  Extra cirriculars, sports, clubs, boy/girl scouts, volunteering, drama, etc. SO MANY POSSIBLE OUTSIDE SCHOOL ACTIVIES!!!  In these extra cirriculars, leadership positions.  Good SAT/ACT scores  job/intern/volunteer experience  higher level classes, a couple. AP, IB, honors, whatever, try to take at least 1 to 2 of these for as many years as you can.  Ethnicities, the state you're from, the country you're from.  If you known a foregin language, if you do which one is it, and how experienced are you in it.  Recommendations  Legacy  Awards  the essay you write to the college.    There's probably more too...anyway, various colleges will look at and weigh different things, no one can indefinetly tell you what some colleges want in their students, unless you are talking with the current dean of admissions. So, there is no answe. Be involved in clubs, but not EVERY SINGLE ONE possible, be involved for a few years, and try to get a leadership position.     I actually HATE what you are doing, asking what looks best on a college recommendation, and then being involved with that club. People should only do clubs which interest them, not the ulterior motive...in this case, resume boosting. I've heard colleges like FBLA, but that's it as far as I know, it may or may not be as big as some say it is.|`|rsB75xrDaa	all colleges look at class rank/gpa first, then SAT/ACT, then clubs (holding any sort of leadership position in a club helps a lot)  as for the clubs they will look at, academic clubs look best but  any will help. also, if you have stayed in a couple clubs throughout high school it shows dedication and sincere interest, as opposed to trying like 10 different ones.  if you have stuck with volleyball and softball throughout high school, that will look great on your application =)

Compare symbolist (defs. 3b, 4b).  6. the use of any of certain special figures or marks of identification to signify a religious message or divine being, as the cross for Christ and the Christian faith.
E135gdSXaa	I know exactly how you feel. I applied to William and Mary(out of state too). Hopefully we'll be rivals.    Your class rank is good enough. Easily. Don't worry about that at all.  Your ACT is really good.(It's like a 2070)  Your extracurriculars also seem to be very good.     Obviously, none of us can give you a straight yes or no because of the different criteria colleges have year by year. But if your essays and recommendations are good. I'd say you have an 80-90% chance of getting in. Good Luck.|`|hEFthejvaa	sounds good, my sister has a similar profile & she made it as well (but she was in-state). i'm not sure if you know but out of state schools makes your tuition almost double. so i would consider going to a school in your state but if you really love UVA then you'll definitely make it. make sure your acceptance essays are really good (it has to prove what makes you different & unique from average students). best of luck.|`|IGSVfbGuaa	Seeing as how I've never heard of the University of Virginia....I'd say you're sure in. You have several extra cirriculars, a good GPA, great class rank, and a standardized test score. But what about your SAT?    It seems as if you are very confident you would get it, why ask?|`|695a1f35442f9b98085dcc4c83fbeddfaa	You have as good a shot as just about anybody out of state.  You have put together an incredible transcript.  However I would still recomend applying to several other schools just to be careful.  Good luck :)|`|m67wUGvxaa	Don't rule it out just because your out of state. You have GREAT credentials and have a good chance of getting in. I would write a an essay on why you want to attend UVA, that'll be the cherry on top.    Good luck=)
695a1f35442f9b98085dcc4c83fbeddfaa	Here is my recomendation take classes at the community college online such as your general sciences, english, math, and other classes, get some credits and tranfer when your daughter gets older and go part time.  If you go to school part time like at nights you might be able to work or take care of your daughter the rest of the time.  I believe that in order to graduate with a degree from a school at least the last year (30 credits) has to be completed their.  You could definately get a year or two of credits out of your way and transfer once your home life gets more stable.  Way to go and good luck.|`|SIhxrxD3aa	You can take some of the pre-requisites on the internet.  For example, social sciences, english, and math.  However, any course with a lab will have to be taken on site.  Even if the on-line course claims to be a lab the vet school will not accept this course so don't waste your money with it.  Also, any of the more advanced science courses will have to be taken at a 4 year university or the vet school won't accept them.      I hope you understand how time consuming and stressful vet school is.  You are in class all day long and must study in the evenings and weekends.  It's like having 2 full-time job.  You will NOT be able to work while in vet school.  There are people in my class with families, but it's very hard for them.  I hope you have someone that can help with your small child while you attend vet school.    There are no vet schools that offer on-line only degrees.  If you've run across one, or a vet that's claiming to have gotten a degree on-line know that it's a scam.|`|8UITNpVoaa	depends what contry/state ur in|`|JvrLyYGQaa	Any college degree you strive for requires that you have the basic's out of the way. Just make sure that the online credits you recieve are transferable to the college you plan to attend. If not you will be wasting alot of time.   More importantly, you really need to find out what you will need to get in to Vet school. So that you can begin to make long range plan's to achieve this goal. Ohio State basically say's that you need to have a 3.5 gpa, done some kind of animal internship,(i.e.-worked for a shelter,helped a vet,done some animal related work) before they will consider youe application.

That way if you can't break into acting, you will always have a college degree.    ss|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	It is never never too late to go to college.  People go to college after they've done all the rest of their lives and retire from their jobs (and so have the time to devote to studying).  And some of us continually take college classes just to keep up with this changing world.|`|Nin6IawVaa	No! People go back to college at the age of 55. You are so young. You can start by applying to a community college. Just go there and complete an application. It's only 2 page long. You can just complete there and give it to them.   After completing application, go to Gincial aid office and comeplete pick up the forms and submitted before school opens up. You can actually start in Fall of 2009.  Make sure you go meet a counsleor and get list of general course work list and list of courses you need to transfer to a 4 year University.    Do good in college and you will be transferred to a good University.    Don't worry about major...you will find out once you start to take those courses in community college.

Buy something when you know it is right for you and not to please a high pressure salesman. A truly good sales person will get a bad name if they keep this tactic up. Don't be sucked into "Get rich quick" schemes. There is no easy quick way to make money. There are plenty of suckers out there that think there is|`|9tMDxwHeaa	I just tell them no. It seems that if you "open the door" and say you'll come back when your ready, they just keep calling. I just startd telling sales people No, under no circumstances am I going to buy.

And if and when you do decided to buy, they'll be very nice cause they want the money|`|cIheKVRmaa	I would politely remind him that the unwanted pressure is helping you form a bad impression of the organization.|`|ul79DG2kaa	Tell them that you will not be taking anymore of their calls or e-mails and that any further attempts at contacting you will be deemed as harassment.

It is harassment.|`|W9GblEAjaa	Tell him that you would have bought the membership but his pushiness turned you off so you aren't going to buy one now.|`|bJjaRs83aa	Stick up for yourself.

You have to call him back and explain that you don't want any part of what he's selling because he is a sleaze. Tell him exactly that. Tell him that the more he pushes, the more he makes your skin crawl. In other words, tell him the truth. Tell him he sounds like a pimp. He doesn't know jack about what he's selling; he just needs to make sales. You have a bullseye on you.|`|98lD3z68aa	First, you need to understand the organization of the Chamber of Commerce.  The Secretary is the paid manager of business operations and is interested in the funds raised through membership and other activities.  The President is a businesaperson who was elected by his/her peers, and is interested in the group increasing the prestige and success of its members.  You should write to the President AT HIS/HER BUSINESS ADDRESS and explain what has been happening to you.  You should question why these tactics are used if Chamber membership is truly a value to your business, and state that you will not consider membership because of this aggressive sales technique.  I would also question if the sales jobs are commissioned or salaried, and if they are commissioned, if this is because there is little value in membership.  Most Chambers are well-intentioned but not particularly efficient.  Ask for a report showing revenue and net profit increases because of membership.  I doubt you'll get any more calls.

936bf625f4f69abc196a5cbf095ab4b7aa	It is only acceptable to repeat a word several times within an essay when it is the subject. If you are using the same adjectives over and over, for example, I'd suggest grabbing a thesaurus (or using one online). Using the same word more than once in the same sentence is something I'd always advise against, though.<br>  <br>  You don't need to repeat words to 'stress a point' because it can get a bit monotonous. If you're finding yourself repeating ideas, you may want to brainstorm a bit more to bulk up your essay by including more points.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
1khVEE6oaa	Before you pay for a tutor, have your brother check with his math teacher.  Most teachers or schools offer some sort of tutorials before or after school that are free.  If those are not available, his math teacher might still have a good suggestion for tutoring agencies.  I can't suggest a specific place to you, because I don't know where you live.  But you could check your phonebook for nearby tutors or do a google search, "tutor near [city, state]" once you fill in the city and state in which you live.|`|50WCN0graa	I would suggest asking a school counselor... they often have a list of teachers who are tutors in your school district. The tutor will charge you, though.    Have your brother ask his math teacher for extra help... usually teachers are willing to stick around before or after school to help if you ask for it.    Do not enroll in the expensive tutoring programs. They are a waste of money and don't typically follow the school curriculum.|`|T547TtDRaa	Don't go to the professional tutoring companies.  Go to a local junior college, or college, and post an ad in their career center.  Try the tutor for a few lessons to see if that person is a good tutor. If not, look for another tutor.  Be sure you're in a SAFE place, or that your parents are home when the tutor helps you.  Also, go to a department chairperson at a high school to see if he/she has a good person in mind.  Good luck.
3tDqt9sXaa	try and job shadow  help out at the elementary school  tutoring  even babysitting will help|`|lCtl1L3kaa	First, I'd say just relax and enjoy the next few years of high school.    In the first two years of college, you'll have to take a bunch of "general education" courses before you start on the things for your major.  Everyone has to do these, but there will probably be opportunities in high school to take college level classes and get some of them out of the way before you leave high school.  Talk to your guidance counselor and plan it out.    Is there a special magazine for agriculture that you could subscribe to?  You'll have an easier time in college if you start following some of the trends happening in the industry now.      I don't know much about agriculture, but summer jobs at a nursery (the kind with greenhouses)  may help, or at least be fun. Or maybe some other local farm?  Either way, if you have a passion for agriculture, make it your hobby somehow.  Read books, learn independently.  Are there any kinds of clubs like 4H in your community?  This would be a great way to get community involvement stuff to add to your college applications.  You'd also learn a lot, and get some leadership experience.    Other than that, just work hard in school, get into a good college, and you'll meet your goals.  You sound very dedicated!|`|FmYkUfIDaa	If you are serious about becoming an agriculture teacher in vocational schools, then you need to get some hands-on practical experience during school holidays. 'Work experience' at a local farm.    See the experience as being at school, therefore, take a notebook and pen with you at all times.    Go see someone who is doing just that and ask them how they got their start.    Study related material, make notes as you go; that will be a useful resource for you when you eventually get to teach.    Get yourself a lever arch file and title it - Agriculture Resource Material. Everything you collect or write-up, you file in this file and by the time you are ready to teach, you will have lots of information - you may even have put Lesson - Plans together?    If you have the opportunity to view any TV programs on the subject, do so - here in Western Australia we have a program called Landline - you may be able to go to Google and download information. Type in - Landline Australia TV.    Best of luck.|`|6ab3673bb81ad84f3158efb113c25ce3aa	u can start tutoring small kids to see if you can really handle it in the future|`|C5E2liU8aa	Stay in school and do well.

Anything that gets you in a 'teaching' role and with students.
IGSVfbGuaa	If it's a FAIL as in an F, I think you'll have to get the credit still, unless you already have your fine-art credit, then I don't believe so (graduation-required credits, 3 math, 4 english, etc). A D you will be safe, I don't know about an F. But if it's only ONE class, it will be ok, especially a class such as art (if it was a math class....you'd be screwed). In any case, write a letter to the college explaining WHY you got a bad grade in that class.    Congrats on getting accepted into the college you want to go to. While it may not be as well known as wake forest (which isn't that amazing anyway), it;s higher learning past highschool, so you are overachieving already.

WAGpAh8oaa	play sand that you buy at walmart|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	Schotch tape is cellophane.    Cellophane is a thin, transparent sheet made of regenerated cellulose. Its low permeability to air, oils and greases, and bacteria makes it useful for food packaging.    Cellulose fibers from wood, cotton, hemp, or other sources are dissolved in alkali and carbon disulfide to make a solution called viscose, which is then extruded through a slit into a bath of dilute sulfuric acid and sodium sulfate to reconvert the viscose into cellulose. The film is then passed through several more baths, one to remove sulfur, one to bleach the film, and one to add glycerin to prevent the film from becoming brittle.    A similar process, using a hole (a spinneret) instead of a slit, is used to make a fibre called rayon. Chemically, cellophane, rayon and cellulose are polymers of glucose and contain the chemical elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen

(1)(x^(-7))  -----------       2    but since you have a negative exponent (-7), you take the reciprocal, or "put it on the bottom."

AA10948829	Yes, you can do that. Just make sure you contact the university you plan on attending after CC and make sure they will accept the credits the CC will give you.

But some universities don't accept ALL credits from community colleges.  Be sure to check with the university's web site, and there should be a site that tells you which credits they accept- and from which CC's  Universities are waaaayy more difficult than community college.  So when you do transfer, don't **** up...|`|fe73dc32e71ef5846abbf8e72834c313aa	You can go to CC and get your associates degree in 2 years and your bachelors in 2 or 3 years at university.

lbR1IoiSaa	If you're really good at math, and into science, you're perfectly suited for any type of engineering field of study - and any type of engineer makes SERIOUS ca$h!   If the term engineer throws you off balance because you're picturing some dude with a hard hat on, don't let that boggle your mind.  Do some research on the different types of engineering specialities, and see if you could see yourself doing it.    Also, I'm not sure where you're thinking that people with professional computer / IT training and education are not in demand, this is a VERY demanding field, there are NOT near enough qualified professionals to do the job, and the ones that do - are paid well!     Do a search on any job site (careerbuilder, yahoo hot jobs, monster etc) for computer professional, or IT professionals, and the pages are limitless!       Also, remember, computers are going to be with us ALWAYS from here on out, so - even if in your particular locale the demand may not be that great, there'll always be a need!     Start visiting the local technical college career center for free help, and access to available resources.  Ask if they would let you sit in on a course in each subject area.  You could also do this at a university, but they're less likely to let you :(.     Good luck, and reach for the stars!|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	How about engineering?

695a1f35442f9b98085dcc4c83fbeddfaa	Sometimes majoring in something other than biology or chemistry puts you at an advantage because it shows that your a well rounded individual with multiple interests and skills.  So long as you remain dedicated and work to show that you are commited then it should not hurt your chances.  I would try to volunteer or work in a dentistry setting to get some experience that always looks great.|`|IzmVQRBZaa	Yes  As long as you do the prereqs it doesnt matter what your major is. Just do what you like.|`|8RHBNAfhaa	I'm a bio major now-I'm into my second year and I'm pre-med. It's true you can major in whatever you like. One of my roommates is actually a Spanish major and is pre-med. Personally though, I figure if you need to take all of the bio and chem classes-why not just major in bio or chem? I'm minoring in a foreign language, in order to show that I'm not just "science minded." I look at it this way, if I don't get into med school there are plenty of jobs in the health field even if you're not a doctor. (physician's assistant, pt school-plus you'd technically still be a doctor, and many more.) I just think you'd be killing two birds with one stone by majoring in bio or chem.|`|pt6wIlS1aa	It's fine to major in anything you like as long as you get the medical school pre-requisites in. Both computer science and bioengineering are great choices, and you're right, both lead to good careers without requiring more schooling.    Not sure what you want to know about computer science and bioengineering programs, but you can visit the websites of colleges you're interested in to see the courses offered and required for each of these. The info will be in the Academics part of the websites.

pmN86odLaa	I took a lot of practice SAT tests to get used to the types of questions that were asked and the way the sections were timed.  Afterwards, I would review each of the questions I answered incorrectly and studied up on the material.  One of the books I found helpful was The Official SAT Study Guide.      Some of my friends (the ones who had money O_O) took an SAT prep course with Kaplan.  Some of them found it pretty helpful because the instructors went over a lot of the more commonly asked types of questions and subjects.  However, the course is pretty expensive ($1000), and a bit time consuming.|`|SDSmotQiaa	spread out studying time, maybe do a prep class|`|rsB75xrDaa	Honestly, the best strategy is just to keep taking it until you get the score you want.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The salary really depends on the school.  I know CC profs making less than 40k just starting out, others making more than 100k with 20 years and tenure (and in a wealthy location).  Both have masters degrees in their fields.  The jobs are a bit competitive, especially at the moment since so many places have hiring freezes - they're just taking adjuncts, and paying them crap (but it gives you experience for the next job).  I made less than 25k as an adjunct at a full university.      Here's a good site that lists current job openings, expected qualifications, and sometimes salaries for universities, colleges, and community colleges in the US.  http://www.higheredjobs.com|`|5ajPMlrqaa	There used to be a blog called the invisible adjunct. It no longer exists. But you can read about it here: http://chronicle.com/free/v50/i34/34a010...    And the writer of that article would puke, laugh, and/or cry at this question: Do adjunct CC professors have more than one job? The answer is yes, they do have more than one job typically. More than 45% of college profs are adjuncts, and for each course they teach, they only make about 2k. Which might sound like a lot, but it doesn't account for class prep, grading papers, office hours they're supposed to hold. Most adjuncts also don't get the "privileges" that tenured faculty have - keys to an office, an office of their own, a phone to make calls on, a desk, office supplies, etc.     Here's another website where you can google the phrase "adjunct" and get a load of info:   http://www.insidehighered.com/

Make a slightly bigger tube of the remaining cardboard place the smaller tube inside. Fill the space between the tubes with breakfast cereal (choose one that crushes easily - rice bubbles or corn flakes would work).    Close off the ends of the tubes and use string to tie them shut. When it's dropped, the rubber bands will act like shock absorbers, the cereal between the tubes (and the corrugations in the cardboard) will crush, and your egg should be safe.|`|6eVyP3xpaa	make the walls of the box as thick and soft as you can and use your rubber bands to support x, y and z axes.(remember to tension them properly and test it before the real test).

ORonhAuvaa	Your district may have a "within district" credentialing plan in which you can just take a test. Since you need to be highly qualified to teach kids with mild learning disabilities, then teaching special ed high school math may be an option as you are already highly qualified.    Each district and state had different certification rules. You probably should discuss this with your district personnel specialist. For instance, I had a Handicapped Learners certificate to teach in Oregon. However, California wanted me to take the whole credential over again, so I just moved to another state that handed me the credential and 9 years of service.|`|J9j9B8BAaa	In California, yep.

Bce5bG8Xaa	Not sure why Haiti is your chosen country but if you have a real teaching degree you can teach almost ANYWHERE in the world.  If you get a TEFL you still have a lot of possibilities and the two together while not mismatched are not both necessary.  I've taught overseas for years on my MI secondary certificate in Social Studies.   It's an adventure, the pay - while lower is something that is easier to save due to lower living costs, you can afford to hire domestic help, and see the world at the same time...  I think you're making a good choice if you have the spirit to be away from friends and family for long periods of time.     With a real teacher's degree you don't need a TEFOL certificate if you teach at an American International School.  These schools host students whose parents want them to learn the American Diploma in an English speaking setting.  So, you want to look into the following:    University of Northern Iowa Office of Overseas Teacher Placement - this program holds a fair (going on this weekend) where teachers from around the US and the world come back to meet with administrators from everywhere.  This is a "free" fair meaning you don't pay UNI a fee for finding a job.    International School Services and Search Associates are "for profit" versions of the UNI original.  Generally you need better qualifications and more experience to compete at these fairs and there is a charge of around $700 extra if you get a job through them.    Google them and you will find their websites and plenty else about them.  The process of applications starts as early as October for the fairs that follow in and around February.

OkkTDQr5aa	yes, my second semester starts monday too. I currently have a 3.95, and what I do is that as soon as a get home, I start homework, and afters its done, i study for any tests. To study for tests, I repeatedly look over notes and read the book and take notes. To remember important facts, always write them down, and recite them in your brain.

I usually study an hour before or the day of the test so I can remeber the material. And for remebering important facts, I never remeber the whole thing, jus pick certain words that relate to it.    And to stay active all day, I would tell you to workout in the morning but that goal seems impossible accomplish.

uvWjy8Aeaa	A personal experience can be anything that meant something to you. I am not sure how old you are but a personal experience can be something like learning to ride a bike, or ice skate. It changed your life because it made you proud of yourself that you were able to learn it and do well. Can you play an instrument? dance? Do you have siblings younger than you? How that affected you is a personal experience. That definitely changed your life.

oVxr5B3Eaa	My school used to sell them.

Every time the kids are walking somewhere in the hall they see things and many of my kids have spotted things that belong to them that they didn't even realize they had lost. It's nice because they can see everything, not just the things on top, and they don't have to dig and dig. <br>  <br>  I'd suggest at the beginning of every school year and once in a while throughout, send a note home reminding parents to label EVERYTHING with their child's name or initials. At least your school sends the stuff to good will and doesn't throw it away.

5ajPMlrqaa	I don't think it is a matter of whether or not it is possible, I think it is a matter of what you will have to sacrifice and do in order to make it happen. If you have a good support system of close family that will help you, that can make all the difference.   It's hard to give specific advice without knowing exactly where you are in your education - you don't say if you're both still undergrads, or if you've finished undergrad yet. So I think that with your ambitious goals in mind it's safe to say that it will be hard, and it can be done, but you have to have a fair amount of certainty that you really want it, or it will be too easy to give up.  You talk about these decisions as if they are both intertwined. You are having a daughter together, but are the two of you really committed to a romantic relationship for life? If not, then she really doesn't need your approval or anything of that nature - she can make a decision however she wants. Same goes for you. You'll need to coordinate child care & the like, but with a baby on the way, you really must resolve the question of marriage - do you see yourselves becoming a true, legitimate family unit?

5ajPMlrqaa	Get a planner and write your schedule down in it. Include your work schedule & any other commitments.  Your campus should have a fitness center - schedule workouts there at least 2 times a week, and make yourself go! When you do cardio workouts, you will get to a certain point in the workout when you reach some mental clarity - it is a very good feeling & particularly beneficial if you struggle with depression.  Use your weekends also - don't just sit around the house all day - split your work into small increments & it will add up to large amounts of work that you can get done.   If you are addicted to the computer, work it to your advantage. If you have a laptop, use it in your lecture courses - it can help you take fierce notes that no one else can rival!|`|csNzoGNZaa	Start Studying, Pack cute clothes, Get organized, Get a binder and Have Fun !

lbR1IoiSaa	My opinion is as follows:    ANY education is still of value 20 yrs after it was conferred (diploma granted).   Although they are somewhat older, it shows that your step-mom HAS the ability to be taught, and to learn, and realistically, this is what counts the most - not so much what it was in - although her combination of a BS or BA in teacher education, and a MSW are a POWERFUL combination, and she should NOT, under any circumstances, be settling for a chili dog business :(.      Now, as an adult who's known others who've made a mistake or two in their life - give your mom a break, and try to be more understanding and supportive, and not so critical.  Also, try - while you're being more supportive and understanding, getting to the bottom of why she's not apparently interested in working in her field, or at least earning more $ and I'm sure - having better benefits.     Is it:     Does she have something in her background that she hasn't cleared up, that shows up on background checks, that she needs to address.  If that is the case, the higher level position she goes for, the more in-depth background check they do, and this could be holding her back.  If she does have something in her background (don't expect her to admit it), just say "If it's something in your background Mom, why don't you try to fix it, work to get it off your background etc" - there ARE ways - and if necessary, law students who would probably be glad to help her write letters, quote statutes etc.     Is it that your mother is just plain old tired of the rat race, taking home a work phone, being on call and all the other bullshit that comes with better positions?  Sometimes, and this I know from experience, we just need to take a 'no-brainer' job to decompress etc.      Is she lacking confidence?   If she doesn't feel good about herself, her hair, her make-up, her clothing, her skin (wrinkles, acne, sun damage) etc, this will all influence the way she presents herself to others, and after being 'dismissed' and not told, "you're hired" often enough, it can weigh you down.  If this is part of her 'problem' - maybe you can give her compliments, help her with her make-up, her clothing, her 'style', etc.  Maybe she doesn't know how to make herself look so great on paper, and could benefit from a professional resume writer to write her resume - knowing how to emphasize what will work!    Whatever the issue - you can only do so much to try and help - but to help, you've got to be more supportive and less critical, despite how you may truly feel.   After being more supportive and encouraging, and less critical, if she still doesn't open up or seem to want to make any changes, LET IT GO, and just realize that it's ultimately HER decision when it comes to what she does with her life, and although it may be a bit embarrassing for you - it should not, you cannot control your step-mom, and what she does with your life, it does NOT reflect on you.  If she's happy doing what she's doing - - - is she hurting anyone but herself???     Your step-mom - in my opinion, should be looking at taking a certificate course in some field she'd like to potentially work in again - to refresh her knowledge.  She could also seek FREE counseling from the local college career center, and if your family has the 'disposable income' - perhaps she could have a few meetings with a professional career counselor - if anything, they could get her mind stimulated and forward-looking again!    Areas that I think your step-mom's education would qualify her for a nice position:    Human Resources  Training Department  Marriage Counselor  Guidance Counselor in maybe a middle (junior high) school  Academic Counselor in an adult education setting (college, technical college, career college, heck - even a university!)    Mediator through the local courthouse - many times they are required to have an MSW.    Good luck, and just be very encouraging, supportive and sweet.  "Wow, Mom - or whatever you call her - I didn't realize you knew that, you must've learned that in college!"   "Wow Mom, you're really smart."  "Hey Mom, tell me about your college days, what were the classes like, what classes did you have to take, . . . . ?   Ask open-ended questions so she has to elaborate, and maybe you'll stimulate that 'learner' in her again - and she'll start thinking more about how talented and educated she really is - and will want to use it?    If all else fails, then remember this, what she chooses to do does NOT reflect on you, and:    Ultimately though sweetie:    You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink :(.

81ZqCu42aa	Capitalism is when there is private ownership. For example, USA is a capitalism country because people have the right to start their own business.    Main features of capitalism:  -What is produced, how much, and prices primarily determined by supply and demand.  private ownership  -profit-motive is good for society  -competition is considered good    Socialism is state or community ownership of the means of production for the common good. Socialism is similar to communism because there is no private ownership and everything is owned by the state or government. Everyone will get the same amount of wages and pay the same amount of taxes. China and Russia are considered Socialism.|`|2IhTcTBRaa	Socialism happened in world War II with Hitler.

(And it has to be that way: imagine water companies competing for your business, tearing up the streets constantly to lay their own pipelines etc.  Plus, providing water to remote locations that don't have wells would be unprofitable, therefore, people in rural areas would have to do without utilities.)  Capitalism is when one borrows or invests his own money to operate a business, such as opening up a restaurant.  The government has minimal say over how you run the business, as long as you mind health codes and don't poison your customers.|`|0d4c779ef4fea2affb8c852c3ba056afaa	socialism = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism  ie Russia of old  capitalism= http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism  ie America
N8DC9foaaa	Hey there!    I think sometimes parents aren't sure what to do to help their children, especially if you are a teenager.  Let's face it, teenagers begin to retreat from their parents as they begin to try and find themselves. It sounds like you know what you need.    It is time to ask for what you need.  I think if you are upfront with them, and say - I know you would like me to have good grades, but here is the deal, I am a procrastinator and it would really help me if you would get in my business a little and pressure me to get my work done. Tell them that you need it... that you might not seem like you want it, and you might give them a bad look when they bug you, but you need them to be on your case. Discuss your projects with them and ask that they check with you and if you are not on task, they give you what for.  The common trend with teenagers is not to get on their case too much or the teen will withdraw even more. They might be trying to give you some space.    If you do not feel comfortable telling them this - write it down - give it to your mom or dad as you leave for school. You might be surprised by their response... :)  if you parents are still not comfortable being on your case, I bet there is a teacher at school that would respect the request, allow you to sit in their classroom for tutoring and make your accountable. (I used to have about 2 - 3 a year where I was their pain in the behind - but they asked me to be.)    I am sorry this is giving you stomach pains... that just goes to show you need to do something about it. Maybe you could write it this weekend and give it to them Monday morning.    Best Wishes - knowing what you need is the first step to getting it!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Your parents aren't always going to be there to motivate you. You have to find a trick that will work for you.

However in both situations, pay attention to those word/ words which appear to control the meaning of whole sentence and note them down.

Do you have a former History prof who would praise you in a letter?. <br>  <br>  With a halfway decent GPA, they might consider you for some programs if you can demonstrate exceptional talent in that particular field.

You could use it to obtain a computer, school supplies, etc... In the thank you note you could say that the scholarship will help you on your path to achieving your goals, i.e. getting a bachelor's, associates...It probably doesn't have to be specific.  Normally, grants and scholarships are meant for tuition, books, and living expenses while you are going to school, but if it exceeds what you need, you may be asked to provide proof of how you spent the money, and you may have to pay tax (or pay back the extra) on the excess funds.  Though, many students at my college have received refund checks in great amounts and have never had to pay tax or pay it back.

In general, parasites are much smaller than their hosts, show a high degree of specialization for their mode of life, and reproduce more quickly and in greater numbers than their hosts. Classic examples of parasitism include interactions between vertebrate hosts and diverse animals such as tapeworms, flukes, the Plasmodium species, and scabs. Parasitism is differentiated from parasitoidism, a relationship in which the host is always killed by the parasite such as moths, butterflies, ants, flies and others.<br>  The harm and benefit in parasitic interactions concern the biological fitness of the organisms involved. Parasites reduce host fitness in many ways, ranging from general or specialized pathology (such as castration), impairment of secondary sex characteristics, to the modification of host behaviour. Parasites increase their fitness by exploiting hosts for food, habitat and dispersal.<br>  Although the concept of parasitism applies unambiguously to many cases in nature, it is best considered part of a continuum of types of interactions between species, rather than an exclusive category. Particular interactions between species may satisfy some but not all parts of the definition. In many cases, it is difficult to demonstrate that the host is harmed. In others, there may be no apparent specialization on the part of the parasite, or the interaction between the organisms may be short-lived. In medicine, only eukaryotic organisms are considered parasites, with the exclusion of bacteria and viruses. Some branches of biology, however, regard members of these groups as parasitic<br>  Answer #3  HIV / AIDS

SIhxrxD3aa	Vet school is very very expensive.  After completing your undergraduate work vet school tuition costs an average of $18,000/year in-state and it's continuing to go up.  Out-of state tuition is twice as much and averages about $35,000/year.    For that reason it's very important to try to go to vet school in your state.  There are only 28 in the country and they are all good so try to stay in-state if you can.  It's also easier to be admitted in-state because each school has a specific number of seats set aside for residents and you'll be competing with fewer people.    It takes 6-8 years total to finish your education after high school.  You'll need 2-4 years of undergraduate work and 4 years of vet school.  Each vet school has a list of courses you must take before you apply.  These typically take about 2 years.  However, because vet school admissions are so competitive 90% of accepted students have bachelor's degrees.    The average starting salary for a vet is about $60,000/year.  The average overall is $100,000.  If you specialize or own your own practice you could make as much as $200,000.|`|q0vKbocHaa	-ALOT of money, You have to go to college FIRST before even thinking about veterinary school    - 60k-80k a year    - 8+ years (if you count internship)

Second, you can talk with your teacher if you want, but if you know there are quizzes and that the quizzes are harder than the tests, maybe the answer is for your to study harder and more regularly.

Reason being, it's an entry level profession which means that although the material may seem difficult in the beginning, you will quickly develop an understanding of it because all of the subjects contained in the study of Radiography are directly related to one another.Then once you've completed the course and have successfully completed the registry you can be cross trained for other modalities like computed tomography, MRI, or even MAMMO, which are all in high demand and offer competitive salaries. Especially Mammo techs, They are offering grads $45/hr right out school. Whereas Radiation Therapy is not in demand. Nuclear Medicine may be to great a challenge for someone who has not been in school for awhile and takes longer to complete if you decide to go directly into nuclear medicine without first completing general radiography. Whatever institution you choose to attend just make certain that they are Accredited, preferably by the Joint Review Commitee on Education in Radiologic Technology(JRCERT) To find the average salary for the profession searh www.salarywizard.com and enter you geographics and the site will provide you with the most current information.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|0GESLKdcaa	Online Degree-<br>  <a href="http://degreeus.info/" rel="nofollow">http://degreeus.info/</a>

yGOmMQP7aa	It depends if that 2400 that was quoted to you was for the year or the semester.  From what you said, it sounds like it's the YEAR.  Meaning you would have gotten half (1,200) last fall.  Leaving you another 1,200 for the spring.  Now, the 1,200 is assuming you were going to be a full time student (12 hours or more).      If you are NOT, you would probably not get this much money.  You would have to contact your school to be sure, but the money is sent directly to the school to pay for your tuition and fees and if you have any left over the remainder is given to you.  How you get it depends on the school.  Some will direct deposit it into your bank account, others mail checks, others will let you go pick the check up.    You pick up your check in the Bursars office if they do paper checks.  Or you can call financial aid and ask them when you will be getting it.

The Jesuits are the largest male religious order in the Catholic Church and are highly regarded for their intellectual capabilities.  Georgetown is famous for its School of Foreign Service and it has a spectacular location on the banks of the Potomac River in Washington, DC.  They have a great basketball team and a highly ranked undergraduate business school and a highly ranked law school. Nearly half of the student body in not Catholic but they do try to foster the spiritual development of students and provide a broad education in the liberal arts.

Id4OLpIZaa	Criminal Justice is okay, but I think it would be better if you specialize in something. Instead of Criminal Justice, you could major in accounting or perhaps psychology. There are detectives for all kind of things. For example, you could use your accounting skills to perhaps track the criminal finance and catch those committing money crimes or use it to find where criminals are hiding.  Or with a psychology degree, you may be able to predict the criminals next move, or where a crime is likely to take place or the motives of the criminal and why they act such a way.   Or you could be a computer geek (Computer engineers or other related field in computers) and track cyber crime. Cyber Crime I believe may be the future.     What I'm trying to say is that you could major in anything you want. Make sure you be a police officer first because you will not be hired as a detective right away unless you have connection or a special skill that no one else have.|`|43rgOMSCaa	Criminal Justice|`|JRB3t8staa	I'd say Criminology.

7EnnAVryaa	During reevaluation, they only re-total ur marks, without actually checking whether a particular question has been checked or not...<br>  <br>  The chances of an error are less in a board examination. But u see, mistakes do happen... and u will not even know if one happens...<br>  But generally, checking is done in 3 steps and hence chances of an error are minimized.  First, ur paper will be evaluated and each question will be awarded marks. Then, another examiner will check whether whole of the paper has been checked or not and will total ur score. Finally, a checker will check ur total. So, u can be rest assured that most probably ur paper will be evaluated correctly.<br>  <br>  So stop worrying about the checking and give the exams ur best shot... Your hard work will definitely pay off... :) <br>  Good luck!
qh9sBW0vaa	I would point out that people with a college education make (on average) at least 2-3 million dollars more over their lifetime. This allows for medical insurance and better housing, etc.   Education in this economy is crucial to securing a job that will provide lasting benefits and job security. There are plenty of people willing to do manual labor, but having an educated mind is fairly valuable in a competitive job market. It also enables you to "think outside the box" when trying to find jobs.    College provides great networking and friendships in addition to education. There is a lot of financial aid available to people who need it and the loans are easy to pay off over time (I have student loans and they didn't affect my mortgage/credit score when trying to find a house).

Ftkr9jqYaa	The best antonym to epiphenomenalism is HYPOPHENOMENALISM.  Of the two types of hypophenomenalism:  cosmological hypophenomenalism and biological hypophenomenalism, biological hypophenomenalism is closest to the modern anti-epiphenomenalistic view.    Another antonym of epiphenomenalism is CONSCIOUS NEUROFEEDBACK (Thomas Henry Huxley, 1874).    Epiphenomenalism is the doctrine that consciousness is merely an epiphenomenon of physiological processes, and that it has no power to affect these processes.     Biological hypophenomenalism, on the other hand, contends that life is a product, effect, or manifestation of psychic activity, and more particularly of conation (i.e., the part of mental life having to do with striving, including desire and volition).

A web of lies... "? Well, when you tel a lie, you need to remember that story. If you tell another lie, you have to stay with that story, you can't alter it. And it goes on,and on.    7 - Everyone thinks too much about their future, that they miss what is going on in the moment they're living. They are so concentrated on having a good future, they study too much. Or, they're focused on having their 'dream future', and don't do any work, so that when the future arrives, it's not near what they'd expected.

b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Yea that is an appropriate age to be teaching general european history - of which WWII and the holocaust are both undeniably huge components of.    It's important to teach due to the human collective effort to prevent genocide as a political decision. Obviously it is a medevil practice that has no place in this emerging new civilization growing around us.    13 years is old enough to be an adult in some cultures for good reason. People begin to realize their independence and shed that childhood innocence that you might be protecting by sugar coating history for them.     I say - if it is topic relevant go for it.

In fact, it's merely one out of many genocides to be attempted.  After high school I often wondered why we dwell on the Holocaust so much, but when it comes to the genocide of Africans, Eastern Europeans, etc. we tend to pass it right over.  If you're going to do a whole unit on the Holocaust, figure out why it is that you're doing so.  If it's to make your students more globally-aware, then why not mention the dozens of other genocides (some going on AS WE SPEAK).

Put a "one" at the end of the series, but write the numbers in a circle so they are all in sequence no matter where you start, for example: 5678901234.  Can't guarantee that's the answer, but, if we're thinking outside the box, I don't think there's one right answer; the problem is more an insight into your ability to think . . . outside the box.

eJlgaI3qaa	Revision for most people is all about using your short term memory to maximum effect, in otherwords leave it to a few days before the exam and then cram as much reading as you can take and hope your brain remembers what you read a day or so earlier. This is when people start to design really colourful and elaborate revision charts - not because this is going to help them much but because they are so bored with doing revision and scared about the exam that they want something to take their mind of it - lols. I've been there and done it.    As to how you should revise and when to start I would say today. Start as soon as you can and this is the reason why. When you learn something new you remember it well for a few hours and then your memory starts to fade until after a few days 50% of it is gone and a month later you will be lucky to remember very much at all. Now imagine you learn 10 key dates or facts in a subject. How many dates or facts can you remember in a class from a month ago? Not many. But what if you wrote them down on a card and every other day tested yourself, and if you can't remember you can peek at the card? You will keep these facts in your head for much longer. But that is only half the story. If you can remember key facts you will also remember other things associated with those key facts better as well and the more you do this the better you become at remembering the whole subject. You will surprise yourself how well you do - you are not a genius by doing this, you are just helping your memory.     Remember that you do not need to revise every word you read - just note down the key facts and a few other points linked to them, like a mind map, which is a key fact written down and other facts linked to them - google or yahoo mind map to see what I mean.    It all depends on how well you want to do - you can't do too well and you will not remember everything (unless you are a genius!) but it will take a few weeks to get your technique right so practice the above now and see how it works.    If all goes wrong and do nothing for a few months, if you are really really dedicated I think a month of really hard study could do it but believe me (I have been there) you will end up making lots of nice timetables for yourself....    Good luck!|`|PYkKz8qDaa	I wouldn't start revising as such now, but you could start planning your revision.     Like start writing the topics you think you'll need to revise and get the notes together, see if you can get some past exam papers and things like that and make a timetable.     Also could start thinking about getting together notes or something for the work you did in year 10.    Everyone has their own way of making timetables and as you do it you'll find something that works for you. A starting point would maybe be seeing when your exams are and working back. What milestones do you want to reach by certain dates.     This may help http://www.myrevisionplan.co.uk/info/abo...    Good Luck.|`|23fftRSsaa	what

Atticus would get about 2 miles of walking in a day going to & from twice a day.  It was on the southside of the town square just around the corner from the Maycomb Bank building where Atticus had his office.  All of this is in Chapt 15 where the kids head to the jail where Atticus is on watch of Tom and the Old Sarum crowd shows up knowing that Sheriff tate is out on a "Snipe Hunt". Now are all editions the same... don't know... but my my copy (40th Anniversary ed. 1999), this starts on p.170.  Now even when the crowd shows up for court and Lee goes into the Dolphus Raymond and the Idler's Club scene the courthouse doesn't get an address, but just a description.
HB8uby7xaa	The best way is to prepare at least an outline for each exam question that includes bullet points of key ideas.  You could also write out full answers, but it is probably going to be easier to remember the key content you want to include in your answers if you prepare by making an outline and then studying it.  Best of luck!

6f89ce25c7f475a60bd152b771651116aa	Bringing up your GPA from a 3.24 to a 3.40 is completely possible. However, I don't have much information to determine the difficulty. It depends on a range of factors from the difficulty of the classes, the grading scale and/or weight for each class, the number of hours you take, and the amount of work you are willing to put into studying.
RAxSichXaa	a.  distance = velocity x time       velocity = acceleration times time       therefore,  d=at2     where a is gravitational constant 9.81 m/sec2    In  2.8 seconds the ball would fall  9.81(2.8)2 = 76.9 m.  But the tower is only 57 m high so the ball would only fall 57m and hit the ground. Sneaky question?    b.  d=at2 ,   2.3 =(9.81) t2,    t = sqrt(2.3/9.81) = .484 sec         v = at = 9.81x.484 = 4.75 m/sec

91fa3af0bba2f3cc16e14a5da8807802aa	I'm doing it right now by answering your question...  It's a conspiracy! A Rotfang conspiracy! The world is being brought to its knees by forced constipation, procrastination and gum disease!  Anyhoo, do what I don't do.  Keep off the internet and make a very rigid schedule with a bunch of charts that make you feel like you're doing things when you actually do things.  Instead of like now.  The opposite of that.  Where I know I'm not doing anything. But I'm doing/notdoing that anyway.  If I had a schedule with various boxes in which to tick and check, I'd be getting things done.|`|oHL8qA42aa	make a to do list|`|gBPUmn8Xaa	Well you could make a schedule like:    1.

1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	You send college applications out in the fall of senior year, so you have one semester left to raise your GPA.  If you took the same number of classes every semester and get all A's from now on, your highest possible GPA is (1.83 * 5 + 4.0 * 1) / 6 = 2.19 GPA.  However, that seems pretty unlikely given your grades.  Think about this - why do you want to go to college?  You're obviously struggling in high school, and those aren't passing grades in college - and college expects a lot more from you than high school.  You'd have to start in community college; no 4-year college worth attending would take you with a 2.2 GPA.  But there are many other paths you can take besides college.|`|30mOLgWJaa	I agree with the other commenter. Go to the local community college and get information from them. You need to work harder or get some tutors helping you to get your grades up. If you get an Associates Degree at a local community college it will transfer to a 4 year university and you will be on your way.    Work hard and get ahead! Good luck to you!

We don't know why you had to leave us, Nan, but we miss you terribly. Capella has never been the same since you left. Please keep the students of Capella in your thoughts and prayers, going through terrible times right now. Lots of harrassment, discrimination and disenrollment going on that Dr. Nan would never have allowed on her watch!|`|30mOLgWJaa	This is easy.

8ekoa6szaa	As soon as it was built.

You see, a washing machine spins your clothes, causing your clothes to rub on one another and thus, washing it. It also spins your clothes at a high speed to squeeze all the excess water out before you stick it in a dryer. A dishwasher doesn't do all this. It also doesn't spin your clothes around while drying. Which means your clothes won't be evenly dried.

AA11604732	Each university has its own rules.    Most gowns for a BS or BA are black.  The cap is usually a black mortarboard (all degrees except the PhD usually wear a mortarboard -- PhDs can wear a tam).  Many universities have a hood for bachelor's degrees.  These are smaller than master's hoods, which are, in turn, smaller than the doctoral hood.    The hood is usually black on the outside, with a trim that represents the degree.  The trim is Gold for a degree in science, white for a degree in the liberal arts, green for law, tan for business (commerce to you), and scarlet for theology.  The inside of the hood usually displays the school colors of the university.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	Gosh - when I graduated in 1976    it was a yellow band round the hood, but it may have changed    Also, does it vary in different Uni's..I'm not sure|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	In the U.S., pharmacy wears an olive green hood.|`|rRQNDpwVaa	Different universities have different colours.

NTx0deaJaa	I think a lot of people would argue for stem cell research rather than making organ donation mandatory. Just a thought. Todays age is rather heavy on research and development and I think majority of society would rather fund research and technological advances than making donation mandatory. In all actuality, donation for everybody is not really possible for various health reasons, life choices, genetics, etc. You should look into how many people decide to donate on their licenses and those that choose not to. I think you would be surprised by how many people say no.It is not a very popular idea, and I think there would be an uproar from society. These are just a few thoughts, and very random. I hope it gives you a starting point.|`|t2059Apeaa	What's the point of mandatory if you can opt out?  The controversy, as I see it, is the government mandating such a personal choice as organ donation.  At this time, we have an "opt in" policy as it were; you can put it on your driver's license.  I suppose if one were in a position where they became an organ donor, ie: dead, it wouldn't really matter to them, but the thought of the government assuming control over our dead bodies is something that will happen only . . . over my dead body.|`|uvWjy8Aeaa	I find it quite controversial.

O87ad1wYaa	"How do you like them apples?", also shortened to, "How do you like them?" or, "Them apples", phrase invented by A.

a551eeb1cb550b393e8d6b43a5e6f34eaa	All of Lewis's Chronicles of Narnia books are told in third-person omniscient. This allows him to alternate from one character's point of view to another, as well as step back occasionally in order to make comments. It's been awhile since I've read the series, but I believe he even refers every now and then to you, the reader.     Lewis was a genius and an artist. Compare 'The Screwtape Letters' to 'Chronicles of Narnia', and you'll see. If you read any of his other fiction, you'll find he employs a variety of techniques. In 'The Great Divorce' he even breaks the fourth barrier and refers to himself, the author. His favorite though is third-person omniscient.       Note:***  It is not told in the third-person. It is told in the third-person omniscient. A story told 'mainly' in a third person point of view, its not a story told COMPLETELY in a third person point of view. Any deviation from a third person point of view no matter how small, marks it as omniscient. Most fiction today is told in omniscient mode.

066a3072b2a697635921e0eb4d7507ddaa	The capital markets comprise the debt and equity markets. The capital markets are so called as they trade in financial instruments issued to raise capital.    The debt capital market trades in instruments, such as bonds and loans, which pay interest. The debt capital market is also known as the fixed income market. Debt instruments with maturities of 12 months or less are traded in the money markets.     Debt instruments include bonds issued by governments, government-backed agencies and companies to raise capital to cover their spending requirements. The debt capital market also trades in derivative instruments, the commonest of which are futures, options and swaps.    Professionals in the global debt capital market need access to a wide range of information to perform effectively. Because they have to monitor the market while keeping abreast of the events that affect it, they look for information services that combine real-time market data with fast, reliable news coverage. And because so many factors influence the debt capital market, they need economic, political, general and company news from around the world as well as market news.    They also need descriptive information on bonds - from pricing, terms and conditions, and credit ratings data to information on issuers. Corporate bond specialists, additionally, need access to company information including fundamental data, estimates of future financial performance and research analysis.    In addition to information, debt capital market professionals require powerful, purpose-built analysis tools to help them evaluate and compare instruments. They also need the ability to communicate quickly with colleagues and customers, and functionality that enables them to trade easily with leading participants in the global debt capital market.|`|f63ba71f316e8a0101a83d2986ff5c54aa	every countries debt, due to banks greed.|`|HoqbrYYxaa	Barack Obama is the prob! watch KUDLOW, hes my life!!!

9HTtnl43aa	if you want to learn a new language fluently, you really need a certain amount of practice with native speakers of that language. you can get a foundation by studying grammatical rules and vocabulary, but you need to hear the spoken language and put yourself in a position where you have to speak on cue and also get your ear attuned to the sounds of the language as it is spoken naturally.     i have spent a lot of time in ecuador and with spanish people in the states which has helped a lot in this regard.    if you cannot find native speakers to practice with, try googling "learn spanish" or whatever language you want to learn. there are a lot of free programs out there that offer dialogs to listen to and grammar and vocabulary sites.    i would check out as many as these as possible before investing in rosetta stone, which i agree is very expensive.    another great resource is the tremendous amount of language courses offered for free as pod casts.|`|BKmQaNzqaa	Rosetta Stone is highly-acclaimed, very expensive though. They offer a wide range of languages. Also, at your school, they should offer some courses. There are usually tutors in the area; if you know anyone who can speak the language of your choice, ask if they're willing to tutor you. I know the CTY program offers language courses, but you need to qualify in order to take the test in order to be able to take the courses. Additionally, Keystone National High School online offers courses (and no, you don't have to be in high school).|`|fmaxc3K3aa	The best way to learn a new language fast is spend time in a country that speaks that language.

With a grade C or fail you might end up going to a good University.    Best you can do is go to your teacher and see if he can allow you extra credit work to raise your grade.|`|EvRIwz4Laa	First of all before I say anything else, you may want to get your parents involved. I am not certian that your school can not allow you to get into a lower level. It may not be desirable but maybe with some parental pushing the administration will give in.     OK, this is not to be mean but you know it has to be said, YOU HAVE TO GET WITH THE PROGRAM! If you really care about getting a good grade then you have to do the homework and study for the tests. There is no easy way around that, and you know this if you have been doing well all along. Are you already admitted? Hopefully so, and even then I would hate for you to lose money b/c of senioritus and colleges will not look kindly upon that type of performance especially if you have been doing so well all along. Other than studying you should go talk to your teacher. Explain to him everything and tell him you are willing to do whatever it takes (and do not be lying ;) ) He may say your SOL or he may give you some extra credit to make up what you have performed poorly on thus far. Also, try getting a study group together, maybe if you are hanging out with friends and doing economics at the same time then you will be more inclined to study some? I know that being a senior for most including myself equals being lazy (I have been there twice) but dude you have worked too hard for too long to not graduate because you could not get it together.|`|PqcEjB0Oaa	It sounds like you need some time off to relax.

abc10c081ca55f358d27b9acde1ea0b7aa	"Same-sex marriages may be a positive influence on society."    "Ludarous" is not a word.  Do you mean "ludicrous"?    There will never be an end to discrimination against gays, just as there will never be an end to discrimination against other races or religions.    Same-sex marriages will not be a profit-factor for the wedding industry unless a wedding consultant only works on gay marriages.    Religion is the biggest factor against gay marriage.  Calling a union of two gay people "marriage" is a big hang-up for many people.  "Marriage" is really a religious term that has come into common usage.  "Civil unions" confer the same legal status as marriage, but the religious folk won't accept using "marriage" for that state and the gays won't accept using "civil union" instead of "marriage".    The whole problem is one of semantics.  The religious folks think they own the term "marriage".

Know that if the school you choose is not right for your daughter, you can always change. Lots of people do.

I consider it inappropriate when someone answers your question with a question however I will answer a question with a question if i feel that the person is being a smart bum with their question.     Does that make sense?|`|mFf8CqAraa	I question their inability to be more original.

F38rqV07aa	They should only be capitalized if used as a proper noun (i.e. as a name), like for a class. For example Biology 101, Chemistry 100, etc.    So, the following would be correct:    I am studying biology. (not a proper noun)  I am taking Biology. (a proper noun if you are referring to a particular class)    In the first case, you are referring to a generic field of study. In the latter you are talking about a specific class. It is basically the same rule as the one for "mom."    I am talking to my mom. (not a proper noun)  I am talking to Mom. (a proper noun)    Same scenario.|`|RdVaoHztaa	You should only capitalize them if you feel like it.

Hope this helps, and good luck on the mid-terms!|`|974f0b5b6385aa54a25619cd68541a47aa	I always have that trouble when I'm trying to study at home. So what I do is get my laptop, and things I need and head off to the Uni library, where I can't get disturbed, and I'm surrounded by other hardworking students, it makes you WANT to study.  If I'm at home, I want to watch telly, or I keep making drinks, or find myself cleaning when I wouldn't normally, just to get out of studying!  So yeah, I know how you feel. I don't know how long left you've got of your studies, but you got to think, after your studies are over, you've got the rest of your life to watch movies, play games, go out partying, etc - - concentrate on these last few years, get yourself a good grade, it's for life!

Second, if your teacher wants MLA style, then you need to buy an MLA citation manual. Go to Borders or Barnes and Noble to find the proper book on citation for MLA. I am in college too and I had to buy a manual for proper citation purposes. Once you have the book, it will explain how to properly format your citations. As for your assignment, that is something you will have to do, as I do not use MLA format. Good luck.
yGOmMQP7aa	You need to understand the difference in the fafsa deadline, your state deadline, and the schools "priority" deadline.    1. You are correct.  "On the day you file" is what they are wanting for your marriage.  So if you file on July 12th, you would be classified as independent and would not need your parents income.  You would list yours AND your new husband's income from 2008.  Even though you weren't married in 2008, both of your income still has to be listed.  Also note: if you did your fafsa tomorrow and weren't married, you CAN NOT go back and change it to "married" later.  Because it's the date you signed the fafsa.    2.  It is NOT true you will not get grants if  you file after March 1st.  The federal grant, the Pell does not "run out".  IF you qualify for the Pell (based on yours and hubby's income) you would get it if you filed on June 30th, or if you filed on March 2 (with your and your parents income) or even before.  Again, because the Pell doesn't "run out".   It is in  your best interest to file as soon as you know you are going to go to school (because you want that money to pay for your tuition).  But if you pay out of pocket, and file later in the semester or year, the school will give you your grant and/or loan money if you don't have an outstanding balance with them.     3.  State grants however, are a different story, your state will post a priority deadline. This money does run out and priority is given to those who qualify and apply first.  Sometimes people will get the grant when they file AFTER the deadline, but it depends on how much money the state has to give out and how many apply.  Once that money runs out, you would have to wait until next year to try to make the priority deadline that time.    4.  Your schools March 2nd deadline is another "priority" deadline to give everyone enough time to get the aid processed so you'll have your money when school starts in August.  Scholarships are also given out on a yearly basis, so those who apply then will get priority for those who apply later.  Just remember, lots of people start school in January, and they also aren't held to those strict deadlines, those folks just never get in the "application pool" for state or institutional or state money.    Now, the good news to all this is you WILL get aid for filing on July 12th.  The BAD news is, it may not be processed in time before your classes start in August.  Some schools are faster than others, and some schools are a bit more tolerant of you having outstanding balances for tuition, and will sign you up for a payment plan ect.  Others are not - and will drop your classes for non payment a few days before school starts!!    Also, many folks get all excited about not having to report the folks income and think they are automatically going to get the Pell grant, but this is not always the case.  You will be offered federal Stafford loans for sure, but don't get your hopes up too high.  It is very difficult for a married couple with no kids to qualify for grants if both of them have full time jobs.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Fill out your school FASFA anyways to meet the school deadline. You can go back and change the info after you get married.     ss
wU2SvL6Qaa	definitely option 1, i took chemistry and physics in two separate years and it would have been so much better to have taken them together..and also depending on what you want to be, if you want to be a pharmacist or anything of the sort then you should go with the AP Chem.|`|8X4Lxteeaa	if i had to pick one myself, i'd go with AP advanced chemistry   :)|`|rpU209Xfaa	the first sounds funner!  i'm a junior now!|`|Yw2Ynm0Daa	if you want to get into big rep schools then go for option 2|`|f57L7TKRaa	Go with Physics. A basic understanding of physics really helps you grasp everyday problems with greater ease, and it is just a practical application of math, which makes the otherwise tedious subject more fun!|`|CmNTc1aSaa	Hey, I'm going to be a junior, too, and I'm in the same type of situation, picking next year's classes.  You really have a lot of great choices, and I don't think you can go wrong taking one or the other.  I don't totally understand the block system of scheduling, because it's not done at my school that way, but I would try to work in some kind of Chemistry and Physics before graduation.  I would take IB Physics SL, though.

U9bQgfY9aa	Other than a select few schools like Harvard, Yale and Stanford the employers do not care what school someone went to and only in a few subjects. When we hire engineers we want to know what the person did and that they graduated from an accredited school. But the ranking some magazine gave the school, based on a survey of students does not matter to us in the slightest.    If Drake is your first choice, go for it. And Number 51 is still pretty good as I think there are something like 20,000 degree granting post secondary schools in the USA.|`|JRKJ1w3Zaa	those rankins seem pretty darn good...    it would be best to go to the smaller college.    go to the school that you have your heart set on.|`|7ab916140739d43fdaf1975e036f6b98aa	You should pick a school near where you want to practice.

rqk1ul5Taa	I'm not sure if you can get a BA for a specific musical instrument. You can apply to a music program, where you'll audition with your principal instrument, but I don't think you can get "a BA in piano".    Composing, I'm not sure about either, although I haven't looked into that (I have no talent for compositions XD) so I could be very wrong.    As for income...it can be hard to make a good living off of music. You'd either have to be a teacher, or you'd have to be a really damn good musician to be able to get into a symphony orchestra or something like that. I imagine that composing is similar. You need to be either very very good, or very very lucky, in order to make a lot of money off of it.

You can write a journal that starts w/ the topic and then tell what it means, who will rogers was, other quotes he wrote, etc.     William Penn Adair Will Rogers (November 4, 1879  August 15, 1935) was a Cherokee-American cowboy, comedian, humorist, social commentator, vaudeville performer and actor. He was the father of U.S. Congressman and WWII Veteran Will Rogers, Jr.    Known as Oklahoma's favorite son,[1] Rogers was born to a prominent Indian Territory family and learned to ride horses and use a lariat so well that he was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for throwing three ropes at onceone around the neck of a horse, another around the horse's rider, and a third around all four legs of the horse[citation needed]. He ultimately traveled around the world three times, made 71 movies (50 silent films and 21 "talkies"),[2] wrote more than 4,000 nationally-syndicated newspaper columns,[3] and became a world-famous figure.    By the mid-1930s, Rogers was adored by the American people, and was the top-paid movie star in Hollywood at the time. Rogers died in 1935 while on an around-the-world trip with aviator Wiley Post, when their small airplane crashed near Barrow, Alaska Territory.    haha wikipedia is handy!    n e ways, GL!|`|eH0LzPYpaa	I think that it means everyone is ignorant just on different subjects.

But, a certain level of maturity is reached while you're in school. (Some more than others.) You learn to think in different ways, and are exposed to a variety of people. School is there to exercise areas of your brain that you wouldn't normally use, to get them to develop correctly. And, if you want a more concrete answer, we go to school because everybody else does. An employer will take an educated person over an uneducated person any day, no matter how well the uneducated person performs the job. Degrees look nice.

lbR1IoiSaa	If you're going to a traditional college/ university, you do not need to pay so much attention at this time, to what you want to do when you're done, because most of the first two years of your education are what are called "core courses" - or general education courses that most everyone has to take before you get into the "meat" and "major area" of your degree program.     The key to success and happiness in work:  don't do what has more opportunities, but rather do DO what will make you happy day in and day out :).      Talk to an academic counselor or enrollment counselor and ask them what general ed credits you could take to help you get an idea of each of the areas you're interested in.  Sometimes they try to place all of the "history" students in one particular section, sometimes they mix it all up.  Ask what their process is, and also ask by when you need to declare your major (identify it and confirm with the college that that is the track you want to be on).  Most 4 yr colleges / universities require you to 'declare' your major by Junior year.  You'll just be an 'undeclared' student until then - and that will give you time to figure it out after you've gotten a 'taste' of college level courses.     Ask questions, loads of them, and ask if you could talk to any of their current students in the fields you're interested in, for an idea and another student perspective - if they're a good college, they have students that are selected for 'mentorships', or for just being a resource to a 'newbie'.      Good luck, you'll figure it out, just don't be in a rush!  I was 12 credits away from my Bachelors before i finally realized I didn't want to do that for the rest of my life - it cost me an extra year and a 1/2 to change course and earn my Bachelors in what I should've done in the first place.  I should have done more investigation and not been in a hurry to 'declare' my major :P.|`|AaODSawMaa	Well, each of those major carries it's own potential. What you should do is take a class in each this semester and weigh them against each other to see which you prefer. It's not important to know what your exact major is when you start as long as you take classes that will eventually fulfill general education requirements even if you decide not to major in that. It's really going to be up to you in the end, but until you know what you'll actually enjoy learning more about, you can't truly decide. And you can't actually understand any of those studies without some experience in each. Hope that helps.|`|9Pwo4nD8aa	U should study wateva u want 2 put ur mind 2. It's ur opinion.

He is almost limited to being a teacher with a degree in history.  There just aren't many choices with a history degree. Picking a major is a tough choice.  During your freshman year of college you can choose "undeclared" or "undecided" until you figure out what you really want.  Don't pick something just to pick it.  I went my whole freshman year without a major.  I'm now a junior majoring in Management.  Remember- this is what you're going to do the rest of your life.

There are conferences every week at universities all over the country (and world). Usually they're smallish events put on by an individual department around a theme. There are also huge annual ones put on by large professional organizations, but these are also broken down into panels organized by theme. They'll ask for a one-page abstract describing what you want to talk about, and they'll choose the most interesting among them to invite. <br>  <br>  For your first conference, I would choose one that's aimed at graduate students or even undergrads (if you can find one) rather than one where faculty are also presenting.<br>  <br>  Paper talks are usually expected to be 15-20 minutes, or about 7-10 double-spaced pages. It's fine to read from a written paper--most people do--or you can talk from an outline or notes if you prefer.<br>  <br>  Finally, I wouldn't worry too much if you don't manage to present at any conferences before applying to grad school. It's a big bonus, but it's not necessarily expected or required as an undergraduate.<br>  <br>  Edited to add: ask your prof or the secretary of your department to forward you announcements of calls for papers. Usually these are advertised to departments and sent along to faculty and grad students, but not undergrads.|`|0GESLKdcaa	Online Degree-<br>  <a href="http://degreeus.info/" rel="nofollow">http://degreeus.info/</a>

AA10407542	I am going to give you advice that you probably dont want to hear.  Go to your local college and obtain the services, for free, to start a sound business plan.  You need to treat this like a business because there will be a lot of children and families relying on you when you get this started.  The buss. plan will give you a good look at what money you will bring in and what is going out.  Do you have the funds to operate a quality program?  Will you be compliant with your local licensing agency?  Im saying this so that you take the "dirty stuff" into account at the onset along with the above mentioned items.<br>  <br>  You would not have to spend much to get a pretty decent art area started.  For an in-home center with less than 10 children you could get started for less than $50.  Have scrap items in containers for collage and child directed projects.  Put your markers, cap down, in some plaster of Paris so that the tops dont get lost and they last longer. Thin out your paints, purchase off brand crayons  etc etc.  As far as the storage items..... It would cost more to ship these items to you than it would be to buy them, or have them built.  I would talk to home depot or Lowe's and see if they have any "scratch and dent" items that could be used for this.  Dont you have closets in your house?  Well, just get some plywood, brackets, and beg a buddy to spend a few hours on this. Having items in the closet also gives them a "home" for safety and accountability.<br>  <br>  I dont have much to say about the toys other than that these will need to be acquired rather than built.  If this is really what you want to do, you need to get out there and make it happen.  This will inspire you and give you more ownership with the facility.  I encourage you to get a plan in place so that this has a good foundation for it.  I see many programs fail due to the fact that caregivers assume that by just caring enough, all will work out.  Unfortunately, this is not the case.  <br>  If you want to write me back, you can.  I might be able to point you in a particular direction....Best of luck on this!|`|df7eb800ff0d3d2aec218aae79b6f9cfaa	Try FreeCycle.com and Craigslist for free items.

French toast-     your choices really are endless as most things can be frozen/reheated.|`|JOXQrsw0aa	If you can boil water then you can cook healthy whole grain  pasta and top it with pasta sauce from a jar. Just drain the water and put the sauce in the pot and stir it up. The hot pasta will warm the sauce. Vacuum packed whole wheat gnocchi are another alternative. You can also cut up and boil vegetables like broccoli, squash, zucchini, carrots and top them with either pasta sauce or a combination of soy sauce and sesame oil and maybe a dash of tabasco sauce. Potatoes will cook quickly in boiling water if sliced thinly. Cook them with other sliced vegetables. They also taste good  topped with pasta sauce or soy sauce, sesame oil and tabasco.  S&W canned San Antonio Recipe beans, Santa Fe Recipe Beans and Caribbean Recipe Beans are like a meal in and of themselves and very healthy and much more filling than soup. Same with Heinz Vegeterian Beans in Rich Tomato Sauce.  Extra Firm Tofu tastes great cut up into small cubes and served cold with soy sauce and sesame oil.  It can also be sauteed in sesame oil in a few minutes. If you are near a Trader Joe's, the Spinach Pizza and the Pesto Pizza are healthy and not too much fat if only half the pizza is eaten. I cut the frozen pizza in half  and cook one half and return the other to the freezer.  Sandwiches are easy to make.  Use whole grain bread high in fiber. I  like whole grain pita bread  stuffed with favorite ingredients: sliced tomato, cucumber, avocado, orange, yellow and red bell pepper, olives, almonds, Trader Joe's no fat feta  etc and flavored with favorite condiments. Different mustards, soy sauce and sesame oil.  Good Luck!

I would think your teachers would appreciate you in their classroom as you do not create any problems for them.      Contrary to what most people think, an introvert is not simply a person who is shy. In fact, being shy has little to do with being an introvert! Shyness has an element of apprehension, nervousness and anxiety, and while an introvert may also be shy, introversion itself is not shyness. Basically, an introvert is a person who is energized by being alone and whose energy is drained by being around other people.    Introverts are more concerned with the inner world of the mind. They enjoy thinking, exploring their thoughts and feelings. They often avoid social situations because being around people drains their energy. This is true even if they have good social skills. After being with people for any length of time, such as at a party, they need time alone to "recharge."|`|79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	I'd call you an introvert. An isolated person has kind of a negative connotation, don't you think?    And generally, teachers have a better liking to those who participate in class, but as long as you're nice to them and try to be positive, it's not bad at all. They would rather quiet students than disruptive ones, though.    Usually a teacher points out in the first day of class if they grade for class participation. It's only a few points though, so if you're a good enough student, it can hardly hurt at all. It just depends on the teacher.|`|xTMnDTzfaa	It's really good that you study hard and do your homework on time. Actually, you're supposed to be doing that, and you'd be a bad student if you didn't.    The thing is, teachers love it when kids participate. It's how they get to know them, and usually, grades are partly based on class participation. It shows enthusiasm and intelligence. Teachers get to know and like the student who not only studies and does homework, but participates. And trust me, when you apply to college, you'll need a couple of teacher recommendations, which you likely won't get if you don't do class participation. Plus, the more you participate and get involved in class, the more exciting and interesting the class will get.    You're what's called an introvert, not an isolated person. Some teachers are indifferent to whether or not a student is shy, but other teachers look down on it.    Don't be afraid to contribute to class. The result can only be good. Good luck :)

You get a grant which is free money you don't have to pay it back or you can two different types of loans. Loans you do have to pay back starting 6 month after you graduate.     You could go see a fin aid counselor  at the school your trying to attend to clarify all your questions because some polices are different at each school.|`|10HZNCLZaa	For scholarship or financial aid questions, I point my friends to check out http://www.FinancialAidQuick.com and take a look around.Its great mini directory with several great sources of info.|`|mbSZpgw8aa	Does anyone know how school financial aids work?  * You apply for financial aid.  You will enter information about family income, family size, etc.  This is based on your tax returns from the previous year.  (Or your parents tax returns if you are a dependent)  This will give you your Expected Family Contribution (the amount they expect you or your family to pay for college)  Financial aid means - Grants (don't have to be paid back) and Loans (have to be paid back) which you qualify for.    Can people planning on going to a community college get financial aid?  Yes.  Look at the college website.  They should have financial aid info.     Does it pay for the entire thing?  It depends on your Expected Family Contribution.  Apply for scholarships.  Try www.fastweb.com  I go to Community college and between grants and scholarships, I don't pay a dime.     Or do you have to pay for classes & the financial aid will pay for your books?  Apply for financial aid as soon as possible.  If you have aid, most college financial aid offices will give you a book voucher if you have enough to cover tuition and books.  Do you eventually have to paid this money back? Depends on if it is a loan or a grant/scholarship.  See above.   Is there any programs that you don't have to pay back, or maybe not pay back the whole thing?  Grants and scholarships.     Where could I find good financial aids? You will fill out the federal financial aid form for state grants, etc.  But look into scholarships.  There are SO many.  Try fastweb.com and also your school (or potential schools) website.

d0Fmrywiaa	The numbers are the call numbers and they are based on the dewey decimal system.  The letters are indeed the author's last initial, and the numbers relate to subject matter.  Check this link <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dewey_Decimal_classes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dew...</a>  to see how the numbers relate to classes.  <br>  <br>  When you go into the library and are looking for a particular book, search either the card catalogue (if they still have one) or on the computer (or ask the librarian) they will give you a number for example if you get E 225.1, first go to the 200's section and find the general area and then look for the letter within that section. The shelves themselves should be numbered to make it easier.  If you have trouble, ask an employee, they've been asked that question many times, and shouldn't have a problem helping you (that's what they are there for).<br>  <br>  Get yourself a library card, bring the book to the desk and you're in business.|`|jrWpHYAPaa	dewey decimal system? and barcode?<br>  <br>  you need a library cataloge and paper and pencil.

Trinity will accept another language. It is best to keep your options open and to the language if you have a chance of going over there as an au pair or something, as it is such an easy and enjoyable way to pick it up. Otherwise cut your losses and concentrate on the old Irish.

695a1f35442f9b98085dcc4c83fbeddfaa	First things first in order to pursue medical school you have to get a bachelors degree which is when you go to four years of college and major in something like biology or psychology or whatever you want so long as you fill the requirements.  In your third year of college you will take a test called the MCAT kind of like the SATs of medical school.  Then in your senior year you will apply to medical schools.  Now medical schools are programs typically within a larger insitution or university.  Some examples of medical schools are Johns Hopkins, University of Maryland school of medicine, Mayo.  Applying to medical school is rigorous you have to have good grades, volunteering, and you need to be overall well rounded.  Once you are in medical school you will typically spend the first two years in a classroom.  The next two years you will spend in clinics and hospitals.  Once you graduate you will still need to do an internship and then residency.

Med schools are generally a part of a bigger university.  It might all be in one building, or the classes might be spread out in the university.  For the most part, classes in med school don't take place in a hospital.  However, I'm sure there is actual training work that needs to be done in a hospital before you graduate.      If you get accepted to med school (extremely hard to get into), you will likely stay in an apartment nearby or a grad student residence.

If you can't do that, for whatever reason - perhaps you didn't get the necessary grades or couldn't pass a class at all, then you can just teach physics.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	Kylee is right, although it's usually applied more to teachers in the arts than teachers in the sciences, at least at the college level - the most competitive jobs are for college professors in the sciences, where you're not only known for what you do but also for teaching.  Many of the top physicists in the world are at universities.|`|FmYkUfIDaa	My initial reaction to this statement is that it was coined by someone with a grudge against teachers, meaning anyone who taught any skill.    It really is a contradiction. Take - "Those who can't, teach."  If they 'can't' then how could they teach?    In life it appears that there are a body of mischievous people who generate these 'throw-away lines' to promote disharmony and generally upset people who are doing their best in society.    Recently whilst watching TV I heard a comment about someone who unthinkingly said something without considering the consequences.    This is what I heard:  "In future before you say anything, I suggest that you arrange to break off diplomatic relations between you brain and your mouth."    It is offensive to all teachers.

I love thee to the depth and breadth and height  My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  For the ends of Being and ideal Grace.  I love thee to the level of every day's  Most quiet need; by sun and candle-light.  I love thee freely, as men strive for Right;  I love thee purely, as they turn from Praise.  I love thee with the passion put to use  In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith  I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  With my lost saints,--I love thee with the breath.  Smiles, tears, of all my life!--and, if God choose,  I shall but love thee better after death. -Elizabeth Barrett Browning

EvRIwz4Laa	If you can it would look nice to take both AP bio and AP chem. Also if you score high enough on the AP test then you will not have to take the intro courses in college and you will get credit so you will be able to maybe get out a little early/ take other classes that interest you outside of your major. Can you fit both in? Maybe take one as a Junior and one as a Senior? It really should not matter when you take AP Chem. The only thing would be if you take it really early then you may have forgotten some of the principles and what not when you have to take it in college. However, if you do well in AP chem at any point you should be fine either way. As for AP English, it is always good to have as many AP classes as possible, as long as you can do well in all of them. If you over exert yourself and then do poorly that can look worse than if you do not take any at all. Also, since you already know what you want to major in maybe you could take both the AP science courses and take regular English? Or if you know you can handle it, you have 4 semesters, ask your high school if it is possible for you to take all 3. Good luck :)|`|kzbEWqgLaa	AP Biology..... matter fact do Anatomy & Physiology.... i'm not sure if AP chemistry would help much.... but i'm a junior going for the same major as you..

However, there is a group of exams called the CLEP (College Level Examination Program) which will allow you to take the test and receive credit without having to actually take a class.  If your life experience has given you sufficient knowledge to let you succeed on this exam, you can get a class worth of credit for it.  There are a number of subjects and some colleges will let you take more of the tests than others.    However, all legitimate colleges will require coursework and have certain educational standards you must meet.

U9bQgfY9aa	You do understand that these are degrees that do NOT lead to a job. To get a job in those fields you need to all the way to a doctorate.     Grads in those two fields make among the lowest average pay of all graduates and generally have long stretches after graduation working at Starbucks.    My daughter did a dual major in Economics and Political Science and that is turning out to be a great combination. She has already done some lobbying work. But even in her case, these were just a step to grad school and then a doctorate. She is in grad school now getting a dual major in Transportation Management and Safety.    And to get into either of thise two faculties at most schools, you only need to have regular high school graduation with maybe a GPA of 3.0 or higher. No special courses are needed. My daughter did not even take any AP courses as they were not offered as she did high school on independent study and over 200 colleges, even Harvard tried to recruit her.

Also, this is critical; explore the town and see if you can tolerate staying there through the best years of your life (assuming your in your 20's). Do you like a low volume of traffic, do you like the culture, is their too much or not enough racial diversity, is it close to a major airport or something else that will cultivate irritations and noise, etc.     That is wonderful that you have the privilege of exploring the school before you commit to it, as most people dont have the luxury of doing that.

N0Qw9Qdnaa	I can't tell if you're talking about an actual novel or something like an SAT preparation workbook.    One thing I can tell you is that I took it and got an 1840 the first time, than or English class did some heavy analysis on the book "The Catcher in the Rye" by Salinger (timeless classic).  I took the SAT again shortly after and scored a 2110 (it's out of 2400 in NC, i don't know about you're state).  It may just be a coincedence, but try reading that book and thinking about the concepts in it.  For all you know, it could actually help you.

AyN85doAaa	Firstly - well done you for wanting to do this! A lot of people would write off going to university altogether.    Lots of people go to university at a mature age - I know a fifty-something who's planning to get a law degree. There is nothing to be ashamed about. So the others might be younger, but you're wiser and have more life experience.    Besides, the important thing about uni is getting the education - don't worry about the other students. Even if some of them are awful to you, you didn't go to univeristy to make friends with them, did you? Just focus on the course instead of the younger students and how they make you feel. Mind you, a lot of young people get on brilliantly with older people - you might even make a lot of friends who'll see you as a mum-type and a comfort. Everyone else there will have insecurities as well. I am an eighteen-year-old student and sometimes I like to talk to people very much older than me, because I know they'll have good advice and kindness for me, as well as having stories and experience about things nobody my age has gotten to experience yet.    I guess it comes down to -do you really want this? Then do it. Life is too short to put off the things you want to do. Be brave and take the leap! You'll be glad you did. Think about how wonderful it's going to be when you graduate!|`|L7lr7jNEaa	Hiya, i am 29 mum of a 5 year old and a 5 month old and currently doing my 2nd year at uni, i had the same concerns about joining uni as you but once you are there its the opposite, other students are aware of the courage it takes to join uni as a mature student and have nothing but respect and admiration for those who do it, i have met other mature students through the mature student society and there are people from all ages, being 71 the oldest, uni is an amazing experience so dont let it slip away, im not a fashionable mum either and i've stil made very good friends at uni, all younger because at uni we are not mum of kat and harry but our own selves, join uni and enjoy the experience, i recommend it!|`|A5ZQmmW1aa	Just to add to what everyone else has said - no, of course you are not too old!  And to be honest, you might get more out of it. I notice that the mature students often seem to be the ones who enjoy class more and take a real interest in their subject.  This was definitely the case for me when I went back to university as a more mature person!!|`|kmaoNV01aa	No, you're not too old. If you have the motivation and the interest to pursue your studies in higher education, don't let anything stop you! I'm currently studying at university; I'm not a mature student but I frequently see ladies in their mid forties to mid fifties in my lectures. Don't worry about what other students think of you. Some will be polite and seek to make pleasant conversation with you, and others may not say anything. Also, even people who have come straight from school will notice that, at university, you're not obliged to be encircled with friends in order to fit in during lectures. There are many students who choose to sit by themselves in my lectures, not because they're outcasts, but because they like it that way. I can't speak for all universities but, at the one I attend, my lectures are only 50 minutes long anyway, so the main focus is getting the notes down and listening to what the lecturer says, rather than sussing out everybody else that's there. If you choose a subject that you're interested in, you should really enjoy the experience of studying at university. All the best to you. I hope everything works out well :)|`|b5iVHLoVaa	my mum went to uni to do a BA at 45- she loved it so much and made loads of friends here age on her course and went on to do an MA which she is finishing this summer.|`|1oGBByMIaa	i no some one thats 85years old he sitill goes to a univerity becuse he loves it!|`|1b40b411fde105efac034d33b5f3fdeeaa	NO!

Personally I respect mature students and think they're more likely to be passionate about their studies, and I think a lot of people feel the same way. Maybe you won't be "hip" at a party for 20 year olds where everyone gets wasted but that's not what university is about. I think you'll fit in just fine in the classroom.|`|7deb425958c53615415ce326bcbf08e0aa	go for it, there were a few mums on my course|`|AA12299134	Never too old, not at all.  When I was a student, there was a healthy community of mature students with ages ranging from late 20s to their early 50s.  They fitted in with the younger students and had a good social life (amongst themselves and with other people too) and younger people often sought them out because of their broader knowledge and life experience.  This also helped them with their work, their minds had a better understanding of the topics and they found it easier.  They always had something to say in seminars (a lot of it very interesting too) and their opinions were respected by everyone.    You might find it strange at first, being in such an environment  and doing the actual processes of learning again, but this will all fade away after a while and you will get used to things.  You will probably enjoy it too.    They didn't seem all that hip and trendy to me, but the good thing about University life is that people are a lot more broad-minded than in other contexts, and just accept you for who you are.  You don't have to be hip and trendy to fit in, you just have to be yourself and feel positive about who you are (and if you are going to Uni at 41, then you must have something positive about you).  There are people from all walks of life, and everyone understands that.  Expect people to like you, because they will.    This will be a great step forward for you, and the experience you will have over the next 3 or 4 years will open your eyes to a whole new way of the world.  I think it's great that somebody of your age is doing something like this - it is a new experience which stops you from getting into a rut, and gives your life and fun and vibrant 'shake up.'  Good on you!|`|IGSVfbGuaa	You are never too old for education.|`|a2OeOFeMaa	No. You are not too old. My neighbour went to university at age 65.

I have an elderly, gray-haired women in my macroeconomics course, but she's quite nice. I think it great when people actually go to college and learn and take it seriously. I'd prefer those not serious would just drop out.     Go for it!

I have talked to her about being a full time mum and a student quite alot, and she says that she is happy that she took the plunge to go back to uni and that although it is difficult to juggle her kids, the house, uni work, she loves it and is looking forward to makin something more of herself!!  I think u should go into education again, sure it will be hard but you will love every bit of it and i promise you, nobody will think of you as 'an old fart'    xxx|`|133rH3SFaa	it depends if you want to go to community/state college or private/ivy league.

I'm at Uni and I'm 25, and to be honest I feel I don't fit in, when you're surrounded by a majority of 18 and 19 year olds. But with anything, you get people of all sorts of ages doing Uni, there's a guy on my course who's in his 50's, and in the first year a lady in her early 40's whom I was good friends with (she ended up leaving and doing a course with Open University), and a couple of 30 year olds.  Don't worry about what other students think, I think they are more interested in themselves, just concentrate on your own studying, that's what I do, just do my own thing.  I think you should go to Uni, I am in my final year now, and it's the best thing I've done, and I've learnt so much.  Good luck, I'm sure you'll do well!|`|LxYQccQ3aa	You have to be prepared to be on your own a lot.    In my experience young students can be very bitchy towards their contemporaries and are usually worse towards older students.  They seem to think that uni is a club for youngster to have fun and if you're older you're considered a gatecrasher!  Some of them even resent the lecturers having the audacity to ask them to do some work.  They almost think that being old is contagious.  Some of them are OK but most will just ignore you for the duration of your entire course.  Many students are insecure, immature and selfish, and this can bring out the worst in some of them.  Its a bit like "The Lord of the Flies"!      Its probably best to go with the Open University.    That's just what I saw.  The drop out rate for mature students in my class was about 75%.

EfK5MMzvaa	You're in a good position right now.  Just keep up your grades and study for the SAT or ACT.  When you apply to college, make sure you aren't just applying to extremely competitive schools because then your chances or going to community college will increase.  Research less competitive schools that you would want to go to and apply to those also.  That way you have some insurance that you will be able to get in somewhere.|`|4xeRYlZkaa	Look, the reason college preparation is difficult is because college is difficult. The program is designed to prepare you for the most difficult educational experience you will ever endure, unless you go to graduate school. The key is hard work. You can only do the best you can. If that is not good enough to get into a top college, than you go to community college. After, you get your associate's degree you transfer to a good university.|`|dtA0D5dVaa	It's overwhelming because high school has done nothing to help you. I'm a grad student and also teach at my university. My freshmen students are really great at memorizing and taking tests, but that is not what college is about. You have to think for yourself. On top of that, you need the writing skills to back it up. Your question alone is rife with spelling and grammar errors. You may have a 4.2, but that won't float at any college much less the "good universities." As the economy worsens and universities lay off more faculty, it will become more competitive to even get in to any university. The deciding factor will be students who have it all: GPA, high SATs, community service, and a clear statement of purpose that shows what they will do with their education. Also, think about what  "good university" really is. Think about your major and find an institution that has a strong department. You may find that it is not one of the top 20, but will give you what you need to succeed later on, whether that means grad school or the the job market.|`|IGSVfbGuaa	you are fine, I am in the same case. Try not to think about it, just focus on life now. Or if you can't not think about it now, imagine yourself at your choice college. You WILL go to a good university if you keep up that GPA/other stuff.|`|2ik6h1cHaa	Make sure you're different from the rest. Your GPA isn't the only thing to consider to get you into your dream school. Join some clubs, join a team, be active in your community. Test scores on ACT and SAT are also factors, but don't stress too much yet. As a sophomore you should work hard to maintain good grades, but it's the last year you can really relax until you start planning for college.|`|Nin6IawVaa	Don't worry. Well don't underestimate community colleges. People don't know but they do offer the same courses for first 2 years as in UNiversities. You end up saving so much money. You can transfer in your second year to a UNiversity and just pay for last 2 years.     When I was in UCLA, many of my friends did that....they ended up in UCLA and in Yale.
JRKJ1w3Zaa	community college would be the best alternative    keep a list of universities you would like to get into and attend community college get high grades (shoot for a atleast a 3.2 GPA or a 3.5 and up for an even better university)    earn your 2 year associates degree and apply as a transfer student    contact or visit your universities of choices websites and research their transfer student requirements    plus: keep in mind your credits an classes you take to make sure they will transfer with you.    call the universities you want to attend and ask them to recommend you a community college and the courses you would need for your major.    life definately isn't over.  but please step it up in community college to prove that 1.8 GPA wrong    your better than that trust me|`|RtQaCYUuaa	Community college is your answer. Typically, cc's are open-entry institutions- meaning, they accept anyone who applies, given the applicant has a HS diploma or GED. (Don't use that as a reason to drop out, now! Diploma is better!)    CC's typically have smaller class sizes than 4-year universities. They offer a variety of degrees, including vocational/trade school type programs (automotive, horticulture, medical stuff). They also offer Associate of Arts programs - a two-year general studies program designed to be transferred to a 4-year university upon graduation.    That is your ticket to redemption. Go to a community college, do well in your 2 years there, get good grades, then you can transfer to a 4-year school. Plus, cc's are dirt cheap, so you will have saved some money in the process.

Good Luck,   I know the feeling of being unsure about your future.|`|C4WlEbIOaa	Your life is not over.  :)  You should go to a community college for a year or two, get over a 3.0, or close to it, and then transfer to the college of your choice.  Just don't make the same mistakes in college.  And, try and bring your GPA up still.  Even if you can to like a 2.0-2.5 you can go to a university.  It won't be the best one, but it will be a college. I would recommend a community college.|`|695a1f35442f9b98085dcc4c83fbeddfaa	There are multiple factors here.  If you prove that you are improving that will definately help but sadly I don't believe you will be able to get into a University directly.  You may have to start at a community college for a year to get some grades together that will show that you are a dedicated and good student.  Community college is not the worst thing in the world my sister had learning disabilities and went to community college she transfered to a University later and is now in a PhD program doing cancer research they are paying for her tuition and paying her a stipend (salary).

Your score is low, obviously, you can not go to the university.  Getting those score is dam easy, you get low that mean you did not work hard enough, you were lazy and you did not have will.   What you need to do is to pump your will up, look bravely straight into your life, admit that you are a fool 'cause you did not work hard enough and were lazy. But you can fix it, fix everything, do it again. You can do it.
AA10948829	No, of course it's not like the movies. Do you think New York really got attacked by a giant sea creature from space like Cloverfield shows?    "Freshman Seminar" is something that your school does so none of us would know.

I start high school full time next year, but I'm only going to be 13. and in class with 14-15 year old, so just letting you know, you're way better off than I am.  But I did attend the Freshman seminar at my high school and it was mainly a tour,  and explaining how the school works, and the classes available. Really kind if boring, But High school is nothing like movies, mainly because nobody could get away with half of the stuff in the movies. The worse I have heard about at my soon to be school was a bathroom was tee-pee'd and that's not even interesting!   Overall, high school is actually kind of fun, a bit of homework but you have some great memories. I haven't even started high school full time but for only my core classes (I'm in advanced placement so my classes are with the high school, i have to walk back and forth between schools!) and we have already gotten away with pranking a teacher with permission from a core teacher! It's great fun, and it's not even spring break yet!  good luck, and my best of wishes to you!|`|YRTmPJ1uaa	It depends on what you do with it. For the most part everyone worries about their own lives and what other people think of them than actually spend time judging each other. Besides, you'll be happier in the long run if you focus on classes rather than lunches.  Freshman seminar is generally either an equivalent to homeroom; a class that offers some of the general education that doesn't fit into subjects like sex or drug ed, social living, and the like; or a one time introduction to the school and life as a student.  Any answer to your question varies based on where you're going to school and where your interests lie. But don't sweat it, it'll be over before you know it.|`|VWIvlQ2naa	i think freshman seminar is like an orientation.

eLUggrV4aa	Why don't you try a project in geometry? It would be interesting too:  1.Build models showing that parallelograms with the same base and height have the same areas. (Is there a 3-dimensional analogue?) This can lead to a purely visual proof of the Pythagorean theorem, using a physical model based on dissections. The formula for the area of a circle can also be presented in this way, by building an exhibit on the Pythagorean theorem but with ``The area of the semicircle on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the semicircles on the other two sides.  2.What is Morley's triangle?(In plane geometry, Morley's trisector theorem states that in any triangle, the three points of intersection of the adjacent angle trisectors form an equilateral triangle, called the Morley triangle). Draw a picture of the 18 Morley triangles associated with a given triangle ABC. Find the 18 more for each of the triangles BHC, CHA, AHB, where H is the orthocentre of ABC. Discover the relation with the 9-point circle and deltoids.   3.Find as many triangles as you can with integer sides and a simple linear relation between the angles.

kUAljrJyaa	I would strongly suggest going back and finishing High School, however you could pursue a GED (General Equivalency Diploma - I think).  You don't mention your age but a college education is very important and will be invaluable in future pursuits.  One curious thing about your question is your desire to join ROTC as opposed to obtaining a college education.  If ROTC is your goal why not just talk to an armed services recruiter about joining the military.  Whatever you choose to do, good luck and don't get discouraged and give up on your dream.|`|DjCLWseZaa	you know that you have to go back and finish. You are just looking for an excuse. Just go.

VFQyC7Vlaa	13. the ratio of girls to boys in Ms. Snow's math class is 3:2. if there is a total of 45 students, how many girls are in Ms. Snow's math class?  There are 3 girls for every 2 boys in the class. Divide 45 by 5 and get 9. Multiply 9 by 3 and get 27, the amount of girls in the class, and 9 by 2 and get 18, the amount of boys in the class. So there are 27 girls and 18 boys.     17. What is the smallest positive value of x such that x+5678 results in a palindrome?  I believe a palindrome is a number is the same forwards and backwards. And x, having to be positive would make it that the next palindrome is 5775. so x+5678=5775. X+5678-5678=5775-5678. x=97    20. What is the smallest positive integer d for which 2009+d is a multiple of 11?  The next multiple of 11 would be 2013. so 2009+d=2013. 2009+d-2009=2013-2009. d=4    21. When 35^12 is written in decimal notation, what is its ones digit? (KEY: ^ means power of. ex: 35^12 means 35 to the 12th power)  Use your calculator to find out what 35^12 is equal to and your answer will be in scientific notation. 3.379220508 E10 This means you move the decimal point 10 places to the right getting 3,379,220,508. The ones digit would be 8. Simple as that.
QM0Ezfvnaa	No one can answer that for you unless they know how the test is graded . . . some are graded on a curve where the 'average score' of all the tests can change the score OR the highest score becomes a benchmark from which all others are graded.    For instance . . . if the highest score was a 80 . . . that becomes worth 100% and all below that are graded accordingly - you 75 would be worth an 'A' grade.    If standard grading is used . . . you got a 63% on your test and it pulled your overall average below 70%
vyVDWIehaa	I'd say maybe 60%.  That's a pretty wild guess though.  I am working in the field I got my undergrad in, environmental science.  As the years pass, the percentage will go down.  People with say engineering degrees who were working book publishers will go back to law school to make more $ etc...

OocDN5evaa	Most children worked shifts that started at 5 AM and ended somewhere between 7 and 9 PM.    Most children got about half an hour break for lunch. That was their only break.    Children would get "strapped" (whipped) for just about anything - falling behind or looking too sleepy. Sometimes children would get tied to someone's back and then get strapped, so that they couldn't run away.    Machinery was dangerous and many kids lost fingers, limbs, or lives. Because there were no unions or worker's comp, if you lost an arm you could be considered unfit to work - meaning that you lost your job and couldn't apply for worker's comp or unemployment.     Depending on what type of factory the child worked at, there were different health problems. For instance, kids that worked in mines got black lung easily. In a cigar factory, I'm not sure what exactly the children would be breathing in, but I would say smoke would be a good guess.    If a child had siblings, many times the siblings would also work at the same factory. Parents sometimes would as well.    Children were paid less than women and women were paid less than men.    Every factor - regardless of what was made - more or less had the same layout and rules; hence problems with complete capitalism. Capitalism means that the government has no say in business, so it's perfectly legal for a boss to stick hundreds of children in a tiny, tiny room with no light and make them work for fourteen hours. This is what happened.    Sundays were the only days off.    Common jobs for a nine-year-old in a cigar factory would be:  - inspecting the cigars as they are put in boxes  - putting cigars in boxes  - carrying large, heavy, heavy loads of tobacco from one location in the factory to another  - wrapping the cigar up|`|pjlsAUoDaa	a child could get stuck in the machines by simply having a loose shirt.    also, working in any factory for a child was hard. they were treated as a lesser human being compared to an adult so kids would get smacked, yelled at, payed less, etc|`|U2KPJX0Maa	The child laborers where very expendable, and that is why they were used in the 19th century so much. For example if one lost a finger or hand in the machine, they would simply be replaced with another child laborer and the first would be out of a job. There was so workers compensation, no child labor laws, or anything to protect these children in the workplace. This isn't an very in depth but just a little tidbit that comes to mind when i think about the question.|`|EMYImof1aa	working in any factory at the time was hard work, very dangerous with long hours, there were no labor unions so bosses could get away with anything, you could be fired for stupid reasons, like if you got hurt or were sick and couldn't come to work|`|9gMQAWBNaa	Read some Charles Dickens, his books give lots of examples of children working in factories.|`|LH8fibUqaa	um u might stink like tabacco or smoke at age 10 or die?
YRTmPJ1uaa	No. Fine Art relates to aesthetics, i.e. is something that is visually perceived as opposed to read or heard, and includes visual and performance art, such as drawing, painting, photography, sculpture, dance or theater. Journalism is generally perceived as either an english or humanities subject.  If you're not artistically experienced or inclined, note that most schools understand and offer introductory classes where you won't be judged by perceived talent or lack thereof, but rather the effort you put into the class.|`|4HDhjmJDaa	The above answer pretty much covered it, but just as a side note about journalism classes: they tend to be harder than you would think. Multiple daily assignments, fast-paced, tons of writing. It's a great class if you're actually looking into a career in journalism, but it's probably best to skip it if you're not.

QZeCUEJRaa	If it simply says to analyse, there are some simple thing to look at. Firstly, what kind of publication is it? A paper? Read the article, look at the language used - is it biased, emotive etc? From the title, I would guess it is. Explore the figures, are they accurate? Are they sourced? If so, check the sources out. Are the figures complete, or selective? Do they represent the entire amount of research, or a small area that is then sensationalised? Does the article actually represent the story fairly, open mindedly or reach a pre-destined conclusion?     Basically, you have to talk about what the article says, go through the different aspects and point out the problems and good points about it. Don't forget your introduction, saying what you intend to discuss, and your conclusion! Good luck!!

AA11865529	That depends entirely on where you want to go. Go to each college website and look for information for international students. It should give you the tuition and other information. It's probably the same as tuition for out of state. Public/state colleges and universities are less expensive than private schools. If you are not a native English speaker, you will have to take the TOEFL. (Test of English as a foreign language.)    The standard is 2 years for the AA degree, two more for the bachelor's, two for the master's and three or more for the PhD. That depends on the programs you go to and how many classes you take and how long it takes to write your doctoral thesis. Depending on the program, you may not have have to get the master's to get the doctorate unless you want to work in the field while getting your doctorate.    Community colleges depend on the state. It is usually quite a bit less than four year schools. Community colleges often have smaller classes and more available instructors, so it is easier. However you also have to deal with students who are just there because they don't want to work and their parents are making them go.    Staying and working here is tough unless you have a special skill or ability. If you get a master's in social work, that's a high demand field, and you might be able to get a work permit. What counts as a high demand field may change while you are getting your education.    Just so you know, in many places, you have to do an internship before coming licensed to practice psychology, if that is what you plan to do.|`|I5Hm8CYVaa	Just apply to a 4 year college, unless your grades suck, don't go community. You won't save any money that way either because you're out of the country. I have a lot of friends who were foreign students.

There are some programs that are starting up that are offering 4 year degrees or you could get a vet tech degree and a bachelor's in something else.

The school im in is considerably small for a highschool so our councelours have a lot of one on one time so my ib concelour has answered many questions like this, cause i wondered about ib or private school. On the official website for the IB program it tells you about special offers offered at universities and colleges. The thing is in my school you need atleast one year in pre ib (grade 9 and 10) to take full Ib and besides it does prepare you better and im pretty sure you need pre ib in most schools. IB will help you get into schools like ivy leagues because they know that we have a harder curriculim and our work isn't marked by our teaches but by international professors. It will definatly up your chance of getting into a better school BUT in order to really reep the benefits you have to have a high average by the time you graduate. i think that it would help you get into waterkloo especially if you took certain science courses (sorry i forgot what there called) and besides even if you just want to specialize in that you can take an IB credit, where you just did that class in ib so you dont get to overwhelmed. i dont know about the whole outside of canada and us sorry about that but hope i helped :) !

This is outside of your question' scope; but, I hope that you will enter a college and graduate from that school.   So, I would be more interested in seeing you spend time in selecting a college that is right for you.   ACT: do not repeat as your score is fine.  SAT:  repeat if you have a wide spread between "math" and "verbal" which were the two tests on the SAT, a generation ago.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	Of the two tests, the SAT is the more purely academic of the two, i.e. it's harder...if you didn't bring your calculator and aren't real quick with math then yeah i'd def retake....how could you not bring your calculator?

Equipped with a room, a bed, a supply of condoms, a red light—and voila—instant brothel. . . . These girls can make much more money at $30 a customer, than $4 per day in the factories. As is (the case) in almost every underdeveloped country!” according to the International Sex and Red-Light Guide. <br>  Sold for $30, the guide “instructs” men on where to find cheap sex around the world. This is a business venture, according to the authors, where the only principle is getting the most for your money. “If one so chooses to use her body in this manner, in lieu of social slavery at the hands of poverty employers, and men are willing to pay them more than slave labour wages, so be it. If it is not your body and not your life, it is also not your business. Until [someone] can correct the whole world’s economic condition, as well as the overpopulation problem, someone has to pay the bills.”<br>  But who? The poorest, the most vulnerable? There is no denying that the sex industry has taken on international dimensions, recognized as an economic motor for many countries, particularly in Asia. The irony is that prostitution is not entirely legal. Would legalization reduce some of the inequalities and abuse suffered by the women involved? Or by legitimizing prostitution, would we reverse decades of work to promote human rights and improve the status of women?<br>  <br>  An acrimonious debate<br>  On the surface this looks like a rehashing of a timeless debate. But it isn’t. The question is no longer about morality—is prostitution a vice and are those involved evil or somehow lacking in judgment? We now ask: is prostitution a form of exploitation to be abolished or an occupation to be regulated?<br>  This has proven to be one of the most divisive issues among women’s groups around the world. There are basically two camps—those seeking to eradicate prostitution, like the non-governmental Coalition Against Trafficking in Women and prostitutes’ rights groups, primarily based in the Netherlands, the United States and England, who view the women involved as “sex workers”. There is considerable acrimony between the two. For example, the Coalition maintains that these groups generally represent the interests of the “pimps and procurers”. In rebuttal, the rights’ groups maintain that the abolitionists are locked away in the ivory towers of academic feminism, cut off from the day-to-day realities facing prostitutes.<br>  The dividing line between the two camps lies in distinctions between so-called “free” and “forced” prostitution. Abolitionists generally maintain that the vast majority of women are forced into prostitution, while the sex workers insist that this is not necessarily the case. But as both point out, for different reasons, these distinctions oversimplify the issues. The 12-year-old Nepalese girl sold to an Aids-infested brothel in India clearly never consented to this form of slavery. The drug-addict in New York who must fulfil a quota of clients to get a fix from her pimp is not free to make decisions concerning her body. But what of the Ukrainian woman who looses her job and decides to go to Germany to work as a maid but ends up in a brothel?<br>  For the Coalition, “the distinctions between free and forced prostitution obscure the powerful structural socio-economic conditions—like poverty, marginalization, lack of opportunities and prior sexual abuse—that often drive women and children straight into prostitution situations,” says Aurora Javate de Dios of the Coalition’s Asia-Pacific branch. “Economic crisis, natural disasters, political unrest and conflict situations make women and children more vulnerable and easy prey to sex traffickers and recruiters. We see this everywhere, especially in developing countries of the South.” For Javate de Dios, laws aimed at distinguishing between free and forced prostitution will never recognize the complex dynamics involved. The most they can possibly do is to identify the most extreme forms of coercion, while ignoring the impact of poverty and implicitly legitimizing patriarchal relationships.<br>  The line between free and forced prostitution also wears thin on the opposite side of the spectrum, according to Lin Chew, a former spokesperson for the Foundation Against Trafficking in Women, a non-governmental organization based in the Netherlands. “When does anyone make free decisions, especially in the labour market? A man who works in a chemical factory, whose wages will never get him over the poverty line—did he choose this way of life? And what about the woman whose background never afforded her the chance to develop any skills? Why should this question of free choice only ap
