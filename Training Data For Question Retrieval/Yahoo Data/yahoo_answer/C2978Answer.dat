KbZi3Qm3aa	We focus our thoughts and energies today on the plight of the polar bear, an animal and a species that is in jeopardy of facing extinction due to climactic changes that are affecting every single one. Life is all so intertwined and so very intrinsic. All human and animal life breathe out carbon dioxide taken in by the flora and the fauna so that they can live. And, then, our wonderful green friends breathing in our carbons and breathing out their oxygen so that we may survive as well. The balance and the beauty of this natural dance is staggeringly simple to understand and, yet, apparently tremendously difficult to maintain. On this day, do something special and green with the intention attached that your one effort will add to those of everyone else and that all of us together will make a difference. And will bring balance back to the planet. Recycle something you normally would cavalierly throw away. Turn off the lights. Turn off the water. Don't leave it running to warm up before you take your shower. Don't leave it running while you brush your teeth. Hang your clothes outside to dry, but do remember that Feng Shui says if you leave them out overnight you are risking potential negative energies attaching themselves to your shorts. Rather try to get them off the line and in the house before the Sun goes down. Reuse your paper towels and wash your windows with old newspaper. There are a million small ways to make one gigantic difference. Do something proactive today. Do something polaractive today. You do make a difference. You can save the world. One polar bear at a time.    <br>  Warm Regards,|`|C7CaNLGlaa	AGW is a farce, a fraud, a scam, another tax increase.  The only effects we'll see is higher utility bills after Obama punishes coal-fired electric plants for providing a service.  Go figure on that one.  So when your parents can't afford to send you on that school trip, or buy you that one present you've always wanted, it will be because their electric bill doubled and tripled because of some false notion that we're heating up the planet.|`|zince8g1aa	An excellent book on the effects of global warming, with good references to the scientific literature.  You might be able to find this at your local library, as I did.

However, its a natural process, the earth has experienced this type of situation before. Except, this time around we are speeding up the process by the significant amount of fossil fuels that we burn. <br>  <br>  Its such a shame, because we are destroying the earth we live in. I wish people could realize it. There are so many consequences that could come from this. Maybes its because we, personally won't be alive to see the changes, but think about our children (for those who have children) or your grandchildren....|`|5AX3Unzeaa	There have been so many of these enviromental crisis' that turn out to be nothing to believe that this one is the one that will be true. A while back they thought it was going to be another ice age!|`|O0FGFJ69aa	I hate to break it to you but the " Dust Bowl" was not global warming in action.|`|cAMdBtFQaa	I think you are right.  It will affect us, the animals and plants that exist now may not survive the change.  The same as the Mastodon, or the Hairy rhino or any of the other animals that existed, not millions of years ago, but just thousands of years ago.  In geologic time, this was like yesterday to us.  I think you will see more environmental changes in your life time than I have seen in mine, and your kids will also see great changes.  I do not believe the changes will remove humans from the planet, but I do believe some specialized animals may die out, like the polar bear or Panda and some I don't even know about unless they can adapt in time.   The best hope of surviving this is you and your friends.  How 'you' view and approach the future will decide if humans survive.  There is a meteor on the way which is over a mile in size, it won't get here for 100 years, but 60 years from now, you and the people who are left will have to move it to avoid it hitting the earth.  I think we have more real things to worry about which are potential extinction events than a warm day or century.  Did you ever read about the dust bowl?  That was global warming in action.  We can adapt to changes like that with technology. what we can't adapt to is a poisoned planet, or microbes we can no longer live with, control or defend against.  With the growing population, global warming reducing our ability to produce food, war is a more likely end.  <br>  Get a good education so you can find a way to help feed everyone or a way to get the food distributed without the oil resources we have had.  You will have a lot of challenges in your life and the kids you have will have theirs.  It is good you think about this now, to many people wait until it is to late or never learn what to do when something happens.  Its good you have an opinion on this, it leads you to an insight as to what to do with your future and what will make you happy.|`|XU1aTqQ8aa	I don't think opinions really matter when it comes down to science.

O0FGFJ69aa	Well first you need a compost bin. You can buy one or build your own, preferably a bin with a 3x3x3 ft. dimensions up to 5x5x5, but no larger. also try to keep the bin a couple of inches off the ground to allow for air circulation into the pile. You need a even mix of carbon rich "brown" and nitrogen rich "green"  materials for best results. Brown materials include leaves, twigs, branches, straw, and paper all of which can be shredded but do not shred all of the materials, it will keep air from circulating through the pile. Green materials include grass clippings, and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds. Do not use oil, fat, grease, meat, fish, dairy products, or unwashed egg shells, these tend to attract pest, hard to kill weeds, or weeds that have gone to seed, wood ash can be used some but will increase pH and ammonia odor problems and lime. Also avoid cat and dog waste they also could attract pest and spread disease. That should be enough information to get you started, if you need any more information feel free to email me at mtwebster21@tntech.edu|`|4J8X1aKkaa	Here's how I started - quite simple:<br>  <br>  Get 2 Rubbermaid bins (13 gallon or larger) and drill a few holes in the bottom, sides, and lid for ventilation. I chose 2 so one can "cook" while I'm filling the other with fresh material.<br>  <br>  Line the bottom with paper grocery bags.  Throw in a handful of starter dirt.<br>  <br>  Get a few worms - I dug mine out of the yard but you can purchase 1/2 pound or 1 pound.<br>  <br>  Fill with organic kitchen material incuding coffee grounds, tea or tea bags (no staples), fresh veggies scraps, eggshells. I even toss in toilet paper and paper towel cores and paper egg cartons. No cooked food, no meat.  Careful with seeds - apple cores and such are just fine but I accidentally grew squash once.  When it gets too wet I toss in shredded paper or sawdust.  If using worms avoid citrus.  Smaller bits cook faster.<br>  <br>  If you gets bugs or smell add dry material and/or turn it.  I do tend to turn mine about once every week or two and and haven't had a problem.<br>  <br>  Once the "cooked" bin looks about done filter it through a screen mesh just to get out any big chunks and to salvage your worms.<br>  <br>  Easy as pie.|`|Nn4To7XKaa	Make a shallow pit in our backyard and fill it with any organic waste material.

Humans are a threat to wolves and they are far from dangerous. They are in fact fearful of humans and there has never been a single reported attack on a human. The reason they occasionally take livestock is that we are encroaching on their territories and sick and newborn livestock are easy prey. <br>  <br>  <br>  On the other hand.....this will be a good counter argument:<br>  <br>  A single wolf kills between 18-24 deer a year in order to survive. So the more wolves there are, the less deer there are. Between hunters and wolves the deer population can seriously suffer which could cause an imbalance in the ecosystem. By controlling the wolf population we are controlling the deer population in hopes to keep an ideal balance.|`|C8n5d3Diaa	I live in montana and am around wolves everyday.

Australia is my first choice but its really hard to move there as i think you need a trade.. dont quote me on that though|`|LCbYG99Raa	Australia?!|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	Places in Los Angeles and San Francisco meet those criteria, but not all neighborhoods are low crime areas. Santa Monica to Burbank through the San Fernando Valley to Simi Valley is a nice area of LA —  except Hollywood has a bunch of goths hanging about. Still, even Hollywood is a safe area to live in. Other parts of LA has gangs so you can't go just anywhere in LA. If you live at Santa Monica, the ocean breeze keeps the temperatures around 80 even when it is 100 degrees inland. On lots of days in the winter, you can wear shorts.<br>  <br>  San Jose is is at the southern tip of the San Francisco. Anywhere within 20 miles of there is a nice community. It's Silicon Valley - the computer center of the US. Other parts of the bay area are more dangerous with drug gangs. |`|ZJieXA0Vaa	California!

076i35yGaa	The US is and has always been the world leader in environmental issues.  To hear the wailing masses of liberal talk all of Europe is utopia and we live in a pig pen in the US.  I lived in germany in the mid to late eighties and traveled there a lot.  What I noticed was that Europe as a whole was at least 20 years behind the US on environmental issues.  They were still using flourocarbon spray cans, they still used leaded gas with no emissions limiters.  Not even banks were computerized back then.  They were behind in every way except for nuclear power.  <br>  <br>  The media chosen one is wrong.|`|sctBUXGmaa	well many environmnetalist believe that Obama will make the difference and lead the world to new "green revolution" , here's one interesting article <a href="http://globalwarmingdatabase.blogspot.com/2009/01/global-warming-barrack-obama-to-make.html" rel="nofollow">http://globalwarmingdatabase.blogspot.co...</a>|`|tTiBQ4Isaa	I agree with him because polar ice caps are melting very quickly, emissions have been rising dramatically, US wants to build more coal fired plants, while Ontario, Canada wants to close it down.  Also, hybrids, and hydrogen run cars have been proven to reduce foreign dependence on foreign oil.  Plus, hybrid cars are $5,000 more then an average sedan.<br>  hybrids and hydrogen powered cars, as well as in Toronto, ON, they are now charging $0.05 per plastic bag.  They should charge $0.50 per plastic bag around the world, and reusable bags should cost, $0.25/bag.  Half the price, better choices, a healthier planet for all.  Plus, supermarkets should  not offer plastic bags for placing fruits, we can prevent millions of plastic bags from heading into the landfills or becoming incinerated which increases carbon dioxide emissions!|`|5tpV7Jdcaa	You are stupid if you don't.  All the facts are clear.  Global warming is climate change and it is a crisis.  Obama is our only hope now that George Bush's policies tried to purposefully warm the planet to make Alaska more productive.  Why do you think McCain chose Palin.  To increase the value of Alaska and get Ted Stevens support with all the oil companies.|`|75977462e20038311663eefd8f52cc2daa	yes.<br>  A)  He has been pretty good about doing what he said he'd do.<br>  B)  It obviously needs to be done.  Even under Bush, the US agreed to pursue CO2 reductions at the bali climate change conference,  although only after the US was loudly booed for saying they would not.|`|i4XyIfx7aa	No<br>  <br>  i can't accept my monies cut 20% for nothing|`|zince8g1aa	Absolutely.  It's one area I see eye to eye with our president.  The United States has always been the world leader.  When we take the lead on issues, others follow.  Since global warming will require global cooperation to start, it's critical that we begin reducing greenhouse gas emissions and creating an economic environment that encourages advancement of low-emissions technology.|`|xRMmS5zUaa	it's the future and I want my country be ahead in these issues and be at least competitive with other countries such as china and Russia, etc.
AA10274310	no. in fact did you read what was on yahoo news ? The US is the bigest contributor - the biggest contributor being the most INDUSTRIALIZED nation|`|b6f0b4f3951291e57c3a094abaae9984aa	At the present time no.  The US still has by far the largest economy--hence energy use--of any country.  However, the economic growth rate (particularly in China)is very high (they're trying to catch up with us--and it's a d**m good try!)--so in a few years, they may well pass us in COO2 emissions.  Unless we, and they come to our senses and kick the fossil fuel habit switch over to alternative energy sources.  Personally I'm surprised China isn't focusing on this already--they don't have the existing investment in fossilfuel production we do--so going with alternatives for the growth part of their economy would be much easier.|`|5f0684080df3c2667a347a8926194e23aa	Greenhouse gas emissions don't have to do with population directly, but are closely related to level of industrialisation, and to an extent they are related to rate of deforestation.  So, a country that has a large population but relatively little industry will not contribute as much (sort of, not exactly).<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your specific question, China and India are both rapidly developing nations, increasing level of industrialisation at a fast pace, and both have large populations.  China is already starting to be a major contributor to global warming, and India soon will be.  Yes, it's a huge problem.<br>  <br>  Number one greenhouse gas emitter, by far, is the United States.  I think if we are serious about counteracting human impact on our climate, we need to start right here in the States.

Refueling stations commonly have underground tanks that start to leak from heat cycling, ground water pressure and old age.<br>  <br>  The fuel can contaminate the ground water, which will in turn sterilize the soil bacteria, poison the insect larvae in local streams and rivers, result in poisoned fish, potentially poisoning other predators up the food chain.<br>  <br>  Poisoning can be mild to severe ranging from liver damage, impotency, muscle paralysis, slowed reaction, brain dysfunction, death, etc.<br>  <br>  The constituents of gasoline and other petroleum fuels include hexane, hexene, xylene, heptane, octane nonane, decane, sodium lauryl sulfate, and more.

These folks are the same one's that invent a new way to describe them-selves as magnificent keepers' of humanity, when the solar/planetary mechanics change districts, and they see the need to up-date to maintain their seemingly untouchable heights of grandeur. Believe not any one moment of their description! They only aspire to re-afirm their maculate astuteness upon the ignorant masses.  Are we destined to suffer blind faith,again?
