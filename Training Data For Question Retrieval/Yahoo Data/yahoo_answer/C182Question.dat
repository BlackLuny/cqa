Sorry, i know its kind of long but i want to get it right :)      I was just wondering when people pack up bags in advance in order to bring to the hospital for when the baby's born, what do they bring?   I figured diapers, clothes... what else?   Are you suposed to bring baby formula if you plan to breast feed just in case breast feeding doesnt want to work at first? And when can you start pumping breast milk? I know my breast are creating a clear liquid, sometimes it comes out white-ish, and i was just wondering : is that good breast milk or just pre-milk? And is it possible to start getting bottles with breast milk ready before the baby is born and when to get it ready (to start pumping)?   I know that you can freeze the milk and thats what i plan to do if its possible to start pumping before the baby is born so that i can bring some when i go into labour...

I started my period around this time last month(but it was a shorter month)   I had unprotected sex for like 10 or less minutes, but our nerves got the better of us and we quit before either one of us finished.   I was out of town for surgery at the time, so I couldn't get the plan b pill right away.    I got surgery, then got home about 62 hours later, then took the pill.   Thing is, I took the FIRST pill about 62 hours later.  That means I took the second pill 12 hours after that which equals 74 hours later.   I still haven't started my period yet.      Do you think I'm ok, or is the pill still as effective postpartum?  Please help!

I went to my doctor today (I am almost 24 weeks pregnant) and he told me I HAVE to take the GTT at my next appointment. My problem with this is that I have already taken the 1 hour and 3 hour tests! I took the one hour because I was 4 pounds over their limit. That came back that I failed (the reason I failed is because the day before I OD'd on PB&J sandwiches, having no idea that would affect the test). So, I took the 3 hour test which I passed with flying colors! This is my third child and I have no history of GD, and no family history of Diabetes. I know their rule is to do the GTT around 28 weeks, but I really feel this is un-necessary, and if they had to do one at 28 weeks they should've just waited to do it! Had I of not already done one it would be no question I would do it. Like I said I really feel its not necessary and I want to know should I and Can I refuse the test legally?

20081008053518AASb6ih	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC and bummed out.....?	My husband and I have been TTC for almost 2 years now and I really had a feeling that this was going to be our month.  The last time we had intercourse was Sunday night and we have been doing the every other night thing but missed last night because my husband is a football coach at they were gone to an away game last night and didn’t get home till really late and was super tired.  Anyways, I didn’t think it would be a big deal because I usually don’t ovulate until CD15 or 16 but wouldn’t you know, I took my temp this morning and it was super high 2 days earlier than normal.  Now I’m really bummed out because I have a feeling we missed it yet again. Do you think there is still a chance?

20081009115206AA3nfK4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why are some women so lazy when it comes to using protection?	It just makes me so irritated when a girl has had one abortion already and they don't bother to say to themselves, crap I don't want to do that again maybe I should get on some birth control, or carry a condom with me. If you douche bag boy friend or fling isn't going to carry one around then you should. There are women running around with diaper bag sized purses you mean to tell me they don't have room in there to carry their own condom. Its not that hard. I can understand when you first start having sex you get all wrapped up in it, and may not have protection the first time, but once you know you are going to be sexually active you should at least keep a condom on you at all times. You cannot count on a guy to have one, because you need to look out for yourself. I just wish they would use their brains and stop being lazy. I think women should be limited to one abortion a piece. I'm not for it at all but if its going to be there, then they should only allow one.

20081103130914AAX2w87	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why won't my husband won't tell anyone we're pregnant?	My Husband and I have been together for many years, and after a year of trying we have finally become pregnant.  We told - actually, I told - some people we were pregnant early on (with my husband's blessing), but we decided to wait until the requisite 12 weeks before telling everyone else.  Well, now we're there, and he STILL won't tell anyone.  I'm "allowed" to tell anyone I want, but I feel very alone when he won't share the news too.  Is this just a guy thing?  Does it just take the father longer to get into the excitement of it?  He's excited with me, and when we talk to other people I've told, but he won't tell anyone on his own.  Please help me understand this behaviour!

I had an ultrasound done with a non-profit organization for free a couple of weeks ago and they determined that I was a whole month less pregnant than my doctor has been assuming I was.       I am scheduled for an ultrasound with the doctor on the 16th. On that day I will be EXACTLY 14 weeks along. The purpose of this ultrasound is to date the pregnancy, even though I found out that info a couple of weeks ago.      I am fairly certain this is going to be my ONLY ultrasound and I am going to be bummed if they can't tell the gender. Do you think I have any chance at all?

20081015015634AAYjVcL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Would you put up with this?  ?	My partner works really long hours at the moment.  He leaves the house at 6am and does not get home until 7.30pm and his work at the moment involves a 2-3 hr drive there and back.  I know he is tired when he gets in so i make sure that dinner is on the table, he has all his work stuff washed and ready for the next day, packed lunch is made up and once he has finished his dinner i make him a cup of tea, get him some comfort food and set it down in front of the tv.  I then watch whatever he wants and go to bed pretty much when he goes to bed so i dont have the tv on keeping him awake.  Well i am nearly 31 weeks pregnant now and am starting to feel a bit exhausted and cant cope as well as i was doing.  I get up in the morning with my 4yr old son, make sure he is ready, has had a good breakfast and walk him to school (10mins there and 10mins back).  I then put the washing on, do the washing up, clean the kitchen, sweep all the floors and wash the kitchen, bathroom and hallway floor (all tiled and pick up footprints).  I then do any shopping that needs doing and start on preparing dinner for the night time.  I am in my final year at uni so i then start work on my project (chemistry masters project) which is really taxing.  Sometimes i have to drive into uni to get papers, books etc.  I put the washing out to dry, take a walk to post catalogues (do this for extra money) then its time to pick my son up.  When he gets home i do him a snack, make sure he is changed and his uniform is sorted for the morning.  I do his homework with him (usually reading, writing, spelling etc), make him some dinner and have some play time.  Then he has his dinner (sometimes with me) followed by bath, bed with story.  By this time my partner is nearly home so i have to put the dinner on, wash up as i go along so there isnt any mess, and get it on the table.  Whilst he is eating i then make the packed lunches for him and my son for the next day and then finally get to sit down (about 8pm).  Sometime i also tutor for an hour and a half for extra money so help make ends meet.  He pays the rent and council tax and i pay for food, water, gas, electric, tv, internet and phones.        I dont mind doing stuff for him because i love him and i know he works hard but sometimes he really takes the p***.  Lastnight he came in, and because im so big now i asked if he would put my son to bed whilst i cooked his dinner.  He refused.  So i put my son to bed and then made dinner whilst washing up!  He asked for a cup of tea after he had finished even though i had just sat down and have difficulty in moving at all now!  So i got up and made it, noticing he had left his dirty plate on the side i asked him to clean it up (there was washing up water already in the sink).  After this he sat down next to me and his feet stank so i told him to take his socks off . . .which he did . . .and threw them on the floor!  He fell out with me because i told him to put them in the washing machine . . .and slept on the sofa, refusing to come up to bed.  He has gone to work this morning without saying goodbye and out of spite has left his packed lunch in the fridge.  I am so upset with him that it keeps making me cry and i cant tell if i am overreacting or not??  A bit of insight would be great because at the moment i cant see that i have done anything to warrant being treated like this!  Thanks!

20081108071900AAGCuaZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possibly pregnant are these some signs?	Last month my period was 3 days late so it made my cycle a 32 day cycle then what i normally have. This time i was calculating my period for my normal 29 day cycle and it would have been due on the 6th. and today the 8th still no sign of it. I usually spot 2 days before my actual period starts. so i know its always coming. But this time I have nothing at all. no spotting. I have cramping that comes and goes and at times it is real intense and feels like my period is here right then and there but still noting .. no spotting or anything and my cramping is here and there nothing like it always is. but it doesn't stay all day to show that my period is going to be here that night like it always does. my cramping started at the beginning of last week. also have extremely sore nipples my nipples have never been this sore before i cant even stand it. everything hurts them. they started hurting the 3rd. I am ttc. And i had sex with my hubby 2 days before my actual ovulation. And the day i had sex that was 2 days before my ovulation day i woke up with a lot of egg white cm so we did it then and there thinking i could have been ovulating early. I don't know what to think i always get my hopes up. but this time it just feels different. Im not really tired yet and i don't feel nacreous yet im not sure how soon that kicks in after you have missed your period. and is it to soon to test. my hubby wants me to wait a couple more days and its driving me nuts

20081008111518AAX2r5z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What to expect from the second prenatal appointment at 11 weeks?	I am a 28 year old woman pregnant with my first baby. I had my first prenatal appt with my OB/GYN around 7 weeks and I have the second one coming up in the next week when I will be 11 weeks exactly to the day. On my first visit, which was pretty long - around 2 hours, i underwent a physical (they did not do a pap smear beacuse I had a physical the month before and my pap smear was normal). Blood work was completed and everything was normal. They took my weight, B.P and family history etc...I had a vaginal ultrasound and was able to see the baby and look at the blinking heartbeat, but was not able to hear the heartbeat...The doctor said that I would be able to hear it at the next appt.               My question is, what will be done in the second appt at 11 weeks? I am guessing that I will get to hear the baby's heartbeat. But how is this done? Will they do a vaginal ultrasound again? Or a vaginal exam to check the baby? Any answers would be greatly appreciated.

I am 6 weeks pregnant and every 3-4 days I get this incredibly sharp pain in my lower  right abdomen for about 30 seconds. It starts high and travels lower. It feels like it could be gas but it's not in the usual left side that I used to get it in. It does seem to go away if I use the bathroom  What is confusing is I also feel it in my uterus. Could it just be that the pressure travels and causes uterus discomfort? It is hard to tell from where exactly it comes from. I had a miscarriage in april so I a bit nervous. Aren't gas pains typically on the left side?

20081029071653AAfoZHg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should I buy Pink or wait until my next ultrasound?	Ok guys I asked this question last night and I am not getting the reassuring I need. I went for my ultrasound at 16 weeks and the tech told me that if she saw boy parts she would give me a 100% reading that its a boy. She looked between legs and said well I can't give a 100% only 50%. I asked her if that meant it was a girl and she said possibly. She looked again, and said wow I am right between her legs and I say its a girl! I asked her if she was sure and she said yes 98.9% sure. Should I worry about the 2% even with the 4d ultrasound given? I have 2 sons and want a girl so bad! I am so excited its a girl I just don't want to get my hopes up on a 98.9% accuracy reading although its very high! Help! Should I start buying pink or wait until I go for next US! Also my OBGYN checked the baby's heartbeat 1 weeks prior to ultrasound and I asked how fast it was. He said 165, he asked me if I was trying to tell the gender, I laughed nad said yes, he said if he had to guess he would say girl! Can they both be wrong!
20081029070530AAeKJlt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant -What would u do if u were in this situation?	I have been married almost 4 years. I wanted a baby so bad but my husband didn't. I just found out in September (after returning from a Disney vacation with him) that he cheated on me and has an 8 month old daughter with another woman. I filed for divorce but now I found out that I'm pregnant. I must have gotten pregnant the last week of August in Disney. My husband wants to work it out and for me to retract the divorce papers. I still love my husband, I'm just very hurt and I do want the baby but just not with the situation that is going on. I can't ask what I should do b/c I know no one will feel comfortable answering something so personal but I'm asking what you would do if it were u in the situation.

20090305055938AAySbHX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should I do about the  person I babysit for?	Ok, I have been watching this persons kids now since september of 08 because they are my moms friends and moved closer to us and needed a babysitter. Ok so I have a couple of problems. One, she is starting to become really dependent on me, and sort of becoming really bossy, like telling me when I'm going to babysit. For instance one saturday night she said ok on the 7th of march i need you, no exceptions you have to work. But what if i couldn't you know. So that's is what I mean when I say she is becoming dependent. My other problem is that her oldest, who is a 9 year old boy, will tell her things to get me in trouble, and half of the things are not true and she will just get mad at me about them and not ask me, the babysitter, what actually happened, and she doesn't let me explain myself. So I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do, any suggestions would be great, and I don't really want to just quite because I don't have another job right now, if I did it would be a completely different story.

My son is 20 months and hardly ever makes it through a week without waking.  It wouldn't be such a big deal, except when he does wake in the night, he's up for 1-3 hours.  He wants to be rocked, and it just takes me that long to get him to go back to sleep!  Last night he was up for an hour.  I went in and rocked him until he started to doze.  I put him in his crib and he immediately hopped up, screamed and pointed to the rocking chair.  I left the room for a bit.  He persisted, so I went back in and rocked him for another 1/2 hour.  This time I put him in his bed, and he just settled down and went to sleep.  This can happen over and over in a 1-3 hour span, and it can happen 1-5 nights per week.        Anyone else?

20090305051034AAnlTAr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Using BBT fertility chart, if your temps are high for last half of month have you definitely ovulated?	I use fertility friend to chart my BBT.  I always get temps around 36.5 celsius up until the cross hairs, then about 36.75 after the cross hairs.      The last couple of months my post ov temps have been lower, around 36.6.      I'm having tests, gynochologist thinks maybe PCOS.      My question is, just because my temperatures rise at between 18dpo - 24 dpo and stay high until AF visits next (because believe me, she always does), does that mean I definitely ovulated or could it be possible that I didn't ovulate?      Never conceived before, don't understand why!      Advice please??? x

20090305054843AAq4kCs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Supplementing with Formula?	I have a 5-month-old son whose exclusively breastfed. Well, he was until he started solids.       Anyway, at his last appointment, he hadn't gained as much weight as I expected. I think it's because he wasn't getting enough food (milk). I work full time and pump at work. I'm only able to get as much as he needs for the next day. He takes 3 bottles at child care and I bumped his bottles up from three 3.5 ounce bottles to one 3.5 in the morning and two 4 ounce bottles. He weighs just over 14 lbs. At home, I feed him at 5:30 and again at 6:45. He goes to bed at 7. He wakes up once a night to eat and then I feed him at 6 before I leave for work.       If I go by 2.5 ounces per pound, he should be getting about 35 ounces. He only gets 11.5 ounces during the day and only eats 4 times at home. I've tried increasing my supply by feeding him every 2 hours on the weekends and pumping shortly after feeding. It worked, but I'm having trouble at work. I can pump more when I work from home, but at work, I have to pump in a dirty storage room, the bathroom, or in my car. I can't get as much at work. I've tried a heating pad, picture, reading, etc. to relax. Nothing seems to work at work.       I know he would take more than 4 ounces. I'm wondering how awful it would be to just give him one bottle of formula at child care. I would still pump as much and feed him when I'm with him. For some reason, I feel like I'd be failing him if I do this, but I know he's not gaining 4 ounces a week. I'm not a fanatic about breastfeeding, but I'm having trouble accepting the fact that maybe I should supplement him. I have no problem with people who give formula. I just haven't. Any thoughts? Is this horrible?

20090305051544AAmg5ql	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Trying to decide on a god baby doll stroller for my daughter..any input?	She is 20 months and about average height (32"). I only want a single stroller not a double. And I also want one sturdy enough to go outside. I am planning on spending about $30-45 on it. I don't want a cheap cheap one because I feel like they are a waste as they deteriorate quickly in quality. And I don't want to spend too much because she is getting a nicer one from Pottery Barn Kids for her birthday. The one for her B-day is a pink polka-dot pram style. But at the moment she is still a bit too small to use the pram shaped ones well. It's too hard for her to reach into it. So I want a forward facing style. Right now I am between these 3 really:    The MacClaren Junior XT ($30), it got decent reviews on toys r us and I know that our local toys r us has it in stock.    The Graco Expidition doll jogger ($23); This one is newer I believe so there was only 1 review for it; but it was a good one.    The MacClaren MX3 jogger ($33); again got good reviews and I think this is super cute.   Finally the Fisher-Price rainforest 2-in-1 stroller ($29.), the reviews were mixed but I just think it looks SO cute with al the rainforest theme baby stuff out there and everything!      So if anyone has either other suggestions, or has a comment about one that I listed as intetrested in please let me know. I know it seems like a lot for a doll stroller, but I hate getting her excited them it being a hunk of crap, and having to take it back ect. I prefer to research it well first. Thanks for your help!!!
20090305055420AA9N0yR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Please help..I'm concerned for my daughter, in a good way; but need advice toddlers who are/were advanced?	PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THIS AS BRAGGING, I am just attempting to find the best course of action for her level of understanding.      My main Q without the details is: can type of test, if any can my Pediatrician use to test for a very high level of developemental advancednedd in my toddler? The developemental quotent test, but read the opposite on the scale? And what can I do to help her curb her high level/ease of getting frustrated?       I have a 20 month old daughter who is very bright for her age. She taught herself to count to 10, she had a vocab of probably close to 1000 words. She uses some two word sentences. She can put together mutli-piece puzzles that are designed for children 4+years (not the kind where the duck fits in the duck shaped spot, the ones where they are actually puzzle piece shaped and have about 10-12 pieces per puzzle). She can identify almost every animal/sound. She seems to have a more advanced level of play then most other children her age. For example she will and has actually played cooperativly with other children since at least 11 months old. She understands things like doll strollers/bed are only for dolls ect. She can also engage in a higher level of pretend play since about the age of 10-12 months. I.E. she will "feed" her baby dolls, even though the bowl of food she is using is empty (something she taught herself to do), but she still says that it's yummy. On the negative side I have noticed that she is VERY strong willed, has a high level of emotion, and a slight OCD like tendancy. Like if she is doing her puzzles, and a certain pieces doesn't fit properly but she knows that the piece 100% goes where she is trying to put it...she FREAKS! Throws the pieces crys, lays on the ground screaming out of frustration ect. Also she s big on sorting things (blocks, rings, ect.). She will lay them on the ground in her certain way, and arrange them and rearragne them; and if u move/touch them she gets all angry about it. My only major concern in her learning is her inability to distinguish between colors. She can say the names off all the basic colors, but can never learn which is which. I started teaching her them at about 12 months. She learned to say blue first so that was teh first one I concentrated on. But she now associates the phrase "what color is that" strickly with the color blue. She is pretty good at identifying pink/red. But purples/blues/greens/yellows get mixed up often, if not all the time. I know that yellow/blue is a less common form of color blindness, but a form of it none the less.       So again what type of tests can they use to test/gague a more advanced child? The same developemental quotent test as for children who are a bit behind? But just go the opposite on the chart? And what do I need to do differently to curb her frustrations?       Also any idea about the colors?

20090305053120AAepVhM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I found out my daughter was playing strip beer pong. What is the appropriate punishment?	I recently let my 16 year old daughter go to an unsupervised party. She has been to parties before and I've heard nothing but good thing about her from the parents.  So I figured I could give her some leeway and let her attend her first party with no parents.  She came back 5 minutes after the time i told her to (no big deal) and everything seemed fine.  The next day I get a call from my friend telling me that the party she was at had gotten crazy and there was a lot of drinking and other things going on. His main concern was the fact that my daughter participated in a "strip beer pong" game.  He said there was a video of some of the party on youtube. I'm not that familiar with youtube so I couldn't find it but he has been my friend for 20 years and helped raise my daughter so I do not doubt him.  I immediately pulled my daughter to the side and lost it a little. I screamed at her and asked her what she was thinking.  I took away her cell phone, computer, car, and she is to go to and from school and that's it.  She is grounded until I feel she it's okay to let her have some stuff back.  Was my punishment appropriate? I feel as though i should do something else but not sure what.

20090305060152AAxLYFO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Diagnosed with PCOS and husband has poor motility (quality) How successful is IUI & what is the procedure?	I have been recently diagnosed with PCOS. My husband has just been diagnosed with a good sperm count but poor quality sperm. We will have to do IUI (50mg Clomid) and hubby's sperm will need to be washed.  I am taking the contraceptive pill Nordette and once the pack is finished or on the red pills, wait for my period. Then on day 2 - 5 of my period take 1 clomid tablet.  What procedure happens thereafter?  Also I asked my FS what the success rate is and he told us 60 - 80% chance, which to me sounds very high. (My FS is reputable and quite popular ... he's not some dodgey FS in a back alley).  Most people say the chances are the same as if you were ttc naturally and had no fertility problems being about 15 - 25% chance. Do you think my FS is right about our chances being so high. I am really upset that we may have to go through IVF because at the moment we are going to battle to pay for the procedures here as health insurance doesn't cover anything at all related to fertility :(  Hubby may also have a chromosome problem of XX instead of XY but we are getting that checked out too and will know those results soon.  Doctor said we can still get pregnant even with that problem.  Here is the website so you can all see  http://www.careclinic.co.za/ 
20090305072808AA1Yv8X	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What to do when both parents completely disagree?	Some of you single parents should count your blessings in regards to NOT having to deal with the other parent for decisions on your child. Because this part of parenting isn’t exactly easy.       I’ve posted before about my son’s behavior issues with his current hitting and screaming and total tantrums. Yes, it’s typical toddlerhood but something more is going on (possibly) because yesterday my 2 yr old threw a chair at his teacher simply because she asked him to pick up his toys. I had already wanted to meet with his teacher yesterday but when she told me this, I was really bothered by it.       Our son has a test tomorrow with a screening company and that’s the first step. But my husband was there with me when we spoke with the teacher and he kept defending our son. I’m not saying I think my son is a holy terror but he certainly doesn’t take to “no” very easily and his hitting and acting out isn’t making things that easy. And this chair throwing incident just isn’t cool.      I do everything I can at home. I don’t yell, I try to look him in the eye, I use time out (and even his teacher agreed it doesn’t work because he screams and screams and screams).       I almost wonder if my husband doesn’t get it because he’s not dealing with it 24/7. We live together but I do most of the work with our son. I’m always the “bad guy” so to speak.       I’m just at a breaking point. I’m busting my hump to care for our son, I work nonstop, we’re always on the go between keeping our son busy and going on walks, etc. And this morning our son was HORRIBLE! I almost cried…..      Anyone have advice????? Or anyone that’s been through this in regards to disagreements between you and your spouse?      Thank you!
20090305065319AA7LfRN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Hello Mums, I am after recipes for baby purees.  Any ideas?	Today I have made my little boy, Thomas, a carrot, parsnip and potato puree, he loved it.  However, he did not like the pureed shepherds pie I made him the other day, and seemed to have an issue with a chicken dinner too (philistine!!).  Lol.  So, what are your recipes for baby purees?   My baby seems to favour carrots and sweet potatoes, but obviously, I am open to all suggestions, as the more he tries, the more he will like.   Please can you give me some puree recipes?  I am off shopping tomorrow.   Many thanks

20090305072427AAdXzcL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Labor when there is an age gap between kids...?	What I'm wondering is if anyone can tell me how labor went when there is a larger age gap between kids.  My youngest will be 9 when I deliver this little girl.  Should it be quick like he was or longer like a first time baby since it's been so long?  Both of my kids were induced.  My first was on my due date and was 12 hours from when I got to the hospital and 2 hours of pushing.  My second was 2 weeks before my due date (due to BP and medical issues with me) and was 6 hours total and only a few pushes, my epideral did not work with him so I felt it all. ;)       I know no one knows what to expect exactly I am just looking for others stories when they have an age gap.             Thanks :)
20090305065523AAdQJkQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How much do you ask your doctor?	I just wondered as I see so many answers saying "ask your doctor" about even the smallest things...       Here in the UK we have a health visitor (an ex nurse/midwife who had extra training) until the baby is 5.  They come and visit every few months until baby is 2 years and you can call the office and ask for a visit if there's a problem.  We also have a doctor but I have no idea if/how I'd call her for advice... if there's a health problem we'd book an appointment.  If there was an emergency we'd go to A&E.        I feel very much like I've been left to my own devices, which I'm happy enough with... but I tend to make decisions based on lots of reading and research, plus advice from friends with babies (and occasionally my mother, taking in to account that's a bit outdated now!)      The times I have been given advice from a health professional has tended to be wrong... like when my son had a tongue tie and couldn't latch on properly I was told to continue breastfeeding... then he lost so much weight and was like a little skeleton!  He also had a floppy larynx.  We were worried about his squeaky/wheezy noise but the doctor said it was nothing, the health visitor said it was an idiosyncrasy and eventually we took him to hospital as he was struggling to feed.  They said he was being overfed and was making the noise as he was too full!  (They'd not let me feed him for 9 hours whilst waiting to see someone so no way was he full, but they wouldn't listen.) I also met a lady yesterday whose son had meningitis at 26 days old.  She was sent home from A & E twice and told that she was worrying to much.  He had a 10% chance of survival but after weeks in hospital, he's alive and home.  They're now telling her he's blind, but I saw the little boy yesterday (he's 7 months) and he was making eye contact and smiling as well as staring at toys... the paediatrician told her she's deluding herself.        So I just wondered... how much do other mums listen to the doctor?  And how much do you trust him/her?  Do you do your own research or follow your own instincts or do you trust your doctor 100%?

20090227045543AALZFwa	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is it me or is this odd?	My friend has a child who is almost a year old. I am a little worried about her as she seems to have some serious attachment issues to her little one.   She refuses to listen to any advice although she constantly is griping about him not sleeping well, or eating well etc.   When she goes out, which is very rare, she seems obsessed with breastfeeding him. She once went away for 4 hours and stopped 3 times to breastfeed him. Pulling over in a parking lot and climbing in the back of her vehicle to feed him. Each time he refused to eat.   A few days ago, she was driving home from the mall and stopped not even 5 minutes from her house to feed him again. He was not crying, just a little fussy?   I have a 3 and a half month old, and have him in several different programs, and yet have had to "pull" over and get in the backseat and nurse him.   I suggested she give him a biscuit if she thinks he is that hungry and can not make it home, but she says she isnt comfortable with this......

20090305060809AAQO24i	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	I Posted this yesterday but didn't get many answers...It's long but I need some thoughts (WARNING TMI)?	Ok, I do not think I am pregnant, but a thought happened to occur to me and I need some thoughts on the situation......   Ok, so I have had a really odd month this month. Let me start by giving just a few key points: I am not on BC, do not use protection, and normally have regular cycles but they are occasionally 2 no more than 3 days late (that's rare). My periods are also very heavy and last for about 5 days and is heavy from the first day til the day before it is over.   Ok, now that you guys know those things here is the rest of the situation...I was suppossed to start my period on the 8th of February but did not get it until the 27th in between that time I took 6 HPTs which all came back negative. I think that my cycle was trying to reset itself, but anyway...about 2 weeks before the 27th I had a lot of cramping, discharge, sore BBs, and a few other symptoms (I am assuming it was a late ovulation) well, since my period was not here yet I decided that I would get as much BD in as possible (since the tests kept coming up negative) and I finally got my period on the 27th (this is where TMI is) It started (Kind of) when I got up in the morning but it was not really normal. It was a brownish color but it was mixed in with some kind of CM and was kind of stretchy(not sure if this would be the right word) then I didn't get anything else until that night. I finally had to put a pad on the next day but it was still pretty light. The third day it did pick up a little but still was not as heavy as usual and it was brown and red mixed together. The forth day it went really light and brown again (I thought it would be finished by yesterday). Then Yesterday it stopped except for when I wiped and then it was brown again most of the time but did have a slight pink tint once. When I went to bed last night I had nothing(no period), so figureing I wasn't pregnant I decided to start right away (I know most women do not conceive the day after their period but I wanted an early start lol) When I woke up this morning I had more brown blood again not a lot but just enough I decided to put a panty liner on to be safe.    So, I tell you all of this because a thought occured to me, if the cramping and other symptoms (which are gone now) I was having was ovulation and we BD around that time, do you think this bleeding was my period and just weird because of the lateness or was it implantation? I doubt that I am pregnant but want to see what some other people would think about it. (I'm not going to buy a test until I miss my next period but am getting oppinions anyway)

20090227041216AAw86yj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Please respond, I need some more opinions?	Hi, sorry I have posted this a couple of times but Im desperate for a little more feedback. I tested for pregnancy on Monday (8DPO) twice and each time got a really really faint line. I took both tests apart just after the time limit had expired to get a closer look and lined the strips up and they matched exactly in the same spot. I wasnt sure if I was imagining them! Tuesday morning (9DPO) I tested again and there was a line again and this time it was more visible and I could see it quite easily holding it at book reading distance. The control line was a dark pink/purple colour and the faint test line was the same colour but lighter and much much fainter. However, I tested again yesterday and today and there is no line! My period is due Sunday so I will guess I will have to wait and see if AF arrives, however I wondered if anyone has experienced the same and were in fact pregnant? Is there such a thing as HCG coming and going and then coming back in early pregnancy?! Im just confused about the whole thing and welcome your thoughts, thanks in advance x
20090227055504AAkfc4U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you feed your 10-12 month old?	Are you still doing purees?  Or is it mostly finger food?  If so, do you just feed them exactly what you eat only cut into bite-sized pieces, or do you prepare seperate meals for them?        Besides bite-sized veggies, soft fruits, crackers, bread, and pasta, and bite sized pieces of meat, what do your babies like to eat?  Are you still really avoiding salt or do they end up eating what you make for yourself which probably has salt in it?      Sorry so many questions.  I'm just wondering how creative I can be with my 11 month old son.  I think he's bored of frozen peas and pieces of whole grain bread and tasteless boiled chicken.  He seems to love BBQ ribs and meatballs.  Is that bad?

We baby danced all around the time i should have been ovulating. My boobs have been feeling a little sore, nothing horrible though. Yesterday i was in wal-mart with my daughter & mother, and got very light headed, assuming i was hungry we grabbed a bite to eat, while i was eating i began feeling faint again. After lunch i decided to grab a pregnancy test. I got the clearblue digital. (AF isnt due until tomorrow but i wanted to test anyway because the box said up to 5 days before missed period) Took the test around 4pm yesterday & it said "not pregnant"..later on i was cooking dinner and had to sit down due to feeling hot & faint again. I tested this morning with first morning urine & got another "not pregnant"       Has anyone used the clearblue digital tests before AF was due with a negative result & got a positive after AF was due?

I think it might be because I'm completely over the initial shock and I'm not allowing myself to feel any excitement until I know everything is real. I'm fed up with the period like cramps as well...I had them on and off for 2 weeks, then they stopped completely for 2 days, then last night I had them worse than ever.

20090227040021AAnnVsr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Snuffly baby....any tips?	My 10 week old baby has a really snuffly nose.  She doesn't appear to be blocked up during the day but at night it sounds like she's snoring.  She doesn't have problems breathing but the snuffles sound really bad, if only she could blow her nose lol.  She also brings a lot of her feed back (shes 100% breastfed).  The pediatrician gave her medication as he thought she had reflux but it made no difference so he took her off it.  They've also said to try clearing her nose with a little saline solution (I live in the Canary Islands so treatment is slightly different).  He also said to try and remove the mucous by using a little nose clearer (its like a tube you put in their nose and suck out the snot...it does work!) but thats not making any difference either....any tips on how to clear her snuffles??
20090305070536AAKiEuL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Help with baby crying?	I know that there are probably a million reasons but my baby will not stop crying sometimes!!    Usually shes is very good. She is just over 5 months old and in a structured 4 hourly feeding routine with regular naps during the day and will normally sleep very well at night, still waking once for a feed then going straight back to sleep. recently she has started waking during the night 2-3 times and being very restless. then is cranky during the day and wont sleep in the afternoon. i have given her infant ibruprofen in case its teething pains - this does nothing. she drinks 3oz of cool boiled water a day and has plenty of wet nappies and usually poops at least once a day. she is always burped although i know that crying makes them gulp more air. does anyone have ANY other ideas why she is crying?? we have not changed her routine at all so i am really confused. also she seems fine until her afternoon nap, so it seems whatever is upsetting her is time-specific.    Any suggestions or ideas are welcome, thank you.

Some that come to mind are "Juno" “The Secret Life of the American Teenager” "Star and Cole on OLTL" and lets not forget "Jamie Lynn Spears".       Sure these shows may be entertaining to watch but what are saying to young impressionable teens? These shows most often glance over the real hard ships that teen parents face, and seem to always wrap it up in a nice pretty little bow. Telling young girls that it's "in" to be a teenage mother.       So...what are your thoughts? Do you think the media is glorifying teen pregnancy?

20090305070601AAkytZF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Weird period or what?	Hi!  I posted yesterday that AF has shown her ugly face, however....      My cycle is usually 26-28 days, and my last period was on Feb 2.     We have done our part and was in the dreadful 2ww from the 16th on.   I had sore breasts around the 21st through now and started having what I thought to be period cramps on the 26th.  My period was due on the 1st, and AF was no where in sight.  I took a HPT that morning and got a BFN.  How ironic that I thought I started that exact same day!        It started as my normal spotting but on the 2nd when I woke up and went to the bathroom, there was a lot of CM and a streak of brown stuff.  This is not normal for me.  On the 3rd and 4th there was the same stuff mixed in with a little bright red spotting.  Today nothing.  I just wondered if this was just a weird period or implantation bleeding?      Since I took the HPT and got a neg and started my "period" I don't think I'm pregnant, but should I take another to be sure?

20090305072503AAYABrG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why is my 4 month old ALWAYS so grumpy?!?	she cries when it's time to sleep (nap time or bed time) and if I go off to do any housework, even when she's in the same room (in a bouncer or whatever). If she had her way, we'd spend all our time feeding ducks or in the swimming pool or just sitting on the sofa watching tv!      I know the housework thing is just separation anxiety, and this is getting better over time, but the sleep thing has just got worse over the last week or so. If we put her down awake, she will cry for exactly 7 minutes (every time, and she has done since she was a month old, it's wierd!), but if we try to soothe her to sleep, she fights like billy-o and wears herself out rather than actually getting off to sleep, but then she will sleep all night long once she is down. It's upsetting that she only goes to sleep if she has cried herself to sleep and often she wakes up crying too.      will she grow out of this? and why has it got worse so suddenly?      help!

I have been back and forth to the Dr's and had a number of different tests but they all came back fine.  I noticed the other day that when i stand in natural daylight i have loads of blue veins on my breast and I've never noticed this before, I'm also urinating a lot more and always have a headache.  I have had a bit of unusual spotting which lasts a hour or so and an increase in vaginal discharge.  I'm finding that I am always hungry too and feel sick if I don't eat straight away. Than when I did a urine sample this morning I noticed that I had little white flakes in it, I also had my Iron levels checked a week and a half ago and they were fine and than again today and it showed today i am anemic. Do you think I could be pregnant, and just not showing up yet I would be four weeks pregnant today if I am.   All ideas and info welcome, similar experiences and the outcome etc. Cheers!

20090305072301AARN9kR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is abortion REALLY murder?	I'm just curious, I keep getting biased responses about this question depending if the person is pro life or pro choice. Well, to consider it murder, we really need to know what murder is. So, murder is defined as " The unlawful killing of one person by another, especially with premeditated malice."   Knowing this, what makes a person a person? Consider the following examples.      1. A robber shoots the thumb off of a bank teller when she reaches for the emergency button.       2. A man mugs someone and leaves them brain dead and on life support. Years later, whenever the victim's life support fails, the attacker's sentence is promoted to murder.      In the first situation we would not call this murder: nobody would. Why? Because the victim lost human TISSUE! It is not a PERSON. In the second example, it is murder because it is the death of the brain that results in the death of a person.       So, if an abortion occurs early on when the brain has not developed yet, then what is being destroyed is human tissue and not a person. It does not have conscience or thought or reason and CAN NOT feel pain because neurons are needed for that. Clearly it is not murder.

20090305073757AAJEMs0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My daughter is ten months and still doesn't sleep through the night. What could be the problem?	I nurse and early on say like when my daughter was three days old i discovered the joy of nursing while in bed to get some sleep. Big mistake. Now my daughter won't sleep in her crib at all. I thought it had something to do with her being used to sleeping in my bed and snuggling up next to me at night. I put her in her crib when she first falls asleep but she wakes up an hour later and i put her in the bed with me. she almost immediately goes back to sleep but she still wakes up wanting to nurse and then just toss and turn all night. I haven't sleep through the night since she was born. And i don't think she's sleeps longer than two hours straight at a time. Could there be something wrong with her. I got some advice from the doctor to just let her cry it out until she cried herself back to sleep. we tried this for about five days because she would sleep for an hour, cry for two, sleep for three and before you know it it's morning and then she wants to sleep all day. so i gave up because she would look so tired during the day.

If we go out to eat somewhere and there's a ceiling fan she'll have her head turned straight up to the ceiling watching it, smiling.       People with glasses. I guess it's because I wear glasses, but if you wear glasses...she loves you, instantly. (I think it's because she's secretly plotting to grab them and bend them, like she has mine!)

20090305091822AAOYYOu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How to go about introducing solids?	My son has been eating rice cereal here and there since 4 months. We just tried it a couple times a week or so at first until he started really being able to take in bites and swallow them correctly. Now he is eager for the next spoonful and hardly gets any on his face at all. So we started some veggies and fresh banana. What I am wondering is how to go about this? I know to wait a few days in between each new food to watch for reactions, but that's really all I know for sure. I started having his sitter feed him solids while I am at work so we could avoid giving him any formula (I only miss one feeding), but I just don't think she is doing it right. She says he'll eat like half a small jar of veggies and a good amount of rice cereal, and still she'll top him off with a 2-4 oz bottle of formula. Is that way too much food?? She said he eats it just fine. (Honestly I think she is just trying to get him to sleep with the bottle) So I asked her to just give him a bottle of formula and I will worry about the solids so I can monitor how much he eats. What I'd like to know is:   How many times a day should he be eating solids?   How much should he be eating?   What other things can I try? (He has had butternut squash, carrots, green beans, peas, and fresh banana)   Please give me some specifics on starting solids. Maybe a good reliable website?   Will he tell me when he is full?

20090305081143AAucKTQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	3 year old and toothpaste?	My daughter was using the potty and when she came out of the bathroom she had my toothpaste. It was on her hands and in the sink and her breath smelled of it also. I am not sure if she swallowed any but she did say she did and then she said she didn't but she also said the dog made her do it. So I don't know what to do, I know that I am suppose to take her to the ER if she did, but she hasn't vomited and she doesn't seem like her belly hurts. She always goes to the bathroom by her self and we never have to worry about her getting into anything because we always have everything up where she can get into it. But this morning my husband left it on the sink and I didn't see it, I feel like a bad mom. I don't even have anything in the bottom cabinets in the kitchen, my house is completely child prof. What should I do? Just go ahead and take her or just watch her? I'm freaking out.      I already asked this in health but I need your opinions too.
20090305085525AANZ5hi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	A question for all you pregnant ladies: what would you do?	My sister is 24 weeks pregnant and high risk because not only is she overweight, but diabetic too.  This is her third pregnancy, the first ended in a miscarriage at thirteen weeks and the second was two weeks shy of his due date when he died in utero of an infection.      When the second died, the doctors induced her pregnancy and wanted her to give birth naturally.  She was in labor for two days and they had tried to use every method they could including the use of force-ups for her to give birth before they decided to give her a Cesarean.  The doctors told her that her cervix was incredibly small and that if he were to ever get pregnant again a natural birth would be extremely hard on her.      With this pregnancy they have given her the option to get a scheduled Cesarean, but she has turned them down.  Now, my question for you ladies, what would you do?  Would you go through with a natural birth knowing how hard it was last time and knowing what the doctors have said?  Or would you get a scheduled Cesarean?      Thanks a lot!  Sorry if it's long.  =)

20090305090148AAsHyzb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Could my milk be coming out too fast for my 3 week old?	So I think my milk may be coming out too fast for my little over 3 week old son.  Most of the time when I am breastfeeding him he starts to cough and cry and my milk doesn't spray out, but it leaks out pretty bad.  I actually don't leak at all, just when I am nursing and he lets go I noticed it drips pretty bad.  He also swallows a lot of air and gets all mixed up when trying to breath and has to take a break and catch his breath.  Another thing is that he has bad gas a lot of the time because I think he is swallowing so much air and I can't always get a burp out of him.  Also I think I might be making too much milk because I read that getting too much fore milk and not enough hind milk can cause a baby to have gas.  How can I fix this or will he just grow in to being able to handle my milk flow.  This is my second child and I didn't have this problem with my first.  It is very frustrating when he wants to nurse and just starts crying.

20090305083030AAWzHvd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do your children collect?	My 11 year old daughter collects Littlest Pet Shop (she plays with them like most children play with Barbies, which she was never really interested in  She likes animals though, and plans to be a veterinarian) and Bella Sara cards.  She also has a lot of Cinderella collectible dolls, and other girly trinkets.  She has a lot of heart shaped things she has found-heart shaped leaves and rocks, for instance.        My 8 year old son collects cars (Hot Wheels, Matchbox, Tonka and the Disney Cars) and dragons/dinosaurs.  He also has a small coin collection, like Daddy who has a large one.        My 1 year old has quite the assortment of rubber duckies-she loves ducks, and we have docks in all colors and sizes, along with ducks dressed up as a lamb, easter bunny, Uncle Sam, a ghost, a pilgrim, Santa, etc.  She also likes Bob the Builder, but no collection related to that.

20090305085702AA0TBqL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Homeschoolers and Socialization?	Why do so many people feel that school is the only place where socialization occurs for children?      I homeschool my children, and I am so sick of hearing about the supposed lack of socialization.  School is NOT the only place, and it certainly is not the best place, for socialization to occur.      My older children are 11 and 8, and have always been homeschooled.  They socialize with other children on a regular basis-at church, Scouts, baseball, basketball, and with our homeschool group which gets together for a variety of activities such as P.E., play dates, Valentine parties, Science Fairs, Geography Bees, field trips-you name it.  They go to friends and cousins homes, and have friends and cousins as guests at our house.  We often have to pick and choose what to do that day, because there is more than one option and we can not do it all.      I think that people are ignorant about what homeschooling really is.  They think that because they go to school, and are in school all day, then homeschoolers must be at home all day.  Our lessons take much less time than a traditional school day, giving us more time to socialize.      In addition to what I have already said, they get "real world" socialization.  I do not care what anyone else says-school in no way prepares anyone for the real world.  It is similar to nothing else in the real world, except maybe a nursing home.  My children are out in the real world, though, because they accompany me on errands and socialize with the elderly lady in line behind us at the grocery store, the baby in the waiting room at the doctor's office, the mail man at the post office, the teller at the bank...their socialization is not limited to only those born the same year they were and from roughly the same neighborhood.      Of the children they are exposed to in their various activities, there are white, black, Asian, Indian (as in from India, not Native Americans) and multi cultural children.  We are involved in activities at churches of three different denominations-all Christian, but they are also exposed to children that are Jewish, and those that do not believe.  We are middle class, but have friends that are poor and friends that are very wealthy.  Some are homeschooled, some are private schooled, some are public schooled.  There is a variety in the people they are exposed to is the point I am getting at.      AND, to finish this for the time being, they still learn to work together as a team (wich each other and at the various activities), they are still exposed to conflicts (with each other and at the various activities)...they are NORMAL children.      Does anyone have any idea why people continue to believe the stereotypical myth that homeschooled children are unsocialized?

I had a few early ultrasounds but since they were a few days ahead, then a few days behind, we just kept my date.       I felt light bubbles a week ago and I was unsure if it was the baby. But the movements became much stronger that I can tell it's not gas bubbles. It's tapping now and enough for me to know! My question is this normal to feel the baby moving so much? The baby moves everytime after I eat and if I drink something sweet. And it moves a lot at night when I'm laying down trying to go to bed. But it only moves if I'm in a certain position. Haha, it's so cute! It moved a lot last night!      I only gained about 4 pounds or so. I was 103 before my pregnant. I have a mini bump for sure. Is it because I'm slim, that's why I feel the baby move so much?      Thanks!

I'm having twins so a C-Section is always going to be on the cards until our baby boy moves into a head down position.

I have a few more scans before my due date so we will have a better idea in about a month's time.

20090305082405AAnp9uq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Excessive bleeding (non vaginal) while pregnant?	Last week i noticed a blood like blister on the back of my shoulder, I've never had anything like this before. Yesterday i guess i has scratched that area not realizing that i "popped" it i guess. I felt my shirt getting wet so i reached back and my hand was covered in blood. I went to the restroom to get a better look with a co-worker following close behind, i was a pin needle size area and it just bleed and bleed, we tried to put pressure on it and it just kept bleeding... alot!       It finally stopped and later that night, my luck, i dropped my razor in the shower on my toe, it nicked my toe and it gushed. Puddle of blood in the tub. I got out, put some TP around it while i dried off and it soaked the TP to the point that i could literally ring-out the blood.       I realize that we have 40-50% more blood in our bodies when pregnant, but are we suppose to be bleeding like this over minor nicks and cuts?       I am 29 weeks.

I wanted to see how much other babies around his age were eating. His doctor said he is gaining weight properly but that I should try and push him to drink 4 oz but when I do that he throwsup.  How much is your baby eating and how old is he/she?

I know that it is routine to have a pap smear when pregnant.   However, i had one done in April 08 (less than a year ago) as i was pregnant then, then started badly bleeding the day after i had it. I lost that pregnancy at 7 weeks.      Firstly, will i get one even though i had one less than a year ago (with perfectly normal results)   Secondly, if she still wants to do one, can i ask her not to do one?       As a patient can i waive my right to a pap smear?

20090305090501AAWyjCo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	In my small town a mother and her 1 year old baby...?	were murdered the night before last.  The killer is presumed to be her boyfriend (not the baby's father) and he is a known meth/alcohol user.  All stories in the paper indicate, as they always do, that she was going to clean up her life blah blah blah.  They were beaten to death with a back massager.      My question:  We all know that it is easy to tell people on here to get away from their abusive boyfriends/husbands because this story may be the end result of that abusive relationship.   Couples who have been together long term: Do you really think you would be able to leave your better half if there was a problem with addiction?  Would you stay and try to get them help?  When is enough really enough?  What if this young lady was giving him a chance and he flew off the handle?        As a responsible parent, should you really give an addict a second chance?  It just cost a one year old little boy his life, and I am sure this happens everyday.

Like I said in the question I am 17 weeks pregnant and last night I had a very sharp pain in my lower stomach. It hurt so bad that I could barely walk. There was no bleeding. It happened after my husband and I made love, and it was hard. Could that be the reason why? When I laid down then it went away slowly. This morning when I woke up I felt different, like there might be something wrong. But I discharged just like every morning, so it was the same routine. My husband said that I'm just worrying too much so he won't take me to the hospital. What do you think? Thank you all in advance!

20090305080043AA4UL5Y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	A baby has such a bad diaper rash that she just crawls around screaming?	THIS IS NOT MY BABY!   This is a little girl that I watch.  She has had this diaper rash for about three weeks now.  It is so raw and is everywhere from the top of her butt to the front of her diaper and even on her legs a little.  She just screams all the time because she is in pain.  When I have to change her diaper it is horrible, she just cries and cries.  I have been putting diaper ointment on it and it looks a little better by the end of the day when I leave, but when I come back it is horrible again.  I don't think her parents bathe her regularly and I don't think they changer her diaper or put the ointment on frequently enough.  Is there anything else I can do to help this go away?

I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 7 month old. I am worried that my kids won't see me as being their mom anymore because they are spending the majority of the week at daycare. My 2 1/2 year old really likes going to "school" but i think a big part of that has to do with the fact that she is only their 2-3 times a week. My 7 month old does well, i just feel especially bad for her because with my older one i was home for one year. I am just worried that she will forget that i am her mommy. I love the way she looks at me when i come in a room, she lights up and gets so excited. I don't want that to change.

My son is 6, soon to be 7 and he seems to have lots of friends at school and he plays great with his little sister and his cousins etc but when he has a friend over from school he just doesn't seem able to play nicely. He always insists they do whatever he chooses even if they don't want to, he gets really grumpy for the first hour or so, they do eventually work it out and play by the end but the first hour or two just seems to be fighting about who gets to play their game. Is this normal for this age group or is my son being difficult? He sometimes complains when he's been round friends houses that it was boring because they made him play their choice of game. At this age its a lot of imaginative play so if you don't want to play "dogs" or "mums and dads" I can understand why there'd be tension.

I am currently on cd uhhhh 53, longest cycle Ive ever had, near about almost three weeks late for AF, I have tested on the day of af, BFN, im now 18 days late, I tested a few times each week, 1 after, 2 after, and last night, I tested and waited for the pink line to move across the window and it never did, so I was thinkin i might just be impatient, I waited a minute or two and got busy with something else, and forgot about it, well this morning I go to POAS, first thing, and the one from last night, the one on TOP, was this.(refer to top test pic)..Im not sure if thats a BFP, orrrr a faulty test, I mean even the line on the right isnt the same as the one I took from this morning, but then the one I took this morning, the one on the bottom, is lookin like a BFN...Im so confused. Is this test faulty, or is it possible a "chemical pregnancy" could of happened so fast, or  could I possibly be Preggo...orrrr  am I just nuts?? lol ( Im tryin to have a sense of humor in this stressfull time)....please help me out......             http://i597.photobucket.com/albums/tt58/... 
20090305090620AAShZHy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this normal for a 9 week old?	My baby will be 9 weeks tomorrow. She is growing/gaining well, and has no medical concerns.      My questions is this;      Is it normal for a baby this age NOT to engage people by smiling and cooing?        She does smile and coo, but it isn't necesarily at people. She will smile in her bouncy seat and make cooing sounds,  but she makes very little effort to make eye contact and smile at us. She seems to be more interested in looking around the room.    I try to play with her and hold her as much as I can in attempt to engage her, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. She does not fuss or arch when held, she just doesn't seem to be overly interest in being social.      My other children all tried to engage us with smiles and cooing at this age so to have her not doing this is new ground for us. I appreciate your input.

20090305091207AAVuXIj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Disapline for 7 year old step daughter?	Ok I need an opinion from other parents…I have a 7 year old stepdaughter…her mother is not in her life. that acts out badly in school/home.  Yes we have her in therapy because of what she has went through with mom, and she has been seen by a neurologist for testing.  Nothing other than she is adhd is wrong with her…but was told a very mild form of it.   She seems to defy any and all authority..she refuses on a daily basis to do what she is told.  She tells teachers no! She lies to your face and continues to lie when caught, she has no concern for other people, she is bossy and don’t care.   for those of you who know 1st grade they pull cards when in trouble yellow first then to red.  Well she gets on red at least 3 days a week and the other is yellow for the same incidents over and over.  Well last week she really pushed it. she pitched a tantrum in the floor because was told to stop playing with her necklace (which she was told she could not wear to school)  then threw her card in the floor and said she will not turn it and had to be removed from the classroom 2 days last week for behavior.  Now we have put her in time out. Took all priviledges away and she has yet to earn them back.. We have mad eher write I will listen over and over. We have talked to her..went to school and talked to teachers..they all say she has no remorse for what she does. And that is the same at home. TV was taken from her last Thursday for the horrible week she had. well of course she was good for her dad sat and sun so he gave the tv back and let her play. Well she was to get on greens all week then get it back….i was against it but ultimately she is his daughter.  So I let it go…well sure enough she went right back to getting on red this week for the SAME things…no respect, lying, refusing to do as told…talking and playing when not supposed to not to mention came home and when was told to go to room and write she threw a fit I closed her door and she kicked it and locked me out…screaming no no no so I got on her level and advised her there will be no getting off of punishment by playing up to the parents this time.  Her behavior will not be tolerated and she will learn to respect people or she will not have fun or priviledges .. So..i told her dad ..if we do not stand up together to her she is ganna continue to run you over…she really don’t like me to much cause  I am what you call a sergeant mom..ha…but I have a 15 year old too…ok sorry so long but thought you needed history…   ok my delima is if this is too harsh…she is to come home and write everyday (she hates it)  and she is grounded till she gets a week of being good then she will earn tv…and play rights…she has to remain in her room unless eating and bathroom/bath etc....but not to play or watch tv or just hang around her step sister..   and I know she is probably acting out because of mother not being there..but where do you draw the line…she cannot be like this.  she gets attention at home..we have a very stable life and home, for 2 years now.

20090305091429AAHAuUV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy confusion.... Please help!?	Okay heres the deal. I was unsure if I wanted a baby so I took out my nuva ring for a couple days ( and had sex both days) then I put it back in but not for the full 3 weeks. So then I decided even if I didnt want to get pregnant I didnt like how much weight it had made me gain so I took it out again. Then about a week later (valentines day) I had spotting but I never had a regular period. Which is very unusual for me. So basically I havent had a period since the end of january. Well about a week ago I took a pregnancy test and it was negative. But on the other hand I checked my fertility dates and it said it was the 24th-28th of febuary. And I had sex on all of those days. So if I concieved on those dates the pregnancy test might not be correct. I'm so confused.... anyone have any advice??

Since these were taken before my period is due is pretty certain im not pregnant or am i just testing too soon?
20090305092157AA3TU6f	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Telling my family that I am pregnant?	I am a 26 year old woman.  I have been married for over three years, and I have an eight year old daughter, and a two year old son.  My daughter was born under not-so-great circumstances.  I was in an abusive relationship, I was only 18 years old, I had to drop out of school, and wasn't living my life "right".  However, when my daughter was 2, I got my act together, left the "father" (who hasn't seen her since then), and started living my life right.      Flash forward to 2005.  I met a wonderful man who accepted my daughter as his own, got married, bought our own house, and then, in early 2006, we planned to have a child.  I got pregnant almost immediately.        We were both so excited, but my mom in particular was not.  She yelled at me for several hours, then got over it, and was happy for me.  I don't know if she thought about the circumstances in which my daughter were born, and had a flashback, or what, but she freaked out on me.  I was 23 years old at the time, 24 when my son arrived in early 2007.       I went to the doctor and got put on birth control pills in December. (I was on the Depo shot, but was having negative side effects.)  I took them as directed, starting ten days before having unprotected sex, to make sure that they would be in my system, as advised.  I took them every day, at the same time, not missing a pill.      Recently, I've been feeling really bad, and *knew* I was pregnant.  After taking a pregnancy test last week and getting a negative result, I took four yesterday (EPTs, digital, etc.).  All came back positive, and I am pregnant again.      It was not something that either of us really wanted at this point in our lives, but we are ready to step up and face responsibility, and love this child as we do our other two.  However, we are scared as to how our families are going to react, in particular my mom.  We are worried because we live in a three bedroom house, and we already have two children, although we have discussed putting our other two in a room together, to make room for the new addition.  Again, we weren't really ready for this, but we both know that nothing is 100 percent.  It wasn't our plan, but apparently, it was in God's.      My parents are wanting to take us out to dinner next week.  I am thinking that that may be a good time to tell them.  How should I tell them?  I told my husband that we should explain the situation, that this wasn't our plan exactly, and that I was on birth control.  My mom knows I was on birth control because I called her the day I was at the doctor's office.  I just don't feel like getting yelled at by them, or by any of my husband's family, when honestly, we did all that we could to prevent this.  Any advice on how (or when) to tell them?  It's pretty ridiculous that I am a grown woman and worried about this, but I am having a hard time accepting this, and really don't need people bringing more negativity to the table.  Any advice is welcome.  (We would not like to drag this out.  We want to tell everyone as soon as possible, so as not to seem like we are trying to hide it from them.)
20090305091639AAieKHA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How can I get my 3 year old to stop being so preoccupied with what others are doing at play time?	My neighbor's 2.5 year old often spends her days with us and I have noticed that my 3 year old cannot seem to do anything without involving her.      Even at snack time she can't eat because she is so busy monitoring our neighbor's chewing. In the playroom if the 2.5 year old picks up a toy and begins to play with it - that is just the toy my 3 year old needs.  She doesn't enter the playroom and go for a toy, it is almost as if she has no mind of her own. She only knows the value of something when someone else has it.       I took them to the toy store and gave my 3 year old first dibs  choosing whatever she wanted. After carefully choosing what appeared the coolest and most amazing toy and getting high fives and complements and seemingly very Happy with her choice it was the 2.5 year old's turn. Being 2.5 she just grabbed the first thing she could reach.  My daughter spent the rest of the trip trying to convince the 2.5 year old to switch toys. It gets to the point where the 2.5 year old gets so frustrated with her that if she could articulate well  enough she would say, "this is harassment, get a life already!" What can I do? I don't want this behavior to become a fixture in her personality.

20090305100451AANIHtP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	8 month old refusing bottles?	My 8 month old son has been refusing his bottles lately. He started this at about 6 months.. You touch the bottle to his lips and he would cry and fuss and move his head away. Eventually I found a technique to get it into him by just squeezing his cheeks lightly and putting the bottle in his mouth while shushing him loudly... and he would give up and drink the bottle. I spoke to my Doctor and he said that he was sure that this was just a phase.       While lately he has become even more adamant and my little tactic doesn't work anymore. He cries, screams, yells, moves his head side to side, and if I do finally get the nipple in his mouth he pushes it out with his tongue. I have tried waiting a few minuets and giving it back, I have tried different times of the day, but to no avail. He will only drink his bottle when he feels like it.       I ususally feed him a bottle at 7:30am, 11:30am, 3:30pm and another at 7:30pm...       Today he ate 5 oz at 7:30am and completely refused his 11:30am bottle, when I tried to give it to him again at noon and 12:30 he refused it with the same vigor and was rubbing his eyes so I just put him down for a nap.      I am afraid that if he skips bottles hes not going to get what he needs in a day. He is cutting the top two teeth, but didn't have this problem when he cut the bottom two.... Has this happened to anyone else? How did you cope? Is dehydration something to worry about? What could be the reasoning for this? It isn't the formula because he has been drinking this stuff since birth..... Please help I am so worried!

Would a little girl be mad at her mother for bring her in the world, and never having a father?  She knows that her mother loves her very match and always wanted to have her.  Her mother is a very good mother.  Her father is a sperm donor from a sperm bank.     Then when she hit 11, and DEMANDED that she find the father.   Her mother  spend a lot of money trying to actually get around the anonymity clause. No luck.      From question  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

20090305093933AAK3RQ7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	"Oh . . . . (groans) he's breastfed" ?	Can you believe this was said to me by a consultant cardiologist today?      I took my son for an appointment and during his heart scan he started to get a bit wriggly - not fretful - quite the opposite, he was vert good, but he was making the Dr's job harder.      Bearing in mind this guy is a pediatric cardiologist I was quite surprised when he tutted & said, "look just give him a bottle" I said "I'm sorry?" he said "you know, a bottle? A dummy? I can't do the scan if he's doing this."      I told him we had neither and he groaned "oh, he's breastfed, well a toy? some food? just distract him will you?" He said all of this very impatiently.      I thought to myself - hey - you know what - he's 7mos old, you have 3 probes with wires on and a scanning probe in his reach - what you think he's gonna do? FFS       Like a bottle or a dummy would have helped anyway - bloody moron.

20090305093629AAnoawf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is there something wrong with me?	I have always had irregular periods. I didn't get my period until I was 15, and ever since, I've had 3 maybe 4 periods a year. (I'm 24 now) For the longest time, I thought I couldn't get pregnant, but I did have my 1st baby last year. She is eight months old. Since she's been born, I've had 2 periods. The first was about 2 months ago, and it only lasted 3 days. The most recent was Feb.6th, and it lasted 5 days. I definitely want more kids, but I don't want another 4 or more years to go by without getting pregnant. I want my kids to be close in age like my sisters and I. (All 2 years apart.) Any tips, advice, or experiences? Thank you!      P.S. I asked in other part of this section with not much luck...
20090305092934AAolECL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How many of you have had red spotting/light bleeding during early pregnancy & no cramps?	Hello to all and thank you for reading this and replying with your own experiences that are closely related to my own.   I had a bit of bleeding (red) this morning (wet on half a reg. lightday and it was accompanied with a few dark, small clots. I have had no pain (only worries!) I feel a bit faint or lightheaded sometimes but not for long periods of times. I have read in my "What to Expect when Expecting" book that both red spotting and dizzy/lightheadedness are usually normal for early pregnancy, and that 1 in 5 women red spot for a few days or weeks and the majority carry on fine pregnancies. I am comforted by reading that information but I was wondering how many of you have had red spotting, light amounts during early pregnancy (and were fine)? I am actually almost 7 weeks. I have my first ultrasound on the 18th and I cannot wait to see in there and be assured that my pregnancy is healthy and the heart is beating.

20090305100033AAxgBKm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	A question about grandparetns/parents/babies?	My brother is married to this woman and they have a 1 year old baby, and this woman hates our parents because they hardly ever come see the baby.  Isn't it kind of an unwritten rule that they are supposed to bring the baby to see the grandparents?  That's how it was when I was growing up.  I can probably count the number of times my grandparents came over our house when we were growing up.   Our parents would take us over there and we would all visit.  Also, our parents have very conflicting schedules so they are almost never off at the same time, so they can't just load up and drive the hour and half long drive.  Another thing, they never ever get out of the house.  The only time they do is when they go to work or the grocery store.  It would be one thing if they went out together all the time, and never dropped by to see the baby, but that's not the case.  Can someone help me out here?  Keep in mind my brother's wife is exceptionally rude and disrespectful, for instance, when my grandmother passed away, she just dropped my brother off at the funeral home for the viewing while she drove around in circles until he was done.

I had my little boy over a year ago and it seems like 2 or 3 period after having him I always feel pregnant around that time of the month! I get lower back pain, nauseous, I get really hot at time...just like I did when I was newly pregnant! I used to freak out and think I might actually be pregnant the first couple of times it happened but now I'm kind of used to it. I don't know if it has anything to do with my birth control or not. I'm on Mirena and have been since May and I like it! So have any of you moms ever had this problem?

20090305102110AA5UQAY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Has anyone experienced  this with their child's Kindergarten Teacher?	My son is in Kindergarten and recently his teacher claims that he is violent, she ever tried to accuse his biological father of abuse, but the problem is my son has no history of violent behavior and he never acts this way at home, in Sunday school, at the park, or anywhere else but in this classroom. Today when I droped him off two little boys began teasing him, they did this in front of the teacher, she said nothing, but when I tried to bring it to her attention she really had not time for me. I don't understand how she can accuse my ex of something terrible but not recognize the behavior is coming from her classroom. How do I deal with a teacher like this without looking like a crazy mother? (which she has labeled me, and anyone that does not agree with her) She claims to have 35 years of teaching experience so how can she let this go on and ignore it?

If I did get my period it should be on Feb 26th.       How long should I wait to take another test? I am most likely to buy the digital pregnancy if I’m going to try it again.

I want to wait at least 2 more weeks just to see if I'm going to have my period if not then I will take a trip to visit the doctor.      I had never had a child, so I really don't know what to do.

20090305095130AAZ4lQ6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Did you ever make your newborn wait to eat?	I was watching "Bringing Home Baby" on the Discovery Health Channel and there were these new parents on there, they both looked at least in their thirties and had just had a little girl.  It was their first night at home and the baby was crying.  They changed her diaper, rocked her, offered her the pacifier, and then the one said "Why don't you feed her?  I think she is hungry."      That is what I was thinking too cause the little time frame at the bottom said almost an hour had passed and they couldn't get this baby back to sleep, but the other woman says, "No, she needs to wait at least 2 hours between feedings."      Like thirty minutes later she gives in and feeds the baby and the baby is content and goes to sleep for another hour.      I never made my baby wait for food, she kind of agitated me when she said that.  I was like, you shouldn't make your newborn wait to eat.  I guess it was pregnancy hormones but it irked me.
20090305092412AAaHBr7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Thinking about changing my name?	I've been thinking about changing my name for quite some time, partly because I don't like my name (Victoria), and partly because I want a gender neutral one, since I don't quite see myself as 100% girl.      Now I've found out that the name Louis is gender neutral in Sweden (where I live), and I've also found the name Armande (also a female name)      I'm thinking of taking those names, but make people pronounce them "Louie Armand" instead. Yeah, kinda because I like those two characters in Vamp Chron *blushes*      What do you think? Is it an ugly name? Should I keep Victoria instead?

20090305100009AATdeTy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Why does it hurt when my baby is in this area of my uterus?	I'm currently 29 weeks pregnant and my baby seems to favour being up in the right side of my uterus... or just on the right side in general.   I wouldn't mind really, except it can really hurt sometimes when it hangs out in the upper part! It's just a constant dull pain that tingles sometimes, and gets really bad when I sit. I massage it sometimes to try and get the baby to move away from there.      Other notes of importance:   My midwives said my baby was breech when they felt it.   The baby has also been moving a lot lately.   Sometimes when I massage over it I can feel the baby and I can feel that I've pushed it away... sometimes it feels like maybe an arm or leg, and sometime a round head or something.       Does this happen to anyone else? Why does it hurt just in that area?   Could there be something wrong with that area of my uterus?   Why would the baby favour it on the right side?   Would me pushing lightly and massaging that area to move it out of there hurt my baby?      It's just sometimes it's so uncomfortable, but I don't want to hurt my baby! I know I asked a lot of questions... This is just my first pregnancy and I'm a worrier!      Thanks in advance for any information.

20090305101616AADR7YR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How likely is it she is pregnant?	Basically my friend got sexually harassed at a party a few days ago. The guy tried to finger her with possible precum on his hand. She was on her period (towards the end though) and had a tampon in. He might have got some precum onto the outside of her vagina although she is not certain. I just feel really sorry for her as it was against her will and now she is worried by possible pregnancy? Also she does not want to report the harassment, but I can see how worried she is by it all. How can I support her?

I was 39 weeks 5 days when my water broke and I just went to the hospital and gave birth 17 hours later.       This time around I have no idea what to expect, (as do we all). I don't know when I should be getting contractions for the first time (if my water doesn't break first).       I know I should call the doctor when they are 4- 5 minutes apart, but what week should I expect to start getting them? I'm 31 weeks now.

I spotted once in the am and once in the pm.    I spotted again only in the am on 3-1 with some cm.      Last night i got some bright red blood, when I wiped, and had every time I go to the bathroom and it is a fair amount, but there is nothing on my pad.       I had the mirena IUD out in October 08. Has anyone had one and had very irregular periods like this.       My husband and I are trying to have a baby and have pretty much has sex every day or every other.

Then Jan. cycle was 35 and now if this is my period it was like a 41 day cycle. What in the heck is wrong with me. My doctor only tells me to test, hasn't said anything about the long cycles. Should I just make an appointment and make him see. or should I go back on bc to see if that helps.

20090305052746AAUKLmA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	What do you do when your son's teacher dislikes him?	My son went to a local school for his kindergarten year no problem well liked. For his first grade year we moved into the city limits and he now goes to a city school. First grade no problem well liked, happy, has friends, teacher loves him. Same school for second grade, and totally the opposite is happening. My son's teacher says he is disruptive, disturbed, and needs to be on ADHD meds for his problems. She puts him in detention almost every other day. At home my child is normal typical boy. I can't even have a job this teacher calls me two to three times a week to tell me she can't stand my child and that if I don't have something done about him that she is turning me in to social services. Well from here I put him into counceling. But this teacher is still calling and still writing letter to the councelors to have him put on meds. So my questions what should I do? Should I ask for him to be put into a different second grade, maybe him and the teacher don't mesh. Should I report her?

My stepdaughter, whom my husband had no seen in 10 years & my brother’s daughter that we had not seen in 9 years, both who moved away & we did not know where.    Anyway, I found all three on Myspace, after searching over & over every so often. We are now in contact with my stepdaughter & niece.   Of course, then I tried to contact the daughter I gave up for adoption when I was 16, (she is now 17). I found my her, but was not sure it was her (I only had a county, first name & age). I found a girl who resembled me…& asked to be her friend on Myspace. I said in the request, My name is ****, and if that means something great, but if not, sorry for the intrusion.    She accepted. The adoptive family has my name & pictures of me, I was supposed to keep contact but when I was 19, but my letters to the social worker all came back. When I was able to see her profile, I seen a lot of pics & knew for sure. Anyway, I finally got up nerve & messaged her that I knew it was really her & that I was happy, but in no hurry to rush things. We could take all the time she wanted. I was not very specific, I thought she knew who I was because all her other Myspace friends are teenagers & stuff, in her town. I am out of state. Why would she accept me?   She replied, umm what, I’m confused. Well, I said nevermind, thought you were someone else, and she said   I’M Sorry”........ we have messaged back & forth since, but only   smalltalk. I do not know what to do. Does she know? I know for sure it is her now because she put her birthdate on her profile. Should I say something about it, do you thinks she knows & is not ready?   My sister all added her & she accepted her as well.      I am sorry this is so lengthy, but there are so many details that I could not leave out.

Hi everyone,   Went to visit midwife this afternoon. Last weeks appointment my baby was 2/5 engaged, and this really lifted my spirits. I showed at todays appointment hoping for baby to be fully engaged and ready to arive!   My baby is lying in a back to back position with me which the midwife said could be contributing to my really terrible back pain. I find it impossible to sleep and turning over is completely impossible!   Midwife said its noting to be concerned about and left it at thet!   Like I said, last week I was 2/5 engaged, today it turns out I am 4/5 engaged.   Can anyone advise? Does the fact that the baby is lifting out of the pelvis further mean I have longer to wait for labor to arrive, will I be able to go into labor naturally or will I likely need to be induced?? Is it true that if the baby doesnt change position, that labor will likely be more painful?      Sorry there are so many questions. Thanks in advance for all your help and advice. I hope I have explained myself properly. Really getting me down now :(

20090305100352AAJWDEn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Getting my daughter baptized...?	i would like to get my 1 year old daughter baptised along with her new baby sister (due in may). however, my catholic church is making it extremely difficult...last year i talked to the pastor, and he said i had to be attending regularly (i had just joined at that point) and giving my donation envelopes as proof. so, i have been going every sunday and donating as "proof". now i have to take a class this week, and upon talking to him again, he has said that both godparents "have" to be catholic, either with this church or have a letter from their pastor as proof. im at a loss, i am the only practicing catholic i know (and again, just got back into the church recently, about a year)...i just feel like there has been a years worth of obstacles, and all i want to do is get my kids baptised!       anyone else experience this with a catholic church? is there a way i can get them baptised in a nondenominational church, but still attend my catholic church? im so confused....i thought churches were supposed to welcome everyone?
20090305100357AAiTtDy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Could I be pregnant from pre-***?	A couple of days a go me and my boyfriend had sex without a condom (he refuses to wear one so I gave up trying to make him!) and he penetrated me and kept it in for about 5 mins then took it out to *** through a *******. He didn't urinate at all (I heard this can kill any sperm that may be there) just wiped his penis with tissue. But we did it again about 15 mins later and he penetrated me for a lot longer this time and i remember i looking down and seeing a lot of pre-*** coming from his penis but he put it in me before i had chance to stop him. Now im really worried i may be pregnant. I normally have quite a short cycle 20-25 days and it was day 11 when this happened. Does anyone know if there is any chance I could be pregnant? Im really worried because im 16 and my parents would kill me.

20090305100735AAHBeLU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Worried, about pregnancy?	Just found out last night that my girlfriend tested positive for pregnancy on one of those take home pregnancy tests.  First, let me say that I am not worried that we are pregnant, because this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with.  I am worried because we have been drinking for quite a bit the past 2 months, and she has been taking the pill up until yesterday(when we found out).  She also had her period around february 23rd, so i am wondering if this test is even right.  WE do have an appointment with her obgyn on saturday, but i just can't stop thinking about it.  I'm worried about the health of the baby and if there are going to be any complications.  We weren't planning on having a baby yet, so this is a surprise to us.  We are happy, just worried.

20090305101020AAkN8oB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possibility of being pregnant?	I am currently due for my period..I am about 2 days late. I just had unprotected sex YESTERDAY.       What is the likelihood on becoming pregnant? I should be getting my period any day now. I should have already started, in fact. But, I had some stressful events this month....I haven't had any other incidents of unprotected sex this month.      I went and bought some "Plan B"...but, I am afraid that if the egg has already been fertilized that I would be potentially "killing" a baby. I am very pro-life..and I can't live with the moral implications of "Plan B" if there is that possibility of having a fertilized egg.      I am pretty sure I am not fertile right now..since technically I should be bleeding..      I guess my question would be is how likely is it that I will get pregnant from this incident?
20090305101122AAlua6l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Why have I been cramping for 3-4 weeks?	First, I have PCOS, I know that cramping and pelvic pain are symptoms, or complications from PCOS ... but this long?      I had my last period January 9th. Since then I have been having terrible pain and cramping. at first I thought that I was pregnant, because my period never started, but then I had one or two days of light spotting about a week after my period was due. But the cramping just kept on. Sometimes the pain is dull but sometimes it is a stabbing pain. I am feeling sick, having back pain and sore breasts, but still no period. I have taken HPTs and all are negative.      I haven't been to the doctor because we have a 400 dollar deductible that hasn't been met, and I can't afford to pay it.      Has anyone been through anything similar, please help.... I can't keep self medicating with Ibuprofin

20090305101834AALZWPf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Spotting one week before my period, is it normal or could I be pregnant?	I'm on the pill and know when I'm supposed to get my period. Since I take my pill before going to bed, I've been taking it at different times this month because I don't always go to bed at the same time. I'd guess I've been taking them within a 4 hour window at times.      About a week ago I started spotting and have been everyday since. That's never happened before. Yesterday I was supposed to get my period and it was barely anything when normally it's a good amount of blood. I usually get cramps the day before and the day of my period and I haven't had any, just some discomfort, bloating and a headache. Which are all normal symptoms I always get. I know it might still be too early to show up on a pregnancy test but I took one this morning anyway and it turned up negative.      Is spotting for a week before my period normal or could I possibly be pregnant?

20090305101952AAiM7nS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Infertility, what is causing mine?	Okay I am 27years old 5ft 5 and 200lbs. I only became this heavy after I had my son 7 years ago, when he was born I weighed in at 150, and no matter what I did the weight did not come off. Anyway here I am 7 years later and desperate to have a baby, I go to the doctor next week. My symptoms go like this I have a "period" around the 20-25th of the month but it is BAD heavy bleeding, lots of clotting and lots of pain, bad mood swings, severely hormonal. Around the 10th-15th of the month I have something that could best be described as a severe cramp, no bleeding, just extreme pain. I am scared my mother had a hysterectomy at 32 because of endometriosis. I so badly want another baby does anyone out there have any suggestions for me?

20090227071213AAXhP6H	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pain in my back where epidural was... Kind of long?	Okay so I had my baby boy on february 10th at 9bs 13 oz!!  I was talked in to having an epidural by my husband and my nurse.  I didn't really want one as I didn't with my first (I did have an IV medicine which made me feel HORRIBLE) so I wanted to go natural this time around.  I was being induced with pitocin and the contractions were tolerable even after my water was broken, but the nurse kept telling me that if I wanted one I should get it before I was too uncompfortable and my husband nted me to get one because of the pain I was in before... he didn't want to see me like that again.  So I got suckered and got the epidural.  The anesthesiologist actually had to do it three times because the first two times he couldn't get the medicine in.  The first time he did it I felt this shock go through my lower half into both of my legs and that was so freaking scary because I jumped and the nurse and dr where yelling don't move!  Any so finally I got to relax and I didn't get too much medcine because he didn't know if any went in the prior two times so I still felt a little.  Anyway I know have this pain where it was and I only feel it if I have my arms up messing with my hair or like when I am stretching.  Do you think this is because of them trying it so many times or is it normal to feel this pain and how long does it last.  Today the pain isn't as bad as it was yesterday so I'm hoping it's getting better.  I am kind of glad I got the epidural aso because once I got it I progressed  super fast and actually I wanted more medicine because the pain was really bad at 7cm and the dr came in gave me more than like 3 mins later the babys head was starting to crown and my midwife had to rush around getting ready because he was coming!  He came out with like 5 good pushes in 5 mins so I think the epidural did help with that, but I don't want to feel this pain for the rest of my life!  Sorry this is so long!!

20090305092401AA0vYJk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Need to know that I made the right decision...?	I have been breastfeeding my son exclusively since he was born.  He is now 9 months old.  Our pediatrician at the last appointment had us cut out a breastfeeding and replace it with a meal of solids (that was at his 6 month) and he also wanted him eating solids three times a day.      At his nine month appointment a few days ago, he said that he wants him down to three breastfeedings a day with 4-5 meals of solids spaced throughout the day.      I chose to eliminate the bottle that I pump for him at lunch for several reasons.  1)  My husband says that he is losing interest in the bottle, and drinks it reluctantly and it takes him forever to finish it, though he still nurses the breast enthusiastically.  2)  I have had a horrible time pumping due to issues with let-down and the fact that I only have 25 minutes in which to pump and eat lunch.  3)  If we have to eliminate one of the four he still gets, I DO NOT want to give up my 6 AM nurse or my nighttime nurse.        BUT, I feel guilty.  I know I made the right decision to quit pumping.  No more parts to wash and sterilize, I get to eat lunch again, I can stop being a social recluse at work, hubby has no problem with giving him real food, plus it is what our pediatrician recommends.  But I still feel guilty.      So could some of you give me a little encouragement that I have done the right thing?  My breasts feel pretty full right now (it is almost the time I would have pumped), but I think I can make it to this afternoon to wake him up from his nap for a nurse.      Help me feel better about it?

Ok so my last period (big disappointment) i thought  last month was my month, but it came on FEB 4th through about the 11th I did the BD on the 11th 13th 16th 20th on the 23rd which was this monday I started having some spotting it was brown at first with like a string red discharge and turned into a maroon like a mixture of brown with red and ended in jus light pink (watery) with slight cramping but NOTHING like my period,my period isnt due untill after wed of next week, so what can this be? Implantation bleeding? or 2 periods in one month? which could be more common? Bc I've been having me period since I was in 5th grade (11yrs old) and NEVER have I had a double period. I know my last period the one on the 4th-11th was regular it came on time so what is this spotting I just had? bc i didnt even need to wear a pad or tampon it was just when i wiped. I have a daughter already and I didn't have implantation bleeding with her but i know every pregnancy is different and I'm just wondering what could this spotting have been? How does implantation bleeding end? in light pink or brown or red? Please don't tell me I might have an infection bc i know that's the not case.

20090227071752AAmXzvY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Toddler shyness ..........?	I started taking my daughter to toddler group when she was 18 months old. The first time we went she ran off and played happily not really caring where i was as long as i was.   The 2nd time we went she was tired so wanted to be with me the whole time.     She's now 20/21 months old and (we have missed a few toddler groups) and still wants to be with me when we go there.    I'm wondering what's going on. My thoughts are, is she actually shy? because when i sit with her at the playdo table for example and another toddler comes over, she will say "hiya" to the boy or girl but they ignore her. So she is trying to talk to the other children.    Also, some of the kids snatch her toys off her. She is a laid back girl so she doesn't cry or moan but i wonder if this plays a role.   Also, the time we go is right when she has her nap so she is always tired there but i have to take her because she needs to get used to other children. So does this play a role?      She is very loved and I instill confidence in her so much so that she's very independent and very happy.      Any ideas what's going on here?

20090305101300AA1OrcS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Suggestions on when to take a test?	I will be 22 in a couple weeks and I have always had a very regular period except for when I was on the birth control patch. Once I got off of that my periods went right back to being every 27-28 days. I've been off of any bc since last August. Once I got off it I was very diligent about charting my cycles and whatnot, my bf and I weren't really planning on having a baby, but we are ready to have one if it comes about. I was mainly charting my cycles so I know when my periods should start so I will at least know right away if we do get pregnant.       Anyway, my chart estimated that I o'ed Feb 22, this cycle started on the 9th. But I sometimes get o pains and I did this time, and it was a couple days before my estimated ovulation. So I am pretty sure I o'ed on the 20th. We did have sex right around that time, I think that day actually. If I did indeed ovulate on the 20th, I would be 13 dpo. My period is slotted to start on Sunday. On March 3rd (cd 23/11 dpo) I woke up to find that I was spotting. I have never spotted before a period, it was a very, very light brownish pinkish color. No smell and was not painful. I was spotting just a tad bit today as well. I'm assuming it's too early for symptoms if I am pregnant, but I've been cramping a lot and I don't usually do that before a period either. I've lucked out and don't ever get too many pms symptoms. My lower back and side has been constantly achy for about a week and I've been feeling bloated pretty much all week too.       I'm not asking if you think I'm pregnant, no one can answer that, I want to know when I should take a pregnancy test. Is 11-13 dpo (depending on when I o'ed) too early? My period is due on Sunday, so should I just wait until then? Or go ahead and test?

20090227070422AAuO41u	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Disturbing Sleep Issue With 19 Month Old Baby?	OK - Let me first start by saying we have a kid that has had sleep issues since he was born.  To some they may not seem so unusual, while to others I am sure they would be seen as quite disturbing.  For the first 13 months of his life, he had nights where he would get up 3,4 times...He would be up a few minutes or so, and then get back to sleep...Those were the VERY BEST nights....The ones that were NOT good ranged from waking 5-10 times per night to many nights where he simply would not sleep.  Often times we would spend MORE time trying to get him to take his nap then how long the nap itself would actually last.  To get him to sleep at night was like struggling with a wild animal.  Often times it took hours of him turning and shifting himself around before he would finally sleep in her arms so she could transfer him (at which point we only had about a 50% chance of getting him into his crib asleep).  If he was up three hours later, we considered ourselves lucky.      For the first 13 months of this life, he had two nights where he actually got 7 consecutive hours of sleep, and these were miracles to us.  The first time this happened, we both LEAPED from our bed, ran into his room, and checked to see if he was still alive.  These two incidents were amazing to us...Seven hours seemed like 24....So, at 13 months we did what we never wanted to do.  We let him cry it out.  Took three weeks, but it worked.  From months 13 to about 15, he actually willingly went to his crib, and we were getting 10-11 straight hours MOST of the time.  Other times he would be up a couple of times, but he would PUT HIMSELF back to sleep.  Then from 16 months or so on, it seemed to regress, but not out of control.      OK - So, now at around 18 months it completely falls apart again.  Nothing works.  He just cries and cries.  We read about the 18 month regression, we try many things.  Out of desperation to get my wife enough sleep to function like a normal human being we give him to my Mom for a night.  Poor Mom...Right?  Well, NO...He sleeps GREAT.  So we think...OK - Coincidence.  Two more times over the past two weeks we do it again with incredible results.  He sleeps PERFECT over there (okay, the middle night of the three he got up twice, but come on, that is nothing compared to what we are going through here at home)...So he is PERFECT.  Here it is horrible.  Same routine...Same temp...Same everything.  Not his teeth....He DEFIES sleep.  She goes in there and tries to tell him he needs to sleep, rubs his back, does not engage him.  She sits on the floor....He tries to then sleep STANDING up....The ultimate defiance in trying to sleep.  At my Mom's, no such struggle.      Gotta throw one more thing in here.  His behavior with us is absolutely the WORST.  He throws things, slaps my wife, and is generally so unruly it is like something out of a freakshow.  As soon as we are around others, or just give him to my Mom, he is PERFECT.  Even when WE are around him WITH my MOM or others, he is so MUCH more well behaved it is startling.        The sleep issue...The behavior....I do not know...But I can tell you that it really disturbs us that he is bad enough with us that we think he has some REALLY serious sleep issues, only to prove that he CAN sleep, and so there is not some Weird Strange thing that he has that no one else has.  Yes my Mom is great with him, and yes she is Grandma, but the behavior he exhibits is like Two completely different kids.      Anyone else experience this and know what to do...The sleep thing is the worst because it really drives my wife into the ground (if I try anything, he is even more despondent since I am not Mommy)...      Yes, we have somewhat of a routine - He eats well, gets a bath, has milk - All before his sleep, not too far before...My Mom pretty much does the same thing.  Don;t suggest white noise or other gimicky things...We have tried them all, to absolutely no avail whatesoever.      Anyone?  Why would he be SO different in behavior and sleep in these two environments.  my wife is not a pushover...We don't let him get away with stuff...We discipline him properly (in my opinion), never EVER using physical force, but using a strong voice, and looking straight into his eyes.
