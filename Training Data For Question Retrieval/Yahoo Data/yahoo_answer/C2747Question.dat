20090129083855AAwcUDt	Pets;Other - Pets	I am thinking of getting a house rabbit...?	but I'm worried that it will chew on wires/furniture/skirting boards/etc as I would allow it roam the house. Can you train rabbits to not chew on the aforementioned items.     I used to have rabbits a few years back, but back then I was living in a house with a garden so the rabbits stayed out in the garden.    Although I now live in a flat with no private garden, it does have a large communal garden which I would use to walk the rabbit on a regular basis.

We managed to get him house trained but about a month ago he started chewing huge holes in my cushions and pulling all the stuffing out! One day we came home to find the entire side of our love seat torn off and the loveseat drug about 6 feet from where we keep it!!! He has also started digging huge holes in the back yard! We got a cratye to put him in when we are gone and it seemed to work for a while then he started doing chewing the couches when we are in another room, like putting my son to sleep!.  He has a ton of chew toys and has already his adault teeth in. I don't understand. I really love him and don't want to get rid of him because he is really good with my 2 yr old and is a big LOVE but I can't afford to keep replacing furniture. I'm afraid we will have to get rid of him. If you know something that might work please fill me in! Thanx!

20090129084240AA4VxQJ	Pets;Dogs	How big can I expect this puppy to get?	We have a 14 week old Plott Hound/Labrador Retriever mix we rescued when she was 8 weeks from a shelter. She is 19 lbs. right now. How big can we expect her to get at full size?    We have heard conflicting "formulas" from people and various vets that say doubling the size at 14 weeks is their full weight (approx.). Others have said 6 months. Others have said 8 months.  Any input?    Thanks! We are just curious, we thought she was going to be a pretty large dog but the vet said she won't probably be as big as we thought originally...    Here she is:     http://i176.photobucket.com/albums/w180/...    Thanks in advance!

20090129084939AA3Q6oF	Pets;Dogs	How do I break my dog of a habit?	My dog has developed a new behavior this winter. It isn't bad or naughty, but just slightly annoying.    We've had A LOT of snow this winter and the temperatures have been as cold as -20 here.  When the snow is up to her armpits or the temperatures are bitter cold, she wouldn't go to the bathroom in our backyard.      We have a huge fenced in deck, so she would either go down 2 steps to the other level of the deck or to the concrete pool deck to relieve herself.  For whatever reason, she wouldn't go through the gate to the backyard during extreme cold or very deep snow.  And yes, we even shovel a path for her.  It isn't like the temps are any warmer or the snow less deep on the deck than in the yard...but to her there was some distinction. Whatever.    To stop her from going to the bathroom on the deck, we would give her a command to go into the backyard when she would start going towards the other part of the deck.  And then she would go into the yard.  She stopped using the second deck or the pool deck as her winter bathroom. Yay!    Well...now this has created a new behavior in her.  When I let her out, she'll take 3 steps and then stop and look back at the house towards me.  She won't go the rest of the way into the backyard unless I command her.  Frequently, I will have to take a couple of steps out onto the deck to issue the command.  Then she'll go to the backyard, do her business and play with her canine brother.    If I don't take a few steps forward to issue the command, she will go to the other side of the gate, pause, turn around and come back to the house. And if I ignore her and go back into the house, she'll just turn back and sit at the door without going to the bathroom.  And she'll stay sitting at the door until I let her in.  This dog can hold her bladder and colon!    Like I said...it's not naughty, just annoying.  Right now, I keep a pair of slippers next to the door.    I am soooo ready for spring.    So...how do I break my dog out of a habit when giving her a voice command reinforces the habit and ignoring the behavior results in her not relieving herself?

20090129085235AAidJzh	Pets;Dogs	What do i do with my dog?	We got a black lab a little while ago.  Her name is Savannah and she is only a puppy-probably about 6 months old?    We designated a spot for her to use the bathroom (we live in the country and have lots of land so it doesn't REALLY matter, but we try to have her go in a discreet place) and we would go with her over there with her and she'd do her business.  Now we've been letting her go out on her own.  the problem? she will stay out there for half an hour or more, beg to come inside, come in the house, and 5 minutes later, pee on the floor.   we tell her "no" and "bad girl" and put her back outside after this and clean it up, but it keeps happening.  it's very frustrating and can be embarrassing when we need dog sitters or we have company over.    we don't really know what to do. any suggestions? any idea why she's doing this?       also, she's actually my brothers dog and she is VERY attached to him.  where he goes she follows.  if he leaves, she sits and whines.  when he's not around at night she's impossible to deal with - she's up whining and barking about every 2 hours..  separation anxiety??

If he is eating and she comes near him he will move and give her his bowl. Is that ok? Sometimes she is laying and he will jump on her and grab her neck trying to dominate her. Is that because he wants to take over or is he establishing? When they play it then gets out of hand. I do say.."HEY" and they stop but then they are at it Again playful then too far. Who should I punish? When we go for walks she sometimes starts biting him when they see another dog. She is dog friendly. Is it because she feeds of his energy? He is a lil antsy. Is she trying to tell him to stop? Or what?

She's still really spunky and loves to play. We noticed that today also her brother has diarrhea. Anyone know what could be going on? A flu, maybe? The vet told us to feed her Chicken and minute Rice, so that's what we're doing.
20090129090751AAo2jQg	Pets;Dogs	Does this give you a feeling of ?	I just watched this on Yahoo News and I was really taken, almost to tears.  It really gave me a good feeling towards humanity and that there are still many, many good people in this world.  I was also reminded of how bad this economy is, think of the child with his dog and having to give him up because he couldn't eat, probably not able to understand completely why his parents were throwing his dog out.  To me, the dog look like he's a Pitt Bull mix (Of course they don't say that) but I think to anyone who watches that video that is so *against* Pitt Bulls they will recognize that is really looks like a mix of one and  perhaps even see that this hungry, cold, scared dog didn't lash out but is instead incredibly friendly and well behaved.      Do you guys feel it looks a lot like a Pitt Bull and perhaps they said "Boxer" to mask that?  Perhaps they said "Boxer" because they don't really want people taking in stray Pitt Bulls from the street?  How did this video make you feel?          http://cosmos.bcst.yahoo.com/up/player/p... 
20090129090638AABMpHE	Pets;Dogs	Your opinion on the adoption policies of rescues?	I am just curious about how people feel about the adoption policies of many rescues.  They often have policies requiring vet references, personal references, home visits, proof of veterinary records for current animals, etc.  Some also have requirements about the type of food you feed the dog after you adopt it, requirements to return the dog if you can no longer keep it, and provisions for regular updates on the status of the dog.      I am not stating a position on this policies (although I have volunteered with many shelters and rescues and support helping homeless animals).  I would just like to know your opinions on these practices, and how you think they can be improved.      I will be starting my own rescue in the next 2 years, and value the input of others.      Thank you!

20090129091518AAepIzg	Pets;Dogs	Help w/ dog who sheds and itches ALOT!?	I have a 2 yr old German Shepherd, Rottweiler & Shar Pei mix dog. VERY CUTE! But, he has always had a sensitive stomach, so we've had to use Eukanuba for germ. shep. for about 20 mths now. It keeps him from puking/diarrhea, but he has skin issues. We do have medicated shampoo for him. I know Germ Shepard can shed alot, but he sheds excessively. I can honestly vacuum 2x day and there is still hair all over. He also gets dry patches on his stomach and itches them alot, causing some sores/scabs. He just recently developed a big blackish scab on his neck. Its higher up, so he can't reach it with his mouth or paws, so I don't know how it got there. Is all of the related, shedding, itching, dry skin? I don't know if its from food or just sensitive skin. Would ANYTHING eliminate the ridiculous amount of shedding? He isn't allowed in bedrooms or on furniture, but it is all still covered in dog hair. Our couch has hair all over it and I have to brush it off and vacuum it also. His hair is just everywhere and its actually frustrating me...so I need to know if its normal or something wrong. I don't want to have him continue on as is, if its actually something wrong with him.

20090129101428AAdaWBb	Pets;Dogs	Kind of a morbid question but....?	Have you thought about what you will do when your pet passes on? I have a Catahoula that is 9yrs old, and i know their average lifespan is around 13-15yrs. i've been considering some options when the time comes. i don't want to be caught by surprise and be left wondering what to do, i know that sounds morbid, but years ago i had a foster pup who we adopted and he ended up having severe hip dysplasia. the vet said they looked like hips on a dog well into his teens. he was only 6mths old. he was humanely euthanized, but because of our circumstances (living on a military base) we could not bury him at home. leaving us to the mercy of friends w/backyards and big hearts. he was buried under the rose bush in my best friends backyard.    that really got me thinking about our future pets. i have arranged for a cremation and burial at a local pet cemetery for my dogs.   i was wondering if anyone else had given this serious thought (morbid as it might be) to prepare for a safe place for your beloved pet to reside after they pass?

My boy toy poodle will not leave my little girl toy poodle alone. They've been mating for 3 days now.  It's a very graphic scene!      It is very likely that she gets pregnant.      Wanted to know what signs will tell me that she is pregnant and how long will they take to appear?      Also, how long will she be pregnant for? (she's a small toy poodle)
20090129111321AAli7ok	Pets;Dogs	How do I stop the anxiety?	My dog is about three years old now. I got her from a shelter about two years ago and recently (the past 6 months) I cant even go to the garage and back without her crying and scratching the door. She also scratches at the window if anyone from the family is outside. It is the worst with my mom and me. We have tried to reassure her and have tried a few tricks to help her...such as not opening the door until she is calm or not walking in the door until she has calmed down..and I don't like the idea of treat training but we did try that.      I just don't know what else to do and Im afraid she is going to give herself a heart attack or something!!!

20090129101357AA1TbY0	Pets;Cats	How old is my cat, and is she a maine coone?	We adopted her from the spca as a short haired cat in April of 2008. The people who gave her up said she was 2 years old. The reason they gave her up is that they had too many cats. I found out from her file that she had kittens in February 2008. When we adopted her she was emaciated and tiny, she fit in my one hand, she weighed 4 lbs.   She needed a bunch of shots so we only had her spayed in June 2008.The vet said that her teeth were brand new, and that she could not be 2 yrs old. In July I went away on vacation, when I got back I was stunned! She was about twice the size that she was before, and had super duper long hair. Now she weighs about 8 lbs, but she is not chubby, she's pretty lean.   I think she might be a maine coone mix because she looks (and acts) like one and she has extra toes. But this makes it hard to figure out her age because their long fur comes in late, and Ive heard that it can shed & regrow after having kittens.   What do you think?

20090129112142AAT9aeI	Pets;Cats	My cat is lonely, but I can't adopt another pet. Solutions?	Due to work and school schedules, and the fact that she isn't allowed in our bedrooms when we're sleeping, my very sociable 7-month-old cat (who i adopted about a week ago) is left alone for 12 hours or more every day. Adopting another animal is not an option right now. She doesn't like any of her toys; the only thing she likes to play with are a piece of ribbon that we hold and run around with, and similar games that we play WITH her.      I can hear her meowing profusely whenever we leave the house and just before we enter. What can I do to make her less lonely? Advice please?

I feed them twice a day or so and normally I'm rushing out the door.  But I've noticed the heavier one will push the other out of the way to get to her food.  And he eats everything in front of him.  The skinnier one will just eat until she's full and leave the rest for later.  How, exactly, should I go about feeding them?  Do I need to separate them?  I want to avoid this if possible.  And should I take away the food that the smaller one doesn't finish?

20090225125430AADezIu	Pets;Dogs	Adopting an adult dog soon - what personality fits our pack?	I'm adopting a third dog in the next 6-8 months. I know the characteristics of the breeds; that's not the info I'm looking for. More individual personality stuff, like dogs that want to play versus dogs that are more serious, dogs that are natural alphas versus non-alphas, etc. Things that happen in every breed.      Guardians - we're a sit-on-the-couch-and-read family, not a go-for-runs-at-dawn family. My hubby, though a strong alpha, is more of a cuddler, and I like to wrestle with and chase my dogs. They come to me for playtime and him for leadership. But I still sit on the couch and read most of the time. I'm playfully lazy, or lazily playful.      "Princessy" lab mix - she thinks she is hot stuff. VERY well-behaved, very submissive, but she thinks she is "better" than most dogs. (Well, she is!) She's very smart and psychologically sensitive. Even though we got her as a very young puppy (8 weeks) at the shelter with her litter, and so there's no chance she was abused... she runs from the room if my hubby and I so much as have words about whether we put the tomatoes in the fridge or not. (No, tomatoes don't belong in the fridge!) Or if I'm stomping around mad because I can't find my keys. She gets upset whenever we're upset.      She's rather playful, and she used to want to play with every dog that she met. But since BOTH of her best friends from puppyhood's owners moved away, she's gotten a lot more reserved with new dogs and she's not as playful anymore. She is gentle with all animals, and kind of a pansy. She'll always run away from aggression.      "Jester" Aussie mix - She's the little tension-diffuser. She holds absolutely no grudges. She sticks up for herself and protects our princess dog, but won't hold anything against a dog that acts aggressive towards her after the spell is over. (Our "princess" will remember FOREVER!) She adapts automatically to any dog and what they want to do. That means that if a dog wants to play 24/7, she will play 24/7. If a dog wants to be an alpha, she'll be a beta, and if they want to be a beta, she'll be an alpha.      As you can imagine, that kind of getting-along-with-every- personality leaves my "Princess" dog out during canine social engagements. Jester will get down in the mud and play her heart out, but Princess wants to play, too... just not so hard. And of course, we don't want our dogs to play every waking moment of the day.       So what do you think?

20090128085640AA8nUst	Pets;Dogs	Cousin wants a Pit Bull, but is not equipped to ?	Ok, so ever since my cousin has saw my dog, he always says he wants a pit bull. He told me he thinks there cool and he wants to look cool owning one. Then his sister wants a German Shepherd and said she wants one because she thinks they're cute and cuddly.       I told my cousin that he shouldn't have a pit bull because he is NOT equipped to own such a breed that has alot of energy and power. I also told him that he has never owned a dog before in his life. He then claimed that his family had 2 dogs, but they got rid of them because they were pooping and peeing all over the place. I offered assistance to them and they kept trying to say they could do it, but eventually they gave up and just got rid of them.      I also told them that Pit Bulls need a strong leader who will be the leader and set rules and limitations which obviously they didn't with the other two small dogs they had. And when they did discipline the dogs, they hit them with a belt. Dogs, especially pit bulls, do not need that type of abuse and will result in dire consequences in the end.       I am baffled that he could even want a dog like that because he they didnt even know how to take care of their other dogs.       How can I get it threw his thick mind that he shouldn't own any dog, muchless a pit bull ?

20090129112647AAaiteW	Pets;Birds	Cockatiel Chick Question?	Hi    We have one breeding pair, and they laid six eggs. Three hatched, and they are five, three, and one day old. The problem is, that the parents leave for ten to twenty minutes at a time!    I only have one breeding pair now, so I can't get a foster pair. But they are pretty still, they could be sleeping, but... They are still getting fed and all, but the parents are leaving for too long. This is their second time, and they were very good parents on their first try!    I'm going to hold them to see if they are alive and in good health, but I think they may just be sleepy, or something. There are three of them, and we are expecting three more.     And I was thinking, if I had to do something such as hand feed, how would I do so at such an early age? The youngest I ever did was a week old. Is there anyway to make them go in there more? How can I get them to take better care of their babies? I am building a home-made brooder and am about to go get the formula.
20090128094622AAoHy83	Pets;Dogs	My dogs sick and I'm tired of doing the laundry!? might be a TMI?	Yes! This is not a rant.   She's thrown up 5 times in the past two days. (Four times yesterday and once so far today.) She threw up on the couch's yesterday and I had to take ALL the covers off the cushions and wash them and the blankets and sleeping bag. THEN this morning she started gagging on the couch and so I pushed her onto the floor--thank god we have hard wood--and threw up there.       YESTERDAY- her throw up was yellow and chunky and it also looked goopy on some parts. Made me gag. *shivers down my spine*      TODAY- She threw up and it was chunky again and it was like the color of split pea soup. Sorry for the food analogy but thats the closest thing I've could find that it looked like.       We have a cat but she doesn't get into the cat litter OR the cats food. Cat food is up high and she doesn't go in my room. either her or the cat got in the garbage but she's not one who would get in the garbage so I think that was the cat.    She hasn't eaten anything but her food and even if her food is in her bowl she hardly even eats that. We feed her twice a day. I'm worried about her. I got a sample of todays puke for the vet and I'm trying to get a poop sample as well but ugh I'm so tired.       Has anyone ever experienced this with their dog?   What has your vet said?   Thanks   She goes to the vet at 11:30.
20090128094701AABrbXC	Pets;Dogs	My dogs sick and I'm tired of doing the laundry!? might be a TMI?	Yes! This is not a rant.  She's thrown up 5 times in the past two days. (Four times yesterday and once so far today.) She threw up on the couch's yesterday and I had to take ALL the covers off the cushions and wash them and the blankets and sleeping bag. THEN this morning she started gagging on the couch and so I pushed her onto the floor--thank god we have hard wood--and threw up there.     YESTERDAY- her throw up was yellow and chunky and it also looked goopy on some parts. Made me gag. *shivers down my spine*    TODAY- She threw up and it was chunky again and it was like the color of split pea soup.

20090128090306AAxhNVA	Pets;Other - Pets	My hermit crabs are still buried under the substrate!?	it's been almost the 4th week now that 2 of my hermit crabs were buried under the substrate, and i originally thought they were  molting, but then yesterday, for the first time, i saw 1 of them come out, didn't look new or anything(not fuzzy, color was same), went to the fresh water bowl, stayed for like 5 min, than went right back down his hole again. so now i know hes not molting.   I flattened the area where he first dug down (4 weeks ago), and it was still flattened up until he finally came out to drink, so im sure he never came outside until yesterday. So what exatcly was it doing under the sand for 4 weeks if not molting????      could it be de-stressing? i didnt know they stayed under for that long just to destress...

20090225114505AALixJ3	Pets;Dogs	It seems lately everything escalates into a fight between them.....whats going on and how to fix it?	Its very rare that they snuggle one another or nuzzle or show any real signs of affection but it happens but it doesn't last long.      I have a female 1 year old Jack Russell mix and a Male 1 year old minature poodle.   (Male is neutered and female is spayed)      It all starts off as play I think....but then it escalates to growling and jumping at each other...it usually starts by one or the other nipping the other ones back leg.      Our JRT mix will nip at our poodles feet but he will actually bite at her....but he doesn't leave any marks......he did bite her once and it left a mark on her shoulder.      And then I get on to them and I seperate them and after awhile they are the best of friends again....but this is happening all too often.      Normally our poodle will start it....he will go up to our JRT mix and start humping her or nipping at her.....and she will walk away and he just gets more persistent.      Our JRT mix will not bite our poodle though....she just wont so that is good.   She is bigger and stronger than our poodle.      By the end of the day they are all happy, cuddly, and nuzzly or they are sitting at seperate ends of the apartment....depends on if they've made up. and depends on the day.         They both can get pretty jealous at times.      What is causing this?      Are the fighting?      Are they just playing rough?      How do I fix this.....my  methods of separation don't always seem to be enough.      I want to understand the behavior

20090128094100AAxeMEk	Pets;Cats	Change in cat behavior (sorry it is long...)?	Hello!  I have 2 cats. one i have had for about 13 years or so.(we'll just call him big kitty) the other one we have had for a little over a year. (we'll call her little kitty)    ok,   big kitty is male and is fixed.  little kitty is female and is not fixed yet. (getting it done with our next paychecks. - have not had the money until now to do it unfortunately)     When we first got little kitty it took about a month or so for them to warm up to each other. but after about a month they were like best friends. they would eat together, sleep together, play together and groom each other. we lived in a small apartment and they were both indoors only.    we just moved into a house. big kitty is allowed to go outside and roam since he is fixed. since little kitty is not fixed she is not allowed outside.  (she has escaped twice and we could not get her. so i hope she is not pregnant. she didn't show any signs of when shes in heat when she escaped. - and if she is pregnant i have no idea what to even look for...)    anyway, like i said before they were all buddy buddy and lovey dovey etc... Now all of a sudden (like in the last 2 weeks or so - which is around the time she escaped the second time....) big kitty has been acting different toward her. anytime she gets near him he swats at her and hisses at her. he has booted her out of a few spots she was sitting in and then sat there himself. when big kitty is eating, little kitty just sits and waits for him to be done and then she will eat. and if she is eating big kitty will just boot her out and start eating, leaving her to wait some more. i put food in seperate bowls which seems to help but she is still weary when he is around her eating so she stops.. and waits..    any ideas why the sudden change? Do you think it will help when i get her fixed?

My female was in heat about  2 weeks ago.  It seemed to be a very short heat cycle and it was her first cycle because she’s only a year. Well my male shih tzu has always tried to hump her and she refused but just near the end of her  very short cycle she finally allowed him to do so. They locked on February 8th and then they locked again the very next day! It’s been 2 weeks since the mating occurred. My female dog has been looking like she’s putting on weight and her nipples are bigger and there is a lump underneath them. I’ve been calling the vet and doing as much research as possible about pregnancy and dogs because I plan to have a career in the veterinarian field. I’m just a little confused about her being pregnant or experiencing a false pregnancy. It’s only been 2 weeks. Is it too soon for signs like bigger nipples, sleeping a lot, laziness, and slightly bigger belly? Please answer this and tell me what you guys think. Thank you so much!!

20090128091539AAL2UQu	Pets;Cats	What to do about neighbour's cat?	Last night I went up the street to one of my neighbours houses, and his front yard and porch are not very well lit. It was fairly cold out, and I was only wearing a sweatshirt, so I was jogging. Somehow just as I was getting to the porch I felted something under my foot, and heard a loud screach.      Apparently it was his cat. I wasn't sure of what I should do, I certainly didn't want him to answer the door with me clutching his dead cat. I put it under the porch, and jogged back to my own house.      Now I dont know what to do. It has been snowing all day, so my footprints should be covered, and I could probably get away with this for the rest of winter, but what about come spring, when the cat thaws out? If it were in good condition, he might believe that it had just frozen to death, but it's fairly flattened in the middle, so I'm afraid it might be obvious.       What should I do?

In the house it is the same if we try and bath her or brush her, she'll run and whine. Even with visitors in her own home, she'll bark and run backwards.

Then last night when we got home my mom (who lives next door) had found the cat.  He appeared to have been dumped in either oil or was secreting something. I am not real sure being i didn't find him. The thing is both times the animals have gotten sick no one was home here or at my mothers.  So just want to know what someone might be using as my parents have 1cat and 1dog and i have 1cat left and 1 dog. They all are in the same pen together.  Oh yeah and when the cat died last night he looked like he was soaked again and we had him dry about an hour before. thanks

A great deal of media attention is centred on the price tag attached to the cloned Labrador puppy Lancelot.      However, the original Lancelot died on cancer, so wouldn't the clone be predisposed to develop cancer?      Money aside, do you think it's right to clone a dog, if the original dog died of an illness like cancer?

20090128094846AAfbUV5	Pets;Dogs	What do you think about this dog owner?	I was at the checkout at petsmart with my 2 little 7 lb dogs sitting in heel position at my side.  I felt a presence and looked down and 1 foot away from my dogs was a huge pitbull leaning toward my dogs.  The woman holding it asked if it could smell my dogs.  I felt it was looking a little too intensely at my dogs and I didn't know the dog or owner so I said no.  I found out a couple of minutes later that the dog was there for training because of dog aggression.  It did not show aggression toward my dogs, but I observed it growling at other dogs even some as small as mine, to the point where the Petsmart trainer took control over it to correct it.        I do applaud this woman for getting help for her dog, but I am quite upset at this woman for allowing her dog with its history to come up behind me and for even considering asking me to let it "sniff" my tiny little dogs.  Without even telling me it's issues no less.        I do let my dogs play with bigger dogs if I know them so it is not that I am over protective.  They even have a couple of pitbull friends so it is not the breed.        My question.  am I over reacting?  Should I have told her something?  What would you have done?

20090128110607AAfrUFQ	Pets;Horses	Please  help my horse and Me!?	I got my horse nearly 2 years ago(it will be 2 in August) and we are having some serious problems. The first month was perfect! Then in September, she started to act up, and I got scared. Thinking back, I wish I could have fixed her problem then and I regret that. She started to stop at the gate, pin her ears back and back up. Now, it is much worse. Now, she'll start to buck. Bucking doesn't scare me so much, but it's more of the fact that I feel like I don't really have a nice riding mount. I know that she is good, because with others, she is great. I personally think that it is me that she seriously dislikes and I really want to fix that. If not, I think that I may have to sell, and I really don't want to do that. So my question is; how can I gain her respect and feel like we're getting somewhere without feeling timid (whenever she does something like buck I freeze up and get REALLY tense)? Also, how can we rebuild our relationship? I regret that I can only ride her on the weekends and sometimes only once a week, but it's time that we turn this around. Unfortunately, I just had jaw surgery, and I cannot ride for a long while, but I will still be allowed to go and see her(brush her, etc.). ! I'll be FOREVER greatful! . She is a 15hh, Bay, Quarab Mare. I also forgot to mention, that she gets really bad whenever I try to tack her up(she'll bite, kick,etc). Thanks again!      Also, whenever I try to correct her, she'll back up, pin her ears back, and buck/kick. SHe is just as defiant as I am, but i am not sure if we are compatable.    So my question is; how can I gain her respect and feel like we're getting somewhere without feeling timid (whenever she does something like buck I freeze up and get REALLY tense)? Also, how can we rebuild our relationship?

I just recently purchased a pitbull puppy its not really what I wanted but it was my next choice I wanted a dogue de bordeaux a.k.a french mastiff man I love those dogs but anyways back to my question I know a couple of guys who have told me that if you feed a pitbull what horses eat and I forgot the name of the product it will make the dog a little more cockier and bigger and I also know a pitbull breeder who has fed his puppies it and they look really really good they have a real nice size to them my question is can feeding a dog what horses eat make them bigger with more size to them I had a red nose before Hurricane Katrina took his life but he was a monster what I mean by that is he was a real big dog so I named him Terror he didn't live up to his name because he was a gentle giant but since he became apart of the family we loved him anyway but I just fed him pedigree and treats like bacon strips the regular way u would feed a dog with ordinary dog food on a scheduel I'm from New Orleans but when I came to Houston that's when I heard about how a dog gets bigger when u feed him what horses eat. I was really curious to know if this is true or not because don't get me wrong I like the slim sporty look of a pitbull but I really like cockier ones like the ones u see coming up the street and u be like man thats a big healthy dog.         To anybody who answers my question first off I am not and I repeat I am not a dog fighter pitbulls already have a bad rep so why should I make it worst I love them a lot I have had a couple of pitbulls and have been complimented on how they look numerous of ocasions from just regular people to cops they are loyal dogs that need a chance its not the dog that's bad its the person that makes them bad and I think that a person that fights dogs should get the same penalty as of killing a human being it should be no less.

20090128112216AAkxbXF	Pets;Rodents	Can anyone help me tell whether or not my mouse is pregnant?	So, about 2 weeks ago I went to the pet store to buy some mice for my boa constrictor. [I usually buy two at a time.] I tried to feed my snake, but she didn't seem to be hungry and wouldn't eat. So, I set up a cage and put the two mice in with some bird seed and a water dish. [I've cared for mice before, and I know how to care for them.] Sometime during the next week, I noticed that the idiots at the pet store had given me a male and a female mouse. They were in the same cage together for maybe a week or a few days longer. While they were together, they made a nest out of some newspaper and toilet paper I put in the cage and built it under a house sort of thing. When they weren't in the nest, they followed each other around the cage, ate together, and did everything together. Then, one day, my mom fed the male to the snake. [I didn't know she was feeding her.] And lately it seems like the female [who I'm waiting to see if she gives birth before feeding her to my snake] has gotten fatter. I don't know if she's just fat, pregnant, or if it's just my mind playing tricks. She spends most of her time hiding in the nest she built, and doesn't enjoy being handled. I don't know much about breeding mice, but I've made arrangements to care for the babies if she is pregnant, and everything will be taken care of. I have a few pictures of the female here, [she's a pretty small mouse to begin with] and I was wondering if anyone would help me to be able to tell if she's pregnant or not. If she is, and wasn't pregnant before we bought her I would imagine she would be anywhere from 1-2 weeks pregnant.     http://s633.photobucket.com/albums/uu56/...    -    http://s633.photobucket.com/albums/uu56/...    -    http://s633.photobucket.com/albums/uu56/...    -   Thanks a lot for your help, and time reading that long *** paragraph up there. ^_^

20090128100631AA0t9pX	Pets;Cats	What to do with a problem cat?	My girlfriend and i have a cat named Kitty. She's adorable, as most cats are. However, she has a few quirks about her that drive us crazy. For example, if i leave a beverage of any sort sitting around, it's inevitable that she will find it and purposely knock it over. If we leave the bathroom door open, she either unspools or shreds the toilet paper. She enjoys chewing on plastic and promptly throwing it up, as well as shredding the furniture instead of her scratching post. We have tried spraying her with water, using this spray from the pet store that supposedly makes her not scratch furniture, as well as a number of other methods. Is there such a thing as a cat whisperer?

I am so frustrated and angered by this situation and i went through alot of touble to find this nice woman and the only thing standing in my way is this stupid selfish owner who doesn't want to give up her dogs becuase she thinks, "if i cant have them, nobody can" how can i report her? what can i do to get the dogs to this woman who wants to take them from this abuser?! please help and i dont want people answering who only want points, i need real advice here. This is causing me so much stress right now and I need to find a solution fast! there are 2 puppies lives involved.

Where if you seperate them they will rear and buck in their stalls. I am also trying to train them how to ride they are both 8 years old. When i get on one of them it trots around fine and everything but when i get on the other one and kick it it just bucks and if you dont kick him he just stands there and doesn't move. I also want to be able to train them to ground tie.

20090128105824AALUTeJ	Pets;Cats	How do i tell if my cat is pregnant?? help!?	Hi ,    I have a kitten named  Nina.    She was born July 29 2008 , along with her brother Sylvester.   hey are going to get fixed sometime this month. Today my dad was looking at Nina and her mother Minnie. There breathing patterns seem to be different , as if Nina was pregnant. Could my kitten Nina be pregnant ? I looked for the nipples on Nina but , i could not find any.   It look es like something is kicking . But is this possible considered there ages so young?    All answerer's appreciated.
20090128110137AAeOZgS	Pets;Cats	I'm pretty sure my cat is pregnant! I don't know anything about it though.?	You see we just got these cats that were homeless. They're 8 months. One boy, one girl. They've never visited the vet before and don't have their shots, they're not fixed. We're very disappointed that the previous owners never did anything for them. It looks like they were abused over there because they're so skittish and don't seem to trust anyone.    So when we got them we noticed that her belly was sort of big, but we thought they were just a little overweight, even though she is really skinny in the rest of her body, but we thought nothing of it. Then yesterday while looking down at her we noticed that something was happening. She is very skinny, and then there's a bulge at her stomach. I researched it on the internet and looked at her nipples to find out they were very very pink. when we feel her stomach it is very tight, not flabby. Yet we can't feel anything move around in there. Yet we are positive she is pregnant.    So how do we find out what stage she's at, and we're also very scared because she is still very young at only 8 months so this might kill her. Yet we don't want to hurt the kittens. So what is the best way to handle this and find out what stage in pregnancy she is in?

20090128110557AA73gCX	Pets;Dogs	Pregnant dog bleeding when urinating!?	Hi all,      I posted a question on this earlier, I am looking for help again.      My Berner girl is 35 days pregnant and had bloody, watery discharge today after playing.       I rang the vet and they said it wasn't an emergency and to take her in the morning.      She has just been out for her walk and tried to urinate 6 times, but actually only passed urine twice. Once again there was watery blood, so am now worried about an infection. She also wet herself inside the house this morning which I am now thinking might be connected.      I have just called the vet again and they seemed to think I was over reacting and told me to calm down, give her plenty of water and wait until her appointment tomorrow.      I just feel like she needs to be seen now. I am just being paranoid? Should I try and find a vet who will see her now (emergency hours)?
20090128110808AAIxbcl	Pets;Cats	Why does my 16 month old cat look and sound like he is sucking.?	She hurt his paw somehow. It looks like a blister, but dry skin. That's not what I'm really worried about (she is walking on it but still limps) and is getting better. But I am concerned because since he hurt himself, he started a sucking behavior/ like a dry mouth thing or something stuck in his mouth. (i checked and didn't see anything). He meows more and is a bigger baby then he was before. His nose is running but he now has green slim coming from his eyes. I just don't know it his paw has something to do with the other. He is eating fine and drinking ok too......Please, any help would be great.
20090128110811AAYtP52	Pets;Cats	My oldest cat went crazy.....?	I have a kitten (7 months) who is quite mischievous - and last night she crawled up into my futon and got stuck.  When I went to turn the futon over to get her out, my oldest cat attacked me.  I can only think he was thinking I was hurting her because of the way she was crying, but what would cause him to go crazy over something like that?  He hoarded the kitten under my bed the rest of the night and would not come near me.  I'm worried about him....should I be or was he just being the "Protective alpha male?"  (And the kitten is a female - but let me reiterate she's quite mischievous!)        FYI.......He's 5 and I've had him since he was a kitten (along with another cat the same age.)  She will be getting fixed in two weeks.
