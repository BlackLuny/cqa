20090310030653AAiArZ0	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Should I get an HDTV or PC Monitor?	I'm deciding on what to purchase for my PC.  I have 2 choices: a PC monitor or an LCD HDTV.  Now, I'm leaning towards the tv because I want to opt to use it for gaming with my vg consoles (mainly my PS2). Only drawback is the price in which I can get a very good monitor.  Problem with that is that I have to get separate stuff in order to connect my PS2.  So, I need some input here.  Which would be a better buy?  Keep in mind, I'm only limiting myself to $300.  I know you have to pay for quality but I'm in need and I need to make up my mind by Saturday.

20090310030909AABiL2y	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Nintendo Wii	Nintendo wii - sound but no picture?	After having our wii for about 8 months it suddenly stopped working properly. It was working fine but now when we turn it on there is sound but no picture. Thought it could have been to do with the AV cables, however we tried it with another set of cables and it still didn't work. Have tried different tv's but still have the same problem. Took it to a games console technician and they told us that when they tried it on their tv they couldn't get a picture but when they tried it through their computer then everything worked properly. Unfortunately can't return the console as we no longer have the reciept (no idea what we have done with it).      Wondering if anyone out there would have any insight? We're all completely stumped

20090310042308AA8KjRK	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	I want to fit a covert voice recorder into my trouser belt. What electronics can you recommend for this?	I want to build a bugging device that I can attach to my trouser belt that will continuously record sound and save it to a memory chip.   So it needs to have the following components:      battery   memory chip (500Mb plus)   microphone   on-off switch      The idea is that when it is switched on it continuously records to a .wav file on the memory chip, and when it gets full it overwrites old data. So at any one time it will always have the last half an hour of sound. This could be done by having it create 10-minute wav files, and keeping only the last 10 on a rotating basis.   I must be able to remove the chip and download data.      The pupose is to record life as it happens on an everyday basis WITHOUT having to proactively press record to start recording.      I am looking for a Maplin style electronics solution for this question. Links would be useful too.      Thanks.

(bad luck/clumsy i know). the phone didnt get that wet. (dont ask why i was texting in the shower. ik its dumb but i'd never have dropped it if the battery wasn't lose in the first place.) i dried it off with a towel and it worked fine. well later that night it started having wierd glitches and the whole entire inside keypad didn't work and when i was texting the buttons would type all out of place. then when i woke up the phone was fine again. could it be good now? the little sticker inside my charger is pink, which im pretty sure means its water damaged but i dont know. it still works fine. i'm going to get a new charger but i dont want a new phone because they dont make the env anymore :[ ugh is there anyway i could get an env somehow? will they give it to me for $50 still if i dropped it in the shower? i dont want to tell my dad i was texting in the shower so i will just say that it was on the towel rack next to the shower and slipped in. but then again he knows i text in the shower and maybe he'd understand that this would have never happend if the battery wasn't lose. the phone isn't broken but i have OCD and im afraid i cant rely on it to work when i need it to? what are some techniques i can save it by? i heard putting it in rice... idk. thanks!

20090309132212AAIiB8o	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	Qwest ripped me off...?	I started service with Qwest 3 months ago. I got home phone, DSL and Directv services. When I called to start the service the sales lady told me I would get everything I wanted for 105 a month before taxes and other associated fees. She said my first bill would be $150 which it was and second would be the regular price of $105. Well I got my second bill and it was $210. She said that 3 months of internet would be free and 14.99 there after. She also said within a few months I would get $75 off my bill for signing up with them. So I went over this $210 dollar bill with the CSR and she said my internet was the highspeed platinum or something like that and that it was $25 a month with no months for free like they said when I signed up. She said that their slower internet package was 14.99 a month but that I had called and upgraded my service BUT even then if I had chose that package I wouldn't get it for three months free. Also the lady I signed up with told me my phone package would be 35.99 a month and they ended up charging me 45. So I went round and round with them on the phone and they said there was nothing that I could do because I ordered it on the phone and they don't specifically let you know what you're getting and the price. Oh and another screw over by Qwest is that the CSR told me that no where on my account did it say I was getting the $75 off my bill. I am so pissed not only because they screwed me like this but because I don't know what to do about it. I said I was going to cancel and they could careless. Any suggestions?

20090227144607AAgbWCB	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	What exactly is the deal with itunes plus?	Okay, this has been ticking me off for quite a while now. I have the "old" version of itunes and whenever I go to buy music anymore everything is always "itunes plus only."   There is hardly ever anything for me to buy....      Also all the news of itunes plus in my opinion has not been stated clearly. I have no clue why itunes plus is different... I also dont understand the whole "pay to upgrade" your music.... does that mean if i want to keep all of my music, yet still download itunes plus then i have to pay 30 cent for the 500+ songs I already have? Because I dont want to do that. I dont believe I should have to repay for something I have already bought just so i can buy music once again since all of it is being converted to itunes plus.       Can anyone confirm/clear any of this up for me?   I would greatly appreciate it.
