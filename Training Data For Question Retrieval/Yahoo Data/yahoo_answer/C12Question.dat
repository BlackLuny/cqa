When I was 17 I took a mock AsVab got placed as E class 3. Back then I wanted to be a doctor (had started my AS in Pre-med) but I switched about 2 yrs ago. Now 21 I hope to become a lawyer, practising international law . (But I'm not sure if what aspect of it is of more interest to me. Right now it's a toss among Treaties, Maritime and Aerospace Laws or Corporate).      To be honest I'd love to do both med and law but I'm not descplined enough. Which is the reason why I am considering the military in the first place. I know I need to focus and my ability to do so is getting worse.      By the way I'll probably graduate w/ a 3.0 or above and I happen to be a dual citizen (US born but lived outside the US [with my parents] till I was 17, parents are non-American and they like it that way).      What do you think are my chances for being accepted as an officer and for JAG?

I know we have become a more of a emperorership lately (mostly through Bush) but i hate it when other countries put the US down.      Lets look at some examples of things we've done.      In World War I, Germany still had a chance at winning and probably would have done so eventually if the US had not stepped in. It is said France and Britian (especially because of the naval blockade germany had put on them), were 1 month from defeat.       If that had happened we probably would never have had World War 2 because europe would be speaking german.      World War 2: we pretty much single handedly defeat Japan, and we come to Europescall for help again to stop Hitler. Rather or not britian could have held out forever and turned the tide,,,, who knows.      We won the cold war. Russia self destructed but we helped most of all countries.       And what do we get out of it? people love america so much that they want to destroy us because we have what they cant have.       pittifyull world.. I dont know

Pandorma   By:---         Chapter 1: The Beginning of the End      In the beginning, The Pandorma Initiative was a harmless group of scientist working to cure a new type of cancer that was killing thousands every day. The cancer was a communicable disease that could be transferred by blood or saliva. They quarantined the infected, and ran tests to try and save them.    The disease mutated and was no longer a cancer, it was a pandemic. The disease was named Tannic. Tannic became both a health and military hazard and was quickly spreading in South America where the quarantine base was stationed. America closed the boarder to Mexico with force of the entire Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, National Guard and Special Forces. The rule was “Killing on sight”. Mexico and the Mexicans in America were mad, the Mexican population rioted leaving most of America ruined and the Police were not the law any more. When Tannic finally came into the U.S.A, it was by boat from Cuba where no calls,

You miss several days due to illness, backed by doctor's notes and orders from more than one doctor.  The school teachers count these excused absences against your grade. You develop depression and consistently think of suicide soon after.    Question:  Did the school violate discrimination laws on basis of disability if the student's health condition was both something mental (e.g. depression) and a chronic condition (e.g. Mono)?    OR  Issue: Let's say you work as an Administrative Assistant at a health food store.  You miss several days due to illness, backed by doctor's notes and orders from more than one doctor.

Even though she graduated from High School, she never fails in doing what's wrong.  She doesn't steal or break the laws, she just needs a lot of help and she has a lot of idiosincracees.  For instance, she loves to stay out all night even though we tell her that that's not right.  She refuses to go to college even though we told her she'll have a hard time finding a job if she doesn't go.  Also, she refuses to eat in front of other people at home or in a restaurant.  She also never washes her clothes and her room and her pocketbook always looks a mess.  She also goes out in pajamous sometimes and takes 3 hours to get dressed.    She is not a person who should go to jail, nor is she a person who belongs in the crazy house.  She is a person who has a lot of problems and she needs someplace to go so she can be told what's right and wrong.  I try to tell her but it goes in one ear and out the other.

In our state, you HAVE to have a lawyer for a divorce and custody, unless you go to the courthouse and file together. He has no job, he is an alcoholic, he is bi-polar, and he's extremely violent.   He DID stop drinking for about a month and half, but three days ago, one of his friends bought him a case or two of beer. He's been drinking since. She will be staying with me when she comes back up here tomorrow, along with their two year old daughter.  He says that he will get full custody of their daughter. She is not an unfit mother and in fact is solely responsible for the kid's welfare, since all he does all day--and I'm not exaggerating--is drink and play Eleven on his computer. (He lives directly above me.) He is not actively searching for a job (his car never moves).  Will he get full cusody of his daughter? Or should my friend file for full custody based on the grounds that he is an unfit parent?
20070227043821AAjTwGZ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Inwiefern ist ein Rauchverbot gerechtfertigt und widerspricht es nicht der freien Marktwirtschaft?	Rauchen ist sch?dlich und deswegen m?chte man Nichtraucher davor schtzen. Ich verstehe auch das Verbot an ?ffentlichen Pl?tzen.  Restaurants, Bars und Clubs sind fr mich aber keine ?ffentlichen Pl?tze. Es gibt niemanden, der dazu gezwungen wird in einen Club zu gehen. Wenn so ein gro?es Bedrfnis an Nichtraucherclubs etc vorhanden ist, warum werden dann nicht mal welche aufgemacht? Nichtraucherrestaurants gibt es mitlerweile und sie laufen meist gut. Warum also gesetzlich erzwingen, was auch so m?glich ist? Und wenn es so nicht m?glich ist, dann scheint kein Bedarf zu bestehen. Ich verstehe nicht wie man ein legales Produkt an bestimmten Orten verbieten kann. Msste man dann nicht gleich Tabak in D verbieten? Was ich auch nicht verstehe, warum man dann noch nichtmal Raucherpartys machen kann, oder geht das? Wenns allgemein nicht erlaubt ist wohl eher nicht. Wie sieht das denn in Schottland und Co aus? Darf man dort Raucherpartys veranstalten? Ich f?nde das nur fair. (Bin Nichtraucher)

Habe einen Artikel darüber gelesen, der besagt, dass die Coffeeshopbesitzer ihren Handel sehr geheim halten. Ist der Handel also gar nicht wirklich legal, sondern wird lediglich geduldet? Und wie steht es mit dem Anbau? Ist es wirtschaftlich gesehen genauso einfach ein Marihuana-Gew?chshaus zu bauen wie ein Tulpengew?chshaus? Und der private Anbau, ist der legal? Wie genau sieht die Gesetzgebung aus?      Bitte keine Vermutungen, denn die habe ich schon genug angestellt.

Andererseits darf man Informationen verkaufen. zB.: Ich wei?, dass Politiker A mit Firma B illegale Gesch?fte macht. Der meistbietenden Zeitung verkaufe ich diese Informationen. Das ist dann OK, aber dem Politiker selbst darf man die Informationen nicht verkaufen, weil es dann Erpressung w?re und man sich damit strafbar macht. Ist das nicht Einschr?nkung der freien Marktwirtschaft? Auch w?re zB das eine Erpressung: Wenn wir heute Abend zusammen einen Video ausleihen, dann machen wir jetzt das worauf du lust hast. Aber das w?re wohl kaum strafbar. Wenn man jemandem etwas androht, wie zB wenn nicht..., dann schlage ich dich zusammen, dann ist es eindeutig, aber ansonsten?

Mas se o consideramos insignificante, só pagamos pouco, ou n?o pagamos nada por tal coisa. Isso é apenas razoável.   A puni??o pelo crime também tem sido, em geral, considerada desta forma. Sup?e-se que o criminoso “pague” por seu crime, na propor??o de sua gravidade, usualmente por meio de multa ou priva??o da liberdade. Este princípio era seguido ainda mais de perto na lei bíblica. Ela exigia que o criminoso compensasse quaisquer perdas reais, além de sofrer danos punitivos. O princípio do igual por igual estendia-se até mesmo ao homicídio. A lei de Deus exigia “vida por vida”   Hoje no Brasil se faz necessário que esse tema seja chacoalhado,esmiu?ado revirado, até que n?o sobre  duvidas se quer nas cabe?as das crian?as,me ajude a levantar essa discur??o.

20070321110819AAGBfA5	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	A company wants to dissolve voluntarily?	My former employer does not want to pay me the Employment Tribunal Award.  I am afraid that they might start to dissolve voluntarily. Also, the owner has about 15 more limited companies in addition to that one I worked for.  The claim to the ET was made against the company not the owner. So, if they dissolve it can I still get my money out of them? The law is on my site but they are doing everything not to pay the compensation. The brand and the name of the company matters to them a lot, so obviously after dissolving it they must continue its business as they make good profit out of their business. Is it possible the owner just dissolves it then buys it from another company's of his? Or, is it possible that his relative buys the company and then they will continue working under the original brand?       So, what can I do in order to receive the compensation if they start dissolving their company? What can be done? Thanking you

The election was monitered and certified by the Carter Center, the Organization of Latin American States, and the European Union. If that wasn't enough the opposition candidate Rosales admitted defeat. It must have been one of the most monitered elections in world history.

HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:      (AP) Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez holds a wide margin over his main challenger as he seeks a third term in Dec. 3 elections, according to an AP-Ipsos poll that also revealed many government opponents are worried they could face reprisals for how they vote.      About 59 percent of likely voters said they would vote for Chavez for a third term, while 27 percent said they would support opposition candidate Manuel Rosales. Thirteen percent of those surveyed by the polling firm Ipsos for The Associated Press said they were undecided or wouldn't answer.    http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/2...

I'll say at the outset I'm from the UK here, just to provide context, but other perspectives welcome:   When I listen to all the main parties talk about issues, there doesn't appear to be any huge ideological difference anymore, and the word socialism hangs in the air almost like a taboo, I was wondering if there was a true left-right divide anymore?   looking at the evidence, I propose an alternative mode of ideological situation:   The divide I propose is this: between the "Post war consensus" created by the Labour government of Clement Attlee, in which even subsequent Tory governments kept the steel works, coal mines, etc. in public hands. on the other side is the "post thatcher consensus" in which even a labour government believes market forces are the be all and end all, and has demonstrated a commitment to privatisation (eg school academies) , and recoils at the thought of nationalising anything, Northern Rock, for example, which was nationalised as a last resort   your thoughts?      I also state that my intent here is to debate the appropriateness of the traditional divide, and to examine the way in which today's parties all seem to be varying degrees of Thatcherism.    It is not my intent to start a debate about the relevant merits of parties      
20080928153205AAuooWD	Politics & Government;Politics	What do you think of this newspaper endorsing Obama which is their 1st Democratic pick for Pres. in 72 years?	The last time the Record of Stockton California endorsed a Democrat for President was in 1936 for Franklin Delano Roosevelt.       http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/a...       Barack Obama is our choice for president of the United States. He has demonstrated time and again he can think on his feet. More importantly, he has demonstrated he will think things through, seek advice and actually listen to it. Obama is a gifted speaker. But in addition to his smarts and energy, possibly his greatest gift is his ability to inspire.   ...   Unlike McCain, who is trying to position himself as a born-again regulator, Obama would increase the oversight of our markets and demand accountability. He would actually put regulators in the oversight agencies that were systematically dismantled by the Bush administration.   ...   Republicans have tried repeatedly to paint Obama as an elitist. Hardly. He grew up in a single-parent home and, by the sheer force of his desire and cerebral horsepower, ended up at Harvard Law School, where he became the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review. He could have gone for the money. He didn't. He went to Chicago, where he worked to give a voice to those who didn't have one. That's hardly the mark of an elitist.   ...   He offers hope. A new way of doing business. And a belief that our system of government can be made to work. He's the clear choice.

Some preliminary reports have come out about the future defense budgets. One alternative plan for next years budget calls to reduce troop levels in the Army and USMC.      The Army and USMC are both currently increasing its total force size. The USMC will reach its new mark this summer while the Army will reach its goals further down the road.      Why would anyone cut back on troops after just increasing them? This doesn't make any sense to me. We have worked so hard to reach these current levels which have helped in easing some of the strain on deployments and now the current administration plans to take them away, or part of them. Why?      From article..   "The alternative budget also proposes increasing enrollment fees and copayments for military retirees using the defense health care system and a reduction in Army and Marine Corps personnel."      Article..    http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/200...       And lets not forget Obama stated if elected he would like to increase the USMC to a larger force during his term.      Would he really cut back on troops or is this some sort of political mumbo jumbo?

As witness for my sister, Saw a lot of mexican women working through interpreters saying they were abused. They had free lawyers for them, and they won every case I saw. It was like all for the woman in that court. Some has US white men, some had mexican men. all were guilty. But it was funny about the white ones were that when the men were on the stand, soon as they started telling their side, did not matter.  Even if there were no pictures, bruises, hospital reports.  My question is know abuse happens but can this be a sackful way for a woman to get a visa without paying for it. 50B were thrown out and judges did say to some of the men I know you are not going to bother this woman but it is for a cool down.  But it looked like the court was full one way guilty until proven innocent. But i was thinking, can a Illegal set up a man for this and will it get investigated better by immigration instead or her word VS his.

Through considerable lobbying efforts in both the U.S. Congress and the U.K. Parliament, BP was able to persuade both governments that the future of their countries' oil supply demanded action in the Middle East.

20060920082213AA1s9Ok	Politics & Government;Politics	Does anybody have the accurate numbers of how many starving children living in the United States?	I help to operate a food pantry where we give food to people suffering from AIDS & HIV. We also give U.S.D.A. food out and of course U.S.D.A staples are available tro anyone that asks for them with a declaration that they fall into the Government income guidelines.    I attend bi-annual meetings at a food bank where we get our U.S.D.A. staples, and at one of the meetings we were informed that because of the Nation's crack-epidemic of the last 15 years, many of the babies were taken out of their mother's homes and placed in foster care where they were neglected and left to wander the streets. We were told that in most major cities there are thousands of young children that have fallen through the system and live on the streets. We were told that if a 6 year old comes in asking for food to give it to him or her. Considering this fact, I would like to know if anyone has accurate numbers of how many starving children live in the United States of America today?

Labor Secretary nominee Hilda Solis became the latest Cabinet nominee to face questions about unpaid taxes Thursday as a Senate panel abruptly postponed a scheduled vote on her confirmation. The postponement came after revelations that Solis' husband settled tax liens on his California auto repair business this week that had been outstanding for as long as 16 years.      The discovery posed another political headache for a White House already chafing after tax problems and other controversies derailed some administration appointments, including former Sen. Tom Daschle's nomination as health secretary. President Barack Obama pledged in TV interviews this week that he would "make sure that we're not screwing up again" in the vetting process.

Then I read all the comments on it. It was unbelevable that if somone commented that they didn't want Obama or that they don't like him. Someone would of course comment and say that their rasicst. Which is not true. I believe in the Rebulican view and I didn't want Obama nor do I like him. But that doesn't mean im rasicst it just means that I don't beleive in what he wants to do for this country. I would vote for a black person if they were running for the rebulicans. It isn't about race its just about my politcal views. I am not saying that everyone who didn't want Obama isn't racsist that's not what im saying man. But what I am saying is that that's not the reason as to why rebulicans didn't vote for him. So my question to you guys is what do you think about this? Also who did you want Obama or Mccain? And why? Just wandering.      oh and Ps: Im not mad that Obama won. I do think that it's cool to have a first black president. It is great to know that America has come such a long way.

The city is laying-off 15 cops (saving 60k each) the county is letting go 29 deputies (72K on avg each).      This is a HUGE savings to the Tax-Payers and will help our community to balance a shrinking budget.      Due to a population decrease over the past 10 years and a lower crime rate that mirrors that change....it is much needed!      The Other benefit: Less non-sense ticket!      If any of you have spent some time in your local traffic court as I have, you may notice these tickets are nothing but revenue enhancement.      Prime example: My daughter received a ticket over in Indiana 2 Months ago, she was doing 72 in a 65 and got dinged for $175. She just paid it.      but get this: She gets a letter from the State of Indiana saying that for $50 more they won't let tell her home State know so she won't get any points on her license.      Makes you wonder why they don't wear mask when they rob us like this.      The one benefit I can see is.......LESS tickets, that's money they can keep for their families, pay bills, buy groceries etc.      what other benefits can you think of?

You'd think that the nation with the highest spending capabilities, largest recruiting pool, and the most extensive experience in recent military history(US), would be the most likely candidate to have the greatest special operations group. Once again, this is not an argument, I'm just curious. Please avoid saying the training is more intense, because if the US wanted to make our Spec Ops guys better, they'd just make the training tougher, which they haven't, so...(circular argument). Above all else, DO NOT say that the SAS are the best because of the caliber of their men; assuming that the US doesn't have men of equal capability would insult both Americans and non-Americans.

You have got to be lucky to make $4 Billion killing on a 6-month investment of $124 Million Larry Silverstein is the New York property tycoon who purchased the entire WTC complex just 6 months prior to the 9/11 attacks. That was the first time in its 33-year history the complex had EVER changed ownership. Mr.     Silversteins first order of business as the new owner was to change the company responsible for the security of the complex. The new security company he hired was Securacom (now Stratasec). George W. Bush's brother, Marvin Bush, was on its board of directors, and Marvins cousin, Wirt Walker III, was its CEO. According to public records, not only did Securacom provide electronic security for the World Trade Center, it also covered Dulles International Airport and United Airlines, two key players in the 9/11 attacks.    The company was backed by an investment firm, the Kuwait-American Corp., also linked for many years to the Bush family. KuwAm has been linked to the Bush family financially since the Gulf War. One of its principals and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, Mishal Yousef Saud al Sabah, served on the board of Stratesec.    Follow the money.

Summer vacation is the one time in a child's life they have any freedom!    and it's not just taking away freedom from students.......  but Teachers too!   vacation time is their biggest perk!    Summer break allows students to get jobs, and have a social life.  It adds monumentally to the quality of life.    9 months a year in school is plenty of learning time!   plus they make students read books over the summer anyway.      In Ohio, schools budgets are as tight as ever......countless times, they are laying off teachers.    Strickland wants to keept the school open an extra 20 days during the Summer which would add astronomical air conditioning expenses.        Shame on Ted Strickland for imposing on summer vacation.           I used to like Ted Strickland.  He froze college tuition, and refused to hike taxes.   But now he has lost his mind.   And yet, his approval ratings are increasing.  They have increased from 54% to 63% recently.       The gullible public is buying right into his plans.    Remember the cartoon movie, "Recess?"   The secretary of education tried to take away summer vacation, and the whole public was up in arms and strongly opposed to him doing this.     Why can't the public in real life stand up to protect summer break?            Shame on Ted Strickalnd.

Under her proposal, illegal immigrants hoping to pay in-state tuition at a state college would have to attend a Rhode Island high school for three years and earn a diploma.

I cannot smoke inside.  We had a joint rolled and were about to smoke it.        It turns out one of my neighbors decided to call the police on us.    After a few conversations with the officer on site, my vehicle was searched.        In the end, I was charged with possession for an amount of approx.  less than a quarter of a gram of marijuana stems.  I was also charged with paraphernalia for possession of rolling papers.        This is my first offense.  Until that night, I had a perfectly clean record.      Your thoughts?

20090205150640AAXBcaD	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	PCSOs in London have more disciplinary actions against them?	Today I read PCSOs are bored and breach the code of conduct in the PCSO role. They are only a small percentage of the Met yet they take up about half of all disciplinary actions of all its officers. Most have been dismissed for gross misconduct. What do you think of PCSOs my thought are they are a waste of time and cost the tax payer as much as a Police officer who can make arrest and can do so much more then the limited role of a PCSO. There starting pay is ￡18,000 a year on top of that is weekend working allowances plus 14 or 22% shift allowance depending if they work after midnight seems a lot of money when we get very little in return.

I have no driving tickets or offenses at all and have no drugs or anything. so my background, so fa,r is completely clean. and I intend to keep it that way.      1.) Is it possible to hold a part-time job and go to Police Academy? If not, do you get paid at all while being in the academy?   2.) How tough is police academy? I can run a mile in 5 minutes and 20 seconds, I can easily do 100 pushups in under 2 mins, and can easily do 60 pushups in under 2 mins (I had been training for the Navy a while back.)   3.) Would a BA in Psychology be an acceptable degree?   4.) Should I take criminology classes even if Psych degree is ok?   5.) Around what grades do they accept? my last semester was a 3.6 GPA but it was my first college semester ever.   6.) Once I am an officer, would it be possible to still go to college classes?   7.) How hard are the written tests?   8.) How competitive is it usually to get in? And how hard would it be to get a department to pay for you through Academy?      As said, any answers would help!

20090205151407AAWCP6I	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Why would the government allow this to be shown publically via internet?	i just got done reading this book on onlinebooks.com. it was called the TM 31-210 Improvised Munitions Handbook, to sum it up its how to construct bombs like terrorist organizations use. it is U.S government issued, and yet the fact that we try to fight terrorist organizations that are domestic and foreign, we still allow books like this for sale and on the internet. worse you can view it for free on the internet. although it was made by our government and issued to some of our troops(i believe is true), is the federal government technically supporting or rather implementing the use of these bombs and other tricks for terrorist acts of violence on our home front. personally i find this disturbing and ironic.

I injured my knee in Sept 08' from a military related incident and had to get surgery in Oct 08'.  They pretty much took out a chunk of my right knee and is also pretty much worthless other than walking around.  I have constant pain when walking and it's rediculous going up and down stairs.  Running around is impossible as well.        It has been three months since the surgery and the doc is talking about putting me on the med board...then probably eventually the peb board.  I also told the doc about my other knee since I was with the main one...and he said that I just had some chondrlamalacia****(however u spell it) so it isnt too much of a big deal.      I was curious if they did end up discharging me...what would be a good approximate of the military percent rating...and then also I would like to know what the VA might percent me at.      Thanks
