Mj1IoGblaa	I understand what you are saying. You like yourself as a person so you can be social. However, you are afraid of failure, so every time you are going to make a fairly important decision, you are just not so sure. You choke because you hesitate.     This happens to a lot of adults. Maybe in the past, they got humiliated or embarrassed because of some failure, they just can't stop worrying about the consequence.    You know it takes some people their lifetime to master these things. The idea is that you don't think about the consequence. You just do your best and don't think about the result because it doesn't help thinking about it at all. And tell yourself that even if you don't get the great result, you will not die. Just keep going.|`|DxohE884aa	You're a great person - trust yourself! Why are other people more qualified to review your decisions - who knows more about your life than you? What's the worst that could happen - nothing you couldn't repair.  Good luck!|`|5ZkGgZWSaa	For most people this can be pretty normal. Even the most confident & snap decision people have doubts about what they are doing. Sometimes in life you can only learn through experience, it's not like been in a classroom you have to find out stuff by asking different people around you. This in my opinion is smart if you realise your perceived weakness.  Though more advice can be confusing you seem to be able to choose the right advice/criticism that helps you succeed.  Don't worry about it so much and try to increase the amount of decision making by yourself gradually, you WILL eventually take all the experiences you've learnt from & be able to make the right choices at the right time.  Good Luck|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Buy a pistol.  Right before making any decision, shoot someone.    Your confidence will go through the roof.|`|7eLFBoSOaa	I've got the same problem. I can't believe I can do something right.   I'm not the right person to advise you.  I just would like you to know you are not alone.     All the best.
3E9plH9Iaa	The reason is because there is no pressure on you to be anything more than if you were around another girl..Because their gay,,you don't have to be acting in a way to attract a romantic interest..Then too,,you are being seen by people with attractive guys,,and those people don't really know  how the guys really are..Its great to be friends with everyone,,and once you take the boyfriend ,,girlfriend pressure out of the mix,,you can relax,,and enjoy each others company and not worry about anything but having fun..The bad part about it is your repelling other fellows who might want to date or have a romantic relationship with you,,and possibly won't even attempt to approach you,,because of these outgoing and other attractive guys.I don't think its strange,,but its up to you and what YOU want to be portrayed to be !! You know,,most gay fellows,,mirror,,Feminine character traits,,so you WILL feel right at home with them !!  SOLOMON|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	I'm a straight guy, and I have wondered that to.

They usually have a lot in common with girls LoL They like to talk a lot and they are usually funnier than most straight guys, so its no wonder girls get attracted to them, and usually they are very style concious and dress well etc.,|`|uXQcDsiAaa	actually not. see, normal guys, like doing guystuff; gays like doing girl stuff. U being a girl is perfectly understandable to find guys who share the same interest as u do attractive.
CxoogGzxaa	It has more to do with the fact that your lucid dreams occur when you are taking a nap, rather than the ankles hanging over the edge of your bed, but I won't completely rule that out, either.     You are pretty much doing what lucid dreamers call "WBTB" (wake back to bed) where you stay up for an hour or so before going back to bed to have a lucid dream. Napping increases your chances of having a lucid dream quite a lot, and some swear by it.     Research has been done on this, read it here: http://www.lucidity.com/NL63.RU.Naps.htm...|`|J3k9WgzKaa	I believe that your body is always sensing where it is at, so as it feels you laying on the bed it allows you to have medium dreams.    Similar to the movie The Cell with Jeniffer Lopez where she is suspended in hair with cables as she goes into the lucid state.    The less your body is aware of its surroundings the more the dream feels real since it has nothing to compare against

They want to make friends and have companies.     It can be just just naive. They haven't met a lot of bad guys in their life, so they still like people.

eBMKmgCjaa	The whole idea that women have always been slaves to men is total BS and doesn't stand up to 30 seconds of non-hysterical thinking.     Men traditionally have:    1/ Had to go out to work in dangerous or stressful jobs e.g. coal mine.    2/ Been drafted to fight wars, unless already a professional soldier.    3/ Not had much chance to be with their children as they grow up.    4/ Emotions have been discouraged ('boys don't cry' etc) e.g. men can be shot for cowardice in wartime.    5/ Education for some in the privileged classes (exam pressure, 'exciting' library books etc)       Women have had to:    1/ Clean the home, which is repetitive, low skilled.    2/ Bring up the children. Taking care of infants can be stressful.    3/ Accept that expressing emotions is ok (e.g. cry etc) but not expressing opinions on politics etc    4/ Have had crafts (e.g. embroidery or music) instead of education.    Can it be so easily said that women have been slaves and men their oppressors? Or does it look more as if they both have roles that oppress them in different ways?|`|AA11530601	its not a belief its a fact that women were seen as inferior - in every way. Hence why they werent allowed to vote or go to uni - it would be too difficult for them to understand apparently and it wouldn't make for good housewives - so it was seen as strange for a woman to want to do that, even if she did, she wouldnt have been allowed.  are we really reaching that level of general ignoranace wherby even this is seen as a "myth" when there is evidence from as little as 30 yrs ago to back this up?    If you dont believe me then think about most other countries in this world - do ur research and you will see that women are not deemed capable enough to choose who they marry, have sex with or have kids with. If they refuse arranged marriage they often get murdered by their family or thrown out for bringing "shame" on the family name. Look around you, its not a matter of simply choosing to believe it when The Koran even has passages justifying domestic violence. A young girl of 13 was in the news recently, she was raped and then stoned to death for being a "whore" in somewhere like Pakistan. Woman hatred is alive and so is the idea that we are inferior and incapable of every skill that matters and just baby making machines. You dont have to choose to believe when the evidence is right infront of your eyes. Google "womens social status in 3rd world countries" and youll see what I mean.    Also, I agree with Doodlebug, we DO have roles that are separate and that oppress us - I am not saying its always men to always do the oppressing (although in some countries it is) but these roles we have are oppressive never the less are they not? that is why I am against forcing ppl to be a stereotype.|`|DxohE884aa	Sure.  But I still consider that fact to be true - I'd be surprised if anyone truly looked at the situation and believed differently.  Honestly, guys?|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	You can believe anything you want to, it doesn't make it right.  I may believe that spending $20 on a lottery ticket is worth it.  My believing it doesn't make it true.|`|2bO7iiZdaa	In theory, yes, but I don't see how you could believe something like that if you know how to read. Go to a library (or Wikipedia) and dig up some texts from, say, the eugenics movement or the church fathers. They had a lot of influence on society - and still do, in various ways - and they claimed women were inferior and had to be controlled.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I must say that I disagree; reason being is that feminism was built upon the principal that women in the past, as the feminists say, "Were highly oppressed." How, I have no idea; I don't believe they were. People lived their lives according to their customs and cultures. Yes, the life was rough and yes, the life was hard that's the way that it was. However, it is thoughts of "oppression", for one, that have spurned women to fight for economical, political and social equality with men.   Now I have a few discrepancies with the whole deal myself.  1. "Married women had no control of their earnings, inheritance, property..." http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...  However, "Colonial wives also benefited from antenuptial and postnuptial contracts. Antenuptial contracts  many of these appear in old court records  let a woman retain control over her own property." http://www.genealogymagazine.com/coloand...  2. "Husbands could legally beat their wives." http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...   However, "The colonies limited or outlawed physical abuse of wives. In 1641, for instance, Massachusetts prohibited wife beating unless it be in his own defense upon her assault. In the Southern colonies, laws prevented husband from inflicting death or permanent injury on their partners." http://www.genealogymagazine.com/coloand...  To go along with what I just said "wife-beaters could be punished with fines or whipping, and could also be subjected to public "shaming" in church or expelled from the congregation."  http://www.iwf.org/news/show/19011.html  3."Women were considered legally dead once they were married..."  http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...  So, if this were true I wonder why in the world did Thomas Jefferson ever bother with a lengthy and lavish shower of accoutrements and affections, in order to win Marthat Wayles over and married her on New Year's Day 1772? I mean why even bother to have a lavish wedding?   The wedding, held at the Wayles estate, The Forest, was presided over by a pair of Anglican priests, and followed up by a fortnight of revelry. http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/jeff... and why on earth was Jefferson so devoted to Martha, so much so that he tended at times to neglect his professional career in favor of domestic pleasures if he; for instance, thought of her as inferior? http://www.sparknotes.com/biography/jeff...  One would think there was no love in these marriages; that women were, too, inferior for that.   "MY MOST SWEET HUSBAND:How dearely welcome thy kinde letter was to me I am not able to expresse. The sweetnesse of it did much refresh me. What can be more pleasinge to a wife, than to heare of the welfayre of her best beloved, and how he is pleased with hir pore endevors.... I wish that I may be all-wayes pleasinge to thee, and that those comforts we have in each other may be dayly increced as far as they be pleasinge to God.... I will doe any service whearein I may please my good Husband. I confess I cannot doe ynough for thee...." This wife was how this wife responded to a letter of afffection to hser husband; he wrote to her; "My Dear Wife: Commend my Love to them all. I kisse & embrace thee, my deare wife, & all my children, & leave thee in His armes who is able to preserve you all, & to fulfill our joye in our happye meeting in His good time. Amen. Thy faithfull husband." And again just before leaving England he writes to her: "I must begin now to prepare thee for our long parting which growes very near. I know not how to deal with thee by arguments; for if thou wert as wise and patient as ever woman was, yet it must needs be a great trial to thee, and the greater because I am so dear to thee. That which I must chiefly look at in thee for thy ground of contentment is thy godliness."  http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15488/154...  Both men and women had great social pressure on them to marry. Young girls were often married by the age of 13 or 14 and if women werent married by the age of 25, it was socially humiliating. Marriage was mostly for economic benefits, not romantic situations. http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...  However, Marriage  As young men and women reached marriage age, which was commonly age 23 to 25..." http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_701509406...  In conclusion believe what you will, but don't be blindsided.|`|3d984205bb4d04e11f5941ec98252b01aa	The dynamics of being a feminist work this way: You believe that neither gender is superior to the other and that both should have legal equality THAT IS ENFORCED by the government.   Women in the past WERE considered inferior and were treated as such under the law. That is a historical fact. You can't disagree with it. Now whether or not you think that that was unethical will determine your stance on feminism.|`|anLdtPQwaa	Facts are facts. Women were less inferior to men BACK THEN. Of course you can still be a feminist and KNOW that!|`|zcPKjOnUaa	it depends on what perspective are u saying. Physically women are inferior than men, it's a fact. But in terms of social status, women and men were pretty much equal date back to hunter gathering time.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	It's not a matter of believing if women were treated as inferior in the past... it's a fact -- in most cases.

KjF0p72naa	Probably best to not let your emotions control you, but on the same level if you have alone time, it's good to release the toxins in your body if you need to cry, just do it. There is no shame in being real with yourself. Crying alone is no drama and it helps you feel much better because the release is more physical than emotional and can really take the "weight" off in a sense.    Also, if you continue please know it's not healthy. You should care about that and should also note that this type of behavior will not help you form compatible realtionships later on or will prove a hinderance.    So just let it go :)|`|N4A3pKStaa	Yes, your problems will build up inside and eventually come out. Instead of suppressing your bad emotions learn to deal with them effectively.|`|oD96O2ibaa	a medium is needed. Although you shouldn't cry over every little thing and suck it up, it's unhealthy to hold back tears when it's something serious.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	It depends on u. I have tried this also but I just exploded one day. It wasnt good.   Its best to tell ur feelings to a trused one. Even tho. I have trusted ppl around me, I didnt wanna stress  them out by telling them my problems.|`|lwc0n0zCaa	you will get really sick and eventually  you will breakdown and let it all out.  its happened to me.|`|0Cpqulbraa	very unhealthy. you can actually develop ulcers. your heart will be less healthy because you are stressed. let yourself be heard|`|ahBKJaVpaa	I had done this for a very long time.  It made me sick. I developed Irritated Bowel syndrome and I had to quit working. It really does help to get out what you feel. I am still working on this but, I am a little better than before. When you keep in what you feel you are not only making yourself sick but denying others on what you feel. It can hurt relationships and friendships. I have learned to become assertive and sometimes aggressive when I have to be. I have also learned to let go of things in my life.|`|69b929d341b49df84c23149c7790163faa	It's a bad thing to do. It becomes to easy to fast. After several years of doing this, you end up with major issues that need worked out in counseling. Also, if you hold your emotions in for a very long time, when emotions do try to come out in the future, you will be to afraid to let them. A fear controlled life is a very bound life|`|AA10008572	I had this early in life. You'll appear odd to everybody around. In happy times and sad. Eventually, you'll go through a major break down trigger usually by a death of someone close. It will be regret for not showing love while they were around. Further, you will have ongoing problems handling emotions due to stress. I'm no expert but it mostly happen to me due to child abuse and trying to show no emotion in public.
BNAzjSO1aa	I think that you need more help than you can get on this site. What I do know is you need to see your doctor again and discuss your medication  If you are really concerned and think the diagnosis is wrong try talking to him and if that does not work ask for a second opinion. If you are in the uk it might be worthwhile contacting the nhs direct helpline and seeing if the drugs you are on can cause the problems you are experiencing. Hope this helps a bit|`|pWlVHm6kaa	Honestly, I have no idea. Some of it sounds like a reaction to the medicine, the change in medicine, and the time of day that you take the medicines. It's a lot of medicine and the problems and your physiology is different than the next guys so that's another "who knows?"     What I can tell you is to be patient when you have had a change in the medicines that you take. It can take months to adjust. Taking medicine "as needed" can cause problems too. You know, most people have to try this and that until they feel better. It takes patience and time.     Years ago, when my mother was trying to get a diagnosis, the meds were awful. The side effects were worse than the illness. They did cause her to do things she wouldn't normally do and hear things she wouldn't have without the medicine so I don't doubt what you're saying. She stuck it out. Medicines got better. Much better. She became the amazing mother that I had always hoped for. I know you have family that cares about you too. Talk to them about what you're going through and get their opinions. They know you better than I do, for sure. Talk to your doctor and be patient. Ask all the questions you asked here. Don't give up.
B1yhdTrvaa	Sorry things are difficult for you. I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed. There are many good sources of help. Look at the video links.

Imagine if everything in your life was perfect.   I mean, it would nice four a few days, weeks...then it'll be boring.

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Nope.  Be happy that you are the way you are.  There are women your age who will spend their last $1000 on a bag instead of paying rent.  You seem to be responsible, which is always good, especially in a culture where stupid behavior is always rationalized by "Well, she's young".|`|BPZPxzBnaa	cool|`|NV3eIjLcaa	Women say this often. I'm curious as to what "mature" is meant to suggest when offered in this context. From what i've seen of studies it doesn't appear to be intelligence, occupational ability, willingness to sacrifice, dedication to social success, 'common sense', or altruism. I really don't understand exactly what it is that makes women feel that they are too mature, or more mature.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	"Can i be too mature?"    Only if your maturity leads to arrogance and self-righteousness.|`|FxAD44Moaa	hum,   actually that has nothing to do with maturity.      matter  of fact..     i rather say you were something different.      we all have to fend for ourselves..   doesn't take much maturity to accomplish that,  for instance.. but a sense and ability of sufficiency.    so,   shorten the legs of your high horse and start actually embracing a form of maturity.      i'm  sure the 27 year old would just love to  hear what you think of the poor devil,  i'm sure he'll not quite appreciate that criticism about him.|`|AA10889282	You had to be very responsible at a young age.

FTBiFqlXaa	To see people from your past in your dream, refers to your shadow and other unacknowledged aspects of yourself. It can represent a waking situation that is bringing out similar feelings as your past relationships.    To see people you don't know in your dream, denotes hidden aspects of yourself that you need to confront.    To dream that you are in pain, signifies that you are being too hard on yourself, especially if a situation was out of your control. It may also be a true reflection of real pain that exists somewhere in your body. Dreams can reveal and warn about health problems. Consider where the pain is for additional significance. If the pain is in your neck, then the dream may be a metaphor that you are literally being a "pain in the neck".    To dream that you have a crush on somebody, is a literal reflection of your attraction and fascination for that person. To see your crush in your dream, represents your current infatuation with him or her. If you find yourself thinking about him during the day, then it is understandable that his image will appear in your dream during the night. If you dream of your crush frequently, then your dream maybe be telling you that it is time to let this person know how you feel, especially if you are dreaming of him or her in a good way. Only good things can happen from you telling your crush. Even if he or she is not interested, at least you can move on and stop waiting time on him or her.    thats what this website says
J3k9WgzKaa	On a sliding scale being with the low economy there is a great demand, There is a lot of stress and depression about lack of employment and money without being able to pay for services because of the lack of employment and money.    Its a catch 22
J3k9WgzKaa	Seems to me like she wants you to mature very quickly and she wants you to do everything yourself but at the same time she is setting you up for failure.    Sounds like she was expecting you to fail and when you come out succeeding she makes it more difficult for you by dropping your allowed $$$
9fnbMzXnaa	I am so, so sorry that someone who is supposed to love you unconditionally is so cruel to you. I hate to hear of mom's being so focused on themselves that they don't nurture their children. Once you are a mom...it's not supposed to be about you anymore...it's supposed to be about making sure your children are happy and healthy.  My mom was the same way to me...so I understand your pain.  And one thing that always helped me was this...  If someone offers you a gift and you refuse to accept it, they still have it, and you don't. Right?  The same is true of verbal insults. Just leave them with her. When abusive words escape her cruel and bitter mouth  imagine them falling to the floor and shattering into a million pieces before they are able to get to your heart.  I know it sounds impossible to just "not let it get to you" but it IS possible.  It's your boundaries. People with healthy boundaries realize that what other people think about them is none of their business. Even parents.  Easier said than done when it's your mom, believe me I know. But you deserve to feel better, so do work at it.  Try researching emotional boundaries, martyrdom, and narcissistic behavior. Knowledge is power.  I really hope this helps and you will be in my prayers...really.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Write her a letter.  Even if she has emotional issues and is on medication, you can appeal to her human side. Say all the things you say in this question, but include not only HOW she makes you feel, but WHY... "when you say mean things it makes me sad BECAUSE  you're my mom and I love you and I want you to be proud of me."  Tell her you understand she has an illness and you want to be there for her, but it makes it very hard when she's always so mean. Regardless of her reaction to your letter, you remain calm, yet assertive - do not allow her to damage your self-esteem. You seem like a pretty together person, so I'm sure you understand that just because someone is a "mother" does not mean she's the best "parent". Good luck sweetheart  :-D|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours.

I know it does not help but it is true another thing to remember is you always hurt the ones you love, this is because they are more likely to forgive you. Is there any chance that you could go and stay with your dad or another relative for a while? just to give you a break and recharge your batteries so to speak. If not is there a teacher or counsellor at school you could talk to? Ithink you need to find some adult some where who you can talk to and go to for support with this problem please try to find some one, maybe even talk to a doctor about the problems. What I sense from reading your question is that you are a kind and considerate young lady who is trying hard to deal with a mom who is not only ill but nasty and ungrateful as well.

If you take regulation for one, some would argue that wall street and businesses in general have in fact had scores of regulation shoved down their thought, there are many special laws and regulations that both "wall streeters" and bankers have had to abide by for some time now- even though some people/ politicians  believe that now is the time to add regulations and that there wasn't enough previous regulations on banks and wall street.   If you want to look further into that position, you can check http://www.mises.org and they should have some relevant articles for you.|`|AA10719402	They would say that regulation and oversight in the financial industry should have never taken place.    Of course the counter to that is, "Well why are we just going to let them run rampant?"    Well, in true libertarian philosophy, those companies would have fallen on their a** by now there by creating enough moral hazard to make them veer from such risky behavior.      I think they would also say that the federal government is too big in general and dabbles in things that a national government has no right to mess with.  True libertarian means no legislation on social standards and all the effort going into such and such's political movement would be a waste of time.....    But I digress.  Libertarians simply would have said no regulation.. no safety net.    I personally think that for libertarian ideology to work, the law system really needs to be blind in order for everyone to have the same threats.
BhumxInEaa	Are you asking or telling?    Experience suggests that even if they could, most don't. Since it is in society's interest that they don't starve, etc. ...
BNAzjSO1aa	How can you talk to him?  What you need to tell him is he needs to tell his parents how he is feeling and explain how you would feel if he killed himself and how his family would feel, talk about anything you can think of things he will miss out on if he succeeds in killing himself. Is there no way you can find out his parents address would your parents know or another friend?  I would also suggest that you tell an adult your end about this problem they may have an idea that might be helpful. I wish you luck|`|pmav9Hehaa	dude...bummer!    1.ask him why  2.say thats nothing and try to tell him about worst experiences  3. if you have to resort to this than beg and plead and ask him not to kill himself...tell him hes your best friend and you would be no where without him( if you need to you can lie...thats probably better!)|`|ghHD4afhaa	Ok,first call the police.Then give his name and email.They will be able to track himk down and get him help real fast.If he has suiicidal thoughts again and complains call the cops again,they will bge so worried they"ll find him faster!ps:good luck!!|`|jJQqdfFcaa	show him all the reasons he should live = friends, family, etc. make him realize he doesnt have it so bad|`|7jp7sTdFaa	Call the police, you won't be able to talk him out of it, trust me.|`|fNfeYuyVaa	make sure you tell your friend how much he means to you and how sad you would be if something happened to him. maybe even stretch the truth a little bit if you need to.  good luck!|`|WbYkQudhaa	Tell him how much he means to you and that if he left you would be heartbroken. Let him know that he is very much loved by many people and if he left this world it would be hectic. Ask him why. Find out what it is that's brothering so much to a point that he would want to kill himself. Most importantly let him know how much he is needed.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I have a friend who is poor & I will talk to her on the phone & I go to youtube.com & we listen to music & comedians & I get her & me laughing so hard it is really healthy. Stay on the phone with him if you can just letting him know you need him to live cause he is your friend.
ZUL3drNgaa	i dream about random people who ive never even SEEN before. It's so weird, but its like i know that they have to be real people, i just dont know who.|`|fDElc7Qhaa	Mine are the same as Andie W  I have dreams about people, but I don't know who they are.|`|I6tnu09saa	Quite a lot. And in my dreams, he/she always seems to come back in another dream, but it's like three months later, and always gives me a creepy feeling of deja vu. Sorry if this hasn't helped at all.|`|BhQSTvLsaa	Yep. It's happened before.
ROdHsYVAaa	I blame the spice girls personally.    Somewhere in the early 90's "girl power" went from celebrating being a girl and equality with men to the spice girls... a whole generation of girls grew up seeing women like them and Brittney Spears, Christina Aguilara and Jessica Simpson flirt their way to the top shedding clothes all the way.  Smart girls were out, sluts were in.  And the parent's shamelessly indulged the whole Y-ner generation with whatever they wanted - if that was a new Brittney cd and a skimpy top, then they bought it.      Lol. And now, they can't seem to pay off those credit cards..... Basically, society as a whole over-indulged itself in every way possible, and is now paying for it with morgages it can't afford, and "role models" like the Pussycat Dolls.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	" Hot "  scantly clothed  chicks are a powerful force.|`|mCAWxobNaa	Modern Feminists confound empowerment with promiscuity.|`|AA11530601	yeah I know...does what the Pu*ssy cat dolls are saying mean that if you dont dress like that, then ur not empowered?  its just all nonsense they say that cause they know that sex is the biggest seller and they dress it up as feminism but it isnt.  I mean, if women have to look a certain way to be valued, then that runs contrary to equal opportunities. True feminism would be adoration without having to be sex symbol.|`|xCd7m5dkaa	"Dont you wish you girlfriend was hot like me."    I SAY-  I dont wish my girlfriend was a s*** like them. lalalala     Popstars can never be role models like the American media makes them look like.  They can earn alot of money but what they cant earn is respect and dignity.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Because it makes money. The message is that you have too look like you want it, but you can't actually want it. The media ideal is to achieve such a disconnect with your own sexuality that you have the ability to produce stiffies in any heterosexual man but the total inability to express yourself in such a way that actualizes your own goals and sexual individuality.    The Pussycat Doll ideal is the total sexual submission of women to men. You are "empowered" in so long as you are still attractive to men, but not demanding respect or equality to them. You can't keep your clothes on and demand that they respect you as they would any other man. Because of residual puritanical values mixed with a heady dose of woman-hating (in specific, the expression of self-actualized female sexuality as dirty) you have to become a sexual object instead of a sexual agent. Thus, it's okay in this culture to please the penis, it's okay to dance around half naked. But it's not okay to like your body just the way it is clothed or unclothed, fat or skinny, short or tall, pale or tan. It's not okay to expect men to cater to your sexual needs as much as you cater to theirs. It's not okay to demand respect with your clothes on. It's not okay to still expect to be treated like a human being with your clothes off. And it's definitely not okay to actually insist that you want to express your sexuality on your own terms, and not cater to the male gaze at all.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Because they're kinda dumb. They aren't empowered at all; they are objects. They are servants. They serve men by becoming their fantasies and playing to their lusts.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Don't worry. Feminists don't believe it, either. Sex positivity is one thing, but it seems like sex is all these "dolls" care about.|`|u0j1KywNaa	i dont think their sluts. they flaunt what they have and they have fun dancing how they want, but it doesnt mean they sleep with a bunch of people. They may feel theyre empowering women because they do what they want and dont care about what other people think of them.|`|62ZBofvPaa	Because they do what they want, not harming anyone, not worrying about being judged...pretty basic really.  You don't have to like it but it is their right.|`|BHb5LPb1aa	Cos as soon as they say they are "empowering women" they sell more cds as young girls think thats what being a women is all about    How they are "empowering women" with lyics like "i want you to loosen up my button babe ah hay"|`|AA10829482	They are just out to make a buck. . . .if they got paid to wear burkas, that's what they would wear.
FL67UPPHaa	Sandstorm!!! Is that you? Nice to see you back! :D    The early forms were brilliant. Women could have an education, vote and make choices about their lives. Modern "liberation" seems to be more about casual sex than anything else, and society would be much better off without it.|`|vEj7xoBraa	bad thing.They gave women the freedom to do everything including hit men.|`|1d3NreHbaa	Good thing for women that want it, and bad for chauvinistic men, and traditional women, some anyway, but over all its a good thing.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	What do you think? Here; I'll tell you what I have discovered, but you have to make up your own mind as to whether it's a good thing or a bad thing.  1. "Married women had no control of their earnings, inheritance, property..." http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...  However, "Colonial wives also benefited from ante nuptial and post nuptial contracts. Ante nuptial contracts  many of these appear in old court records  let a woman retain control over her own property." http://www.genealogymagazine.com/coloand...  2. "Husbands could legally beat their wives." http://www.angelfire.com/ca/HistoryGals/...   However, "The colonies limited or outlawed physical abuse of wives. In 1641, for instance, Massachusetts prohibited wife beating unless it be in his own defense upon her assault. In the Southern colonies, laws prevented husband from inflicting death or permanent injury on their partners." http://www.genealogymagazine.com/coloand...  To go along with what I just said "wife-beaters could be punished with fines or whipping, and could also be subjected to public "shaming" in church or expelled from the congregation."  http://www.iwf.org/news/show/19011.html   About the only right thing the libbers did is get the vote, which counts for those who are politically gifted.  And before the Women's property act was made legal http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awla...  women were already making sure they had those rights.  Now, law in those days was hard on everyone; not just the women.  "As a matter of fact, not very many punishments were carried out because of the lack of power by the court system." http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/all...
A2XYCdOYaa	When I was at school I was never known as one of the popular pretty girls.  I used to hate the fact that all the really nasty girls, that were bully's towards me as well, were always so loved by the boys.    Its all one big popularity contest...the boys are trying to impress her to compete against each other I expect.    But what goes around comes around, alot of the girls from my class have lost their infamous looks and are not even a quartre as popular as they once were.|`|e2DEQ6Euaa	The boys in your class are simply immature. Their just going along with what they think their peers want. She is simply the latest craze to them. When they grow up, stop being influenced by peer pressure and realize that looks are not everything, they'll ditch her.
51aab76992abf2cf64e2ea6cbb7543b3aa	I know this isn't exactly what you asked, but I know a great deal about Mercyhurt's forensic program so I figured I would address that for you.    Let me start off by saying that Mercyhurst has an EXCELLENT MS in forensic anthropology, however, it is very different from most Masters in forensic anthropology.  Most schools take a "four field" approach to any graduate degree.  Which basically means that although you may have a focus (mine was forensic anthropology), you are still required to take classes in all four fields of Anthropology.  There is a great debate about whether the four field approach is better than say a more applied approach (like at Mercyhurst, where you get drilled intensely in forensic anthropology but not really in cultural anthro or linguistics).  That being said, if you are seriously interested in forensic anthropology Mercyhurst is a GREAT stepping stone to get to a top PhD program (Marcyhurst is becoming a pipeline to U of Tennessee, which is probably the first or second best school in the country for forensic anthropology...I think U of FL is right up there with Tennessee).  The forensic anthropology field in the US is dominated by graduates from U of Tennessee, not to mention the FBI recruits agents and scientists from there as well.  Further, the Smithsonian in Washington also has U of Tennessee grads.    I guess what I'm basically trying to say is that if you get a MS from Mercyhurst and go on to get a PhD, you will probably not have a problem getting a job in forensic anthropology.  Either as a professor, at a coroner's office, museum, etc.  U of Tennessee has great networking and by association Mercyhurst does as well.    I'm sorry I couldn't give you more information about the archaeology side of things but I did take a course there called "Death Scene Archaeology" so I know they do an excellent job of combining archaeological techniques with forensics.    If you have any more questions about this, feel free to contact me.
SK6MZ66Maa	Some guys can get attached to "casual relationships," believe it or not ( I was there, and it took a lot on my part to break the guy off. He was too attached to me).    It really depends on the guy. Some guys want something serious, whereas others don't.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	Men are hard wired to react with their nether regions when faced with any woman they find attractive, just the nature of the beast.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	Sounds to me that you are taking a personal experience and projecting it on " men ".    Additionally, it's a bit confusing how you weave from casual ,to commitment and back ?    To try to answer your question, most guys I know would prefer to have casual relationships with a few women , rather than a committed relationship with one..  Friends with benefits  A bull pen  A stable|`|35b5cce42b18603478e2fb3370a123d2aa	Perhaps you are dating the wrong men and to avoid getting angry about it (understandable but why waste your time on it) maybe you should date someone else.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	I'm getting so sick of these 'men can't commit' or 'men are so insecure' accusations (and implications) against men. The answer to your question is no.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	"...and even older supposedly more emotionally mature men..."    'nuff said. you clearly have a very low, feminist opinion of men.|`|PNwr3JgBaa	They are not afraid of commitment, they just want to have sex with you and then never see you again hopefully.|`|HimBbU6caa	I've always been very good with having casual relationships with women.|`|25I5WN52aa	Wow, you think all men are like that? Awesome, just tell them to turn gay then there won't be any problem.|`|cDmWXce3aa	First answer: yes. Second (more detailed) answer: the only thing i can tell you is that I as a man am sometimes... well, afraid of relationships. As a man I (generally speaking i mean no offense to anyone) am usually burdened with making the first move. This puts stress on me and as a result makes me think unclearly. I sometimes even respond differently than I did the first time to a possible other. Besides that if I starting flirting with someone I've known for a while I could have confliting issues in my head about whether or not I want to risk a friendship by flirting with her. This is my best answer. I hope it gave you some insight.
AA11530601	hey I had thoughts very similar to you and i ended up developing avoidant personality disorder (where you avoid all social contact of every sort because the reason is you hate yourself so much) - it all starts with you wanting to turn the tables on ppl and reject them 1st. I really feel for you. I am now a lot over my disorder but I still find it hard to initiate friendships or even desire them unless I am forced. Its like im used to my own company now. But you need to make peace with urself. There is nothing wrong with not having ur social life as the be all and end all. Friends are often transitory, just ppl we go to the pub with - it really depends what u want from ur social life. As long as I can have someone to go out with, I dont need to share my personal problems. But the best kind of friend is where u dont have to pretend to be anyone else when ur with them. It can cause all kinds of problems if you take what ur saying so seriously - u become aloof (like I did) and ppl assume that you are weak, and even in the adult world this can mean some ppl pick on you. If you are a bit louder to begin with, then they will never see you as a possible target. I dont mean crazy loud, just not totally aloof cause to some ppl they mistake that as weakness cause they dont understand ur unique view on the world and how u want to be alone. It can also cause problems when u see others going out and having fun  - the answer is to have one person who you do something with once a week. Dont be so hard on yourself - and dont give up on yourself - there isnt nything wrong with you and when someone talks to you, just make sure your approval is coming from you and not from them and you will come accross as strong and independant.|`|MWe4hMm1aa	i think most people think deeply from time to time. it's just when the're with friends they want to forget their toubles and have fun. you should try and do that too. you have to get loose once in a while. try taking life less seriously.|`|YYvO39vLaa	Hmm i feel the same way seriously. im definitly not an A student tho lol. but i guess your growing up and theres nothing wrong with that. =]|`|LQUHzXTcaa	It means you are growing up. It's a good thing. A good change. Reading is a very VERYgood thing, because you are broadening your views and educating yourself. Just don't conform to the mass. Be yourself and think for yourself! =]|`|E70A7aqcaa	Your change may have some good points, but, as a mental health professional with 20+ years experience, now retired, I'd have to have a more thorough interview with you to say more definitively just how good it may be. I will advise this.  Don't get too impressed with yourself.  That is  definitely the precursor to a downfall.  It's clinically proven.  God Bless you.|`|hOSDysG3aa	It is certainly that you are growing up, whilst this may sound condescending (it did to me when I was sixteen), I don't mean to be. I just know that when I look back at the sixteen year old I was, I do not recognise myself. I would say that from sixteen into my early twenties, I changed completely (I am now 36). I also felt just like you, and still do.   Whilst you may have grown apart from your old friends, you will make new friends, as long as you get out there and find them! Another positive is that you are young enough to use that education to get into a career that will enable you to, at least, choose a career that enables you to help effect change in some way.|`|ocwetmQuaa	It's called growing up.  Welcome to the real world.|`|lP9kQmRraa	The change you are experiencing could be both classified as good and bad.  The good is that you are putting more emphasis on your school work BUT you do not want to lose your relationships.  Friends are very important in life.      These are some of the better years of your life and its important to gain and maintain the social skills you have learned.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	its good that you work hard now, its very good it shows you have much needed self discipline. these are hard times globally and its important that people be more conscious of their actions and consequences.  however in all this dont slip into the thought that work and study is evrything, adults have this very negative influence on young people..sort of make them think its not okay to enjoy life, that its immature and not responsible.  Remember to live for yourself and thats all that matters, whether its getting the education that you want and just simply enjoying yourself. if this is a 'change' that has neturally arrived then all is good, however if you find that this a result of some sort of external influence then just be careful in discriminating clearly between YOUR desires and feelings. xx|`|ZH9T8Liiaa	I guess your just growing up and becoming more mature.

OUbNSXjJaa	When on LSD, we lend our brain to some sort of ghost like thing. Your real identity is lost when you are on LSD. Somebody else works in your place.|`|KkZE2NDYaa	I don't condone experimenting with drugs, but I would say your ability to distinguish between what is "rational" and what is not depends on the dosage and your state of mind beforehand. Do research on medical studies they did with LSD before it was illegal. Drugs affect different people in different ways. That is one of the reasons some are considered dangerous. Happy trails to you.|`|oIdwxlutaa	It is possible that you could have a "bad trip" and somehow rationalize that it is a good idea to kill yourself.  I almost jumped into a campfire once, because I thought it need fuel.  Fortunately a tiny bit of common sense remained in my brain that stopped me.  I'm a very positive person, never been suicidal or chronically depressed, so this tells me that you can get pretty far from the initial state of mind.  I think the incidence of suicide is pretty low, but it is a good idea to be with people who care about you and will try to prevent you from hurting yourself if get to that point, especially if you are a first-time or inexperienced user.  That said, LSD can be a wonderful drug that leads to lots of insights and an enriched experience of life, long after the drug has worn off.    I'd encourage you to do more research.  Check out some of the trip reports on erowid.org if you want to learn more.
uakYPM1faa	I am getting a PhD in neuroscience at a medical university and received my BA in psychology.    You can go into neuro from either undergrad background. Psych is the more fun route, but basically no matter what you're going to get out what you put in.   I'm an extremely studious person and would say that coming from psych hasn't hurt me at all. But I worked my -ss off in my free time. And when I came to grad school I certainly had a whole lot more work to do in molecular biology and biochem.     People from neuroscience backgrounds tend to look down on people from psych backgrounds. But I've yet to meet the student yet who would challenge my knowledge in the field, so you shouldn't let this bother you if you do pursue psych.    If you work hard it's not going to matter what you enter into. Do what you like best.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	im doing neuroscince in autumn cant wait!!|`|AJeaWX8Paa	Neuroscience is the study of the brain using imaging technology: fMRI, MRI, EEG, ERP, etc.  Neuroscience uses these tools to map the brain and study levels of activation in different regions.     Psychology is extremely broad.  It is the study of how the mind influences our daily lives (in the most broad sense).  I would look into more detail about the different branches of psychology for more information.    There is a branch of psychology called cognitive neuroscience that is the intersection between the two.  Cog neuro is looking at different areas of activation within the brain in response to different psychological stimuli.  An example would be measuring levels of activation while having someone remember a list of objects.  This looks into the neuroscience (brain activation) as well as psychology (memory span) at the same time.

XzrTB9fSaa	You are feeling a loss of the social norm. You have something on your mind that no one seems to be helping you with. You feel distant from your environment and are having a problem dealing with an issue. Also, you might have too many things going on that you can't accomplish everything so the lack of that accomplishment causes you to compensate by an elimination process.    Stop thinking about your problem and the answer will come to you.|`|uXQcDsiAaa	It means that ur ruining somebody's life.

R6IYY4miaa	It's totally normal to have sexual dreams about someone you're not interested in sexually. All people have sex dreams about other people, and most people have sex dreams about people they're not particularly interested in. There's a million reasons why you could be dreaming about this specific girl- subconscious attraction, feeling like your girlfriend's spending too much time with her, focusing on your dislike of her more than normal because she's around more now. It doesn't really matter why as long as you're not bothered with them. They will pass in time, don't worry about it.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	First you need to analyze everything about Michelle and exactly what she means to you.  She might just be symbolic for what you perceive about her and her relationship with your girlfriend.  You might just be wanting to make that part of her your own.  Sex makes a person whole in a way so the sex might just be symbolic of making whatever aspect you see in Michelle part of you.  It might be the close friendship she has with your girlfriend or something like that.  Good luck and God bless.|`|Kfckzk48aa	becuase you truly. like HER.|`|LdoCKo4Qaa	Well... would your girlfriend be willing to invite Michelle over for a three-way?  Maybe that would get it out of your system.|`|qBG8pp7laa	This might mean that you're a pervert deep inside.
svOneExjaa	First off, we are not talking about sexual / offensive touching here. What we are discussing is casual as a tool to engage and keep someones attention on you type of touching. It is our body language, which means not deliberate in any way and natural self expression of interest. BTW, most of the time we don't even know we are doing that, so it is the most honest response you will ever get.     Now, guys are mostly controlled by completely different area of their brain. Which means their body language will be different; direct eye contact, smile, undivided attention, 'accidental' hug, casual touch etc.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	Because most men don't want to deal with a sexual harassment suit.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	Interesting question, but not always true.  Ever seen that show The Pickup Artist?  They talk about ways of flirting with women and "escalating kino" (increasing physical contact, subtly and appropriately) in order to increase sexual attraction.    Maybe women are more likely, but in all honesty, I don't know for sure.|`|AA11530601	its cause women feel at liberty to do it without being accused of sexual harrassment or being a pervert. The idea is that since guys want sex, they should like it. But I think its a double standard. I am a woman by the way.|`|XHweMNNkaa	Tommy, you probably get that answer by picking up women in brothels. Otherwise, I don't really know how you could have gotten it. I think maybe you assume women can only use sex, because you only want sex, and therefore you only get women that use it.|`|Unz3W0EEaa	Is that right? I did not notice.|`|sosisPXbaa	Because men who touch too early may scare a girl off.  Might give her creepy vibes if she's not comfortable yet.  And men that know what they're doing will know that if a girl is really into you, she'll flirt and be touchy.  Besides it's more of a challenge when a guy demonstrates self control, it makes him more mysterious and desirable most of the time.|`|zIpbIWb3aa	Women are less likely to be called a pervert when touching someone of the opposite sex that they don't know. Or the put it another way, men are more predictable in their response.|`|8j00htVVaa	most men dont want offend the lady. the ladies are not worried about offending men because men are not as easy as women to be offended.|`|qBG8pp7laa	All of the above. :{D|`|OTT79NAtaa	Because women aren't generally good at flirting outside of touching or hinting towards sex. Women generally have no game.

ANY Feminist??????    ALL of the Feminists have done that!     SHEESH!!!     From what I can tell, and the Feminists keep their earnings a closely guarded secret, due to the horrified surprise their followers would express if they ever found out how much they've been bilked for. It looks like Germaine Greer and Andrea Gherkin, erm, Dworkin are pretty close to the top earners, but Betty Fraud-an, erm, Freidan might just pip them at the post in terms of numbers of lies, erm, Feminists Books, sold.     It's certainly difficult to decide who is the more ugly.|`|OTT79NAtaa	I think we'd simply have to look at the bottom line and do a search of the highest paid person who identifies themselves as feminist- as it's obvious they've all achieved their notoriety through their exploitation of their 'victimhood'.|`|7J6m0L3Haa	Feminists are neither wrongful victims, nor are they rich, making your argument null and void on both ends.    That wasn't a very good attempt, if I say so myself.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	I don't agree with playing the victim card, obviously, but do you really think that many people are in it for the money? Please.
Ia4jEzQ4aa	Well not everyones dreams are the same, so a dream dictionary isn't always correct!     Since our brain connects places, animals, and people with feelings, the crow is probably a common animal to connect with death and fear and stuff. However, that might not be how YOUR brain sees it, so it all depends :)
S4QBvAaGaa	If you can't fix things with your boyfriend for the better, you have to deal with your emotions.   Keep a dream diary(or just a diary) and begin fixing the issues your dreams concerns. What was the most prevalent feeling? When did it occur in the dream? WHat was the subject matter? Only you know what's really bothering you so deal with it. Even if you can't figure out what your dreams are telling you, you can still get rid of the emotional energy from dreaming. Just write (or type)out your dreams in detail and say exactly what you want to say about the dream. If you're comfortable with it, pretend you're writing to someone else and try and explain in as much details possible what your dream was.   I can't promise it'll help but it has definitely worked for me(Oh my, I sound like an infomercial). It doesn't have to be done regularly or anything, just when you feel like getting something out.  Good Luck! :)|`|6vlNSK3uaa	If you don't sleep, you won't dream. That's the only way.

oZPLI8Y5aa	Starting is the hard part. Make yourself begin with a time limit - but in that 15 minutes or whatever make yourself actually work. You may find once you get going it is not so bad. i.e. the only thing you have to fear is the fear itself.|`|3YK2dJxLaa	i used to procrastinate all the time, but after i joined a sport i had less time to just sit around on the computer and do nothing. so i was forced not to do homework at the last minute.    do a sport thru school...it's really fun, get's you active, and prevents procrastination|`|tqfkHiEQaa	I'll tell you tomorrow|`|eFxjH7W7aa	Set a timer for 15 minutes and do not move away from the project
81c1606e8b69fbf385e8ccb9d683032eaa	that would be the behavioral perspective because it focuses on stimulus - response relationships.  so an example would be if a child acts out in a classroom, but is a perfect angel at home, this can be explained due to a learned response to the classroom environment (i,e. the teacher is mean, or he/she gets more attention when he/she is acting out).    another example would be if a person is very sociable when out with their friends, but becomes introverted when hanging out with stranger.  a behaviorst would say that the individual leanred to be sociable with friends because they provided reinforcement for his/her talking behavior.    so essentially in behaviorsm, all behaviors are learned and must be reinforced by the particular environment, which explains why different environments can elicit different responses.
f0e6bb08f78bda5965b94f88de6064f6aa	I don't see how you were wrong.  If you were truly  her friend she would have confided in you some of those personal issues.  She simply started giving you the brush off and then acted offended when you said something about her behavior.    If anyone should be giving an apology it should be you getting one from her.  Until that time I wouldn't bother with her and she certainly wouldn't be considered a friend of mine.  Friends don't treat each other so boorishly.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	IDK, it seems odd to me. Obviously if they are having some personal issues the only thing you can do is be there for them. Try to find out what's going on? It's not cool that they keep making and breaking plans (I would be upset as well).    I don't see how you did anything wrong. No explanation leads to no understanding...|`|7k8QirQzaa	it wasn't wrong for you to explode in your friend's face when she didn't give you a straight answer as to why she had other plans.    but it was wrong for you to not give her space and let her tell you eventually.
EOZsYlZkaa	Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid tryptophan. It is not obtained from the sunlight. Furthermore, neurons maintain a very tight control on the amount of neurotransmitter synthesized. If the brain's homeostatic mechanisms detect that there is sufficient neurotransmitter (in this case, serotonin) then synthesis will shut down. In other words, unless you lack a neurotransmitter, there is no way to increase its concentration (unless of course you play around with recreational drugs). You might be talking about melatonin. Melatonin has been shown to decrease the effects of jet lag by altering your internal circadian rhythm.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Serotonin is produced in your pineal gland. When serotonin becomes inactive DimethylTryptamine (DMT) floods your system causing powerful hallucinations. DMT levels are high when you dream and in near death experiences. DMT taken recreationally is the most intense psychedelic known to man. I don't know if anyone has yet proved that serotonin levels CAUSE happiness rather than happiness causing serotonin levels to rise. I think that the debate is still out there.     The sun is a source of vitamin D and a lot more for all I know. The sun is great and I'm not entirely sure why.    Am I talking about Melatonin rather than serotonin?|`|uNRMU9fyaa	No, you wouldn't be happier if you lived closer to the equator. Even though sunlight HELPS trigger the release of serotonin, the circulation of serotonin in the brain is closely regulated. Maybe the production of serotonin would be quicker, but I doubt people near the equator would be happier.
epkNwQEqaa	Try listening to different music. You have to move on.|`|GWRP3vLQaa	If you had a big emotional investment in this relationship, you are understandably still feeling your loss. Crying helps let go of those feelings. If you think you are too emotional and crying all the time, you might want to cut back on those songs that feed those feelings, and take a few baby steps toward moving on.     Eventually, you will feel better and be happy again. Good luck.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Letting your emotions out is good. Forcing your emotions out is bad. Any active role you play in that emotion only fuels it. Doing nothing ABOUT it is the key. Life's energy will change you without you having to do anything. You must change to survive, and active change is not real change. Effort taken when dealing with emotion is counter productive. Doing nothing at all about anything is impossible, but doing nothing about something specific is entirely possible. Doing nothing and not doing anything.|`|UEQAd6A0aa	awww im sorry sweetie. and yes it is normal, its good to let your emotions out sometimes|`|scuqlD8Qaa	perfectly normal...|`|ToILKl6waa	It's certainly normal and there's nothing to fret about. You simply went through a rough patch in your life. In doing so, you've become a highly sensitive person and get emotional in a lot of areas within your life.    Try getting your emotions out in a healthy way. Do you have a journal where you can write down all your grief? Make it a part of your life, and you will be surprised by the positive results.|`|WgIZUcYfaa	You're normal. Don't worry. It took me a year to get over a guy I dated for only six months.

Yes, if gov't supports daycare there will be more money for families to spend on clothing.    3. No, if it costs you more money to make your product, then you will have to raise your prices.    4. Yes, getting your clothing to market at the best possible price is conducive to lower prices.    5. No, any taxes that you have to pay will increase the cost of doing your business, taking away from profits.|`|edycn5ggaa	1) Support, it will provide incentive for people within the US market to buy from domestic factories (the one that is being represented), and it encourages foreign countries to import your clothing.  2) Public good allows for more consumer expenditure so yes.  3) No, this will diminish supply of clothing produced because the price of the raw materials going into the final product has gone up.  4) Support, the less competition the better.  5) No, again, it will lower the quantity at which the manufacturer can produce and may hinder them from hitting economies of scale.
9fnbMzXnaa	I know it sounds weird....but make a list.  Well, really make two. A short term goals (6 wks or so) and long term goals (1 to 5 yrs).    Sometimes the sorting of your thoughts and the crossing off of the list eases the mind and makes accomplishments seem more concrete.|`|AA11530601	Eh....im 23 (24 this year) and I feel like that....its just a feeling though, what counts is action. I have no job, but once I get one I know I'll feel a lot better, even though im crapping myself about it and not looking forward to it. It sounds like you are over analysing and thinking too much. I would advise being a bit less introspective. I am naturally pretty introspective but its a habit that can actually bring you down if you do it too much. Turning your life round from every angle in your mind wont really help much. Its not wrong to feel like sh*t. But you have to sometimes do things despite feeling like sh*t and just go through the motions, apply for jobs, do what you can and what you need to, and then relax. And dont think too much!|`|BNAzjSO1aa	I think most people feel like that at some time in their life's. Try to exercise more eat a healthy diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables, try to avoid food loaded with additives and chemicals. If you are looking for work why don;t you try volunteering until you can get a paid job, not only will it give you less time to dwell on the negative points of your life it will give you another weapon in your search for work, by showing that you are willing to work given the chance and most importantly of all is to stop being to hard on yourself everyone needs some r &r sometimes hope this helps|`|tNfjre0Laa	No decent person life is wrong its the way you think thats wrong
pzLDXL6gaa	OK well that's a little creepy. I guess I can understand wanting another virgin if you're one too, but that shouldn't be one of the major traits you look for in a potential partner, because then if you get too obsessed you might find out you're with a virgin who you have nothing in common with. And if this desire continues after you've had lots of sexual partners, that is a bit weird and hypocritical.    Even if she's a virgin, she might not have an intact hymen. For lots of girls they break before sex (and some girls don't even notice) and only about half of all girls bleed.    Harriet|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	I don't consider what you are going through a problem just don't be obsessive about. And don't mind those who call you lame, a freak or shallow. I am in the same position as you and i too want to be with someone who saved their virginity for marriage.|`|IwUpusQiaa	this doesn't mean you're a jerk!  it's not like you think less of women who aren't virgins, you are just  more comfortable with someone who has the same level of experience as you, and that makes sense.  i hope you reconsider and try to keep an open-mind, but if not, don't feel terrible about your decision and preferences.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	It's not abnormal, it's just incredibly lame.  You're trying to feel special by being a girl's 'first'.   Bear in mind that you could break her hymen, but it doesn't mean that she wasn't doing anything else.  She could've been blowing every guy in the back of the school bus, that's hardly 'virginal'.    Besides, how fulfilling is it to have some chick bleeding all over your sheets?  Get someone who will enjoy it.    Also, remember that a broken hymen doesn't necessarily mean that she's had sex.  It can break for several different reasons.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	It's normal.    It's also normal for a virgin guy to not want to sleep with an experienced woman because he might not feel like he'll "live up to her standards."    Also, virginity is a special thing, and it can be understandable that you want to share it with someone who is also a virgin.    However, it's not like you can just ask a girl on a date: "By the way, are you a virgin and do you still have an intact hymen?"    As a side note: some of my best lovers were virgins. :)|`|H55nCLqPaa	Rest assured that all men think as you do. Some don't admit it of course, even to themselves.    There is nothing wrong with wanting your future wife to be a virgin, everything is purer and more special the first time you do it. Of course you want to be the only man she's ever had a sexual/romantic connection with, that's like wanting a new car rather than a second hand one, it's a no-brainer and requires no explanation or justification.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	no need to be ashamed. you feel how you feel and that's that.    you can and probably will change your mind someday. but if you dont.....you dont. its not a big deal.|`|BPZPxzBnaa	Relax.|`|NV3eIjLcaa	Don't ever feel ashamed about your preferences is women. Don't let these fools convince you that you are a 'jerk' or that you are defective, or shallow.|`|zcPKjOnUaa	its normal and I'm pretty sure a man would prefer a virgin girl than non-virgin if he has a choice. We want a virgin girl to have sex with because we can make sure that her children will have our genes in it(no cheating), according to revolutionary psychology.   Of course, this mindset can be changed over time, probably have a correlation with the experiences you have with girls|`|S88wOtSkaa	no thats totally normal! its kind of disturbing to think that someone you care about has been with other guys. but you should try to be open minded and not judge people from their past. you might miss out on some really great girls.|`|99f3375ecb12e908f1956b8e03fc4f44aa	fyi, many virgin girls nowadays have already broken their hymen because of sports or tampons before even having sex.  and wanting a virgin is not a bad thing as long as you are not a hypocrite and decide to have all the sex you want, but expect your girl to be "pure".|`|35b5cce42b18603478e2fb3370a123d2aa	Does it really matter?  There are more important concerns that a woman's virginity.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	I'm guessing you're pretty young, and oddly enough, I don't think you're being shallow.  You're simply trying to work out your feelings.  It seems as though you feel that when you fall in love with a girl, you want to be the only guy she's been with, just as she would be the only girl you've been with.  Surprisingly enough, there are couples like that out there, where they lost their virginity to each other and have stayed together for quite some time.    But the thing to keep in mind is that in today's world, it's very hard to find a virgin over the age of 16.  It's simply not realistic that you will marry a woman who has never had sex before.  What's more important in a relationship is that you remain loyal to each other, because in the end, when a woman falls in love, it doesn't matter who she's had sex with in the past... all that matters it the man she wants to spend her life with.    So... be realistic, and more importantly, be safe.|`|im9HVuWfaa	There's nothing wrong with being a virgin and wanting the same out of the person you first have sex with.    However, you stated that you are "after the hymen of a girl" .  That sounds like to you, it is just a conquest to be the first, and if this is your goal, you sound quite immature and perhaps not ready for a real, adult relationship.  It doesn't make you a jerk, just kind of sad.|`|zIpbIWb3aa	Don't feel bad because there's nothing wrong with you. Feeling like this is completely normal. When I was a virgin I felt the same way. A friend of mine told me that unless I was a virgin I shouldn't judge women like that. I told him that I was a virgin because because I felt that it was wrong to hold a woman to a higher standard than I hold myself. He looked me in the eye and told me that the world doesn't work that way. After learning the hard way that he was right by suffering heartbreak after heartbreak, I decided to stop waiting and live a life of extreme promiscuity.
OUbNSXjJaa	Much headway has not been made in sensory perception study. Human nerves are super sensitive. It does wonderful functions in our body. It is like highly advanced tele-communication system. It is a difficult study. It is not easy to know its scientific meaning. But it is a highly philosophical subject. Intricate. A deep devotional study is required. Only adept can grasp the meaning. Ordinary folks cannot attempt. Only gifted people, who have discipline and mind control can venture.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	I couldn't find anything on google about NSP, but I can ask you what can be perceived but not sensed? Perception is your sense of location in the world around you. It's a sense as far as I can understand it.
AA11530601	Yes I had OCD and I have read SO much on the topic. What you are showing is definitely symtoms.Its different for everyone but common "obsessions" include numbers and hygeine and tidiness. I was a hygeine freak, but it sounds like your thing is numbers. To stop it, you can either go to your docs or try and beat it yourself. I went to my docs and he gave me some medication but i didnt really want to take them, so I battled it myself and slowly overcame it. I would say the number one thing you have to do is remind yourself that these thoughts you have are NOT REAL they are just symptoms if a disease, OCD. Studies show that giving in to them and "believing them" always fuels more of them, because they neural pathways in your brain become supporting these OCD thoughts become stronger with use, meaning the compulsion gets stronger. The most effective (and hardest at 1st) thing to do is to ignore them but you MUST if you are going to get better. It really is the only way. If you ignore them just twice a day then you are on your way to recovery. Its always a slow process but you just have to make yourself ignore them as often as possible. I have had OCD since 2003 now and I have finally beaten it but only since last year. Dont give up, if you fail, just try again and again and again, it is the only way. Also, the more you ignore them, the less the thoughts will bother you. So it does get easier. I promise. Good luck   x|`|MojYmo5Jaa	Nothing bad will happen to you if you stop this, just condition your mind, it is just a thought and you have to remember that. Try doing it slightly different each day until you condition your mind.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	yes that sounds like it. What worked for me was to get laid. Eventually I didn't care if the number of strokes were odd, even or multiples of 5.|`|vMY3EF8baa	yeah sounds like it.  you should just push urself outside ur comforts until you learnt to deal with it!|`|ad4daf6f7da719b58951682b49e79c01aa	Definitely OCD. OCD is an anxiety disorder try relaxation techniques when you feel this way.
4Vchxp32aa	Correlation means nothing-->it never really does.  They may very well be correlated, but being dumb doesn't make you spell better and being smart doesn't make you spell worse.  Remember correlation does not imply causation.      That being said, it is certainly an interesting topic of which to learn more.  Maybe we can understand, if this is true for the entire population, why it is so?  Maybe it deals with memory in some sense.  Smarter people need less memories (or examples) to understand a topic.  Maybe that is part of it.  I have no idea.  It's interesting to at the very least if it is true.    Yeah, people who spell really well are really dumb.  Isn't that logical?      P.S.  Don't fall for everything you hear.  This is nonsense.  If you graphed IQ and spelling ability, you'd get a damn scatter plot.  If you find something that contradicts this, post a link.|`|iE2sDxDAaa	I would not be surprised if that was true.    Of course, when you think of intelligent individuals, you tend to think of individuals involved in science, math, and technology fields (all known for their bad spelling)...not art, music, and writing.     As far as I know,  IQ tests have been proven to be rather unreliable so I'm not sure how you would determine one's intelligence. I would like to see someone actually study this though.    BTW, anyone can get into college. I have met some of the dumbest people while in college. I cannot understand how they made it through the 6th grade.|`|s7BECvzAaa	I disagree with your professor.  His statement implies that persons with good spelling abilities are not intelligent.  Your spelling appears to be impeccable, and you are in college.  Not everyone can get into college, therefore it takes a certain amount of intelligence.  You are intelligent and you spell well that case disproves your professor's claim.    Also it is important to remember that correlation doesn't mean causation.  There's a correlation between the amount of beer i drink and how much wool is produced on a sheep farm in Colorado.    Well it warms up in summer so i tend to drink more cold beer...it just happens to be the best time to shave the wool off sheep|`|YIlP4yNaaa	Yes. Correlated intelligence is good negatively.|`|0EoDkkA1aa	Knowing how to spell and avoiding slang terms makes one look professional at all times. I'm not too sure about intelligence but as for me, I had poor grammar and didn't spell properly on purpose during high school. I guess it was a 'cool' thing to do but now in the real world, things have changed. I feel someones grammar and structure on how they write/type gives an overall presentation of their maturity and intelligence.|`|76fYDbsCaa	I think that people who can't spell aren't usually very bright. I mean I knew a guy that couldn't spell "determine" and he was a complete idiot. It only takes memory to learn how to spell, but I can decipher Latin because I know Spanish and I can actually spell the specific word out, so i think that takes some sort of intelligence. Being a good speller means your likely to be good at English. I mean you can see patterns that others can't and your good linguistically. You just dominate the language and in a way that is intelligence, because it makes you quick learner in any reading class or writing class.|`|1b7Bcvobaa	Yer profeser sownds dumb.|`|5WndiEKVaa	I don't think being a good speller has to do with your intelligence.|`|PtoieF7Caa	There are many kinds of intelligence, it depends on what you as an individual considered to be intelligent.  I think spelling requires a specialist kind of intelligence. To have good spelling you require two things, one is a good memory capacity, the other is perception.  Generally people who are considered "intelligent" have very good perception, reasoning and analytical skills but it's very often the case that they have a poor or "scatter-brained" memory. They forget details and just memorize a general idea.  My spelling is terrible, i'm actually dyslexic. I can remember a word pattern but letter ordering I find very difficult. I was always described as having "creative spelling" I would get the letters right but not always the order in which they occur, my spelling was considered poor. I have improved but I still struggle. I have a grammar school friend who had the same sort of problem and a cousin who also struggled. I would consider both to be intelligent people. So it's entirely possible that your Professor has some grounds for his theory but I feel you can't generalize a group. It's very likely that you will find excellent spellers who are very intelligent as well as poor spellers who are less than intelligent.

I'm a women's rights activist, but I'm not a fanatic about it. And, keeping that in mind, let me tell you what I think.  Feminists usually want to prove that women are people, too. And, with that belief, they want to perpetuate the individuality in everyone. Most of them believe that everyone is unique, and most of them are very accepting and tolerant.   So, I believe that there are probably some feminists who read romance novels, and I believe that most feminists don't oppose romance literature.|`|IwUpusQiaa	while i find many of them truly annoying... every once in a while, i find one i can indulge in.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Why are you asking guys??

And buying your way into happiness will never work, ever. Happiness leads to success. SO be friendly and "be yourself" then people will want to be around you more. There is a problem when it comes to trying too hard and wanting to fit in becasue it backfires, so just do the opposite and relax and have fun.

SjDVMh3Uaa	I think it means that when you did smoke you found it to be enjoyable most of the time. It could mean that you fear you may start again at some time. My guess is you had to hide smoking in your younger days and this has seeped into your adulthood thinking. I am guessing these things because I am an ex smoker myself I started smoking when I was 14 and had to hide it from my parents or face a beating. I quit after 7 years and stayed quit for 15 years and during that time I had the same dreams. I missed smoking because I actually liked it. I would wish I could smoke without being addicted. I started smoking again and did so for 2 years, but this time when I quit I was really sick and tired of it and I almost did not make it, it has now been 19 years since the second time quitting and I no longer desire to smoke because it was not as enjoyable the second time and even though I do have these kinds of dreams every once in a while it is not as often or as disturbing.    I am not sre if your situation is the same as mine but that is my guess and why I guessed it this way.|`|4f8fdRbpaa	go and look it up in the dream books thats where you will get the right answer for this. Ps I wished I had one myself|`|8SEVTKz5aa	thats y its bad to smoke  even when u quit, u have lifelong cravings  so i think the dream is just one of the craving moments|`|7fd360fcb6c75172b930140c20159104aa	check out dreammoods.com and it translate the meaning of your dreams|`|1qU2YMUpaa	It sounds like your hiding something.  Or you've changed in some way, either too fast, or something about you has changed for the benefit of other people and you didn't want it to.  So in your dream you've reverted back to someone you used to be (a smoker) and you are expecting to be chastised for it, so you have to hide it.  The smoking in your dream could represent an idea a habit, job, haircut, anything you can stop or change.  But I'm no dream expert!  That's what it sounds like to me.

The opportunity cost is what needs to be given up in order to get something else. Person A can produce 1 good X in 5 hours, but only 1/2 good Y in that same amount of time. Person B is equally efficient producing both goods, so it can produce 1 X or 1 Y in 5 hours. Person A needs to give up 2 good X in order to produce 1 good Y.|`|poOjs31caa	fb

74f4187d34db51d014e0616fd9bb778caa	FYI, this probably isn't going to help... This is obviously the site of a longer term dwelling used by nomads before the great ice age. the mammoth tooth hinted towards the oncoming ice age (not to mention they werent with humans very long). The bison and deer bones, along with fish as well hints that they have a plethera of food stuffs, and there is water very close by. Most likely in the northern territories of Canada or Russia. The animal fat in the lantern is probably from the bison's fat. The nomads were extremely well versed in tool making, hunting, fishing, and documentation. Obviously after the basic "tool maker" homo class.|`|AA10505866	I'm not going to get too specific on this.    You're probably dealing with modern humans. Neanderthals apparently buried their dead, but they didn't tend to have such a complicated toolkit. Also, I think only modern humans ever encountered bison, or would bury a dog.    Dogs weren't domesticated until probably 14,000 years ago, or so. We have Bison, so we're probably in the Americas. I'm not sure exactly where one gets ivory in Americas, except maybe from Mastadon tusks.    The stone fragments out front could be ecofacts, or they could be debitage. Similarly, bones from animals out front that aren't in the hearth pit might be suspect.    A deep hearth probably means a long or serial occupation.    Lots of good avenues for dating here. That shouldn't be hard to figure out.

bOaqWNxRaa	Are you jealous?    No, I think that you have the right idea. I encourage you to think for yourself. Carve your own trails. Be a pioneer. Don't just do the traditional thing because everyone else does (not that there is really anything wrong with that, either). But the point of life is to be yourself, and embrace your own goals and convictions. Do whatever you want to with your life- it's yours!    Now, some young women are fit to start families at 18- but most aren't. Some women aren't fit at 28 or even 38. Some men aren't, either. Having kids isn't for everybody. Question things, and don't be afraid to think outside the box. You don't have to be just another clone.     I do think you could examine your own ideas from a different point of view, however- I am curious- why do you imply that having children and a family isn't productive? What on earth could possibly be MORE productive than that very thing?    I suppose it depends on your point of view. Doesn't it. You have to decide what you define as 'productive.' Perhaps for them it is a productive way to live- maybe for you, it isn't.     Good luck, and God speed!

Do not feel bad that you want to make something of your life and be successful and independant and not have to rely on other people for money and such.  I can't tell you how similar our situations are, I have many cousins in the same situation, they come from a small town that I was once from, I now live in the city and being 27 and one of the oldest cousins I am the odd one out at christmas dinners and such.  People think it's the greatest and they pay a lot of attention to them, I don't need that sort of attention but I feel EXACTLY the same as you.  I've been lucky to experience travel, owning my own home, different jobs and study and I think it's essential to bring children into the world being able to share this and know yourself, what have they to offer the child apart from love and support, that's not enough in this world.  There's nothing wrong with being judgemental, you stick to what you think is right for you and your future children and leave them be, some people say it's better to be naive, I assume this is the case, you are better than that!|`|AA11530601	haha i totally agree BUT you have to let people do what they want with their lives, some people really do just want to be mothers.

AleT38EYaa	Highlight that the global nature of this issue makes it one the government needs to address promptly.  Back after the Great Depression, many new jobs were created through FDR's "New Deal" which instituted numerous governmental departments and positions.  Things like the TVA (Tennessee Valley Authority) were created and still exist today.  I would not mention that one thing that helped was America's involvement in WWII.  That is a sticky topic; I did a mock trial in high school that argued if FDR knew about the attack on Pearl Harbor and allowed it to happen so we would want to enter the war and new jobs as soldiers would be created.      A temporary "stop order" on outsourcing jobs to other countries might also be necessary.  Any positions that go to China, India, etc. never return, which is "cutting off our nose to spite our face" economically over the long haul.      You might want to highlight personal responsibility we can take.  Many people are too stubborn to take a pay cut, even for a short time, because they are "holding out" for something better.  I would say to collect your unemployment, adjust your standards of living (do you really NEED Dish TV network, a brand-new car, expensive vacations, meals out 10x/week, etc?), and begin working again as quickly as possible.      It's going to be a long haul no matter what the government and individual americans do, but we can pull through.|`|edycn5ggaa	You can't set this up. There is no argument to it. It is obvious that this is a prevalent issue, not only in the US but on a global scale. If you re-read your question, it is hard to come up with a "persuasive" argument for your topic. I think you need to take on a different approach that you can argue.

Q9NHnC9Vaa	This is a really interesting and weird dream, but it has some meaning  Your dream is giving you an indication to look forward for new opportunities and work hard..     Psychological Meaning: Legs represent our ability to progress. If they are strong it shows your self-confidence but if they are weak/artificial you may feel emotionally unsteady at the moment.    To dream that you are qualified for handicapped parking and was really happy, , symbolizes your own weakness and neediness. You are confronted with many challenges and need to utilize your full potential.     To dream that you are running around with a prosthetic leg, signifies a lack of balance, autonomy, or independence in your life. You may be unable or unwilling to stand up for yourself. Perhaps you are lacking courage and refuse to make a stand.     Sometimes prosthetic leg, means you are representing yourself falsely to friends, family and others.    Good Luck!|`|TpJbtJCfaa	Has anyone close to you lost a body part?    If so that could be the answer, you may have been thinking of that person.

Not that this is a bad thing but that's just what I think.|`|RoOKte0Taa	well  it mostlikely means that, since your left leg is amputated, then either u are unstable( meaning as in unsure or worried) in something and you are covering it up with *a prosthetic leg* meaning something like a lie or  ur having some guilt.|`|iCXt7FfEaa	how you would react in your dream or feel is the same as when you are awake. you are willing to barter the more important things in life for the things that you just want. dreams come when you are tired, sick or want something so bad.  probably you always had a hard time looking for a parking space and wish you could park in a more accessible spot but never really thought the consequences of what you have to lose to be able to park there.

J3k9WgzKaa	Research    Recent linguistic research has suggested that non-pathological disfluencies may contain a variety of meaning; the frequency of "uh" and "um" in English is often reflective of a speaker's alertness or emotional state. Some have hypothesized that the time of an "uh" or "um" is used for the planning of future words; other researchers have suggested that they are actually to be understood as full-fledged function words rather than accidents, indicating a delay of variable time in which the speaker wishes to pause without voluntarily yielding control of the dialogue. There is some debate as to whether to consider them a form of white noise or as a meaning-filled part of language.    Speech disfluencies have also become important in recent years with the advent of speech-to-text programs and other attempts at enabling computers to make sense of human speech.    In America, since the 1980s, the word "like" has been used as a discourse marker similar to filled pauses like "um" or "uh" and is widespread among youth. For example, "I, like, don't know" instead of "I, uh, don't know".

My theory is simple, overspeculation on property, accompanied by subprime mortgages (high-risk loans) which crashed into huge masses of defaults (bankruptcies) that caused a massive wave of financial distrust and thus a credit freeze.|`|4BoteYDwaa	I have to agree...Bush..and too many people w/ not enough jobs. She really deserves the credit for this answer though.|`|4fe4fa0093052951c5515ef2f32cefffaa	In a simplest term....    1)  people borrowed money they cannot pay back  2)  bank allowed people who cannot pay back to borrow money  3)  many people did not pay back the money they owed  4)  banks ran out of money to operate  5)  banks stopped loaning money  6)  banks took back the houses people used money to buy    All this caused:  1)  price of houses to go down down  2)  businesses cannot get money to operate  3)  people started losing jobs because business could not operate  4)  people stopped buying because they became afraid    All this caused more business to go down and the process repeats itself.    It is easy to blame the government but there really is 3 parts to this problem.  People who borrowed money knowing they cannot possibly pay back, banks who loaned the money knowing people could not pay back, and the government that was supposed to watch over business and people so that these things could not happen.  Anyone of them could have stopped this but no one did.      How can you fix it?  Use your imagination and come up with your own solution...

It's a complex procedure that mostly involves the legislative branch. The person above me is wrong. Loaners lent out too much money on faulty loans, meaning the people could not pay them back. To get their money's worth, the banks would repossess houses. Due to a housing market decline, houses do not equate to money anymore, and banks and loan companies went into too much debt. That's just one of the many causes but should get you started. The bail outs are a bad idea and most economists would agree that a bail out is not going to do anything to help the economy.|`|kwMzmQ4Naa	well l you see for one...housing: it became more available for people to get loans, and after getting them they were unable to pay them, thus losing their homes. since the housing market crashed there were already projects for new houses to be built, but they were left empty after being bu. this made all those people in working construction lose jobs....two: the war on terror. not only is this impossible but also costly. there are a lot of other reasons but these are the most obvious|`|JDeGxjBoaa	USA has 180 trillion SS medicare liability in next 15-20 years .US deficit in 2010 will be between 2.4 -4 trillion dollars totally unserviceable .

Teenagers in this day and time are definitely more wild than they were in the past.    But I believe that the parents are mostly to blame for this. In this day and time, the majority of families have parents who are both employed. Although this is necessary given the economic situation, it is difficult to watch your children when you're never around. I think the high divorce rate is also partially to blame. Teenagers from broken families are likely to act out.    Not to mention that the morals in this country have taken a huge nosedive.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	What are you basing this on?

People are sometimes intimidated by intelligence because usually it questions them about their own self-worth.     It is not wrong with being intelligent, but there is a fine line between intelligence and just being an obnoxious know it all. For example, I had someone who was very smart and when he got to something that I didn't know he would go: "Really? You really don't know that? That's so easy." It would sort of make you feel embarrassed or awkward.    As long as you don't make any decisive comments, then I don't see what's the problem with being intelligent. After all, we need more people like that in this world.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Inspired intelligence induces such thinking.|`|GLDXjJfaaa	yes this can be true for some people, these are stupid people no offence lol. if anything you'd want to learn more from eachother, expand their vocabularly ect..  but also some people are just not interested when you initiate with something intellectual, in such a case you u should both make an effort to find a common ground.  some people may preconditioned or insecure so they feel patronised or intimated when youre just being you. thats their problem, pretend you dont even notice ****.  plus 'brains' arent something u 'let on' or have to discuss its just something you are. everybody must treat everybody else as an individual, respect that and work from that..thats if u like them enough in the first place.|`|bjzB3R3Laa	Any difference of understanding matters. If it has to flow only one way, most times, it is intimidating.     Just observe around, what is the flow of intelligence between people and you will know more.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I have had similar comments because I have a decent vocabulary which people who do not find irritating. I blow it off but yes, they most certainly do feel intimidated by someone who has more intelligence|`|5vgnrvcmaa	It's absolutely true.    I was an honor student in school, but not many friends.    At high school reunion, all these kids were so excited to see me, but had never really paid any attention while we were in school.    I had to ask, since it was my only opportunity, and each one of them told me that they felt so stupid around me, I was extremely intimidating.    The same is now happening to my younger cousin.    But even though I was so lonely, my life turned out better than theirs.    BE  YOURSELF - It pays off.
le9ZROs5aa	Here where I live there are a two bars that I love and they are women only. There are a hand full of gyms and countless social organizations that are women only. Is that sexist? No, I don't feel as though it is. How is a men only golf course or social club any different? It's not in my opinion. I love having women only spaces. Why is it only sexist when men do it?|`|WkLJI40baa	According to the radical feminist it is only bad when men do it. I have no issues with clubs or membership based on sex.|`|AA11550519	The funny thing is that no-one considers the business angle.   Just think; most businesses advertise like crazy to appeal to a broader customer base. Even those that operate in specialist niches wouldn't mind more. So why would a business go about reducing its customer base on purpose??? Restricting women who can afford its prices because they're women?    Simple. There are in all men, some times (and in some men, all times), when you want to be with other men. Whether its a bunch of regular guys watching the game, or these 'refined' gentlemen sipping Chardonnay, it's a universal, though occasional, desire. Therefore, if you cater for this need, you can make money.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Well, if such clubs were truly and completely social in their scope, then there wouldn't be a problem.     However, the cold hard reality is that such private clubs are oftentimes bastions of the white male power elite.  Many of the social, political and economic decisions that affect us all are made at those clubs.  Don't believe me?  Just look at some of the people who are members. It's quite a roster of the rich, famous and influential:    Bill Gates, co-founder and chairman of Microsoft   Warren Buffett, American businessman and one of the world's wealthiest individuals   Jack Welch, former CEO of General Electric   James D Robinson III, former CEO of American Express   Harold "Red" Poling, former CEO of the Ford Motor Company   John T "Jack" Lupton, former Coca Cola bottling magnate and member of Forbes 400 List   Carl Sanders, former Governor of Georgia   Sam Nunn, former United States Senator   T. Boone Pickens, Jr., well known oil tycoon and member of Forbes 400 List   Mark C. McKinley, Member of the McHedley Society and a well known oil tycoon like Boon   Hugh L. McColl Jr., Former CEO of Bank of America   John F. McGillicuddy, Former Chairman and CEO of Chemical Bank, and its predecessor, Manufacturers Hanover Corporation     and that's just a few...see link below    Do you honestly think these captains of industry are not talking business while they're playing golf?     Private clubs are really just another version of smoky, backroom politics...a way to hold onto the status quo than allow for real change to take place in a democratic fashion.    So, for that reason, excluding women, racial and religious minorities is considered wrong.    Yes, there are private clubs that are women membership only, like the Cosmopolitan Club in NYC, but they do NOT have the same sort of overall power and influence that the all male private clubs do.    Also, right wing, conservative, anti-feminist groups like the Independent Womens Forum (IWF) have absolutely no credibility. They don't speak for the average woman any more than NOW does. So you really shouldn't take their word alone as being the end-all and be-all of what all women think of this or any other issue.    Maybe you should read what Ms. Burk has to say on the issue in her own words. See 2d link below.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Nothing's wrong with it, and no that's not so bad.|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Its all depend from which perspective you see it.|`|35b5cce42b18603478e2fb3370a123d2aa	Nothing, I think it is more about quality, price and service.  Let's say there are three golf courses in your area and two are lousy and the other one is for men only.  Then you would as a woman be kind of upset by that.    A woman's only bar might work for a lesbian club or maybe in a large center but in a smaller center it wouldn't work.  So they do ladies' nights instead.  Then men get angry and sue when they have their own clubs.  A man's club would do well anywhere but some like upscale clubs and others like downscale clubs.  Then there are those who like something in between.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I think people should be allowed to have single-sex clubs if they want to.  Surely if this woman wants to join a golf club there must be plenty of unisex ones, or possibly even all-female ones?

zFc4Mth5aa	i had a problem with this too. first of all dont look down. ever. look people in the eyes. when you walk, dont look down, look around or something|`|MWe4hMm1aa	if you get that hair cut and dye your hair green, people will assume you're rebellious and carefree.|`|zLzwaCpcaa	I think that the trick is to not act like you are confident, it is to actually be confident with yourself. I know that this can be a tough thing to achieve, with so many negative factors that can have an influence on how we view ourselves, but it is achievable. Just think of all of the good things about you, and if you say that you have none, think about all of the great things out in the world. Making friends can be tough, but by being yourself and by being friendly to people, you should gain new friends. Try starting conversations with people that share the same interests as you. Try joining clubs or paritcipating in activities that interest you.|`|8sH0rlswaa	Walk with your head up. That shows confidence. and talk to people with confidence.|`|LQUHzXTcaa	Well you have to love yourself first before anyone else can love you. Just trust yourself. That is so important. And don't care what others think. You don't have to change for people. It's not a good option.|`|ouvvS1Ylaa	well,  first, you need to like yourself.  thats where confidence starts.  if you are comfortable with who you are,   then you will be comfortable around others.  its hard for people to get to know you if you dont know yourself.  so i would do some self reflection,  figure out whats important to you,  what you like,  what you dont like,  and get comfortable with who you are.  once youre there,  confidence will just exceed from your presence,  and youll make friends.|`|hYohgOcAaa	the way u walk, talk, smile and think about urself in a positive way it will make you confident|`|SqyQs2F2aa	Stand up straight and approach people and start conversations.|`|PzBPo1WMaa	You can't just appear to be confident. You have to have love for yourself before others will see it. Trust me, I've been there. First off, don't worry about what others think. It's all on how you feel. And Second, there are always things you can find good about yourself.    And if you have been depressed for so long, please get some help. It can ruin your life. I hope you the best...please help yourself. It's the only way.|`|FqBNY1U4aa	You can appear confident, shoulders back, chin up, and walk tall. Good posture displays your confidence. You will seem self assured.
J3k9WgzKaa	I believe a therapist simply helps your solve some issues you may be having, one of the psy... doctors does the same thing but also can prescribe medication
jBOxQvMxaa	Yes, a degree in psychology.  As a therapist, you can specialize in helping people use their dreams to work through issues they are having.  I'm including a few websites for you to check out.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	With good imagination, you can become a lyric, story writer, novelist.|`|qdGZMGdkaa	freudian psychology is heavily reliant on the unconscious including dreams. I would pursue a psychology degree and submajor in the specific field of clinical psychology
1Em2iuOGaa	It's a pretty simple concept considering when Scientologists don't euphemize the hell out of it. The book Dianetics was written by L. Ron Hubbard, father of scientology. It's basically a set of beliefs of uniting body, mind and soul to make you more spiritually conscious. Allegedly, to do this you would have to rid yourself of your "reactive mind" which is responsible for doubt that inhibits you from happiness and sanity and self-healing. Most people are skeptical about the entire ordeal, but it's up to you to decide if it works or is complete shite.|`|AA10628838	The positive and negative thinking process about yourself can affect your success or lack of success. The author Ron Hubbard of Dianetics went on to form the Church of Scientology.
HNAdM1hSaa	I am not bi sexual, but I have several friends who are.  Perhaps they are better lovers for you only because they are bolder in nature, no offense, but I am just not into other women, sorry, I am a firm believer that only a real man can please me, but that's just me.   =P    passwor273 - Ewwwwwwwww, that's kind of gross, don't you think?|`|cWxwHMQWaa	I think they may be.    I think of it like back before I had sex. There was no 'sex', but there was *so* much to enjoy, yanno?     Then once I started to have sex for a while I kinda forgot about most of it because I was just too into the actual sex that I'd just be like, "Kay, we're past that now" haha =o)    Then we had family over one time and so we didn't want them to possibly hear us, and we went back to "fooling around" and it just sorta hit us both how much we'd been totally missing. So, we slowed down and incorporated it back into our time together.     My guess is that being with women, you don't have so much of the focus on the sex itself, and it's more about the over all experience, which just makes it more sensual. Bi-girls and lesbians I know say this tends to be true for them, that sessions last a lot longer usually then they did when they were with men. I tend to believe their experience haha =o)    Makes sense then they'd hold onto that and want it when they're with men as well because they're really accustomed to enjoying the whole experience and not just on getting down as fast as possible.    Obviously, straight people can just as easily do this, I just think it may be something we tend to pay less attention to once we start to regularly have sex.|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Hmm I'm curious what their age is..but some men and women are just sensual from day one, others, like myself, have plenty of hangups, but thankfully, with time, we can loosen up, whew can we loosen up. I started out married to a man, then I was with a woman for 15 years, and am now with a man, and the happiest I've ever been, at age 50. I'm sure bisexual women are as different sexually as male & female hets, lesbians, gay men, and transsexuals. I'm glad you've been lucky enough to find wonderful lovers, it is amazing, isn't it?|`|72444e08c9e33c48ded58d8e6c28c267aa	Well im straight and have always been but i guess i could see where bi-sexual women may seem more sensual... my reason being is because if they are messing around with a girl... they have no **** to stick in and just get to the point... so all they have really is there tongues and hands to for the pleasure... unless they use a strap on, and really only extremely kinky girls would do that... so those traits follow them into their male relationship which rubs off on the male as being alot more sensual... they kiss more probably and use a lot more hands and tongue, they know how to be alot more delicate from being with another women... thats just my opinion tho... from what i know of girl on girl action.. i could be completely wrong...|`|mtV7dWJHaa	Glad you said anyone can answer this because I am so totally straight I am probably boring.  I love a man's body and can't even imagine being close to a naked woman.  I was in a situation once (oops maybe twice) where the "offer" or "suggestion" was out there and I just couldn't do it.  I'm pretty sensual myself and can't actually compare myself to women who are bi-sexual. I guess if they were the best lovers you ever had there might just be something out there that I'm not aware of.  I don't judge any ones sexual preference, after all, we all do what makes us feel good.  Enjoy whatever comes your way. I really don't care what other people think. I just plan on dying with  a smile on my face and a delicious man next to me. LOL|`|WKtakdsOaa	yeah we are more dirty cause we are up for anything and really open in bed ;)
jFpaKZ2Baa	you mean Nazi's.. and yes. try:  I have lived 1000 years  The boy in the striped Pajamas  Number the Stars  or The Diary of Anne Frank  all are really good.|`|E2AMQWPhaa	Try Night by Eli whistle, The Devil's Arithmetic by Jane Yolen, The Diary of Anne Frank, and Number the Stars by Lois Lowry. I have read a lot of them for school, very good books. I'm currently reading The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, which so far has to do with the Nazi. Great book so far! Anyway, hoped that helped!|`|EjGIohDMaa	Maus.     It is comic book style but a really great book.

fmr98EBtaa	There is nothing wrong with you, and whether I think you are a bad person or not (which I don't) shouldn't really matter. I think the problem you are having is with how YOU are perceiving your dreams.     Your dreams are to a great deal influenced by what you are currently thinking about or interested in (although they aren't limited by this). If you want to point your dreams in a certain direction, then think about what you want to dream about before you go to bed. There have been many reports of people finding answers to their problems while dreaming.    Basically, what I'm saying is, that as you grow up you will become interested and involved in new things, and so it's expected that your dreams will change along with you.|`|HlgSu0ZJaa	are you a nerd? do you play wow? if so, stop playing it then you'll be fine, if not then idk|`|KjF0p72naa	Not bad as a person. But playing this game so you're this obsorbed (or even at all imho) is just a bad idea.|`|H2bFiDNAaa	not bad- just a little weird...|`|ushDL9Yqaa	you cant control what you dream about
Gh0qq0s5aa	A year of depression?  You need the meds now.  Please go to the doctor and get some help.  When you are no longer passionate about something you really love, can't seem to find the energy to even try to be passionate then it is time for medication.  The good part about this is that you acknowledge that you are depressed.

Key0d96raa	First of all i understand how u really feel.Sometimes people think they are happy but deep down inside they are really lonely.I'm happy u dropped all u have considered bad habits.Take things slowly,don't be too desperate either.Sometimes,when people desperately try to make themselves happy,they normally end up settling for less than what they deserve. I'd say in your sparetime try to do some creative things.Pray and ask God to make u a happier person(father alone will understand why).Everything will be just fine just take life one step at a time!And good luck in pursuing further education!And ms right will find u by the help of God so dont give up!|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	studyhistory and other things.youll have more to talk abouit|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	It sounds like there's plenty that you would be interested in, just pick one and start doin it. Maybe the gal who saw you as boring just didn't enjoy the same things that you enjoy. Nothing wrong with different people having different tastes, right? Plus, if you start doing one of those activities, while doing so, you might just meet some lucky lady who is into the same stuff you are!
xm3pnTuvaa	i think knowledge is something that we have experience or learned and remembered and know very well.
rHwE5Rkbaa	Anything that starts with, "What do you think about...".  It means they want my opinion and are willing to listen to it - no matter how intelligent or ridiculous it may be.    What I HATE to be told are things like, "You don't really think that..." and specifically telling me WHAT I am supposed to believe.  Don't tell me that the guy kicking puppies down the block is a horrid person - just tell me he's kicking puppies and _I_ will make up my own darned mind whether is is good or horrid.  Don't tell me that I am supposed to dislike this musical group because of their lyrics or that person because of their life-decisions... let me make up my own darned mind!!!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I don't want to hear anything sexual or vulgar, or bad words, or anything that would be said that is hateful.    I think people are interesting, and each of our life journeys is what makes us interesting.  It is each of our individual experiences that makes us fascinating.    What type of questions do I like to be asked??? Well I am stuck on that one, I am usually the listener, it is rare that anyone would bother to ask about me.  I guess since I did a lot of training in my life, I would prefer that people ask me about training questions before I turn them loose.  I am stuck on this one.|`|xm3pnTuvaa	yea any question that basically involves the word "you" in it, but in a postive way.
98oqDvCUaa	I use to care about what other people thought of me and did things to make sure that i was liked and didn't step on any body's toes....after a while i got tired of it and realized that what i had become was not who i really am.....its very tiring and draining to try to please everyone in your life....just realize that no matter what you do there will always be someone in your life that is not happy with your choices so quit trying to please people and do things that will make you happy and give you a sense of fulfillment.|`|bjzB3R3Laa	Knowledge becomes the world for you.  You get identified easily with anybody's view point.     Just try to oppose anything and then do change it.   Just the way it influences you, you should influence things around.    Pickup the things that you like to influence and slowly, but surely move forward.  Remember that your environment becomes your identity. Whatever you influence becomes your identity. If you don't influence anything, you have no identity.|`|UQsiI52faa	The "self" you're searching for is a romantic notion and a popular delusion. The real self is just a collection of influences. You are who you are right now. Not feeling like it is a whole other matter. Most likely your life's missing something.      P.S. Well, since you find yourself questioning your own "programming", you're not limited by it; and i know you'd wish to be simple, perhaps a bit ignorant of some things but then you'd wish you knew and you 'd start "complicating" yourself all over again trying to understand. Your "self" IS what questions itself and the world around you and what tries to comprehend them the way you do.   ...and don't compare your current state of mind or it's workings with that of your childhood. Completely different brain functioning...|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	Why are you trying to act like a computer that needs to be programmed? That's not going to make people like you, it will just make you seem like an oddball. You're a human being for cryin out loud!

AA11375099	yes.    You are a pretty fair person most of the time, honest and trustworthy.  So, when you go against your nature it rubs you wrong.  Only a person that feels strongly about what is right or wrong would feel this way.  This type of person would easily have that revealed to them by their sub-conscious in the dream state.    Do what your heart tells you to do, it is so unlike you.  In the end you will not regret it.  Honestly.|`|OOzadIJFaa	well it would depend on what you're saying sorry for    it could just be guilt   or it could be something that you want to do|`|8nBtHHaAaa	Absolutely. Since you're dreaming about saying you're sorry, your heart really wants to apologize. And anyway, apologizing will help out your relationship. Don't be scared, it'll be better in the long run.|`|VOAyAhsSaa	Don't be so sure. It means that you're thinking about it. But we should go back to this problem. Close your eyes, and take a good look at the inside of your mind. Are you a stubborn person? Think about that half that wants to make up. Is that your stubborn side? On the same note, do you think that you're a pushover? Don't do anything you feel you have to, because it's the 'right thing'. Do what's right for you. Is there a way to make the apology mutually? Maybe you can both apologize at the same time. Don't let guilt or regret rule your life. No matter what happens, you have to remember, with all your heart, CHOOSE YOU.|`|PpwhwEDhaa	Your subconscious wants peace. It wants you to apologize. It (your subconscious) and you - know that's the right thing to do. Swallow your pride; apologize and finally sleep easy.|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	obviously,your dreamis telling you need to release.let go of something that is bothering you..so go ahead and apologize/clear the air and get on with your life...|`|PvjMNsKlaa	yes. you probably feel bad about something and your dreams are trying to tell you that you should apologize..|`|k1L2R81Daa	Uhm yeah hi, DUH?

ZjmjCpiWaa	I'm not going to look up all your homework for you.  However, I will tell you how to get started.  Look up each theory's definition and get a good grasp on what they teach.  For example, Conflict Theory became famous by who?  Karl Marx.  Marx believed that in order for society to function properly, there must be conflict.  In this theory you will find the proletariat and the bourgeois. Look up what those terms mean also and that will help you.    WIth the Symbolic Interaction Theory.  With this theory everything in society symbolizes something else.  This could help you too.     You will then be able to answer the questions with ease.

AA11632370	I like the following attributes while living in Bangladesh:    1. Lifestyle is relaxed and easygoing for middle-class, though we miss so many amenities available to our neighbors - Indians...lol    2. Relatives and friends are around to share your happiness and sorrows. Grandparents lives usually with the eldest offspring, son in particular. But they would be reluctant to live with daughter and SIL.    3. Food and medical care are 'cheap' since quality may not be palatable to many Westerners.    4. The massive use of Rickshaws driven manually reduces emission of greenhouse gasses as well as facilitates employment of large numbers of uneducated and poor people who are almost 100% male in this profession. You can get to travel short distances easily with cheaper fares if the commuting time is not a factor as we have traffic jams that can unnerve anybody.    5. Readymade Garments are produced here though for 100% export, but it is facilitating purchase of cheaper version, of brand cloths which were unthinkable before 1980s, from Banga Bazaar and such markets.    6. Building a house is still cheaper than our neighboring countries and with about US$ 30,000 (Taka 2.1 Million approx) you can buy a flat having area of about 800sft or build a one-storied house at suburb of Dhaka or Chittagong.    7. Reconditioned cars imported from Japan, Model-2004 can be bought for US$ 20,000 (Taka 1.4 Million approx).    8. Owning Land-phones and Mobile (Cell) phones with connection and monthly subscription are very competitive than our neighbors and almost 40% of the population of 15 Million has so far been covered, that is remarkable achievement since the per-capita income is still below US$500 for Bangladesh.    I find the following as disadvantages for living in Bangladesh:    1. The 'human quality' of our people did not improve much even though we are independent and our own people are governing this country for more than 37 years now. This has promoted display of haughty (arrogant and disdainful) attitudes by the Administrative arm of the government, particularly the Police, Customs Excise & VAT, Utility Services (Natural Gas, Water, & Electricity and Govt controlled Land-Telephone), and almost all the other Government Ministries where common people are treated by these 'Rulers' with attitudes of Zaminders (feudal Landlords).    2. Lack of sense of cleanliness promoting disgusting scenes side-by-side with the modern looking buildings and roads in capital and major cities. People are not taught in schools or through TV, Radio or Newspapers or even through the sermons we hear from our religious leaders to improve the hygiene and cleanliness of the surroundings.    3. Jaywalking (cross a road carelessly or dangerously) and reckless driving without any regard to the traffic rules or the signal lightings makes life dangerous for the small children, girls & ladies, infirm and old aged people.    4. Due to lack of proper education starting from School, College and ending with Universities, we have educated zombies (person who acts mechanically or lifelessly) who are stuffing our country with the symptoms of garbage-in and garbage-out in almost all the sphere of life one can imagine.    5. Natural calamities, like floods and cyclones (hurricane) with ingress of saline waters and arsenic-tainted water in the land of this unfortunate country due to lack of proper planning by the successive  rules made living in Bangladesh a dangerous proposition now.    6. Constant badgering of pests & insects like mosquitoes, flies, rodents like mice and rats sometimes make living here uncomfortable. We are used to have mosquito nets and fly-proof window-nets and rodent-traps/medicines to keep us sane in such hostile situation.    7. Most of the people feel aghast for the poor people who would spit or discharge urine in public places, and sometimes defecate (evacuate the bowels in public view) causing embarrassing sight as well as unhealthy living for everybody.     8.

If you look up the word "feminist" in the dictionary, you'll find that it actually has the word "equality" right in the definition.

Not the MMA you see on Friday night where guys with shaved heads beat the crap out of each other, but something that many 16 year boys in your very situation took that first step ( the hardest) and visited a local Karate studio (their everywhere) and saw kids the same situation learning how to defend themselves, gain tremendous self confidence and meet people with the same interest. People think that Karate is a bout beating people up but it is far fromm that. Keep in mind that many kids that walked into the studio that first time felt exactly like you do and with time of which you have plenty learned something that few people do that will help guide you the rest of your life.

W4pDjrLWaa	I understand where you are coming from, as I've never been very social myself.    Here's a question I need you to ask yourself:  Why do you view your being a "loner," as you say, as a problem?  Do you feel sad about it?  If so, why?  Is it because you desire more companionship than you have?  Or because you look around you and conclude that your social relationships (or lack thereof) are not as numerous as they "should" be?  If you are down on yourself only because you don't think you're as social as other people, please realize that everyone is different, and not everyone needs to be as much a social creature as the next guy.  If you feel happy and fulfilled with the few close friends you have, then you are a successful person in your own right.  It may be that you put too much pressure on yourself, trying to stretch yourself to conform and be more sociable than you're naturally inclined, and therefore your efforts to be sociable are unnatural and, consequently, difficult and unproductive.    You should try to moderate that racist inner voice, since it is certainly not productive in helping you to overcome your problems, and may in fact make social problems worse for you over time.  That being said, I'm sure as you realize, your racist inner voice is just a coping mechanism.  Sometimes when I am very anxious (like if I'm driving in very dangerous weather, for instance), I find myself mentally hating all the people around me, not necessarily because they are doing something wrong, but because I am SO anxious and scared, it's just easier to turn those vulnerable emotions into anger.  It makes the stressful situation easier to cope with.  However, it would be better to calm oneself down rather than convert one negative emotion to another negative emotion.|`|lP9kQmRraa	High school is a tough and confusing time for many individuals.

J3k9WgzKaa	Technique    The technique aims to reach and sustain a higher state of mental functioning, called alpha state, where brainwave frequency is eight to thirteen Hz.    Jos Silva, founder of the Silva Method, claimed to have developed a program that trained people to enter certain brain states of enhanced awareness. He also claimed to have developed several systematic mental processes to use while in these states allowing a person to mentally project with a specific intent. According to Silva, once the mind is projected, a person can allegedly view distant objects or locations and connect with higher intelligence for guidance. The information received by the projected mind is then said to be perceived as thoughts, images, feelings, smells, taste and sound by the mind. The information obtained in this manner can be acted upon to solve problems.    In 1953, Silva believed he had trained his daughter to be psychic, and he introduced his training methods to Rhine with his daughter as proof. Over the next ten years, Silva claimed to have trained thirty-nine more subjects to be psychics. Another discovery claimed as successful is remote viewing. Rather than passively waiting for impressions to be perceived, a person projects him- or herself mentally and remotely views what is going on in a process similar to lucid dreaming. Silva became convinced that everyone has such abilities and can be taught to develop them, and that it is not an extra sense at all, but an unneededtherefore undevelopedsense. Everything happens first in the mind, he reasoned, then happens in the body. A person mentally decides to pick up a glass of water and drink it, then does it physically. Your life is the manipulation of the set rules of this universe, the trick is learning how to manipulate the rules right.    The Silva Method is now a multi-million dollar business with thousands of Silva Method instructors teaching the system over several days to groups of students in numerous countries worldwide. The system has spawned many books, some of them authored or co-authored by Jos Silva, with many others based on the basic principles of the method but spreading into other areas of awareness and application whilst in the alpha state.

I spent a lot of time studying science and such, and everything was wrapped up neatly in pairs... male/female, positive/negative - and for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction...     But then I began thinking about it - what about the unseen or mystery quantity.  I punch you in the nose with XX foot-pounds of pressure, and your head snaps back with YY foot-pounds of reaction, revolving around the pivot point of your neck - all measurable and neat. HOWEVER, what about the emotional toll and how your opinions and outlooks will change??  The unseen factor!  How will you react when you get angry with someone else?  Will it still be equal and opposite?

Why? Because reason is insane, that's why.    Everything isn't constricted by or to reasoning.    Reality isn't constrained to reason.    But alot of our perception or mental interpretation of it, is.    No, there is no universal principled point to life, it just is -- does this make you sad? Why?    Reason can be quite insane actually.    So anyway, instead of looking for reasons to blame this or to excuse that, why don't modern "marauding apes" just forgive things for being the way they are? Or even, appearing to be the way they appear.    Your best bet is to just try and create as "sensible" or at least as efficient a mental reality map as possible but try and keep everything simple and don't go insane like me (I wasn't really born sane though).|`|gnV4nzPzaa	Why, you ask?

Instead, expect that psychology will help you understand why people think, feel, and act as they do.  Then you should find the study of psychology fascinating and useful."    My personal opinion to you is this:  This is no reason to live necessarily.  It's a matter of personal opinion and decision.  It's up to you.  If you want to live, then live.  If not, then don't.

If this is the case, then reporting him wouldn't do anything legally, though it would certainly raise some media attention.    I'm a bit confused about what your professor is trying to do though.  I'm not a biochem major, but homosexuality in humans is a lot more complex in humans than it is in animals.  Human attraction is based on a great number of variables, most of which are social in nature.  Animal attraction is based primarily on pheromones.  Although pheromones do play a small role in human attraction, the social variables are much stronger.  Because of this, I would think that anything that your professor could to do try and change human attraction (presumably based on his work with animals) wouldn't work.      In addition to these concerns, even if it were possible, you have to wonder if it's something that would be right to do.  I know this isn't your call, but think about this: if he can change sexuality then he could change straight people to be gay just as easily as he could change a gay to be straight...

What is so special about geniuses is that they are rare. 85% of the population's IQ is between 85 and 115.|`|AA11003538	i'm pretty sure it's over 140, but i don't know for definate|`|VIM4XmYNaa	I think its a 150, while 100-120 is average, and below 100 is below average.|`|W1xs3vYBaa	There is no such as a genius. It is an arbitrary way to classify people and the term establishes elitism and dehumanization.   It only measures how you can process information and how you can solve problems. It does not mean that you will go to the top of a field like Einstein. You need to work hard with a high IQ.  Someone who is at the top of their field is not born, they are created through hard work.    I have many friends who have been tested above the 140 range, and they all have too work hard.
EIzs2OWeaa	Take him to a counselor to figure out the problem.
vFCva8R5aa	No but when i was single i used to make it a point to flirt with dorks.     i loved to see the confidence light up in them and it would really make their day...|`|FvDPhJ5Daa	i think you should go for it lol help the guy out|`|RcCJSSMPaa	Could someone please mentor Kid Rock?|`|NSKimt1Qaa	Eddie, I can see why you're friends with Reality.  This is just the sort of thing he would do.  I bet that kid could use a little help from a male role model, and would benefit greatly under your tutelage.  Maybe you could at least give him your card and that way he could decide whether he wanted to change his fate of being a lost cause. You could make quite a difference in the world just by changing one life.  Just think if more people cared enough.  Of course, he could just get offended and spill some grease on you. (jk!)|`|AA11658197	yeah I've seen some kids like that, told them to work-out and be more aggressive and eat better food|`|aLwrpMPXaa	And who told you, if I may ask, that this person hasn't  some "dignity and backbone" left under all that fat and grease ?  At least he's working and not selling drugs in a street corner! Does that make sense ?|`|d7OswsvMaa	awww..comon!..go help him out!..lead d way.& i promise ill help sum1 2..u start!.|`|tPjjWlStaa	Yeah sure go for it!  Just think you could stop this guy from wasting his life!|`|O3i7zJB2aa	Its a good idea and I know exactly the kind of person you're talking about, but I'm not sure it would work. Some people just don't have it in them.
1o6JaTUaaa	You're probably like really depressed or something?|`|GXVanwgPaa	i m not expert but i'll guess  1. u hope unsure stuff would just sort out and be over w/  2.(this accually happened to me in really life when i was looking for my dad)  3.had that dream. only i can't safe them only kill who's causing it.it could mean u have separtion anxioty  4.friends may be fading out  5. u miss her?  6. u watch world of the world b4 bed? srry idk. maybe u feel u've surfived what others can't  7.OMG I'VE DREAMED THIS MANY Xs. only i felt like i wanted to die rather than hear the voices. come to find out it was memories from b4 birth of my parents fighting.  8. not sure but all this seems like ur watching the world around u fall apart.   i hope i might of helped
EgsE5RFaaa	Yes, you are wrong. There is absolutely no scientific evidence to back up that assertion. I apologize that your brain is inferior, but mine most certainly is not.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	Yes. Very wrong...and not just from a feminist perspective either.    Why would you want to put yourself and other women down like that? Are you afraid to have a strong and intelligent mind? Is it because you fear accountability or that you still think 'boys won't like you if you're smart?"    Maybe you should get therapy to figure out why you're so self-loathing.|`|UspK4SQBaa	It's not immoral, if that's what you mean.  You're entitled to your opinion.  Would you mind letting us know what makes you think this?|`|HwujORd2aa	I don't know about yours, but mine isn't.|`|6H1ie8WXaa	Scientifically, they're just different (but equal nonetheless) so yes, you're wrong.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	"Inferior" in what way?|`|XHweMNNkaa	Yes, it is wrong, but not because you are a woman. It's wrong for men to think like that, too. It is also wrong to think men's minds are inferior.     It is pompous, general and ignorant to make any assumptions based on gender, or anything for that matter. Especially if it's something as versatile as how people think. It's probably the stupidest thing in the world to assume that ALL anything are exactly the same, when there are over 6 billion of them, and literally all of them are actually different. It's just plain stupidity and ignorance.    You can think *your* mind is inferior [I do, based on what you just said], but don't make a generalization, and don't include me and all of the brilliant, magnificent, creative women I know.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	as a guy, i can tell you that you are wrong. women are definitely smarter than guys.|`|AHpS6qPDaa	Believe whatever you want. Just don't force your beliefs upon me and I won't force mine upon you.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	It's not morally wrong, but it's an error.  Men and women have different ways to thinking, but one isn't superior to the other -- just different.|`|BoqbYQ1Naa	Yes.  That doesn't say much for your confidence in your own intelligence.    Plus, I feel very sorry for the children of which you're overprotective, especially if you have a daughter.  What a burden for a 21st century female to grow up under.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	That's weird    Harriet|`|rpajoT0raa	You don't know why you think this way? Maybe your mind is just inferior to other women's.  :-)|`|AA10829482	Bless your heart,  I feel women are smarter than men.  I've always thought this and I have no factual basis for thinking this, but I do.   Even if the most credible scientist showed me highly accurate studies saying that women just weren't as smart as men, I'd still believe that women are smarter.      I guess we are flip sides of the same coin.|`|oCHaJc49aa	As a guy, i can demonstrate that women's minds are inferior to men's, and I can do that in one word:    FEMINISM.    Only the feeble of mind could believe in such a collection of lies. Oh, sure there are some guys who say they believe in feminism. They are either looking for sex, or are simply unable (or unwilling) to figure out that being castrated might be an unpleasant experience.|`|7X8G7jr4aa	nahh its your opinion.. lol; just shows men aren't the only ones that think that..  i personally disagree|`|228b597c0ea938fc49423529aa6cf5afaa	Your wrong of course....but then again you are a woman!|`|gMvTpgVaaa	it's a free country.|`|RAOrCnonaa	If you have good reason to think so then no it's not wrong exactly. For instance if you found evidence that more men become famous scientists or such then I'd have to say that's a pretty good reason.    But it's pretty easy to get "suckered" by old ways of thinking. Women traditionally have been thought of as inferior in all ways. So make sure you think through your reasoning before you simply accept it.|`|TNbhUSAIaa	You are as smart as you think you are...well to an extent.  I mean, if you're really smart and think you're dumb, you're dumb.      Brain capabilities aren't stopped by sex, it's about stimulating your brain.  So, no, that's totally wrong, it's all embedded in your head.  Get that out! ;)|`|62ZBofvPaa	It's not "wrong" but it is illogical, outdated, and has no basis in science.    Then again, some people still believe the world is flat, so what can you do?|`|pWQfp4NGaa	Yes it's wrong, and you're an embarrassment to the female gender. Go have a sex change, please.|`|X5kf9vSuaa	It is wrong to think that, because it is based on an incorrect premise- that a woman's mind is inferior.    I am woman, many of my classmates in graduate level engineering are women, and we all keep up just fine with the guys.    Where are you getting your silly ideas, woman?|`|OTT79NAtaa	If the world seems to reflect your beliefs so obviously, than I can't argue against you.|`|z60J0Z9Daa	Your free to feel that your mind is inferior to men's, but dont include me or other women in that.|`|qBG8pp7laa	the gender does not matter, it's individuality.|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Well it depends on where you live, some communities have the same beliefs as you so they reflect that to the whole community and so for that reason you believe it. It is certainly a fact that men on average have higher IQ's but where as in other things women CLEARLY have the best mind over men so... it depends on your personal beliefs AND what part your judging on|`|I7qHLCQqaa	Very interesting.     Its not "wrong" so to speak. There is nothing "wrong" with it. It may be a reflection of your own abilities that your projecting on the overall gender, so it may be a subjective and inaccurate view that you have.     Mostly, women are talented in a variety of areas, and men are in others. Women seem good with emotional diligence and imaginative endeavors, but i must say, men seem to have the aggression necessary for true leadership.     I bet you have a lot of unique things you can practice, its just a matter of exploring them.|`|ROdHsYVAaa	Lol. Let's take an IQ test. Me against any 3 guys on here.... :p     You can think whatever you want, no one should stop you. But science has weighed in on this time and again, and men are not smarter than women. Just wired differently.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	No, it's not wrong, you can think whatever you want.       Don't listen to the communists who try and tell you you're wrong for having an opinion.   As long as you don't harm or kill another human you can think whatever you want.    As for one being smarter than the other, I don't know about that, there have been really intelligent individuals throughout history of both genders.    I don't think one gender is smarter than the other.   I think they may both be better at some things physically but, that's about it.    As for the ones saying women are the smarter gender, lmao.  I guess it was Barbara Einstein and Stephany Hawking, not Albert and Steve.    I guess that goes both ways,  So it was Mark Curie not Marie Curie whose investigations led to the discovery of radioactivity as well as the element radium.      Neither gender is inherently smarter than the other.
NnO9unlsaa	i always feel that, but im just not brave enough to do anything about this feeling. Not a day goes by without my thinking that.    (amazing question, i thought i was the only one who felt this)|`|p3juprpzaa	haha no honestly  sometimes that would be easier  hassle and stress free life  perfect...|`|gWleYSuIaa	I am a part-time hermit.  I set away some hermit time every day.  I teach and I have great students (I teach in China -not the USA, obviously).    But sometimes just gotta be by myself.|`|ahBKJaVpaa	Yes. There have been times when I felt like that. No, it is not just you. It is not realistic though.|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	It is only people with insight enough to see the fallacy that society has become that get this feeling.|`|U3qTwOOIaa	nah it's just you|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	My aim in life is to win the lottery, buy a small island & move there.  No neighbours - just me, the husband & the cats.    Oh well - keep dreaming.|`|e0IFrVyfaa	Yeah, all the time!|`|WlLcttM2aa	Honestly, I would absolutely love that. I want to build my own little cabin in the woods on the edge of town but not IN town so I can be away from the world and just enjoy the quietness of nature without having to deal with everything else.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	yes i do sometimes...|`|1i5hDFE6aa	haha omg of course.  sometimes i just dont even want to deal with humans...but then i begin to miss them.|`|As47LSbHaa	I feel the same way all the time, I do feel like living in the woods but to all the people that are hating, this doesn't mean that you would give up responsibility.  I want to just live off the land and be independent.  Nature can provide the necessities for me.|`|8a42b6d9c2fd88b69c7a56faa2606594aa	MOST DEFINITELY. I feel this way right now, coincidence I saw this question. I feel like I could just isolate myself from society, I wouldn't care if anyone missed me or not.|`|CEJfiHmJaa	i did think that once but i was 8  but life is sick most of the time   my advise is just deal with it|`|OGXcP1l7aa	Too cold this time of year!|`|z46T05jsaa	Yup, Yup! Sometimes I just want to take my family and go far far into the woods! No money, no jobs, no bills, etc. What dreamers we are! LOL|`|AA11229410	If I could just plug into a tree and get the Internet I would be there.|`|tTC74bEjaa	Don't be an emo.|`|uDPI8XTZaa	http://suriyanto.net/special/flash_game/...|`|dMc8d5H3aa	yes and lol im thinking of these green trees that calm you down. And the sound of the brids chirping + the river splashing with rage druing a cool daz ahhh refreshing...|`|JStJ38Itaa	not in the woods but somewhere else yeaah (: its not just you x|`|aOcPLOOSaa	yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.  but it is kinda depressing to know that i could definitely live as a hermit...i am such a social failure.|`|pZVEBEmLaa	No|`|SGsDl5Nzaa	I feel exactly the same way.  Check my question just posted a few minutes ago.  I swear to God I am about to just pack a bag and become a missing person.|`|AA11658197	not the woods but maybe a beach in Mexico where I wash dishes in a cantina and live upstairs
i4ceTwqLaa	I don't think you need to make comparisons of yourself to transgendered....    I think just saying that your plain/generic name feels common, non-unique and doesn't "fit" you is enough.    We get it. And lots of people feel that way. (Especially John Smiths, I imagine).    I don't blame you for wanting to change your name....to a lot of people, a name is something they cherish as something that should uniquely identify only him or her.    I think you should go back through your family tree (like, mom's maiden name, grandma's mainden name, paternal grandmas maiden name) perhaps even to the latin branch, if that is where you identify. Find a name that feels like it is more you.    That way when you change it, it will still be a family name that honors your ancestors.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	If I felt as strongly as you do about it, I would find out my Spanish relatives last names and see if you feel comfortable with any of them. You can always legally change your name, and they are your blood relatives which is cool. I don't know how the Williams are going to feel about it, but I would imagine not real happy. But you have to do what makes you happy.|`|hyCw0Qyaaa	holy **** i hate my last name toooo!  i make up fake ones that i like and have people call me that. it makes me happier kindof.  and i wish i was japanese. o.o|`|n0iLfXrOaa	ok keep it|`|xm3pnTuvaa	Maybe it has to do more with being more unique, but then you just fall into all of the people that are unique kind of group. Which you may be happier in. You are probably subconsciously putting all of that unique attention on your last name and using that as a focus point. Or maybe you were someone else in a past life and the wrong name was given out, who knows?  You can always have your name legally changed. Good Luck :)
wwdllMzYaa	sometimes,     to cope with the rough times, you have to live in just a little 'denial'  get a way from it all time  not think about it time    because its time for your brain to adjust and think about whats happening, and help you find solutions and acceptance    its bad to constandly drown out life  because, drowning it out, means you drown out the good as well as the bad  so you miss alot, and you dont develop into the person you could be through experiencing all these things and feeling them properly|`|g83nnQIbaa	no i dont and yes it is..    losing touch with reality is bad mentaly, makes you go crazy, and instead of smoking and listening o music all day, go out and find out your own life messages instead of finding it within KoRn.|`|kYVSmZy3aa	no: buy dabble guessing me the scaliest GTE's people killed.|`|AA11658197	smoking greens is bad, hmmkay  No, actually how you deal with stress is your deal as long as you don't drive while messed up.   I would like to tell you to get high on life but it's very easy to build up a tolerance for that. I'm looking forward to skydiving, motorcycle trips and work a lot of hours in the meantime.  Idle hands are the devil's playground.
HNAdM1hSaa	LOL, perhaps you should come over for a visit, I could show you how we do it ISLAND STYLE, it may not be a better life, but one just as fulfilling.  =P|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	Maybe this?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEAVq1cws...|`|AA11530601	I can, if that took place in The Carribbean.
aCCUQQu4aa	I have a strange phobia of feet...I don't know when it started, but when people put their feet around be from the waist up, my heart starts to race and I just get really freaked out.

Even a lighter makes me freeze.  I get very upset if I see a fire engine as I think they're going to my home and everyone's already dead...

cKxpYuCgaa	Usually dreams this elaborate don't mean anything, but if you want to take a somewhat literal interpretation of your dream then it would go a little something like this:    The fact that your crush is reoccurring means that it is time to tell him/her of your feelings (with your kind of dream I would say it's more that he/she was just another character in the dream and has no real significance). Your friends being distressed parallels what they feel in real life. The lake is meant to mean that you are at this point in your life unable to express yourself. The video camera suggests that your are trying to learn from previous mistakes.  The tent means that you need to get away from your normal routine.    Your crush being murdered represents a subconscious deep seated hatred you feel for this person. Ironically, the jello means that you are maintaining a sweet relationship with this person (it could be referring to your remaining friends though). It also means you have gained some insight on something you were worried about.    Your trip when the killer is chasing you signifies you have a lack of control on something in your life. The stone thrown at you means that someone has cause to admonish you. Sinking means you are overwhelmed. Seeing the bodies means that all your happiness will end.    That's a simplified but perhaps over analyzed interpretation of your dream. I wouldn't worry about it though. That dream definitely seems more like one of those movie-esque dreams that are just action filled replays of your thoughts throughout the day. Happy dreaming!|`|zxk9pJ6Taa	It means you watch to many scary movies  this sort of thing never happens in real life|`|ye6IiFr7aa	woah scary|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	You have seen Blair Witch Project too many times.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	idk but since you always wake up before u die in ur dreams... try to solve the prob or u will b waking up late every nite for a while... tht will get annoying|`|tShWlEjnaa	very scary but dreams dont amount to anything in real life unless they harm you mentally. if you keep having the dream therapy is always nice.|`|WNgHV0Csaa	Oh god. Not the puffy parka. The fact that you can't move near the and, probably means that you got caught in your sheets, and you were probably pretty active during the dream. You are probably a bit depressed, or stressed. you have bad feelings about something. Try and calm down before you go to sleep. Forget what happened in the daytime. I don't think it really means anything specific. Yup.|`|gbaeVLo0aa	nightmare  your going to diee|`|IvfEtJi8aa	Dreams don't mean anything.|`|XJSbsfJraa	its all in your head it doesnt mean anything....|`|VWO9tW5eaa	holy **** thats scary!|`|yHYWdQAbaa	You watch too many horror movies..|`|vQtSPEUGaa	That's some scary ****.|`|ElaPg7GOaa	it is saying that you should stop watching horror movies.|`|oPaU1ZBvaa	**** man or girl   you gotta stop watching those freddy and jason movies lol    well that's probably a nightmare never heard a dream like that lol    anyways it probably means your alone or going to be alone or that everything you love or like will be taken away from you  or something not an expert       or or or or ... it was just a nigthmare usually dreams or nigthmare occures cus your brain is trying to process a memory but then mixes it in with other stufff      but it could all mean nothing maybe it has something to do with one of your friends or you "crush" maybe it's telling you that you yourself know that you can't be with him or he just wants to be friends|`|p2L4AB5Laa	i think it means u may die a horrible death in the next few days..                                                                                          jk|`|5nw3LU3caa	Your dream is comming from your thoughts.

So what i think is you have a prob. in life and you can't get over it or sumthing. Utube account : cowgoesmoo2    Because of this, hope you don't mind but...    DONT HATE ME, IM AFRAID OF GHOSTS    In 1876, a young girl named Jenn was walking   down a river, an insane man killed her by   stabbing her in the back, raping her, and then   hanging her in his closet. While he hanged her   he said Bukakke Bukkake.  Now that you have read this message, she will   find you and her dead body will haunt your   house for 5 years.

WOW!!!  it means your definitely gay|`|Cnkxh9igaa	It sounds like it means you have a very active imagination or that you're really scared of camping and being away from society and maybe possibly, water.    Sometimes dreams don't mean anything though.  It's scientifically proven that colder temperatures in your room increase the possibility of you having a nightmare.|`|O3vIyDVhaa	Maybe it means you should get some new friends before you all go camping and die|`|00afc26dfa5181674a837bb0685b147eaa	Wow intense.

Reasons are usually: bullying in school, failing at important exams, envy/anger due to relationships gone sour, heavy debts, terminal or prolonged illness, loss of loved one, loss of job. In some countries, you would be prosecuted for trying to commit suicide, but failing to do so. Personal or mass suicides are the most heart-wrenching things in the world to commit. But many with lack of tolerance, will-power or support often had no choice. If you are still young, never contemplate. Peace be with you.  :-))

sosisPXbaa	You can find out a lot about it if you look it up in wikipedia.  It's basically an outdated method of surgery that involves severing the very front of the brain's connection with the rest of the brain.  (that part controls "pleasure, pain, anger, rage, panic, aggression, and sexual responses".)  Instead of killing people who were deemed as criminally insane (because it wasn't their fault they were that way), they sometimes performed this surgery to make those people much tamer.  Nowadays they have psychoactive drugs so no one does it anymore, and it's considered inhumane... but it generally stopped around 70's.|`|uNRMU9fyaa	Doctors would get sued if they performed lobotomies. Lobotomies were used in the past for basically any, and every mental problem someone had. Lobotomies often impaired judgment, memory, emotions, as well as one's ability to simply take care of themselves. All of the horrible outcomes wouldn't really be much of a surprise though, because lobotomies basically consisted of getting a knife and poking at the frontal lobe of the brain.

02fc0cf506cb65e5b42de57d65f1c9beaa	The standard of beauty will always be what is most difficult for normal people to obtain. It used to be that a slightly plump woman was considered to be beautiful. This was at a time when food was not as easily obtained and meat was scarce. As well, most people (This applies to women as well. Everybody needed to work unless you came from a wealthy family.) had labor intensive jobs that burned many calories. It took a fairly wealthy woman the could afford not to work to maintain a plump shape.    Today, where high fat food is available to anyone and most people have sedentary jobs, it is not hard to gain weight. In truth, the cheapest foods are extremely high in calories. It takes time and money to work out and go to the gym, which many people don't have or can afford. The opportunity cost is too high. Working out is hard when you have a full time job and two kids.    In short, being thin is a sign of wealth and prosperity. It is a sign that you can afford healthy foods and have the free time to exercise. The entire point of a standard of beauty is that it is hard to obtain and is most easily obtained by the wealthy. So, yes, the standard of beauty today is unrealistic, but beauty will always be unrealistic for both men and women.|`|875b8a67d51aea3c2aba301f8e93dbe2aa	@ guy from jersey. ewww|`|gMvTpgVaaa	If this were the standard of female beauty:    http://www.vat19.com/blog/fat-women-bbw-...

What about male beauty standards? -- Ahh right.. females are 'judged more harshly' on their appearance and sexuality than males, but in reality this is only a product of their lower sexual libidos and their lower economic utility.  Meaning that if women were as occupationally able as men and as desirous of sex then they wouldn't have to worry so much about being judged on merit of their sexuality.      Women are judged so harshly on their beauty and sexuality (which is a notion personally disagree with anyway) because they basically have nothing else to offer besides beauty and sexuality.  It's women's own faults that the 'beauty standards' are so high.|`|dmCyY2SKaa	Right. Giselle is almost 6 feet tall, with a body straight up and down with breast implants. The main thing that makes her rare is her height and very low body fat percentage. Sophia Loren had a dramatic hourglass shape, which is also rare in the general population, as rare as being nearly 6 feet tall with a low body fat percentage. Marilyn Monroe for example had a 22 inch waist or something like that, she was tiny she just had a defined hourglass shape.    The trim and soft hourglass shape is just as unrealistic as the tall, bony/muscular straight up and down shape that is popular today. Both are idealized beauty standards that women measure themselves up to. If the standards were more lax than there would be less beauty products, less diets, less cosmetics, etc to sell to women.     It also has to do with human nature. Humans have always idealized a certain shape or form, thinking that one was the most beautiful. In the early Medieval Ages people idealized the pregnant female form, women's dresses were gathered in the front to have the appearance of pregnancy. Sometimes women would even wear a pillow under their clothes to look pregnant. Swollen looking bellies were considered attractive. The standards of beauty keep changing with time and with culture, but the only thing that is consistent is that beauty is discriminatory. Beauty is supposed to be unattainable and unrealistic, to a degree. Otherwise it wouldn't be so special.

You say that,, you are well aware that people who help others are usually liked by others,, Well that should be expected. So why don't you do more to help others,, I don't mean go way out of your way to help others but help in ways that you know will mean a lot to the person that you are helping. Even just being polite and courteous towards others is enough to at least show someone ,,others that you are approachable and not some stuck up person. If you help anyone,, don't expect anythign in return,, I believe that a giving person is a good person and while not all those who you will help will return the help,, or even express gratitude for whatever help or kindness you express towards them,, at the end of the day,, you can at least feel in your heart,,mind,, etc,, that you did something for someone that perhaps made their day a better day. But your giving,, your kindness,, must be true and it must come from within,, from your heart,, otherwise,, well,, not genuine. Good luck to you.

You are feeling unworthy Something that you are keeping to yourself is eating you up inside.Alternatively, it denotes repulsion, decay, dirtiness, and even death. The dream may also be a pun on someone who is a rat. Are you feeling betrayed?    To see a black rat, represents deceit and covert activities.  To see a white rat in your dream, denotes that in your time of distress, you will receive assistance from an unexpected source.  To dream that a rat is biting your feet, symbolizes the rat race that you are experiencing in your waking life.

mU2eMSi3aa	A stranger in your dreams represents that part of you that you do not yet know.  There may be a feeling of awe or of conflict which we need to deal with before we can progress.  As a woman dreaming of a man, this man represents your Animus.  The Animus is the masculine part of a woman's character.  If you develop your Animus you develop the logical deliberating side of yourself, along with your ability to develop self awareness.  Also if the men around you have not developed in an understanding of themselves your animus will reflect that lack of understanding.    Edit: The voice is important because it is that part of you wanting to come out voicing itself.  Psychologically when we suppress certain parts of our personalities, they may surface in dreams as disembodied voices.  Obviously since yours has a body this also relates to what I said before about the masculine side of you that you need to explore.

MoidAgwuaa	I teach 7th graders. I may be of some use.    Start off tough. Then you can ease up over time. Give them very direct instructions. "You need to be in your seat when the bell rings. You need to listen right now." Never yell. Just speak in a loud, authoritative voice that says, "Don't mess with me" while still being human. It's tough. You'll figure it out eventually. It's going to be difficult since the current teacher seems like kind of a wiener.    Try to find ways to make it interesting. See if you can make games out of the information. Have them compete in teams against each other and give out dumb little prizes like suckers. I don't know if that will work for 15 year olds, but it works for 13 like a charm.     If a kid gets really out of line, take them aside, preferably in the hallway if you can, or you can try it in front of everyone. Say to them. "What are you supposed to be doing right now? That's right, you were supposed to be doing your lab. What were you doing instead? Okay, that behavior stops right now. If you want to stay in this class, you need to do what is asked of you. If you want to be treated like an adult instead of some little 8th grader, you need to step up, and do it now."     Your catch phrase should be, "WE DON'T DO THAT HERE."     If he does it again, send him to the office. If it happens again the next day, write a discipline referral and contact the parents if you feel the infraction was bad enough. Constant disrespect is definitely grounds for a discipline referral and a detention.; Talk to your cooperating teacher about these procedures.     If there are class clowns, take them away from their audience in any way you can. Also, just your close physical proximity can help. Walk between the tables as you talk or teach. Just being near them might help a bit.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	Be assertive. Don't let them walk all over you. Don't be too strict either. Be a cool teacher.

I would then state that if conditions improved, then you would consider allowing them to choose their own seats once more. You need to be more assertive. If a student is talking, do not go on talking over them. Point them out and make it known that you do not approve of it. Take more drastic action with repeat offenders. Some sort of detention or demerit? Perhaps a deduction of points from assignments.|`|zofbEgtNaa	You must first learn to communicate.  If you are qualified to teach High School Chemistry, then your grammar skills should reflect that.  You must learn the language of your students.  Ninety per cent of what you will do in the classroom will be talking to your students.  Secondly, you must plan your lessons according to the length of your class.  If you are in the classroom for 90 minutes, then it is advisable to plan the class in, say, 15 minute segments.  Define clear, reasonable objectives for your self and your students.  You will probably be dealing with students of average intellect.  This means that without repetition and creative lesson planning, your technical subject matter will sail over the heads of 75 % of your students (if not more).  Observe a master teacher and note what s/he does to manage the classroom.  One other thing:  Students don't care how much you know until they know how much you care.|`|VZOisk2saa	i had a teacher come up to me once and say i dont care if you want to learn this or not but dont disrupted everyone else  i started behaving better after that
zIpbIWb3aa	It depends on who you ask. If you as a woman over the age of 50 or a feminist, they'll tell you that it's because women are independent, make their own money, have realized that marriage is slavery for women and need a man like a fish needs a bicycle. If you ask a woman my age or younger she'll have a completely different yet equally condescending reason. they'd probably say that men are immature, only want sex, are so afraid of commitment that they collapse to the floor sucking their thumb every time the word marriage is mentioned, or simply don't measure up.    If you were to ask a man he would probably tell you that the negatives outweigh the positive for a man to get married and after weighing his options decides to not get married. Those that do get married either delay marriage into their 30's, marry younger women or foreign women. This probably explains why the marriage rate for american women is dropping at a faster rate then american men.    There's no real reason for men to get married anymore. Most of the benefits that men use to enjoy are gone from marriage. The few benefits left are easy to find outside of marriage without signing a contract rewarding your spouse the the abandonment and betrayal of divorce. The family court system in itself is a very destructive institution from forcing child support for non-biological children to lack of enforcement of visitation to stripping men of custody of their babies 95% of the time to other atrocities. Men don't fear commitment, men fear divorce. With the family court system being clearly bias in the woman's favor there is nothing for her to loose but everything to gain in a divorce which explains why women file for 80% of the divorces in this country. Another reason why men don't want to get married is because of modern women themselves. When you consider what modern women expect from a man and what they're willing to do for a man, if you were to ask women "if you were a man would you want to be in a relationship with a woman like you?" 8 out of 10 would say no and out of the 2 that say yes 1 would be lying.|`|iHKJsyfTaa	2 reasons,  1) Fewer men are getting married  2) those that are , are putting it off as long as possible( mid-late 30's)|`|mCAWxobNaa	One reason is the high prevalence of lesbianism amongst modern Feminists who routinely attempt to encourage lesbianism as the only resonable sort of sexuality for young, unwitting women, hence they discourage marriage and heterosexual behaviour altogether and instead promoted lesbianism.|`|AA11530601	eh well from what I see most marriages end in divorce and apparently about 4/5 (which is the same as 8/10) married ppl admit to having cheated on their spouse when questionnaried anonymously.     But i think its social expectation - in the past, almost of our grandmothers would have been married by age 22, but now, as people have a little more say in their destiny now, they put it off until they are ready. Also, we date far many more ppl than we would have in the past and we have sex before marriage too which they didnt used to as much before contraception, perhaps the idea that we can still have fun dating before we can get married leads some ppl to be scared of commitment, as they want to have as much fun as they they can beforehand?|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Why bother?

Same goes for guys you know.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Because everyone says that marrying young is a mistake. I hear it all the time (I married at 19)    Because they are focusing on college and career and are putting off family for later. Personally I think that having kids when you're younger is the best way to do it. Women's fertility peaks in their 20s, and it is the healthiest time to bear children. The older you get, the harder it gets to conceive and the more risk is involved. And then you'll also have a harder time keeping up with little kids. But it's up to a woman to decide for herself when she wants a family.    Because everyone tells them that they should "have their fun" before settling down. That drives me nutz!!! I have 2 little kids and I'm only 24, and I have alot of fun in my life! Fun doesn't stop because you have children and a husband. They add to the fun. They *make* fun!    Because they have bad taste in men, perhaps, and keep winding up with jerks who use them and leave. Or maybe because the good men see them sleeping around and playing with the jerks, and they pass 'em over for the few girls who aren't carrying on like that.    Because they know that they don't want to marry or have kids, and they are happy being single. If a woman knows she doesn't want that, then it's good to stay single.    Maybe because they just haven't found Mr. Right yet. He can, after all, be hard to find sometimes.    There are lots of reasons, and not all of them are bad.|`|s3IBrhZCaa	good question. i have some theories about this......as i believe there are a few reasons.    1. my generation (and those after me) are considered the first generation not expected to do as well as their parents. yeah, lets face it......it's not looking pretty out there. long story short......guys are unable to "get with the program" these days.   unable to be the provider because they can barely provide for themselves.    2. many women get cheated on or dumped or whatever.....and they decide that since they can take care of themselves......what is the purpose for them to find a man to marry?    3. no other reasons. thanks for listening.|`|fQgbBx7caa	Usually after a couple gets married, the husband gets lazy in duties, especially with the kids.   If both works a 40 hour work week, its still up to the woman to take care of the kids, grocery shop, clean house, run kids to the Dr., do the laundry etc.  I think the girls are being more observant to this and just does not want the headaches, they have seen what their mom's, friends have been through and say NO WAY.  NOT ALL MEN but for the most part.  Also, not just into the late 20's its up into the 50's.....the reason for this one is if the man has kids, there usually is grand kids, she does not want the headache of being a convenient baby sitter....shopping for xmas, birthdays....having her home tore up.|`|gMvTpgVaaa	despite their reduced college enrollment, men are actually becoming smarter than in past generations|`|62ZBofvPaa	Marriage cuts into personal freedom, even your job if you decide to have kids...a lot of women don't really feel comfortable with that, the only women I know who married in their 20s are those who needed the money or those who wanted to have kids.

It has a lot to do with the individualist society we're heading into.

I haven't seen anything about it, but maybe I'm missing it.  Also, what do you consider "high"?    I believe culture has shifted and women (and men) are choosing to marry later.  IMHO this is because women are using their early 20's to educate themselves, get a career and learn who they are.       Women's motives for getting married have changed.  It is no longer a cultural necessity for a woman to get married.  It used to be that a woman's entire status and place in life was determined by the man she married.  Thus, women were in a hurry to get married.      Now, women can get married just because they want to, not because they need to.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	Because women are realizing that they don't need to be in a relationship to be happy.

fJy0vN7daa	Well I'm from and was raised as a child in Egypt.     Over there. We look up to a man who has a big family and wife etc. It's family first there. If you are a man and have a huge family there you get the best respect. No one looks down at you. Same for women.    If a man leaves his family and doesn't take care of them he is considered "unmanly" and gets no respect and gets snarls and "evil eyes".     If a women doesn't  put her family first she also receives no respect and snarls.     So basically If both men or women are selfish and only care about themselves they are not considered a "real" man or women. They receive no respect.     That's what I was raised to believe.|`|9bYEMrb9aa	Good question!  A Real man treat his woman with respect, never violence, provvides a safe environment for his children to grow up in.  A woman have here own carrire and contributes to the home in equal trems with her husband.She share the duties in the home with her husband.|`|Rd3nNYNNaa	According to our old culture, a man is the one who should work outside the house and he is the master of the house and women has to look after children,do the house work and look after children. She has to obey whatever her husband says.    Well now its not at all like that.Men cant over rule women.She'll fight back.She can go to work outside and men should also share the housework.     Girls and boys are also equally treated-equal schooling and education and career unlike olden times when girls had to opt out of school because their brothers needed money to learn. Also even a few years ago girls would only learn up to 10th and after that their marriage wild be decided.But now a girl cant be forced to marriage if she is not willing. She can choose any career and learn as much as she wants.|`|x5MYW2LPaa	Differences are only phsycial, peopel shouldn't conform to social gender roles, the spirit is neither male or female.|`|pDGVTLoFaa	A man is head of the house the provider and the women is the crux of the house an important member of the family as a "unit" the one who is there for the children's needs.|`|sfn6SpbCaa	I don't know where you come from  but where I come from a man is the male human-being and the woman is the female human-being. Social beliefs; not one is better than the other at all times. Behavior wise, well if the girls have to tow the line so do the boys. A girl can whack a baseball just as much as a guy can; it may not be as far, true, still, she can do the job.  I was pretty good at that game where you throw up the baseball and hit it with the bat. You know the one where everyone runs after the ball. Men and women are just as nervous as each other, both are capable of emotional pain and emotional joy. Both are quite creative and both thrive on encouragement. Well, that's all I got for now.  Don't be fooled by the name; I changed my name later on in life. I was, also, born in the states and raised in the states by my Prussian descent parents. Well, I say Prussian because my great grand parents only knew Prussian.   Anyways; enough on that.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	men have a penis   girls have a vagina  those body parts wont chance what the person is capible of  thats what i believe    i believe girls can be the 'bread winner' of a family  and men can cook and clean just as well as women|`|62ZBofvPaa	I think they are males and females respectively who have maturity and responsibility, what form that comes in varies from culture to culture and person to person.  A male or a female who is an adult but has no maturity or responsibility is nothing but a boy/girl.|`|AWQVbZcgaa	A man real writes to the senate, acts in the theatre, and enjoys a good glass of scotch. He must try to only spank his wife when she really needs it. A woman cooks dinner, stays in the kitchen, is a sperm bank for her man, and submits unconditionally. Also, men are allowed to have multiple wives while a woman may only have one husband.|`|OTT79NAtaa	A man is someone who achieves and usually produces more than he consumes. A woman is the exact opposite of that (generally) in that they usually spend or cost more than they contribute to society.|`|CGrOq1ibaa	okay seriously, whats with 'women' being used as a singular form.

mTVFb1u7aa	Canada would. No doubt about it. Canada has the upper edge in oil in the western hemisphere not only b/c of its abundance in the region, but also because of the numerous pipelines and efficient ways of distributing that oil. also, Canada is ahead of the game in alternative energy. especially wind energy. it leads the world, other than a few European countries in wind energy that will prove very profitable in the coming years. this combined with Canada's isolationist foreign policy will prove to serve them very well and have the fair better through the recession better than most countries. Australia included.|`|deTJcdv9aa	yes people will be more happier, and children will play outside with each other rather then paying alot of money to play violent video games.
J3k9WgzKaa	I would say brainstorms in the thing that brings out the most emotions in you. For me its the ocean, the rocks that extend into the water and a sunset.    After that creativity starts flowing.    Also when I was young I didn't have a girlfriend but I wanted to write love poems so I invented an imaginary girl that had a name and attitude and everything a real girl had.    Then I would imagine situations like going to the movies and buying her flowers, the way she laughed, giggled, everything.....then I would have so much inspiration I would come up with these beautiful poems.
OUbNSXjJaa	Mere analyzing will not do. After analyzing, what remedial steps are being taken by an individual is more important.    The rule for analyzing is, we should analyze and see whether our thinking, speaking or actions are in line with highly learned people or wise people. If yes, it is ok. If our thinking, speaking and actions are in line with inferior type of people, we should try to change or rectify towards better.|`|qBG8pp7laa	I'm kinda like that too, so I understand you. Maybe you wanna be a detective too someday.|`|Ltv37Azzaa	You probably have social anxiety disorder and you can either visit a psychologist or self medicate with alcohol/drugs.
LQUHzXTcaa	Just find what you love to do and you'll never have to work a single day. That is so important. In reality, we are students for life, so don't stop learning. I know how you feel. I myself don't conform to this society with this fake idealistic perception. But, you can't escape it. That is the downfall.     You are right on relationship. We all need to learn to be independent and think for ourselves--not depend on other people to hold our hand. But don't keep love out of your life. You need to feel loved at some point. There is nothing wrong with you. There is nothing wrong observing this world, because most people are afraid to question their society.     Only a handful of people think like you, and that is a good thing. Don't go see a therapist. They will only listen and won't give you any answers. Just trust yourself and you will know.|`|Sy7GhVDLaa	Did you honestly say there's more to life than relationships and love? What else is there? I think that's all there is to life. What's the point of anything if you don't have people you love with you?     (If you were talking about romantic love then ignore what I said. Of course you don't have to have a boyfriend or girlfriend or spouse to be happy. But you do need love and relationships with other people.)    As for your mom, tell her that you're 21 years old and she needs to give you space. She gave you life, but you're living it.
iZyLbv6aaa	Your body is actually, when it is falling asleep, becoming convinced that you're dying, so it tries to SHOCK you back to life, and when you are sleeping, you sometimes apply this to your dreams. Maybe?|`|HZ7Dlz3kaa	wow! very insightful! I never thought of that! I like it =o)
7xmr5R6qaa	Sorry for your loss, but some people cope differently to situations, I don't think he was being selfish just trying to spare you the pain of seeing him suffer also.|`|AA10788363	First of all sorry for your loss.  Greaving is a part of life.  It does suck.  Your friends should comfort you and talk to you but this does not always happen.  I lost a two of my close friends last week and they were both unexpected.  I had some friends there and some that were not.  Some people deal with death differently.  Me personally I wont go to to the death of a person who killed themselves. Its just a personal thing.  If this person is a male he might think your reasoning for your help is a different motive  ie; love or some way to get back with that person.  Some people just dont care.  Life is a beautiful thing and when somone is gone you realize that.  So may your loss be greeted with kindness and love.  Best wishes.|`|3p3otDlXaa	I'm sorry.  My grandma died a few years ago, and all I can say is: it took months before the feeling went away.  I felt like I had a black hole and weakened heart there.  Even at work, I cried in the back for some time.  I still dream of her.  She's almost always dying in my dreams too.  A father can be harder.  Yes.  My mom's father died at 51, when she was about 23.  You need many people to support you now.  I know.  I have people now that I can call 'grandma' but I'm not sure you can do that 'dad-wise.'  Hopefully, God will help you.|`|FIG58FVpaa	Sorry for your loss!    People deal with things in different ways and it's entirely possible that seeing you so upset and knowing what you're dealing with would have brought back bad feelings for your friend.    Maybe he was afraid that if he was upset and crying that he wouldn't be any help for you and might only make you feel worse. I don't know your situation more than what you wrote here, but I do doubt that he was being completely selfish and uncaring.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	I am really so sorry for you to have to go through such a hard day and to do this on your own..That must be very hard.. I can understand because if something happens to my parents.. I am 3000 miles away...     It may sound selfish when you first think about your best friends response.. but if you get over the horrible day you had today.. and think it over.. if he really knows that he would be no support to you at all because he would not be able to be ''a beacon of comfort for you on this day when you really need someone to lean on.. and he really can't give that.. then I believe it's not his fault.. he must have had a tough time grieving when he lost his family.. he believed he would be more in the way.. instead of helping you... I don't believe he is really uncaring and not selfish but emotionally not strong enough to be right now the rock you really need at this moment... Maybe it would have been better to have phoned your best female friend.. It doesn't make a difference that he is male and you female. it must have something to do with how he deals with grief...he probably can't handle it.. he could not handle the death of his parents and he knows he can't be supportive to others in such a situation.. that's the way he is.. we all have weaknesses and strenghts.. now you know his biggest weakness.. however, don't give up on him as a friend..He cares and he will check on you tomorrow... He is a friend and I would keep him.. he can't help the way he feels about grieving.. he is just not a kind of guy I would want to share a life with but as a friend.. yes, I accept my friends with their weaknesses and their strenghts.. because I know I have weaknesses also.. I would give you a hug right now and just sit there and let you talk to me even if I don't know you.. and I guess I would end up crying and not making it easier for you.. but maybe if he had come over and had cried on your shoulder.. you would have felt more that he cares.. even in his own weakness.. he could have come over.. even if he had cried.. maybe it's hard for some men.. to let their guard down.. he doesn't want to show his vulnerable side.. he doesn't want you to see him cry.. it's a lot easier for us females to show emotions...    You will be strong enough... I send you hugs... you are not alone... if you want to email me.. you know how to find me..     xxx|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I wouldn't say that it's normal, but what is normal when dealing with a death? Given the circumstances, an hour or two on the phone with you to talk was as good as a visit, in my opinion. You should treasure that friendship, regardless.    I'm sorry to hear about your loss.|`|axOPrPnBaa	he probably just doesnt like seeing people cry lots of people are like that,and maybe he doesnt want you to see him cry about his parents.

If so, I'd let her loosen my lugnuts|`|mCAWxobNaa	In all honesty I would because I really am not very good with relatively minor car problems and my good friend PW (may he rest in peace) is no longer with us, so I would love to find a girl who was good with auto repair, and I would work hard to try to date her for this reason.
mU2eMSi3aa	The snakes in your dream seem to represent life, rejuvenation.  It might seem odd but the snakes under your skin are represent healing, rebirth and renewal that reassures you after popping the zit.  Our skin represents the persona or facade we create for others so in this dream the side of you that you show to others might be in need of renewal.  When you are looking in the mirror you are trying to come to terms with the way you express yourself, you are concerned with your self-image.  You are worried about what others think of you and you need self-examination in order to function correctly.  Snakes coming out of your eyes is a new vision or new way of seeing yourself or the world.  It symbolizes renewed wisdom or enlightenment.    Edit: I just looked up the color of snakes and they say the same thing; black is potential, blue is the prime healing color and white is innocence, spiritual purity and wisdom.|`|GXVanwgPaa	i think ur embarrassed of something. but i had the same dream (2nd 1) only they were fish eggs like on sushi.|`|iSmIA9MZaa	well i dont know wat to say bout yur dream but sometimes when you pop a zit, the ooze comes out stringy and when it comes out it sorta curls up but its just ooze|`|AA10148136	you worry a lot about your looks  you need to be more confident in yourself and better self esteem  got a health problem  this can be taken care of with some work  keep your chin up  you will do alright in life  respect yourself|`|T5UY0Uqlaa	1)   Snake   To see a snake or be bitten by one in your dream, signifies hidden fears and worries that are threatening you. Your dream may be alerting you to something in your waking life that you are not aware of or that has not yet surfaced. Alternatively, the snake may be seen as phallic and thus symbolize temptation, dangerous and forbidden sexuality. If you are afraid of the snake, then it signifies your fears of sex, intimacy or commitment. The snake may also refer to a person around you who is callous, ruthless, and can't be trusted. As a positive symbol, snakes represent healing, transformation, knowledge and wisdom. It is indicative of self-renewal and positive changes.?     To see the skin of a snake in your dream, represents protection from illnesses.     2)Pimples   To dream that you have pimples, relates to issues about your self-esteem and self-image. You are feeling awkward or out of place in some situation or relationship.     To dream that you are popping your pimples, indicates that negative emotions about need to be expressed and acknowledge. Those emotions that you are holding back are on the verge of erupting.

WlLcttM2aa	I think it goes along with the quote "the time you enjoyed wasting was not wasted time" or something like that. It means, if you're sitting around doing nothing and "wasting time" but you're actually thinking or daydreaming or SOMETHING and you're enjoying it, then it wasn't really wasted. You weren't doing nothing, you were doing something. To me, "wasted time" is time when you are doing nothing and should be doing something.|`|AA11658197	your life doesn't need to have every moment focused on reaching a goal to be happy|`|3d61ffe88f7ee51153a052ce1dc0ee7daa	it means, say, you hang out at the lake one lazy summer day with a good friend, you two dont do much at all the whole day, you just lay there and talk, it was a waste,but you had a great day didnt you? :) thats the best way to waste time ^^ i mean, would you rather be working in a dead end job,or at the lake with your friend? in the end...it wasn't a waste at all ^^
AA12020853	Most people talk about what they are interested in. Just think about what you're interested in and ask the  other person if s/he is interested in it and there you go. If s/he says no, then ask what they areinterestedd in. If yes, then you have the beginnings of a conversation.  Always try to think about what you have in common. If you're at school, talk about school work, if you're at a restaurant talk about food etc. You can always mention music its a a good topic because everyone likes music.|`|1i5hDFE6aa	this is complex stuff...people can be hard to figure out; what they want, what they like..ect. if you have a hobbie you should branch out from there...take classes in that subject that have the same interests as you, they will tend to make you feel more comfortable. what it really takes is just finding people that like you for you. if your with people you have to put an act on for them to like you, it gets old.

7a00982533df23b16bd49972811d5b7faa	Depends on which category you fall into.     Teens are unsure of life in a way. They tend to question which direction they are going in, what to wear, what to do with school and friends....these are all stresses but on a different level.     Adults tend to be more sure of themselves as far as who they are and what direction they want to go...but have unavoidable things like house payments, jobs, car insurance, health issues, and other things like this on their minds.     So both are really stressed...just in different ways.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	Both, in their own way.  Teens can become stressed with school, love, work etc. The exact same things as adults. I think they are pretty much equal.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	No matter what the age group, you feel stressed because your experiencing it.

The have kids, bills, insurance, parents, work, etc. Most teens deal with some stress, but it's not the kind of stress that adulthood brings. If you can't get a zit off your face, it's not going to ruin your life. If you don't pay your bills, it can ruin your life. Plain and simple.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	I think its both because the adults have to worry about bills and providing for the family.  The teens but it all depends on how much their parents pressure them to do good in school.  Teens also have to stress over peer pressure and having good friends to hang out with.  If they are teased, then they have the added pressure of not having friends to talk too.|`|j7l9gavRaa	most likely teens because of the hormonal imbalances and growth they are going through. Adults don't typically deal with so much change so quickly.

teN7hu6Eaa	Here are some:  -Smile and say thank you, good morning, good evening, etc. Even if it's a bus driver or train operator or a secretary or waitress it makes a difference.  -Here are two commercials with some examples:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMwoexR1e...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07HJOavuc...  -If it's to the same person, just smile, stay friendly, if you see they help then help them, hold the door for them, that kind of stuff.  Just don't turn being kind into kissing their behind, that will only create problems.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I read a poem in a doctors office that said "say something nice to three people today"  I liked that, so when I go out in public, I look for three peolple to say something kind to.  You could also pay for someone's food at a cafe.  I use to pick flowers from my gardens and put them in vaces and leave them on my neighbors door step.  She had medical issues and couldn't garden.  I also used to take veggies from my garden and leave them on my neighbors door steps, and sometimes I found tomatoes on my back deck too.  You could walk your neighbors dog.  My mom had some neighbor girls and their mom wouldn't let them have a dog, so they would take my moms dog for a walk every day when they got home from school.  My mom used to bake cookies for the kids in the neighborhood and they would get done just as the kids would get home from school.  She would give them to the kids, and even if they needed an extra cookie for their "brother" that she knew they didn't have.  I used to bake cookies for my troops when I was in the military, and for my vet.  That is a good idea, take a basket of goodies to your vets.  My old vet used to trade services so I would bake for her.  I guess sometimes it was hard to be a vet and she just needed a treat.  (If you make rice krispie treats use real marshmallows or they won't come out)  Some people bake a plate of goodies and leave them in a hospital ICU waiting area.  Go to a nursing home and visit someone who doesn't have many visitors.  Or visit someone from your church that doesn't have family near by.  Smile, that is an easy one.  My husband use to work with a woman at school that would tell the children they were good.  I know that sounds silly to say "you are a good boy, or a good girl" , but I bet that is the only kind thing some of those kids ever heard.  She would compliment them on an outfit they were wearing or tell them they looked pretty, (or handsome)  those kids just never heard anyone say something nice or kind, it really made a difference for them.|`|CvBJ3RKPaa	That's a good idea, but don't look for strangers to whom you can be kind.   Charity begins at home. Start with your family or the people around you.  Help them do chores, or take responsibility for your own care -- things they usually do for you.  Today I did four loads of laundry while my wife was out running errands.  That made her day a little easier.|`|BpD01lccaa	I don't know I guess I could help people out.|`|BYF3NfxLaa	Hmm.

Well, I really like the surfer look, all natural.... but that is not to say that I would not be attracted to someone who had the gangster look, as for the pretty boy look, that is one thing I cannot stand, is a guy who looks "pretty" !

I like a look that is clean, but isn't the type that looks overly concerned with his own image--if you sit there with all name brands and looking like you're trying to prove something--it makes you look  like a tool.  If you sit there casual but clean, no matter what style--it looks good.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I don't have a particular "look" I just judge each guy individually. Sometimes there are guys who have the gangster look or surfer look or whatever that I go for but not all guys like that. Especially if they try too hard to be a certain "type" that's just silly. Most guys I see don't fall into a category and some are hot some not, just wear whatever you are comfortable with    Harriet|`|Dimi8By2aa	Gangster looks silly on anyone, in my opinion.|`|wRLidVqkaa	If you are concerned more about style than substance I'd say do whatever you want; but in turn you'll also only attract people who are into their style and looks rather than substance and personality.

What I mean is I like to see someone who has a sense of good hygiene and keeps himself and his clothes clean.  By well-fitting, I mean wearing clothes that actually fit his body, not 10 times too big or tight-fitting to the point of practically being painted on.|`|AA11530601	surfer look is hot, the gangster look is kind of old and u risk being seen as unoriginal or even worse a wannabe,(trying to be something ur not) or "plastic gangster". Plus, the only guys who can pull it off *sorry* are about 6ft and built like a tank.   Its cause the gangster look is associated with being arrogant and making visible attention seeking claims to masculinity, and so ppl are harder on them unless they actually look as if they can back up their image with experience. hence why only the 6ft ones get taken seriously.

uNRMU9fyaa	Hypnosis is only a state of mind. It will work only if the person you are hypnotizing is "hypnotizable" ("hypnotizable" people tend to be types who are more inclined to really get into a book or movie, and fantasize a lot). So depending on whether or not the people you can or can't be easily hypnotized the results will vary. Oftentimes, you can get hypnotized people to do things they normally wouldn't do, but then again, an un-hypnotized person can do the same based upon their willpower. Look it up in psychology textbooks if you don't believe me, but it's true.

You have said so much, but at the same time nothing. Generalities are for those fearful to commit knowledge.|`|MzmDqZ26aa	Money isn't the problem. Money is just a tool.    The US, despite facing economic decline, is still miles above China, India, and Indonesia in terms of poverty. The standard of living is higher, so I don't understand what your question is asking.

m85emlXyaa	I'm pretty sure you don't have anything. I've experienced this before and was wrongly diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The real problem is too much caffeine and too little sleep. Your mood swings are resulted in not enough sleep, so is your concentration problem. Too much caffeine causes you to be too tense, tired, loss of concentration, stressed out, and changes the way you respond to people.    Here is what I suggest: Get off the caffeine for a week. Drink water and hydrating drinks. If you need a little energy drink some green tea. Take a walk in the afternoon so that you are tired at night. You'll get much better sleep if you get a little exercise during the day. Plus, exercise will help with your mood swings (I promise). Go visit a therapist at least once a week. It's good for everyone.    I hope this helps.
5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -  Oh love, I have two girls who are all grown up now.  The first one was skinny, had the ability to study on her own and made good grades.  She is now 23 and still doing the same.  She has few friends because she is not boy crazy, she wants a career more than anything else.  My other daughter was not just chubby, she become almost 70 lbs over weight.  She was fun loving...but had a lot of feelings like you, always looking for acceptance.  What she finally learned is to be who she was and if people didn't like her...they were missing out.  When she became a high school senior (up until then she was over weight) she began to grow...and she began to walk...and she began to not care what people thought...and she began to lose the weight.  We used to walk together a lot.  Now she is in the army walking 9 miles with a pack on her back.  You don't know what the future holds for you but I can tell you this: Do not live for the approval of others because there is always going to be someone who will disapprove of something.  An example is this site:  Many people on it are kind and compassionate to peoples feelings and needs, then there are others because they feel low will go through and give every answer a thumbs down, no matter how good it is.  Just be who you are...regardless of whether you look picture perfect (no one does anyway).  We project to others how we feel about ourselves and if we aren't careful we convince them of who we think we are.  I was popular in school with everyone.  I didn't care what color, how smart you were, if you had money or had none...I cared about WHO you were, WHAT your character was.  I was back home for a funeral and a girl who was a lot bigger than me came running down the street.  Actually I thought I was toast.  When she got to me she threw her arms open and lifted me off the ground, and said "It really is you" with a big grin.  She said that I was the only one of the popular kids who ever spoke to her.  Eventually I smiled and said "Hi" to her everyday of our 4 years in high school.  To this day I cannot remember doing that...but she is now a successful business woman making lots of money, has a wonderful husband & she is loving life!  Just wake up every day and don't think about yourself.  Think about doing at least 5 out of the ordinary things for someone else.  Like smiling at someone who is down, helping someone pick up the pile of books they dropped, saying thank you to the person that serves you lunch.  Think about your character...because in life love...that's the only thing that doesn't change.  I think you are a good person...you should too.|`|5EFHyGVbaa	I recommend you check out this social networking community called LetsReflect.com. There are people there going through situations similar to yours. They are great for advice and encouragement.

You are capable of great things! I believe in you. Best of luck.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	Skinny girls are just as unsure of themselves as chubby girls.  Everyone has insecurities.  Some of these girls that you wish you could be like are wishing they could be like you.      As far as what people may think of you, most are too busy thinking about themselves to even notice another person.  Of those that do notice you, at least half admire you.  It's rare to notice someone who doesn't impress you in some way.|`|cCxK6MKQaa	Gilbe, hey man don't let you're weight do that to you. You should talk to someone at you're school and they can get you help with you're weight. Also try and watch what you eat, stay away from breaded or fried foods and try a healthy choice like fruit or yogurt for snacks instead of chips or pastry etc. Here is a website that may help you and you can talk to a doctor who will help you out, just click email the wiz and write them the same message you wrote here.     http://www.blubberbuster.com/teens.htm       Good luck bud and if you need to talk to someone send me an email, i will be glad to try and help|`|Ed8BbSzeaa	better to be a little chubby than skinny|`|KT8RatG1aa	No you are not messed up. It would be a comfort to you to build your self esteem. When you go out into the public hold your back straight, shoulders straight and your chin just a tad high and open your mouth and show your teeth. It will make you look like you are smiling even though you know you are not. You have to force yourself to do this. This gives others the opinion that you feel just right about yourself.  When you get up in the morning look in the mirror and say: I "AM" a nice person. Keep saying it, because you really are a nice person. It would be good to specialize in something at school  and be really good at it or maybe there is a club you could join. Many people are chubby, just look around you. When you go out shove  those thoughts   aside about what you think people are thinking of you. Maybe they are not.  Practice with the mirror as much as you can. You can build yourself up.  Try this for awhile and if your thoughts get worse about suicide try talking with your school counselor or someone you trust.  Being chubby is not a valid reason to commit suicide. Work on yourself every morning-you can do this. Hold your self up with pride when you go out.Force yourself and each time it will be easier.
9XAf7jxaaa	You are not selfish, but I think your ego and such was fed by feeling needed by and important to your sister.  And you feel very much alone and maybe as if you do not matter now.  Obviously a touch of jealousy.  Remember that in her heart, family comes first.  After being your sister for all these years, no one can replace you.  Remember that it is unconditional love which she feels towards you and that her boyfriend has a less developed relationship with her.  They are getting more acquainted and affectionate.  No need for jealousy because you are not forgotten.  I advise that you pick up a hobby and get some assurance of your own and that you hang with some friends yourself.  Why is she the only one allowed to be happy?  Be happy for her happiness, and return yourself the favor and be happy.  Maybe get a boyfriend of your own.  Try talking with your sister more often, and see if you can be more friendly with her boyfriend.  Certainly give them their space, but you could get to know and like her boyfriend and potentially share their happiness with them.  Don't write him off for jealousy.  I think you should appreciate your sister's happiness a little more and find some of your own.  Happy people you love should make you happy, not sad.  Look at the brighter aspects of this!  Good luck.|`|LQUHzXTcaa	No, you just miss hanging with your sister. Now that her attention is focused on this one guy, you feel the way you are now. You aren't angry because she is happy--you are angry because your sister is spending more time with her boyfriend.
mU2eMSi3aa	This dog represents someone or something you can't shake off and who might make trouble.  He might be the guardian of your subconscious mind.  The basement represents the subconscious and things you may have suppressed.  You may not have come to terms with your sexual desires and prefer to keep it hidden.  Since you were interrupted while making out it sounds like you may have inhibitions of which you are not consciously aware.  The rocket would represent the male sexuality and by what you said about the brother you are recognizing that it's not functioning the way it should.  Hope this helps some, good luck and God bless.

R6IYY4miaa	There are lots of different psychologist types the way there are lots of types of scientists. Developmental psychologist specialize in the way people develop. They may study how children learn for example. Clinical psychologists are your therapists. They work with clients with mental illnesses and emotional issues. Cognitive psychologists study how people perceive and process information. Behavioral psychologists study behavior, some in humans, some in animals. Sports psychologists work with athletes to enhance their performance. Psychologists are everywhere- in labs, in classrooms, in offices, in hospitals, in schools. There are about 80 different types of psychologists and then those psychologists have specialties. I know of someone who is a psychologist who designs chairs for businesses so their employees produce the most amount of work without being too comfortable and falling asleep. If you're interested more in psychology you should check out the APA (American Psychological Assoc.) website.|`|KT8RatG1aa	A psychologist helps you solve your personal problems.

They are not scientific and have never cured a single one.  Avoid them like the plague and do not get near a psychiatrist.  These people think they are God and are power drunk with coercive treatment.  There is ungodly money involved.
Yx1kEsCHaa	Well, people keep on saying that China is great the media only says that because they want to push their Communist Propaganda but I don't see the Communist Chinese Government existing in next century or by the end of this one.    But, India is a force to be reckoned with for now. If the leaders of India can distribute the wealth properly India could become the United States and the United States could become the next England.    The status of the United States will also be determined by the leaders we have. I am not a Conservative but I think that we need another Ronald Reagan type leader to make America emerge or keep our place as the world's only Superpower. Obama won't do that.|`|n0iLfXrOaa	usa is richer than india but china has much more power and money than the usa|`|0wZcKn8Zaa	In America even the jobless and homeless have cell phones.

Go ahead and propagate your ideas of "better than US", maybe you should try to raise awareness on poverty eradication. There are more than 30 crores of people below the poverty line. We have enough food grains in our country to feed American people and your people. we can still build our way back to the mother earth even bigger stronger and "Cleaner". Cleanliness is next to Godliness. Let India think before they spit or throw garbage. Literally saying India is decomposed now with all the dump yards everywhere. Can we still manage to go around covering our noses with kerchiefs?

AA10894849	I finished my doctorate at an Argosy campus. The school has its pluses and minuses.   Pluses: My program was APA accredited, but not all are. You want to make sure that the campus and program are accredited. I found the classes to be very challenging and the school has higher requirements than some schools. Some of my colleagues who have attended state universities were required to complete less externship hours and also did not have the same classes. When speaking to my supervisor, she never had classes in supervision, consultation or social psychology. I did. My campus also had an excellent faculty. My dissertation was co-chaired by an internationally renowned researcher and author. A lot of the faculty has worked for major government health organizations or been committee members (or presidents) of the ACA, APA, or state psychological associations. Some of the faculty are very respected in the field and have presented internationally. I also have not had any problems finding work with my degree.   The downside is the reputation. Because they are a professional school that is run by a corporation, they do advertise excessively. So, people often assume they are an online school (they are not). They also admit a lot more students than other schools. Some schools may admit 3-10 students per year. My campus may admit 50. So, Argosy has the reputation of flooding the field.

There aren't many redheads in the world, especially men (since they dye their hair less). I think red hair is a unique and quirky trait and it can be very attractive on the right person. I don't get this redhead/ginger prejudice people have. What's wrong with red hair? I have no hair color prejudices.    I have a couple of relatives with red hair, they stick out like a sore thumb in my family. I remember playing with my cousin when I was younger and wondering why his hair was such a bizarre shade of red. It was strange and curious to me. I think that's why redheads get teased/taunted a lot, because they're different.|`|h4R4Txjvaa	Seems like your mad?

BMxNOJ39aa	Can one study people and not be biased by one's own values?    "In man, man himself in the same species that studies him. He is a rational animal and his capable of studying himself, maybe by introspection. However, we ask: could he, by himself, establish the truth about himself without being biased in one way or another by this own way of thinking? Is there a way to escape this kind of dilemma and arrive to the objective truth about himself, which is outside of himself?"  http://amijares.wordpress.com/2008/11/05...
