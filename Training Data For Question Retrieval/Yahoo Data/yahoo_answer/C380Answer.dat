YyAUdSPeaa	One side of the patio is would guess attaches to your house and the other side is toward the dirt.  I am wondering where the rain water runs to.  So will guess that it is not attached to your house and say that you could put up a boarder of some kind like a retaining wall by using bricks and mortar them to the edge of your patio concrete.  Or you can plant some good thick grass in that area that the water will go through but not the mud.  Another thing you can do is overlay the patio with some nice pavers as this can be done by anybody and if you lay them out right they don't have to be cut.  You may have to glue the outside pavers down so they don't move but the rest of them will sit in place without glue.    Another thing you can do is install a plastic 4"X6" trench drain if you have a place for the water to run to.    I am just wondering about the water running toward your house.  Some how this must be fixed or ti could cause problems with your house.     May if I had more info on what it looks like I can give you more ideas.|`|b44dc153fd5ba224cc405a4c25fa40e9aa	dig a trench around the edge of the patio about 12 inches wide and 12 inches deep and below the level of the patio fill trench with 1 inch rock  to about 10 inches then put sod on it or just fill all the way with rock. the rock will give the water a place to go so it will then soak into the ground.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	Try to determine the lowest point on the outer edge[s] of the patio. Hopefully, you have some lower elevation yard within a few feet of that point.      IF so, then simply dig a shallow trench [one shovel width wide] from the low edge point to an area of the yard which is one to two inches lower than the patio edge.  This does not represent "a lot of dirt."    This will allow the patio to drain during rain [or when you hose it down] and thus reduce the mud accumulation.

TMB4d3FAaa	Growing herbs in pots in pots is a great way to enjoy them year round. For the same price as a single plant you can buy a whole bag of seeds. When your present plant dies just plant another seed and in a couple of weeks your back in business.  In our herb club each member buys a package of seed and grows enough for everyone.  We exchange plants and everyone gets an opportunity to have as many different varieties as we have members.  The herb seeds will stay plant-able for up to 10 years.   Most herbs are pretty tolerant of drier soil.  However, container gardening requires  more frequent watering. The pots tend to wick off the moisture. I purchased a moisture meter to keep track of my plants when I first started growing in pots.  You may need to water at least once every day.  Make sure your soil lets the water flow out rather quickly.  Standing water will quickly kill most herbs. I did see an excellent product while I was visiting in the UK called hypertufa..  Its a pot made from cement, sand and moss or other available light weight materials. Although it wicks moisture into the air it holds a lot of moisture from watering and greatly increases the chance succes by absorbing a great deal of excess moisture when it is watered.  Most herbs enjoy lots of sun.  Some will appreciate some respite from the sun on hot days. moisture will be the thing you will need to monitor the most to keep your herbs healthy.  Most herbs came from soils that were considered less than ideal.  They can tolerate some pretty miserable conditions.  Don't overwater, watch for them to show signs of drooping leaves etc then water fully.  Some herbs will last for years. Most will die after they flower and set seed.  One way to extend their time is to cut off the flowers.  The plant will continue to try and set seeds;   But, then again, they are easy to grow from seed.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Soil....John Innes No 1  Most herbs are from the Mediterranean and love sunshine and free draining soil.  However Basil/Parsley and coriander like more moisture and prefer some shade  If your not using some of the herbs often,then prick out the tips with scissors to keep the herb busy and it will not run to seed.  When using herbs the new leaves give more flavour.  Buy as small plants,buy more than one if using a lot.  With basil or parsley,buy in a supermarket,and then CAREFULLY split the herb apart so one plant will give 5/6 mini herbs.It soon recovers and you get a lot of herb for from one plant|`|DIxbib1paa	Bay tree, chives, mint, these i know can grow well outside, as for soil, I recon just regular compost will be fine.|`|HWtG9dkzaa	By them as small plants from the garden centre - as this way, when winter rolls in - you can move them in doors.

Basil is a great one as is chives, mint and thyme but there are so many varieties of each that you'd be best deciding what flavour you will use most.  Never buy your herbs from the supermarket as these are mass produced so they grow fast but die quickly. Most garden centres will sell them in 1L pots which are ideal to start with! Also don't be afriad to mix different herbs in one pot, they will look and smell great!!|`|x86mC8yyaa	Agree with all the suggestions about what to plant - just to say that I've found Levington Peat-free Compost with added John Innes is very good for all plantings in pots, and especially for plants that need free drainage. It has a really nice texture to handle and doesn't seem to go green round the top of the pot like ordinary multipurpose compost does. Most herbs are drought-tolerant, but on the other hand if you are growing them for eating, you don't want the stems to become too dry and woody, you want nice lush shoots, so they do need regular watering (in pots with good drainage and suitable compost) and if you have problems doing this and the pots dry out very quickly, maybe the addition of some water-retaining granules to the compost mght help.|`|Ju4FuM2saa	I am in the UK.     Right at the moment I have two types of parsley (curled leaf and flat leaf), two types of mint and chives all growing in separate pots outside the kitchen door.  I am growing my Rosemary in the flower border as it tends to get very large and the pretty blue flower does not look out of place there..    I use ordinary compost and buy plants from the supermarkets or garden centres.  I do not grow from seed as the packet of seed can cost more than one plant.    The secret is keeping the pots right outside the kitchen door - easy for both picking and watering.    Best of luck.

xE8orz6Daa	Homework question eh?    Well not many people realise that nutrients is a more eco friendly word for "chemicals".    Normally chemicals such as nitrates, phosphates etc are just added as either solid form, or as in a solution and dumped on soil.    You've seen the tractors and aeroplanes spraying what looks like water over fields....well that's what "nutrients" are.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	it can be added in a few different ways-    first-- by adding manure with spreader wagons- that will "broad-cast" the manure over the fields and it contains a lot of nutrients- and when the farmer plows the soil to plant, it's worked into the soil.     second-- as some plants grow, they put different nutrients in the soil and they take different nutrients    third-- crop rotation- here's an example: cotton uses a certain nutrient and if you plant it year after year, the nutrients will be depleted, but if you use crop rotation- where one year you plant cotton and the next you plant soybeans or peanuts, the soybeans or peanuts will put back what the cotton took. cotton uses what the soybeans or peanuts put in the soil and soybeans or peanuts use what cotton puts in the soil  there are many different crops that can be rotated like that      Zombie Munch--   nitrates, phosphates, etc.. are not only added to the soil by the use of granular or liquid fertilizers. its more expensive to do it that way especially if a farmer isn't using crop rotation that much or if the soil was lacking in the first place   "You've seen the tractors and aeroplanes spraying what looks like water over fields....well that's what "nutrients" are."   - those are crop dusters, and SOMETIMES the pilot or farmer is spraying things like that, but MAJORITY of the time, they are spraying herbicides or pesticides or like with cotton- a defoliator|`|944iJNAdaa	Nutrients are either spread on the surface, rototilled into the soil, or injected (anhydrous ammonia).|`|b30ebd51a705432ff85d083b2d05aea7aa	When the fields are fallow ie between crops. Organic matter is usually tilled into the soil then. Nutrients,depending upon the crop itself, are then added...and added again. Rotation cropping should be used even more stringently when you talk about 'intensive farming'...to avoid excessive pests and diseases,which then defeats your purpose. (I guess you could ask Cole's or Woolworth's or McDonald's for that matter).

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	Check out Consumer Report for the answer.  Either their magazine or website.    They never accept any paid advertisement so their opinion is independent.  They also will survey their readers to learn about the repair history of the items.    Sometimes I do not buy what they recommend or their "Best Buy", but at least after reading their articles - I know which makes / models to avoid (bad features, lack of features, noise, repair history, etc).  I may not buy the models they recommend because I do not want their features or I do not want to pay their cost.    Sometimes you can get better items for less money.    Another thing, make sure they are Energy Star (a little blue star will be on the label) compliant.  This means they are judged by the manufacturer and the federal government to use less energy.  Based upon the estimated life of the appliance, sometimes you can spend more money to buy something that has lower operating costs.

Place one paper bag underneath the cloth while you set the iron to heat on a medium to medium high level, depending on the fabric. . Place a second paper bag on top of the wax.

You can buy it at grocery stores, Wal-Mart, Target, etc. in the cleaning products aisle.  Just pour enough Goo Gone on the wax, let is sit for a minute then rub your little heart out.  It'll take some elbow grease, but it will clean it up.      You may need to use your regular bathroom cleaner once all the wax is gone to get your original ceramic shine back, but Goo Gone won't discolor or scratch your ceramic surface.  And, you don't have to worry about burning yourself if you try to heat the wax to remove it.  That is an option, but in tight spaces or unusual surfaces it can be difficult to heat and try to absorb the wax with paper towels.  An iron and paper towels works great to remove wax from most carpeting/rugs, but with a ceramic surface I wouldn't risk it.    I've used Goo Gone to remove wax from glass table tops, mirrored surfaces and tile and have great success.  And, Goo Gone works great in many other household situations.  It's not very expensive and it works!

zRbYyh7haa	Although cassiopes can be grown from seed most commercial propagation is done from softwood cuttings taken in August or September. Mounding soil over some the bases of some of the shoots may result in layers which can be removed.    There are three keys to successful culture of Cassiope lycopodioides . The easiest to provide is an appropriate soil: at least one third peat, one third lime free sand, and at most one third loam. That should be sufficiently acid. The next easiest key is reasonably constant moisture. The hardest to provide is a cool, but light exposure. Cassiope lycopodioides should be planted on a north facing slope with a rock on its south side blocking midday sun.    Good luck :-)

Many natural and synthetic polymers are attacked by ultra-violet radiation and products made using these materials may crack or disintegrate (this is, there are not UV-stable). The problem is known as UV degradation, and is a common problem in products exposed to sunlight. Continuous is a more serious problem than intermittent exposure, since attack is dependent on the extent and degree of exposure.    Many pigments and dyes can also be affected, when the problem is know as phototendering in textiles such as curtains or drapes.    UV light stabilizers are used frequently in plastics, including cosmetics and films. The primary function is to protect the substance from the long-term degradation effects from light, most frequently ultraviolet light. Different UV stabilizers are utilized depending upon the substrate, intended functional life, and sensitivity to UV degradation, .    UV stabilizers, such as Benzophenones, work by absorbing the UV radiation and preventing the formation of free radicals. Depending upon substitution, the pattern of the UV absorption is changed to match the application. Concentrations normally range from 0.05% to 2%, with some applications up to 5%.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	Here is a recipe using water,bleach,baking soda and borax:  http://www.diynetwork.com/diy/lv_househo...|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Sounds like the sun has bleached it - sometimes when something white is left in direct sunlight for long lengths of time - the colour becomes bleached.

gFHTcIc8aa	Nearly anytime.  Right now is the best time for preparing soil for sod in warmer (subtropical) areas.    You can often lay sod over existing grass.  Make sure base soil is very damp and get rid off as many weeds, swails and other debris as possible. Ideally, you want to lay sod over a flat, even, wet surface.  You should have a good 4"  base of topsoil, but I've had success with less.    INSURE YOU HAVE EITHER AN IRRIGATION SYSTEM OR A RELIABLE MEANS OF WATERING SOD DAILY FROM THE DAY OF INSTALLATION, THROUGH HOT MONTHS, UNTIL MID-OCTOBER.    The first year of sod is most critical.     Best time to plant warm season grass sod is when temeratures are rising in early-mid spring. Warm season grass roots are most active in warm soils (60+ deg.) and can survive long, hot spells very well if maintained properly.  They will, however, go dormant (turning lt. brown) during prolonged cold spells.    Since you're in the subtropical zone, you want to plant a warm season grass.   Bahia & Bermudagrass are durable, warm season grasses.  Bahia has higher insect and disease resistance than Bermuda.   But Bermuda is somewhat cheaper and easier to maintain.  Bermuda is a very good 'creeper' grass as it has a long, tough root system which will spread rapidly compared to other grasses.  St. Augustine Grass will also work, but certain cultivars can be somewhat susceptible to fungus and pests.|`|mP0LLMVjaa	The weather has been so good here that yes you can start planting sod. Just be sure to keep it watered since we haven't been getting any rain. Also try to stay away from St. Augustine grass. It requires too much water and it's getting too hot in the summers here for it. I would go with bermuda or zoysia.|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Yes, you can plant sod now. It will be growing very slowly until the soil temperatures warm up into the 65 to 70 degree range. You have several options in SA. Bermudagrass, St. Augustine, Buffalograss, it's just a matter of preference. Check with your local nursery to see what's available. Look at lawns in the area and decide which grass you want. Lay the sod and keep it watered until the lawn is established.

The large pipe would be a chimney.    A chimney is a structure for venting hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect. The space inside a chimney is called a flue. Chimneys may be found in buildings, steam locomotives and ships. In the US, the term smokestack (colloquially, stack) is also used when referring to locomotive chimneys. The term funnel is generally used for ships' chimneys and sometimes to refer to locomotive chimneys.[1][2].

8apA3Rffaa	Good choice as long as it isn t a polished porcelain w/ a high glaze.. These will show scratches..

Install it on top of 1/4" cement board that is screwed and thinset to 1/2" plywood. Make sure to use Versabond modified thinset for porcelain tiles when laying them. I also try to make the smallest grout line possible and use unsanded grout.

Also after a few months the grout will look filthy. Solid granite, formica or wood tops are better in my opinion.|`|36aPSk4oaa	I have tile countertops.  Don't do it.    Porcelain is great and extremely durable. But the problem is the grout.   It will become a maintenance nightmare.  Grout stains, discolors, chips and comes out.   Grout becomes a prime spot for mildew growth. You'll need to regrout every few years.    Grout can be sealed with a special liquid, however it needs to be applied with great precision onto the grout - being careful not to get it on the tiles.  Why?  Because when the sealer cures, it leaves a permanent residue.  Althought it's clear,  at certain angles you can definitely see a change in sheen of the tiles.    Still, even though it's sealed, the grout will eventually chip out due to all the scrubbing, cutting, pots and pans, and other heavy "traffic" that a bathroom floor never sees.    Look at Silestone.  The least expensive colors are about $49 s.f. at Home Depot. It's indestructible stuff.

AA12318686	Hi Amanda !  Try applying Kiltz over the red paint, it does a great job hiding the other color. Maybe use red as an accent color, esp. since the room is small and does not get much sunlight.    what are his hobbies or interests ? Does he collect anything?   Talk to someone at a do it yourself home improvement store. They will help you.  I like light blue like the sky, or light yellow like sunlight, for the walls for a boy's small bedroom and then decorate according to his interests... dinosaurs, camping, insects, cars, trucks or motorcycles, trains, firemen, policemen, wild animals, farm animals, pets.   Good luck to you and your family!|`|6uEmRe7Naa	I have red walls, it is probably the hardest color to cover up. I would invest in a really good primer, don't skimp out on this step. If you buy a quality primer then one coat should do it. If you have a Sherwin-Williams near you, go there! The paint is a little more expensive but it is worth it. It covers in one coat, and you will not be disappointed. Check out the web site...http://www.sherwin-williams.com/do_it_yo...  They have a color visualizer that's pretty awesome. I think it will help a lot in picking the right color. I would stay with a blue or green, the shade possibilities are endless. I would think I lighter dusty blue to a lighter moss green.    Hope this helps! Good Luck!|`|bhs05edAaa	Prime well and then maybe a light blue? Lighter blue walls are reminiscent of the sky so make a room feel bigger, and if your son likes being outside, cheerful. Good luck!|`|gg8rjgj9aa	Definitely "Kills" to cover the red.  Walmart's paint scored really well in a Consumer Reports issue, which surprised me!    I painted my young son's room a rich, warm yellow.  He has lots of navy blue and red accents, and it looks really warm and cheery without being girlish or babyish.    I've found that whenever a child has a favorite, extreme, color, it's best to use it for accent items.  Much easier to change, that way!|`|ehNPtBVYaa	what about americana theme, leave one wall red and paint one blue, one white? or you could paint the flag to cover one wall?    some more ideas here might help  http://mariesmanordecorating.com/america...    http://boysthemebedrooms.com
09zVUMBRaa	I would choose stucco.  It looks better than vinyl and has potentially less maintenance.|`|pjGueC4xaa	Vinyl.  It requires no maintenance.  Stucco needs to be painted now and then.|`|WN3DdSGDaa	I do a lot of repairs on house for a living.  Vinyl is not happy with high winds if the crew that installs it cheep out on nails. I have fixed more than one house where the gas grill was to close to the siding....Color matches in the future are hard to do when fixing. Colors fade and can not be changed. Adding siding over old existing siding, I would never do. The only one who bennefits is the salesman. When you say stucco do you mean Real stucco or the fake stucco over foam board?  The fake stucco is a pain to fix once it has been damaged. When you break the surface to mount the Welcome sign by your door, check your paperwork to see if you voided your warranty.  Real stucco over concrete block lasts a long long time.  Real stucco over wood frame mean that you will never never know if there is damage behind it (water,rot, termites) until it is way to late and the repair costs are very high  Good luck.
4z0Rk4Ddaa	You do not have to be a licensed contractor especially if you know what you are doing. You can do a lot of the work yourself which will save you a lot of money.  Check with the city where you live to find out what there ordinances and codes are before you begin this way you will have some idea as to what you need to do.  Example:  Where I live if the wood is burnt less than 1/4 inch down a 2x4--we do not have to replace it.  Where you live you may have to replace it. You may have to get a permit.  They will probably have inspectors come in at various times to inspect the work that is done to make sure that the work is done to code. The city will work with you on this.  As for moving in I am sure you can move in as soon as it is live-able to live in.  Usually after plumbing, electrical, heating have passed inspection.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	In order to resell the house and maybe now, to rebuild you'd better check with the building inspectors office for any codes your going to have to follow.

Your best bet would be to contact the Building inspector to learn the requirements to re build. If the structural integrity of the building (framing) is not damaged more than char, you could do it. The rule here is that any wood framing that is charred more than 1/8', it must be replaced. The remaining framing that has smoke damage must be sealed to prevent the odor. Any wiring or plumbing exposed, must be brought up to the current building codes. Any work must be inspected before it can be recovered with drywall. Roof damage from fires makes that the first priority before new inside work can begin. It's a very dirty job, so wear face masks when working in the building.|`|AA11042231	i do insurance work like house fires and water damage you need to go to the building department for your permit first if you know how much the damage will cost to rebuild you will need that , first we do is empty the house of content then anything 1/4 inch char would get replaced then we clean all soot and stain kill oil base everything furnace gets clean and sealed with soot seal then you got paint and flooring to make sure the smell of smoke is gone we ozone the home all fires are cleaned and treated different due to the nature if you have any questions along the way you can e-mail me

Think of a dowel or rod fitting into a round hole. Except in mortise & Tenon, the hole is square or rectangular as is the piece that fits into it. The "Mortise" is the hole, and the Tenon is the rod or dowel.  The tenon is smaller than the piece of wood to which it is attached, for example, if you were cutting a tenon on a 2" x 4", the tenon might only be 1" x 2".  A tenon saw is used to cut the tenon out of the surrounding wood. It is usually a "back" saw, or a saw that has a ridgid or strong rib on the back to keep it from flexing, and is usually not overly long, around 12" to 16" long.

Call you county or municipality building department and make them aware of you neighbor changing the elevation of his property, especially since it is affecting the flow of water on or onto your property. Don't be shy about demanding the city or county to prove to you what his elevation requirements are. Remember, these governments work for YOU, not the other way around.    You will have to determine the depth but you can dig up around your garage and install drain tiles and then cover them up with gravel. That should keep the water flowing through the drain tiles and not into your garage. Lowe's or Home Depot should have the material you need. Explain to them what you want to do and they will be more detailed about the process for you. I hope that helps.|`|JrGGYdBDaa	talk to ur neighbour and ask him for advice/solution. check ground water level. you said the water came through the floor. otherwise get a drain built.|`|LH18jRW8aa	I noticed something you mentioned. "due to dog digging and he had a pool that had left sunken areas" This triggered something for me. With a properly installed and functional pool there is no reason for areas around the pool to have sunken areas. The sunken areas are caused by leaky pipes underground eroding the soil away. You need to have a soils engineer evaluate the condition, they can shoot the elevations around your garage and make sure your footings are not settling causing the water to be trapped in your garage. They can evaluate where the water is coming from.
QEEweJUaaa	The Ilex genus contains more than 780 evergreen and 30 deciduous species of trees and shrubs native to North and South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia.   Hollies are dioecious; male plants produce pollen, and female plants produce berries. A male plant must grow within 30 to 40 feet of a female for good fruit production.   There are hollies that will grow as far north as USDA Hardiness Zone 3 and as far south as Zone 11.   Most hollies prefer full sun and well-drained, slightly acidic soils. Some species will grow in shade but will produce less fruit.   Hollies are relatively pest-free, but some do suffer from winter die-back.   Propagate by seed, cuttings, layering, or grafting. Seeds can take several years to germinate. Take cuttings from deciduous species in early summer and evergreen species in late summer. Treat the cuttings with hormones and root under mist.|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	Where were they before you got them and where have you been keeping them?  If they have been inside then you will have to harden them off before you can leave them outside - but I suggest you don't start to do that until the weather starts to warm up a bit - April time probably.  You really need to keep them at more or less the same temperature as they have been kept since they were sown or potted on until you do that.  If they were outside all the time then make sure you don't take them inside & get them used to warmer conditions!

LH18jRW8aa	Many older Garage door openers (GDO) have a separate box that has the receiver in it, you will see a small wire running from the GDO to the box and a single wire hanging out of it. The wire is the antenna if you see this configuration but do not see the wire then it has possibly been removed or damaged.     If you have a newer GDO that has the receiver built in you might have a faulty receiver. You can order one from the manufacturer and install it yourself if you are fairly capable. Otherwise get a technician to do the repair.    You could also be seeing some effect from the building itself. I have had problems with remotes in parking structures that are concrete and steel. Usually even there the problem goes away at 20" or so.

Corian is a solid surface product that is virtually seamless. With that said, corian can be repaired should you scratch it deeply (impossibly) melt or ruin it in any way. Corian can be plugged, epoxy'd and buffed to where you only see the repair on the under side of the top. The small particulates you see in it allow this to happen nearly seamlessly. Corian can also be produced to look polished like stone, this is only good if you rarely use your kitchen. The polish will dull over time. There is no sealing with this product unlike granite or real stone surfaces. Corian Does NOT stain. It's impossible to penetrate it to do so unless you have scratched it and still it will not. Should if for any unknown reason to me or it's distributors they will replace it. Corian is  a Dupont product. I still prefer cambria quartz, but it's far more expensive, and about double that the cost of corian, which runs about 45-60 per sq. foot.

Each gallon should cover between 300-400 sq'.    To get the best finished look spend alittle extra time and prep all walls.  Start with removing all nails, patch those holes. Look for all dents and small holes, patch those. I use lightweight patch. Comes in small yogurt size containers. Can be found anywhere.  Allow that to dry, a couple of hours usually. Lightly sand the repairs then lightly sand all walls. I use a long pole sander with a 3x8" sheet of sandpaper on the end. You can also fine this tool anywhere and it is inexpensive and does a great job. Use fine sandpaper.    Next, to get a perfect finish, prime the walls with a good primer. I use Kilz2, about $15 per gallon.    Allow the primer to dry a couple of hours. Start painting.    Start by cutting the edges, top, bottom, corners. Use a good quality brush (I use Purdy, about $10. for a 2" wide brush) if you have a steady hand and a good eye. For the top edge along ceiling, get on the ladder, high enough to be almost eye level w/ the top edge.  If you do not think you can do this with a brush, there are some edge painting tools available.    Now start rolling.  Start in one corner at the top of the wall. Each roller full should cover approx. 2-3sq' of wall.  Paint each 2-3' section top to bottom then go onto the next section starting at the top and working down to the floor. Sort of in wide vertical stripes. This way, you will avoid any lap marks showing when the paint dries.  If you want to take a break, do not stop until the whole wall is finished.    Do not skimp on the paint quality, you will be sorry. You do not have to spend alot to get a good quality paint for instance...  Olympic carries a nice 0 VOC paint, no harmful chemicals, smells, etc. for about $22. Lowes carries this brand in hundreds of colors.  Dutch Boy has a low voc     I would suggest satin or eggshell for all rooms and hallways in the home but use satin only for bathrooms and kitchens.

lhOd2hvXaa	Small bubbles an inch or less in diameter are easier to repair than larger ones. With small bubbles, there usually is enough adhesive existing to reaffix the flooring to its substrate without adding glue.    Use a large sewing needle or a very thin ice pick to perforate the center of the bubble, all the way through the vinyl. The hole will allow trapped air to escape. Lay a towel over the area and use a hot iron to soften and flatten the flooring. Cover the warmed spot with several very heavy objects, large books for example. In most cases the floor, adhesive and substrate will rebond and your repair will be complete.    If the repair doesn't hold then you'll have to add a little glue (use the kind that comes in a syringe). Insert the tip of the syringe into the hole and add the glue. It takes only a few drops. Place a piece of wax paper between the floor and the object used as a weight. That way you avoid having a floor with a book glued to it.    Larger blisters don't require a syringe, but a scalpel or a razor blade will be needed.    First, use the towel and the iron to soften the vinyl. Next, use any razor-sharp tool to cut a cross in the blister. Carefully peel the four triangular sections back to expose the substrate. Be gentle. The softened flooring can be easily torn. Apply a thin layer of vinyl adhesive to the substrate and let it get tacky in accordance with the instructions on the can. Lay down the four sections, ensuring that they fit snugly against each other.    Again, use a book or another heavy object along with wax paper. In 24 hours, remove the object and wax paper, use lacquer thinner to clean up the excess adhesive and apply a thin bead of clear, vinyl seam-sealer to the two cuts.|`|FO0jlQFyaa	Katwala is right on the money.

AA10332086	Bob 438 is correct. The bigger the difference between the inside temperature and the outside temperature the more heat will leave the house through the walls and ceiling.     Of course you mentioned your home is very drafty. That can be an indication of large amount of cold air leaking into the house and a lot of warm air leaking out. This one of the biggest reasons for high fuel bills and one that you can really do something about if you are determined to fix the leaks. Air infiltration is separate from any temperature differences between inside and outside.    Doors, window and specially any access opening to the attic are the big culprits for air leakage.|`|pjGueC4xaa	The higher the temp, the more fuel needed to get there.    Turn down the thermostat at night, buy an electric blanket to keep you warm at night.|`|Ju4FuM2saa	Try sealing off some of the drafts.

You can call 2-3 contractors this way you will have a range as to what the repairs and labor will be.  You do not need to hire them to do the work.  This way you will know that the insurance company is paying you what you should be paid for the repair.  General rule is "what ever the material cost-- is what the labor is." Hope this helps.

Otherwise, if you can afford the house, then just relax, because the sun will come out tomorrow and everything will be fine.   Always, and I mean always have the house inspected before buying it.

83afe7Dvaa	Once your cutting is large enough to transplant, you put it into the sized pot you want (4", 1 gallon...). After a few weeks or months, depending on the climate and how fast it adapts to the pot, you will pinch it back to allow it to bush out when it begins to put on new growth. (You do not want to end up with the main stalk growing tall and no side shoots!) As it grows, you then prune it into the Christmas tree shape you want.    Topiaries are don't by allowing the main stem to grow up for a bit and then pinched back. If new shoots begin at the bottom, they are trimmed off. They are then placed into a wire frame for shaping, or twisted around itself for shaping or clipping to get a ball shape.    Good luck!

6N3yjlXhaa	Here is one quick method - http://gardenjunk.blogspot.com/2008/04/h...    If you want plain panels similar to the one shown in the above site, measure around the sides and bottom end of the mattress.    If you want the skirt around the entire mattress, include the top end too.    King - 76 x 80 inches.    California King - 72 x 84 inches .    For yardage, divide the measurement by 36" and then by 2 (you can split the yardage length-wise for the panels).     The standard King (entire perimeter of the mattress) would measure 312" / 36" =  8 2/3 yards / 2 = 4 1/3 yards.      Round up to 4 1/2  - fabric is seldom cut straight when purchased.    Fabric comes 45" - 60" inches wide.    Fold the yardage in half (length-wise) and you will have two panels, one for each side (22" - 30" drop).  Hemming will reduce the amount of drop.     Add 1/4 yard to the original yardage if you need to split the ends of the panels for the ends of the bed.      The extra yardage will allow for hemming the splint ends.     Fold the fabric length-wise and hold up in front of you by the selvage edges.     If the fold is wonky, slide (with your fingers) one side of the fabric until the fold is smooth - this will help assure the fabric is on-grain.      Press the fold and use this as your cutting guide.    Trim away the selvages  before sewing - they will make the fabric pucker and distort.    If you want gathers or pleats, more calculating needs to be done.

The chipboard should not creak when flexing.  This can happen with any type of sub-flooring.    One way to help alleviate this problem is to screw the chipboard down:    Drill holes about 1/8 inch deeper than the thickness of the chipboard over the floor joists where the squeaking occurs; force carpenters glue through the holes; then screw it down.    There is an advantage of having the odd squeak in your floor/stairs.

n560blqraa	Okay, so I did a little research regarding this question, and I came up with also Ebay, JT enterprises embroidered logo bedding, and craigslist that have Star Trek (not Star Wars bedding) The one's on ebay are really cool and colorful and sell for $79.99 (ouch) however it is in perfect condition. Also found another one on ebay for $63.99 not as colorful. The reason these are so expensive is they were only put out back in the 70's. I remember my brother having had this set when he was a kid. When I searched this it also pulled craigslist postings from various states. One was San Antonia. However, due to the vintage nature of Star Trek TOS it is going to be costly due to it being collectible. My best suggestion would be to wait until the summertime as Paramount is releasing Start Trek TOS movie in May of 2009 this year, and they are intending to bring back a lot of the vintage items like lunch boxes, bedding, curtains, etc. after the May 2009 release of ther movie. It should make it a lot less expensive and a lot easier to find in yopur regular stores like Walmart and Target after the movie comes out. Wait until summer when they start releasing all the products. If you choose not to wait...check out vintage textile companies for popculture textiles. Rubylane deals in vintage textiles. In addition, I have seen quite a bit of Star Trek fabrics available for purchase. One website is 4my3boyz.com selling by the yard. I also saw that janofabrics.com has the vintage fabric purchasable by the yard as well. If you google Star Trek fabric you will get an enormous amount of stores that have what you are looking for. It's pretty easy to create your own curtains, pillows. comforter, duvet cover, sheets, etc. Most of these places have special discounts depending on the amount of yards you buy.

That will run your water bill up in a hurry.|`|4rYDpMAgaa	Hello    I do not know about the water softener but water usage varies greatly from family to family    Some factors that effect the amount of water you use:    Number of people living in the house    Do you use the shower or do you fill up the Bathtub?    Dishwasher - how often used?    Clothes Washere - How often used?    Do you leave the tap running while rinsing dishes, brushing teeth, etc    Car washing    Lawn watering    Swimming pool    Hot tub      6000 gallons sounds about correct for the average home (200 gallons+ per day)    Here is a link which shows the average of water used per day    http://www.oikos.com/esb/42/wateruse.htm...|`|T5ToiqVUaa	I don't see why that would affect the water consumption. The water travels through the softener as you use it. It sounds like the water reader is not working well, it could be malfunctioning. I would look into making sure the reader is working properly.|`|ghi9atKVaa	No it would not have an impact on your bill it is water used.  There are a couple things you can do.   Put food coloring in the back of your toilet tanks,  leave it there for a 1/2 hour and go back and see if it is colored your bowl. If so you have a leak in the flapper and it should be replaced.   6 thousand gallons is not that much water for a month. How long are your showers? Some shower heads are 3-5 gallons a minute. Times that by two people taking two showers a day at 15 min and you have used a lot of water,  Not to mention dishes, toilet flushing etc.
ghi9atKVaa	Yes just don't use fabric softner and rise well.

U7tV0Jtjaa	You will need to use a rod that gives you enough clearance, depending on how much the blinds "stick out".  Measure the distance the blinds protrude into the room when they are open and add two inches or so, depending on the curtains you choose.  If you choose tab-top curtains, for example, they will need more clearance than ones that are tightly gathered at the top when open.  When you go to the store, you can buy a rod or fixture that has the right "return" once you know what your choices/needs are.|`|4uPnV0Qeaa	Hello,  I am a decorator based in Australia, the most practical way of solving this problem is to purchase a curtain track that has 10cm brackets in it. Install the brackets, ie one end bracket at each of the window and install the intermediate brackets in middle. Hang your track and then hang your new curtains. Always ensure that the vertical is still able to rotate and not fowl on the curtains. If it touching just move your curtain track brackets out further|`|iDLZ3gYVaa	A rod is your answer,....if you are doing it yourself you can get real creative in your choice of rods.  Look at your decor and try to repurpose something to make a unique rod.  For extention brackets look to the specialy jhardware places like True Value or Ace Hardware,...and sometimes Marine / Boat stores are the secret place to get the strange bracket you need!    If you get a plain rod, and want to cover the top of the whole thing decoratively, look up Cornice/Valance/Pelmet in ASK.COM and decide how you want to go!
gFHTcIc8aa	Canada Green Grass is a combination of cool season grasses: Kentucky Blue, Annual Rye and Red Fescue.  In the Transition zone, So. VA, Kentucky Blue can grow well if maintained properly and irrigated during summer months.   Annual rye will germinate quickly (7-10 days) and die once you reach winter and never come back. This may leave some brown patches and bare spots (after dying) and will outcompete other grasses in the mix during germination. The Red Fescue is a durable fescue which will has the best heat tolerance of the mix.    Note: During periods of excessive heat, grass must be watered so as to keep soil damp.  Grass will first go dormant and die rapidly if you do not water during the heat of summer.    As far as prep, use a herbicide that will kill any existing weeds in lawn.  Take a soil test to get existing nutrient & PH levels in your lawn.  Scrape soil or rent a slit seeder (much better results this way) to break surface for improved seed germination.  Insure you have a reliable means of irrigating lawn, this will be most important.    If you reseed in Spring, you will have to compete with crabgrass in summer.  You can put down a preemergent several weeks after germination, but this may not be as effective.  I usually opt for fall season reseeding/renovation because we have a big problem with crabgrass (and suspect you may have the same problem since we're in the same climate zone)|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Yes, I have. I used it in combination with grasses that are known to last here in Nevada. Reno is at 4,500' and it snows here.The combination guarantees something will nearly always be green on my lawn.I loosened up the soil to @1" depth and put down some fertilizer. I used both the pellet kind with a rotary spreader and manure. I left it for a few days and watered it like the seed was already in so it wasn't too "hot" for the new sprouting seed.After broadcasting the seed mix I watered two to three times a day for two weeks and then once or twice a day depending on how fast the ground dried out. Now I only water twice a week and my lawn looks great.
fvre0o9laa	From the sounds of things, the repair needed to bring it back to life are fairly minimal.  Do you have the rest of the machine?  If not, you might consider offering the top as-is for someone who is rebuilding an old machine.  Parts aren't always easy to come by!
AA10236289	Your drains are not vented properly.  The "fluids" fill up the diameter of the pipe and it wants to "suck air" to flow.  If there is no vent, or, your vents are plugged, then air will be sucked through the water trap in your drains and toilet.      EX:  Try dumping liquid out of a plastic bottle, holding it straight down.  It "gurgles" at it comes out.  If you put a small hole in the bottom, it will pour out smoothly.  Same principle happening with your drains.    Check your vents, if you have any.  They may be installed improperly.|`|VSWl45cKaa	I agree that you have a major clog in your drain that is filling up during the shower and only slowly draining. That is why flushing the toilet (a large amount of water) is casuing a backup. You need to get a plunger and put it over the the drain hole of the toilet. Plunge vigorously and I aean vigorously. Don't worry about splashing. It is only water. You have to try and free the clog this way. Chances are there is a wad of toilet paper causing the back up. This is the cheapest way to initially address the problem.    If this does not change the situation you may have a blocked pipe between the house and the sewer drain on the street. If that is the case you will need a professional to come in (like  ROTO-ROOTER) and clean out the pipes from the street back to your house.     Good luck.|`|2oc6TDiGaa	ya|`|4GCH1lTyaa	you definitely have a major clog or worse..a cracked or broken pipe..possible outside..how old is your plumbing..|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	May want to inspect your drains.  Could be clogged or you could have roots growing in your drains that is preventing them to drain properly.  Is not hard to repair but if you do not know what you are doing call a plumber.|`|0176bec1190980db12bdb38e1453e112aa	Are you on sewer or do you have a septic tank. It sounds like septic tank.  When a septic tank starts to get full, running lots of water will cause slow draining or "back flow" of water. This problem, left unchecked could eventually lead to raw sewage coming back up the drains and into sinks, toilets and bathtubs. GET IT CHECKED RIGHT AWAY|`|vl6OtBfWaa	I am a residential renovation contractor in Montreal Canada.    In most cases when 1 or more plumbing fixtures gurgle and drain slowly it is because the plumbing system is not drawing enough air this causes a type of vacuum and makes water drain slowly it can also make sewer gas escape from pipes causing a bad smell and it causes weird noises in pipes.    If you have added plumbing fixtures to an existing plumbing system in your house or added larger demand fixtures or even sometimes moved fixtures you can create this problem.      A plumbing sytem needs to draw air when draining or flushing.  We have plumbing stacks for this the end of your major (usually 4 inch) drain will connect to m municipal sewer lines (or septic tank) but it must also have an open and unobstructed exit on your roof.    You can add a special air valve in your wall that can alleviate this problem.|`|37xpELHoaa	Your sewer pipe could be getting clogged up, but it sounds to me like it could be a clogged vent stack. The best thing to do is call a drain specialist such as Roto-Rooter and have them come check it out. If you can't afford that, then search for your sewer cleanout out side and pull the cap to see if there is a bockage. With the cap off you can have someone flush the toilet and see if the water is making it to the cleanout, or pouring out of it. You can rent an auger if you think you can do it yourself. As far as the clogged vent goes, if that is what the problem is, you can climb up on the roof and check for obvious signs such as a bird nest or dead rodent near the top of  all the vent stacks. If it is a clogged vent not near the top, you would need to run the auger down the vent stack. Hope this advice helps.|`|8mvwFrNraa	I had this exact problem 2 months ago.  The vent was clogged.  Depending on how high your roof is, you can pour some water down it to try to flush it out, if not call the plumber.
Jy15drCtaa	Your GFCI is wired improperly. Follow below...    Always make sure that all wires are free of any debris (sand lightly to ensure a good connection.    a. Turn off power at the service panel. Use a circuit tester, if necessary, to make sure power is off.  b. Disconnect the white (neutral) wires from the silver screw (on/from the old receptacle).   c. Pigtail the white wires and connect the pigtail to the white line terminal on the GFCI.  d. Disconnect the black (hot) wires from the brass screw (on/from the old receptacle)  e. Pigtail the black wire and connect to the hot line on the GFCI.  f. If there is a ground wire attach it to the green screw. The GFCI will function without a ground, but there may be some local building code(s) to consider if doing so.  g. Mount the GFCI, restore power and test.     It should function well if you have followed the above.    If it does not, please check (with your volt tester) that the hot and neutral wires are in fact the hot and neutral wires. Wire according to the instructions above and you are done.    If it continues to malfunction, you have wired the outlet improperly, and you need to make corrections there (or disconnect the outlet permanently). If you continue to have issues, call a licensed electrician.|`|2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	The only possible reason is that you do not have a complete 110 circuit at the box.  When you changed it to a outlet and switch did the outlet work only when switch was on.  If so them what has happened is that at the light, one wire(usually the black) was brought down to the box so they could switch the light on and off by breaking the circuit.  If this is the case then the outlet would only work when the switch was on.  If the box had a white black and ground wire going through it then you need to hook the wires up to the outlet first(black to bronze screw, white to silver screw and ground to green screw).  Then take the white wire straight up to light and black through switch to light.  Do this off the line side of the outlet not the load because if you take it off the load it will treat your light as a outlet and could trip.
24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	probably not I'd think it would be a code violation|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Breaks in electrical wiring should never be repaired or taped up whether it be residential or commercial applications.  They are dangerous and can cause point loads and hot spots.    Change the cord completely if you are not comfortable with this type of repair bring the item to a qualified appliance repair person or have one visit you.    I am a contractor and I have personally seen a commercial customer refused an insurance settlement in a fire damage case because it was found he had extended wiring incorrectly.|`|2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	If you are asking if it is alright to repair a fraid or broken cord with electrical tape Im sorry but no.  Food institution and industriy and even hardware stores are required by OSHA (government institution)  to replace a broken or fraid cord and to inspect these cords once every 6 months(like any of them do) but that is the OSHA law.  if there is any moisture around or any chance of coming in contact with the wires I would have the company replace them.  Not hard to do and would prevent a lot of headaches later.
E0chY1b5aa	I agree with Eric; replace with exactly what came out even down to the letters.  Some are fast blow, some slow blow.  With all those sizes in there, someone, over the years, might have put a wrong one in (to stop blowing; big no-no).  Also, some of the codes have changed.  Get an electrictrician in there to open the box, compare wire size with fuse size and tighten everything down.  You may even have aluminum in there that needs to be inspected yearly.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	The fuse rating or "amperage" is a function of demand on the line.  This means some circuits in your house like the one that serves the stove demand a higher amperage than a circuit serving your lighting.  Replace the fuse that has blown with the same amperage or number visible on fuse.    Increasing amperage will put  a higher load on your wiring and can cause problems.  Also putting in lower amperage can cause you to blow a lot of fuses as the demand will exceed supply this is also not good.    When your electric system was first installed the load on your circuits was calculated by the electrician and should be adequate.    I will say this though if you can afford it or are thinking of ever renovating your electrical system should be first the type of system you have is old and obsolete it is not adequate for the demands of the average family (electronics computers big screen tv high capacity washers dryers and microwaves) all demand a lot of amps.    A new electric system will protect both your expensive goods and your home.|`|LJM0zMNPaa	STOP !  Only replace fuses with EXACTLY the same size(rating) as the one you want to remove. It is PERFECTLY normal to have different size fuses in a circuit breaker box.  Thinner wire gest the smaller fuse. If you you a larger fuse that the original YOU WILL BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN.    Eric|`|V0ltn3Qkaa	fuses are gaged by the size of the wire on the circuit that they control. if you were to put to large (higher amperage) of a fuse on a particular, you run the chance of the wire over heating and possibly catching on fire, before the fuse would ever blow.|`|AR2lbLwQaa	No one told you this:   14 wire -use 15amp fuses   12 wire -use 20 amp fuses   10 wire-use 30 amp fuses    Code calls for fuse adapters to be in so as not to replace  with the wrong size fuses.
AA11988604	stiffen the rails under the table that carry the load from leg to leg.  be careful in how you approach this to not limit the movement of any sliding mechanisms for adding and removing leafs.   But in general, it sounds like the maker used wood that wasn't dry enough, or wood dimensions that were not strong enough to bear the load.    Does the table have a rectangular frame under the top?  Are there any breaks in the material from leg to leg?  It should either be one continuous span of wood or a strong joint or a laminated beam made of staggered pieces with ends butted in separate locations for each layer of the lamination.  Anything less would help explain the bowing.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	on the leafs you mean?  If they are stored horizontally (laying flat on the ground) they should tend to bow less because gravity is working with you.  When they are stored on ends, they tend to bow like heck.    If it's solid, I don't really know what to do.|`|WV65jddJaa	You would need to add additional center support, either a center leg or a stronger center beam piece.|`|qNVP4Q1Saa	Like Jim C said. Center support.  You can make one easy that you can make a mount for it as well. the center of a long table is deep enough that you wont see the unmatching leg. Just make sure that you have stained it similar so it looks the same color. Supports will not work and will look horrible and the person who made the table will be insulted if you destroy the table. Truth is that even professionally made table that are long will sag that have leafs. The sliders are all sloppy, they kind of have to be. also make it so you can take it out to make the table smaller again.
nYBsbm4haa	Good water flow, water pressure, fresh dishwasher detergent, and warm water are all needed for the dishes in your dishwasher to get clean. If the water is not hot enough, the dishwasher can not clean dishes as effectively as possible. To test the temperature, turn on the hot water on your sink to see if the water is getting warm quickly. The selector switch on your dishwasher may let you select a higher temperature setting. You can try that to see if it helps with cleaning. Be careful if you increase the water temperature of your household hot water tank. Your hot water tank should be set to deliver water at about 120F. This may help, but you dont want to get scalded by it when taking a shower or washing your hands either. Most dishwashers use an internal heater to increase the water temperature to 140-150 degrees Fahrenheit before it will start cycling the dishwater through the spray arms. On some models you can use the Added Heat or Wash Heat Boost selection to increase the wash water temperature. Some dial timer models will let you select Hot Start or other extended washing cycles.    To keep the water free of debris during recirculation, every dishwasher has some kind of filter. Excessive food debris may clog internal filters. Make sure you at least scrape the dishes into the trash first. On some models these filters are self-cleaning, and they don't need to be cleaned regularly. Other models have filters in the bottom of the tub that you do need to clean. You can easily remove these filters. If a filter is full of debris, the water can not circulate properly, and could be causing the dishes to remain dirty. Check to make sure the filter is not blocked or clogged with debris.|`|jWtquDVUaa	I don't know what you used for a cleaner that would have caused this. But a good cleaner to use is citric acid that you can get at your local grocery store, Just run an empty load with just the citric acid. Also if you are seeing this on your clear items it could be caused by, hard water, old soap, or etching (which is when your water is too hot). Also just to add to the Jet Dry it does also help with water spots. And instead of Jet Dry you can use white vinegar in it's place a lot less expenssive and does the same thing.|`|DTlFaJkaaa	most new dishwashers need jetdry (i guess you'd say need, they all seem to have a special reservoir for it).  The white spots could be fromo hard water.  I tend to see the same with ours, but it's a real cheapo from Holmz Depot.|`|61itEiq4aa	Use a rinse aid|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Did you fill the small tank located on the door with "jet dry"  this is a product which causes a rapid drying time for hot water and will leave no spots on glasses.    If you have filled this I would check water temperature the hotter the better,  if your water is not hot enough can cause water spots.    Also if your water is "hard water" then you can sometimes have water spots.|`|ARmhMq5laa	i would say let it run through a few rinse cycles and then see what happens,you might have used too much of whatever it was to clean it.  or you could just use your dishwasher as a drain for the dishes you wash if you can't find out what's going on,that's what i do:)|`|ghi9atKVaa	hard water?|`|M3kI4KTMaa	You probably don't need a special cleaner.  I would suggest using a high quality dishwashing soap, but only use half the amount you usually use.  You HAVE to use Jet Dry (or comparable) on newer dishwashers.      Here are more tips:  http://www.ehow.com/how_4714817_dishwash...
AA11474133	Most likely the fan and light are fed from the same circuit.  If this is the case there would be a wire nut connecting two wires, one to each switch, and one or more power wires together.  The other wire on each switch would go to the fan and light and not be connected together at all.  If you find that none of the wires are connected together, then the two switches could be separate circuits.   Then you'd have to replace the two switches with a 2-pole switch (which would have 4 screws not counting a ground).    But assuming it is one circuit, you'll need to wire nut the two wires for the light and fan together with a short wire to connect to the switch (either one).  You can leave the other switch in place with nothing connected to it (it won't control anything).  If you removed it you'd have to find a faceplate with a blank where the missing switch is.  You must use the wire nut--you cannot connect two wires to one screw.|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Yes.  Turn off the circuit breaker to the bath and remove the faceplate on your switches.  Then unscrew your switches.  Will need to determine which wire attached to the switch to your fan feeds the fan.  Just attach this wire to the other switch.  I would probably come off the switch with a single wire and then attach the two wires feeding your light and your fan to that single wire with a wire nut.  The wires coming in from the circuit could be wired to the switches in different ways, cannot accurately describe how to take the fan switch off the circuit without seeing it.    This probably does not meet electrical code, I am not a licensed electrician.  You may consider getting a 20 amp switch to replace your current one just to keep it from getting too hot.

FxWppY7Baa	Buy a shop light fixture, light weight dog chain and two florescent bulbs for the shop light fixture. Hang the lights from the ceiling with the chains. the chains will allow you to adjust the lights as the seedlings grow. You do not need grow lights as a study by the Rodale Institute proved that plain old florescent lights work as well or better than Gro-Lux lights for about 1/4 the price.    Get a good soiless potting mix with no fertilizer in it (seeds and seedlings do not need fertilizer until about 1 month old) and also get some seed starting trays (these sometimes come with the soil already in them). Prep the trays (fill with soiless mix) and add the seed, water lightly (use a quart pressure sprayer which you can buy for under $10 at any box store. You will use this a lot. Put this on light mist to water seeds) and put these under the light fixture. if a clear dome came the the seed trays put that on to keep the seeds from drying out (remove the dome when the seeds germinate). You do not need to turn the lights on until the seeds germinate. When they do adjust the lights so they are no more than 1" above the tops of the seedlings and keep the lights on for 14 to 18 hours a day (it is nice to have the lights on a timer so you don't have to remember to turn on/off the lights. Especially bad if you remember this at work). As the seedlings grow adjust the height of the light as needed (about every 2 days).    If you want to spend about $200 you can get a table top light shelf from Jung's seeds but this method will cost no more than $35 and you can use the lights for years or your Hubby can steal them and use them in his shop if he wants    See my blog http://boulderbelt.blogspot.com/2008/03/... for some pictures of my set up|`|WV65jddJaa	Depending on how many plants you want to start and what type of seeds you want to start you can use a regular clay pot and seed starting medium.  fill the pot just about three quarters full and moisten.

5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	I agree AMO 45 !  Laundry soap will work in a pinch.  Gee, if you don't like Tide, use Gain, or Shout.  I would recommend using liquid soaps. and I would probably only use no more than 1/4 cup as laundry soap will suds up.  Dawn would not be good to use in a steam cleaner.      Some people will use 1 cup of a low sudsing ammonia and 2 cups of white vinegar and top off with water.  If you have animals you may wish to exclude the ammonia and just use vinegar.  And yes, the vinegar smell does not linger and will leave your carpets smelling fresh.    Personally, unless you have a particular alergy to some chemical in the carpet shampoo, I would just use whatever the steam cleaner recommends.  For additional freshness, add vinegar.    Always test carpets for colorfastness, no matter what you use...|`|xFm5wzuXaa	I have never heard of a worse idea, they have chemicals in there also not just soap, I can not believe someone said Tide and water, DO NOT DO THAT it will never come out.|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	I also used laundry detergent once when i ran out of carpet shampoo with 1/2 a room left to go.it worked so well its all i use now! mixed 1/4 cup to a tank of water. it also left them with a wonderful fresh scent -much nicer than carpet shampoo scent.|`|zrthZOCdaa	Take TIDE and mix with water.  It cleans clothes, & it will also clean carpet.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	I agree...I certainly wouldn't use laundry soap since the enzymes that whiten, brighten, etc could cause the carpet to discolor.    For myself, I use a bit of Dawn dishwashing soap mixed up with some water, and hand scrub the carpet with a stiff bristled brush. Once the carpet is clean, I rinse and extra the water using my home rug shampooer.

Oq5a5hRhaa	You can always try putting down orange peels around your house.    Cats hate the smell of citrus.    Or, you could try having them leave and then shutting the door. If you put food out on the other side of your yard at dusk, they will probably all go over to get it.    Note that the Louisiana SPCA will only trap the cats, spay or neuter them, and return them to your home. It is their policy not to relocate feral cats. (See link.)    You can buy the traps yourself, but since you have so many of them, they will probably eventually get wise to it and stop going in there.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Get a live catch trap and bait the traps with fresh canned cat food. You'll catch them one a t a time with injuring them. What you do with them at that point is up to. I suggest drowning them humanely because they are likely to be suffereing from disease or possibly even rabies. The Humane Center would probably also euthanize them.|`|xlPHWQQSaa	Since they are strays food may be the answer.  Unless there is some food source under your house they have to come out to hunt.  Put a container of tuna or some other smelly food at a distance in your yard, when they come out close the opening under your house.  After that they probably will go elsewhere for shelter.|`|sSgwjh6Uaa	Hi, my firs thought was an animal rescue, there are powders or sprays you can mix with water and it tells them another cat is there now and they move on, there are electronic devices that send out high pitched sounds that are supposed to scare cats off as they approach the device.  High powered water pistols.  Or I heard if you live near a zoo or big cat park you ask the lion keepers for some lion poop, it stinks to hell and scares off anything!

pbZywicUaa	You could have so much fun by going to your local Thrift shops, the Goodwill, or the Salvation Army. They all have some really great pieces for your room, at a very low price. You can take them home and paint them and make them your own. Paint your walls a light color, it will make your room seem larger. If you have dark carpet on the floor, buy yourself a light rug, even it it's a small one to go beside your bed. Add some shelves on the wall and paint them bright white. Look for a new lamp in one of the Thrift stores and hot glue some beading to the bottom of the shade yourself. Add a couple of nice throw pillows for your bed. Add a couple of really nice posters to the wall. You can make your room look more grown up and yet it still be YOUR personality for very little money. Have fun with this, you can do it.

I would suggest that you start with your closet, because you can easily orgainize yourself there, and once you get the organization bug it'll take over your entire room!  First, get 3 large empty boxes, you can get these for free from the grocery store.  (Banana boxes and apple boxes are great!)  Label the outside of each box.  Make the first box "keep", the second box "give away" and the third box "trash."  Start at the top of your closet on the shelves, and work your way through an entire shelf, taking each thing down and putting it in the box it belongs in.  When you're completely done with an entire shelf, return the "keep" things to it, and empty your trash box in the trash can.  Then on to the next shelf, repeating this process.  When your "give away" box is full, put those things in a plastic bag outside of your bedroom, and bring your empty box back into your bedroom.  When you go through your hanging items, try them on, and if they're not usable, toss them!  Same for the shoes....  Once you've gotten your closet tackled set out shelf by shelf and dresser by dresser through your entire room...  As you pare down on your belongings you can think about your style...  With a few dollars in your budget you can look at a few organization tricks, and I searched on eBay for you for orgainzers, and you can get some ideas for some good organization tricks, and not spend much money.  By going through and giving away and throwing away unwanted things from years past, you'll be going through the natural gradual process of allowing more mature items into your life.  And the process of taking care of your things shows maturity, and you'll feel more mature.      Once you've gone through your entire room, think about your color and perhaps paint might be an option.  If you're not able to paint your walls, you might buy an inexpensive bulletin board and paint it, to get some fresh color!  And then you could buy some inexpensive fabric to drape over your dressar to tie in the new color theme.    Have fun!|`|rGwbn1Emaa	go to online stores, you'll surely find stuff there...check out my other questions...|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	start by sorting through you're things all the "Kiddie 'items stuffed animals,posters and that sort of things can be packed away- while you're at it get rid of any clothes you no longer wear or have out grown any items that are in good condition you can take to a consignment shop and make a little money too If you can- paint your furniture -a black satin will give a newer ,more modern look.get some shelving and paint it the same color that will make even mismatched pieces look "together" if you have curtains and or blinds/shades get rid of them and replace them with new bamboo ones it will open up and modernize your room as well you can try ikea.com for some ideas

5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	I did the whole research thing. I never really agree with Consumer reports...   I chose mine after reviewing several reviews from owners.  Dyson is a reallly expensive vacuum, and not even a highly recommended by CR.  I have a fur machine that has free access to outdoors to add yard debris to the fur factory.  I have a combination of area rugs, carpet, tile, and hardwood.  I bought a Bissel Liftoff.  I purchased it for about 125.00 on sale.  I have been extremely pleased with both function, power, and price.  It doesn't use bags and is simple to empty, and the best thing is the suction unit can be removed simply  from the upright unit so that you can use it as a canister vacuum for stairs, going out to the car, or ect.  It has the standard attachments, but the upholstry brush works exceptionally well.  I bought expensive vacs at one time and I was extremely dissatisfied.  I am very happy with this one.  I've had it for 9 months now with no problems or loss of power.  My expensive vacs required hepa filters changed with very little use, do to poor design for their hepa exhaust.  The Bissel Liftoff is a good solid and inovative vacuum designed in particular for pet owners.  I think you would be very pleased and save a good deal of cash.|`|AA10685211	Consumer Reports is always a great place to find out which one works best.    http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index...|`|GTjkWZPlaa	The Dyson Animal.  It's made especially for people with pets.  I have one and I love it.  I have 2 dogs and it picks up all the dog hair like you wouldn't believe.

Dyson vacumms arent that good.  Especially if your planning on using it often and if your cleaning area is fairly large.    Lots of problems with my dyson vacuum|`|TJpQZju2aa	honestly none of them are very good.  They are cheaply made.  If you're going to spend in excess of $300 for a vacuum, I would suggest going with a Riccar or a Simplicity.  I have had my Riccar canister vac for 2 years now, and I dust less and breathe better.  Plus the company has a great parts guarantee1
SZdVYrSSaa	GO FOR THE EUREKA!!!    The Dyson "never looses suction" claim is 100 percent true, and this can be a wonderful selling point for the virgin Dyson buyer... However, the high price tag is very much one that you will find you have wasted.     While there are many Dyson satisfied customers, the fact remains that while their technology is brilliant, the production value is very low. The plastics used are cheap and breakable. If they don't crack or break off within the first few weeks, as mine did, just wait a few months until they begin to warp, and the tubes no longer fit in certain regions. It is a splendid design, if only they had put as much caring into their craftsmanship.    What I can promise you with the Eureka, is that while it is simple, it is tough. The vac is known for being a survivor, and yes, you may experience some loss of suction here or there, but it is nothing that a bent up coat hanger and ten minutes can't fix.     If you happen to have a multimillion dollar income, and throwing $600 at a Dyson is like throwing a dime on the ground, then go for it and replace it again next month when something breaks off. If, however, you happen to live much like say... a Yale graduate with a few hundred thousand dollars in college loans to pay off each month... please don't waste your time on the Dyson design.|`|8uauS9aAaa	I have the Animal and I'm not that impressed. Maybe it's just mine but I don't think it picks up as well after only 2 years.    Edit- I need a replacement brush and they are impossible to find. Dyson themselves don't even sell them.|`|AA11364883	I would go with the Eureka. A couple of weeks ago I was in a little mom and pop sew and vac to pick up a belt. I saw a bunch of dysons laying around the back of the store. I asked the guy what was up with them. he said they were all in for repair. I told him I thought they were supposed to be a great vacuum. He said they were junk. He then showed me a few of them and the problems they have. I was really surprised. They are made almost completely of plastic. He said that parts break on them all the time.  Personally I would recommend the Bissel Pet Eraser. I have 5 cats and a Golden Retriever. You want to talk about Hair !!!! The Bissel works really good on pet hair.|`|vgJHq2Mvaa	Hi, A friend who has pets bought a Eureka boss smart vac ultra 4870 and she loves it. She said it was recommended by a leading consumer magazine and rated right up there with higher priced vacuums. It was priced around 150.00 and really cleans carpets and bare floors with the flick of a switch. Has hepa filtration, 8 carpet settings, convenient tools and ability to control suction when using tools. Hope this helps.  http://www.byvacuumcleaners.com/Eureka-b...
I40vnqNyaa	Wow sounds like you have one audacious rat!  Rather than poison it and have it die and stink up your house, try one of these traps. I have traps that i bought at the local hardware store that only cost a few dollars each, and are very effective for catching large rodents. The traps are a rectangular box style trap made from very hard wire. One end of the trap has a door on it that allows the rat to enter the trap but once inside is unable to get back out. These traps can also be reused as many times as you need. Very simple design, but works very well. Put a couple of these up in your roof or wherever your little friend likes to hang out. Rats are scavengers so it wont take it long to sniff out whatever irresistable scraps you choose to put inside. Once your little friend is inside you just pick up and carry the trap by the handle and dispose of him however you choose. Its better than the awful smell your left with if you poison it and it dies up in your roof or inside a wall cavity. Give it a try  :)|`|a01e4b2cbf639961f2d6add54036adefaa	Dcon sells rat baits that you put out and they eat.  My daughter had one in her new house that wasnt scared of them either and we used the bait for him.  Seems to have worked, havent seen or heard him in a while.

XgOIlU0eaa	i'm assuming your tstat is digital....its normal for digital tstats to cycle on and off with the displyed temp never changing..this is because they display in whole numbers but they actually read the temp in 10ths or even 100ths of a degree.....so a typical scenario would be...tstat set at 67...room temp exactly 67,,heat off....room temp drops to 66.7,heat turns on..room temp rises to 67.3,heat turns off...the whole time the tstat displays the closest whole number for the room temp which is 67 the whole time...some higher end digital tstats have adjustable sensativety,,mine is a bryant tstat,i can choose between 1 through 9, 1 being the most sensative,shortest on/off cycles...i keep mine on 2 or 3...i prefer the house to be exactly what i set it for,not 1 degree or more cooler before heat turns on,then 1 deg or more above set temp before heat turns off..............dan|`|2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	Not sure but if it is a electronic thermostat it may do that as some are set with a one degree variance.  I know mine is because at 2 degrees it will kick on  the coils in the furnace.  Dont think it is right but so far the furnace people cant get it to do anything else so Im living with it.|`|twWUwIxzaa	You could have one of the following problems:    If you live where there is snow fall, check to be sure your furnace vent is not blocked by snow fall.    If that isn't the case the antisipator switch, which is located in you thermostat needs to be reset. This little slide switch tells the furnace how many degrees it will allow the room temp to drop before the furnace comes on. You can adjust this yourself by removing the cover from the thermostat, it will just pry off, and look for a small arrow pointing to a plus minus scale. If you want the furnace to come on more often then move the switch to the positive and to the minus   side to have it wait longer before turning on again.
5c33a755ef9b542e1bec57c8a02ea6f4aa	I highly recommend the Bissel Liftoff.  I am very pleased with mine.  It works well on carpet, area rugs, and bare floors.  Additionally, you can easily remove the suction unit from the upright to use as a canister vac for stairs, cleaning out the car, ect, ect.  It has all the standard attachments and the upholstery brush is phenominal for picking up pet hair from fabric.  There are no bags to buy,  empties easily, and doesn't lose suction like some of the more expensive Kenmore-highy rated vacuums that I've purchased before.  It was inexpensive and truly the only vacuum you'll ever need.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	Rainbow or Electrolux, very expensive.|`|jHWgdJMraa	Dyson vacums are awsome, there expensive but you can get them 1/2 off if you buy a refurbished one on the net
pffEqA9aaa	If you're handy with tools you can install one yourself ($800 total).  http://www.amazon.com/Mighty-Mule-FM200-...  http://outdoors.pricegrabber.com/lawn-eq...    Or the same local companies that install garage doors can sell and install a gate opener for you (I'm thinking for around $1,200 total)    One last note about the cost:  You'll need to have some electricity at the gate.  You said there weren't any lights there, so I'm thinking no electricity either.  So you have two options for power:  1) Buy a solar recharged battery driven system (which means you might need to double up on the batteries and solar panels - for the days when many visitors might run a smaller battery system out of juice).    2) Run electricity over to the gate (see 2a and 2b below).  2a) Most companies will probably suggest bringing120 Volts AC to the gate - probably pretty expensive for a 12 acre place.  2b) My suggestion is buy a battery powered system, so that the electric run from your house/garage/barn (whichever is closer to the gate) can be a low voltage system not requireing expensive protection that 120 VAC does.  Now this kind of solution will work best with a battery placed at the gate - so the very long wires are only to recharge the battery - it's such a long run that the motor probably wouldn't work properly without a battery located near it).

n560blqraa	It's a huge misconception in interior design that painting a wall a richer color will visually diminish the size of a room.  However, painting a faux finish on the walls on the walls would become overly reflective and any inconsistencies in your drywall or any small damage would become more pronounced as a result of reflective silver stripes. Drywall is imperfect and hence would show more imperfections as a result of a reflective choice. There's a massive difference in painting a wall in a deep rich color vs. dark. Stay away from extremely dark shades and go more neutral based.  This will give you the beautiful compliment between timeless tradition and modernity you are looking for and will match beautifully to brushed nickel knobs.  As far as ther border goes..Take it down,,,when you apply a border in a room you visually diminish your ceiling height giving the illusion of shorter ceilings. When you choose your ceiling color go pure bright white or go two shades lighter than a wall color on a color wheel. One of the most beautiful bathrooms I have ever done was with brushed nickel knobs, pure brite white trimwork and ceiling, and an artichoke green color for the walls. Artichoke is not a green color... it is a more neutral greenish, brown undertones making for a more subtle but visually striking difference against pure white trim.  In addition raise your bar on your shower curtain all the way up almost to the ceiling to give the illusion of taller ceiling. (remove border) Also bring your curtain rod all the way up as well same thing a few inches below ceiling height. Be sure to accomodate differencef in curtaine size for shower so it billows and reacghes floor and accomodate size for window height. One last trick....You have 3 mirrors....take corner mold from your local hardware store and frame out each one individually as if they were pictures(create frames) Natural neutral is where you want to stay to achieve classy elegance. I am a home real estate investor/designer and have used this technique with great success on properties I have done. I hope this helps!

When my husband and I ran a real estate investment firm we looked into them thinking that perhaps it could save us money on cabinetry, furnishings, etc. for our various homes we were refurbishing. When we compared their annual membership against the cost of an average sofa, local cabinetry companies. Lowes, Home Depot, etc. They far exceeded the cost of what we spend vs. save. Home Depot, Lowes, Costco's, BJ's. etc. are far better deal to purchase new bathroom vanities, cabinetry etc. As the savings is enormous through these stores on closeouts, discontinued items, dented box goods, etc.  I could remodel an average sized kitchen via Home Depot's upgraded cabinet line and install them with purchased brand new appliances for a quarter of the cost of their annual over $5,000 membership alone. In addition, based upon your geographical location me CT. does not allow the convenience of even having an abundance of showrooms available to me. My husband and I went to the appt. for Direct Buy and walked in with a calculator having been in the remodeling industry, walked out thinking these guys have quite the money making scam. The uptick of the cost of products alone is so severe that you are actually overpaying through them.  I hope this helps!|`|s30Duwdraa	Last I heard, it was $5000 per year.    And I was told it is definitely worth it.  Something you may want to do is see if someone else is interested and split the cost.  Only one of you will be able to make purchases but you can work something out...|`|AA11294818	It's a few thousand bucks, but it's NOT worth it.  I'll never ever get a membership through them, even if it was offered for free. My husband and I were to receive a wedding gift from a Direct Buy member... (it was a washing machine and dryer), the washing machine was obviously completely destroyed upon arrival and we made dozens of calls to reluctant Direct Buy to replace it. They finally agreed but still wouldn't take responsibility for the damage. So it's been 3 months and yet still no washer. I'm so angry. I am working full time, schooling full time and fricken pregnant, the last thing I need is to go to the laundromat on my 'time off' which I don't have.    I have half a mind to go and dropkick two specific Direct Buy employees' washing machines to their deaths. Their customer service is terrible. They putz around their offices and take like one full week to 'recover' from getting back from vacation before they deal with any business matters, it seems.    So yeah, it's a few thousand dollars for a membership, a membership to a crap club. It's NOT worth it, I had the worst experience with them and I'm just a gift recipient! I hope they go under. I also hope their washers all stop working in their personal homes.|`|05bV2GuFaa	It depends what you want to do. If you just want to furnishing your place, then it is better to work with local furniture shop (not designer's because they charge you fee and sometimes they making commission on the furniture you are buying). Pick a furniture store with what you like (not the big chain), then check with them to work on prices. And you will get better price for the big house worth than buying a set.    If you are doing it for investment purpose, like staging or remodel - work with local vendor to get a price for projects. It is also better to do it that way. Also, lots furniture stores mark up price high and sale them at 50%, but honestly, the item might only worth 30% of its "retail price".  The best way to check the price is look around for certain brands that has published prices and to see how the store is willing to work with you.    If not, you can contact me. I do have a furniture store in Washington DC area.|`|SKqV374maa	you can take a free tour of the store and find out if it's right for you  go to there web site to get free pass|`|72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	If you like a high pressure sales pitch to sign on the dotted line while they try and fleece you of $5000 or MORE, go ahead, go!  You will regret it.  I have heard all the pitches, seen the comparisons.  But I can tell you, unless you shop on Rodeo Drive  in California exclusively, you can do better than their prices, which are NOT the rock bottom prices they claim.  Notice all the people in their ads are dripping in money, which you would have to be to pay their ridiculous MEMBERSHIP FEES and then PAY for their overpriced stuff.  If you have money to burn, do it!  If you are like the rest of us, RUN!  A waste of time and money and not only that, you have to arrange a lot more stuff, unless you are right next door to one.  And BTW, if you have a problem with ANYTHING of theirs, don't count on their customer service, as it is NON-EXISTENT!  Hope this helps you!  Good luck!|`|479ef4dddb7cc9e722bc3eec6afc0f17aa	what is direct buy?|`|70cb7d43b37cc2c7aeea03d81cdc272caa	New membership is about $5000 which  is good for 3 years, then I believe it's about $300 per year after that. If you are looking to remodel, or are constantly buying home improvement items or furniture or even household items then yes, I would say it's worth it because it can really save you a lot of money.|`|XqDTyY6Yaa	IT IS $3.50, I HAVE USED IT TO POOP|`|a6vU1nT7aa	Allow me to let you in on an industry secret. In my short time on this earth I have sold, designed and worked for many distributors, designers and retailers. Direct Buy is not only a waste of solid time and money but it isn't directly buying from anyone other than a middle man. DB as well as other counterparts and wholesalers are selling to you, the consumer at yet a retail price, never wholesale or net because you the consumer do not have a resale tax id or Net terms with the manufacturer. Many of the goods sold to you at these places are bought in bulk, are overstock or poor quality. If you were to go to a furniture store, a quality one like Smithe in Chicago, you could by a 1000 table for 800. The store bought that table for 400, they got a deal because they purchased multiples of that same table or other goods in a large qty. from that manufacturer. IF you are paying up front fees to be able to use it in the first place you are not saving anything, you just paid the difference in your discount. Even so, wonder why builders and contractors, designers as well as architects dont use DB? Because it's not a deal and you CAN find it somewhere for less and get the same poor customer service and may even be able to score a warranty or ability to return. You wouldn't want to buy a kitchen based on your measurements and not have a company come out to measure, template and take responsibility for any mis ordered merchandise would you? If not, DB is not the way to go. Only makes sense if you are a house flipper, in which case, wrong economy. Don't bite the bait.
n560blqraa	Marble is unfortunately a very porous stone and hence stains quite easily. Water can stain marble alone. It requires the use of a neutral cleaning agent as to not damage or scratch the stone. Neutral agents are baking soda,hydrogen peroxide, and cornstarch. Always be sure that when cleaning marble to blot the stain rather than wiping. Wiping a stain on marble will cause it to spread further over the stone. For future to keep your marble lamp looking good there are various marble sealants available to prevent future staining. Be sure to make a paste out of baking soda and water and blot which is good for juice stains or any acidic based stain that may have gotten on it. Hydrogen peroxide would dbe better if this is a food based stain that may have splashed on the lamp. If it is grease or oils from fingers cornstarch is the best way to go. If it's from nail polish use liquid hand soap and luke warm water and blot the stain out. Don't let the diswash liquid stand to long and repeat process and steps til stain is gone. I hope this helps!|`|XqDTyY6Yaa	LICK THEM OFF|`|961201972c5f4d5688e0a40c19dcbb81aa	I don't know for sure, but I've heard lighter fluid works.
M3kI4KTMaa	I would suggest cleaning everything in your home.  Wash your sheets in hot water (and bleach if they are white).  Wash your pillow cases and pillows.  Vacuum your carpet well.  Sprinkle baking soda on your carpets since bugs don't like that.      Here is something I found on how to get rid of ants, which will probably help for getting rid of all bugs:  http://www.ehow.com/how_4763152_rid-of-a...|`|AA11607818	Have the sheets been washed? May be they're lingering in places that the exterminator doesn't treat and you haven't though to clean.
