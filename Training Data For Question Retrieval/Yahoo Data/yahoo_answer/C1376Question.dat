20090225024035AAUiPFG	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Meaning to this dream about my boyfriend...?	well my dreams usually have 3-4 different parts but this is the first part.      -i had a dream that my boyfriend was having sex with a girl while i was on the phone with him-   ok so i was at home & he wasnt on yahoo or anything & he wouldnt answer his texts so naturally, i called him. & he answered & all i heard was a girl moaning. & i was screaming his name tryna make him talk but he wouldnt so i hung up. i called back & i heard the same thing & he STILL wouldnt talk but this time i heard him moaning a little so i knew he was there. i hung up & called back for the last time & he finally started talking [i could tell he was having sex] & i said " javier wtf are you doing?" & he said "im fu**ing someone." & i said "wtf why are you doing this?" & he said "i had to get it somewhere." & i said "f**k you i hate you." & he said "babe why are you so mad?" & i said "because your over there fu**ing someone & i cant do anything about it." (& i guess because im always out of minutes i said): "i cant believe im using my minutes on this." & he said "babe chill you have like 60 minutes." & i said "i hate you." & hung up.   [[ hes in california with his family right now & thats why i couldnt do anything about him & another girl ]]    so what is the meaning to this?   i told him about it & he just blew it off.   so... any help here?   thanks

My coz thoughts run along the lines of my thought starts at a there are 4 viable options to take and will; choose the appropriate one and its a logical linear progression.   My thoughts were more like a brain storming session with labels and arrows everywhere.   Our thought processes were completely different.   Now we share alot of the same DNA and have the same educational background, however, we differ in terms of gender and the fact I'm dyslexic.   Now can anyone tell us : Do people all think differently? Are their gender differences in thinking? Does dyslexia actually change your way of thinking and in what way do you think?

There are 3 people working on a presentation(a,b and c)  They all have fluency in one common language; a and b them also speak a language unknown to c.     When discussing the task at hand, a speaks their thoughts in the uncommon language, b, who understands answers in the common language - perhaps so that c can get an idea of what is being said, and because they are conscious that communication must be as high as possible.      Would person c become withdrawn in this type of group? or would they work harder as if to ignore person a?

20090225032600AAuoauP	Social Science;Psychology	Nasty remarks from this woman I work with?  Why is she doing this?	We were having a discussion about parks and bringing children into them..and this female colleague told me that she saw some weird stuff going on recently so she doesn't bring her children there anymore. I asked 'what kind of weird stuff' and she replied very dismissively 'oh, you wouldn't understand, you don't have children'. I replied, 'oh I would, I have nieces and nephews and I was a child myself once'. Another time, she said to me 'oh, many of my friends got pregnant on purpose when they reached 40 & hadn't met a guy'. I answered 'that never happened to me'. The fact is I've never married or had children, am a few years older than her and live a lovely life, contracting & travelling in between. I feel she is giving me mean digs. Why is she doing this to me? It seems so rude.

I live in SoCal so it starts out that I'm at the LA Zoo, who knows why, but then I'm just wandering along and the zoo suddenly merges with Dodger Stadium. This isn't the stadium everyone knows, it's much larger and configured much differently.       All of a sudden I'm not at Dodger stadium, but trying to get to Long Beach via some bus. I ask the driver how I can transfer to get to LB. He tells me of all these different options, and to look for certain drivers only.

I am tired of comparing both instances and reading the same things! Males always give the same answer despite the gender that's asking!      The question is...

20090225044722AAqweKW	Social Science;Psychology	Why is it that self-help industries always get a bad reputation?	Hello there!      I mean, people like to think that most of the self-help gurus and motivational speakers are simply frauds out there cheating your money by encouraging you to buy their books and attend their seminars.       Since one man's trash is another man's treasure and I don't deny that there are really self-help con men out there eagerly want to force their empty promises down your throat, but certainly there are honest hearted gurus want to help you sincerely, so wouldn't that be a little bit overgeneralize to call them all something like cheater or boaster?      Furthermore, I don't really think that earning money through giving self-help speeches and tips is somehow immoral, as long as the speaker herself lead a moral life and thus become an ideal model. In this case, audiences can pick up good ideas and utilize them while the speakers are conducting their jobs, so it becomes a win-win scenario.   So overall I think it is rather unfair to dub self-help industry as a whole as a swindling syndicate.       Thanks!

I've been on this section a few times because my contacts starred a question from here and each time I notice the same bunch of guys posting questions and leaving offensive answers.      I could understand if it was a bunch of trolls trying to get a rise out of people, but the ones I'm talking about are actually serious.      Why would they waste so much time in here just to put people down? It's odd. I guess it's like those people who invade the LBGT section, I think it all boils down to insecurity. (I know everyone makes jokes about the opposite sex and other people and that's normal cause it's just a joke, no need for anyone to get offended, but I can't understand what people get from spending so much time in here trying to prove they're superior?).

I am a sophomore, attending college in Florida while he lives in New Jersey. I had a strange dream last night involving him that has stayed on my mind throughout the day. Please keep in mind that I DO NOT think amorously about my brother in any way.      I dreamed that for some strange reason, people were giving me presents. I think perhaps it was my birthday or some other special occasion? At any rate, my brother hands me a striped blouse (I'm female, so the gift is appropriate ha ha) with a black belt that goes around my waist. I try to put it on, but the blouse would not fit. I sit down and tell him that his gift, although thoughtful and stylish, was not functional. Without speaking, he grabs me and cradles me in his arms, with an apologetic look on his face. I sit there completely stunned, and have no idea how or why he's doing such a thing.      someone help! This dream has been bothering me all day and I have made but little sense on what it could mean. I haven't seen him in months, not since Christmas vacation. I hope no one thinks I'm weird or incestuous or anything.       any guesses?

For example, if i believed someone was going to become great, good and an all-round decent character, wouldn't that person be restricted to that perception if they were to associate with me?      Furthermore, if i believed someone was going to amount to little, and become something of an asshole, wouldn't that person be restricted to that perception if they were to associate with me?      What about if i wasn't the only person who believed it?      What if i went about convincing people that certain individuals would not amount to anything?      Wouldn't that mean that society as a whole was becoming restricted?

20090225061849AArjgJ5	Social Science;Psychology	I had the most saddest and scariest dream I ever had?	WARNING: This will take 10-15min to finish reading      the whole world was getting strike by a huge and small rock from the sky, it was raining, we're trying to dodge rocks all morning then my grandmother said   "If you make it out tell everyone I'm sorry." I was scared about what she's gonna do. she lit herself on fire to get out of the torture of being scare. I told her "Don't do this!" then I put the fire out and she was still alive I said "I'll cover you!" she said "you sure?" I said "yes I'm sure." the small rock came down and went through my arm and I said "you see? I'm covering you!" She noticed what happened. She said "what time were you born" my Aunt said "3:06" my grandma said "it's a sign."   the sky clear up and there was no rock in the sky anymore but 15 min later it start to happened again.   I was in the front door thinking that it would be safe there. A guy with a Silver Ford Truck drove up to me and ask me "Do you need a ride!?"   I said "I'm with my family!" My grandma came to where I'm at and she said it would be okay. I notice another rocks falling from the sky   I said "look out!" He notice it then he drove quickly away then he hit into one of the ditch in the neighbor and flip his car but it flip back over then he drove around to get us.      I woke up at that part.      what do you think about this?

20090202102312AA4BhaH	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Does a man's income have anything to do with the attractiveness of his girlfriend/wife?	Basically, does the amount of money he makes determine his ability to attract attractive women (i.e. facially symmetrical, large eyes, curvy yet toned, under 33).   Social scientists have noted a correlation, but I want to hear the opinion of the common man (and women).   Also, do women make the decision consciously (opportunistic), or do they convince themselves that the spud with a large wallet is the their soul mate?  Now matter how rich a girl is, a guy can't justify that she's 'Mrs. Right'.  A hot girl who works at Burger King would attract him much more than an older unattractive heiress.

20090225053747AAU8qrV	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Girls, why should I get married, and what is expected from me?	My friend recently divorced, he was part of a 50/50 relationship... meaning he did half the house work, took care of the kid as much as the wife did etc. She no longer had feelings for him, and eventually he got tired of hanging on (I think that most people would cheat at this stage because they will too scared to let everything go, but he did things the right way). My question is, Why Should Men Get Married?      To me it seems that Men loose much more then women do. Besides our wife, we automatically loose most of our parenting rights - we literally have to beg to see the kids, we loose the house (and sometimes car) until the kids are grown up because they need a place to live in, we don't have as much support from our peers as women do, the courts do not favor us at all. Our life radically changes overnight, just because we got married! It's no wonder that divorced men have 6 times the chance of committing suicide .. divorced women suicide rates are not effected.      I'm not saying divorce is a walk over for women, loosing a partner is never easy. But to me, it seems like men are at a disadvantage when they get married. and the feminist "get divorced, and live happier" motivation surely does not help families, being materialistic and egoistic does not help either. Everyone seems to be lazy and gives up so easily, it does not seem like anyone even tries anymore!      My situation: 25 years old, I have a house and take care of myself, do not live with my girlfriend, have a good job and things are great. I want to have a kid in the future but I am re thinking marriage - I will love my kid to death like my father loved me. It will rip my heart out to loose my child.      My girlfriend had an unexpected pregnancy, I wanted to keep the baby and she did not. I am against abortion and had absolutely no say when I tried to keep my baby.      It's very easy to say if you love the person you will know when to get married etc, but marriage is a concept invented by the human race... Marriage is not that simple, the biggest factor that drives relationships into the wall nowadays is Money and less time. It's all good to say that love will fight everything, but I don't think that's completely realistic.I also think that not being able to live without someone is not healthy, whilst being able to live without and choosing to live with that person is the perfect balance - sometimes relationships must survive on respect when the passion and flames are gone.

20090225050337AAUuaGW	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	I might be having out-of-body experiences?	It started about 8 years ago, when I was sleeping. I used to wake up and be able to see around me, but not be able to move a muscle. It freaked me out at first, but after several occurrences through-out the years I've began to know what was happening and wait for it to subside.      Now, the medical term for it is sleep paralysis and it would be fine and dandy, except the story doesn't end end there.       I've started trying to move my limbs, but all I would see is a ghostly representation of my arm for example. I thought that was odd.       One time, I tried to get my 'soul' to travel outside of my body and I was met with resistance as if I was chained to my body. Then, I tried to get up from beside my body and I did but then my 'soul' crashed into the glass coffee table as if it was weak and then I 'woke up' to find it completely intact.      Now, I can see everything in the room. So I doubt I'm dreaming it. I can see where the clothes are, where things are out of place. So I do have some sort of recognition of what's happening outside.       My questions are these:      1. Have you had any similar experiences? If so, what happened with you or what did you accomplish.      2. Do you believe this is a hallucination? Or something similar?      3. If you believe me, what do you think I should attempt next?

20090225054407AAL1mhM	Social Science;Psychology	Can somebody please help: I suffer from social anxiety that is ruining my life?	I have been suffering from panic attacks, social anxiety and agoraphobia now for over a year, and for the past 6 months I have been trying to overcome them but finding it impossible. I first went to my doctor who recommended cognitive therapy which I agreed could work so I booked myself in and at the end of all the therapy sessions I was over my agoraphobia but not my panic attacks and social phobia, so I went back to my doctor who prescribed me citalopram as it was supposed to be good, I am now taking this once a day and although it has helped me somewhat it isn't dealing with the problem head on.   I now work 4 hours per evening but finding it really hard to socialize and remain calm at work, I get paranoid and anxious all the time, I cannot tell the difference between playful banter and general bullying but all I know is I get confused and I don't know how to behave, so I instead I tend to be quiet and try to fade into the background and I think people notice this so they target me more as they see me as weak, but if I stand up for myself they might see me as being weird as they could only be playing when I think they are being rude.   Aside from all that I stopped seeing all my old friends as they all took drugs so I have no friends, and I have never had a girlfriend and probably never will due to my social ineptness.   So here I am on the earth, a healthy 19 year old male, with no friends, not much of a life, no future wife and no hope, and not much of a life either.   Sorry to go on but life sucks and I cannot wait much longer for things to get better as it feels like I am soon going to run out of things that are going to help me.   I think my social anxiety could be being caused by something more serious such as asperges or some form of schizophrenia, but then I could just be overreacting, or suffering from hypochondria.   Any Help and Advice would be much Appreciated, Many thanks

I feel bad if someone looks at me and starts saying to themselves even “wow wish I could look like that” or “goodness she is so thin when will I be thin too” or “wow that is good story when will I be able to come up with idea’s like that” ….   Almost like if I didn’t dress that well or if I didn’t show how thin I was they wouldn’t of had that thought! Is it me being selfish thinking that’s what they are thinking?   Regardless because of this I don’t give my best, I don’t dress the best, I don’t do the best work, ect. Deep down inside I want to be the best(at least I think I do) guess I do care to much about what others Think but not say odd.   What do you think? Is there a name for what I’m feeling and doing? How does one go about fixing this I want to be the best dressed but I won’t any tips on how to convert me? to speak lol      Note: I use dress as the main example I feel most people can relate to!   this goes with everything I do! I won't do my best in fear of the same things.      How can you feel good about yourself by making others people jealous?      I just don't want to hurt anyone’s feelings if someone thinks I suck because i'm not giving 100% then so be it I could care less! at least they don't think they suck because of me!      could it be that I think very little of people who do that..( make people envy them) and I don't want to think that about myself!
20090203141719AAoVjQ1	Social Science;Psychology	HELP ME PLEASE – I have severe OCD – Obsessive Compulsive Disorder – PLEASE HELP ME ?	Clicking my ankles is where it all started. I forced them to click constantly for a few years and stopped only last week.  For the last year I’ve been forcing my knees to click also. I could only stop if I was satisfied to end them the way that I wanted where it feels right and evenly clicked. Now I’ve got them all even I’m never comfortable and I think about every move I make. Today I walked on the icy snow and slipped and because I didn’t walk the way I normally would I feel that I have to get all the clicks out of my knees and start over and have a fresh walk otherwise they would constantly feel wrong. I felt a lot more free and able to do things when I was clicking my knees and ankles as I knew that I still had to get them even etc.  I know that this must be hard for anyone to understand but I know what I mean and I can only start living once I’m satisfied. It’s so hard to explain. I don’t think that my OCD is like anyone else’s, only some things are. I feel that I can never be helped. I feel I can only help myself. I can’t explain it at all. I don’t know what to do

Employment Skills You Gain With a Liberal Arts Education    Women's studies provides you with all the benefits of a liberal arts degree.  Liberal arts education emphasizes critical thinking, which can be applied to a multitude of careers.  It demonstrates to a potential employer that you have the confidence, skills, and maturity to earn a college degree; that you are well-rounded, having studied a wide variety of topics rather than one narrow skill area; that you likely are able to think more globally than many other job applicants.  Managers often prefer liberal arts majors because they think they are better at organizing material, writing well, and making oral presentations.  Moreover, a Women's Studies major equips you with significant additional advantages...       B. Additional Employment Skills You Gain With a WS Degree    Larissa Semenuk, a Women's Studies graduate, explains:  "The major prepares one to do anything any other liberal arts major does but with deeper insight into issues of oppression and celebration of women.  Hopefully, this insight carries over into important issues of other groups -- making one more sensitive and therefore more prepared to do all things/jobs with greater attention to ethical standards.  A Women's Studies major is taught to look for the hidden -- like looking for the silenced voices of women in history.  It's invaluable!" (Luebke and Reilly 19).  There are many practical applications for Women's Studies training on the job.  For example, as more women work, business and corporations find the need for more sensitivity to women's issues such as sexual harassment, flex-time, parental leave, pay equity, and equal employment opportunities.  The development of women's agencies and organizations is spurring demand for graduates with specializations in Women's Studies.  There is growing demand in the professions of law, medicine, social work, teaching, counseling, and government service for expertise on gender issues.   Similarly, women's studies specialists are increasingly being used as consultants in industry, higher education, insurance companies, and personnel firms.  Perhaps most importantly, many Women's Studies graduates say that their education gave them the confidence to pursue careers traditionally held by men.       C. Fields of Graduate Study That WS Majors Have Pursued    The fields of graduate study that Women's Studies majors have pursued include:  Administration, advocacy, anthropology, arts, counseling, education, history, humanities, international studies, law, library science, philosophy, psychology, public health, public policy, social work, and sociology.       D. Fields of Employment WS Graduates Have Pursued, With Real Examples of Specific Job Placements Within Each Category    A recent national study uncovered more than 38 distinct occupations pursued by Women's Studies graduates (Luebke and Reilly).  Categories of careers include

I enjoy a simple life, with simple pleasures and few people around me. But this world and society has a different idea for how I must live my life... the fact that I am unable to live as simply as I want makes living not seem worth while at all.... but ill continue to search for that simple life I ever so long for....

20090203142343AATubmS	Social Science;Psychology	What should I think of my dream? ?	I had a strange dream, it was about death and all. Well, I asked death how I would die and death said, "You'll die with something sharp against your wrist, you can run away but you can't resist." and then the age of 29 kept coming to mind when he said that.    I had just been watching Final Destination 3 on tbs before I was asleep, so maybe it's just a dream. But it seemed so dark for just a dream. Do you think it could be the future? Because I can't get it off my mind. Haha.

20090225062932AATSP8l	Social Science;Psychology	What the hell should I do with my life?	I am a very talented person. I'm a musician, I'm very physically fit, I am also a free runner stuntman. I don't know whether to stick to music for the rest of my life. It seems to be all I really ever find true joy in, beside adrenaline rush experiences, which bring in thoughts of either joining the Special Forces or U.S. Navy SEALs. Something I've been wanting to do since after high school but have too much difficulty trying to commit to anything really.. I tried out college and it felt like I was wasting my time with emphasis. In all reality what I feel what is right is to just live off the land as the native Indians had. I feel like I have such a strong bond with nature, and I always socialize as if people don't really exist as they appear, but remain one entire being with only their subconscious mind being their own individual identity. It seems like the only good decisions I make are Life or Death situations. I know it's impossible to live the ancient ways because of the Government, and I know it's very rare to live off of music. I know that giving myself to authority is the last thing I'd ever do, but I also know that with the way society is these days, the Army or the Navy is most practical. There's just got to be another way.

20090203141448AA5UVCM	Social Science;Economics	Cross Price Elasticity of Demand?	I'm confused...help!! And write out how you get there too please, don't just give the answer.      Consider the following demand and supply relationships in the market for golf balls: Qd = 90-2P-2T and Qs = -9+5P-2.5R, where T is the price of titanium, a metal used to make golf clubs, and R is the price of rubber.      R = 2 and T = 10      I already figured:   Equilibrium price = 12    Quantity = 46   Price Elasticity of Demand = -.523   Price Elasticity of Supply = -1.304      So my question is:   At the equilibrium values, calculate the cross-price elasticity of demand for golf balls with respect to the price of titanium.

20090203150446AAkkDbo	Social Science;Psychology	How do I change my violent tendencies>?	I am going in for surgery on the 13th (Friday the 13th, yes I know) and I am worried about going under anesthesia.      I have had several surgeries in the past and I tend to have an adverse side affect to anesthesia. When I first start waking up I often become very violent. I am 20 years old and I have had 4 previous surgeries.      When I become violent I have absolutely no clue what I am doing. I am fully aware of what is going on and I remember it after the incidents but in the moment I feel so "out of it" that I have no control over myself.      The latest surgery I had I warned my doctor about it; as I have harmed nurses and doctors before, and he said that it was no problem and that it was common for people my age to be violent. So his remedy was to strap my arms, legs, and torso to the bed. Well, it really only intensified my anxiety. I had a full on panic attack on top of the violence and trying to get out of the restraints. I had bruises and cuts from the straps the next day.      This does really concern me and I am wondering if it is normal. It can be very traumatizing because I feel so awful for what I have done. I've broken a nurse's nose, and harmed doctors and myself in these fits of rage.      Is this normal? Why do I do this? Is there something I need to suggest to my physician that is being overlooked?

20090203142157AAgRrmR	Social Science;Psychology	Have any of you been bullied and if so, have the effects stayed with you?	I was bullied both mentally and physically when I was younger. I couldn't quite understand cos I was like 14 at the time and was kind of friends with the bullies and then I suppose the hormones kicked in and things turned nasty. One guy in particular started to make up rumours and naturally a lot of them believed him even tho they were enturely untrue. Anyway, I'm 22 now and I suppose the whole experience has left me well to put it simply pretty empty and the rest as I feel I missed out on a lot of opportunities at school to avoid the bullies and subsequently sold myself short. Im not sure I will ever really be the same person again. I also get really paranoid about people talking about me behind my back. Thankfully, I have grown about a foot and a few inches then so I am able to defend myself but at the time I felt completely helpless largely due to my tiny stature. Please share your opinions and experiences if you had them.
20090203122746AAECtKF	Social Science;Psychology	Moral/ethical question?	k now say these situations presented themselves, what would you do:       1) someone just mugged you and took ur wallet/purse. you had a gun and so you took it out as the mugger was running away (the key thing being that the mugger was running away from you when you took out the gun). would you shoot at him? say you knew that he would get away with the crime, would you shoot at him then?       2) same situation as above, but instead a man rapes you, then runs away, etc.. would you shoot him while he was running away? and again would you shoot him if you knew that he would get away with the crime?      3) say a small dog (like 20-30 lbs and he didnt reach your knee in height) attacked you and started biting. once again you had a gun. would you shoot it?         ps: dont just say oh id take aim and shoot him in the foot. pretend that emotions and adrenaline were pumping and you knew if you took a shot, you'd kill the person/dog
