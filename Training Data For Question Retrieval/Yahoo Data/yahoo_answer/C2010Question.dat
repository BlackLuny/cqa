I was going to set up a playlist, hook it to my tape player, and play it instead of a CD. But the Zune wouldn't start, so I set it on the charger.   We took it back to Wal-Mart, which told us the 2yr additional warranty is from the manufacturer, so we would have to send it off. And before we do that, we were supposed to call and ask for a box. Now, I put it on charge, hoping it will fix itself, and after about 10 minutes on charge, it shows that its charging, or a low battery. So was it just completely drained?

My speakers were plugged into a surge protector and everything else that was plugged into the surge protector came back on, except for my speakers.

20070719152158AAmm5yg	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Please Help! unlock my nokia 6030?	I have a nokia 6030 but the software that i have for generating unlock codes is probably a bit too old to calculate the correct code. I have nokia free unlock codes calculator V.3, which gives me codes but luckily it tells me that my mobile modle is the 5100 so i know that the codes won't be right. Other software i have tried is calculator by cybergsm V.2.7 and dct4 by cyberdog and hollowman. The last two dont tell me the model of phone that they have generated the codes for but because they are the same codes as that of the first calculator i know that they too must be wrong. Non of the programmes  ask for the phone model which i think is a bit dumb. If any one has actually unlocked the 6030 before or has any tips on how to unlock the newer nokia modles please help me. Also, i have not entered in any codes so i still have my five lives as so to speak. okay the info you will want is as follows:    Model: 6030   IMEI: 353929010480252   Country: Ireland   Provider: 02 (previously Esat)

It goes through the motions and "loads" up to five songs, and then gives me an error, the error code is always different, so I don't know what it could be.  It also does not hold a charge, so could the whole problem be that the battery is dead?  The ipod itself is pretty old, I think I got it about 2 years ago, when they were the newest ones out.

I just found my Firewire cable and connected my iPod to a power source...  I cannot connect my iPod to my laptop since I lost my USB cable...  The ipod has about 3 band discographies worth of music... Social Distortion, Muse, and From Autumn to Ashes, but when I play them... They take forever to load up and also only play about 3 seconds of the song and goes to the next... It is pretty frustrating...  And if this would help get a solid answer, my ipod is about 2-3 years old, it is a 4G 20 gig b/w and was bought when it was one of the newer models.  Please give me an answer that does not include the hard drive being dead...  If that is the case, I am tossing apple into the trash where they belong, this ipod has never been dropped, banged around, tossed around or anything that would damage it... and I will be ticked beyond belief if there is no other solution...

I am wondering how much 8 GB memory is? How many hours or minutes or songs or whatever can it hold?    I'm not going to be using it for pictures or videos...will that give me more storage space for songs?     Also, like some mp3's I've heard of, do they have the option to stick in another memory card for more storage?    Is it reliable? So far from all of the reviews it sounds perty good...and its in my price range :)       Let me know, and if you have anything to add (good or bad) please share it with me!          thanks

20081108100412AAGUJkB	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	My Xbox 360 keeps freezing!?	I bought my xbox 360 used a couple of months ago. It has worked fine up until now. First I thought my halo disk was scratched because it seemed to only start freezing when i was playing halo (granted, i don't play much else). Then my friend brought over his copy, and the same thing happened. Next, I thought it had something to do with my NAT type on xbox live, since it would always freeze when I was playing online. But I again was proved wrong because I popped in a copy of ncaa 09, and it froze up when I was playing offline. It usually lets me play for about 20 min before freezing, and there are no strange lights or anything...the screen just freezes.       I recently switched from keeping it sitting vertically, to laying it down horizontally...could that be the problem(I have it elevated off the ground)      Does anyone know if microsoft will fix a used xbox360? Can they tell its used?

This has happened somewhere near the following times:  the very first game i played that day, after 3-5 games, and after 10 games.  take note that it only happens once per sitting, like if it happens the first game, then it doesn't do it again until i turn off the xbox and come back to it later.      The problem is not in the disc as i have tried multiple discs in its place, all coming up with the same results.      The sound problem is not in the tv as i can switch channel and have volume, and the problem isn't in the cables as i am not touching the cables in between times when it works and when it doesn't work.  I have double checked the cables when there was no sound also.      Could it be overheating or something?

The thing is, I'm going to college and that dvd player is my parents... I want to know if anyone has any good suggestions for a dvd player like the one that doesn't skip.  It would also be nice if it is cheap.  I guess I'm asking, what is the optimal dvd player that I can get for the lowest price.
