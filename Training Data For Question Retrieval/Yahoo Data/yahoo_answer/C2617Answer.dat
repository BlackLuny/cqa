Hate to break it to ya, but I only charge $45.00 for a fully functional key for that vehicle.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	I paid $60 at my dealer in NJ for a duplicate for our 2002 CR-V|`|I2zmz3Ixaa	I dont know how big of a city you live in but in my area we have multiple dealers.I do know that one dealer in my area has the ability to copy your keys immobilizer code with the same machine they cut it with. That is all done in the parts dept .and you dont get stiffed a fat labor charge from the service dept. for something they shouldnt charge you if you buy the key there!If i were you I would check around to other dealers and see if anyone offers this device! You still may have to buy the key there but it wont cost you $100.00!GOOD LUCK|`|OSYxKO5Caa	Well you can send me your original and the one you bought online and I will galdy clone it for  you.......Which means i will porgram the one you bought online just pay postage both ways,,,,,and if you want a 3rd key I can add it for only $25.00 xtra<br>  <br>  www.IselaHernandez.com

EjTikPNcaa	The most common problem, based on your concern, is the crankshaft position sensor.  It is the sensor that controls the spark for ignition.<br>  <br>  The part is relatively inexpensive at $45.00 OE from Hyundai but the size of the engine you have will make the difference in labor to replace it.<br>  <br>  4 cyl = 3.0 hours labor (multiply by the shop's hourly rate.  ie. $65.00/ hour X 3 = $195.00<br>  The sensor on the 2.4L is under the timing cover.  Basically the timing belt and drive belts and many other parts have to come off before you can even get to the sensor.<br>  <br>  6 cyl = 0.5 hours labor ($65.00 X .5 = $32.50)<br>  The sensor on the 2.7L  & 3.5L is near the starter on the side of the cylinder block.  It looks like a simple black wiring harness, about 7 inches long.  It is attached to the block with a single bolt and the other end plugs into the main wiring.  The starter has to come off and the sensor just drops into a recessed hole in the block.<br>  <br>  Is your check engine light on?  If not, your Hyundai dealer can still hook up to the computer and look for trouble codes.  98% of engine electrical problems will throw a code.  Have your dealer diagnose and in many cases, they will incorporate the cost of it into the price of repair if you have them do it.
FFUpnfq4aa	yes i had this problem guys on here tell me how good they are but i couldnt keep a trans in it my truck burned out trans and couldn't get the next one to work right either i've spoken to others with the same issues<br>  and whats worse it cost me like $2000 for a rebuild and it didn't last<br>  there is an issue here with a solenoid they say but i changed mine<br>  (trans shop)and it went bad anyway feel sorry for ya|`|8ifKojOXaa	Is the transmission filter and fluid fairly new in it?I think you should call up the dealership and ask them if any transmission comp reprogramming is available or if they have what they call a flash update for it.The transmission may have slight shifting issues due to the fluid or filter or the transmission comp=TCM is acting up.<br>   If someone has disconnected the battery while working on it both those times that might be why it seemed okay but once it starts to relearn it acts up all over again.<br>   It might be worth while to change the filter and fluid on it if it's not been done lately , plus getting it flashed and put into the learning mode might help it quite a bit too.<br>   You could also try going to a big do it yourself auto wreckers and buying a TCM like yours and trying it in there awhile to see what it does but it's best once you replace it to have it put into the learning mode by a dealership or transmission shop and if that doesn't work it might really need to be flashed.Flashing cost about 60 bucks plus tax and the work usually has to be pre-booked.<br>  <br>   Hope that helps and best of luck.By the way engineering updates come out for such problems and thats one reason they require flashing done.<br>   Little note you might want to call up a dealership and ask then if and when exactly the flash update came out ,plus ask them for the price of a TCM for that exact yr and model and the price of the exact same part on a newer model too bec that tell you if you could use a newer TCM from the wreckers that might have the flash update already in it.<br>   Be sure to take a TCM out of a vehicle with the same engine and transmission in it and they run about 30 to 75 bucks if you pull one out yourself. I'm not postive but I believe that it should be a 60 pin TCM comp that either is mounted on the left firewall upfront or it's on the firewall on the left side just below the dash under the hood.<br>   You may want to add some brand new ground wires to the TCM 60 pin connections bec that could be part of your problem and Dodge uses quite thin wiring in alot of their comp wiring circuits so keep that in mind too.

GtazNrplaa	Here in Australia the suspended licensed driver is automatically charged with traffic offences and if the car that that this person is driving is insured by this person then you claim against that insurance cover is claimable under third party. If you are injured then there is the registration third party insurance which is managed by the State the car is registered in and your injuries are covered under that insurance. However you are in America so I don't know who your laws work. Best of luck and hope you are not injured Penny Darling.|`|qWqg7vFJaa	Get legal advice as soon as possible Penny..<br>  If he is suspended I would have doubts about the validity of his insurance..Thats how it works over here..|`|QEqGukjZaa	yeah you can sue..definitely!|`|LpZXuTVCaa	I pray that you are not the one who is injured.|`|QgHOMADZaa	then the suspended driver would face citations from the police for driving while suspended but the insurance would still have to pay.

r1D9P4Vyaa	You did not say what make,model and year car you have but today`s newer cars have two lower ball joints, one on each side. they are not to bad to do in the garage at home. And Moog is a good name brand. As far as the "front suspension" that is what they will be going on. Part of the front suspension. It is good that you want to learn more about cars, I like that. I hope this will help to answer your question. Good Luck.  :^)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	hi sunshine ! the suspension is where your steering is at in the front. it includes the tie rods, ball joints, control arms, struts and the rack and pinion.everytime you turn the steering it moves the tie rods which turns the wheels right or left. moog would be your better buy and as long as the other side is tight then all you have to do is change the bad side. to change the ball joint you need a floor jack, wrenches, a pickle fork to separate the ball joint and a hammer. if it,s the original joint then the rivets will have to be cut out unless it,s pressed into the control arm, which i don,t think it is.|`|Gn0nR2S1aa	What type of vehicle? Year? other info would help.<br>  <br>  Now that i know the car i can say from experience the sable/taurus of that era commonly have squeaky front suspension ball joints, and tie rod ends. Special tools for the most part are not required, but in turn, ball joints are not a simple job to do at home for the un knowing. The other thing is that a wheel alignment would need to be done.|`|AA10736285	Why were the ball joints condemned?<br>  <br>  Your vehicle don't generally need ball joints unless it been through some rough service|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	There are Upper and Lower Ball Joints also the 2 bolts that hold<br>  the Steering Knuckle one is camed ,meaning it is not round it sets the wheel in or out;Before You remove or disturb Bolts take a Permanent marker ,I use Type White out it makes a good mark and will stay on mark across head of bolt and the strut;<br>  <br>  There is a Ball joint Separator It is forked shape hit with hammer to separate, The Bottom one is tricky Block and secure the Bottom fork because it will drop when you remove the Ball Joint Nut;Do not take the Castlated Nuts completed off leave nuts at a the flush location until the Ball joint comes loose then You can finish removing Nuts;The New Bottom is Pressed in,Auto-Zone has the Hand Held Ram with the differant size adapter, Do not try to drive bottom one in with hammer and keep press tool on the outer edge;You will not damage the new ball joint by doing this:Oh Yes the Old Bottom  ball joint has to be pressed out.Auto-Zone doesn"t charge for tool rental;You will need to have Front Alignment done when You finish;Good Luck oh I forgot leave the Boyfriend out,don"t forget to Grease the new ball joints|`|HFrsH9MRaa	You are doing the right thing by using the "moog" parts, they are better and last longer. In order for your front wheels to turn, there is a ball joint on the lower control arm. The upper turning is provided by a strut bearing. As the ball joint wears (it is a ball and socket joint, like your hip) it loosens, causing a little shimmy, and eventually can separate and your wheels will collapse outward. This is worst case scenario. Have your technician evaluate the tie rod ends. These items usually wear out first. They also involve wheel turning. They connect your steering rack to the wheel hub. Good Luck!!!

However, at lease-end your car might possibly be worth more than the lease-end purchase price in your contract - because it will have fewer than expected miles. In that case, you could trade it or buy it and keep driving it or sell it for a profit. About late April or May you should check kbb.com to find out the value of your car, then compare that to the lease-end purchase price in your contract.|`|ojxfzv7Faa	No, you can't. I see many with the problem of being way over the mileage limit, but very, very few with problems being way under.|`|AA10788612	Nope. You made a contract & they will appreciate you bringing back the car so well maintained. Now they can stick it on the used lot & ask a mint for it. You did them a real favor by doing that.

And the REM wire doesnt have to be huge, all it carries is a signal that tells the amp to turn on.|`|exYJISb3aa	No, keep the remote wire the same, it don't have anything to do with power supply.  All the remote wire does is tell the amp to turn on.  Keep it small like 16 or 18 gauge, whatever you have keep it.

AA12095978	the 102" whip is probably the best antenna u can use.  it's simple and easy and doesn't need tuning.<br>  <br>  running dual antenna's would help, however if you don't have a long ground plane, like a semi-truck with trailer, 2 antennas that close together will snuff each other out and you won't get the results you're looking for.  it's like both signals will broadcast simultaneously and fight to see who's going to transmit first.<br>  <br>  if you have duals on a long semi truck, the body of the truck is a ground plane, you will be able to transmit much cleanly and the antenna's won't interrupt each other.<br>  <br>  stick with the coax you're using.

I would buy an aftermarket transmission. 5 of my ford trucks went through transmissions last year, yeah not good.|`|cbe5edb61dd87967b84240eeea031d0aaa	The best tranny to get is one from Ford.  I know they are a bit more pricey but well worth the money if you can afford it and if you are going to keep the vehicle for a long time.  It is the best way to go for several reasons, no matter who installs the trans, it comes with a 3 year warranty good at any Ford dealership in the USA. Including parts and labor, the other thing is, Ford found a particular issue with those transmissions they upgrade the repair so that kind of failure does not occur again where as a local trans shop will just do a rebuild not knowing about any updates on special repairs that might need performed
HE23qtamaa	If you can afford it, go new and get a good deal on it. Everybody says new cars depreciated as soon as you buy them, but that's assuming you pay RRP. If the car would depreciated 20% as soon as you buy it, but you get a 20% discount on the RRP then you're minimizing deprecation hit, especially when, in a few years, the market has recovered and new cars are more expensive - then your car may hold it's value well on the used car market. Also, it depends on the type of car and how well you take care of it. Cars that are very fuel efficient (but not hybrid) are holding their value well when being re-sold. Do your research, but don't overspend no matter how good a deal it is.|`|AA10788612	It just depends on the car. Many places are offering employee pricing & rebates & low apr's. But irregardless, are you needing a car at this very moment or do you just want one? You need to do a mountain of research. But look at what you need vs. what you want. We all want cool cars, but I have found those are the ones that you can get you into trouble. So think practicality. If you should happen to find a used car that is to you a real bargain, then go for it provided it is being sold at a reputable dealer that will honor repairs/warranty, etc... A certified used Honda from a Honda is an example. But new or used, you needs & finances should dictate what route to take.|`|tfC8BQXOaa	I have never bought a new car  in my life! lol. <br>  But I did buy a few foreclosed homes :)|`|GHd84xipaa	you really should go new.the dealers are really working with consumer on prices and there are some really good deals out there.i would go car shopping and see who has the best deal.|`|aa9gieAIaa	the only real advantage of newer cars is the luxury and any warranty you might get. a 90s vintage car is really the same as a new one for the most part. similar engine/drivetrain/suspension design. and many new ones don't even get as good milage as older ones. there are some other reasons newer is better but cars haven't changed all that much over the past 20 years. trouble is if you buy a used one with miles on it you might need to fix it up of course which is a bigger deal for some people than others. i don't mind keeping on top of maintenance so i drive a 90 ford probe with 140k. ive spent about 1500$ total on it including purchases cost and cost of new parts ive replaced. gets over 30 mpg and is made to last. what works for me isn't necessarily right for you of course.
abnqs0jQaa	A good buy, perhaps not as good as that of the American counterparts. A better buy, I would say yes. I picked up a SAAB 9-5 (yes, I know they are technically owned by GM, though not for much longer) a few weeks back and it had significant discounts on it as did the Volvos on the lot. <br>  <br>  A lot of companies are struggling to get rid of their 2008 vehicles, and hence are discounting them to move them off the lots and make room for 2008's. In Australia, there was even a brand who wasn't shipping their 2009 vehicles until more of the 2008s were sold, so dealers are stuck with some old stock that they want to get rid of ASAP.<br>  <br>  Assuming you have good credit and can afford a decent down payment, you probably can get an ok deal on a BMW right now.|`|a0565811de871e19a5c2a7b27aeadf50aa	All major world economies are feeling the effects of recession - including Germany!<br>  <br>  BMW has not cut prices, but they have several pretty good incentives going on at the moment - reduced interest rates, and a couple of months of car payments they will make for buyers - if you finance through them.|`|710TUKsUaa	i dont think it would because there country is not in a recession so they wouldn't take a price cut if they can get full price elsewhere|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	It's great if you can afford to buy a car.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you are like every other poster who asks if there is a cooling off period to return a car because they bought more than they could handle.<br>  <br>  Don't do that.|`|fiuMwrHHaa	Volvo Is Having A Good Deal On Their Cars <br>  You Could Probably Get a 2008/2009 S60/s40 For Around 22k

HFrsH9MRaa	Read your owner's manual 3-4 times. Make sure that the timing belt is changed on time. Also, use synthetic oil, if you have not already. It keeps the insides of your engine cleaner, and protects the best. Your engine seals will last longest. You will save money in the long run, since you only need to change it once a year. Also, remove the factory spark plugs, and use either Bosch Platinum or Nippondenso Iridium plugs. The pay-off is REAL. Your exhaust system will last longer and the engine will perform better. The reason is that the fuel will burn more efficiently. Your emissions will drop, and the power will go up. Power wash your engine once or twice a year, especially the space between the radiator and the A/C condenser. Road debris always collects here and restricts the flow or air around your radiator. Only use genuine MOPAR coolant. Don't listen to anyone that tells you there is a universal coolant. Have your brake fluid changed. This is the best way to promote expensive brake health. It will prolong brake component life. Read your owner's manual, again!! Use genuine MOPAR brake fluid!!

Basically the better your "GPA" for lack of a better term, the higher up you are in the rankings-these rankings are sometimes differentiated by half a point or so-competition's that fierce (but friendly).<br>  - Again through out the phases of SUPT up to this point, your Flight Commander, Primary Instructors, and other instructors are assessing you.  Their recommendations also factor into where you end up.  For instance you could have the best academic scores, but if the consensus is you don't have the hands for fighters-you ain't going to fighters.<br>  Your Flight Commander crunches the numbers, and ranks your class.  He/she will call you in to give you your class ranking and get an idea of your preferences-and what your odds are of getting the track you want.  ("Tracks" are the specialized part of SUPT= you may go to Fighter/Bomber, C130, Heavies or Helos.)<br>  On "Track Night" AKA "Assignment Night", you find out how you did.  Typically for a class of 25-30 students you MIGHT see 1-2 fighters come down, a couple bombers the rest heavies, C130s and helos.  That means 4 students are going to Fighter/Bomber and rest to something else.<br>  So if you are ranked in the top 4, congratulations you're still in the running for a fighter.  If you aren't, but are close, say numbers 5-8 it's going to depend on what the students ranked ahead of you choose.  <br>  It still gets a little more complicated:  Say you really want a Viper, you put down as your first choice.  One shows up, but NO ONE ranked above you put it down as their 1st choice-you get the Viper and are off to Fighter/Bomber track.  In this scenario if you're ranked at below 8-it ain't gonna happen.

Cons are high center of gravity roll over danger. Not so good fuel economy  13 to 21 miles a gallon 4x4  17 to 21 mpg 2 wheel drive. Plastic parts inside seem kind of cheep 2000 to 2004.  in 2005 major improvements were made Xterria made Motor Trends 4x4 of the year.

exYJISb3aa	I really don't think you should do 2 separate boxes one ported and one sealed.  It's just not correct, but wait for other peoples responses.  They'll be tuned to different frequencies.<br>  <br>  These calculations are based off of one sub. so multiply it these numbers x 4.  This is recommended from the factory.<br>  <br>  Sealed Box Volume 1.00 - 2.00 cubic feet<br>  Ported Box Volume 1.25 - 1.75 cubic feet|`|uL5772kCaa	No on different boxes. You can cause cancellation and it will actually sound worse than if you just put them all in the same box. What you can do is create 2 sealed, or 2 ported boxes, but they have to be the exact same specs.<br>  <br>  Sealed will run you about 4 cu ft. while ported you will need about 10 cu ft since you need space for the port and stuff...
CCez4vK0aa	you have a bad turn signal flasher which is Integrated with your hazard  flasher on your dash. GM had a recall on the flasher.should be free if you bought the car new. check with your local dealer.

pAYx91XJaa	Let me give you a got hint and lets start from the small body style.<br>  <br>  Mercedes W124. One of mercedes best selling cars ever. Very good engines and transmissions.Also those cars have a lot of potential  (headlights, taillights, rims, springs and much more). However you can't do a lot with their engines to make it very fast. Still if you want to buy the top of the line and the best one ever build in this class, look for the 500E. This car was limited on the production line, made by mercedes benz and porsche with a 5.0L engine that produce 326 horsepower and its sexy exterior and never forget the fully loaded interior options.<br>  <br>  Mercedes w126 (560sec) its a great car with beautiful interior and quite engine.Its a very special and good looking car and if u want to see beautiful once try mercedes club and they will just take you away with there beauty. But as u said its hard to find one with low miles those days. also its not that good on gas.<br>  <br>  Mercedes w140. Unlike any other, The top of the top. Its a tank. Very smooth and quite engine, . 96 and up came 5 speed transmission and Straight ignition coil. Good on gas. Huge interior space and dont forget, this car windows are double glass for quite and smoother ride. Also this car have a lot of potential. you can be driving on the freeway on 100miles per hour and you wont feel it .S320 is good and smooth but not as powerful and smooth as the s420 nor s500. go for the V8 that car needs it because of its heavy weight. But keep it in mind its expensive when it comes to maintenance.<br>  <br>  Take your time and shop around for the best deal. Always go for the lower mileage and best interior.|`|4b4d4f3bfe33461a02daa163629ada22aa	Suggest you inquire at your insurance company, how much is the insurance premium on each of the cars you are interested in purchasing?  The answer to the question may lead you to the correct choice in your next MBz purchase. Have you thought about a CPO purchase through your MBz dealer?|`|bqLvWpcZaa	The W124 is the most reliable of the 3.  The W126 and W140 were the most luxurious Benz vehicles of their time and as such, have the most features and options ( especially the W140 chassis vehicles...Benz made the W140 S-Class the electronics and technology showcase vehicle of its time ).  While those features can be nice, they also make repairs more expensive when something goes wrong.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	I would look into a C class or an E class. $15K can get you a car from the late 90s or early 2000s. They are also better looking (in my opinion) and have much better handling and amazing features. In '97 the E class body style changed so its more modern, and in '01 the C class body changed to look very streamlined and its also a little bigger.<br>  <br>  I have a C230 Kompressor and it is an amazing car.... seats 5 comfortably, low insurance, decent gas mileage and very low key (never get tickets or pulled over). It also has a lot of really cool features in it!<br>  <br>  Try to buy a car that has a warranty because MBZ repairs and maintenance are very expensive!
YJVmL9Ubaa	Just a quart?Seriously don't even worry about it,with that many miles it probably needs 10/30 anyway.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it will be just fine. it will mix with the other oil. it won,t hurt nothing.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	The "w" in the formula is the big concern here. It stands for winter. Your engine calls for 5W oil, which is thinner in the cold weather, but provides adequate flow. If this were my car, I would change the oil, but I would use Mobil One 0W-30. It simply provides the best protection in all temperatures, and flows even better. Plus, it will continue to clean out the inside of your engine as you drive, and WILL increase gas mileage and power. It only needs to be changed once a year, unless you have a lot of engine sludge. You will be amazed at how much better your engine will run on this special oil. And, you will svae $$$ in the long run. Good Luck!!!|`|aa9gieAIaa	if you have 160k you might want 10-40 any ways its not that big a deal seriously. too thick of oil is not desirable but not worth sweating about it. your mix of two viscosities will be closer to what was already in there anyways.|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	You'll be all right, but please put the 5w-30 back in it when you next change your oil.|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	You will be Fine,enjoy the Trip:|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	You'll be fine.|`|ooTfG1e9aa	In my opinion, I would say you have nothing to worry about. With that mileage on the engine, a thicker oil should not harm anything (I personally recommend 10w30 oil for those older engines). Besides, the 10w40 quart you added will mix with the oil already in the engine and result in a 10w33 weight.|`|8duiF4YZaa	YOU ARE FINE, NOT A PROBLEM|`|X6C6kZKKaa	it is ok to go.  the thicker the better.|`|6Zflv6cpaa	if you only added 1 qt. idon't think you'll have a problem one qt. won't convert the rest of the oil to40 w|`|LGJgs1XRaa	ull be fine just dont do it to often but once wont matter its just not that amazing for the engine

I would check Kelly Blue Book to see if the price corresponds with that mileage. I did that for our car. It was only 10 years old and had 114,000 which was a little high, so we were able to take some off the price. It has 124,000 on it now and the car is about 12 years old. I hope that helps.|`|J0Ie3XJmaa	120,000 miles is not too much if the car has been taken care of.

One crappy kick to the gut for VW quality.

I think the newest ones are better, but I can’t confirm that. <br>  <br>  As for the MkV Jetta and B6 Passats, it’s really way too early to tell concretely whether VW has truly improved on them or not.

One was an 89 Passat GLX and the other was a 01 Jetta GLX. Both of the cars ran flawlessly. I loved my Jetta and the Passat and I think I’m going to get a new Passat next year. The only complaint that I would have had was that on my Jetta the center caps were plastic and the VW emblem kept pealing every 6 months to a year. However, each time I would say something about it to the dealer, they replaced them for free, even when it was out of warranty. I believe one of the reasons car manufactures get a bad rap is because of the experience with the dealers. Especially with the American carmakers, the dealers experience can make or break what you feel about the car..<br>  <br>  By Derrick LS on Nov 15, 2006 | Reply<br>  <br>  I have an 05 Jetta and it has run without incident for 2 years, so not sure where they got that information!

IruoukkPaa	Its totally okay not to drive when you're sixteen.  I didn't get my license until after I turned 17.  My best friend didn't get his license until after he turned 18.  <br>  <br>  If you wait until after you turn 18, in the state of MI, I don't believe you have to take Drivers Ed--you can save money and just take the written and driving test.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and don't feel bad! :)|`|uFQFRdczaa	It entirely depends where you are.  In a lot of rural communities, it's normal to start driving at 16 (or younger) because anything a teenager might want to do is a 40 minute drive, and it's more convenient for parents to give their kid a crummy car than to ferry them in to town for a soda.  Or to send the kid to the store so they don't have to go themselves.<br>  <br>  In more urban areas, where adults can and do function without cars, kids tend not to get cars until 18 if at all.  I recently made a trip to Nashville (the #35 city in America) and couldn't find a parking space within 5 blocks of my destination.  For people who live downtown in cities that big and larger, a car would be more of a liability than an asset.  If I had to live there, no way my kids would get cars.|`|PizXrl2oaa	Nothing wrong with waiting..  My cousin just didn't want to drive and didn't even care to get a car until she turned 18.

bMW1u8DSaa	Renting a car just to take a test can be expensive. You would be better off going back and practicing more in the Grand Am and learning the car. Using a car you don't know will only make you do worse. You won't know the controls, you won't know the blind spots very well, you won't know how touchy it is. You don't know anything about the car. It's better to practice more than to spend money to get a car you don't know. You will do worse.
OQYsPw1zaa	the mileage isnt an issue,  test drive it, listen for a clicking or clunking noise from the front wheels, if you hear that noise its probably a bad cv axle ($200-$400) for repairs. Ask when the timing belt was changed.  If they dont know when you'll want to replace that before too long ($700) to replaced, although if it breaks not only will you be stranded but the engine will more than likely be shot after that, check the tread on the tires, is the exhaust loud, how bad is the rust on the rear fenders (common spot for rust on honda)  and does the engine sound smooth or does it run rough or make a ticking noise.   it could be a deal, but it could also be a nightmare if it has a lot of problems|`|I2zmz3Ixaa	I love owning HONDA and I work on them everyday!You may want to consider getting it looked at by someone who has some knowledge on cars cause even a average condition or less honda with that mileage brings more than $500.00 unless it has some issues!

My question to you is what is the engine size of your chevy pickup.  A six cylinder or eight cylinder makes a lot of difference when it comes to liters.  WHat is the axle ratio of the pickup.  Does it have a two or four barrel carb or is it fuel injected.  That affects gas mileage.

It'll probably drain way faster if you have a ground on it, grounded to a piece of metal.
PAceoX2oaa	Remove the parking light socket. There should be two wires going into where the bulb pops in. One should be a black wire, one should be red (or another color). Generally, red is power and black is ground. <br>  <br>  Your Halo lights should also have two wires coming out of them: one black and one of another color (red, white, whatever). Using a wire-cutter, cut both wires on the parking light socket. Make sure there's enough slack on both ends. Strip both ends of each wire you just cut. Strip the wire ends of the halo light wires. <br>  <br>  Using a cylindrical wire crimp connector of the appropriate size (red usually works well) twist one of the black parking light wires with the black halo light wire. So now you should have two wires connected with one common stripped end. Put that end in one end of the connector. Put the other single black wire end from the parking lights in the other end of the connector. Crimp down hard on both ends. Do the same for the power wires. Test your connections. Then do it for the other side.

Get the divorce now.|`|AA10720479	There are 3 things that never should be denied to a man, a dog, sex, and a motorcycle. Don't buy one and hide it. You need to talk to her. Motorcycles are cheaper to maintain, and get better mileage than cars. What's her argument for not getting one? If it's because you've been in several accidents, or have many speeding tickets, maybe you shouldn't get one.<br>  <br>  P.S. I don't like making pies, I like to ride. LOL|`|E0j6mhqhaa	Hmm164 has some good advice and no, I wouldn't buy one behind her back.  I guess there's several possibilities, one being that this is another one of your hair brained schemes she know will pass in a few weeks but payments you'll be stuck with for years.  <br>  <br>  Of course there's also the old "It's not safe, you'll kill yourself and leave your kids orphans" argument.  I guess that's a possibility, but she could get herself trampled and killed at the next Wal Mart Black Friday sale just as easily and leave the kids orphans.<br>  <br>  My brother's friend bought a new Harley, something his wife wasn't very happy about.  Guess what, after he gave her a few rides on it, she loves it and now she's the one suggesting they drop the kids off at grandma's and go for an evening bike ride.  They both say it's the best thing they've ever done for their marriage.  He farms, she's a hairdresser and after a long hard day, just the two of them going out for an hour's ride gives them a chance to relax and reconnect.|`|fbxqLErlaa	All that are proposing is a very bad idea.  <br>  First thing I would do is take the Motorcycle Safety Foundation rider course.  Tell the Mrs. that this is good training and an education.  You will have a great time at the school.  <br>  Second, while you are at the course, talk to the instructors regarding good beginner motorcycles.  I will guarantee they will NOT recommend a sport bike.  A motorcycle that goes from idle to 12,000 to 14,000 rpms and produces 150 plus horsepower in a quarter turn of the wrist is not what a beginner needs.  <br>  After the course, do your research.  Look at the total costs of ownership.  Purchase price, registration, plates, excise taxes, insurance, and safety gear. Good riding gear can set you back up to $1,000 to $1,500.  <br>  This exercise alone may cause you to reconsider a motorcycle.  <br>  DO NOT do this behind your Wife's back.  This is not good for trust in a marriage.  If you get hurt in an accident and are out of work, what kind of strain will that put on your marriage?|`|8GDBr2U9aa	Get rid of the wife and get the bike.

Alot depends on what kind of riding you are going to do and how much you are willing to pay if you lay one down.  Best to take the course and see what's out there before you buy.  Personally I would recommend a dual sport and have you do alot of off road before doing street riding, you can learn alot riding in the dirt.|`|AA12076385	This isn't a motorcycle question, it's a relationships question.<br>  <br>  That said, you're the man of the house and you make the decisions.

You'd be better off being truthful with your wife if you want your marriage to work. When I bought mine my wife was against it also.

I would strongly suggest you not purchase a motorcycle if your wife is against it. Do not purchase one and "hide it" and make a payment in secrecy. If you do you have taken serious steps on your way to divorce and you are the problem. A marriage is something two people work on not just disregard the other's  opinion. You should honor your wife by listening to her opinion. A motorcycle is a "want" and not a need. So your statement is you can't have what you want so you will get it anyway. That is not very mature thinking especially for a married man.<br>  <br>  You should be sharing your finances with your wife so she is aware of where the money is going. If you have the money to pay for a motorcycle in secret then you are indicating you are not honest at this time with your wife with your finances. So you are obviously willing to lie to her over a motorcycle. Why did you marry her then? <br>  <br>  An adulterer is one who cheats on their spouse. Sounds like you are planning on cheating but you just want the support of your behavior from unknown people via the internet.<br>  <br>  I suggest you take her for a ride on a motorcycle. She may surprise you and like it and be receptive to the idea of purchasing one. One of my daughters rides a motorcycle (races snowmobiles too) with her husband. <br>  <br>  Don't give up hope of ever obtaining a motorcycle. Now might not be the best time. If you got one now against her wishes and got hurt, she could say "I told you so." If she agreed to purchase one and you got hurt she wouldn't be able to say that as she was in agreement with the purchase. The secret to a long marriage is to get the spouse to go along with the program - means you have to go along with her plans sometimes too. That kind of thing makes women happy which is what a husband is supposed to do. When women are happy, men tend to be happy too.|`|DRwxJBrFaa	If you are married, you'll need to come to some sort of agreement on this and reach a peaceful resolution!!  Doing it in secrecy is NOT the way to go.  That is disrespectful for one, and will only lead to larger problems!!  be honest and up front!  <br>  Tell her you'll take the motorcycle safetly course and always wear your helmet and safety gear, and be careful.  Do some research on the statistics and emphisize on the GOOD!  Be a "salesman" - if you go behind her back, she WILL find out!!  and you WILL end up in trouble and she WILL say "I told you so!!!"<br>  <br>  If you do talk her into it.... I'd def say a 600cc yamaha or honda - th esmaller the motor, the cheaper on insurance also.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	Your wife won't *let* you?  Is she giving you the "they aren't safe" argument or something?<br>  <br>  I don't think it's a good idea to buy one anyway and then hide it from her.  One would think that she would find out eventually.  Maybe you should put your foot down and tell her you're buying one.  What's she going to do, divorce you?  Not likely.  She'll be upset and then she'll get over it.  If she doesn't, then she needs more things to worry about or something.|`|LSWhtF1Paa	Make her get some benefit out of it. We got my fiance a new car in October of 07 so she couldn't make much of an argument when I told her I was going to get a new Harley for my birthday. She got a little but pissed on a few occasions but that's when I just walked out and jumped on my new machine. Maybe you could redo a room in the house for her, or the kitchen. Wives seem to like those things.|`|jFwuiRKxaa	Hiding it is not a good  idea just makes it worse when she finds out. I had a wife that gave me a choice her or the bike.

43MRQ9eLaa	go for it... why not... you would still have 2000 left over then put that 400 a month away in the bank and save up for somthin good...<br>  <br>  but i would pay off the car and then spend the 2000 left over on modifications..|`|3MTYGEbWaa	I don't think you should tie up all your money in the car. First, because the car depreciates in value, much of your money will disappear and you can't get it out if you need it. Second, you'll do better by investing the $16,000 and making money, rather than losing it in depreciation. Cars are not good investments or places to sink money that you might need later. Sure, you pay interest on the loan, but it's a worthwhile cost if it keeps your money liquid so that you can get if you need it in an emergency. There's a benefit to using other peoples' money. Rich people know that. It's how they got rich.|`|tlue10gAaa	Sounds like you are in a lot better shape than a lot of people. Good for you.  I would not completely pay off the car. You should have 3-6 months of living expenses set aside as "an emergency fund" for when your refrigerator or furnace need replacing. Notice I didn't say if but when. Then you should have more savings. Sounds like you are disciplined enough to get-r-done so I would recommend you pay more than you have to on the car to get it paid off early. After you get the car paid for, keep making the $400 monthly payment to a savings account for your next car. When you need (want) another car, you will have a good chunk of the payment to pay cash for it or at least pay a large part of it.<br>  <br>  If you lost your job after paying off the car you wouldn't have much money to live on. Great job on not having credit card debt!

qjg0g5WMaa	yes just take it to a reputable shop<br>  good luck|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Depends on what state you live in as to how many plugs can be put in a tire to seal leaks.  Also depends on where it is leaking.  If the hole or leak is in the sidewall, it is not legal in any state that I am aware of to plug a hole in the sidewall.  If it is in the tread no problem, but right on the cusp of the tread and sidewall and most shops will refuse to patch it there.<br>  <br>  Of course you could always buy your own tire plug kit and fix it yourself-they run about $10 at a local autoparts store and have enough plugs to keep you happy for years.|`|LJv3pgeCaa	Yes, general rule for tire patching is 3 patches then the tire is ruined... If the current patch is leaking..it is possible to patch, but most shops will prolly turn you away or try to get you to buy a new tire. As long as the current leak is not near the old patch you should be golden.... Try not to drive on the tire flat, it will compromise the sidewalls which will make the tire no good as well. If you drive on it flat you will start to notice a ring around the tire's sidewall which means the inner sidewall is already starting to fall apart. Hope this helps.|`|VCdetbaQaa	You can have up to a total of 3 plugs/patches in a tire before it has to be replaced with a new one. Some shops may do no more than two. Since it is leaking again take it back to the place you had it done before they should take it in free of charge, if its leaking from the placed patch that is.

HFrsH9MRaa	This engine is fuel injected. This means that the throttle is only an air valve and does not regulate fuel directly. Use Gum-out spray to clean your throttle body and idle air control valve. Think of your pedal as an "air" pedal (which it is) and NOT a gas pedal. Pumping it, only affects the amount of AIR mixing with the fuel, which is pre-determined. You may have a bad sensor or flaky wiring harness. Power wash your engine bay to get a better look at things. The most common problem with these cars is a leaking intake manifold gasket. You might be sucking in coolant when this thing tries to power up. Good Luck!!|`|AA10276489	That's a new one. You should never pump the accelerator pedal on a fuel injected car. The accelerator does nothing except allow more air to enter the engine when you step on it. It has no connection to the fuel syatem. The computer (ecm) reads the amount the accelerator is open and supplies fuel accordingly.|`|dip4oxB5aa	By pumping the gas pedal it sends a signal to the computer to go in what is called a high fuel mode.  The computer then instructs more fuel to be sent to the vehicles main engine.  <br>  It could be a sign of partially clogged fuel injectors. Perhaps a throttle body injection cleaning or add some fuel injection cleaner to your fuel.
7L0zp7O6aa	Actually the motor in the RS is very different than the WRX and is not a good candidate for turbocharging.  Your motor has much higher compression with internals that are brittle compared to the WRX.  There are aftermarket turbo kits out there for a lot of money but you can only run less than half the boost you can with a WRX so the return in power gain is not really worth the money.  Your only option is to do a motor and ECU/harness swap into your car.  It will in the end cost about as much as buying a used WRX but insurance will be cheaper. Once you do the swap, there are so many things you can do from there to gain a bunch more power so it can be a fun little car.  Read up on RS25.com for some good info on your car.  Many people on there with RS's with STI swaps.|`|GLKeyUucaa	The 98-01 2.5RS is just begging to be turbocharged. It is all set up for a turbo to be dropped in and a top mounted intercooler to be installed.  This is a very good motor and there are many aftermarket options for this car.<br>  <br>  I owned a 2000 2.5RS coupe and was planning on turbocharging it at one point.

Check out a few episodes of World's Wildest Police Chases.|`|tlue10gAaa	Just because you are capable of going faster doesn't mean you will get away. Police radio works well to get other officers in position to get you stopped. Usually you will be chased because that is their job - to get law breakers. A chase helps break up the day. Quite often the person being chased has seriously over rated their driving ability and it is simply a matter of when they will wreck the vehicle. So all the officer has to do is follow and wait for the crash. Most chases are because the driver should not be driving because they don't have a license or something minor like that. If an officer is chasing a fleeing felon, they may take the opportunity to ram you and watch the crash. The officer doesn't have to pay for the damage to the police car (if any - some have push bumpers that can be used to force you sideways). I am not aware of any officer that would tell you they would not chase you.|`|JO3HiGfHaa	Under the situation that you did nothing other then wreckless driving, a cop will chase you within reasonable cause. Reasonable cause for the cops safety, your safety, and the safety of others. Many cops don't chase street bikes because it's too unsafe to the biker and it's unlikely they will get caught. <br>  I believe a cop car (the ones around here) can do about 130 MPH, but I don't think a high speed chase is likely on the cop's behalf. I have a 12 second track car and I wouldn't try to run from the police, I know I can outhandle them and go faster but it's too risky with other drivers and animals on the road.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	yes, he probably would. cops dont care how high performance the suspect theyre dealing with's car is. they only terminate pursuits when its obvious that the suspect is putting everything on the line to try to get away. like, endangering too many people and such. i wouldnt advise running from the law. here in illinois, cop cruisers are ford crown victorias with police interceptor packages. those include superchargers, dual overhead cams, multiport fuel injection, dual exausts, and so on. they are not cars to mess with.|`|jYy6dDAZaa	You can beat the car but not the radio.|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	There is a point at which the police will stop pursuit, and try to apprehend another way, like with spike strips or road blocks.<br>  While a helicopter or even aircraft (police) may not be able to keep up with you, they can see a lot further then a policeman in a car.<br>  When they get an ID on the car, they will just wait for the driver to get home. Then cuff him and stuff him.<br>  Why make one ticket into two, or do hard time for such things?<br>  Getting stopped by a policeman and getting a ticket is cheaper then a reckless homicide ticket. I am sure that a DA could push for removal of the reckless part and just make it premeditated homicide.<br>  Always remember, the further they chase you the madder they get. One ticket can soon become a book full!|`|oLfLbkEcaa	you automatically recieve diplomatic immunity if you travel at speeds > 160 mph. fact. you are above the law.|`|5d69a2b5acd5128b7f6ba155c12e4e78aa	He'd follow you at a safe distance with a shovel to pick up the mess when (not 'if') you screw up.|`|874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	Sure he would, and you'd end up on tv, too!

But you would have to purchase low-profile tires in the right size to allow for clearance (over bumps) and turning radius (so they don't hit the fender).<br>  Another concern when deviating from the manufacturer's specs is the odometer.  The larger the tire -> the less revolutions it takes to go the same distance -> the bigger the discrepancies in miles traveled and speed indicated while driving.<br>  <br>  17" tires are pretty expensive.  I haven't seen many under $150.00 a piece.<br>  <br>  In any case, an actual tire dealer should be able to find the right tire per the aspect ratio, width and diameter of the tire you are replacing.|`|kFsviR9waa	why not just get the right lug pattern and offset thats not way off.

CdW7K8weaa	Firstly, for the EVAP, you might need a new gas cap. Then have the codes cleared with the same scanner that found them.

All cars are different in design and quality. I would first start by cleaning the idle air control valve, the throttle body and plate, and the PCV valve and hose. Use Gum-out.

Power wash your engine, and look for any vacuum leaks or failed rubber tubing. Good Luck!!|`|gUaXZPYmaa	have you touched the o2 sensors? when replacing them it might throw a code which you have to reset, but those sensors are very sensitive and if any thing touched the little round part in the front it can easily mess it all up, simple as that. so if you took off the o2 sensors to get to something or some kinda liquid got on them, it can cause them to not work.|`|yzZchHHTaa	try tightening gas cap to get rid of evap code, may have to replace.

Credit is a complicated process, so much in fact at I wrote a series of articles about credit, and credit laws. If you really want to learn more about credit, credit reporting, and how to get credit I recommend tht you read my entire series. It's great information for young adults who are just starting to learn about credit.

Do like what was said above ... replace the fuel pump. If you are still getting gas in the oil check that your carburetor isn't flooding  or if you have an electic fuel pump make sure you are not leaving it on. The fuel could be slowly leaking down past the rings into the oil if the carb is flooding. the first bet would be the fuel pump if it's a mechanical pump. Don't drive the engine like that. Change the oil before you crank it again<br>  -----------<br>  Added:<br>  It might be the new fuel pump could have got damage from the pump being loose. I really don't know for sure if that can happen, it's worth it just to try a new fuel pump.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is if you are using a Quadrajet is it could be the carb.

8GDBr2U9aa	Only if the dealer told you in writing that you could return the car. Otherwise, no. Car sales are final. Maybe you should have checked on the insurance before buying it?<br>  <br>  There is no statutory "cooling off period" when it comes to a vehicle purchase. The car is yours now.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	You made a bad decision, now you get to learn from it.  Even a dealer with a heart has no reason to take your bad decision off your hands.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Contrary to popular belief, Washington law doesn't allow a blanket three-day "cooling-off" period once you've signed a contract to buy a car or other major purchase. I often hear from readers who wrongly believe they have three days to change their minds and they're disappointed to learn this isn't true.<br>  <br>  Q: So when can you get out of a contract?<br>  <br>  A: State and federal laws give you the right to cancel contracts in very limited circumstances, including door-to-door sales, timeshares, business opportunities, credit-repair firms and health clubs. <br>  <br>  But there is no "cooling-off" period for automobile purchases or leases.<br>  <br>  "That's the biggest myth in the car business," said Doug Walsh, chief of the consumer protection division of the Attorney General's Office. "They think they can get out of a major purchase."<br>  <br>  Walsh advises not signing a contract until you read it, understand it and agree to it.<br>  <br>  Once you sign an agreement, you are legally bound. Have a clear understanding of what you're buying and be sure you read any contract carefully before signing it, he said.<br>  <br>  According to the Attorney General's Office, consumers have the right to cancel a contract in these specific cases:<br>  <br>  <br>  Membership contract with a health club: three business days from signing to get a refund.<br>  <br>  <br>  Timeshare purchase: seven business days after signing the contract or after receiving the state-required disclosures about the timeshare, whichever comes later.<br>  <br>  <br>  Door-to-door sales and sales at home shows, expos and seminars: three business days on sales of more than $25. Examples include sales at a seminar in a hotel banquet room or a sales party at someone's house. <br>  <br>  <br>  Retail purchases involving payments made in installments: three business days. Common examples are vacuum cleaners and magazine subscriptions. This state law applies if the contract was made away from the seller's usual place of business or by commercial telephone solicitation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Telemarketing sales: within three business days of getting written confirmation (a sale isn't final until you get it in writing). The written confirmation should explain how to cancel and provide an address to send your cancellation notice. You also can cancel if you don't get the item within 42 calendar days.<br>  <br>  <br>  Contracts with credit-repair companies: five business days from signing it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Home-equity loans or lines of credit: The federal Truth in Lending Act gives borrowers three business days after signing a contract to walk away from a loan without paying a penalty. This cancellation right applies when you use your home to guarantee repayment for a personal loan. It doesn't apply on loans to buy or build your principal home, if you refinance your loan with the same lender or if you're borrowing from a state agency. You have until midnight of the third business day to cancel the credit transaction, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If you decide to back out, you must notify your creditor in writing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hearing aids: within 30 calendar days of delivery for reasonable cause, and not merely because you've changed your mind. <br>  <br>  <br>  Business opportunities that let you start a business through the purchase or leasing of equipment: seven business days; does not apply to franchises.<br>  <br>  <br>  Memberships to camping clubs: three days to cancel, but you get six days if you didn't get a chance to inspect the camping club facilities first.<br>  <br>  <br>  Private vocational schools that don't grant degrees: five days to cancel and get your money back in full if you haven't started your training.<br>  <br>  To cancel a contract, the Attorney General's Office recommends that you write a letter to the company explaining that you want to cancel the purchase and keep a copy for your records. Mail the letter by certified mail and request a return receipt.|`|gEw83TRTaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  Contrary to the prior post, no states have a "cooling off" period when it comes to auto purchases.  Once ink is on paper, you are an owner.  This is why you check things out BEFORE you sign a contract.  Why in the world would you not take 2 min to call  your insurance company for a rate quote before buying?  You know that is one of the major required expenses when you own a car.<br>  <br>  Its not the dealers problem that you have high insurance rates.  They are not there to budget for your entire life.  They presented a car, and a car payment.  You agreed to the terms.  They have no control over your insurance.  SHould they take it back if the price of gas is more than you thought?  What about if the price of hamburgers goes up?  No.  Those are your budgetary items, and things they you should have considered before buying.|`|iia5857maa	No.  Not to sound inconsiderate, but barring legal issues/incarceration, if all of a sudden you can't make $180/month and $490 on insurance...something is askew here.

1bYITsABaa	Fluid might be low. Also, the transmission filter might be dirty. As the transmission warms up, the fluid gets thinner, making it easier to flow through the gears etc.<br>  With only 50k miles on it, I would go get it serviced. Can't hurt, right?|`|HFrsH9MRaa	The usual cause is age related deterioration of the trans fluid viscosity. As the fluid ages, the viscosity and chemical properties of the fluid thins down and changes.Read your OWNER's Manual for the EXACT specification and identification of trans fluid numbers. Have a competent shop drop your tranny pan, spray down the valve body with chlorinated Brake Clean (which dissolves loose friction material) and have ONLY the GENUINE fluid added, complete with filter and gasket change. Because your torque converter never completely drains, you might need to have the fluid changed TWICE! Also, this problem may also be related to confused signals coming from your throttle body and idle air control valve. Have these items thoroughly cleaned with spray Gum-out to insure proper operation. These gizmo's affect the operation of trans, as well. When your car is right, you should be able to just start the car, in any temperature, and drive away. Modern cars must be designed this way to conform with laws governing fuel was-ting. NEVER BELIEVE that all trans fluids are alike. This is what they usually tell you at the jiffy lubes. Each car requires special properties from their trans fluids. Usually "bulk" fluids will not conform totally to the requirements. E.g, there is Dacron's, designed for use exclusively in Toyota. VW uses "gold" mineral based fluid, etc. Get the picture??? Good Luck. And, Ford transmissions are not notorious for breakdowns. They are usually notorious for having owners that don't read or understand their owner's manuals. The same thing holds true for nearly all car owners!|`|yzZchHHTaa	If you mean it shifts a little hard when cold, sounds normal, but I would still check it out, especially if it just started happening.  Might be due for a service on it anyways.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	first check your fluid level if that doesn't do it have someone replace the filter. i just don't see you having tranny problems quite yet. i'm not familiar with this make and could be wrong.|`|crhJLuw5aa	It's low on fluid. The reason it works ok when warmed up is because oil expands when heated.<br>  <br>  It absolutely DOES need to be fixed to prevent major damage to the transmission. One of the purposes of transmission fluid is to keep the parts in the transmission cool. The NUMBER ONE cause of automatic transmission failure is overheating, due to low fluid level.|`|f06Sy0dfaa	Fords are notorious for transmission problems. Before driving it, let your car warm up for 10 minutes or so. You should always do this if the weather is cold. If your transmission starts to slip after it's warmed up, then you are probably going to need a new transmission. They are really pricey, so maybe consider getting a new car if that 10 minute warm up doesn't work.|`|CdW7K8weaa	Sound like the seals are starting to go, the tranny fluid is old (the viscosity of the fluid has deteriorated), or both.<br>  You need to get your transmission fluid changed QUICKLY, but NOT flushed. <br>  Go to a parts store, get Lucas Stop Slip & have that put in with the new transmission fluid. This will help to lengthen the life of your tranny and condition the internal working parts. <br>  Do this ASAP. If you keep driving it like that, you will do irreversible damage, if it hasn't been done already. <br>  If this doesn't work, you will be looking at needing a new transmission. We replaced one of these ZX3's a couple of years back (I was an auto wholesaler) . We bought a tranny from a very reputable junk yard for around $400, <a href="http://www.precisionteam.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.precisionteam.com/.</a> The shop we took it to changed it for us for just over $400.|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi<br>  Check your transmission fluid. And I would put on an external cooler for the tranny|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it probably needs the fluid and filter changed. once a car sits overnight then dirt can settle in the filter and the pump can,t pick it up and after you drive it awhile the dirt gets washed away and your fine until the next morning. just pick up about 6 or 7 quarts of fluid, a filter and gasket and have someone change it for you.

For example I used to use a 12V 1000mA adapter to power my 500watt Punch amp to 2 10"s in my closet. Just an example though... Find the largest 12V adapter you can from an electronics store. Or better yet, look up the specs for your amp and see how many amperes it draws out and find a power supply slightly larger than that.

ST6uEAJQaa	As you said you have no clue of what you doing, so just forget about fixing it,...get rid of it, and buy new one,..let`s get this economy moving dude...|`|zOIgzIy4aa	take the face plate off and there should be a reset button. what you need to do about the wiring is go to radio shack and get the plug-ins then all you do is hook the colors together, tape them up and plug them into your factory wiring.|`|yzZchHHTaa	Look for a reset button behind face plate.  Otherwise you have to remove stereo and unplug it for a couple minutes.  Might get by with pulling fuse for it, wait a couple minutes and reinstall.
dPpOgny9aa	the 67 bug already is 12v system from factory,66 was last yr for 6 volt system.and stereo system from today will not fit indash will have to mount under dash.or can find a system with the old factory style,could try jc whittney.they sell stereo's for the beetle.|`|i5Y320Wraa	newer stereos wont fit into the air cooled bugs. you will either have to cut your dash to make it fit or mount it somewhere else like glove box or underneath the dash board. and to my knowledge there are no mounting kits or wiring harness's made for bugs. I may be wrong on that though.
EigB7rOTaa	well i think you need to check out MAC. i had a full offroad Mac h-pipe Prochamber (no cats) with the Prochamber cat back exhaust 3" with 3.5" tips.I had so many compliments on the exhaust it wasnt funny.I could make car alarms go off down the road.From all the Stangs ive owned,the MAC exhaust was the best and it was the only exhaust system i got compliments with.<br>  MAC is so pricey stuff but if you want the sound,your gonna pay for it.|`|AoNBI840aa	Go with a Flowmaster or a Magnaflow, those are really popular.|`|441079467ce415a17b70ee3db8a1c8d6aa	Forget the flowmasters.  Most of the peeps here saying go for them dont know much about the s197 cars.  They are not cat backs, they are axle backs and have a completely different sound.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do is to listen to clips on youtube or another site.  I did that and went with Macs for my 06.  I love them but they drone pretty bad.  Terrible sound at idle, but I think they sound the best when you hit the loud peddle.|`|4133829bdca1e81c2ab1ce235a28e20faa	Flowmasters sound the best on mustang's you can put something else on it if you want but it won't sound as good.  Go with dual chambers unless you can get away with a louder sound, then go with the single chambers.|`|9GVyRRhbaa	I've owned 3 'stangs, currently have an '07 GT, and have tried out Magna, Flowm, and Borla. Borla was the best so far hands down.|`|ws6wS1c2aa	It doesn't really make a difference. All mustangs will sound pretty much the same once u put an after market exhaust on them.
zOtiAN3xaa	ill bet you have sealed boxes on your subs!! they seem to sound wicked inside the car!! but when you open to boot to show some they sound gay!!! where as a box with some nice ports sound really nice when the boot is opened!!! i hnave no idea why!<br>  <br>  live loud!|`|exYJISb3aa	I guess it's not loud enough lol.<br>  It could be because an older truck? is it made out of metal?  It could be shaking and rattling because you're in a regular cab which would be like kindof sitting "inside the trunk" because your subs are just right there.<br>  There's really not a reason.  It just could be a good stirdy truck.  Sometimes it's louder than you think on the outside.|`|uL5772kCaa	Nothing wrong with that. That's actually better since you're keeping the sound inside the car.<br>  <br>  IDK why its not loud outside, but MANY people strive towards this. You should be glad you have a freeby.|`|DRwxJBrFaa	This probably means that your sub enclosure is not "tuned" or designed to the frequency that you are looking for.  Bass frequencies travel further and through things easier if they are lower.  <br>  <br>  If you think it sounds killer inside the truck, that's all you need.  If you want to entertain others, then ask them to donate to your stereo fund :)  <br>  <br>  With the angles and size of area within th ecab, you are going to be pretty limited.   You could always cut the back of the cab and front of the bed and seal them together so that your enclosure in in the bed (covered by a toneau) and have subs pounding into the cab - seen this done before and it SLAMS!!  but is a bit pricey!!  I had this done with (4) 15" jl subs once and it was a bit too much for a standard cab......|`|SNDxHMjQaa	Since when is this a problem? That's a good thing. You can listen to your music even louder without pissing off your neighbors.|`|VIWl8tRVaa	um cause when a sub is loud like steve meades or somethin its so loud its hard to hear inside and sounds better outside. or ur sub are junk|`|AA11318686	I've got a 97 accord with a 15 and inside it'll rattle your brains outta your head but outside you can barely hear the bass. Your truck might just be better insulated than most cars.|`|xUXW6Ufvaa	i have the same problem with my car<br>  <br>  i know i put my subs rear firing and it made it sound louder outside my car but then the inside sounded really bad,<br>  <br>  i used to care because i wanted to sound like those dum dum heads who have loud stereos but now i know that mine sounds much better<br>  <br>  usually if you cant hear it on the outside it sounds really good insde for some reason<br>  <br>  so just brag about how yours sound way better than all your friends

VCdetbaQaa	The lights coming on when you turn your key to the on position or when you start it and then go off is just kind of like a little test, it tests that the lights work and the components they represent work. if they go off everythings fine, if they stay on things need to be done. No need to worry.<br>  Every vehicle does it.|`|KZC1hdBXaa	when you first turn your car on they turn on to show you that they work if they dont go away then its time to worry but its normal for them to come on when you first turn the key on acc|`|qjg0g5WMaa	it fine they come on when you first start to signify they are working unless they stay on dony worry hope this helps|`|AA12181625	Yep,they're working|`|YwA1hbTTaa	no that doesnt mean you need it fixed.when you start your car your engine computer just boots up and it shows them for a few second its ok! it will stay on if somethings wrong but you can goto auto zone to get a free check engine light reading|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Think of it as the car running thru a self check everytime you turn the key on.  You are correct that there is no service required on any system unless the light comes on while the car is being driven or stays on, and does not automatically go out when the car is first turned on.|`|gGBPPjLeaa	This is perfectly normal at startup, it is self diagnosing its systems and you should be looking that the lights are not burnt out at startup as well. They go off once started because the self diagnosis is now complete and the oil symbol goes away because it now has oil pressure in the engine, .
e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	First things first understand that you can get much more for your Chrysler if you sell it on your own than trading it in. I'm willing to bet you can get between $2,000 and $3,000 for it at the least. Secondly as far as quality goes a Subaru beats a Nissan, so if you're looking at repairs and such the Subaru is the way to go. Thirdly if you want to go for the Impreza, I don't think you'll get id down to the 12k that you want. However If you sell your Chrysler on the side for $2,500, and talk them down to around $13,000 which I believe you should be able to do, your looking at realistically getting the Subaru for $10,500 when all is said and done.<br>  <br>  Be firm and don't be afraid to walk away.<br>  <br>  I was looking at a 2003 Toyota Celica GT-S for my wife. It had 112,000 miles on it, and they were asking $12,000 for it.<br>  We talked to the guy and said we could really only afford $9,000 as our ceiling. The guy pulled the whole bit and talked to his manager and all and said to us $10,500 is the lowest we can go. So we said thank you very much and walked away.<br>  Two days later I get a call from the guy in the dealership and he left me a message on my phone. He said, "were willing to work with you around selling you the car for $9,000, we need to clear out lot space... yadda yadda yadda".<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to walk away. And remember, there is always more than one of the car you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  Add: I just looked into the Chrysler for you, an LXi with 130,000 miles in good condition your looking at an even $2,000. I'm not sure what model or mileage you have so I just went up the middle with an average.<br>  <br>  Also since you need to keep your kids safe in the snow you really cant beat the Impreza's all wheel drive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and good luck.|`|PHyVkmPyaa	If there's snow or any though weather, you just have to get Subaru, you can't live without the AWD. But its Impresar 07 impreza wagon sound rip off for that much for the mileage. So cut them down.<br>  <br>  Altima isn't good for all weather...the reason they have good deal on those is because they want to get rid of them, since snow on front wheel aren't that good, means not a lot of people would want them.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	The Subaru will be much better in any kind of weather. As far as your trade goes, Chrysler products are not bringing squat.|`|4bNDqf60aa	Get the Subaru. Its more powerful than the Altima. Plus its newer.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	You live in NY where there's lots of snow and rain. That leaves only one choice ... the Subaru. It's been making all wheel drive cars since the 70's. And Subaru knows how to make them right. AWD is the safest choice over any other kind of car in inclement weather. <br>  <br>  A Nissan is front wheel drive, which is better than rear wheel drive in the snow. But it can't hold a candle to the traction and safety factor of a Subaru during the winter months. <br>  <br>  The dealer is asking $1000 more than KBB and NADA because it's a car in high demand. But with sales being down the toilet, they'll take a $12500+fees deal from you. Tell the salesman this is all you can pay so it's all you're offering. Stand firm on your price. If he comes back a second time with a price that isn't what you want to pay, walk. You'll get your price then.<br>  <br>  Regarding your trade, if you can get $900 take it! Chrysler resale value is all but dead in today's market. Especially for a ten year old Sebring, which still suffers from rental-car syndrome.
IyVUp35Haa	Well the car is to new to tell.  Miles are not a big issue these days seriously, its a tough thing to accept for most people these days.  And yes even age has little to do with judging a car.  CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION is the majority deciding factor in buying a used car these days.  I want to say this now every model and some times the year of the model have common problems.  Since that car is not old enough there really are no common problems on them yet. So with this question there is no way to be able to say "well the cylinder heads typically go at this mileage or the trans at that mileage. But again condition is key NOT mileage. SOoo come cars parts die at certain mileages big whoop they can be repaired and be again in good condition. <br>  So the car racked up 60K in almost or over 2 years depending on when it sold. All cars need care and repairs and not to go back to the miles thing and look like I was wrong about miles.  I did point out condition and a good condition car has all the maintenance and parts it needed replaced and not deferred.  Hence a good used car is in good condition.  When any car/truck racks up that kinda usage in 2 years it most definably a highway  used car, meaning its been going down the road at highway speeds for long periods of time in top gear the brakes no being used, hitting bumps in the road at higher speed causes in less wear to the suspension system, the oil pressure is up high ect.  basically less stop and go. The basic formula for a highway miles car is 1/3 of the odometer readout. YES YES I know miles are not the issue. just pointing out a car used on the highway a lot wears out parts much slower than a typically used car where lots of city driving is in the formula. <br>  So the only real wear and tear to a mostly highway used car is tires wheel bearing and the drivers seat.  Highway cars don't follow the typical miles it does this thing.  <br>  Cars these day don't have the usual things going on where getting to 200K is near the end of its life mostly becasue the engine is worn out and the cost of replacing is not a smart financial decision, also in the past most makes of cars were very short lived compared to cars starting in the mid 90's and up.  <br>  Yes there are many makes and models and each manufacture has a different life expectancy as to when it becomes downright stupid to put any money into them to keep the in good condition., but in general these days miles and age can't be looked at as a basis on if the car is worth buying/keeping its all condition.

Thank you for letting us know. Have a nice day :-D|`|aEeCCHVlaa	For me, there are other things to consider besides looks:  purpose of using the vehicle (just transportation, need to haul small things, etc.); gas mileage; odometer mileage; previous owner (and usage); mechanical/ repair history; and cost to maintain it.  Personally, I would never lease a vehicle because of the way the contracts are written (all for the benefit of the dealership - not for the leasee).|`|lcchJUuCaa	I would go with the civic. its more sporty looking.<br>  <br>  it gets better gas mileage, cheaper insurance and probaly more fun to drive.<br>  <br>  i'd love to have a civic

Hope you can be on hand to help scratch a cat. Details will follow...(signed) John L. Cutter – Chevrolet Public Relations – SEPAW Secretary." The following day, the same journalists received another General Motors telegram stating, "Society for the Eradication of Panthers from the Automotive World will hold first and last meeting on June 28...(signed) John L. Cutter – Chevrolet Public Relations SEPAW Secretary." These telegrams puzzled the industry.<br>  <br>  On June 28, 1966, General Motors held a live press conference in Detroit’s Statler-Hilton Hotel. It would be the first time in history that 14 cities were hooked up in real time for a press conference via telephone lines. Chevrolet General Manager Pete Estes started the news conference stating that all attendees of the conference were charter members of the Society for the Elimination of Panthers from the Automotive World and that this would be the first and last meeting of SEPAW. Estes then announced a new car line, project designation XP-836, with a name that Chevrolet chose in keeping with other car names beginning with the letter C such as the Corvair, Chevelle, Chevy II, and Corvette. He claimed the name, "suggests the comradeship of good friends as a personal car should be to its owner" and that "to us, the name means just what we think the car will do... Go!" The new Camaro name was then unveiled. Automotive press asked Chevrolet product managers, "What is a Camaro?" and were told it was "a small, vicious animal that eats Mustangs."[4]<br>  <br>  The Camaro was first shown at a press preview in Detroit, Michigan on September 12, 1966 and then later in Los Angeles, California on September 19, 1966. The Camaro officially went on sale in dealerships on September 29, 1966 for the 1967 model year.|`|AA11119924	Looks like this.|`|Sksd55zeaa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/?q=descrive%20camaro" rel="nofollow">http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/...</a>|`|2oAQ5O6oaa	SEXY!!!

They are great cars, but every car will eventually break down, and BMW are notoriously expensive to fix. I would not pay more than $2500 for that car. I paid $3500 for mine on CL, and it's a convertible in mint shape.|`|YLajQcFkaa	I agree with Mr. George 100% and disagree with Jack.  Car owners are usually one of two things and never both.  The two car owners things are "all about looks" and "all about mechanical"  Rarely do you see an owner spend money on looks and mechanical issues. I get cars in all the time for buyers inspections where the car looks brand new but upon closer inspection the owner deferred maintenance and repairs.|`|jElPErGmaa	Good car and it is worth for that money. My friend has a 92 325i with over 270,000 manual trans. but the damn thing still runs. $2500 is good but be prepared to deal with any major issues because the car has a lot of miles. Bimmers are expensive to fix and their parts too. If he has been taking care of the car well, it shouldn't give you troubles at all but like any old car, be prepared to fix anything.|`|YTG3bCeDaa	It would help if you told us the price of the car.<br>  <br>  Honestly though, it looks from the photos like this car has had its day.  I personally wouldn't even consider a used car if it had more than 170000 miles on it or so, and even then I'd be reluctant to use it as a daily vehicle.  It really depends on how much you intend to use it and what the price is. If you want to use is as a second car or project car, maybe, but otherwise I'd look elsewhere.|`|cn0ALwwLaa	They run Perfect.<br>  <br>  Not this one, though, This one is a veat-on unloved piece of crap.

You will end up putting more money into that heap than a later model. bimmer's will run along time if you manage the service correctly. 2500??? the owner should be beaten with a hose -twice. check craigs list I have seen way nicer bmw on there for only a little more. like i said that one needs money put into it.

I say go with a car that has less miles.|`|OXfZUQV0aa	Very long very well, but 200k miles is a lot|`|IyVUp35Haa	Judging from the condition of the seats I would say that car is a highway car. However every car has its quirks.  A used car is all about condition where miles and age are very little in the equation to determine if the car is a good buy or not/ in good condition or not. All the 3 series since the next generation after the e30 have a heat problem under the hood.  The heat from the engine actually kills the engine AND the automatic transmissions in those 3 series.  Usually in southern California its about 150K and its cooked.  You live in a "mild" climate or at least the car did, so you can expect the time before its cooked to be longer. But at 200K I think its coming due for a new engine and automatic trans. <br>  The car appears to be in good over all condition from the pictures you provided BUT that was just "looks" pictures and not "mechanical" pictures and no picture can tell the real story as to the condition of the car.  Parts can be cleaned to look new even tho they are worn out. So a good buyers inspection or two is always the only best thing you can do when buying a used car.  Techs who work on just a certain make know things no books or  web sights can tell you.  I being a BMW tech when looking at a car do not consciously look at things like going thru a list on paper or in my mind.  its the things we see that kick our subconscious into gear to zone in on a problem. Hows that for a strange statement.

CdW7K8weaa	Jack should be guaranteeing the work they just did in October. When getting your 2nd/3rd opinion, take it to a Mitsubishi dealer as well. <br>  If it truly is the same issue, tell the investigating mechanic you just had that work done in October at another garage. See what they say... <br>  If it is the tie rod & link, is this for the other side? It sounds expensive for just one side, seeing that the other side was just done, if this is the case. Mitsubishi parts can be expensive though.<br>  If they tell you there is no way that part was replaced or whatever it is, then you know Jack ripped you off. You will need to go back there & let them know if they don't remedy the problem, you are going to the General District Attorney's Office & the Better Business Bureau. <br>  If it is not the same problem, but a new one, get back to us on the new issue.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	they must not have fixed it in the first place or it would,nt have gone bad in that length of time. they just riped you off.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	FIrst of all, how many miles on this??? Check the warranty that Jack offered you when the repair was done the first time. If he did NOT us genuine Mitsubishi parts, they might not last as long as the factory originals. Jack should be responsible!!! Have the good sense to have your car examined at a Mitsubishi dealer. Often, they will examine it for free. If "Jack" installed inferior aftermarket parts with no warranty (and there are lots of those) I would hold him responsible with a small claim court threat. The only other thing is, your car might have a hidden problem, like a bent frame, that only a totally professional shop would be able to discern. In that case, the same parts will wear out over and over again due to the lack of suspension symmetry. A good frame shop should be consulted. Tie rods can prematurely wear if the tires have broken belts, as well. This adds stress to steering components as well. Good Luck!!|`|yzZchHHTaa	There should have been some kind of warranty on the work they did before, ask them.  For sure get at least 2 more quotes.<br>  <br>  If it's tie rod ends or ball joints, they can be done at home if you have a little knowledge and a good repair manual.

Then stop and say "You're not fun - you're not COOL at all!" and then walk away while discreetly dropping a booklet entitled "How to be COOL."  While they are reading it go inside the house.  Wait five minutes then come outside WITH your cousin - by that time your sibling should be jumping up and down on the car's hood quacking like a duck.

(see the HURT study link below).<br>  <br>  Full face helmets provide you with the greatest amount of protection, 3/4, 1/2, and beanie helmets, respectively, provide lower degrees of protection.  Only full face helmets will have the SNELL safety standard.<br>  <br>  If you want an open face helmet with a flip-up face shield check out the Shoei J-Wing or Bell's Mag-8.<br>  <br>  You may be interested in a modular style helmet such as the Shoei MultiTec: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://alivetoride.com/motorcycle_gear_reviews_shoei_multitec" rel="nofollow">http://alivetoride.com/motorcycle_gear_r...</a><br>  <br>  Modular style motorcycle helmets provide full face protection but also allow you to "flip-up" the chin area leaving the entire face open to talk, eat, take a photo, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you choose to go for a full face or full face modular helmet - you can use our motorcycle helmet comparison chart, which ranks numerous helmets on several criteria and lists them by brand, ranking, and price, to help your decision:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://alivetoride.com/motorcycle_helmet_comparison_chart" rel="nofollow">http://alivetoride.com/motorcycle_helmet...</a>|`|upn683hZaa	i would go for a full face i feel more safer in them if you think its going to spoil ur image get a cool wacky one but make sure its decent not a cheapy <br>  <br>  go for well known brands like shark and agv and see if they come in cool designs <br>  <br>  but its up two you good luck|`|51tNYexBaa	I always wear Arai helmets, they are the best, but kinda pricey.

gEw83TRTaa	Your parents are probably just being cautious, considering the current employemtn and economic situation we alll find ourselves in.  Odds are they would be the ones signing a contract, or at the very least co-signing.  Given the current instability, I wouldnt want to be in that position either.<br>  <br>  You say you will pay for it "eventually".  Banks dont deal in "eventually", they deal in now, monthly, every month.  What happens when you lose your job?  Its far more likely than you think.  <br>  <br>  How about you just cool down, take a look at it from a reasonable, responsible perspective, and take the mature path.  Your parents dont need the added stress of you being upset that you didnt get your new toy.<br>  <br>  BTW - you wont get $6-7k for a 132k Eclipse.|`|PHyVkmPyaa	Sorry evo is not for average, or poor people to own, they have high maintain cost, and lots of problems when comes tunning. <br>  Few of my friends had evo 8 all used certified form dealer, until they got sick of it, because they have to maintain, fix small problems every month. <br>  but then they do race.

(at a good interest rate - 6ish% - and if you put 4k down so you're financing 12k, the payments will be around $250 - make sure you're ok with that)|`|iia5857maa	bite the bullet and sell the eclipse first.  that is the rational  thing to do here unless you can afford 2 insurances.   2002 ec with 132k get 6 or 7.?

If they're needed in the deal, listen to them without question.  They are smarter than you. what they say goes.  Additionals:  well sell it bro!!

RjUhISEIaa	Truenorth and Richard are heading the right way with their answers but more info from you would be great.<br>  <br>  Thinking back to my days of having a trailerable boat that had an 8'6" beam the trailer tires extended outside of the boat and she was legal to haul down the highways and interstates. In Virginia the definition of "trailerable" applies to the boat and not the trailer itself. <br>  <br>  Do you need a wide load sign? No. Is one recommended? No. Why? You're trailer is going to be well inside the 11' to maybe 12' lanes.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|tDZMJue9aa	to be on the safe side why not add one on there anyway...|`|6HMTlQMaaa	OK, your trailer is 8'1" and you are under the limit. <br>  <br>  Now, what you are hinting at is that your boat is wider than the 8'6"<br>  <br>  Yes?<br>  <br>  Load is defined as the load, boat and trailer combined, if one or both exceeds the limit then you need to abide by the wide load rules in your state.<br>  <br>  Here in Minnesota that means permits, flags, and limited travel hours.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|nAzbLdBCaa	It's not the trailer, it's the boat.  Interstates have a height limit of 13 ft. but with the correct signs and permits you can go much wider than 8'6".  So, you need to know weight of everything, tow truck, boat and trailer.  Then how wide you are, and how high.  You didn't say which boat you have.  You might need both signs and marker lights.   But, it's nothing you can't handle.  Good Luck!|`|jYy6dDAZaa	If you bought ther trailer trust the manufacturer to know the rules.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	Check with state laws but should be 102" as that what my car hauler is> It means wides point boat included>

aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa	What you see is something call contrail (for CONdensation TRAIL). This is not deliberate, this is just the consequence of the jet exhaust (which is essentially carbon dioxide and water vapor) cooling and condensing in the very cold upper atmosphere. The water will form ice crystals that can linger on for sometime if the humidity existing at altitude is just right.<br>  <br>  So, there is no real purpose, not anymore than your breath being "steamy" when you exhale in cold air.|`|JMJsCU1vaa	What you're referring to is "CHEMTRAILS" which is a conspiracy theory that plans are poisoning us by these chemtrails... it's a Hoax... just like Global Warming...<br>  both HOAX'S|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	It isn't smoke, it's water.

The trails of condensation left by the aircraft have the same composition as clouds.|`|AA11119924	Planes only release smoke deliberately during flight demonstrations such as airshows.

t2XRy9G5aa	it's your clutch, not transmission...<br>  <br>  possibly just need to make a slight adjustment to the cable tension to allow the plates to fully engage.  the adjustment on the clutch perch (left handlebar) needs to be screwed in ... with engine running and clutch lever pulled in, the lever should be about 1/2 inch from the grip when you start feeling the bike trying to pull...<br>  <br>  if that doesn't help, either your plates are worn or the springs need to be replaced or both...|`|51tNYexBaa	Sounds like clutch to me.

5385f2aa192bffdaaa56b3912bf7e017aa	actually, it is the operator's responsibility.  So, you need to get it fixed, since you were issued the ticket.

That is about the only two things that it could be. I have a 93 Lesabre and there isn't much else on the throttle assemble.|`|LX0vjwXPaa	There are other possibilities too.  The idle system typically has an idle air controller/valve.  If this valve gets dirty it can stick in a more open position.  Locate it, take it out, clean it, and put it back in.  Sticky throttle cable is a possibility, but I would say unlikely.  Another potential issue would be a vacuum leak, which woul dlet more air into the engine, which is what drives the idle.|`|ulNbahJ4aa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/?q=Buick%20Lesabre" rel="nofollow">http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/...</a>

zruhNGKbaa	Yes, with either engine, as long as the truck is equipped with the factory Tow and Haul package which includes a high capacity radiator and transmission cooler.  Also you absolutely need 4 Wheel Drive to get up out of slippery boat launches - if it does not have 4X4 do not even think about using it to tow and launch a boat!  <br>  <br>  If however you intend to tow extensive distances you would be well advised to move up to a 3/4 ton truck equipped with the Diesel Engine for greater economy and longevity in heavy use.  <br>  <br>  I would buy a 5 year old Diesel 3/4 ton 4X4 instead for roughly the same money.|`|6HMTlQMaaa	Yeah, easy.|`|pl6Mh5K1aa	That truck could tow a Yacht if they came on wheels! <br>  <br>  Seriously I could pull the boat you have on probably a 4 cly engine.|`|51tNYexBaa	Assuming the truck came with the tow package, as in stock trailer hitch, yes it should tow it fine|`|3EWB5Kwxaa	the 4.7 would pull that without any problem, i have pulled much larger boats with one|`|AA10448138	YEA, BUT GET THE HEMI.

Many airlines do not even have height requirements, but instead require that you be able to reach to a certain height.<br>  <br>  VISION: Correctable eyewear or contact are allowed to ensure you can meet the corrected vision requirements.<br>  <br>  WEIGHT: There are NO weight standards at US airlines. You will only be visually assessed and the recruiter is looking for weight in proportion to height. <br>  <br>  EDUCATION: Only a high school diploma (Or GED) is required. NO prior schooling or training is required. The airline that hires you will provide all of your training. Airline training material is highly specific and safety sensitive and cannot be purchased. You cannot receive your airline training from any place other than the airline, regardless of what you might see on the internet.<br>  <br>  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Some airlines will require some customer service experience. This can be in any type of situation that brought you into contact with the public in some capacity. Usually, if you can demonstrate in your interview that you are aware of and can perform effective customer service, you are considered qualified.<br>  <br>  TEN YEAR BACKGROUND CHECK: You must be able to pass a ten year background check and drug screening.<br>  <br>  MEDICAL EVALUATION: Once selected you will undergo a physical to ensure you are in good health. <br>  <br>  As you can see, compared with most careers, the basic requirements for the flight attendant position make it very attainable, and that is why there are so many applicants for every one flight attendant opening.

3MTYGEbWaa	Technically, the car belongs to the finance company. You would have to buy the car from them to get legal title.

XKYJk6Tcaa	Remember the torque converter stores fluid along with the pan, the converter has a back flow restrict-or valve in it so that fluid stay in it. then when you start your car the pump in the transmission will pump fluid through the trans and torque converter. that is why you always want to check your trans fluid with your car running. on a level surface. that give you the indication of if your low on trans fluid. When you checked it the first time it was probably just showing what was in the pan start your car and on a level surface check the trans. if it still shows low then fill to the proper level. if your showing no signs of a leak anywhere that is the only thing that it can be.|`|cddc8069d50a9c0970cf9101369f17fdaa	I had a ford truck that was the same way,it was really hard to read the dipstick and then I overfilled it and had to take the pan off to get the excess fluid out to prevent damage or blown seals.Be very careful not to overfill Your transmission as you will blow seals.

gGBPPjLeaa	Does it turn over? If not then it is most likely the starter or solenoid if our lights do not dim when you try and start it. Try hitting the starter if you need to start it to get it to a shop, a good whack with a screwdriver usually does it if it is going to work at all. If this does not work don't be surpirsed it is a long shot, next thing to  check would be if the battery terminals are dirty, even though the lights come on the sarter draws much more current.|`|434ae21c53144cc6040a9999bb94dfc6aa	take to repair shop|`|VCdetbaQaa	More information needed!

SOfbIOzUaa	Wrong. In order to lubricate an oil must be able to flow to the bearings. A 0W or 5W will flow better at cold temperatures and therefore provide better lubrication upon start up in cold climates. Once warmed up the internal temperature of an engine is pretty much the same regardless of the time of year. So the top viscosity number in this day and age is required more by how close the tolerances are of the engine than by any outdoor temperature. Thus some manufacturers now recommend 5W20 oil instead of 5W30 because those engines using 5W20 are built to closer tolerances.<br>  <br>  Use what your vehicle manufacturer recommends.<br>  <br>  And the "W" does not stand for weight. It stands for winter.<br>  The best oil in the winter in Canada would be Mobil 1 0W30 if 5W30 or 10W30 is recommended for your vehicle or 0W20 if 5W20 is recommended.  I use 0W30 in my '96 Honda even though 5W30 is recommended and I use 0W20 in my '02 Honda CR-V even though 5W20 is recommended.  These oils may be used year-round and it doesn't matter if you live in Canada or Mexico although they will protect your car more during cold weather in the North.<br>  <br>  Thicker is Better Myth<br>  The reason that oil viscosities have gotten thinner is because bearing clearances have become smaller. Using thicker oils will interfere with oil flow and the oil pressure will increase. In a worn engine it may be okay to increase the viscosity of the oil because the bearing clearances have become larger.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	the w stands for winter referring to the weight of the oil when it is cold. a light weight oil will get to the critical areas faster than a heavy weight oil. when the engine is warm oil viscosity will increase and there by increases  the protection that it offers to loaded areas of an engine.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Because you want the lightest weight possible for ease of starting.  If your engine oil was say straight 30 weight all the time, then it would be a lot harder for the battery and the starter to even just turn the engine over, so hence chemically they alter oil to make it lighter.  Then as the ENGINE heats up, the oil gradually get thicker up to the maximum specified on the bottle-give or take a small amount.  It has nothing or very little to do with outdoor temperature, but engine temperature.  It can be -20 degrees outside but if the vehicle has been driven at 60 mph for 3 hours the internal temp of the engine will be about 700 degrees.  <br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question|`|uFQFRdczaa	A couple generations ago, oil was sold by straight-up weight.  30-weight, 40-weight.  The higher the number, the better the oil's cooling and lubricating power, and the more it sticks to engine parts--and the more work it takes to move the engine parts through the oil.  Most engines were built to run on 30 or 40 weight, so the oil won't break down at the engine's running temperature.  But in a Canada winter, 40-weight is as thick as molasses.  In the cold, when your battery is weakest, making the engine turn is just about impossible.  So you use a multigrade oil, say, 10w40.  At normal ambient temperatures, this oil acts like a 10-weight, but when it gets hot (over 150) it starts acting like a 40-weight.  <br>  <br>  Some cars owners manuals have a chart recommending what oil to use in what climate.  You need 10w if you're going to be starting below 30 F.  You need 40 if it's going to be over 100F.  30w is ok between 30F and 90F, or something like that.|`|VCdetbaQaa	That is so it can efficiently lubricate your motor and transfer heat in all conditions preventing motor lock up from the oil freezing or getting so hot it loses its lubricating qualities.
WO68RZdIaa	A few states may have stricter guidelines for when you first get your permit, but in most states, as long as you have a qualified licensed driver with you, you can drive on any public roads- whether it's a city street, county road, State/US Highway or Interstate- starting the day you get your permit.<br>  <br>  Contact your local DMV office or go to their website to get specific information regarding teen drivers for your state.|`|XLXncQu9aa	This is true in certain states.  I would say this depends on what state you live in.  For example, some states have an increased month limit of how many months a teen driver can wait to drive without an adult.  It all depends on your state laws.|`|w3kJ67v6aa	It depends on the state, but usually as long as your with a parent then thats fine.  Your learners permit is so you can learn how to drive, so that would make sense that a parent could take you on the freeway.  I know that when I had my learners permit I drove on the freeway alot.  So i would just assume that the same rules apply as any other street
AA11318686	Fb is the tuning frequency of the box which means that at 50 Hz the box will be louder but below that you'll lose control of your cone because below a boxes Fb it's essentially a free air set up and most subs need an enclosure to create back pressure on the cone so it doesn't go too far in or out.  I'd go with the probox because it's tuned slightly lower, but if you're going to be playing alot of rap you won't want either one because when it comes to tuning frequencies they both are tuned pretty high and ra beats play in the 30-40 Hz rang which would result in damage to your subs if you bought either of these boxes.|`|uL5772kCaa	Oh god neither!!

Not to mention that the insurance prices in the city are ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Look into cars like the Honda Civic or the Toyota Corolla.

The Impreza is smaller than the Legacy, but the Legacy is much better. They have pretty decent gas mileage and a locking fuel filler door comes standard, released by a switch INSIDE the car, on the floor. It really helps to prevent siphoning. The trunk in the Legacy looks small from the outside, but is really large on the inside. Although not a major issue in a big city, but the AWD makes winter driving much more safer. Speaking of safety, ABS comes standard, too.
qjg0g5WMaa	The first automotive pollution control device was the PCV, the positive crankcase ventilator, which was introduced voluntarily by the US industry, prior to any legislated requirement, in the late 50's on all US built California automobiles. The following year, all US built cars were similarly equipped by the manufacturers on a voluntary basis. The PCV is now standard on all cars built in the world.<br>  <br>  The first legislated exhaust emission standards were promulgated by the State of California for 1966 model year for cars sold in that state, followed by the United States as a whole in model year 1968. Following that annual reductions in exhaust emission standards, but not fuel economy, were legislated by EPA.<br>  <br>  By 1974 model year the emission standards had tightened to the point where existing technologies, which favored emission control over fuel economy, were seriously increasing fuel usage.<br>  <br>  The new emission standards for 1975 model year, as well as the increase in fuel usage, forced the invention of new a technology, namely catalytic after-treatment of the exhaust gases. This was not possible with existing leaded fuels, (because the lead residue contaminated the platinum catalyst). In 1972 General Motors proposed to the American Petroleum Institute the elimination of leaded fuels for 1975 and later model year cars. The production and distribution of unleaded fuel was a major challenge, but it was completed successfully in time for the 1975 model year cars. All modern cars are now equipped with platinum catalyst emission converters and unleaded fuel can now be found almost everywhere.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	PCV valves in the late 50's and then in 1971 they started requiring the cars to all run unleaded gas and in 72 or73 they added the catalytic converters.|`|ulNbahJ4aa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/?q=car%20emission%20control%20start" rel="nofollow">http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/...</a>

qT442qIaaa	You will need an auxiliary cable (double sided head phone cable).  Somewhere near your car stereo you should see the letters "Aux" or a headphone port and this is where you would plug this cable in.  So you plug this cable in your ipod (or any audio device) and into the car.  You can buy this cable for 1.57 on ebay with free shipping!!  And they work cause i got one already.  Below is the link.<br>  <br>  Or there is a device that you can buy that you plug into the ipod that will transmit into your car's radio..but there is usually static.  So this auxiliary cable is perfect for you.<br>  <br>  So if you need the rca cable, the auxiliary cable at Walmart in the car audio section comes with it...just make sure it does or buy it seperately on ebay.|`|fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	You might also look for the aux plug in inside the center armrest console. Subaru puts them there on some models.<br>  <br>  You will need a cable that goes from the earphone jack of the ipod to the aux plug in. The cable will have the same plug on both ends. You can generally buy those at Wal Mart or Best Buy.|`|ZwCE4Rmwaa	In the forest with the nav package, like you have, there is no true auxiliary input.  However, in the center console, there is a video input with 3 rca jacks.  I know that you can't watch the video screen as you go down the road, but the audio from these inputs still works as you drive.  So, go to best buy and get a male mini jack to rca converter cable, plug the red and white cables into the red and white inputs, press the audio button on the lower right side of your nav panel and then choose video.  Plug in your ipod, turn it all the way up and start banging your head to your favorite Brandy Carlisle tune.  It took me 3 days to figure this out.  Why didn't subaru just offer a simple aux input?  Dunno. But this is the cheapest, cleanest way to get this done.  You just might have to buy a charger to keep the thing going on longer trips.  Hope I helped!

Polish is applied with a buffer and helps to restore the color of the paint by removing oxidation. it also remove all the old wax build up. and does not stay on the paint but gives a better shine when you wax your car because the polish has removed allot of the crud that is on your paint. So if your just waxing your car get some good carnuba base was and use that it will last longer and provide a better shine than most. you would need about16 ounces of wax to do your mustang. but I would recommend a detail job if the paint has been sitting out in the weather then you would use a three step process.

aDpWkGIwaa	hey man, im just like u i finished high school and now im in first year Aerospace Eng, first of all its very general the first year doesnt matter what engineering u choose first year=same courses, so u can always change ur mind for second year, and getting a job in the aerospace field is hard because its a lot more limited, all the companies u mentioned are to notch so u need to have good grades, but there are lot of other companies u can work for, a lot of grads tell us that they didnt work in the field directly after grad, but once they have a 1 or 2 years under their belt they got a aerospace eng job, so its no big deal. ur thinking about masters already? its good to think about but i think going through university will let u know what you should do after and if your grades are good enough your school will have a career oppourtunities for students who qualify so all i can say is dont screw up ur first year.

XLXncQu9aa	Automatic Teller Machines are mass produced so they only make one mold for all ATM’s. That means the ones that you walk up to and the ones that you have to drive up to. I mean think about it this way; if you need to stamp your signature on a lot of papers do you buy one stamp with your first name and another stamp with your last name? No, that takes to much time and spends money that does not need to be spent. It is the same idea with the Automatic Teller Machine companies, they buy one stamp that happens to have Braille on it and use it for all ATM’s. It is cost efficient and time efficient, so what if the Braille does not get used on the ATM’s that in a drive thru.<br>  <br>  Another reason is from a legal standpoint. It cuts out the blind’s equal rights to use that Automatic Teller Machine, just because it is in a drive thru. If they really wanted to they could walk up to the ATM in a drive thru and use it. Whether they happen to know the way to it, they have a Seeing Eye Animal or they are legally blind but not totally bind, it cuts away their right to use that ATM if there were not Braille printed on it. So to keep from being sued the ATM companies’ produce all ATM’s with Braille, and the banks put an ATM with Braille on it in their drive thru.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Because they use the same machine designs for the walk up ones.

People like this sound so they install BOV's on Turbocharged cars.<br>  <br>  Bypass valves are what comes with the car stock. You do not here the turbo's boost everytime you shift. It is quiet.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	The stock BPV is designed to re rout the vented air back into the turbo inlet right before the turbo.  Since it's after the MAF sensor, whenever you blow off, the computer automatically compensates for the extra air by adding some fuel for a split second.  With a BOV, the air is vented into the engine bay.  When you do this, the ECU still assumes it's getting that air through the turbo so it still adds fuel.  When it does that but the air is not there, it can be bad for the engine.
AA12261615	start at 8 degrees with it,because on the newer engines they timed a lot higher,and work your way up with it,if your using a light and vacuum gage it will help you to set it,i go by the amount of vacuum i can get from one,the closer you get to being right the higher the vacuum will get and the smoother the needle will be on the vacuum gage,once you find the smoothest point lock the distributor down and see how well it runs and starts,it shouldn't drag when it tries to start if it does its still not right,it may take several attempts ,but they will usually run real good at 8-10 degrees,with hei you can go higher if needed,good luck.|`|us8g1Vjqaa	I would start with 8, being stock anymore than that probably wont work, you may get away with 10 but i'm gonna say it will be pushing it.

With the other tire (16") your speedometer reading will be off as much as 2 mph. In other words, when it shows 60, you will actually be going 58.|`|d13b96c180e9e64a5d7f4be883e97f9baa	Plus sizing tires is very common. Whoever says you can't change the size from the factory is wrong, but what you will want to do is to find a tire calc. For example, I have 205/50/r17 on my Legacy now, and when I replace them I am going to a 225/45/r17. Thats less then 2% diff so when my speedo says I am going 60 I will accually be goin 59.8(or something like that). The point is that you can change the ratios, just make sure the diameter of the tires are not too far off so you don't have to get your speedo recalibrated.|`|vRFbNxoeaa	225/60R16

If you've wanted this car for the past 10 years, have set owning one as a personal goal, and have been saving about 10% of your income, you could own one making only $200,000 per year.

99kYSEp0aa	Hi Geo!<br>  <br>  Your son should ideally be two to three months of age before you begin flying with him. By this age, his immune system will have grown strong enough to resist the germs that often spread through airplane fuselages. It will also allow your wife enough time to settle into the routine of breast- or bottle-feeding.<br>  <br>  Your son, however, should be okay to fly after his two-week checkup --- provided he has a clean bill of health and your wife had a full-term pregnancy without complications. If your son was premature, he is more likely to get germs, so he may need to wait longer before taking a trip on an airplane.<br>  <br>  Remember that your son’s pediatrician is a valuable asset. He/she will give you advice on whether or not your son is healthy enough to fly. If you have any questions, your son’s pediatrician is the person to turn to. <br>  <br>  Some airlines do not allow children under the age of one week to fly without a doctor’s note. Just keep that in mind, even though your son will be a month old when you take this trip to New York City.<br>  <br>  It is true that "popping ears" during takeoff and landing can be a bit painful for infants, but it won't cause any lasting damage. Please note that the pressure changes can be very uncomfortable if your baby has an ear infection. If your son has ear infections, you may need to postpone your flight.<br>  <br>  Infants feel more comfortable if they have something to suck on during takeoff and landing, so you may want your wife to breastfeed or give your son a bottle or pacifier during takeoff and landing. You can give him some infant pain reliever if his ears really seem to bother him.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped! Good luck, and have fun in New York City!<br>  <br>  Shoshanna<br>  xoxo|`|RbCry06Taa	Its best to consult a doctor or pediatrician because I think the effect of aircraft pressurization to a new born infant's inner ear might have an issue.|`|cQ6UFMmyaa	Depends if you can keep him/her from crying|`|GYwLGjt2aa	well i dont think it really matters. but i would ask you doctor|`|0jMTJjwYaa	I think it's too young.. wait till he grows a little bit
uti1JoI1aa	well, to start off, you can do some simple mods. of course, start with a good cold air intake. there are numerous companies that sell them for your car. theyll run you about $200-400 depending on what you get. next, you will want to get an aftermarket cat-back exhaust done. once again, there are a ton of companies making them for your car. expect to spend $1000-1600 on a nice one. once you have those two mods, you'll definitely notice a decent power increase, and your car will sound a hell of alot better. from there, you can do rear gears, i suggest 3.73's if you wanna get off the line really hard. from there, you can get a good stall speed converter if its an automatic, or an upgraded clutch if its a stick.

I pretty much in the same sitution as you. But your luck thats your price range...gives you more options.

So, you have a price range set for $28-30,000...that's a lot of money to throw around for a car brah.  Here's a suggestion(remember it's just a suggestion)...a lot of people are selling vehicles now-a-days just to make ends meet, or just need the cash.  So check out some cars that people are trying to sell...you can check them out online with Craigslist**remember when using Craigslist to make sure you have them show you proof that it is their car, including Pink Slip to vehicle, Auto Insurance, Registration Fees, etc.**  This way you can get a vehicle that doesn't have much miles on it and use the rest of the money to fix it up to how you want.  Say you get someone who is selling an average coupe or sports car for...well, let's say $15,000...now remember that this is a high estimate for a coupe or sports car...this would then give you right around another $15,000 to customize it to your style (new rims/tires, better motor, etc.).   Anyways, that's just an idea.  I did make some observations at a few auto dealer sites and what I found was if you wanted to go for a car with good/great gas mileage, then these would be the most stylish and fitting to your liking:<br>  2009 Toyota Corolla est. 26/35 mpg <br>  2009 Nissan Altima Coupe est. 32 mpg<br>  2009 Dodge Challenger est. 25+ mpg<br>  2009 Ford Coupe est. 24-35 mpg<br>  2010 Ford Fusion est. 17-34 mpg<br>  ...but I just recently checked out the 2009 Chevy Cobalt Coupe and the features on that ride were off the hook...here's the link so you can check it out yourself, and compared to the other guys...they never really measured up.  Now this ride can come as a regular(boring) coupe, or you can get this coupe in the SS Supercharged version, which is not only sleek looking and fast, but will DEFINITELY NOT make you look like a dork...it is also within your price range with an estimated mpg of 22/30.  It's safety rating is off the charts too, especially with Onstar and Blu Tooth compatible components, so you don't have to worry about getting any cell phone ticket laws ;-)<br>  <br>  Hit me up if this helped at all...I'll keep an eye out for other cars.<br>  <br>  Lattaz brah.

fe9b89ef9075d826f6d2b372470173b0aa	Your A/C system does not use coolant. It uses a refrigerant. If you replaced your coolant 2 weeks ago, there may have been some air in the system that has worked its way out. Since the air was taking up space that should have been used by coolant, once the air made its way out of the system, the coolant level would drop since it replaced the air pocket that might have been there.<br>  <br>  Try adding more coolant. Check it every few days. If you are still losing coolant, you may have a leak in the system somewhere. Check all your hoses and connections to make sure they are tight.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	If you replaced the coolant, you may have had an air pocket in the cooling system and didn't get it full.

p9ZrhJBqaa	Generally in automotive wiring red is positive black is negative general light add on  one wire is white or gray one is black or a black strip, and also you <br>  the light color wire is positive and darker or black strips are generally negative<br>  because the device has a plug for your lighter in the car that is already direct<br>  to your battery that way when you turn the car off  the light has continuous power inside that plug is a fuse if you get a power surge its trips the fuse blowing it out turns off the light you replace the fuse your back in biz.<br>  <br>  Now with the problem with what you want to do you want to cut that plug off and wire direct to your battery us mechanics love people like you your made of money and you have lots of it to repair the entire electrical system in your car let me tell you why.<br>  <br>  First of all you want to wire it directly to the battery there is no fuse to protect your electrical system in case of a surge which will fry the entire electrical system and if your lucky and there is anything left of your car<br>  after it catches on fire and burns to the ground you may be able to start either repair the entire electrical system or you just buy a new car cause you have lots of money and can afford it.<br>  <br>  By wiring directly to the battery that item will have direct power 24/7<br>  never shuts off one problem with that is unless your car is running your battery is not charging which means you should also either purchase a spare battery or one of those battery jumpers that have their own battery because when you park the car that light will be drawing amps up until the point your battery dies and now you need to jump it on a regular basis keep in mind that anything wired directly to the battery without an inline fuse is risked being fried in which case you will be bring it to me and on average at $60 an hr<br>  we love you.<br>  <br>  If you want to wire it directly to battery you will need to buy 12-14 gauge wire<br>  then you also need to buy a inline fuse it has two short wires coming out if a plastic housing for a fuse run a wire red from the battery on the end of that wire put the fuse wire the take the white or Grey wire to that fuse on the other side then take to other wire and either ground it to the metal body under a bolt now you have a light on 24/7 carry jumper cables or jumper box your going to need sooner or later or you can buy a simple switch in that case run red wire from battery to the fuse to the switch inside the care find a place to install the switch drill a hole pull wires thou hole one red wire on one side a black wire on the other side don't know were to ground find your stereo<br>  black wire and run black wire from switch black wire on stereo.<br>  keep in mind to disconnect the battery prior to running any wires to anything if you ground the positive wire you stand to lose your entire electrical system<br>  at 60 dollars an hr the only person who is going to be rich is me we love home mechanics that don't have a clue., by wiring it to a switch will enable you to turn the light off when you shut the car off that way you don't have amps drawing down your battery and will also save you from standing in front of your car with jumper cables in hand wondering what wrong with my battery nothing is wrong with the battery the problem is anytime you have things in your car drawing amps off the battery while the vehicle is off and parked you are running it down until its dead it will never just go away<br>  personally i have lots of neon lights in my car but i wired directly to a switch<br>  that way when shut my car off and turn my switches off there is no direct draw therefore i unlike you will not be standing in front of my car late for work with jumper cables in hand praying for some one to stop and give me a jump<br>  also you may consider that when you start hooking up neon to that car<br>  that the alternator will have to be up graded to a heavy duty because the manufacture of all cars do not put heavy duty alternators in because you may or may not hook up light the alternator and voltage regulators are for just the basics of the car. the more you hook up if your alternator is rated for lets say 200amps but your system load  from all your lights is 400 amps <br>  guess what your alternator will not have the amps to charge the battery<br>  let along run the power requirements for the vehicle and will over load the system and with out any fuses over load equals fire fire burns cars to the ground within 5 minutes. sorry for the long explain <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  LR|`|jYy6dDAZaa	The wire that went to the center post of the plug is Positive +.<br>   If they are colored Red is positive and black negitive.|`|WXDyS90Naa	If you're asking which one is positive, it is th one that goes to the center of the adapter.

The next bit requires a bit of thought, using 20mph as the base line, the braking distance is  equal to the speed in feet,i.e 20mph = 20 feet. as you increase your speed to 30mph , the braking distance is increased by 1.5 times your speed :<br>  <br>  20mph Thinking distance = 20 feet, braking distance = 20 feet. Overall stopping distance = 20 + 20 = 40feet<br>  <br>  30mph. Thinking = 30 feet, braking = 1.5  x 30 = 45feet. Overall stopping distance = 30 + 45 = 75 feet<br>  <br>  70mph. Thinking = 75 feet, braking 3.5 x 70 = 245feet. Overall stopping distance = 70 + 245 = 315 feet.<br>  <br>  It sounds complicated, but if you write it down, it is fairly easy.<br>  <br>  Remember, these are only approximate distances on good, dry roads, with a good braking system on the car. The overall stopping distance is controlled by other factors, weather, condition of road, car, age of driver etc|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Different for every car. But the ones published in the highway code are way outdated, by decades in fact. Every car on the road now will better them.<br>  <br>  But if you are refering to the ones in the highway code (i.e you are taking your theory test) the easiest way is<br>  <br>  20 x2 = 40 feet<br>  30 x2.5 = 75 feet<br>  40 x 3 = 120 feet<br>  50 x3.5 = 175 feet<br>  60 x 4 = 240 feet<br>  70 x 4.5 = 315 feet<br>  etc.....|`|IARYnu6zaa	I think its the same in meters as to what you're driving?<br>  So if you're going 20 mph, stopping distance is 20m?<br>  I'm not sure, google it.|`|XdBrjuRJaa	Thats bollocks because if you have got fast reflexes you can stop faster than ordanary people.
QeMiIL15aa	Although the lotus is not very pretty, it is much more dramatic. If you live in the U.S. it is also considered somewhat exotic. Depending on the generation, it also has a very good power/weight ratio. It is well known worldwide as being one of the best handling cars ever. It is very small and feels like a race car while you are driving one. Since it is a relatively rare car, you would probably get lots of questions about it from men and women alike. It is obviously made of top quality materials as most British cars are nowadays. Since it is a lotus, it also has decades or racing heritage also. Given its Toyota engine, it is also extremely reliable.<br>  <br>  The Audi TT is a small "sporty" car for girls|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	I have to say i dont really like either that much aesthetically but I would get a lotus if it were given to me and sell it for an audi and keep the rest lol. <br>  I really love Audi's and I can imagine how fast and fun the TT must be, but I really can't imagine myself in a Lotus. <br>  <br>  Actually a lot of people in CA have Lotus' and they look really funny on the road.

JEteneuUaa	Hey brother!<br>  Yeah you need to add in the details where you are from.<br>  I am from Miami so they are totally legal here. I smoked my ride out the only thing off set is the red accent on my rims. You made a good choice and your gonna turn heads.<br>  <br>  Suggestions? I suggest not ordering online unless they specifically say 08 Scion tC!!! Next Suggestion is just find what you like online and go to your local racer shop and have them order it online for you they will charge you a little extra but give you good installation and possibly free install at time of purchase. The pro to doing this is that they smoked cars out before and they might be able to get you a cheaper deal on some black covers for your lights from off line or whatever they have in stock.<br>  <br>  So with that said I hope your ride is hot and look for some tips on www.scionlife.com<br>  <br>  Take it easy!<br>  ShiX-|`|MExiWz7Zaa	idk<br>  it is illegal in some places..<br>  i was thinking about doing it but it would be hard for the passengers behind u..and if they wreck u then it ur fault|`|5JdOMK2iaa	I've used VHT night shades for my tail lights.

If you find out the displacement of the speakers which ever has the greatest displacement would be louder.|`|7ObGOaPPaa	I would go with the 15. in most trucks there isn't a whole lot of space for a subwoofer box, so it would be much easier to accomodate one 15 in its optimal ported enclosure, then it would to accomodate two 12's in their optimal ported enclosure. (ported is the way to go for loudness, and you need large boxes for the best results when porting.)<br>  <br>  but really either could be louder or sound better than the other. it just depends on the subwoofers, the amp you're using, and the box.

I would even recheck the head.   There are machine shop options, even if there is a crack.   Also, I would look into your boat insurance.   I've seen plastic bags blocking the water intake causing the overheat, which in turn caused the problem in the block.  Most often on I/O's.  I would also check with Volvo service, once you know what you have.  If the head was pulled, to rework, you can see the cylinder wall and the top of the piston.  I would be shocked that a "crack" could drop the compression that much without leaving something very obvious.  Drain the oil and pull the pan.  I have a digital camera trick I use.  You might not even have to take the engine out of the boat.  Take a bunch of photos as you rotate the crank....even drop the rod cap and tap the piston up.  It should be obvious whats wrong.

They may get to keep their home, But someone has to pay the 10 MILLION dollar cleanup bill and resolve the lawsuits that have resulted from this incident. My friend was Below the speed limit( About 50 MPH) On his designated route, In his own lane, doing exactly what he was supposed to be doing. He still has some health effects from the spill, but is still working. No one died! Or she would be doing time for vehicular manslaughter. All of this is in the court documents. The Judge himself told the girl she was lucky not to be spending most of the rest of her life in prison.

4agFELNzaa	As a current Canadian Forces Pilot, I went a different route than you but from where you are, I'm afraid you've made it a little more difficult for yourself. To be a pilot on the Canadian forces you have to have a university degree, any degree. You have to be a Canadian citizen or have landed immigrant status. You have to have 20/20 vision and be in good overall health. You will have to go to a recruiter (which you can find in the website below). From there you will have to:<br>  1. Do an aptitude test<br>  2. Have a medical performed<br>  3. Upon acceptance, go to air crew selection<br>  4. If you pass that you get offered a job as a pilot<br>  5. You have to complete your degree<br>  6. When you complete your degree you go to Preliminary Flight Training<br>  7. Followed by Basic Flight Training<br>  <br>  The best way to get information is to go talk to a recruiter in person, and they can give you information and options based on your current situation.<br>  <br>  I heard rumors that they are going to start accepting college pilots, but no guarantees. Just go and ask if you're serious about it.|`|AA11119924	You need to apply to and be accepted to the Canadian Air Force Academy. Your College degree is a plus but not a sure way in.

If you plan your passage based on 125 miles per day, you can make the trip in as little as 6 days.  If you choose to stop over anywhere, that will add to your time.

9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	This should help you...<br>  <br>  P Chamfer: This is a chamfer on the end of the pole, it helps to bring the air down around inside of the motor and helps cool the coil better. It also helps relieve the pressure underneath the dustcap. We recommend at the bare minimum to get this option if you choose this series of woofers.<br>  <br>  Cooling: Self explanatory, the cooling channels are machined into the inside of the sub to help cool the coil FAR better. But there are some things that you sacrifice. There is less metal inside of the motor so it is a little weaker. If you are looking for a fart/burp only scenario for SPL we suggest that you do NOT get this option. Stick with only the P chamfer. Now if you are looking for a daily sub to beat on and you have 2000+ watts the BTL series is for you.<br>  <br>  Flatwind: The flatwire coil option is standard in the BTL.<br>  <br>  HiXmCoil: This coil is simply much longer than the normal dual 1ohm or dual 2ohm flatwire coils and allows for more xmax. If you are using this in a daily scenario we suggest that you choose this option, especially in the 15 and 18 inch models.<br>  <br>  Inner Heat Sink: Its a machined aluminum ring in the gap that lowers the voicecoils inductance (allowing it to play up higher and have a little better overall transient response). It also reduces the volume inside the magnet gap of the motor increasing air speed with the cooling as well as allowing the coil to kick off heat to a more receptive thermal mass rather than magnets. <br>  <br>  Daily or SPL: Simply put, if you plan on listening to any type of music you MUST choose the daily option. If it is strictly for a fart/burp scenario then choose the SPL option. The reason we have these options is the gap tolerances between the two are different. The gap in the SPL woofer is much tighter and FAR less forgiving in comparison to the Daily option. The Daily option simply gives the coil more wiggle room inside of the gap to deal with the non-linearity tendancys that you can get into when you are using a sub in a daily driving scenario. Typically SPL applications deal with 1 note and it does not change, therefore we can make the gap much tighter and get all of the motor strength that we can out of it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Universal: This option gives you the choice to later chance the impedence of your voice coils. You can change from dual 2’s to dual 1’s and vice versa by reconing them. If you do not choose this option your motor(s) will be optimized per the coil resistance that you have chosen. (Dual 2’s will forever be a dual 2 motor, Dual 1 will forever be a Dual 1 motor).<br>  <br>  From <a href="http://www.soundsolutionsaudio.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=7153" rel="nofollow">http://www.soundsolutionsaudio.com/forum...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|uL5772kCaa	What they basically do is add more power handling to the subwoofer.

If you do that, you can easily hit your 300-350 horsepower number naturally aspirated! All you would need to do is go with some prepped Vortec heads, matching intake and a decent cam, and you'll be dead in the middle of your horsepower goal, all for less than the cost of a blower. <br>  <br>  However, I'll assume you have the blower on the cheap, or already bought it. You will be able to sustain the 5psi if you make sure your advance is dialed back properly (and I hope you not using a points distributor!) If you do have a points distributor, throw it and its resistance line on the trash and beg-borrow-trade for an HEI distributor at a minimum (you can get an Accel unit for fairly cheap). You'll need the extra spark power. On top of that, see if you can get an MSD unit on the cheap on eBay or the like. <br>  <br>  And you will have to go with a bigger carb than that Dualjet. <br>  <br>  Don't go for the "higher is better" philosophy with your combo - your gaskets will probably not like it!|`|82465d4152c317efc8046566296310d6aa	You would get more bang for the buck with a cam & heads.
dQUISy3Haa	Since you are buying it used, as with any used car, regardless of country of origin, you should have it checked out by a mechanic. The best $50-70 you may spend on a car. The common problems with this model as it gets up in age - Timing belt - it should be changed every 70 to 90,000 miles. Has this one been changed ? Front lower control arm bushings - if there is a knocking noise in the front suspension, these bushings are worn out. A knocking noise in the rear is the center pivot bushing worn out .

So if you bridge a SVC 4 ohm subwoofer, then each channel will see an ohm load of 2 ohms.<br>  <br>  The reason why you cant have a 2 ohm bridged load is because that will make the amplifier see a final ohm load of 1 ohm, and it looks like your amp is not stable at 1 ohm|`|AA11318686	Having a 2 ohm load on a bridged stereo amp would be the same as having a 1 ohm load on each channel of a 2 channel amp. and the only stereo amps that go down to 1 ohm per channel are Rockford Fosgate and Hifonics.

I have this problem cuz I have a DVD monitor in my dash and I have to look at the screen for the track list.  BUT, I only do it when stopped at a light.

ER docs are reporting a huge spike in injuries while texting and walking (walking into traffic, tripping, colliding with other people, falling down stairs, etc.).

Rwn0svq0aa	The single most important aspect of automotive safety are tires. The best that money can buy are the Michelin line of tires. They incorporate the best materials and have been on top of their game for quite sometime. My experience and the reputation of a Michelin tire is competent traction down to the tire cords. A lesser tire will loose wet weather traction when it is down to 4/10ths tread. My point here is that a Michelin will give you greater use as it wears when others lose their adhesive properties. The downside is that Michelins are expensive and they do not necessarily last longer, on balance overall performance is best in class.  <br>  A decent compromise is Falken tires. The science behind a Falken tire is not as advanced as the Michelin line, but they are a brand who has a good reputation and would be in the upper middle of the pack for quality and price. My experience is that Falkens wear well and are a good choice.  Goodyear has the familiar name we all know, but they are not putting out a good tire in the price range I am speaking of. The price range would be between $110 to $250 a tire.  Specifically, the Goodyear RSA tires for years have been the standard oem tire for the Mazda 3 and they are a terrible compromise. Dry weather traction is decent, but let it rain, snow; it is a dangerous proposition to depend on those tires going into a corner or accelerating on wet road.  You will hear about Kuhmo, Yokohama, Toyo and BF Goodrich tires. My opinion is that these tire companies specialize best in summer tires, they have decent product but nothing to rant or rave about. And of course you have experienced Bridgestone Potenza tires. My experience was premature wear on a Lexus GS 430, I would not buy a set again. Perhaps your experience was better than mine. Nevertheless, if you love someone and they are going to be in the car with you, get the best tire your money can afford.  It is that important. Cheers.|`|abnqs0jQaa	Depending on your price range and if you are just getting all-season tires, I have had great experience with Nokian, Yokohama, and I think the other (which I haven't had in ages) was Avon, but I might be mistaken on that last one.<br>  <br>  I had great success with some yokohama all season and summer tires on various types of vehicle, and the wear and handling were quite good.<br>  <br>  If you were to get a dedicated winter tire, Nokian Hakkapolieta (sp?) RSi tires are absolutely amazing. Living in New England, I was blowing by most other vehicles, including all wheel drive automobiles (with complete handling in tact) in my front wheel drive vehicle. They had astounding amounts of grip on slippery surfaces, and they have had exceptional longevity thus far. They make summer tires as well, but I can not attest to anything other than their winter tires.<br>  <br>  As for Michelin, I've had great success with their cycling tires, but their automotive tires wear out so quickly. I never am smoking the tires or anything and the three pairs I had all had the shortest lifespan of any tires I've owned. They also handled poorly in wintery weather, just in comparison to other All-season tires, not including the Nokians above. I'm sure their innovative and all, but I had no luck with their tires.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of good options out there, I'm sure you'll find a good set for the car.|`|Sksd55zeaa	Hi, if you want to get more information about it, go to <a href="http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/?q=Mazda%20Sports" rel="nofollow">http://car-insurance2009.synthasite.com/...</a>

Yq2CUhtYaa	I don't care if you down me. Stupidest threat I've ever heard.<br>  <br>  Anyway, pick up something like a Toyota Supra, 1986.5-1992.<br>  <br>  They're relatively low profile, since they're mid 80's cars. But still very sporty.<br>  They get decent gas mileage. Average of around 25+mpg.<br>  Insurance is low, because of their age.<br>  They're not a grandma car.<br>  And it's Toyota.<br>  And they cost about $4000 for a great condition one.<br>  <br>  That should basically match all your requirements.|`|e93659642a9147aad2a89d7b0a52ebddaa	Agreed with Vip.

Any newer generation Supras? The 93-98 model is my favorite car in the world.

Alignment can't cause steering to become that hard. Did you hit a curb or something? It could be a few things, and most of them aren't inexpensive to fix either. It could be dangerous as well, so better fix it NOW! Take it to a reputable shop.

lBH8j3mTaa	Here is a list of colleges and universities. Gleim is a trusted name. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gleim.com/aviation/links/schools.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.gleim.com/aviation/links/scho...</a><br>  <br>  Personally I would find a college you like and major in whatever you want, and get your licenses/ratings on the side through a flight school, and not a flight school that has special programs like a 90 day whatever bla bla bla. Especially if they want all the money up front.<br>  <br>  Go to a flight school at your own pace, not some fast paced cookie cutter crap. All these quick flight schools take your money in the beginning o the program and you are just a number to them. Go to your local airport or somewhere close to whatever college you like and talk to some pilots. Ask the reputations about the local flight schools. Then you talk to the flight schools and meet some instructors, when you start your training at a local flight you should have no more than two or three instructors the whole way. You get to know who they are and they get to know who you are, its a rewarding experience for both of you, and they can teach to your style of learning.<br>  <br>   You will learn more through a regular local flight school and you will be a better pilot. All of these other fast track schools will get you the ratings quickly, but I guarantee you will not be as good or as knowledgeable a pilot. Just my two cents. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

Also, is the car cranking but not turning over, or running for a little and then going off?  Need some answers before telling you what is wrong.<br>  <br>  If you can turn it, but it won't fire.  Or if it starts up, but goes off, then it's the rotor and coil.  Could be many things...<br>  <br>  Just from low oil... doubt it.  If so, it's easy, so just fill it up and see if the car starts.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Possibly.<br>  <br>  Fuel injected vehicles usually have the fuel pump and oil pressure gauge on the same circuit.<br>  <br>  If the oil pressure drops far enough, the engine shuts off.<br>  <br>  That piece of ingenuity has probably saved quite a few vehicle owners from themselves.|`|Lu9HbywHaa	No doubt it. Just because a car is low on oil won't effect anything that is electrical. Whenever your low on oil the computer will sense it and on the cluster there will be a low oil light that is on. The reasons why the distributor will stop firing is if the ignition coil is burnt out or the ignition rotor is burnt. Also if the wires are corroded that may be a possibility.
