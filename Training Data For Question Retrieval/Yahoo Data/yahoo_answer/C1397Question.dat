20090308091338AAAtpGr	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why does my friend call my guy more than she calls me?	She and him go to the same school (right by where we live), apparently. So they run into each other pretty often. But why the hell is she calling him at 11 and 12 at night some nights? She has a tendency to exclude me from things intentionally or unintentionally. Like, she and the rest of the "crew" tend to go out to parties and stuff, and they tell me nothing about it. Even when she tags along with me and this guy I'm seeing, she doesn't call me about it. And now he'd tell me like "yeah, she called me...I don't know why, I didn't pick up."      She doesn't even call ME that much. So why the hell is she calling him? Even if she called him to invite the both of us somewhere, I don't understand why she's calling him (just met him like 2 months ago) and not me (just met 12 years ago). What do you think?

Someone how is fond of poetry but never actually tried writing any goes on a hiking trip with a group of friends and gets lost and sleeps the night alone in a cave. He becomes so frightened and starts to see things that don't exist, then he sees someone who helps him and tells him he is a poet. He continues seeing this guy how tells him beautiful poems and at the end he discovers that this person doesn't exist and finds out that he is the one how is creating these poems.

20090308093534AASf63h	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	How to deal with my son and daughter?	My 12-year-old son and my 13-year-old daughter generally get along pretty well, but they do like to tease each other from time to time. My son, believing for some reason that it’s cute or funny, will sometimes give his sister a “titty twister” or hit her on her breasts, which are just developing. I dont think he does it to be cruel but rather as I said he finds it cute or funny, as a way to tease her.       I’ve attempted to deal with this by taking away some of his privileges and by talking with him about how sensitive a girl’s breasts are. I’ve really tried to convey that to him, even likening a girl’s breasts to his balls. Each time, he seems to listen and seems to respond well, and he even apologizes to her and it always sounds like he means it - but then a few days or a few weeks later he is back at it.      Anyway, my daughter, God bless her, doesn’t like to tattle on her brother. As I mentioned, they have a pretty good relationship, for brother and sister. She approached me today (presumably after he did it again, although she wouldn’t say), and she asked me this question: The next time he does it, could she give him a taste of his own medicine by giving him a kick in the balls (not too hard)? I said that I would think about it and would talk with her later.       Naturally, it would pain me to see my son get booted in the berries so to speak, but I really sympathize with my daughter in this situation. Since I have tried taking away privileges and tried talking with him (all to no avail), I’m leaning toward giving her the green light to give him a taste of his own medicine.       I’m looking for your views on 1) whether I should give her permission fr her to do it; and 2) assuming I give her that permission, whether I should be on the sidelines, so to speak, to make sure nothing gets out of hand.

20090308095112AATe42f	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What does it mean when you have a dream about someone that's passed away but you dont actually see that person?	My brother passed away 6 years ago and i do have dreams about him from time to time but I just had a dream about him that freaked me out a little. In the dream i wake up and ask my mom where he is and she tells me that he found out that he was going to pass away so he ran away from home and there's no point of looking for him cause hes gonna die anyways. I go looking for him anyways and i look around the house and i see my neighbour on the front lawn with her grandson who looks just like my little brother when he was a toddler, i think its him and I tell him to come home and the lady tells me thats not my brother. So I go back to my house and I'm standing outside and this dog comes up to me and says he wants to help me find my brother. I say thanks but I have to clean my room first, let me do that quickly and then i'll come. and the dog says ok but hurry because I have the password for the park and I think your brother is there. And that's when I wake up. This dream really freaked me out, does anyone know what it might mean, I never see my brothers face in the entire dream, except for that kid that looks like him, but nothing of what he looked like at his latest age...

20090308095845AA4WBsH	Social Science;Psychology	Crazy situation... Please read the story and help me.....?	So my story is:     I live in Romania. My family is not very rich, but they paid me a wow subscription. I played wow the last summer, but my social life got to be something I hated. All day I was playing wow. So i decided to quit. Done. Then, I started going outside with my friend with our low-quality mountain bikes. We liked cyclism so we decided to start learning tricks. We started to jump over things and on ramps. Then we decided to buy BMX'es. They were pretty expensive, so our parents told us to wait. As a 14 year old boy, i couldn't earn money, so I said "ok, I'll wait". Then, the financial crysis came up and our parents told us they're not gonna buy us bikes after all. So we started riding our old bikes again. The bikes broke, as they were low-quality and cheap. With my last money a bought a skateboard. I spent 40$ dollars, or 120 lei in our currency. The skate was ok, I liked it. But it's bearings broke, and now it's almost good for nothing.  Then I decided to start free running, or parkour, a popular sport in my city. But I was affraid to do those tricks, like backflips and big jumps. So I left that. Now, I'm lost. No wow, no bike, no skate.....   My family won't give me money for other things....At least in the next 4 or 5 months. I can't live without something to do. My life without something to do is boring. I don't want stay all day and do nothing besides school. Anyone knows what should I do? Sorry for my bad English. Please answer. Thanks.

20090308101658AAtpLVR	Social Science;Economics	I need everybody's opinion on this?	here's my situation.      i have tennis elbow real bad. i've had it for about 3 yrs now but in the past few months, the pain has gotten unbearable.      i've already been in and out of physical therapy twice and have had 3 cortizone shots and neither worked. so i went to the doctor and told him that i think it's time for surgery and he agreed.      but the problem is it's a workmen's comp issue and it has to go through approval which takes about 2 weeks to get. so i have to work in the meantime.      my job is very physical and requires alot of use of that arm. so having to work with this bad elbow is like torture but my job insists that i work 7 days a week.      they know my predicament and they know i'm in severe pain but they don't care. when i try to explain it to them that i'm in pain, they kinda brush my off with the "suck it up and stop whining" attitude.      now here's the worst part. meanwhile, i'm watching able bodied people getting days and weekends off and getting sent home early due to lack of work. but for me, instead of sending me home on slow days, they look for trivial things for me to do. doing "lighter" jobs is actually worse because it requires more movement and use of this arm.      am i in the wrong for being angry about this?

20090306232700AAe9a0h	Social Science;Anthropology	Are Homo Sapiens rly supreme when compared with other human-like groups from the past such as the Neanderthals?	Well, or else why are we the only ones to survive? I know that Homo Sapiens are the only ones to survive to the modern days Homo Sapien Sapiens rite? Then how about the other human-like civilizations that are not really genetically related to us? I mean the ones which wouldn't have eventually evolved into Homo Sapiens Sapiens but something else?      There was the theory about the survival of the fittest, well are we the fittest among them?      Or are we just mentally more intelligent and out-smarted them in major past conflicts? Cus humanoids such as the Neanderthals are said to have survived in extreme cold conditions, I know they had a bigger face (Eyebrows, noes, mouth) that represent apes a little more then us(Perhaps that's just becus they ain't fully evolved yet). But then many scientists claims that they had storky bodies that are naturally allot more muscular than us, well, is that true?      So, what if you pick a modern human, and a Neanderthal, and have a fair and nuetral, unbaised MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) coach or sumthin' to train them both into UFC fighters or so, then pit them both in a cage- fight?       Lol I ain't being cruel alrite, But then, seriously, who will win?       I also wish to compare other humans or other future human civilizations though I just don't know all their names.      As a result, are we actually getting more intelligent but physically weaker during evolution? BUT, there had been real proof suggesting that the people in the 21st century (Modern world) is way better than the people living in the 18th- 19th century allot more in sports and Olympic performances due to environment, not regarding pollution, but we are economically more advance and have more advantages due to the resources we have? Notice that we ARE breaking records each year...?      Anyway, perhaps in the far future, after a nuclear war or somethin' (Which we hope that doesn't occur or else us humans had not learnt history), if some of us manages to survive, we may evolve radiation shielding skin and stuff like that, cus the body- built would need to adapt, and these genes would almost definatley be inherited by the next generations..."And when I say radiation shielding I don't mean we grow human-sized croacrotch shells behind all of our backs..."- LOL!

Among my circle of friends, I seem to be the only one who's afraid of the future.      I'm in college majoring in architecture.  My parents are inches from foreclosure, and my mom has lost her job twice in a year.  My dad's hours were cut so that he can't work more than 3 days a week.  My mom drained her retirement to pay for me and my sister's college tuition, and to pay the mortgage.  I know desperate situations call for desperate measures... and I know my parents have made huge mistakes financially.        I'm scared that my parents will be homeless in a few months.  There's been a role reversal between me and my mom, so that she comes to me when her marriage is on the rocks, or when she needs a pep talk before applying to a job.  It's too much for me to handle on my own.  I can't register for classes because I owe tuition.  If my parents have to move back home to Maryland (to live with my mom's parents), I'll have to chose between going to school there or staying in Ohio alone - if I move, my boyfriend of two years will be left behind.      I have no one to talk to about this.  Are any of you guys out there struggling, too?  How are you coping?  Do you have any suggestions?

20090306230412AA21DP4	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	A question for women only: your thoughts on p*nis size?	Okay, it's pretty aparent that size does, to at least some extent, matter.  Any guy who would argue obviously is either insecure about his own size or has been told by women that he was "fine" or "okay" and so he interpreted that as meaning "size doesn't matter".        So, how would you rate size on your list of "important sexual stuff"?  Is it number one, is it somewhere in the middle, is it pretty low on the list?  What?      I think alot of guys are wanting to know this and some are afraid to ask.  I say, let the truth come out!  So to speak... ;-)      What are your initial reactions to small, average, and large p*nis sizes?  Do you expect smaller men to be less good and larger men to be better?  Do you not judge at all, waiting to see how he "uses it"?  What runs through your mind when you first see a guy for the first time?      I know there are alot of quesiton marks here, but there are alot of questions I feel should be addressed.  So ladies, please state your HONEST thoughts/beliefs/opinons on p*nis size.  Also, girth seems to feel better than length, so is that more important?  Are they equally important?  Please share as much as possible.        I'm putting this in many different categories because there doesn't seem to be a "best" category for this Q.....      Thank you :D

20090306220938AApTvrY	Social Science;Psychology	How do I cure my apathy?	Over the past while I've been feeling rather apathetic toward life. Emotionless. There's no passion, no excitement, no extreme happiness, but no sadness either. It's as if my emotions have flatlined. What could be causing this, and how do I cure it?      Note that I haven't experienced any recent tramautic events and I'm not on anything. The most likely cause I'm thinking is lack of sleep and being overwhelmed at having to keep up with the constant social developments and trying to get ahead in my social life (I'm fairly introverted). Maybe it's something more serious? Please help.

It is called equality my friends.  No need to be alarmed.  This is my   Rated R question of the day.  Some White Women always brag   about how they use Black Men for sex and stuff.  Now help me out   here if I am wrong.  Some Black Men brag about how they use   White Women for money.  I mean both aspects are basically a sign of   immaturity,  and insecurity.  Trying to use someone for their own   personal gain.   This happens on a regular basis,  and for some it is   a way of life.   Once you give something to someone,  and do not ask   for it back in return.  Then the situation is valid,  and you cannot   bame the other party for anything.  Because you offered it to them,   in the first place.  White Women use Black Men for sex.  AND Black   Men use White Women for money.  Is this a fair exchange................

20090308102038AAERs95	Social Science;Psychology	I'm 18 and I miss being and feeling young, Are these feelings normal?	You might be saying I'm crazy, that how could I not like the freedoms of being older and I'm not saying I don't. However, when your young you feel special (if you had nice supportive family members) Now I'm not saying I grew up in a perfect house hold but I miss certain aspects of being young.      Take for example in Elementry school I'll never forget that girl who swooned over me when she saw me like I was dreamy. I've never had a GF in my life and now that Im older no girl thinks I look all-that... Oh the pleasures of looking young...      Now I have to constantly put things on my face like Clearasil to keep my face looking presentable and not full of pimples and oil. Ah, the good 'ol days when I was young I did nothing and I had a far better looking face then I do today.       I remember being able to run more freely without my feet hurting, feet pain was something I don't even remember feeling when I was young...       Of course there are advantages to the current day, Like I was nowhere near as intelligent as I am today still, the careless happy go-lucky free version of myself is long missed.... Now I live my days in boredom and sadness.... in my young days I lived each day with wonder and imagination....      I think what I miss most of all though is my good looks. What happened? Then again I think I missed more my mindset when I was young: I never thought about looks, I never compared my looks to anyone else, it never crossed my mind once for my mind was probaly to simple and carefree to realize such an area..      Why does every guy around me have either nice looking skin, a nice body, more muscle then me, i mean the list is endless. I find it hard to believe that 1 in 4 Americans are overweight I rarely see any overweight people at my school the good majority are in shape.       Yes, my friends, yes.... I feel old and ignored.....

20090307002731AAfWDun	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Why do I keep on having the  same dream?	Ok for the past few nights I keep on realizing I'm dreaming while I'm dreaming and I'm like "well this is creepy I might as well just wake up now" and so I dream that I wake up and fall asleep again and it happens again and again until I finally wake up and while I'm waking up I feel like my body is like shaking and heating up as I'm actually coming into conscience...and last night I dreamt that I woke up but my teeth hurt sooo bad and my whole body hurt and I limped to the kitchen and it was 5am and I was a mess  and I tried to ask my dad "Do I look disoriented????" because I wanted to ask if I could stay home from school but I couldn't talk. Then I went back to bed and fell asleep and then I actually woke up          Why does this keep on happening every night? It's really creepy when I keep on waking up and falling back asleep in my dream over and over and when it happens I just want it to stop and I just want to actually wake up....

20090308093148AAmcxhd	Social Science;Psychology	I keep dreaming of my dead father in law, that I have never met him!?	I keep having dreams about my dead father in law, I have never met him cause he died 2 years before me & my husband got together. I have only seen pictures of him & heard stories about him. I have 2 children he never met cause he died before they where born. I always dream that he is with us watching, playing, holding & crying with my children. My husband told me when we found out I was pregnant with our first born that his father told him one time that "I don't want to die without seeing my grandchildren." I dream of him as if he where alive & with us, as if he was there in human form. Why do I keep dreaming of somebody I have never met? Is he trying to tell me something? Or what?

20090227105907AABOZY2	Social Science;Psychology	Is there any good ways to stop yourself from sleeping too much?	I tend not to lie in too much and set my alarm everyday, but I find that after I do anything I come home and find it really hard not to fall asleep. I'm a student so lots of my time is taken up by reading...which is a very static activity and I find I fall asleep and wake up about 2-3 hours later.   My diet is quite good, although I've always had slightly poor digestion and find that eating big meals also makes me very tired after wards.   I have to admit I don't do loads of exercise, but do walk most days, although again will often find myself napping after wards!   If I get 10 hours sleep at night then I'm usually a bit better during the day, but not certainly.   I know a routine with no more than 8 hours sleep is supposed to be good for you, but I've tried that and I'm still knackered all day!   I was wondering if there was any vitamins I might be lacking, or other good ways to combat this without resorting to a ton of coffee!    I sleep very deeply at night, and usually find I'm out within 5 minutes of lying down, so I don't think its poor quality night sleep that's the problem.

I ask this question because i was riding the bus on my way home from work yesterday and there was a group a guys on the bus that were around my age (27) and they were on the bus laughing and calling me ugly.  I was not doing anything wrong to them at all.  I was just sitting on the bus minding my own business.      I am black and black people will literally tell you to your face that you are ugly and they do not care if it hurts your feelings or not.  I have never been called ugly before by anyone of another race.  I get called this alot from people of my own race.

Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom Shaitan has prostrated by (his) touch does rise. That is because they say, trading is only like usury; and Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury. To whomsoever then the admonition has come from his Lord, then he desists, he shall have what has already passed, and his affair is in the hands of Allah; and whoever returns (to it)-- these arc the inmates of the fire; they shall abide in it.

I'm just saying that you have got to get in a the faces of the people you feel are mistreating you, and you have to do it in numbers. Women just aren't as aggressive as men. (Don't rip me a new one for writing this. It's true. Just look at sports.) And men respect power and numbers. As it stands right now, how many people give feminism a second thought. A sea of chicks demanding equality would make a big difference.

Ok,this is about so called provocative dressing..      Women say they put on such dresses bcoz it makes them feel good.Men say that women dress provocatively as to lure attention.      Of course others attitude matters to women and thatz why they want to feel good in front of others,isn't it?But at the same time,they don't want to be eve-teased..How is that possible.?We cannot change the attitude of random men on the street,so isn't it better to take care by dressing modestly( and oh yeah,don't jump to the extremes of relating modesty to Afghan women) There is something called moderation-in between slutty dress and those burkhas..         Also,do you think women should excercise the freedom of expression more responsibly ,rather than just misusing it..      thanks for your time  and Good day to all

20090227112024AAbYDza	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Can't Move on and accept my life, can't be happy...?	I must have posted this question a hundred times. I am obsessive, I am depressed- I can't get through this. What is wrong with me?   This is my post-   Hey Everyone. Sorry that this is so long, but it’s been bothering me and I have to get it off my chest, and see what people’s opinions are so hopefully I can put my mind to rest. Here is my story as I best remember it and as truthfully as possible. About a year and a half ago I got drunk at a bar with a friend of mine. Sometime while he was up and away or after he left, I was sitting on a patio with a woman about my age (21) and I wanted to make a move on her, so I kissed her ( it must have lasted for a few seconds, and I tried sort of using the tongue, but I am still rather timid and pulled away after a bit so it’s not like I really have her a chance to respond to it) . She didn’t say anything or ask me to stop, she seemed fine with it, maybe a bit surprised at most. Later I put my hand down her pant and touched her bottom , though as we were both sitting down so I don’t think I got down too far ( not that I was trying to, I’m not sure what I was thinking other than I was an idiot.)   She never asked me to stop or seemed disrupted ( after all, if someone just leans over, kisses you full on with tongue and all, you’d say something right?, and then I’m sure if she had a problem with my touching she’d of said something.) anyways, when my friend came back and went to leave, some of her friends ( she was with others- she was not alone) said I should leave with him ( because he was asking me to walk home with him) but I wanted to stick around to talk with this woman. At the time I thought that they wanted me to leave with him just to be nice to the poor lad ( after all, I abandoned the poor guy for a 20 minute walk home - and yes, I have apologized profusely for my behaviour to him as well that night.) Later on in the night, I was walking, about to leave when a girl starting talking to me and said something along the lines of ‘hey, weren’t you the one who tried to stick your tongue down my friend’s throat?’ I was offended by her way of saying the question,   More than half a year ago, I remembered this event and it started bothering me. Did this woman feel violated by my actions? Did I sexually assault someone? I became very harsh on myself and forgot to remember that it was a stupid thing I had done- but I didn’t force her to, and I would have stopped had she asked me to. I have been obsessive about the event and I am now taking meds for my depression. Though the meds have helped and my quality of life is returning, the questions still bother me - Is this woman alright? What if she had never kissed someone before and I violated that for her? Will I ever accept myself and be able to forgive myself and move on? I would never do something to hurt or violate another person, and I feel like I’ll never be able to fully forgive myself.   At the height of my depression I did not want to live and considered myself the worst, most vile scum on the planet, but I am starting to come around to realize I made an honest mistake and didn’t mean any harm
20090227112949AAlwtGz	Social Science;Psychology	Do you feel bad to have killed a creature ?	Heads up.....i may not be a complete believer of non-violence but not against it too ......i am a non-vegetarian and love my KFC bucket,,,,,,,I am agnostic.....      So heres it...I some times feel very very bad about hurting a creature, although its been more often than never by accident......like today i was filling water in can to put in the fridge .....and when i a was wiping the water of the can's exterior.....i saw an ant at the top near the lid...and before i realized it, i had killed it.....this creature(creationof god or nature) which had survived all the hardships was really at the wrong place at the wrong time......i could have blown it off ...but i didnt....and now its dead......i feel there are somethings other than me which will miss it tonight......a hungry queen or/and fellow colleagues.......perhaps a brother or sister or a loved one or all of them.......There is a sect similar to Buddhism but just more hardlined and called Jainism ......they cover their mouth with a cloth....so that they don't kill any germs accidentally by inhaling them ......I am not that ardent ......So i don't pay much attention  to that......But the fact that i could have prevented its death in case of the ant or similar situations....makes me feel bad.......   Am I being too sentimental ?   Can what i experience be called Humanity?(i would love it if you can define it too....)   And Do you feel bad for similar things, what would they be?   Please leave all Theological and Agnostic or Atheist implications aside and answer.....i would really appreciate it.....Thanks a gazillion for everyone who honestly tries to answer considering all these points......

20070306183119AAY7ysb	Social Science;Psychology	Reasoning behind displacement of anger/hatred?	Displacement is a psychological defense mechanism in humans which refers to a person taking his anger out on another [who was not responsible for the anger in the first place, though may or may not have escalated it]. For example, your dad pisses you off, but you don't retaliate, instead you kick your dog for stress relief. This probably causes violent crimes which victimize random, innocent people. The question is, why do people insist on hurting others rather than the ones who "deserve" to be hurt? Is it more satisfying or what?
