6xukUWsqaa	Vi una nota en univision hace tiempo, acerca de los cosmeticos caros y los economicos, lujo y comerciales, maybelline es comercial, y el profesional que explicaba decia que no habia diferencia, que eran semejantes, todo estaba en tu capacidad para usarlos, los de lujo son caros, por la publicidad que se les hace, el lugar en el que se venden, esto aumenta mucho su valor, mas no siempre esta dado por la calidad. A mi me cayeron mal las cremas Lancome, pero las de oil of olay me sirvieron bien...en fin..suerte!|`|BBkDWzquaa	sabes algo los maybelline son iguales que esos de marca todo es promocion. te los recomiendo yo los uso y son economicos .|`|hneJqPD3aa	claro que es una buena marca... ofrece calidad, precio  y toda una gama de tonos, colores y productos...    si es muy buena! saudos y buen da...|`|W8pNbUCoaa	son buenos, sobre todo los labiales, y los rimen los labiales , todos los q salgan de esa marca son buenos en realidad esta marca es super buena, asi q te la recomiendo y no da?a la piel q es lo mas importante.  suerte  adios|`|7501d12ba93b86c0ce9a288a73e347d2aa	a mi no me han causado problemas al contrario me han funcionado bien, recuerda que caro no significa calidad.|`|cO4uYxLUaa	No te los recomiendo usa Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder o Elizabeth Arden. son perfectos.|`|TXuKLZIBaa	los productos son muy buenos es una de las marcas que compr Lreal,yo uso el embellecedor de pesta?as y el labial indeleble que sac hace poco.Para m el de pesta?as es el mejor , he probado otros muy preistigiosos y no me dieron resultado.|`|FlkdiLRWaa	En lo particular lo nico q me usta de esta marca son los water shine liquid diamonds y los labiales hydra extreme, mas nada! no creo q sea muy buena, no es hipoalergnica, sus productos para el rostro no contienen FPS, y por ninguna parte dice q no obstruyen los poros.... no confo en maybelline..
AA11902003	Lo que debes hacer para cerrar tus poros es exfoliarlos. Normalmente lo que haces es mojar la cara con agua caliente para q estos se abran y entre mejor la crema exfoliadora  el jabn exfoliador. Luego te la lavas con bastante agua fra para cerrarlos, y poco a poco se irn cerrando. Puedes averiguar trambin de alguna crema q los cierre. Ahora, para las manchas lo que mas recomiendo es la vitamina A, pues acelera el cambio de piel y quita las manchas. Una opcin es:  Este frmaco es en base a vitamina A, se llama "Retin- A" sirve para producie exfoliacin en la piel e ir desprendiendo poco a poco la piel como un peeling. Es en crema de 40g, y depende del estado (leve o moderado 0.05%) y (muy avanzado o para estras 0.1%). Evita tomar el sol al aplicar esta crema, aplcatelo por las noches luego de lavarte la cara con un jabn neutro o especial para acne.  No se si lo tienen en tu pas pero busca algo similar. As mismo, puedes bucsar que te hagan peeling o usar laser.|`|QywUCODmaa	Lo ms importante es la hidratacin, bebe bastante agua y utiliza cremas hidratantes para la cara y para el cuerpo. Las hay para pieles con tendencia grasa, que no favorecen la aparicion de granos.    Siempre desmaqullate antes de acostarte, pues los restos de maquillaje estropean mucho la piel.    Aunque seas morena, protgete del sol, ya que este es el principal causante de las manchas y reseca mucho la piel.     Y si sigues teniendo dudas sobre como cuidar tu piel, lo mejor es volver a ir al dermatlogo.

Comunque, alla tua et, potresti anche non truccarti, sei giovanissimissima! Se proprio ci tieni cmq metti solo un po'di gloss sulle labbra (MAI il rossetto, sembreresti una bambina truccata da adulta), correggi le imperfezioni con un po'di correttore e un fondotinta leggero (evita il mascherone o la terra che ti fa sembrare color mattone!), un po'di mascara e basta.   A me, per esempio, piace moltissimo la matita nera, ma su una ragazzina della tua et non ce la vedo affatto...|`|DB4DlHhnaa	Io mi metto semplicemente una matita nera waterproof all'interno dell'occhio e il mascara trasparente sulle ciglia che le tiene in ordine ma non appesantisce troppo..niente ombretti, fard e fondotinta..al massimo solo un po' di lucidalabbra..cosi sarai sempre in ordine in modo semplice senza esagerazioni..|`|aAmliZ16aa	Il trucco pesante non dona ad un viso giovane come il tuo.   Usa fondotinta in tonalit simili al colore della tua pelle (provalo nell'incavo del polso x trovare il colore giusto)  Evita fard o terra abbrozzante.  Per gli occhi potresti limitarti al mascara (ne esistono anche di trasparenti che definiscono ma nn colorano) o al massimo utilizzare ombretti chiari, perlati...ce ne sono di bellissimi  Per le labbra: lucidalabbra chiari, trasparenti  Hai 13 anni...fra un po' di tempo potrai osare combinazioni pi ardite..adesso aspetta!!!  Mi raccomando: struccati sempre la sera prima di andare a letto!!!!!!!|`|jsK4P83Vaa	come  difficile truccarsi di meno?? Vabb.. Se proprio non riesci prova a truccarti un giorno si e un giorno no... Oppure mettiti solo il necessario: fondotinta, se lo metti, matita e mascara...|`|0VOt89iRaa	sei talmente giovane che non hai bisogno di truccarti tanto. Per andare a scuola ti basta un lucida labbra, un p di mascara, un velo di fard per dare colore e al massimo un p di correttore se hai qualche brufoletto che non vuoi far notare.   Nelle "occasioni" invece puoi usare anche un p di ombretto ma di colore chiaro. Ricordati sempre di struccarti e che il miglior trucco  un sorriro!|`|ecHdqEzlaa	ma che ti trucchi a fare a 13 anni sei carina cos...per tutti i giorni non truccarti, magari solo 1 burrocacao colorato o gloss. per quando esci metti un pochino di ombretto iridescente, che nn si vede il colore ma brilla soltanto, un po' d matita nera dentro l'occhio (ma anke senza), mascara e gloss. ciao!|`|aLreQLERaa	Prima di uscire di casa chiedi ai tuoi genitori se vai bene.. di solito non gli va mai bene  sempre troppo.|`|C474f5MEaa	out il nero x favore  un colore pesantissimo per la tua et!! (poi sta moda emo  terribile), ombretto con i brillantini o perlato assolutamente no. V benissimo un p di matita marrone, nn pesante, e un ombretto bicolore in due sfumature una carne e l'altra di un beije-bruno da stendere chiaro interno palpebra scuro esterno in modo da dare pi profondit all'occhio senza appesantirlo. Occhio devi sfumare un modo armonioso i colori. Il phard pu andare bene, se ha un colore molto fresco un pesca o un rosa chiaro. no a illuminanti e glitter. il correttore si usa prima del fondotina per eliminare occhiaie segni e imperfezioni della pelle (vd Piccoli brufoli), il fondotinta deve essere della tua stessa carnagione e v steso con la spugna (nn a chili) su tutto il viso, compreso collo e orecchie, se vuoi che nn si crei l'effetto lucido puoi usare dopo il ft un p di cipria in polvere. + un p di mascara molto leggero...|`|OBXy00Bmaa	inizia cn un fondotinta ke si avvicini il piu possibile alla tua tonalit ...applica del phard rosa o marrone(dipende dalla tonalit della tua pelle) iniziando dal centro delle guance e andando verso fuori mantenendoti sugli zigomi..applica un p di matita nera o marrone all'interno dell'okkio senza avvicinarti troppo all'angolo interno ( dv vi  la ghiandola lacrimale) cm ombretto usa le varie sfumature del rosa o del marrone applicandone una tonalita chiara sulla parte mobile della palprebra e una un p piu scura sulla parte sotto le sopracciglia metti un p di mascara .. e sulle labbra un p di gloss trasparente...il risultato sar molto naturale!! spero di esserti stata utile =)  http://picnic.ciao.com/fr/50514100.jpg  ti consiglio qst ombretti della l'oreal si kiamano color appeal trio pro!!  ps: niente ombretti cn brillantini!!

L'operazione la potrai fare solodopo i 25 anni e comunque quando ti si sar stabilizzata la vista...

Tua citazione:  le ragazze che conosco io che hanno fatto pallavolo per non troppi anni sono tutte uguali  che la tua amica  bella lo dici tu  dovresti spiegare com'   e la danza da i difetti che ho detto prima  e molti altri  Ma ciccio svegliati, dimmi se per esempio rossella brescia  da buttare via...ma cos', sei un feticista della pallavolo??? svegliati, le ragazze non sono tutte uguali, quindi uno sport non pu rendere tutte uguali...NESSUNO SPORT RENDE UGUALI se io faccio step mi vengono dei polpacci da calciatore, lo fa una mia amica e non ottiene il mio risultato.Sei di coccio, eh??  Ok togliti le fette di salame dagli occhi e poi ne riparliamo. Non c' peggior sordo di chi non vuol sentire...forse ho capito stavi con una che ti ha mollato per la danza|`|YDp3pmW6aa	ma va'!le hai lette su topolino ste cose? la pallavvolo sviluppa incredibilmente i muscoli di tutto il corpo e col tempo,come negli altri sport del genere,si indeboliscono i tendini(come ad esempio nel calcio),mentre la danza(quella classica)tende a sviluppare i muscoli delle gambe,per via dei movimenti tesi e delle punte,e dopo tantissimi anni si indeboliscono le caviglie.|`|Qrkb7Aobaa	chi te l'avrebbe dette ste cose????dimmi dove le hai sentite,senno' non ti credo!e comunque qualsiasi tipo di sport fa bene...|`|qLGif8rQaa	nn  prp vero. io ho un fisico bellissimo (nn lo dico io ma me lo dicono) sn alta 175 e peso 54 kili e ho ftt sl un anno pallavolo. invece la mia migliore amica ke fa pallavolo da qnd  nata nn ha affatto un bel fisico e poi conosco anke le sue amike d pallavolo e nn sn tt alte e magre, nonostante facciano pallavolo da un sacco d tempo.|`|upAUP2WVaa	Tutti gli sport fanno un bel fisico.. a patto che tu hai gi una buona base di tuo.

Qualunque sport, se fatto bene, fa metter su un bel fisico.    E riguardo al nuoto, io l'ho fatto per otto anni, e ho intenzione di ricominciare a farlo... e non ho affatto una schiena enorme. Tutto dipende dal livello di esagerazione con cui si fanno le cose, cos come per la danza.    Mi spiace caro, dovrai fidarti e basta... posso assicurarti che ho delle spalle normalissime, come le mie amiche che fanno danza, pallavolo o ginnastica. Non trattandosi di una cosa a livello agonistico,  naturale che modelli solo il corpo, senza sviluppare al massimo i muscoli, come tutto del resto...  Poi se non vuoi credermi fai te, a me non cambia nulla eh XD|`|P36BYIzTaa	Sciocchezze, io ho fatto pallavolo per 5 anni...e non ho un bel fisico!!|`|RDwAXB1Waa	pallavolo ci farebbe delle spalle grosse cos... il nuoto  il migliore!|`|M73RzJrNaa	ahahahha...e tu ki saresti x dire qste cs??

Pallavolo  l'unico sport che odio! Pur essendo bravina...   l'unico sport che non far mai ahah  Lo sport che mi ha fatto il fisico che ho ora  stato pattinaggio... e ne vado fiera!!          "a kyart    non hai le gambe grosse che fanno quasi tutt'uno con il sedere che poi di suo  allungato verso il basso dove solo l compare una piccola curva?    e le spalle triangolari?    e altre deformazioni della schiena?    oltre ai troppi muscoli sulle gambe che le rendono quasi a tubo?"    No guarda ho un fisico giustissimo...  Sono 85x60x88  E avendo solo quasi 17 anni direi che va bene no?  Sono 1.66 e peso 53 kg -_-  Il mio sedere  penso l'unica cosa che mi piace di me perch me l'hanno sempre esaltato tutti/e. Poi non so giudicarmi molto da sola...  Deformazioni alla schiena direi proprio di no.  E ho delle belle gambe.    Insomma non dico di essere perfettissima per nessuno ha mai commentato in negativo il mio corpo quindi sono abbastanza fiera di me... anche se come tutte le donne che si fanno schifo etc anche io cambierei tante tante cose di me.    E poi scusa non credo che esistano persone che hanno la parte superiore a partire dalla vita pi lunga di quella delle gambe!  La mia parte di sotto  nettamente pi lunga scusa... ma di almeno 35 cm!        A parte che pattinaggio l'ho smesso anni e anni fa...  E poi il mio sedere  perfetto -.-  tondo, sodo e tutto quanto...      "a kyart    m    ti posso vedere?"      A parte che... in che modo? E poi no, non mi piace conoscere gente su internet.

8XqhVXcdaa	Any oil-free foundation.   Tell you mom you're self conscious and you'd like to have some foundation to cover up imperfections.    Get some foundation at your local pharmacy.  Just use the lightest shade they have.    If you like powder, use powder, if you like liquid then get liquid. It all depends on you.  Make sure to use a moisturizer! Oil-free is you have oily skin, moisturizing if you have dry skin, or for normal skin. Get SPF 15.     Goodluck    Edit; Oil-free foundation does not clog pores. Just make sure you clean your face twice a day with a good face wash!|`|zyrxzDGuaa	It may be a little on the more expensive side, but bare minerals is an awesome makeup that can cover up ANYTHING.  I am very fair skinned, and this makeup just feels so light on the face and its easy to apply.    You have the Bisque- That specifically is for covering up blemishes    Then you have a powder that fits your skin tone, keeping your complexion even and very natural    Then lastly, the mineral veil, which puts it all together.    I do this with a little blush sometimes, and my skin is ready and flawless in 3 minutes.  And it's good for the skin also.    :)|`|3eb76dbedc463cbb00522d8e08b36360aa	Well I personally agree with your mom. I started wearing makeup when I was 12, but I didn't start experimenting much until I was around 14. I wouldn't worry about your skin. The freckles on your face make you who you are. I know its cheesy, but its true.     I used to wear foundation all the time because I too was self-concious when it came to my skin. But no matter what kind of cover up or powder I used, my pores got clogged and it made me feel like I looked even worse then before. Stick to no foundation or powder. Your skin will have a more natural glow to it anyways, plus it will save you a lot of worry because you won't be stressing over the pimples you would have if you wore cover up.|`|rZeoJXqsaa	I agree with your mum, you have good skin, there is no need to use foundation. Heavy foundations such as liquid foundation are normally use on people with problematic skin such as acne. Also foundations feel heavy on skin as though you apply a lot of makeup.    For you, if you want to cover up freckles, I suggest using a concealer preferably a stick or cream-based one. Then you lightly dust some loose powder all over your face and you are done. You can check out mineral powder as its the "in" thing now and its supposedly good for your skin.    Good luck!|`|bQ3KOSQgaa	You don't want to wear foundation anyway, it's gunky and it clogs pores.  Try a nice pressed powder applied with a large blush brush.|`|KO6Wqc4Aaa	u sound pretty to me.  im not even sure i know what foundation is.  but i would say just get some face powder?  im eleven though i hate makeup 100%(except for eyeshadow though i wont be wearing that fot 10 years)  My mom lets me wear face powder i didnt even care about it but she got it 4 me cause it was cheap and it works pretty good ive only used it like 20 times in the past 2 years or like 15 to 10 in the last 1 year.|`|gAEpWxphaa	Consider yourself lucky if you don't have any pimples.  There is nothing wrong with freckles.  It seems that you need some confidence rather than some foundation.  I am over 40 and I have never worn foundation in my life.  I just make sure to take care of my skin and go bare.  Try going bare and I am sure that it is not going to make a difference in how you are perceived.|`|nFzJkk0caa	hmm, bare escentuals a great foundation. you won't break out in them. so, yeah! haha.|`|qnrQFOXNaa	Hey there...        I would recommened L'Oreal Bare Naturale Powdered Mineral Foundation, according to L'Oreal, is "the healthiest form of coverage your skin can get..:         - Powdered minerals are all natural, providing a flawless makeup look in the purest of forms   - Powdered minerals provide the coverage of a foundation but the soft, light feel of a powder   - Perfect skin without the heavy, mask-like feel of many traditional foundation products, and allow skin to breathe   - Safe for even the most sensitive skins and provides natural sun protection   - Light to medium coverage   - Contains Aloe and Vitamin B5 to soothe, condition and protect sensitive skin   - Contains no unnecessary fillers, no unnecessary preservatives, and is oil-free and fragrance-free        Hope it helps :)|`|mjA4tl6Iaa	Try something natural like Bare Minerals or Bare Essentials.  Walmart sells mineral powders now.|`|yQgyhbEOaa	Tinted moisterizer! :)|`|Rs5VdiGLaa	you dont need foundation since you already have that youth beauty! all you need is maybe some blush for colour and a lipgloss!     btw... freckles are soooooooooooo cuteeeeeeee!!! xxxxx|`|vgzhvhQnaa	No No No, stay away from foundation as long as you really don't need it, and to me, it sounds like you definitely don't need it. It can cause your pores to clog, creating pimples, and not to mention large pores. I regret the day I started using liquid foundation.I started at about 13-14 and tried covering up my rosecea. If you really feel the need for it though, try mineral powders such as Sheer Cover, I love this stuff, or Bare Escentuals or inexpensive mineral powders such as Physicians Formula or the L'oreal brand. They won't clog your pores like the liquid stuff.|`|AA11827424	Go for a tinted moisturiser. Most skincare ranges for young skin have one. Then, if you need it, dust a bit of powder on top and you're good to go.

I live in heels, and whenever I buy cheap ones my feet suffer for it.|`|Gy1YkHoeaa	Hosiery helps and bare legged is going out of style anyway, but i think you may need to go up 1/2 a shoe size.

QWaspeg7aa	Use colour corrrecting cream first (green to counteract the redness) then use a foundation which says it is non-comedogenic which means it won't block your pores. If you blend a little bit of the green with the foundation and put that over the first layer of green you'll only need a tiny bit of foundation to cover that. Having said that, always use as little product as you can because acne plastered with make-up looks far worse than acne by itself.|`|AA10771601	see a dermatologist and get rid of the acne, it's usually pretty easy!  covergirl's aqua smooth is a nice foundation.|`|hwHJ1vzCaa	Concealer.

The principle behind this green makeup is that green cancels the red. Experiment with this SEVERAL times before you go out with it.   Process:   1) locate bastard red zit. 2) take green concealer and very, very super lightly dab n the red. It should *not* look green as much as pale. Cover the red areas, again trying to use as little as possible. 3)Then get your liquid makeup on makeup sponges (foam rubber triangles, usually) and dab lightly over the pale areas. 4) Stop. Look at it. You can always add more, but once you have gunked on too much you are super screwed and starting over is not always helpful at that point. 5) Dust with a finising powder.|`|7sivs9y2aa	use a cheese grater|`|db9df3e13343850e24298c3dbc47ab81aa	Almay  hypoallergenic they have a skin smoothing concealer that helps you heal too  best stuff on the market|`|LgYRrucuaa	Sheercover products are fantastic, look for them on ebay.

ehMPOlefaa	You're going to get all kinds of advice and opinions here and it's going to be from people who will want to try and help you.  My feeling is that you believe you have to overcome the outward appearance you have.  I believe that like most of them, personality is the thing that can set you apart from every other guy.  Developing it is another story.  You could be best served by having an example to follow.  Almost like a mentor or a coach.  If ever there was some guy friend you had who was successful at relationships with girls and was also willing to teach you then that would be ideal.  The fact is that men have done this all before and there shouldn't be a need for you to have to reinvent the wheel as the expression goes.  If you can learn how to do it from somebody who;s been there already, then you can be as good at it as they were.|`|JVPt99Hxaa	well it ent about looks but if u think that is the problem tn u should dye ya hair a different colour but u cnt do nuffin about ya freckles|`|FwJLD1uDaa	be yourself - lots of us girls dont judge by looks, its more the personality :)     best of luck!!|`|1f5996779efb6a4589f7767428fbc708aa	Don't worry for there are plenty of girls out there who like lads with ginger hair and freckles. I didn't do too badly. Join clubs where you will be able to meet many people and gain confidence.

It just looks good. Freckles don't bother me either. You don't have to be that outgoing. Shy girls often can't relate to outgoing guys. Well, I can't. It's fine if you run out of things to say, I think everyone but the really talented people do.     I don't know how to put it in words, but I guess I like shy guys because I know what it's like to not have anything to say to a guy and I can relate to them. Oh, I dunno!    Good luck anyway.|`|PsUPA8NPaa	if you're self conscious because of your freckles, take some time to tell yourself you're handsome and such...you're only 15, build up your confidence and girls will be attracted to the confidence|`|ijeninncaa	I really like that red hair look. If you're sweet, believe me, your personality WILL shine through. x|`|x4Gr4Mfjaa	1. Not every girl wants the typical dark haired guy. Don't worry about your hair colour, its good to be different. If you hate your hair that much dye it.  2. Freckles are SO cute, i wish i had them!  + 3. If you're crap at talking to girls, you're not gunna get better by ignoring them, pluck up the courage + just go for it. The more experience you get with talking to girls, the easier it will be. We're really not that intimidating :)    ?|`|yfMmr7uGaa	Maybe you should change your style  This is going to sound like a really horrible thing to say...  But if theres like a red haired chav, no one will be attracted to them, but if they had longer, straight hair and were like a skater/alternative style then people are attracted to them.    Oh and everyone saying stuff about personality, it only works if you meet them online and they fall in love with your personality before they find out what you look like.   A lot of the time if someone isn't attracted to your looks then they won't even give you a chance to get to know your 'amazing' personality. Because they may be instantly put off.  Or it will work if you just try and be a friend of theirs so they will begin to think about your personality and won't care about your looks because they don't think they'll ever get with you and then they're like wow he has an amazing personality and then they will like you no matter how bad you think you look.|`|eqkiNvoQaa	ok, sorry.. but to be blaintly honest what is the first attraction to someone? the looks... red hair and freckles arent always that bad.. Other wise i would recommend dress up more when you go to school, become more outgoing and have fun with it. For me usually 2nd is sense of style and third personality, if  a guy came up to me and ran out of things to say and walked away, i would automatically be like LOSER, not saying that you are, but just getting to the point have fun with it be outgoing and when you find a girl attractive dont get nervouse or walk away.. just say the last thing she'd ever expect you too. If those arent the kind of answers maybe color your haid light brown?///??/// if thats not an option i say just come comfortable in your own skin, take a couple days to yoursself and figure how you can become a better you and you know you are gunna be more confident..|`|C4Z7IEffaa	Have you ever noticed how strong confident men seem to punch above their weight with pretty women? Looks are not as important as someone who has confidence.   Stop trying to impress the girls you talk to, but chat about normal things. You will appear more confident and less needy and the girls will see the real you. Often the girls are just as insecure as you but hide it better.|`|rtkQzrXsaa	There is this guy that I used to go out with..  He has kinda red hair, lotsa freckles.. And the girls at school are all over him. He is a really funny guy, a bit cocky at times, but has a really genuine heart. My point is that his personality was what he really had going for him, and his looks were cute. Don't be so worried about what you look like, just work on being confident.. Ask your mates how they get girls if thats what you want the most. I hope this helped :) x|`|0OWxFJNLaa	I dont agree with the people that say it's not about looks... it's about personality. I'm not denying the importance of the personality but i'm of the opinion that looks have their own role to play in getting you a life partner/gf/bf etc. If this was not the case we wouldn't even have invented the words that describe the looks. However, parameters of beauty vary from person to person to some extent. But mostly if  something is ugly to someone it surly will be the same to others if they are being honest.
1oiZwj50aa	wtf horse shampoo?    Only kiddin' lol, why don't you just eat healthy and be patient?|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Horse Shampoo isn't going to make your hair grow faster. You can't make your hair grow faster, actually. Nothing has been proven. Just keep your hair healthy and it will grow better.|`|PsUPA8NPaa	mane n' tail is the best. But if the bottle doesn't say its for humans too i would suggest not using it. if you are really desperate, order it on the internet. Don't be self conscious because of shampoo!!
KpSVKtbLaa	the best way to it is so take a concealer and you put some of it on your finger and then put it with your finger on the lips, it makes your liips a bit dry so add some lip cream which is transparent,      thats how i do it and it works well|`|Twq7efhQaa	I agree that makeup, no matter how you prep, is not going to work. Your lip texture won't look natural. There may be some specially formulated topical vasoconstrictors on the American market within a couple of years that may be safe to use on your mouth, but the big issue they're trying to iron out in clinical trials is the rebound effect, where the tiny blood vessels dilate with blood again, sometimes painfully, after several hours of constriction. So if anyone recommends that you try any over the counter medication that contains these compounds, for God's sake, don't do it.     Your self-consciousness about your lip colour may be an example of how you, like many of us, are very attuned to what you think is a very obvious feature that just isn't noticeable for other people. Try a fake tan and see how it works. But otherwise, I'd recommend just shrugging your sh
fBPlvTK7aa	Thats the exact type I fall for. The shy, slightly awkward guy who doesn't know he's drop dead gorgeous. Modest, with a sweet smile.Too bad there seems to be a shortage of this type of guy.|`|HuJmTs8xaa	I love shy guys. I think they're a lot more attractive personality wise than confident, outgoing guys and I've never been attracted by looks. I know a lot of people don't agree, but what's in your soul is what really counts, not your looks. Anyways, shy guys always have a way of making you want to get to know them. They're mysterious and I think girls like that. I would definitely fall for a guy like that.|`|7dPwXcItaa	no girls think that shy guys r cute!|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	i fall for a confident guy...shy around people or not...as long as hes comfortable with himself and doesn't have trust issues and hes a great guy inside...im willing to make the jump and fall for him...  i have a bf, he was shy when i met him. he was a bit unsure of himself. he was comfortable with himself though and he knew what he liked and disliked, wanted and wanted to avoid...now hes pretty outgoing, he thinks hes good looking, and he kept all the humbleness and kindness he had before...tell ur buddy that he needs confidence in himself. its possible that a woman who is kind and shy herself or is just a wonderful girl will make him step outside of that box and gain some...sometimes that is what a guy needs, is a boost from a woman he care about and that woman believes its true.|`|Xhivbo6zaa	Yeah, I would like them cos I'm shy sometimes (:|`|ukJ0rk2vaa	YES! It kinda makes them seem more mysterious. =) Oh and it's awesome when the guy is handsome but doesn't know it.

CUt6AqJHaa	1) Eau de Toilette is a "watered" down version of Eau de Parfum. Its a weaker version and no you do not need to constantly spray every 2 hours. We wouldn't want to smell you from miles away! The general rule of thumb and options:  -pulse points and back of knee. Cleavage if female and chest hair for men. The chest hair is really good at retaining the scent.   -Spritz twice in the air and do a walk through the mist  -or spray some on your hairbrush and brush your hair. Your hair will hold the scent.  2)Eau de toilette and cologne is basically the same thing. A highly watered down version of the original perfume. Highest concentration of scent to lowest goes like this: perfume, eau de parfume, eau de toilette  3)You just need to spray once or twice, no more. You can't be the best judge of if you smell like it or not as your olfactory nerves in your nose get used to the smell. So bascially, spray in the morning and spray at night before your go out, to refresh the scent. That is all you need. As I said before, women, don't like to smell cologne from miles away, it takes away from the mystery!|`|QWaspeg7aa	Cologne is just a general word that means fragrance. Eau de Toilette is a   weaker version of Eau de Parfum. Eau de Toilette (EDT) is cheaper than Eau de Parfum (EDP) because there is less fragrance in it. The idea is that you use EDT as a day-to-day perfume and EDP when you need something stronger, like in the evening, or some people just use it because they prefer a stronger smell.   The best thing to do is to spray a little cloud of it, maybe 4 or 5 squirts, and walk through it. You should only be smelt by the people nearest to you rather than leave the fragrance in the room as you walk through. EDT doesn't last as long as EDP because it's not as strong but as long as you can still smell it you don't need to put any more on.|`|PNIihEDXaa	its true eau de toillette lasts less then eau de parfum. try get the body lotion as well wth the toillette and it will last a tad longer :) and just keep spraying and spraying but DONT go overboard!|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	always buy eau de parfum as it is rich and lasts longer than eau de toilette.    It is comparatively expesnive but would resolve your problem.    Generally, some perfumes have a tendency to last longer because they contain better quality ingredients than others.    Secondly, even your skin type will decide how long would a perfume last on you. Some skin absorbs it well and lasts longer while other do not.    Check out this best perfume list, they are all the ones that last longer: http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/11...

NMi1AZbqaa	Okay well my friends got their tongues pierced at the same time and they highly benifitted from eating slushy's afterwards :D It cools your tongue down and helps with the pain as well.    And as for what to eat, I would suggest mushy food like yogurt, custard, bananas, pureed fruit (like baby food, ha. :D) ,soup, popsicles, I dunno, anything that's mushy really.    and with getting your tongue pierced you just have to use mouth wash every night and morning to wash it out and use mouth wash when ever you eat something, it's probably the easiest piercing to clean.  Get Listerine it's best (:    Hope this helped you lovely.|`|zzPjs02Uaa	Popsicles are the greatest!! cold and numb!!  really it doesn't hurt as bad as everyone makes it seem.. just close ya eyes relax think abt another place... and in seconds its over!! :) good luck!|`|q0b6uPCraa	Close your eyes and relax, it doesn't really hurt. It's over in a few seconds. A blood test hurts more than that. Just curl your toes and prepare. Dont flinch!!!    Eat a slushy to numb your toungue and cool it down.    Then eat banana's, soup, yoghurt, smoothies.    Remember to use the mouth wash provided by your piercer. Use it as instructed.|`|u84hPxW1aa	It's not that you can't eat, but it will be hard. Hot foods and drinks should be avoided. So look at cold things like ice cream, frozen yogurt, chipped or crushed ice (you won't be able to fit a whole cube in due to swelling), drink lots of ice water. If you want to go for warm foods you could do soup (let it cool down).     When the swelling goes down enough to where you think you can eat solid food..take tiny tiny bites, eat slowly and carefully. PLEASE! If you bite down on your tongue ring you could shatter your tooth! Take me very seriously on that. Concentrate on your tongue being level in your mouth while eating. Do not eat ANYTHING spicy. This will increase the swelling.    It doesn't hurt until after wards when it starts swelling. Cold drinks, and ice will help. I went to QT before I went, and got a cup of crushed ice. Their ice is small and soft..it's only 5 or 10 cents. You go to the counter and ask for an ice cup. After the pierced it I walked out to my car and continued to do it. This helps with pain and swelling.    Your mouth with water a lot. So not only will you talk funny (due to swelling) but you might drool if you're not careful. Haha! Try not to talk too much though. The first barbell is long and your tongue will move up and down on it..this increases swelling plus it's irritating to feel.    After you eat, smoke (if you do) have mouth wash handy. Some plaque may get on your tongue ring, make sure to check that you can gently get that off with a toothbrush. If you are ever touching it with your hands make sure before you use antibacterial soap. Do not use undiluted mouthwash as this destroys the mouth natural enzymes which promote healing and it can cause ulceration (ouch!)    Don't play with it when you first get it. Even though this may be hard! No making out! This will hurt and may cause it to bleed.    Any more questions? :)|`|hDe26xfXaa	EAT ALOT BEFORE GETTING IT  EAAAAAT ALOOOTTTTTTTT|`|yPMPx78waa	my friend had her nose peirced and she lived on milkshake & ice cream for a few days? (:|`|CvP4rPliaa	ummm noodles baby food lol idk but agter like a few years your teeth will fall out yo so have fun bro.|`|LepOqaN4aa	i like this question.  aha.  i had mine done, and my tongue swelled up for about 3 days.  all i could eat was soup.    and it hurt afterwards  but i didnt get mine numbed before it was done, cause i got it done at tattoo shop.    all the other people i know got theirs done somewhere else and it was fine.    you can eat anything if you want    just make sure you use mouthwash after everything you eat, so it doesnt get infected.

FDBJs1lOaa	I  think that you should get in on the left side so that it will be balanced out and it won't be too much on just one ear. I have my helix on the left side and my industrial on the right.  The thing about the industrial is that you must take very good care of it by cleaning it with sea soak salt at least twice a day, not sleeping on it, and trying to avoid it getting bumped.  Good luck with your new piercing, it's amazing :)|`|zedSeGxjaa	Yeah, that way it'll balance your earrings out. I have my industrial on my right side and two cartilages on my left, and multiple general earrings.

3916f36babf2260a21d0a9cd8e5a3e64aa	Buy your local Sunday newspaper.  They have tons of coupons in them, and I always find ones for Rimmel, L'Oreal, CoverGirl, Max Factor, and others.  You will also find coupons for other beauty products like creams, shampoos, face washes, razors, etc.|`|mX27tszPaa	Yes there are!! First you should check the website of the company that you want coupons from.  For example if you want Olay Coupons, check their website first.

I put a link to an eHow article that tells you how to get Olay coupons but the process is basically the same for all cosmetic coupons.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4752117_get-olay...

Skinny jeans work best on tall or super skinny people.     For petites, avoid the boot-cut, it can kill and make you look stocky (or stockier, if you already are)     However, if you have big hips, the boot-cut would be good as it can even our the curves.     Avoid high-waisted jeans unless you are super tall and have a small waist to complement that.    If you have big thighs, do not go for jeans with bleached demin at the thigh portion.    Dark coloured jeans will have the slimming effect. So do not go for light grey/white jeans unless you are skinny. It's not flattering.    And if you are very overweight, wear slightly less hugging jeans, a looser fit would mute your extras.

yRlIXECTaa	You get what you pay for are words to die with. Basically there are a few types of makeup expensive, drug store brands and cheap crap.    Expensive: MAC, Urban Decay, Clinique, Chanel, Este Lauder. The expensive stuff is great for those of us who have nothing better to spend our money on and perform very similarly to the good drug store brands. So if you've got lots of money or have very sensitive skin this is your category.    Good Drug Store Brands: L'Oreal, Revlon, Maybelline, etc. Great color selection, the makeup stays on and is dependable.    Cheap Crap: Brands you find in a dollar store are probably not so good. Only buy these as an experiment to put together a look when you're not sure about color. Many of them are cheap and look cheap, are greasy, don't stay on, smell bad and can make your face break out.|`|5j0NgLDmaa	google Manic Panic.

Probably because of the baby blue colour. Maybe if they had chosen a black or neutral shade?     It was just so obvious that he was trying too hard.

cw2KARcPaa	Pinks, blues, purples, silvers, and golds are all going to look great on you... for you eyes that is... stay away from all black. Only use black for mascara!    As for applying your shadows, just play around with the colours. I do something different everyday and just have fun with it. Sit down one day with your girlfriends and just try new things with make-up. Its fun! Just get yourself some good eye make-up remover (Body Shop is the best) and some good brushes (remember to clean your brushes after the make-up party). Once you find a fun combination go with it, but don't wear it out, keep everyone guessing what you are going to do next. Be subtle one day and go crazy the next.    As for blush, I don't think you need any because you have amazing freckles and you don't want to cover them! But if you do, go with something light and pink, not too bronzy.    Good luck and have fun!|`|9lldaKNVaa	i have blue eyes and this works for me...  curl eyelashes(tarte eyelash curler from sephora) then apply define-a-lash in black then recurl. then on the top use black liquid liner (a thin line) then, for the bottom line use a medium blue pencil liner (i suggest the sephora brand)   i hope this heelpps! = ]|`|zih1Weanaa	Your eyes are very blue and already stand out, so it doesnt look like you need much more than mascara. Almay makes eye shadows, mascaras, and eyeliner that are specifically for blue eyes, and I really like their products.    However, do not line your eyes all the way around like the other two girls in the picture did. That is way too much and it just makes eyes look smaller.|`|HLzegoKNaa	Your eyes are really pretty!!  Anyways...  It all has to do with color theory.  Since your eyes are blue if you want them to stand out you need to use a color from the opposite side of the colour wheel such as red/orange.  Now, since red and orange shadows make you look sick I suggest using a dusty rose color, or a neutral gold-ish brown, its neutral enough to where you won't look like a complete fool. But it will make your eyes stand out. (if you are on a budget I recommend Jesses Girl Eye dust in Cafe Au Lait, its a neutral toupe-brown color, but its really shimmery so it will definately make your eyes pop).  Simply apply the color with a fluffy brush into the crease of your eye, very lightly though, you never need too much.  Also, eyelashes really help your eyes stand out.  So curling your lashes is a must. I curl once before mascara and once after mascara, and the first time I curl I heat up my curler with a hairdryer because it sort of acts like an actual hair curler, you know heat always makes the curl stay longer.  Then I would recommend a dark brown lengthening mascara such as the new maybelline lash stilleto, or I use clinique's lash power (But it is about $6 more than the maybelline)  Put it on both the top and bottom lashes, but make sure it doesn't look too clumpy.  And that is really all you need. If you want you can apply a medium brown eyeliner on your top and bottom lashlines (not your waterlines) but black eyeliner might be a little bit too much since you are so fair and blonde.    Hope I helped!

Then use this to draw a line across your lid as close to the lash line as possible, using the brush will help you get the line right into the lashes and also helps to blend it so it looks more even. Keep adding more colour to the brush as necessary. When you are happy with the width / length of the line you can know go over it with a liquid liner (I use macs liquid eye liner in boot black as it comes with a unique brush applicator for precision application) to make it look more defined.

t46TPqgWaa	I had freckles before I started using foundation and now I hardly have any because I wear foundation every day with spf 20 in it.  I know you want a cheaper foundation but the best 2 I have found for covering freckles were Bare Minerals and Estee Lauder Maximum Cover foundation.  The Estee Lauder one is waterproof and lasts all day - I use it with a little loose powder if my skin is oily or it's a hot day.      The Estee Lauder one lasts AGES cos you only have to use a tiny little amount each time.    Bare Minerals is good as it gives really good coverage, you don't need a lot and you don't need another powder over it really.  It looks pretty natural too so not a lot of people realise you are wearing a full face of make up!!!|`|x4Gr4Mfjaa	Why would you want to cover them up?!  I wish i had freckles, they're so cute.

cw2KARcPaa	I know my answer is long, but please, it is worth a read through!    My routine is pretty much the same, but I use a foundation primer after I moisturize. The best one out there is by Smashbox, it can be pretty expensive, but my I have less pimples now and my make-up doesn't cake and lasts a lot longer. Because I have uneven, reddish skin I have to use a green tinted primer, but it works miracles!    A lot of your issue might have to do with the quality of make-up you are using. For some things the cheap stuff is fine, but you have to remember that you are putting this stuff on your face and you don't want to be cheap about it! The concealer that I use is called Coverblend by Exuvience. I only use this for liquid foundation or concealer. They have it in many tones and it works wonders... But, if you are using this stuff or what you normally use its all in the application. Don't rub it in like its a lotion, this will leave more on your hands and not distribute the coverage like you need. Dab it on the areas that need it (for me its the chin and under eyes, and any where that is extra red that morning), and then blend it in gently, either by dabbing until its blended or using an application sponge.    I follow up with a loose powder. I have found some "cheaper" ones by CoverGirl that are nice and BareMinerals is good too. Get yourself some of this stuff and a good brush to apply it with. You might make a mess at first, goodness knows I did, so don't put your top on until you are done applying your make-up. You will need to practice with this, but once you get the hang of it your will ask yourself why you every used pressed powder before! And get rid of all of your pressed powder, when you use that you are doing nothing more than shoving more gunk in your pores. The lighter the application the better, and the less that has to come off by the end of the day!    Like I said before, make-up is expensive, but once you find stuff that you like it is totally worth it. Two years ago I would have laughed in your face if you told me that I would be spending $50 on a thing of powder... but now, I know when I have just enough left to get me through before I have to get some more!|`|AtJgXB59aa	maybe you should try a diff kind of moisturizer and a new kind of foundation.... n you don't have to use make up everyday im sure ur pretty enough to go to school without makeup but try liquid foundation instead and see how you like it|`|8l52BsB1aa	If you have a little bit of extra cash, you should try Sephora's powder coverup and concealer; you would not BELIEVE what a miracle that stuff is. I've used it for about half a year, it doesn't feel like it clogs my pores and since I have acne sensitive skin this is a nice feature. It covers up blemishes REALLY WELL, too.     BTW, you don't exactly state what your PROBLEM is in this question, so I'm just offering the advice that I can get out of the question.    Ciao:D|`|rhRPaoUYaa	I use to have the same problem until I discovered MAC cosmetics. Try the Studio Finish foundation, both powder and liquid are great, (I prefer liquid though). Also try their concealers. I know its a bit more expensive but at the end of the day you will totally notice. The good thing about these is that some of their cosmetics are buildable, that is you can reapply without it looking cakey.     Also if you have oily skin try the blotting powder.|`|9lldaKNVaa	powder concelear applied with a brush over liquid concealer lasts all day for me. i use covergirl clean makeup and physican's formula powder foundation. If your eye makeup wears off, try Define-a-lash by maybeline... but make sure you get the green bottle and that it is waterproof.  for eyeliner, try sephora brand shimmer eyeliners.. those stay on through EVERYTHING   i hope this helps! good luck = ]|`|44a092b3de8a0cd83d3e9bd5c9cb72f9aa	The washing part is similar to my routine. I never use toner before moisturizer..so far so good. Is your skin combi or oily? Do you sweat a lot? Make-up will be blotchy or worn off if you sweat excessively or if your skin is super oily. If this is the reason, get a good moisturizer for oily skin and a foundation that has oil control properties.|`|3g3dFk5baa	This isnt gunna help u much but the same thing happens to me everyday w/ make-up n it sucks...and btw i do tht same routine in tha morning lol but when u get some advice let me know

Poi datti una crema idratante.  Se hai gi fatto cos non so proprio come aiutarti!!|`|OWuUZuR8aa	ciao!!cosa hai combinato!!!la zona linguine  molto delicata... un a zona dove si concentrano tutti i vasi capillari...per quando riguarda la ceretta devi saperla distribuire e saper dare il giusto strappo altrimenti la zona si irrita...metti la giusta quantit stendila bene e strappa contropelo decisamente...senza far subire shock ai tessuti.ciao e buona strappata!!!|`|reSsIYjcaa	Farsi la ceretta da sole all'inguine  piuttosto rischioso. Prima di tutto per la scomodit della posizione e poi perch, anche volendo, non si  abbastanza dirette nel tirare.     Non  stata tanto la questione di strisce professionali o meno!    In ogni caso ti posso dare questi consigli:  1- evita la ceretta all'inguine da sola,  una parte molto, troppo delicata ed  meglio farsela fare da una professionista  2- se proprio non vuoi andare dall'estetista prova a farla prendendo pochi tratti alla volta in questo modo semplifichi l'operazione...anche se poi ci metti pi tempo  3- se la pelle  solo arrossata (e non vedi, ad esempio, che si sono formare piccole ferite) applica subito dopo una crema lenitiva, evita che la pelle si rovini e ti faccia male anche i giorni seguenti.    Spero di averti dato un buon consiglio!|`|YvooT3lMaa	segui tutti i consigli che ti hanno scritto nelle risposte precedenti..ti do solo un accorgimento in pi che secondo me  il pi importante;prima di strappare tira bene la pelle in senso contrario e strappa in modo deciso,cos facendo sar impossibile che ti faccia l'ematoma,fidati!|`|mdM01CTKaa	 NORMALE STAI TRANQUILLA

2ZsRAxkuaa	Most piercer can pierce with a clear retainer. But it has to be bioplast/ptfe or quartz. And normally have to be ordered in specially.    But most retainers come with o-rings. Which have a rather big habit of falling off piercings that move. Like lips. So in those cases, most piercers will want to use normal jewellery. Or use a titanium ball, which kinda defeats the point or retainers.    Go ask your piercer anyway.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Regular jewelry till it heals then a retainer afterwards

However, I helped her research the surgery prior to her doing it.  In the USA, plastic surgeons are MUCH better than cosmetic surgeons; many people don't know that.  I'm not sure if it's the same in the UK, but you might want to look into that.  Also, she got the saline, not the silicon.  Lastly, she had them implanted under the muscle, not just under the skin.  It looks much more natural that way.  Anyhow, hope that info helps.

They also have photos pasted of their International patients.You can checkout their website.The cost savings are incredible.As a doctor i personally believe that your surgery can be easily handled in India as the quality of healthcare available here is simply best in the world.The surgeons are USA/UK trained and facilities are 5 star .

XamvU56waa	Il mio dermatologo, dato che ho una pelle particolare, mi ha sconsigliato l'uso di latte detergente e tonico.  Lavo il viso solo con acqua tiepida e stendo una crema all'acido salicilico specifca per il mio tipo di pelle.  Come idratante per il corpo uso creme a base di burro di karit ( molto idratante), si trovano nei negozi The Body shop.  Faccio uno scrub corpo alla settimana e ricorro ad un semplice rimedio fai da te: unisco del sale grosso a dell'olio d'oliva e aggiungo qualche goccia di essenza profumata.  Faccio anche una maschera all'argilla verde una volta alla settimana e un peeling al viso ogni 10 giorni. Come se non bastasse ogni 5 giorni faccio un trattamento all'acido salicilico.

What you should do is do and image search of things you are interested in. Once you find a picture for your tattoo call around and visit local tattoo shops. Ask them how much they would charge you to get it done. Don't just get it done at the first place you visit.   Remember: you want to have you tatto done in the most sterile shop and pay the least you can.    The first shop I went to was gonna charge me $150. I went to about 5 other shops and the last one I went to (which is the place I got mine done) charged me only $60.      Hope this helps|`|WeUEAIg9aa	Do you know what you want?? even a little???

DCIPrG1gaa	I personally do not like either. They're both way out of the price range of what I can afford as well, but I guess if I had to choose then I'd pick Abercrombie. I think Aeropostale is a lot more for younger teens and Abercrombie is for older? I really have no experience though, so I couldn't tell ya if that's true or not.|`|RsDAGnBhaa	They're both good but I like Abercrombie better. Both of the brands make all of their shirts really thin...which i think is pointless, because then you have to buy even more to layer them so people don't see your bra =_=. Aeropostale puts too much of their logo on everything. Abercrombie.....is sometimes more subtle lol.|`|2RInFX4Qaa	I Like Abercrombie and hollister =]|`|0ckXZSGFaa	Abercrombie all the way!

But if I had to pick one of them , I'd pick Aeropostale.     Aeropostale - it's kind of hard to tell which clothesi s for guys or girls.

GrJLJUMZaa	the only real way i can think of to fix this is to blow dry it. that makes it more volumous and you can style it how you want and then straighten it.  to temporarily fix it, flip your hair a few times by bending over and swinging back up. but that only lasts for a little while..  you could also try teasing it  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7AtNQi_BO...  or use your fingers and kind of pull up your hair on the roots and just kinda mess with it.  and the only other way is to use products, but personally i hate using them cuz if i touch my hair it gets all like sticky and i like my hair just being natural.  but yeah i would try blow drying it, even though you say you dont want to :)|`|Draugm5qaa	volumizing conditioner and spray,  tease it with a comb.    best answer !|`|paHjJrrdaa	Flip your hair over add mouse and hairspray to roots work thought alittle and flip it back and wha-la!|`|ovOA9hZ1aa	tease it    go to youtube and find out how
HuFP02Wdaa	First of all, this is really weird, my name is Julia and I have red hair and pale skin!   :)  Blues and greens look really good with red hair and light skin. I think you should wear a singlet top in say, blue or aqua, etc  Then shorts(black, denim, whatever)  Then wear some chunky jewellery e.g Square bangles, different shaped beads.  Then you could wear thongs or sandals. I don't think you should dress JUST to impress him, just do what he'd like but you're still comfy in.   As for the eye thing, Put light eyeshadow on the inside of your eye, then gradually make it darker at the outside. I think brown would look good blue eyes, purple with green, and green or blue with brown.  It would look really cute if you have long hair, to make it wavy.  Also, with the clothes, you may like to try a vest, but it depends on what you like. I personally don't like vests on me, but they look really cool on some people.  Most of all, just have fun!!   :)  Good luck, by the way awesome name and hair colour and skin colour lol we're practically twins :)|`|AA11123061	according to ur skin tone u can wear torquise color ,that would totally pop ,however u can also try light floral colors . dont change ur personality fo rsomeone ,be urself . be simple and casual .ur bf likes u for who u r .|`|xJ0HJKlXaa	HA HA, nothing is made for girls over 5'6", lol, what a joke.... finding anything long enough to fit me at 5'8.5" is impossible, add shoes, and i'm almost 5'10"     anyways.. you should wear dark wash skinny jeans, and a cute blousy top, mabey with some kind of bold blocky pattern. kohls is good for that.... blue, pale yellow, purple combos look good.... add a pretty necklace- either a simple chain w/a tiny charm, OR a bolder heavy necklace.    make up: keep it simple, mascara, mabey a little Brown eyeliner on top lash line only, use a light shimmery eyeshadow on the pad of your finger and dab to inner eye corners to make your eyes look bigger, farther apart and brighter.    use only cherry chapstick, it has enough color to do it, but not be goopy, and it tastes good and is easy to reaplly w/o a mirror...      have fun!|`|B3LZqvPfaa	i decided i need to answer this because you look JUST like me from your description.  selena gomez was seen wearing a similar outfit to one i love. this is bright colored skinny jeans. (you can get them at marshalls or forever 21) with a white long sleeve top and a cool scarf ( if you do colored jeans make the scarf a black and white pattern) or you can do normal skinny jeans with a different scarf. that would also work.  if you do colored skinny jeans i'd recommend black low top converse and have your hair down with some cool earrings.  this isn't a guaranteed win since i don't know your figure etc. but its worth a try since i love this outfit.    Dark blue and purple are good for brown eyes and they could even match the jeans. do a semi thin line on the top lid of one of those two colors. Do black on the lower lid. to make them look farther apart, do a tan colored eyeshadow on the inner crease of your eye but JUST A LITTLE. don't put it on your whole lid.    good luck =)|`|l57BE2JTaa	i would go with colored skinny jeans and like either flats or boots over the jeans with a cute shirt that matches the jeans.   and for make-up i would go with eyeliner with eyeshadow that matches your outfit and mascara. also take a lighter tone of the color of eyeshadow and wear it as if you were putting eyeliner on again. it adds alot.  wear your color of foundation with a bronzer and little blush.  i have very fair skin. people tend to call me albino and i do everything i just told yu and it helps major.    good luck. :)
lcfOYn2Faa	Im also 13! I have the same exact problem. What I did is I got it trimmed and then I started using 2 brand new shampoo and conditioners. I used 1 on 1 week and the other the next week and so on. The 2 shampoo and conditioners are pantene relaxed and natural and herbal essences the 2 pink 1's for damaged/ permed/ colored hair. And then I don't touch my hair at all but if you can't resist you should brush it a little bit and then if it starts to curl keep touching it to make it straight. If it doesn't work for you, you should blow dry it. And if you want wavy- ish hair you should do everything except blow dry it. Hope this helps.  *crzyshopaholic13*|`|a16lpaqGaa	i would imagine that using a straightener is the only way to go about it. but it will damage your hair, so make sure you use something to protect it. you can also get it permed straight...which is very damaging.|`|WE3Qutwuaa	I would have to say no matter what, don't try to straighten it everyday or something because it's going to ruin your hair and since curly hair tends to become dry, it might make things worse.    There really is no way to straighten it other than by using a straightener, but you could try to draw a comb through your hair as you blow dry it. But then again, it make your hair drier than ever (I've tried it before).    So either get a straightener (but don't starighten it everyday) or get some good products for curly hair which'll make it look better so you'll like it more.|`|my6MkQcoaa	i have a very wavy and curly black hair i always want straight. my friends has very shiny long straight hair but you only 13 you should not use iron it will damage your hair i was always using iron to make my hair straight. but now my hair is not shiny not soft so stupid. finally i found a cream calls hair straight cream its from japan. you can buy it from hong-kong only for 10 dollars hope i helped you but it very good|`|LVO8ixtaaa	You could get it chemically straightened at a salon.

lcprTALKaa	Due to the increase in skin cancer, media and fashion are promoting fair skin.  There are a lot of skin products out there now to whiten your skin as opposed to tanning it....  Choice is for the consumer.|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	My buttocks.  I want to be tan.|`|63s3G8YUaa	It is probably a result of the recent skin cancer coverage that is saying that real tans are out.

I think its stupid that tans are "in" now and pale will be "in" now/in the future... its just a way of making people feel bad about their skin color.     But there is some truth to "pale is the new tan".   Although most girls at my school still wear fake tan,  alot of people around, I've seen are staying pale and on yahoo answers I've heard of girls who aren't from India/Asia ask how to "embrace their fairness".     So... really.. all skin colors are beautiful,  and I'm so sick of one color being fashionable and the "best".|`|iKyxxAo6aa	idk if pale is the new tan but it should be. pale skin is pretty.|`|mrS0Gg3Faa	i agree... but not in a way that we should all have white skin, i just want to say that everyone should stay away from the sun, and to use good sunscreen, because it can cause skin cancer. past years it was popular to have as dark skin as it was possible, but now it is not so important.|`|uxqkJEIcaa	You got that from a shirt.    Pale would only be the new tan now, because being tan in the middle of winter if it's not your real skin tone is really weird and obviously fake.    Pale will probably end up being the new tan because us pale kids won't be suffering and dying from skin cancers. (:    So, eventually, all the tan people will die off and all that will be left are people who have no melanin.     This is called Natural Selection, or "survival of the fittest".

154dzJ1Faa	Thickness refers to the number of hairs on the head.  Coarseness refers to how fat each hair is.    You were born with all the hair you are ever going to have.  A hair can only grow from a root, and you can never grow any new ones.  What you have is all you will have.  There is no way possible to make your hair any thicker than it is -- if you are healthy.  There are some medical situations or medications that can cause some hair to slow down or fall out, but they are still alive and can be made to come back to life.  But that is only a few more hairs.    The fatness of each hair can make it look like you have more.  Coarse hair will have more stiffness and volume than fine hair.  What you will have to do is coat the hair with something that will add more bulk and stiffness.  There are lots of styling aids, and they all work to some extent.  Even sugar dissolved in water will work.  Set your hair on rollers for more volume (even large rollers).  Shorter hair has more lift than long heavy hair.    If all else fails, extensions (extra hair) might be what you want.  Discuss this with a qualified hair stylist and see what they suggest.|`|50qgybd5aa	don't wash your hair alot. let it get greasy   only deep condition once a week  massage your head alot to get the blood to the roots  Vitamin B  you will find this in :  cereals - egg yolk - milk - nuts vegetables - meat  chiken - fish - & cauliflower    heres a trick i do when i blow dry it   say if you part down the middle  take the left side  take a section thats about an centimeter  flip that onto the right side & blow dry the roots  so they are being dried the Opposite side of your hair  keep doing that all the down to almost your ear  do that to right right side   ( flip the hair on the right side to the left side of your head )  that way it's like tricking your roots that its being dried that way  so when its the way you want it will have a bit more volume   it's like flipping your head upside down & blow drying it :P    if you don't understand this you can contact me through email  hifey4lifey@hotmail.com|`|MgiK02Zbaa	dont shower.|`|LiuKX0X5aa	apparently Samy Fat thickening shampoo+conditioner works well.

Whichever one you get, I don't think it won't help you shed any extra pounds or add any more muscle.|`|nAlyuyaDaa	I would never use a bag that expensive for smelly socks and sneakers.  It's wasteful and silly.  Just get a good duffel bag from Adidas or Jansport or someone.  It really doesn't need to be fancy, so long as it's utility is preserved.  Dark color, waterproof lining, maybe even a shoe separator is ideal for your use.

I actually wore an 8 at my smallest, so I consider it small.  A lot more goes into a dress size than your waist measurement.  If your chest/hips are larger, then you need a bigger size.  It's just a number that helps you determine what will fit best.  As long as it looks good on you, it doesn't matter.

6CxIDIQcaa	Clothes: Purples would look great on you. Along with lighter shades like pink and any blue. Maybe not so much orange because if you have olive skin tone it might make your skin look orange too.  Makeup: I wouldn't wear a lot of face makeup- base, bronzer, etc. Especially if you are lucky enough to have an olive skin tone.  But I think blush would look pretty and with your green eyes maybe a goldish or brownish color eyeshadow-something that would look natural and bring out your green eyes.  :D|`|FQuuztpQaa	No colors. Just wear natural & mix up colors.|`|Lju4GLFJaa	purple makes green eyes really stand out.  some olive skin also looks great with the gold or bronze shades.  play around with color & you'll find what looks best on you  (:

This site: http://www.body-piercing.com.au/body_pie...    suggest 6-12 months which is standard for cartilage and can take even longer. Keep cleaning it, try not to bang it (although I know this is easier said than done when sleeping) and it should help it heal as soon as possible.|`|VR9iC2ykaa	omg i got mine done Aug 2007 .. it is still not completely healed..
JbSebJJYaa	It takes a while to heal. I've had mine for a couple of years and every now and then, it will get infected. It's a very very easy area to get infected since you are letting germs in when you are breathing. Just make sure to keep it clean and don't switch out the nose ring for a month or two to be safe. I went to Walgreens and got tea tree oil and it cleared up my infection really fast. Just beware of the smell. It's not too good.      - Paul Mitchell Salon Professional|`|H6I0vEoWaa	maybe a booger is stuck in there lol XD|`|485b0a537e73379bb64ed3928743579eaa	Soreness is normal, you've had a needle shoved through your flesh.  Itchiness is also normal and means your flesh is healing and itchiness happens with all sorts of healing wounds.  Do what the piercer told you do to do keep it clean etc. and you should see the soreness and itchiness fade.    Keep an eye out for redness or soreness that gets worse, etc.
k1bR1BHiaa	Nope. I love each of my tattoos and they all have meaning. If you think you're going to get bored then tattoos might not be for you.|`|OOtme2jkaa	get a temporary one if u like it go for it.  i think u get bored when u get something u werent aiming for.  or they messed it up in the process..|`|AV0eejfLaa	I have a black rose wrapped half way around my belly button and three dots on my left hand between my thumb and index finger and totally regret it especially the one on my hand b/c everyone can see it so I would think about getting something on ur wrist it's not that easy to hide if u don't like it in the future|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	nope no regret at all and i'm a commitment phobe! i got a white ink tattoo and you can still see it but it doesnt scream out at people so if i decide that i dont want it when im 60 it wont be noticeable :P|`|WJUxHXsAaa	if i did have one then yeah!!!! its like drawing yourself with a pen but it wont come off think about that|`|LoKFXWFzaa	Not at all. I got my ankles tattooed 2 years ago. Though I went to a reputable shop, the artist made some errors. They are both well done, but they aren't quite the same position, and they aren't shaded the same at all. Of course, no one is going to see both at once, but this does bother me. All the same, I like them, and I don't regret them. I wish they were higher quality, but they are art and meaningful to me, and I'm glad to have them as they are rather than not at all.    I recently got a large back tattoo lined and shaded, and I know that as I age, that will be the bigger concern. But the way I look at it is this--a tattoo is part of you. You get used to it, and for me, I know it'll just feel like something that is naturally a part of me. So even if I age to feel that I don't like it--be that design, color, or the inconvenience of what I can't wear when I need to hide it--it's not worth regretting. As long as it has meaning, you can feel inconvenienced without regret. But that is a mindset thing. If imperfections like pimples or some particular feature of yourself drive you nuts, a tattoo might drive you nuts in the future if you grow out of it.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	My friends and I all Have illusion on our lower back, and Shattered En Pedazos on our shoulder blade things on our backs..    we would all like to get Distracted on something else or Misfortune we are yet to decide.

The job market is still prejudiced against these even though they won't admit it. I got mine on my right shoulder blade and I can show it off if I want or hide it just as easily. Also, avoid areas that will stretch with pregnancy or weight gain or sag with age. It happens. Just don't forget that you will have it for years to come so get something that reflects your personality.    Also, if you get words, make sure that they REALLY mean something to you and they aren't a boyfriend's name or something equally potentially regrettable.     Also, I don't know this for a fact, but I hear that if you get a tattoo on the inside of your wrist, the hospital cannot put an IV in where the ink is. Same with your spine. If you want an epidural when and if you have children, think about that. They don't like to put IVs into your dominant hand's arm apparently because of the blood flow changes or something. One of my friends is on track to get into medical school.     I hope you decide on what's best for you!

hzxplycYaa	I am not a hair stylist, but I have been wearing clip in hair extensions for years. Yes, you can put your hair up but it's not as easy as it seems. The clips show very easily when the hair is up and sometimes it hurts because when you pull up your hair, the clips tend to tug at the hairs its clipped on. There will be some adjusting to do. They're pretty good at staying in. I sometimes go to the beach with them also (but remember chlorine/salt water really damages it!) and it stays put. Clip in extensions are great because they usually stay in place. The only time I really had to watch out was when I go dancing. I'm a crazy dancer, so they fall off easier... other than that, you're good :) If you get 100% human hair, you can always curl or flat iron them (but it does dry it out and damage it). But do keep in mind that if you are planning to get synthetic ones, you CANNOT put ANY heat to them... or else they'll melt. Overall, I give hair extensions a 9 out of a 10. :) Good luck!|`|GTYYogMNaa	if you need extensions  http://horrorkidz.com/  Ive ordered from them several times, and no one can compare to them.   they are just amazing!    ive tried etsy, hairhxc and hottopic. lol and i personally think horrorkidz is the best quality you can get.|`|9s0Pfvvmaa	yeahh you can put your hair up, there good at staying in depending on how good of quality your slips are ive had a few where they werent very good soo i just bought some new ones. but they wont fall out unless someones yanking hard on them.  real hair ones are better so you can style them, plus they dont frazzle unlike the fake ones.    hope this helps

Because I sell it!  There are so many Avon reps out there.  Competition is all over!  What I personally did to get more customers was to buy a bunch of samples, a bunch of brochures, and a bunch of door hanging plastic bags (you can buy under sales tools section).  Then I went out to all the different neighborhoods, recruited a few freinds and passed those suckers out!  I went around 10 am most people are at work so just hang them on the door.  I get alot of call backs this way.    Also I went to a nearby campus and just laid them out everywhere!!!  If you go on your online account with Avon there are MANY MANY tools that you can use.

Some people are stuck in those places with nothing to do and must get terribly bored. They could go through the catalogue together and even if they couldn't afford much, it'd be worth it for the excitement a change from the norm would provide. Nurses at hospitals might be a good idea too, put a catalogue in the ward and have one nurse in charge of making sure all orders are in on time, (Obviously, she'd have to have a little incentive to help but I'm sure a staff discount or something like that would work out.)

7db15117ce6c1672da442e743f9a214daa	Talk to your doctor.  It sounds like your acne is hormonal, so getting on a birth control that is also an acne fighter (Jasmin) would be a good option.  If you're not into birth control, then ask about other options, you could get tricyclene (or tetracyclene...I can't remember)...one of those does acne, it's an antibiotic.  There's also medical ointments that you apply onto your zits.  But, since tricyclene is an antibiotic, it will make your birth control less effective, so talk to your doctor.      Don't be afraid to ask your parents about birth control.  Seriously, if you're really afraid, have your mom join you and talk with the doctor.  It's a great way of dealing with hormonal acne.  My mom put me on birth control for acne way before I was into the boys.      If you don't want to bother with the doctor, try tea tree oil.  I use it as an acne med.  It won't stop you from getting zits, but you can put it on just when you feel like you're getting one and it will stop it from getting nasty or clear it up quickly.      I dunno, you sound just like me. I just do the  tea tree oil and it works.  I also use Vichy face wash...you'll notice something about clean and clear, biore and neutrogena - they're all cheap.  Vichy will cost you an arm and a leg, but I've found that sometimes you need to splurge.|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Try this simple remedy. Wash your face twice a day in warm salty water.

If you are up for natural treatment then a few changes in your lifestyles and diet can ameliorate your skin.    http://ezinearticles.com/?Natural-Remedi...    http://www.articlesbase.com/acne-article...|`|h7oh1o3Faa	try proactive|`|TkQBalj9aa	ugh pimples are the WORST. I've had to deal w/ them for a while and it was torture.   DO NOT get proactive; it made my face worse. (and it is really harsh for dry/sensitive skin)    I suggest drinking a lot of water (take your weight and divide by two - that should be how many ounces you drink per day)    And you know, just wash your face every night, don't pop your pimples, etc...    For the cleanser, everyone's skin is different, so you're just gonna have to find one that works for your skin.  I like Aveeno because it is gentle   http://www.aveeno.com/productDetail.do?p...  but like I said, everyone has different skin.

They have a really good selection of tea tree oil products. Or whole foods. Might be pricy but works well and keeps your skin moinsturized.    If that doesnt work try to buy some natural soaps without chemicals. If yyour acne isnt that bad then the chemicals you use might be too strong.    BUT if none of that works. Go for proactive. I used it for a while but then didnt feel like spending the money. I don't have a huge acne problem either and its not too harsh on my skin. But that'ts just me.
ogeE0I92aa	You can try using smaller strokes to reduce the streaking. Also, it would help if you have a buffer brush like a kabuki so you can gently buff your face out to remove the streaks. I personally use this method when my 187 stippling brush is still wet from cleaning it. I suggest you try that brush too! That will save you money since you'll use less foundation with that! You also won't get streaks and you'll get that nice airbrushed look.|`|QMnoPj0zaa	its the brush you're using. noone really uses the 190 anymore. they use the 187. esp with studio fix, satin..etc. or the 187, since its smaller than the 187. another great brush to apply foundation is the 109.     and you need to BUFF! and when you think you buffed enough, buff more. buffing is the best.       and then set with powder! ta- da youre done|`|0cJjyogqaa	take a look the video, hope works for you... ^_^

8zt7m010aa	Don't wash your hair everyday, that makes it worse.    Wash your hair every few days (you would be surprised at how clean your hair can stay--up to 4-5 days!.. if you dont work out much)    Also, brushing your hair can make it frizzy too. So only brush before a shower or when you know you're going to put your hair in a ponytail so brushing it wont really matter.    Edit: I dont get why all the helpful answers are getting thumbs down... DONT BUY PRODUCTS. they are a waste of $ and arent worth your time. Also, NEVER BRUSH YOUR HAIR WHEN IT'S WET. that's like rule  1 on maintaining hair.|`|2392e38c79fe02ed6ab71edaae035f36aa	biosilk!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     ask about it at your hair salon. it's exactly what you need.|`|uly3aFqtaa	Don't wash it so much!    You're drying it out like crazy, use Shampoo only on the roots 2 - 3 times a week. Use Conditioner every time you have a shower and wet your hair.    Don't brush your hair! Comb it very well in the shower, and when you get out, don't rub your hair with the towel - gently scrunch it. You can put it up in a Turban with the towel, but don't yank the towel off.    If you do this every timeyou have a shower and don't brush/comb your hair [besides in the shower], you might even notice curls forming!    Xx.|`|Ayn7tpXKaa	I know it sounds kind of gross but if you put some milk and honey into a bowl, mix it together, or with a mixer - and warm it up a bit,  Put it on your hair, particularly the ends and the frizziest areas.    Leave it in for about an hour, and rinse it out.  This should help.    If you dye your hair, like I do, using egg whites is also good.  There are a lot of natural ways you can do it.    If you want to just buy something - I highly highly suggest Sebastian Potion 9 serum.  I used to bleach my hair and it looked silky and healthy, which it totally wasn't.  I'm not sure where you live but in Canada it's about $25 a bottle.  Well worth it!  Good luck!|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	if you use a flat iron  or a curling iron not very long it will help|`|iAw1q6kbaa	just use conditioner .......|`|JD4MbxDHaa	wet your brush when you brush your hair   it wil sleek down the hair and it will look smooth :D|`|bwU0asquaa	Okay so for frizziness, I use the paul mitchel sleek product.  its in a clear bottle.  it works really well.

Here's another option Idk how well it works but it's in a book:  "after shampooing, rinse with one tablespoon of wheat germ oil, followed by a mixure of 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar and 2 cups of water. it will tame the frizzies."|`|50qgybd5aa	are you washing or rinsing with hot water ?  just remember your hair is like a piece of silk .  you can still have hot shower just when you rinse  turn the hot down, & cold water actually makes your  hair soft & shiny .  never rub (towel dry) your hair, just squeeze excess water .  when you brush your hair when wet, use a comb & start  at the bottom of your hair & work your way up .  put more conditioner at the ends of the hair & leave in for 5 minutes  only deep condition your hair once a week.  let your hair air dry a bit before blow drying it .|`|4cQSsDaZaa	use aussie sprunch spray and while it is wet just spray some on your hair and it smooths it out. it helps me alot!!!!:)|`|4426e23fcbe713a62fb9a5df2196730aaa	buy Silk Drops!!! my hair gets soooo frizzy.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	Ha! this is a first. Lately I've been seeing blacks ask how they can get "white people hair," lol.     Blacks have different types of curly hair, but for most it's tightly curled hair. I've never heard of anything that will make your hair curlier than it is. Usually, people want to loosen their curls, not tighten them. There are different types of texturizers, one that loosens the curl pattern and one that gives your hair curls, but your hair is already curly and you don't want to loosen it and you already have curly hair, so a texturizer probably wouldn't work.     Just learn to love what you have because you are beautiful no matter what!|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	you could get it permed but i dont think thats very good for your hair, & trust me, i am black grl, and have an extreme fro, it aint as much fun as it sounds|`|S01zIagOaa	No. Love yourself for who you are as you're the only you that you've got.|`|AA11910088	Absolutely not you cannot change the texture of your hair I'm sorry.|`|uHIIVbGwaa	try a texturizer
bwU0asquaa	first you will want to curl your hair, with an curling iron (im hoping you know how to do that)  then you will need a teasing brush, they sell them everywhere for cheap.  you will take the hair in the front just like her and take it piece by piece and tease with the brush and hairspray and then pin it in a pomp adore with bobby pins.  then you will need some kind of clip to clip your hair back like that.  it shouldnt be that difficult.  then you will neede to hairspray all of your hair

ZdF1hx70aa	Look for a nice trouser jean. Then a boyfriend jean. See you are going to brand stores that only fit certain types of bodies. I don't have this problem but my sister does and she shops through Delias.|`|UKGJxaoaaa	Alloy!! Seriously check them out! they are delias sister store I believe!|`|S61oU0yFaa	The straight legged jean is a great suggestion, because they fit the widest part up by your hip and go straight down. It's the male version of a trouser jean. Sometimes you need to go up a size and have them hemmed up so they accommodate your height, but sometimes that's the sacrifice we make for a really good fitting pair or jeans.  Don't get discouraged if you have to go one size bigger, because you can always tailor them down. You would rather have 3 pairs that fit you really well then 10 that don't.
aX6RFBV5aa	maybe your bro's just trying to be protective. he's older, so he knows what other boys his age think of girls your age.    you might not think people can see your undies, but maybe they really can. ask a friend their honest opinion. be aware of what people are doing when you're wearing that skirt, do guys look at you a certain way? do you get more attention by wearing it? do you WANT that attention in the first place? if the answer is no to all of those, than you have no problem. if there is a yes answer, but you still feel comfortable while wearing the skirt, then again you have no problem. but if you find the extra attention makes you uncomfortable, stop wearing the skirt. or find ways of covering up some leg - many girls wear leggings under short skirts.|`|JWu1exdQaa	it looks cute to me!|`|5wAk1Ctkaa	your brother needs to relax! if you wore some short shorts under the skirt there is no problem!|`|4sVB0efkaa	You're only 13 and you wear a skirt that short? girllll.....wheres your mom...|`|AEmD1Mtyaa	He's just being protective, it's quite sweet really.

7db15117ce6c1672da442e743f9a214daa	Embrace your newfound curls, but control them with a hair serum like Fructis' hair serum.  It's just a grapeseed oil.  It weighs down your hair so you don't get the frizzies, but it doesn't make you look greasy (unless you put too much on).      Bring some headbands to get your hair controlled.      Also, you'll probably find that you should just condition your hair rather than shampooing it frequently.|`|oKvyaIPSaa	Matrix hair gel is good for curly and frizzy hair.|`|zvbjtfayaa	frizz-ease hair serum  works well.  and adds a wonderful shine|`|8MTN47C9aa	Schwartzkopf is an excellent product. The smoothing gel and Magic. It's a gloss that never gets greasy and really works! Certain salons carry it only. You just have to call around.|`|KqHiTH6Xaa	My hair is the exact same and we go to cozumel every year for spring break so i understand how much of a hassle it is. Usually when I'm there I just put mousse and then hairspray in my hair, gel doesn't really keep mine from staying unfrizzy. I just use Tresemme flawless curls mousse and hairspray, its not expensive and you can find it at Wal-mart, Walgreen's, etc. And if you're wanting to wear your hair straight then I would agree with the person below Friz-Ease but not the serum (i think it makes peoples hair look greasy usually) just something for frizziness.     Hope this was some help!
6CpRaLSAaa	Well i am a transvestite and i love to wear women's clothes and i was told that you should always wear what makes you feel good so i am 100% with you on whatever you decide because it is all about how you feel. I always have thought that there should be clothes not just men and women so you could wear whatever you want, women have done this for years, men are  just trying now to wear more different clothes. Try wearing other women's clothes you might just start feeling better about yourself. Dresses, mini-skirts, short shorts all are fun to wear. Anyway good luck on whatever YOU decide. Michelle|`|HCeCpPQfaa	I'm pretty sure thats what my bro wears.. i know he wears girl jeans.. he likes the feeling of them better than boy jeans.|`|QYn2hVgYaa	no got to hot topic, zumiez, pac sun, and buy skinny jeans for men ya freak|`|S61oU0yFaa	I'm not personally a fan of girl's jeans on men, because they're cut for a woman and they don't accommodate a guys body.  I guess if you like the tight look then go for it.  Don't let anyone else stop you from wearing what you want to wear.  The Jonas Brothers have been doing it and look how popular they are!
4c6210a60520446edc5b3b9a7a3a71f8aa	No, no no - men don't have hips so those jeans would make a guy look like he has womanly hips.  Unless you are going for that androgynous look, then I'd say no, no no.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	aaahhh...don't they fit funny and button/zip/open on the wrong side ???

EfifnL7Taa	Waxing pulls hair and skin, which is not good. It's more messy and expensive. Waxing is only good for large areas, like legs.  Threading is cheap, more defined and only pulls the hair - not the skin.  Threading is better for facial hair.|`|OOtme2jkaa	i havent tried threading.  but waxing definitely burns!!  but i find it better it lasts way longer to me  but then again i havent tried threading=]|`|aae33ca98ed4acc2878892601466ebc5aa	I agree I love threading!

WE3Qutwuaa	i was thinking black would have looked great on you, but since you said it didn't, blonde or light brown.|`|ocIsJXHGaa	you have light eyes, go with a light color, blonde|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	blonde  will accentuate your lovely eyes|`|ipPjVP8Iaa	you should go with a caramel color..
cKiN7BLPaa	I think that you should go with the size that usually suits you
1eRuZjOraa	The difference is just basically the size. The 3025's can come in 55mm, 58mm, and 62mm, the RB 3026 only comes in 62mm.     You can see that here: http://www.shadesdaddy.com/Ray-Ban-Aviat...
QCGVAtWWaa	My navel piercing is my favorite and my least painful piercing. It does take a long time to heal but its not a waste of time you just have to clean it well and be careful not to catch it on things. When they pierced mine they have a clasp (it kind of looks like eyelash curlers but not so curved) they clamp it on both sides of your navel and then they pierce it with a hollow needle and slide a barble through the needle and screw the ball on. Mine wasn't painful and I haven't had any problems with it. It's a very quick process to. Like half a minute tops.|`|41HUXSwgaa	Hell no.|`|xn81NJaxaa	I think it looks really cute... it hurts, but its like a split second.. and you'll be sore for like 2 weeks... so it's really up to you.    The only thing bad that ever happened with me was I got mine done when I was 18.. and when I was 22 I had a baby, and even though I took it out way before I got fat.. the hole streched and now it looks different, it annoys me.. but it isnt awful.     They just took pinchers and pulled the skin out and pressed the needle through.. and then just pulled the ring through..    Good luck!!!|`|UtAOJJqsaa	I think if you are questioning getting your belly button peicered, you make up your mind quick because spring break is coming up and then smmer and you dont want to be the only one not allowed in the pool because its still healing    i say do it, i think its flattering on girls, well as long as you dont have a puggy stomach|`|WKRTtYACaa	well mine didnt hurt at all...u can say its played out already but i love mine and i think they look hot! the whole process took about 2 min tops and wasnt painful...just a small pinch. as for the healing process...well u have to make sure to clean it everday with peroxide and then dab on some neosporin. in about 2-3 weeks u should be fine. just make sure u go to professional who uses sterile instruments and is clean!|`|fu4VXe1iaa	NO! it's not beautiful!|`|VQZAxF5Laa	no|`|QMnoPj0zaa	thats hella old. and it always looks trashy

4sVB0efkaa	Oh man...When I got my lip pierced I about passed out. I'm not sure why. Because it doesn't hurt at all.

You will so regret it :S|`|GSZGmH14aa	Well. its either the needle freaked you out or you had a reaction to a sterilizer on the piercing.. first you need to identify what it was if its the needle close your eyes and simply think of something else. take headphones with you so you can go to your own special place. if its the steriziler try using peroxide instead or pure alcohol..|`|GCw0QZ7Saa	Sorry to say it, but you'll pass out. Drink plenty of water :)|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Have you tried getting an anesthetic before the piercing?|`|f0yHJQK5aa	dude thats your body saying STOP!!! LOL.breath slowly in your nose and out your mouth and you should be alright
XgejRqWsaa	you could try watching videos of it over and over again on youtube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1zhqaGFY...    my mom got her ears pierced but she passed out in the middle, and they just finished the other ear when she was out. you could try telling them that if you faint, to finish the job before they try to wake you up.|`|c5anDswjaa	That really sucks! I almost passed out when I got my nips pierced, it was pretty scary.. But I can offer you some tips!    1-Dont watch him prepare the needles and stuff, it will only freak you out even more..    2-Close your eyes when he is coming at you with the needle, again, kinda scary when a sharp needle is comin at your face lol    3- Take deep slow breaths, if he doesnt ask you beforehand, ask if he can pierce you on an exhale.. Ex- "Take a deep breath, now slowly release it *needle through the lip*.. For some reason, it seems to help.    4- After you are done getting them, ask if you can stay seated for a few minutes, maybe bring a sucker or hard candy to eat afterwards (I dont know if you can do that after snake bites).. When I started seeing stars he told me to lay back and eat a sucker and it made me feel better..    5-Bring a buddy with you, its good to have some moral support!|`|d7769329bd0a2936e9a45b35adc6db88aa	don't get them, you won't pass out|`|azNBE4gWaa	if you really want the piercing than go for it. just make sure that who ever is piercing you is well aware the you will most likely pass out.    *try to relax and bring a friend that can keep you calm.  you only live once right? so why not go for what you want even if it means passing out a few times on the way. lol|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Sugar helps you from feeling faint, keeps your sugar levels high.
azNBE4gWaa	definitly go for it. =)    I have 4 in each ear and 2 cartledge piercings, hopeing for a barbell soon.  when your getting your second hole pierced leave in the earrings in your 1st. it helps measuring so the person piercing your ears can be more acurate so both ear piercings will be even on both sides.  I suggest wearing a hoop in the 1st hole and a cute stud in the second. def. cute.   *hope I helped.|`|3cCunajcaa	if your getting it with a gun they will probably ask you to take your earrings out but i doubt they will if you get it done with needle.     i have my ears pierced 3 times. i've learned that some people think it looks good and some don't.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	They made me keep my ear rings on while they marked when they were going to put the wholes. Then had me take them out to do the piercing.|`|a16lpaqGaa	i believe they do make you take them out because they can get in the way. and they do look good. i used to have triples done.|`|Kwhhm53Laa	Yes they do, so they can mark the hole when they pierce it .  & yeah most people look good with it, but if you have  tiny ears then no .|`|5kLsSmRPaa	hey. i have 7 ear piercings (2 on each side in the ear lobe & 3 in the cartilage) and i got my 2nd one done a while ago so i don't really remember if they make u take ur first one out. sorry. i think i took mine out, but im not guarenteeing it :) personally i dont think it would make that much of a difference, but then again i don't pierce people's ears.     of course i think people look good....no awesome(!!) w/ two piercings or however many they happen to want. also if u think u'll look good, go for it :)|`|YAJrXPXuaa	When I got mine done 3 weeks ago they didn't tell me to take out my studs...     I'd say leave them in bcos they might pierce the hole close together...     And I think second ear piercings are cool. But anymore than 3 is just ugly...    xD
R6IYY4miaa	It's not going to smear because the ink is in the skin, not on it. The problem you'll have is keeping your back pretty straight while it scabs, and then rubbing lotion on it for several weeks after wards. It's very important to put lotion on new tattoos a couple times a day for several weeks (depending on location). You'd need someone to put it on your back, help you wash your back in the shower, and check the bandages the first day. If you take the bandages off too early it can pull off the scab which keeps the ink from soaking in and you can have bare spots.|`|Y1K5HAryaa	i have a couple of tattoos...    once the ink is in your skin it doesnt smear. but when youu do start to heal and your skin starts scabbing, the ink can flake off  especially if you keep it covered...my suggestion is if you are going to keep in covere is to put a lot of ointment and every few hours take a soft cloth and clean the ointment with water and soap and re-apply.[so you dont get an infection]... try not to pick at it or scratch because when it scabs and you pull the scab you can take some of the ink out. oh and wen you shower use luke warm water and no scented lotions. towel dry but pat dont rub.
WVylGnL0aa	if you want them to look exactly like that, i would just do it myself. get some jeans that are a stretchy denim, not too stiff, and just use scissors or a knife... but i would practice on a old pair first =)    one of the best places to get colored jeans that are stretchy is PacSun.com    hope it all works out!

wJ45gsyZaa	I've heard this a couple times and I think it really works.  Every morning when you do your make-up or whatever, look in the mirror, pick out one thing you like about yourself and write it down. None of this "There's nothing pretty about me" nonsense, because that's not true. Pick out one thing. Maybe your eyes or your hair, or even something like your fingers or your legs. And just write down "I have beautiful _____."  Try to switch it up everyday. Then, before you know it, you have this long list about all the things that are beautiful about you! And they'll all be true!|`|qTBwonQ4aa	i am honestly the same way. the key is to not let people know that you are self conscious about the way you look. i admire people that walk with their backs straight up and are always smiling. they radiate so much confidence that it makes everyone jealous. ever wonder how the ugly people get hot as heck boyfriends? confidence is key. straighten your back and don't let people take you down when they look at you. usually i look at people thinking about their confidence and how they present themselves to others. but when i get looked at, i just know its because im confident and they are jealous. so keep your head up, back straight, smile and you will be good to go!!:)      also if it is clothes that make you feel more confident, bright popping colors make you stand out and seem bold, trust me, these colors[such as hot pink] will make you feel on top of the world!!!!!!      hope i helped you out:)|`|I1ayVf0Iaa	really don't worry im just the same...  let the beauty come from within,   is the best thing to do and find things in your appearance to be thankful for and start to focus on them when you feel blah about yourself.it makes you appreciate the beauty that's there.    =)  others will see it as well as you.|`|8l52BsB1aa	STOP worrying, I'm sure you're good looking. The world as we know it is a very tough place to feel beautiful cuz we're so surrounded by FAKE beauty, everywhere.  If you go on YouTube you can see tutorials of how much they airbrush models/celebrities for movies, magazines and such. It's CREEPY. So if it's celebrities's looks that are getting you down, just know that they are VERY FAKE.    We all have our 'ugly' days where nothing is working out, and yeah, I don't go very long without looking in a mirror (I mean, what if some fluke happened and I got like, broccoli in my teeth or something?!) but there's a difference between attentiveness and obsessiveness.    Maybe what you need is just more compliments from your friends and fam that you're beautiful.  Tell them that's what you need if you want, just say "hey, I really feel 'loved' when you compliment my looks, could you do that for me?" chances are, if you have good friends (and family), they will, and if you return the favor, they'll feel better about themselves, too!    Hope this helps and you don't think I'm a Shrink Freak or anything...    Ciao!|`|sMLK4hDeaa	Stop buying magazines such as Cosmo and such.....    Really...... Most of your image problems have been put into your mind without you even realizing it..    Did you worry about this stuff when you were 11 or 12?

It's not a very powerful laser, but it does feel like you are being flicked by elastic bands, and the area does get quite hot and sore. It isn't always permanent and takes several goes to clear an area. As for safety, that depends on the type of laser and whether the operator is any good or not.
DFXS4SB4aa	A princess cut is a square diamond, but a "square cut" is not necessarily a princess cut. The terms are not interchangeable. In fact, a radiant cut is frequently square, or close to it.

Princess cut has always and will always be in style.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	YES Square is a princess but and rectangular is emerald cut. Square diamond is comparatively cheaper than the round ones.    But yes they are very popular.    The one shape which is very in today is pear-shaped diamond. They also look great.    BUT if you dont have round or square first go for these as they are classic styles, and post that look for other shapes.    Also check the colour you are choosing as the colour and clarity determine the price of the rock. D is the best quality but very very expensive and rare. You can choose G-H colour that is good enough.    As for clarity, go for VS or above (VVS1 or VVS2).

WVylGnL0aa	to look more casual with boots, i usually tuck my pant legs in. but if that is not possible with these boots, i would wear a casual skirt or even capri's tucked in. you can pretty much dress down shoes with any other clothes you wear. so the more casual clothes you are wearing, the more casual the boots will look =)|`|dsqhGPukaa	you cna just wear them with jeans and like a denim mini ish skirt but like as long as the clothing you choose doesnt look fancy or somthing then it will casualize the boots|`|OBRW9JZhaa	I'd wear them like this:  http://cgi.ebay.com/VINTAGE-Indie-80s-Pu...
ez7QqqfGaa	You should definitely get the first dress! Its so unique and awesome! Plus, nobody will have a dress like it|`|7RHf1ednaa	It really depends on your hair color, for example, brunette, you should go with the green one, same for red heads. If you are blonde go with the pink one. Or if you have multi-colored hair i would go with the pink one.|`|5Slqssqoaa	The green one.     Wish I had the figure for it, it's fabulous!|`|ZgfygNpoaa	they're pretty dresses, but i like the first one better. here's one i like as well http://www.edressme.com/b18021.html|`|ZuD07BKNaa	The mermaid dress is BEAUTIFUL!!

Hope you find the PERFECT prom dress!!|`|3SXSKDuuaa	if its out of the two then definitly the green one its beautiful, but having a look around   this one is absolutely stunning, the shape is perfect   http://www.edressme.com/dresses105903.ht...  or   http://www.edressme.com/b18021.html  or this one which is simple and beautiful   http://www.edressme.com/bh0502.html|`|llamLKgLaa	I think that the green one is the best for making a statement.  It says look at me I'm hot!|`|fu4VXe1iaa	Well I think that the look is one thing, but you have to see the practical aspect of things too, and I think that it may be difficult for you to dance (I suppose you're going to dance at your prom) with the first dress because it seems very tight.     Here are several dresses that I chose from the website:  http://www.edressme.com/448rb.html  http://www.edressme.com/84110.html  http://www.edressme.com/6100r.html  http://www.edressme.com/6120bl.html  http://www.edressme.com/tbp19750.html  http://www.edressme.com/ad6232.html  http://www.edressme.com/ad6209.html  http://www.edressme.com/1211.html  http://www.edressme.com/ocd9171lna.html  http://www.edressme.com/11718b.html|`|xlFVqLEaaa	definitely the green one although the pink one is nice aswell|`|rwQiydoVaa	i really love this one:  http://www.edressme.com/6372.html   this one is really simple but nice.  http://www.edressme.com/1236.html   love these designs. so cute and beautiful.  http://www.edressme.com/19825.html  http://www.edressme.com/950217.html  http://www.edressme.com/6100r.html    soo many to choose from!  have fun at your prom.  :]|`|MlgxVr0saa	personally black is the best color on a girl to me.. depending on your hairstyle.. but it tends to make a girl look white.. all the best dresses i've seen were either black or red..|`|IZKBRqp7aa	i LOVE the green one. it stands out the most!!! its so beautiful.  i also like this one http://www.edressme.com/1318p.html but still the green one better^_^|`|acf2b6b9818bc9a9c4ec1aa812e142faaa	Hi! I will do my best to help.. The green dress, I don't care for. The pink dress is pritty! I found 2 I like also!   See what you think?    http://www.edressme.com/5219s.html    http://www.edressme.com/6130.html|`|v1tHjJ3haa	the green is reaaly pretty, the pink is cute, whichever one matches your skni tone, hair, and eye color (:|`|wKEAH5hyaa	i like the first one.  ps, i saw that this question was posted on the australian yahoo.  since when did australia have proms?  i thought proms were exclusively american.  LOL another country copying us|`|AA10771601	the first one (green) one will hide flaws more. You have to be really toned pull off the peachish one or the material won't lay flat.|`|DWqyK0Mbaa	OooO the first one is really pretty..it would go good w/ u too since you have blonde hair..tho it might kinda look like a peacock :s but its different.. i like it.    The second one is so cliche ive seen that dress so many times..it wont make u stand out.      I would totally go with the first one..i didnt see any other ones that i liked from the website =]|`|xUfRRGM8aa	The first is far better. It is very pretty, but it looks a bit older. Make sure you keep it fresh and youthful by keeping your makeup clean and not dark or heavy. If you accessorize  with the color eggplant or dark violet it will also liven it up.|`|l5wziiicaa	The first is very pretty and unique, I LOVE IT!|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	If you want to make a statement, wear the green one definitely. I can tell you at my formal, hardly any girls wore dresses that extravagant, so you'll definitely stand out. :)    Please don't go with the pink one though, it's a very plain, very popular design. There was definitely a few dresses that style and similar at my formal. :)    By the way, I say formal, not prom, because I live in Australia. :) I'm not just strange! lol    Have fun! :)|`|ITYgBMJPaa	the first one is VERY cute, and different. i've seen a lot of people wearing ones like the second one. good luck!|`|2v60zG5Faa	umm i don't like any of those how bout  http://www.edressme.com/em919.html  that one will stand out certainly.  http://www.edressme.com/5076.html  http://www.edressme.com/86090.html   http://www.edressme.com/8109.html  http://www.edressme.com/46956ylw.html|`|YRTYXfggaa	Definitely the green one!

But go with whta you like best hunn xx    =D have a nice day x|`|DFXS4SB4aa	The second hairstyle looks better. The first is a bit too severe, and makes your face look a bit pudgy. You're cute though hon. I like the first style, but it just doesn't work for your face shape so well.|`|STGu7JAYaa	u r a silly girl|`|oRRIU2Peaa	The 2nd Pic.

07YBD5mJaa	different stores and brands all have different sizes...you may be a size 9 in one brand and a size 5 in another. i would try different stores, different brands, see if their size 7 fits=]|`|Uh2vfl5Uaa	Yes, it is possible to be between sizes. I work at a store that sells alot of jeans, and alot of times people are right in between. You can shrink your size nine jeans in the dryer, and then if you lose/gain a little more weight the size up or down will fit a little better.|`|5LR1RZelaa	Wear the 9's and buy a belt.|`|X9vsoxB2aa	Try an 8.|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	well seeing ur avatar pic u look about 20 yrs old...and if im right, u should be moving out of junior sizing and into women's...u no longer have the body of a teenager, u have a lot more curves than u had when u were 14...therefore it stands that ur clothing should fit to that adjustment of a now woman's body. you might find that u actually fit into women's clothing sizes (misses) a lot better than u do juniors...try a size 8 or 6 in women's and see how they work for u...I moved into women's about at ur age as well. i found that women's clothing sizes fit a lot better than juniors and actually made me look quite a bit better...i had the same problem, my hips and thighs are larger and my waist is significantly smaller, thus always having to buy a size up in the juniors to fit those areas. then the waist wouldn't fit right because it was made for someone a bit straighter so the waist would be a bit too big...switching to women's sizing should solve ur problem as it is time to move on out of the teen section and become a woman.
Xo8sxD9Baa	I had to throw mine away :(  they fell apart! Off to buy new ones today  :)  But cant decide on what colour!?!?|`|3lSgjGzraa	Yes i did but i wore my old ones as when i get them wet they go all rank.  lol.  xx|`|Cqgv9Wx1aa	i wouldnt  , it would probably ruin them.they may be ok if they have been treated.|`|y9z65Rndaa	yup wear them their so warm!|`|wwewpTWDaa	They are great for cold weather if they are waterproofed - i know a lot are not so you have to buy the spray yourself.|`|QlnTwifraa	Fake ones, not a good idea! i wore mine today, and my feet ended up wet!

The were originally made to be summer boots, so that your feet stayed cool, but they also keep you're feet so warm that people tend to wear them all year round!  They might keep your feet dry and warm, but you will TRASH them, and after spending 170 on a pair, im definitley not going to be jumping in the snow!  you could always buy the cheap fake ones, they will keep your feet warm and who cares if they get ruined when they're only a tenner :)  x|`|5C2B23Qnaa	i have real uggs but i dont wont to get them wet cuz they can get ruined ;)|`|xLj4nilXaa	Well I only got them this year so I've never had the chance, but of course I will be! they're too warm and comfy!|`|xlFVqLEaaa	if you want ot then yeah|`|pC2jGRKraa	Actually the original purpose of UGGs were for a indoor slipper type boot in Austrailia.|`|6aw3naCNaa	Yeah I wore them yesterday coz the snow was that deep but this morning i realised they dont look that good now.    Think I might of ruined them :(|`|Xhivbo6zaa	Yes I do and with leg warmers (:|`|tvF86mRDaa	I've got real ones and I wouldn't risk ruining them! They aren't water proof (even if they've been sprayed with protector!) and you'll ruin them if you wear them out! I am so precious about mine and love them so wouldn't want them spoilt!
DITBVWjPaa	If I understand your hair correctly..go tell your hairdresser..that you want a low maintence..flat cut...you can wake up and either brush or still curl it if you choose...most women look good with a shag razor cut...ask and look at mags and pictures...dont be unrealistic if the girl in the pic has thick curly hair...look for models that resemble your hair..that is more realistic....xxoo|`|bihM07K9aa	well i think you could loose a little bit of hte length but not alot of it because u might regret it after. but i think you should get it layered. have the longest layer be right in the middle of your bakc nad the shortest right about your sholders. as far as styling goes, just add a little bit of gel or something and scrunch it and go! hope i could help =]]]|`|vsKrGw2caa	go say all of that to a stylist while your in chair.I think that s best bet

4vqzkIr4aa	First of all your choice of inks are garbage. MOMs only has good blues or green. All pelican is cheap crap. And well prizm, run from that cheap superior tattoo starter crap. I suggest Alla Primo (new and the best I have used - great for washing), Intenze, Natural, DMC, StarBright.    When washing black for good fading using ur small cups make one solid, another 10 drops of black, and another 5 drops of black and wash with distilled water or green soap. The thing to use to mix, in your ink cup, is the loop from a needle bar. Put the loop end of the bar in the ink cup and spin in your fingers.    The main reason you are not getting good wash-outs is the cheap ink you are using. Some inks are expensive for a reason|`|98NiEivhaa	distilled water.... that's it, that's all|`|rtx0YQDJaa	do not use detol!! that is a strong disinfectant...you could seriously damage somebody's skin by using that to do gray wash. all you have to do is fill a cap with black ink and get your self a cup of water. dip in the black and dip it in the water to water it down....that is how you do gray wash. if your unsure of how many times to dip to get the desired shade set out a series of caps and make your shades seperatley by dropping some ink in each and topping it off with water. you can also try turning your machine down..sometimes the problem is just how your machine is running. it takes time to get good...practice makes perfect.

AA10246871	In any push-up device (pads, a bra, etc.), the heaviest part goes at the bottom and to the side (outside) of your natural breast. That forces your breasts together, to create cleavage, and pushes them up, to make them look perky.    I don't need any help in that department, but I looked at the website so I could see exactly what you're talking about.    You'll want to put them in with the heavy, rounder part at the bottom of your bra, and sort of to the side, so you have cleavage. That will make you look like you have a larger breast than you do, and will make you look nice and full.    Go try them on right now, and make sure you can get them in right. It may take some adjusting to get them to look natural and feel comfortable. But do it tonight, because you may find that your bras won't fit if the shapers are too big.    Good luck.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	No, but I really like naked.|`|AA10289917	You didn't ask, but young women using this device should be slim with small breasts.

Don`t bother with the tad bit darker, you will just be wasting money and time. For color to have a noticeable difference you need to go at least 3 shades darker. Color fades fast if you are not using a non-sulfate shampoo. I recommend going to a Professional, and request a demi color(semi permanent) When a client says tad bit darker to me I say go home and come back when your serious...;o) by the way...black color is not har to take out, in fact the easyiest.

amaxY22uaa	Hey! I have had about three pairs of Uggs now and I love them! they are so warm and cosy and dont make you walk funny on the side. the reason the cheap ones do that is because they dont have a proper sole or back to keep them straight.  For the really tall ones, its about 170   for the shorter, mid-length ones, they're around 140.  I'd suggest getting them in a shop rather than online, as you cant be sure they are real online as there are many good fakes about.  You can get them in shops like office, footasylum, schuh or most designer selling stores.    If you're lucky, (and if you're a student) some stores will give you 10% off with a vaild student card.    I would definitely recommend getting some, they might be expensive but they will last you soo long if you take care of them, unlike the pirmark ones which make you walk funny and last about 3days!   Hope you find some!  x|`|xpOTJzKYaa	www.nikestorevip.com|`|zon13nY2aa	You can buy genuine Ugg boots from stores on the high street like Office, Schuh, Jones the Bootmaker..

People who end up "walking on the sides" tend to be people who don't pick their feet up properly when they walk and shuffle along. You could probably do exactly the same thing with a pair of UGGs if you tried.|`|hfr9rLjkaa	Hiya,I brought my UGGs from The ugg store in West field,But you can also buy from all Office shoe shops.Ugg boots do not do what the cheap ones do (don't that look bad!) lol you just wanna tell the person to stop wearing them!!!   Yeah the black are really nice and last longer cause of the colour.  They range from130.00 to 180.00 depending on what ones you go for.I know some people hate them but i love mine! so enjoy! xx|`|SB5Y1gM9aa	I own two pairs. The first were the long chestnut ones which are around 160. However, I bought them in the USA and they were $160 so big savings were made! I got them in a department store there, so if you know anyone heading to America give them the money to get you a pair for loads cheaper!    The second pair I got were the short grey ones. I bought them from asos when they were having a 10% off everything promotion so saved about 20. I would reccommend asos for them, you know you're getting the genuine article and you can wait until they have a promo and get some money off them. Good luck.    P.S Real Uggs don't collapse. I've had my first ones for over two years and they haven't collapsed like the primark ones.|`|3lSgjGzraa	I get mine from Barrats. i know they're closing down but you might be able to get them cheap! i got mine for 40 but they are amzing! i have 2 pairs, black and beige and have had them both for over 2 years.

cdy5uIE5aa	What you're wearing sounds good to me. I'm sure a lot of your classmates are wearing something similar.  Just don't dress like a skank or wear too much make-up.  If you did this they might be more prone to talk to you but they might be less likely to respect you.|`|AA10929474	I prefer modest, cute.  No sluttiness please though.  Just sickens me.

dJJLfOHFaa	Plastic surgery would be by far the best solution.    Sure, make-up might help in pictures, together with the way the light falls on your face. But it won't help much in real life.    Instead, if you do not want to venture into cosmetic surgery, you can accentuate you best feature instead.    If your best feature is your eyes, then apply more mascara (or fake lashes) and brush.  1. Always curl lashes before applying mascara.  2. Don't forget your bottom lashes. It helps to make eyes pop.  3. For a doe-eyed look, line your lower lids with a creamy white eye pencil. 'Estee Lauder Artists's Eye Pencil in White Writer' ($18.50) is good.  5. White liner may sound odd, but it really opens up the eye. You can also try putting it on the inside corner of both your upper and your lower lids.  6. Another way to open up eyes is to skip the white eyeliner and opt instead for a platinum highlighter. Dot along the browbone, then blend in. Apply highlighter at the inner corners of your eyes. Follow with eye shadow.  7. Make sure your brows are manicured. Until you get your brows professionally waxed, tweezed or threaded, you won't realize how much they affect the rest of your face. Cleaning up your brow line of stray hairs, adding a slight arch and filling in sparse spots are key to making eyes look much larger.    If your best feature is the lips, then try a lip gloss or go several shades darker on lips. Rich red shades make lips look fuller than neutral ones.    For longer-lasting pout, try going for botox. It lasts for about a year. But remember to go to a professional. It's safer that way.|`|nGkCWpRVaa	plaster of paris|`|mXpaE6V6aa	I would recommend dramatizing other things on your face.  Like dramatic eye makeup to draw the eye away from your nose. Make something else on your face the focal point, like a bold lip gloss or something. Or a rosy cheek.   I wouldn't recommend making everything dramatic at once, we don't want you to be a clown walking around with too much makeup on. Focus only on one part of your face to accentuate.|`|5f0ad33d9668eff665c2e087d8f3dc2caa	You could wear a witches hat and pretend to be a wicked witch, no one will notice your lumpy bumpy nose then :)|`|7u8ZOWnqaa	if you have money for rhinoplasty i'd just go get that done. less hassle, you'll fix the problem and be done with it. you just need to get into a reputable doctor. look at many of his before and after photos and go in for a consultation, see if he can help. otherwise,    yes theres makeup shading but that helps moreso in pictures and in certain light yes you'll just see dark powder on your nose. just do what would make your nose symmetrical. if you think about where the shading should go it's pretty easy. the dark shadow will make that spot it's put on recede. also, wearing really extravagant eye makeup will distract people from your nose a bit, just gotta make sure it's tasteful. maybe go crazy with some sexy fake eyelashes. but idk i think surgery is best option. good luck|`|ZPfCk0sZaa	I think you can watch this video at http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=18... it is about applying make up and i think you can watch this video at http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=18...  it is about how to create a smoky eye this to keep the attention for your nose to your eyes i think when you make your eyes beautiful the focus will be on them not your nose and this video at http://www.mytopclip.com/play.php?vid=19...  it is about the secrets of make up i think it can help you and you can read this article at http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...  it is about beauty care products and this article also at http://articles.onlineweblibrary.com/Art...  it will help you to do every thing from your home best wishes|`|91AMtKEraa	There is other thing in life to worry about|`|sYn2n9dYaa	if thats all u have to worry bout. my liver is on the outside...|`|HIn1p4OBaa	i don't know if you can, but don't worry about it. nobody's really gonna care.|`|7d9498750ad0c1c14a0c3174f0178a6baa	If people can see if you're not blending it in enough :-(  Instead of bronzer or a dark powder- try and darker foundation instead?

XtSvbsoiaa	It does not always leave an extremely noticeable hole or scar, although I have seen some that have. I think alot has to do with the piercer you choose to do the piercing, if it is done correctly there should be very minimal scar tissue which makes it heal and close up much nicer. I myself have had both my eyebrow & nose pierced and eventually decided to take them out, and even I have to look extremely close in the mirror to even see the tiny little marks left behind. Definitely choose your piercer wisely and be sure to check out some of his previous work personally before you allow them to pierce you, it;s worth it.|`|2VtkgzcIaa	I took out my tongue ring about 2 years ago and you can still see the hole... Since it's my tongue, it doesn't really bother me, but if it were on my lips or eye brow, it would really bother me. There will definitely be a scar, but it depends on your skin tone how noticeable it is.|`|X2zq30SGaa	From my personal point of view, don't get a lip ring. It looks extremely tacky. Plus, won't it get in the way while you're talking and chewing?Gross, huh?!    But with that being said, ear piercings look pretty and natural. Just don't get more than 2 on each ear. With too many, it will look junky.|`|UoMdPH3iaa	No.. thay close with time|`|HIwJFtNlaa	I've had earlobe piercings and they're fine. they didn't scar.  cartilage piercings shouldn't scar or you can't see it at least. Nose piercings like... not septum ones probably wouldn't scar, at least not badly. if anything just a little scar. and Monroe would likely scar. and lip piercing would likely scar. eyebrow piercings wouldn't show as much.   my mom's a RN [registered nurse] and she says any muscle piercing will scar.  lips and monroe and eyebrow.   Bridge obviously will.  those weird piercings like.. the arm piercings..likely will scar.  and i can't say for plugs.|`|kQMt51iraa	Ya there will be a mark. The holes will be closed but you can see a hole like mark over there.  I have one on my nose. i Got it pierced when i was in school 9-10 years old. Now i am 27 but still have that mark.|`|yPMPx78waa	i no that many piercings take 2-3 years after it is actually done, to completely heal. so you can take your piercing out any time before that if you change your mind.    most piercing holes you dont even notice anyway(:|`|1d1f9e73380d791a93b958e05d0a1b9faa	the questione is how old are you.    2nd dont mess w. ur face.  it better natural    3rd why have if ur going to close it    4th YES it leavea a mark.    =D
gOm09Bqsaa	just take in a picture with you, and they will do what they can. if they dont think it will be possible, then they will be able to tell you.    hope this helps   x x x|`|cJDc1UGTaa	I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem doing that to your hair even though it is darker. A bunch of my friends had super dark brown hair and went for a lighter color, and it came out just fine.    As far as describing it to a hair dresser, why don't you just print out a picture of the girl who plays Blair? If you don't have a printer, you could probably go to a friends and print it out.    If not, you could just describe it to her like you did to us; it seemed like a good enough description to me!
vQXYqNkgaa	If you put bandaids on them, they'll grip your feet better.   Stick them to the back of the heel, the part that hits your Achilles. The texture will stop slippage, and the extra cloth will hug your feet better. Sometimes I use two or three. It's not noticeable and works great.|`|AA12133586	hair spray inside ur shoe|`|zQQd2wPRaa	Wear Gold Bond power. Sprinkle a few flakes into the shoe to keep them dry.

I soak in oatmeal and then rub some of the flakes around where I've started to peel. It usually takes care of it for me. Also, if you have lots of honey... mix honey and smoothly ground salt or powder of some kind and start rubbing after liberally soaking for at least an hour in hot water. It should help with the exfoliation process and will leave your skin really smooth. At least, it does for me.     Unfortunately, I can't answer your third question, I am not sure what you mean by black boundaries around your finger nails. You could get a cuticle remover and try that.|`|O88ja9GZaa	You know..  1) Apply some lemon extract on those places..hmm dont mix water, this will lighten those tans away and give a shine to your skin  2) manicure ur nails properly(see tips thru google search engine)  and if u r fair go for some dark colours to do away with the dark lines !  (well apply lemon extrct thr as well )  Hope this helps ya!(PS.Do apply regularly..for arnd 15 mints!)|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Exfoliate every 2 days till its gone,  and also put lemon juice on yourself.    Or you could always just run down to the shops and get a tan illuminizer or whatever its called - that gets rid of the tan.|`|UYSPKHbAaa	Exfoliation in every 2 days is the best option  as u're very young so ur skin is very gentle so don't overdo or select wrong product or it will ruin ur skin 4 future  use any body Scrub & scrub it lightly,    use lemon juice best & effective  Drink At least 2 glass of lemon juice every day(help u 2 remove present tanning & avoid future tanning)  Rub lemon juice/skin on ur body every day

And posssibly straighten it, your hair wouls look so nice like that and it would suit your face. It beats spikes anyday. (:|`|cJDc1UGTaa	Like the person above me said, you should grow out your hair and straighten it, maybe have that side swept action going on. That's pretty hot. :P    As far as spikey goes, this is a good style if your hair is long enough... I couldn't really tell.  http://i234.photobucket.com/albums/ee136...

And when your hair grows a few inches : http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_XAePxwGya7E/Rw...
8osMkLe1aa	I can't see the picture but if your hair is flipping rather than curling it's probably because you're holding it horizontally. Try holding the curling iron vertically and that should help. Another problem could be if you are using a very wide barrel. I have shoulder length hair and when I tried to use a 2" curling iron it didn't work because my hair couldn't wrap around the barrel enough times.|`|HHnQyjFBaa	Your link is dead, sorry!

This is my 5th tattoo. The colour will look like its coming off, but its just the scab and the colour is underneath, dont worry.|`|98NiEivhaa	i think you're overwashing it for one...  and the little bumpies are commonly from too much lotion, maybe back down a notch, try 3 or 4 times a day  the rest is normal, enjoy|`|vja4ddNmaa	That peeling is normal, I bet you can even see some of the ink in the flakes that peel off, I did. OK, stop washing with antibacterial soap use natural soap with no chemicals, and keep it moist with 100% pure cocoa butter (the kind that comes in a stick). Can't say anything about the uneven skin, try going back to the shop you got the tat at and talking with them.      1: No sun exposure for 3 weeks (very important)   2: No swimming for 2 weeks    I know what I writing about believe it if you want.|`|N19mmDELaa	dont peel it! you'll pull the color. its normal for it to peel alittle. its an open wound thats healing. and its ok that it has color in it. just keep applying the lotion and keep it clean! it'll heal in 7 to 10 days..     good luck!
Uhyu3iCbaa	I agree.  I'm not a vegetarian, so I do eat meat, but skinning is only for vanity purposes.  I don't see how having a dead animal's fur is status item.  It doesn't look that attractive anyway, cruelty aside.|`|07YBD5mJaa	I agree.  no animal should be killed for a fashion accessory.|`|Z5sKsrBFaa	An innocent animal has to die so someone can look ridiculous.|`|fpv8IV3Haa	china are the biggest in animal cruelty. go on youtube and you can see lots of animal cruelty in mostly china. Something needs to be done.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	I think it is really bad that people wear animals fur, I mean how could you live with the fact that your fur coat has killed innocent animals.    I think they should make fur clothes illegal!    xx|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	i happily and acceptingly use fur to keep myself warm and only for that reason, ive never used fur for vanity only. the only vanity involved is what fabric do i pick out to go over the coat or how do i want my sewing and beading done. ive used it as a necessity...im an inupiaq (eskimo commonly known) and in -40 (or less) degrees, its nessary to stay alive to have fur and skins for ur clothing...our culture has a very different perspective on animals and humans than u think happens...its quite a spiritual event to out culture...we not view ourselves higher than the animal...we actually love the animal we kill and use every part we can use to eat or to feed others...you would have to read about it and live there to find out that its not just "barbarians" that kill animals, wear the fur and throw the rest away like it was not a living creature before it was killed.|`|2W8Nxao3aa	so cruel ~,~    totally disagree with wearing animal skin as clothes, in the whole universe only human beings will skin an animal not for the food, but for the sake of looking high class and cool on it~ wat a jerk!!!|`|C6m2RTZjaa	it is definatly not. i hate it too. its stupid. why cant people understand that an animal had to die just for them to have a coat or whatever? its so sad to see someone wearing an animal like that. if i offend anyone by this, im sorry. bu this is just my opinion|`|QYn2hVgYaa	i hate people who say its horrible then i see them wearing designer boots or bags or fur there hypocrites  i am 100% vegan i don't wear any clothing made of animals i don't do anything pertaining to animals. you should join peta|`|NVSambhPaa	I think that real fur coats look pretty riduculous, so it is pointless and cruel to skin animals for that. But to be completely honest, I do have one leather purse. But majority of my feelings go towards not skinning animals for fashion purposes.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	ITS A SHAME that fashion crazy girls dont have enough compassion to respect life of other living beings and get the poor animals killed for their Louis Vuitton bags and Jimmy Choo shoes.    It is so disheartening to see the poor animal to go through so much just because some incompassionate people have to fulfill their sensous reckless desires.    Check this girls: http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/01...    You can be fashionable and also buy luxury bags without killing those poor animals.

YCeI6auxaa	http://www.polyvore.com/outfit_for_justm...|`|HIwJFtNlaa	what's your dress code?  i recommend something simple.   maybe a tube top, or a white spagetti shirt and black shorts with some sort of white design possibly? or just plain denim and white converse.  and get glow sticks and break them and apply the gooey gross stuff on your body it'll show at the dance x)  and like a cute white headband. and maybe curl your hair and spray some white hair dye or something in it.
Ln4FLAMEaa	It could be because the hair a the root is newer than the tip hair. The hair at the tip is more dead and weak so may have taken the bleach on more than the roots.  Why don't you try waxing? Seems painful but it lasts up to 6 weeks and looks great|`|HsL0PYNGaa	because the hair is growing back again!  or because of the contact with the skin and stuff. or a bad bleach thing.|`|0h6gDgSWaa	Well, I recommend Joleen bleach, it`s awesome! As far as the roots, well hair grows back, so you will see it grow back. You are 14, this is a great time to start waxing. Before you develop all your hormones. If you start young waxing the chances of your hair growing back is slim. The younger you start waxing the better. It will last 2 Solid weeks before you see any out growth. Then of course the more you go the longer it stays gone. It does not grow back stubbly and you WILL not grow more. You will love it!! You might be able to get it done cheaper at a beauty collage. I think the average price would be about $40. Well that's our price at our salon I`m from Cali.
AA12117293	face wash, toner, and moisturizer are definitely the right track to be on!     One thing you can try is drinking a lot of water to flush out your system from whatever caused this reaction on your skin.|`|KSn1grK1aa	Apply rose water and sandalwood..  Milk cream may also help but see to it that its fresh and cold...|`|glaUnXgsaa	make sure you don't pop your pimples unless its' a true white head, and when you do don't use your fingers, but use a clean q tip. then wash your face immediately after popping out the white crap. otherwise it will just seep into your surrounding pores and just make more pimples.    don't wear any foundation until then [idk if you're a guy or girl]    wash your face regularly and DON'T TOUCH YOUR FACE    exfoliate your skin. st ives apricot scrub works best for me.|`|wiBQmpFRaa	it may sound girly but wear foundation i know heaps of guys that wear foundation ot you could use concealer    hope this helps    Xx    ilt|`|CUt6AqJHaa	Keep up your regiment! Don't listen to the person that says not to moisturize, that is a bad idea. Your skin will start producing more oil, due to the lack of moisturizer and then your pores will clog even more leading to more pimples. Try to eat healthier too, things like avocado it has good fat and is good for your skin,stay away from the really greasy foods and keep your self hydrated. Also, for some people, eating lots of chocolate can cause pimples. I have a friend like that.    Remember, don't change products last minute, you don't know how your face will react.|`|ltSQ8SoXaa	don't use moisturizer its even worse for your skin it blocks your pours mixed with your oil causing pimples don't do it!!! Clean your face with cold water in the morning to get rid of dirt and oil. It works    Oh yeah and use Aloevera on your pimples it heals it fast

Jobs are scarce, and you want to make an impression.|`|mhsr6zCZaa	ALWAYS wear a skit to work! Pencil skirts are fabulous, as are some of the puffball skirts out at the minute. I usually attend work in either of the latter with either a t-shirt or a shirt and a waist belt, heels once I get there (flats for rushing for the train!) and a cute neck scarf and a watch! Simple yet always effective!

kAuQugVKaa	That to look beauty you needn't to wear skirts or heels, especially if you don't feel comfortable in them!   Try to be yourself! Try to find more nice and pretty jeans and T-shirts for your daily life! More important not to look ideal way but that you feel confident! You are special and unique!   As for problems with your face, try to use some special cosmetics like tonics and creams that it looks better. You know most people have problems with face's skin in their teenager's age and after some time you will not have these problems. But you need to watch over your skin on your face!  I'm sure that everything will be ok just believe it! ;-)|`|CUt6AqJHaa	Well, I think its dependent upon you and what you want to wear! I understand that wearing a skirt is weird, I was like that too, lol. Just wear some nice slacks and cute top. Where a cute top that flatters your figure and for the slacks, make sure they fit you at your widest part and then you could always have them taken in and adjusted where it is bigger. For shoes, no need to wear heels, unless you want to, there are so many cute flats out there! I hope this helps!     I am sure your pores are not that big and besides, you are only 16! I don't what the weather is like where you live but always wear moisturizer, it will help with your pores. I personally like Clinique products, they are terrific and are not that expensive.     As for plucking, you could try making a date at a salon and having it done professional.|`|Jh0yyYizaa	Being curvier is sexier than being skinny,  trust me, and lots of guys would agree.     You should exfoliate every 2-3 days on the days leading up to the party, and do a lot of exercise to get clearer and healthier-looking skin.     A dress that shows off your shape would be great,  but make sure you go instore and try different ones on before you pick one. Perfect excuse to go shopping!  Have fun =D|`|AenRh1eRaa	Work out. whats plucked?|`|x2ykq6ePaa	well, you could get a pair of black or pin striped straight leg pants(with wide legs), and a nice dressy sweater.i don't know what your size is, but lane bryant starts at 14/16 and they have awesome clothes.  also, if you get a plainish sweater, you could always get a wide black belt to go over it. and black shoes.  about your pores, you should get a pore minimizing facial scrub, a skin toner,and a good lotion.  Cover girl puts out a foundation with a blue cap, that is for oily skin, you don't need oily skin to use it, it's just a good cheap foundation.|`|yPMPx78waa	clarify, cleanse and moisturise your face everyday twice a day.   wear a dress or somin?    but honestly you don't need to change yourself for a party.|`|OFI8o2xHaa	Is it really necessary to change who you are for a party ?

As for heels, I don't suggest you wear them unless you are confident that you can walk properly or else you will either look ridiculous, or break your ankle.|`|Hqksr02Saa	What u should concentrate on already beautiful Ellie, is your personality. Don't worry about your looks, dont build your vanity. You sound sincere, be there for your friend. No one will judge you if you are beautiful inward, because it takes a true someone to be just that. You sound amazingly beautiful in all ways already but dont shatter that. If people tease you in anyway its because they are jealous what you do is you go up to them and you say, 'Hey look, here's my mobile, call opera, someone who cares.'Then walk off. Forget them. Especially if they are girls,..If they are guys stuff them too.  Are you religous? Tie your connections to god he will lead you...and you will learn the true meaning to everything. I found a bit of the inner peace I can have and it feels good.  I know you want to look good, trust me. I come from the background of a country where if you dont look good they harass your mother - tell her that she doesnt take care of you...make her feel bad. It pisses me of that these people of my religion think so highly of beauty. But then again................

Because actually you don't. You can actually wear some kind of dolly shoes or flat shoes that are stylish. But like everyone has been saying be a natural beauty, because like I always say to my friends when they feel down about their appearance, Just think to yourself " Well I'd rather be a natural beauty, than a fake one" Because fake ones just don't act like their selves and they plaster on make-up which makes them totally fake. I mean a little make-up is okay but when it becomes too much its ridiculous.     But honey just go shopping if you wanna get a hot dress, but get something that you are comfortable in not something you are squeezing your butt in, you will be in pain all night and you wont be that happy. Honestly eyebrows can enhance your beauty if trimmed properly but don't go to those lengths if you really don't feel okay with it, cause trust me half of the things that women go through to look beautiful is just not worth it. But have fun if you still wanna go and Good Luck, just remember you're beautiful, Naturally. (((And this is coming from a 14 year old girl in grade 10)))
aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	It would depend on the type of party and how old you are.|`|BKv1LGY9aa	A t-shirt, shorts and a pair of flip flops, you cant go wrong!|`|cGazG1Tuaa	If you live in a hot country like mine..    Wear short, stylish shorts (yes try not to wear b&w stuffs coz it looks very dull). And a simple tank-top or shirt would do the trick. Flip-flops or canvas shoes are good.|`|OBRW9JZhaa	I love the outfits this site puts together:  http://stores.ebay.com/VeritableVintage-...|`|883108753f719db568096c99c5335aadaa	clothing.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Dressing for a party?    well this information will sure provide you some good tips and advice: http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2008/12...|`|rIei2AsOaa	well it depends on what kind of a party it is.|`|gerV8XfFaa	what kind of a party?|`|S9A2WLFGaa	well, i'd go for a plain white tank top, with a denim highwaisted skirt. for accessories go with a tan belt around your waist and gladiator sandals. if it's too cold, wear some black opague tights underneath the skirt and ditch the sandals for some cute ballet flats

Get some badges or patches or safety pins to pin onto it, wear with some bright ripped tights! buy a cheap pair from primark.    For a top, maybe a bright yellow ripped up again. You could rip the front and safety pin the rip together. Or maybe get some paint and put some writing on a cheap or old t shirt.    For accessories though check out this http://lvejewellery.bigcartel.com    The zip earrings would be good, or the belts!|`|dBuLIdtcaa	wear a lot of eye liner and something black...put your hair up (assuming your a girl) or gel it up crazy (assuming your a guy)    shamwow. there it is.|`|7RHf1ednaa	Umm...actually there are some other colors, like hot pink, basically neon colors. Those are pretty colorful, and you could wear some neon skirt, black and neon shirt. Definitly some eyeliner, you could also just put clear lipgloss on. Also, get some clothing that has some thing musical with it.|`|8l52BsB1aa	Wear eyeliner (if you can't buy regular eyeliner pencils etc. ask a girl friend if you can borrow theirs for it or use dark eyeshadow rubbed right above your eyelashes on the top and right underneath the bottom eyelashes. The more the merrier for punk)  Wear a sleeveless, solid colored shirt and layer stuff over it like belts, chains (it helps if you own dogs and can use their choker collars), etc.   Wear black or red nailpolish, also the combo of Black Red and Pink nail polish will look good.  Wear really dark lipstick.    If you have any removable tattoos, you could put a few in various places like your arms and such.    For pants, go for baggy cargo or old tight skinny jeans.    For hair: put into two high ponytails (if you have long enough hair...doesn't have to be really long) and tease to make poofy. If you wear enough eyemakeup, the ponytails won't look at all too childish and will really add to the costume.  If you can get your hands on washable hair color spray, you can spray the ponytails with it. Recommend colors are: Purple, Red, Blue and Pink.    All of this advice comes from a person who dressed up as a Punk/Goth/Vampire and did it so well that it scared her boyfriend. Hehe. Cuz, I'm usually a girlygirl.    Ciao!

cfcuBxdsaa	are you talking about the lotion then the answer is no you'd better off getting some natural cocoa butter in the stick form and you have to apply it at least three to four times a day and don't expect immediate results it can take up to two months to start seeing results and it requires continuous use.|`|50qgybd5aa	if you buy the right kind it will work !  http://www.scleroderma.org/images/medica...  if it smells like cocoa & very good, that's the good kind  you can find it at wal-mart .  you have to apply the cocoa butter after every time you shower  or just everday for a month or two for it to work, & stretch marks  dont just go away, they just end up fading & turning white  so if you can, tanning will help them less noticable .|`|JDA6u7kTaa	Probably not. I bought it and hated the smell so much I threw it out. Smell it for yourself before you waste your money.|`|Krrt4E2Maa	yepp!  i love that stuff to pieces.   you should try their body gloss ^_^
vp9dHjQkaa	I know this sounds gross, but I swear it will work:  Mix 2 parts mayonnaise and 1 part lemon juice thoroughly, and put it in your hair.  Go out in the sun (wear sunscreen!) and let the lemon juice lighten your hair.  The mayo will moisturize your hair too.  Rinse it out afterwards.  Alternatively, just put equal parts lemon juice and water in a spray bottle and spray your hair before you go out in the sun (Just make sure you get sun all over, not just on top of your head).  It will gradually lighten your hair.  It's a little drying though, so don't skimp on conditioner.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Dye, a product for fabrics, shouldn't be used on hair.    I think you had used a permanent hair colour.  It does not "wear off" -- it is permanent.  It has changed your hair forever.  What part of "permanent" didn't you understand?    You didn't really have golden blond hair.  You have forgotten what it was like.  Your hair would have been bleached by the sun, and appeared golden blond.  You are seeing your regrowth, the true natural colour, and it is darker than you remembered.  But it hasn't been exposed to the sun yet.    The only thing you can do is let it all grow out.  All the way out.  This is going to take a year at least to get some length to it.  The ends will always be coloured.  The only way to get rid of it is to cut that hair off.    Because I can't see your hair from here, and because I don't believe it is a dull brown, you should have a consultation with a hair colourist and tell them what you would like.  They may have a suggestion about how to get it.  I would not want to bleach your hair at this stage!  You cannot make it lighter without a bleach -- even if you want to call it by another name, bleach is still bleach.  You may need to use a colour remover (only removes artificial colour), but you may not like what you get after that.    The best thing to do is let it grow out.  You will go through an awkward stage, but believe me, that is really the best way to do it.|`|XSTVl0kMaa	After some of the hair 'color' (not dye) wore off, some was left in the cuticle, thus your hair having that dull, brown color. In order to strip your cuticle of that color you have to take your hair to a higher level, therefore lightening your hair (aka bleach!). That's the only thing you can do. :( I would suggest Paul Mitchell bleach if you do re lighten your hair due to the very low level of ammonia. More ammonia, more damage. Remember, if you sleep with a silk pillowcase, wash your hair no more than 2 to 3x per week, and do deep conditioning treatments, you'll hair will be the healthiest it's ever been. I wish you luck! Stay fab!|`|5Hb20PZKaa	You have to get it grow out. a home dye is sitting in the run with straight lemon juice in your hair, but it is essentially bleaching it. It works pretty well.|`|lcfOYn2Faa	Wow. Well I've got a tip but im afraid there is nothing that will bring your blond hair better than dying it. 1.) You can use those John Frieda Collection Shampoos for Blondes. 2.) You can use a "Manzanilla" shampoo that they sell at your local walgreens store they have like a teddy bear on it. I hope this helps!  *CrzyShopaholic13*|`|lc9nus8taa	just wait    and DON'T ever go in saleriums (tanning beds) you'll literally kill yourself!!|`|2ZBlNEkbaa	Your hair gets lighter the more time you spend in the sun. If you go to the tanning bed wear your hair down it will lighten up slowly. You most likely wont see it go completely back to normal until this summer. Other then that theres not a lot you can do unless you dye it.

But if you have hardly any clothes that will go with the colour magenta get black, because everything goes with black. ^^|`|WVylGnL0aa	high tops never go out of style and plus they are super cute! =)|`|y075ayrKaa	looks like im the tie breaker...  go with the magenta because people will compliment you more and  they stand out!|`|QMnoPj0zaa	black high tops  you will proble be able to wear them  more often, since everything goes with black!|`|fsddd1paaa	Whichever pair will suit more clothes you have/are planning to wear with them. Good luck, and enjoy your shoes once you get them. :)|`|iuCYJuKGaa	Well, it really depends.  I TOTALLY hate it when girls who wear really girly clothes have punk shoes!

3lSgjGzraa	I did that!! i bought a brown hair dye and it came out black!!  don't worry, just put up with people asking "why have you dyed your hair black? Are you and emo?" for a while.  After a while, the more you wash it, the lighter it'll get.  I did it about 6 months ago ang my hair is almost blonde again! and it was permenant!  I know its a shock, but i'm sure you look lovely!  hope this helps =]  xx|`|FwJLD1uDaa	:-O dye it back.. good luck!!|`|AEF5Hj4faa	Go to a hair salon place   And let them dye it for you so u dun get the wrong colour again. o;|`|tcQFoez9aa	The black the probably eventually get lighter if you had a light brown hair.  If not, get a toner, at a salon, or go see a stylist. But i shouldn't worry too much.|`|PeNTl6KOaa	ohh, um go to the hairdressers and explain ur sutuation, they will sort it out    x|`|YFiBGarkaa	Go to the hairdressers simple answer!  Dont try and do it yourself again because youll be unhappy and those home dye kits are so damaging more damaging then the ones they use in the salon!|`|IyuCfuNTaa	they sell color removal but also you can try this at home.. what you will need....  liquid laundry detergent   leave-in conditioner   clarifying shampoo   tomato juice   Shower cap   How to Remove Hair Dye Naturally  Step1Utilize some liquid laundry detergent and leave-in conditioner. Wet your hair and wash it like you normally do, just substitute laundry detergent for your shampoo. Repeat this several times before drying your hair. Stay away from detergents that have bleach or color protectors; bleach could burn your skin and color protectors defeat the purpose.   Step2Pat your hair dry and apply the leave-in conditioner liberally to your hair.   Step3Use clarifying shampoo. Swimmers use these products regularly to keep chlorine from damaging their hair. These shampoos remove build up and chemicals from your hair, including hair dye. You can find them everywhere from the drugstore brands to salons. Wash your hair like you normally do, using the clarifying shampoo. Use it as often as your hair can tolerate. Follow up clarifying shampoo with extra conditioning because they can leave your hair dry and frizzy.   Step4Soak your hair in tomato juice if your hair color disaster has left you with green hair. All you need is some tomato juice from the grocery store and a shower cap. Saturate your hair with tomato juice and cover it with the shower cap to keep the juice from leaking out. Keep the juice in for 30 minutes and rinse well. Follow up with conditioner. Since the tomato juice wont damage your hair as much as your other options, you can repeat this process if you need to.   Step5Treat your hair with oil. This is an excellent way to heat your hair since heat fades hair color. You need olive oil from the grocery store and plastic shower cap. Generously apply the olive oil to your hair from roots to tips. Cover with the shower cap and use your hair dryer to generate heat. Continue heating the oil for 20-30 minutes before rinsing the treatment out of your hair. here is something else for you to read..................i personally would NOT do this it can really fry your hair bleach is not good but here is another one you can try...    As said, the most difficult color to be removed is black hair dye.   For removal of black hair dye or any other dark shade of hair dye you can take a small amount of bleach and add two table spoons of shampoo to it. Stir properly. Now apply this mixture on your hair and knead the hair. The color will disappear immediately. If you are not the one who has always handled bleaching agents, it is advisable that you take help of a professional. Go to a salon and get rid of the hair dye color. These professionals will bleach your hair and also condition your hair to treat your hair that has turned quite weak by bleaching.  GOOD LUCK GABBY :)|`|g6ASHHTcaa	i dyed my hair this burgundy colour once and i got out of the shower and my hair was really red as in red red not orange red.  it was due to hair not being fully washed out and it eventually faded after a few days and washes  so make sure you washed the dye out good =)|`|0h6gDgSWaa	You need a color remover, but doing this may turn your hair orange if you don`t know what you are doing. Your scalp and head has the most body heat and will activate it fast. If you can not afford to go to a professional then I suggest diluting the color stripper. Most will call for 10-20 volume peroxide and 2 oz of bottles water. Use 10vol. You can add more water to dilute. After you are done soap cap your hair with 10 volume peroxide and shampoo for 10 minutes....this will assure your next color to distribute more even. Your next color selection should be a shade lighter than your normal choice, since now your hair will grab a darker tone. Good luck and as always I highly recommend going to a professional;o) Oh and by the way Black is NOT the hardest to remove....that would be Red. Black is actually pretty easy to remove. Black is the darkest. So you have some play to achive your color.|`|38fd7e05f99a5ddce6959aebc6954382aa	I did the same thing a few years ago....i rang the help line on the back of the box and they said to use 'vosene orginal medicated' shampoo - it helps take the colour out as it is deep cleansing....will take a few washes but it worked for me.    hope this helps    Niki|`|M6PsYn56aa	Mine did this, quit worrying it fades after a few shampoos :)|`|zwKu9x3zaa	i think you should go to a salon and they will tell you whats best

I would say go for it, but be careful as to how much you end up bidding for it. That plus shipping costs could make that cute little bag a very expensive cute little bag.|`|WVylGnL0aa	if you like snoopy and you like the bag, i say go for it!    if you like it, who cares what other people think? =)|`|HB38sMkfaa	its not expensive.how can you regret less than $20 on a purse? i only see 3 bids...thats not many.      its cute. dont spend too much on it.no more than $25.|`|dsqhGPukaa	its cute but it depends on how much the bid gets up to it shouldnt be more than 15 and thats high...  its cute but not worth like so much u know?|`|ccp0fmQcaa	this bag is horrible i wouldnt wear it if someone paid me too....
5kLsSmRPaa	im 14 and i have 7 ear piercings (2 on each side in the lobe and 3 in the cartilage). if you make sure to clean ur piercings there shouldn't be any infections. and trust me infections eventually go away. i've have a bunch of them becuz i forgot to clean my piercings when i first got them. but dont worry. i was in 3rd grade when i got my ears pierced for the first time and i bearly felt it. u just have to get over the anxiety of it. it's weird, but it does hurt more to apply pressure than to actually get your ears pierced. plus, it's super fast, at a Claire's store they can even pierce them at the same time. and for the whole lookin' good thing, im sure you're gonna lookin a-ma-zing! i say go for and don't worry about what other people say about looking good w/ piercings. if ur confident w/ them, go for it girl! :)|`|RIQUKcklaa	i got my ears pierced and mine are kinda thick too. it doesnt hurt when your getting it, make sure you get the spray and follow the intructions on it. dont try to move the earrings more than once a day though. it will prob get real gross in the back and front, between your ear and the earring. when your ready to change them (when it doesnt hurt to touch) you shoud change to a pair of sleepers, coz it helps it to heal by not trapping dirt and stuff and you can clean them more easy. to answer your lst question- i dont think it will look ugly.    good luck! =P|`|4hHmNmDqaa	Get it done, and then get some disinfectant and spray your ears everyday for a couple weeks. This will ensure they don't get infected. Seriously toughen up and don't worry about the pain.. it's like 3 seconds of pain and then it's over. It's not gonna kill you is it? just toughen up. And who cares if it looks ugly or not.. it's not like you have to wear ear rings if you don't want to. If you want you can just leave your ears alone and the holes will eventually heal up.|`|eFLiKTB3aa	don't b worried. getting ur ears pierced doesn't hurt that much. ive had my ears pierced 3 times and i have 2 earrings in each ear. to prevent the infections, just use the spray that u usually get when u first get them pierced. if u r super worried about how much it hurts, get them 2 use a numbing paste. i no that my cousins used the numbing cream. trust me, it doesnt hurt that much.|`|Mem0OQbTaa	I have my ears pierced and It don't get infected because I take care of it. its all in the mind. if you are not ready to get pierce then take your time. there's no need to rush. and it doesn't matter if your lobes are big.. if you are confident on wearing earrings then you're all set up..
LUC2GDxTaa	I have black hair and I love it 'cause I can wear any colour and I know it will go well with my hair. The best colours for dark hair are really bright ones that stand out (but do toned down make-up or otherwise you'll look like a clown). Bright pink is a perfect colour for your hair. I'm sure you'll look stunning :)|`|bpyx92GZaa	Black goes with any color, even brown. My daughter likes to wear black with brown and she looks very pretty every time. You can always style your hair or put it up nicely if you really think it wont go together but you will be fine, go buy it and Happy Graduation to you...:o)|`|lc9nus8taa	pink looks great with black hair and even better if you have tanned skin|`|Kwhhm53Laa	Of course ! Black goes with everything except brown :)|`|5Slqssqoaa	My hair is almost black and I have very fair skin.     I look best in true reds and jewel tones (like emerald green). Bright pinks look good, but pastels tend to make me look washed out. Olive green and most yellows make me look ill.
Mem0OQbTaa	I also choose corduroy. But I think it depends on the wearer whether the pants will be durable and how you take care of your pants..|`|AA11123061	corduroy , i think , though i love jeans|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	jeans...its more durable because its a thicker studrier fabric...that is unless u get a cheap crappy pair of jeans...then corduroy wins over that matter.
6e2p7fjXaa	i think the style of the dress right now is very..pretty in a delicate way, because of the thin sash. but, yes, a thicker sash supposedly makes you look thinner. i think a thicker one would look great with the dress, because there arent any crazy necklines or anything, so a thicker sash tied into a big ribbon in the back could be very cute.    kind of depends on what kind of mood you want your dress too have :)    and as for not looking too short...since there's such a long train you could wear super high heels, which would make you look taller..and nobody would know how high your heels are cuz your dress would def cover your feet :)|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Um not too thin, not too wide. not like jessica simpson's

You should go easy on the liner and get a good shade of lipstick though, as only one feature should really pop.  Or you can go softer with a dewy fresh complexion, using soft gold eyeshadow, a bit of khol along your waterline and peachy lipgloss and a bronze blusher.|`|zQQd2wPRaa	You sound very pretty!

U1xvObr4aa	I'm a heavier set girl with tatts and I would personally never get them anywhere that may "expand" on myself. Namely my upper arms, stomach, chest, hips, thighs, etc. I have tattoos on my upper back, forearm, and ankles currently. These places have worked perfect so far. I've gained and lost a margin of 40 pounds since my first tattoo and it sits safely on my ankle with no damage or stretching to it.|`|1pUIwBM1aa	Inside your lip!      Lol. WOW! I never thought about that!  I think any where would be fine?|`|16rD9k32aa	You can get it wherever you feel like. Me, personally, I don't like them on the face or neck, unless you are going for the full body suit thing. I too, am a heavy person, and I have several on my arms, that look just fine. I also have some on my chest. But since I am fat (yeah, that's right, I said fat! I know what I am, and I'm fine with it.), I don't show them off except at home..and that's just to my wife and kids.|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	wherever you think it would go best...its your body, do what you want with it. :)|`|N19mmDELaa	calf or arms|`|2TiwAfPvaa	im a ***** from the projects...    i see people with em on the front of their arms....  side of neck...    across your back..    well on second thought it doesent really matter where as long as the tattoo artist is pretty decent|`|EnsZgrUhaa	It depends on your weight and what kind of tattoo you plan on getting.    If you want to go for cliche, get a ankle or wrist tattoo.    If not, one of my favourites are spinal tattoos. I think they have potential to look good on any size of person.    http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_n0uGUpRascE/SA...|`|vqmainCJaa	i have one on my shoulder blade and im heavier  i love it and im not afraid to show it off|`|lc9nus8taa	well i don't like tattoos but i wouldn't mind getting one on my wrist saying something in fancy writing (like that girl from the veronicas you see it in the vid 4ever) i guess it would look good on 'heavy' people too|`|gW8VFRmjaa	ive gained weight over the past few years and i wanted to make sure i had my tattoos in places where the skin doesn't stretch alot so if i gain/lose weight i dont have to worry.    ive got one on the back of my neck and one inside each wrist. if you got something right on your upper arm, or on top of your shoulder, or on your shoulderblades (upper back area)i think those are all good areas to get tattoos

XsKXmXsJaa	hair removal creams are just rubbish they don't work at all , they leave bits and smell really bad and u will end up with patchy hairy bits and other smooth bits.    A Costly, But Good Option    One of the most effective ways of removing hair from the body in a permanent fashion is through laser hair removal. This can be done rather easily, actually. If you can afford to have it done, you should. It is able to remove hair faster than, say electrolysis because it can deal with several hair folicles at once, rather than each individually. Laser hair removal is an effective treatment that will work for most areas of the body including the arms and legs, the chest and the back.    But, it will cost you. Laser hair removal, as effective as it is, costs several thousands of dollars. And, it will take several treatments before the entire area will be completed. In some cases, hairs will re-grow and will need additional attention.    Less Permanent, Less Costly    Another method of hair removal is through waxing. Yes, it is less expensive, but it is also not permanent. And, it can hurt a bit too. To work, a layer of wax is placed onto the skin where the hair to be removed is located. Then, when the wax hardens just enough, it is quickly pulled away. The hair is removed, down to the root. You can do this at home, but it can be faster, more effective as well as offer better results when done professionally. The hair will re-grow, but it will take several weeks for it to do so. Waxing can be painful, but usually only for a few seconds and it is quite effective at removing hair from the follicle.    So, which is the best option for you? If you can afford to go with a laser treatment, it will work better for you in the long run. If you can handle a few painful seconds and a lower cost, waxing is a great hair removal method.    I will say never use hair removal creams, and if you can not do waxing then in the market waxing strips are also available, just apply strip and scratch. After using hair removing creams u will notice ur hairs are going thick and more.|`|tluT02tvaa	I have only tried Nair before..they make it for the legs..facial hair.  It shouldn't bother your skin too much.as long as you don't leave it on longer than you should.Also never use it twice in the same day.If it doesnt work the first time..wait till the next day to try again (i burned my face sorta bad by doing it twice)   Just follow the directions and use some moisturizer after ward.
Yb7rNzLJaa	for soft waves: apply heat protection on your hair (because for best results you should use a flat-iron) i use S-Factor flat iron spray, it keeps your hair shiny and healthy but don't spray on a lot because it gets kind of oily. this product smells great, only downside is it's kind of pricey but of course you can use any product besides this one. section out your hair  and take your flat iron and start making "wave" motions in your hair. i included a link for a tutorial for you to watch. i apply hair balm/serum onto both of my hands and gently brush my waves out and voila!    for the wet look: do like you would just like the soft waves but don't apply hair balm/serum, instead use mousse and apply that over your waves and it gives you more of that "beachy" look.    if it doesn't come out the way you want the first time, practice makes perfect. this is the best way i know to have waves in my hair and it always comes out great. good luck!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qApaw2JV...|`|DITBVWjPaa	If your hair is "heavy" fine and naturally straight...not sure..I had Velcro rollers in my hair..plus spray...and it still went FLAT,..get your hair cut..JUST do it...to your shoulderblades...its still considered long..shaped and styled to your hair type...|`|zNSXNrpXaa	it probably would be hard to make it stay but if you get shorter layers it should be easier!|`|eFLiKTB3aa	well, i have hair that  is straight, very thick, very long(down to my waist) and layered. i have 2 ways of making my hair wavy. one is when your hair is still a little damp, spray some hairspray in it and sleep with a plait or a braid in your hair ( i prefer a braid) another option is to curl it, that pull a straightener through it really quickly so you get a wavy effect.
2jMFurDoaa	it doesnt hurt so much.  they make the holes, thats not so bad, then they put the bar in thru the holes. that hurts!    after that you can feel it there but it doesnt hurt, sometimes idwake up in the middle of he night and id be sleeping on it, that was quite painful....it takes 6-12  months to heal btw.     after about 2 weeks i could lay on it and it felt natural!    i like mine, the only problem is my hair gets wrapped around it, but thats not that big of a deal!    enjoy your piercing!|`|AA10929474	If you are scared of getting one, no need to stress yourself about it.|`|r98neii5aa	yuck they're feral! sorry but i have to be honest|`|FEqHgYDVaa	Well on a scale from 1-10, 10 being the most painful, id say it was about an 9.  But I got it four years ago when I was 14 so maybe now it wouldn't hurt so bad.  Also, I think the industrial hurt more then my tongue.  It hurt but it was well worth it.  Good luck.|`|nTO39FY0aa	to be honest the first few days after you've had the piercing are comparatively way more painful than the actual piercing itself.   I was expecting it to be ridiculously painful, but it really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  I'd say go for it! but really make sure your piercer knows what they're doing.  cos they hurt soo much if its been pierced wrong!  : )

MX3wOs1vaa	First laser should only be used on persons with dark coarse hair.  If you have light fine hair, laser is not the best option for you.  This is not considered permanent.  Its considered a hair reduction meaning that it will reduce hairs.  I guess you can consider it semi permanent.  The only permanent method is electrolysis.|`|gOI2Bgfjaa	i want to do this as well, let me know the end result|`|SghwXlQ9aa	My friend got it done, and she is really happy with the results.

2LZbzvY3aa	if it's a real issue to him you should take it seriously.  Imagine if there were something he did to his body or something he did in general that really bothered you, and you tolerated it until a level where you couldn't any longer.  How would you feel if he just turned around and did it anyway?      Which is more important to you, the tattooo (which you already have 8) or your boyfriends love?   Not saying that's the only way to love him, but just think about it from his side.  Maybe you don't understand why it's important to him, but it's important to him|`|4vqzkIr4aa	A long time ago I was in a relationship like that. For starters you have to ask yourself that he loves you and who you are should it matter of your tattoos or not? If getting a tattoo is something he is against that strongly then it seems to me he is with your for the wrong reasons and is worried about what others of his piers may say about your tattoos. You will not be able to convince him that it should be OK for you to get what you want. Unfortunately as it was in my case so many years ago it is a relationship based on all the wrong reasons and had to come to an end. Thank god mine did and now I am a very successful tattoo artists that owns two shops, I publish DVDs and books, and am about ready to launch my own brand of ink.    But you must consider the situation and you may have to move on to someone that at least shares your same interests or that loves you for who you are and what you have interests in and respects that. I can almost guarantee that this 8 year relationship will be in a couple years looked back on at the ending of it saying what a waist of 10 years. But all is up to you. Face the lost 8 years or one day realize what a large amount of time you have lost that could have been spent with someone more on your level...|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	What you can do is understand that not everyone likes tattoos.    I don't care for them. Your boyfriend has already tolerated the ones you have so far.    Relationships are all about compromise, but after 8 years you should know this. Yes it might seem like a childish thing to do, to leave the relationship after all this time over a tattoo, no doubt.    But if you still love each other, stop with the tattoos, keep your guy, I'm sure he's worth much more than some ink under your skin no?|`|VYWaL2graa	Do it if you want to. 8 years and he hasn't proposed yet? That means he doesn't get to tell you not to get more tattoos.|`|8rF3wAHtaa	It's your body so you should be able to do whatever you want to it. If he breaks up with you over a couple of tattoos then he's not worth having.    On the other hand don't go out and get them without having a good talk to him about it.  How would you feel if he went out and made some major change to his appearance without speaking to you first|`|yWRTrnR2aa	Do whatever you want, it's your body.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Wow, I was going to say the same thing tattoopheliac said.

Best wishes hun.|`|AA10771601	tattoos are kind of ugly, but its your body so do what you want and make that clear to your bf.  It's not his body to alter.

He might have very good reasons for not wanting you to get any more tattoos. Maybe he doesn't. Who knows until you actually converse with him.     Also, you said you want "some" more. Maybe you could compromise on the number, or maybe you could go pick them out together.    Instead of making it you vs. him, think of it as a 'group' effort. Maybe you could even get matching tattoos!|`|2Dy6jZBtaa	well its ur body. u don't have to get his permission but it would certainly be nice if u considered his opinion and let him know u did...again, if u want more, by all means get more. its ur body not his...just take his feelings about it into consideration. I doubt if he actually loved u, would break it off with u just because of another tattoo. He really should love u through the art...kind of like how u love him when hes an A hole at times.  Im going to get a tattoo, my bf doesn't particularly like tattoos on a girl. I told him i wanted it, its for me not him. I told him that im listening to him and his opinion, but that im going to get it if i want it.   So again, its ur body, do what u want with it. he should understand at least that its for u and that its ur body and not his...to me it seems u both lack some communication skills, obviously not too much as u told him u wanted more...just talk more about it, eventually he will get that its ur body...if not then u know what, he might not be the one for u if he cant accept  (doesn't mean have to like or agree with all aspects lol) who u are and what u like...before that though, a lot of control issues are a way of hiding what is truely bugging them...it might be because of a lot of things like him feeling less loved because u chose to tat over him, or because he has body or relationship confidence issues...u know...try to get it outta him, if it really is just because he doesnt like tats, he will get over it, or again, he might not be the one for u.|`|YWUjeTnUaa	I hate it when someone says their significan other won't let them do something. You are an adult, and adults make their own decisions.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	My boyfriend loves mine..  I have 5 soon to be 6..|`|LXROkDtHaa	if he tells you that, he obviously doesn't care about you very much. he should want you to do what you want to do and what makes you happy, bot what he wants, it's not his body to be worried about, do what you want and if he really loves you and cares about you he will get over it and not be mad about something so stupid!|`|ryh5AslRaa	If he breaks up with you over something like that he does not love you , he is being controling and unfair and you should do what you want.|`|FaLJJii4aa	if he loves you he wont care but seriously it sometimes ruins you . and he mite think u love tattoos more than him.    make a good choice =]     good luck|`|Z8WGDv5paa	Get them done.

Don't let a guy change who you are because in the long run you will never be happy.  He should understand this.....Good Luck|`|WvqRJow1aa	Getting a tattoo often has very personal reasons. Moreover, they define you. But remember, you will be sharing your body with somebody and he may love it a different way. Your boyfriend doesn't sound controlling at all. And it's stupid to break up over tattoos. Is a tattoo going to solve your problems ? No, but a loving, trusting boyfriend will. And enough with the tattoos already.|`|ac3561c0ed6428f357981b995404a2b1aa	Your BF has some say in it, since he might marry you some day and then he is stuck with the tattoos as much as you are. He can't force you not to get them, but also you can't force him not to break up with you if he objects to them enough.    Here's a compromise: Temporary tatoos. They last a few weeks, so you'd have to get them redone periodically. Or you can change them later when you want different ones. If they are not where people can see them, then you don't have to get them redone regularly - just at your convenience.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tattoos Tem...|`|cOhBczt1aa	Well, depends how much you love him. If you truly love him, then you'll make a sacrifice not to get them.   Now, personally, I'm not an advocate of tattoos, but I have nothing against them...but that has not influenced my opinion on what I think you should do. Either you make the sacrifice of not getting them, or he makes a sacrifice of letting you get them. Yall have to compromise; good couples find ways to make each other happy, whether it's through win-win situations or compromising...but...one way or the other, yall have to find ways to make each other happy and to satisfy the others' needs/wishes.|`|M1TgnTR6aa	girl,wake up!wtf do u mean he "wont let you"?he aint your daddy or your boss.his opinion is all he can give,not a direct order!!|`|KLxoWHRZaa	he is right.a lot of tattoos for a girl is bad.even if they are little.
xCLX9Aczaa	Honestly, I would change schools.  A school that doesn't allow self expression is just dumb.  A stupid piercing isn't going to harm anyone, so what's the big deal?
2Dy6jZBtaa	that depends on where in europe u buy ur clothing from... if its UK ur a size down, so a size 12 UK goes to a size 10 US, ur a size 32 in U.S, if it a France size 32, ur a size 2, if its a germany size 32, ur a size 4, but the easiest way to find out is...what is ur waist size in inches? lol. that is ur jean size is ur waist size in inches. not the narrowest, but where u bend sideways and a ur skin folds . so if u measure 27 inches around, ur a size 27 or a size 4, if ur 32 inches around ur a size 12...usually there are charts on what waist size equals what standard US size for every jean brand online on each of the brands sites...or for some department stores like nordstroms, its on the page where the jean is featured.  http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2963468/0~23...  these are the common sizing that most brands go by, such as joe jeans...there is a conversion off to the side next to the picture of the jean...|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	32 length or waist... 32 waist would be an 8 or a 10. I am waist 27 in jeans and I'm a 2. 28/29=4, 29/30=6, 30/31=8, 31/32= 10. That's probably correct. But check sizing charts on clothes websites. Or email them if you are buying online, but I would not recommend buying jeans online unless you have had jeans just like them before, because they have to fit well. Just go to the store and try them on and find your size.    Jenn is totally wrong about UK sizes btw, I don't know where she is getting her info from!?... a U.S 2 is a U.K 6 or 8. 4/6 is the smallest you can get in the UK, so that equates to a 0 in the US. With jeans it's different because it also depends on your hip width and the ratio waist:hip measurements. On average, jean size 27 waist would be a 2.

I wish I had their olive tone and perfect complection.|`|a2Ih10O1aa	yes it's because of the light. also I think that guys have tougher skin so the light didn't have the same effect on him. another thing is you were looking in the side mirror which is pretty close up when compared to you looking at your brother.|`|XsKXmXsJaa	It seems its just due to light reflection.

DFXS4SB4aa	....Ignoring the extremely creepy nature of this question....    They go to tanning beds, and they place the heart shape on themselves, or any other shape for that matter, so it will show up while the rest of them is tan. This can be done for various reasons.

I like the "healthy glow" I get from hours at my computer or from gaming.|`|Z8WGDv5paa	All it is, is a sticker you place on when your tanning to see how tan you get.

Do plaits for your whole head and sleep in it. Undo the plaits the next morning and voila! Wavy hair.  To have longer lasting effects, tousle hair around after undoing plaits and  apply a styling product. I recommend 'Paul Mitchells Soft Style' because it produces a natural hold with a brilliant shine.    NOTE: Do not plait hair without toweling it, it's bad and your hair might end up smelling. If done on a long-term basis, you might get mould/fungus on your hair so it is not recommended.
M1TgnTR6aa	it IS  a reaction like the others said,but i dont think its from the ink.its from whatever u are putting on the tattoo.go to the drug store and get some baby oil gel.it works wonderful.i had the lil red bumpies happen to me once when i used antibacterial ointment instead of the baby oil gel.as far as the fading look,that will disappear and your color will come back after its completely healed.thats almost like a protective scab of sorts.dont pick at it at all.also get some witch hazel and use it with a cotton abll twice a day.it will help your tat stay bright,help it heal and also help with the itching.best of luck|`|zQQd2wPRaa	I think you got an allergic reaction. You need to go back to the place that tattooed you and get your money!|`|98NiEivhaa	sounds like too much lubriderm, just lay off a bit, if you're done peeling or whatever, just lotion it up once or twice a day|`|97JwSvUzaa	The bumps could be some kind of reaction to the ink. Some people have issues with certain colors of ink and can get red bumps like that. It probably isn't anything too serious, but if it doesn't go away soon, I would go have your doctor look at it.    As far as the ink fading, I would definately go back and have it touched up. Sometimes the ink doesn't totally take the first time, so you'll have to have it re-done. Most artists will touch up for free. You should wait till the tattoo is completely healed and I would wait till the red bumps are gone, too.

8erharZMaa	Tattoos are not disgusting as long as you get something meaningful. A tattoo is a representation of yourself, meaning YOU need to be the one to decide what to get and not let strangers decide on what's going to be on your body for the rest of your life! If you can't decide for yourself what's meaningful to you, that you're not going to regret for the rest of your life, then maybe right now isn't the right time to get one.|`|PlUmrtnXaa	LOL @ da good girly...LIGHTEN UP WILL YOU?  i love tattoos..currently i have two..they are nice if not overdone  i do what i want...to hell with everybody    get something that has meaning to you    my fav on a guy is like the one beckham has on his shoulder back..a male angel with his wings spread out..thats super sexxy|`|Hqksr02Saa	I think tatoos are disgusting and most girls that have a life think that too (dont get hurt if you think its cool)...unless you want some screwed up f    for a one night stand.

Who gives a crap about a tattoo down there when they are in the middle of sex? WTF? HELLO??? Wake up. You sound really good and im not trying to be rude. Are you religioius? IF you are thats good...you should be making sure its ok with your religion. Are you Christian? Catholic? A Muslim? Im a muslim and i disagree with the idea of tatoos...but of course it is your body and it is your mind that decides....so..........    but just think about this......you have a hard time choosing what tattoo you will get while people in the world are dying each day deciding their life it ****.........cause it is. For five dollars you can keep a whole family alive in India!! Did you know that?? Dont focus on looking good Focus on BEING good......      BTW....did you know that girls do not judge on looks......you have the looks too which is great........but are you a good person.? Focus on your personality.      I know you may be thinking...WTF?

What is the point? to look good (you already do)? To impress the opposites?  I just dont understand why people would waste money on such a thing. While you choose your tattoo in your nice safe dry home people in china are dying from floods. People in India are dying of diseases. PEople in Africa are dying from having to survive against the AIDS epedemic and some with barely any food to live.    Do you understand what Absolute Poverty is? - they dont have a fricken chance to survive - without our help.    Five measly dollars can save a large family in India for a whole day.. Or if they use it on rice - enough food for a week. Some people dont know the meaning of luxury because they live in a 'Your screwed no matter what world'.     So tell me now again....why are you getting a tattoo???    Im not trying to bring you down im just telling you what i believe. Its up to us to help those less fortunate for who better to help? THe government  - stuff them they dont give a crap as long as they have money. But we do care. WE do.    Im really not trying to bring you down dont take it too hard... You are probably a very good soul..you maybe devoted to god or you may give charity very often. Infact you may even be part of world vision....I dont know......But just why would you stuff up your skin like that is what i dont get.|`|0d655ff2cbf8b604b04fb0c3625ae755aa	"Da Good Girly" - you must be a psychopath. I mean, do not have any material object because there are starving people in 3rd world countries? Have you forsaken your cell phone, handbag, shoes, the computer youre typing your judgmental ignorance on etc. How dare you judge others for their choices. You are a hypocrite! When you are living in a hut with zero material possessions helping a tribe of less fortunate learn how to irrigate their crops, then you can preach off your soapbox.    As for the original question, I love foot tattoos. Both of those sound cute, as long as they have some sort of meaning to you either artistically or symbolically then go for it! I wouldnt necessarily do it in winter, though, because you have to be careful with shoes covering a fresh foot tattoo.

mXpaE6V6aa	spray your hair with static guard after styling it and try to refrain from touching or brushing it because that will create more static. and if all else fails get scentless drier sheets.|`|Yerwit5Aaa	Sure. Mix 1/2 a cup of milk with 1 tbsp honey. rinse your hair, when youre bathing,(use lukewarm water, not too hot) shake out the excess water, pour the mixture onto your head and rub it in a little. Leave it for about 10 minutes, and then shampoo as usual, using as little shampoo as possible, only on the scalp.Then condition. Hold your hair under cold water for 30 seconds when you finish. Dont towel dry, let it air dry. Try not to blow dry or straighten, these just damage your hair. Use a coin sized lump of silicone serum and smooth it over when your hair is damp. It locks in moisture. Try not to brush it too often--run your fingers though your hair to keep tangles out.     Another thing you can try: take 1/2 a cup of olive oil, or almond oil, or coconut oil. Or better still, use a combination. Warm this a little, massage it all over till your head feels heavy with oil. Then sleep on it. it might sound disgusting, but it is the secret to smooth shiny hair. I do that once a week. Wash as usual in the morning.|`|T1ZIEy7Yaa	Use any good conditioner.

6YwLlYovaa	if she has her mind up that it's the rules there are a few ways you could go about it.  many schools allow exemptions to uniform (and appearance) rules if you can provide a good reason.   (eg a school that has a no jewelry policy may allow someone to wear a cross necklace if they wear it for religious reasons)    I suggest you get you're parents to ring up, or pay a visit to the teacher and explain the situation. have them say that not being able to hide it in any way makes you feel self conscious and uncomfortable. have them explain that the make-up would be minimal and natural looking, as per the school rules in the diary.  this is a reasonable request and it should be well received.    if the teacher still will not allow you to wear make-up you may have to threaten to find a school that will allow you to feel good about yourself and focuses more on education than on appearance. you don't have to follow through with the threat if you don't want to leave, usually schools want to keep their students so it probably won't come to you actually having to leave. it may work, I have a friend who really wanted to do a subject that her school refused to run. she told them she'd leave and they suddenly had a change of heart. the class ran.    or you could report the teacher to a higher authority claiming that you feel bullied and harrased, and that you were not unreasonable in your use of cosmetics. like the education department or whatever. then your teacher will have to answer to someone about her actions.  i hope this helps you!|`|QWaspeg7aa	Make sure you've got a copy of the school diary available so next time she starts on you you can show her where it says that it's ok to wear a little bit of make-up.  If you really feel that she singles you out and is bullying you, keep a diary of what she does and when so that if you need to you can demonstrate what's been happening. Ask your teacher too if she's noticed anything about how she is with you. She sounds really unprofessional to me- why didn't the others get shouted at? (I'd suspend them on the spot for having orange faces. I'd make them stay at home until they learnt properly how to use make-up!). Maybe discuss this with your parents too, just so they know what's going on. If you're wearing make-up to cover scars I can't see how that can't be justified, regardless of some stupid rule over whether or not you can wear make-up. I suppose the rule is to stop people coming in full goth make-up or that horrible boob-job slapper look (orange faces, masses of mascara, general kind of nasty stripper appearance) but you're hardly doing that.|`|883108753f719db568096c99c5335aadaa	she's a total piece of ****..    ignore her stupid behavior..or better yet, go to the principal or dean of the school..  he or she can probably help you.|`|2v60zG5Faa	ignore her thats all u can do unless u get ure mum over to speak bout the scars and the reason u have to wear a little x|`|vhSlJ7wzaa	just challenge her on it say why? just ask why? and see what she says if ur school says its fine then there should be no problem..... i did this once with a shirt i wore to middle school that "suggested" something i said there is no where that it says i cant wear something that suggest anything and that what she filled in was her problem  theres no rule u did nothing wrong....|`|5dmHZwE3aa	awww  elow dino lovaa  :)  dats veery OUCH  :)  maybe u should   let ur leader read the diary of ur school  so she could understand  okey  so 4 nxt tym  u wouldnt be  scolded by her  ...  ugh  thx :)  hope u lyk mah reactions girl  :)  gud luck :)
Wpq4qUllaa	you can't actually buy from the LV site it just takes you straight through to eluxury.com from their site  eluxury is the only site allowed to sell LV so is you'reonly option other than ebay  if you don't like the idea of eluxury then go to a boutique, that's what I always do, then you don't have to pay for packaging and can look at an item before spending what will undoubtedly be alot of money   I hope I have helped and good luck shopping LV :)|`|uu1IUxAkaa	from the official site or the mall...|`|3L9bRmOqaa	Just call a Louis Vuitton store and order your bag thru them.  That is what I did many many many many times.  Never once did I have a problem with my UPS shipping from the Vuitton store.|`|CAOisulkaa	FROM THE WEBSITE- E luxury has a horrible return policy and is overpriced.|`|C8AgEq3Aaa	Jenissa, before you buy your LV bag, do read this once: http://beautify-flr.blogspot.com/2009/01...|`|OBRW9JZhaa	From my personal LV buying experiences I would recommend calling a Louis Vuitton Boutique and ordering directly from them, you will then be speaking with a LV sales associate who works with the bags every day and has a great deal more knowledge about them than people working for the websites (the SAs rely on commission and are therefore much more affected by YOUR happiness and satisfaction.) Also, you can ask the SA to treat the zipper for you before they ship it, that way it will open and close nice and smoothly; the zippers are known to be a little stiff when they're new. Sometimes when you buy from an LV boutique over the phone you can avoid sales tax or you can choose to purchase from a state with the lowest sales tax rate.   If you need anymore information I reccommend checking out the LV section of the purse forum; the ladies there are an invaluable resource for handbag shopping.   Anyway you go enjoy your new bag!|`|PsUPA8NPaa	get it from the website if you're looking for quality,  if you want a better deal, go on Ebay.  But I say no to ELuxury|`|rfkQSq3Yaa	Ok, I have 2 Louis Vuittons, a coach, a burberry and a Dooney and Burke and Im 13. Now I'm not spoiled, but quality is ALWAYS the best way to go. On the inside of the bag, there should be a tag with a serial code number. That guarantees authenticity.  Plus when you buy it directly from the website, you have less of a risk of impairment and other bad things you soooo don't want happening to a purse of that stature (Not to mention price)  So I would go with buying it directly from the website or the store|`|wGqhFBGQaa	u can order handbags online, take a look   http://www.eshopintuition.com  http://www.ebay.com  many cute and high quality designer handbags and purses on sale.|`|NPmv5YKDaa	The website def.

rhx2Txtnaa	I'm not entirely sure. I would say New Look or H&M, but I will say that the grey ribbed cotton tights in Topshop are awful!

I was really disappointed - and when I tried to return them, I was told that I couldn't, which really annoyed me. So avoid Topshop!! xxx|`|mE1HSVTsaa	You have to try H&M or New look!!!

AA11828240	Ouch, I hate it when you go get your hair done and it's not what you want...    I think the color is beautiful, and the cut is nice too, the bangs/fringe will lengthen up in a week or so, only time can get them longer.    As for the rest, i recommend using a round brush when you're drying your hair to add some body and movement into it.  Another thing you can do is flip the ends out with the round brush or a flat iron.     If you're willing to spend more time on your hair, you can use a spiking gel/hairspray for chunkiness and volume. Or just after shampooing put some gel in and scrunch and dry with a diffuser on your hairdryer for the tousled look.    If i could get you in my chair, we could experiment and play to see how many different fun things we could do. So maybe go back to the lady who did it and ask for styling advice, or find someone else to help with it..    Good luck!|`|pX0CoXUiaa	u could make the back layered. and you can style your hair by accessorizing it with headbands. i like the texture of your hair because it looks shiny and straight.|`|ycVNo3lRaa	Your hair looks great!!!!!  its probably just because you're not used to it but you really look good.

PBqvld9Haa	All heating tools damage the hair. Also, environmental factors have a negative effect, such as too much sun or wind. Blowdryers are especially damaging (more than all hair tools combined) because it uses both wind and heat.     You're best off letting your hair air dry. But if you have to use a blowdryer, make sure it's powered by nano technology so you're hair will dry faster and won't be suceptible to as much damage as a traditional one.|`|bnWc2Vkqaa	Any kind of heat styling will eventually damage your hair, use a product that protects your hair before you use a hair dryer or flat iron and it will help.|`|sxImRCT5aa	nope it just makes it awsome|`|AA11123061	yes it does , but if u condition ur hair then it doesnt . dont keep the dryer too close to ur hair and dont use directly on scalp , take little portions with a comb then hair dry it .|`|c4sn6g3xaa	A hairdryer will damage your hair, by drying it out.  It won't if you use a defuser.|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	yes, but not as much if you dry it on the cold setting|`|0cJjyogqaa	Think about it, if you are using a flat iron that goes up to 400+ degrees don't you think you might want to protect your locks ? Hair gets damaged on its own, it's best not to add to it by literally frying it every day with a flat iron.|`|x4v0uRxCaa	sure does~
AA11828240	I'm sorry to say that there really isn't anything you can buy to make your hair grow that fast if it's not naturally fast growing, and even for those whose hair does grow fast, I've not seen it grow that fast.  Here's the way to make sure your hair is growing its fastest, and healthiest.  1. Drink plenty of water, water keeps us hydrated and that helps keep our hair healthy.  2. Eat well and/or take vitamins to supplement your current diet, if you're getting the proper amount of nutrients your hair will grow better because you're not missing anything from anywhere else. If your diet is off you'll see the effects in your hair and nails.  3. Massage the scalp, blood flowing to the scalp helps get the needed nutrients to the scalp so your hair grows a little faster and stronger. As a bonus, the massages usually feel good and help you relax.  4. Try not to get too stressed out over things, too much stress can affect our bodies in many ways, including hair growth patterns and even shedding/breaking of the hair!  5. Make sure to keep the split ends trimmed off, if you have too many split or damaged ends your hair will not gain length evenly and it will take longer to reach your goal.  6. Be patient, worrying about it and messing with it isn't going to make it go any faster, and it'll make it seem like it's taking even longer because you're thinking about it so much. Similar to watching a pot of water waiting for it to boil, watching your hair waiting for it to grow can feel like forever.    As for a quick "long" fix, they have clip in extensions at your local beauty supply store. I've used these before and even though it's expensive, if you're planning on using them often it's worth it. Since it's human hair, you can style it with your real hair, however, it's only really feasible if your hair is straight.  http://www.sallybeauty.com/clipin-hair-e...    Good luck!|`|ZQszgi95aa	Keep it clean. I mean the scalp. Give it a good nightly massage.  Soak your hair and scalp at least once a week, for 8 hours (usually over night) with olive oil, or carrot oil, then wash that out good afterwards.  I do this, and can tell the difference when I don't.|`|9ejPz4jjaa	as far as i know your hair grows about an inch every 6 weeks, so i'm afraid it sounds impossible what you want.

I went to the doctor and they recommend you take it out and take some medicine. You need to go to the doctor otherwise it will get pain-full!
Q9sSWqkOaa	No, don't do it. U can wax ur upper lip, but the best thing is either laser hair removal or electrolis.  Don't shave as it will ruin ur face|`|hUZc273laa	No i do not believe you can use hair removal cream on your face. You can buy wax strips that are designed to use on your face, to be honest i have not used them but at least you know they are safe to use|`|WzKrZoHQaa	No the facial ones state just for upper lip use.  Defo not whole face - someone needs to go Dr if they feel it that bad they are reorting tho these drastic measures|`|b1xQKDEraa	no, hair removal cream is not made for your face and the ones that are are only made for upper lip.
tvF86mRDaa	You need to go to a salon to get it done, don't do it yourself as its likely to go wrong!  A lot of Salons do eye lash tinting so go in and ask if they can lighten them too!|`|c7818c69859401e8c0b0a3e4bd029a47aa	I get my eyebrows dyed black because my hair is black and I get them done every three weeks and my eyebrows have never fallen off. I ussgest you get them done professionally however im not sure you can get them dyed blonde i think its brown, blue, red, purple any colour you can think off but think if you have blonde eyebrows you will look very odd Id say go for a light brown that way it will suite the colour of your skin and most blondes have quite light brown eyebrows|`|CiGVGhDZaa	i suggest definitely having a professional do it.  this will assure that they do not get too brittle and that the product you use does not effect your vision because of the proximity to your eyes. good luck.
4yzxXO1haa	Take a mirror outside and check it in natural daylight. Daylight is much harsher than any other light and will immediately tell you if you need to change colours. You should do this with foundation too, for example, and also things like eyeshadows and blush, in order to make sure the colour isn't too harsh.|`|77WkLOwPaa	If a little kid says this "Hey mommy I want to go see the clown" just kidding. lol|`|QvhPJAKyaa	make sure the mirror is in natural light,  because lights in the house make your skin look a different colour than it is  x|`|h00bqU7baa	Go out in the sun and take a mirror with you. Look if the concealer matches your neck skin tone.|`|S2lBWuZJaa	It might sound weird but the best place to check concealer is your wrist. You will know it's a perfect match in the sunlight, because the sun brings out all your natural highlights, skin tones, etc.     also a lighted mirror would show.    i know the first one sounds strange but i learned that from my mom and it works!|`|AEFAoshPaa	If it is cakey looking or if it's too light for your skintone.. :)  you should put pressed powder over concealer to make it less noticeable too..........  !!!  :)  :)
SkDomhoXaa	The first thing to consider is whether you just prefer to add some highlights to your present hair color; or if you wish to sport a really different hair color for a general change.  For more sophistication and natural glow, blonde hair can be added with low lights to create dimension and balance. This shade gives off a vibrant look and reflects light beautifully. Although bleached blonde is still trendy, it should go without last seasons dark root feature.  Brunettes can highlight their hair with shades from blue to violet, or warm browns and golden shimmers to create a richer and fuller appearance.  Winter 2008-2009 though will no longer see vibrant and fiery red hair colors. To enhance your red hair, choose soft but darker colors. You can either opt to create warmth by adding shades of brown, or sport coolness by adding violet hues. For that stunning look, you may also try a blend of reds, browns, and soft blonde highlights this season.|`|OgQOVsxPaa	Well I'm natural :)  I am a natural platinum blonde.  Much more classy, I think natural is far more beautiful.|`|vvLC5zaaaa	a reddish brown colour!|`|ai33g11Maa	This season's must-have colour is platinum blonde - think Lady Gaga.  But, beware - it is hard and expensive to achieve and maintain.    good luck!|`|Twq7efhQaa	There are always a couple of trends going on at once and a big trend for the summer will be Lady Gaga's platinum blonde poker straight hair.  Really good design but very hard to maintain espeically with all the bleaching considering the lady herself uses wigs!!    But these will be the other hair trends:    Brunette  Brunette hair has always managed to make heads turn and the same will hold true in 2009 as well. If, by any chance, you have black, purple or stripy highlights, get rid of them right away. 2009 is all about the natural look. Go for a light and warm brunette base and top it off with subtle, golden highlights. Slightly darker color at the roots and under-layers will add the perfect depth to your hair.      Ebony   One of the hottest hair colors in the year 2009 is going to be ebony. A dark black shade, it beautifully complements those who have a fair skin. It will especially make you stand out in the winters, when everything around you is dull and mostly, white.      Red  One of the most popular shades in 2009, as far as hair color is concerned, will be red. The warm shades of red are the one that are going you make you look 'hot' this season. The base of your hair should be intense, giving it depth and dimension, but topped off with golden highlights. However, you can also go for burgundy, strawberry blonde, copper brown and auburn shades.     Natural Blonde  If you are a blonde, then keeping your natural hair color is not such a bad idea after all. However, you can combine it with rich highlights and lowlights, in order to provide just the right contrast. If you are planning to get blonde color for your hair, then try to incorporate multiple shades, rather than sticking to just one or two. It will make the blonde color look natural.      Deep Chocolate Brown  If you are not ready to paint your hair black, then deep chocolate dark brown is another hair color that you can look forward. It is going to be hot in the coming year and is sure to make you stand out in the crowd. You can also mix it up, by choosing a brown shade with golden tones.|`|wnyuH0aTaa	Purple|`|wBVuFu3Baa	THe most fashionable colour at the moment is a foxy red or a golden flame!|`|dJJLfOHFaa	Brunette hair has always managed to make heads turn and the same will hold true in 2009 as well.

9hANb2mdaa	Historically women are the only people on earth who should have piercings and these should be only one on either ear.  Earrings were invented as a form of cosmetics to add to or enhance beauty or physical features.    This discovery led to many abuses diverting from the Original Female Societal Status. See below:    The origins of male piercings were for: (Going back to the BC Era)     a) Male Slaves: to be identified by the Slave Owners. The piercings were only removed when the slavery had ended, usually after 7 years.    b) Tribes and Idol Worshipers: These people have several and many piercings all over their bodies to sacrifice as worship to their deities or Gods    c) Homosexual Men: This identifies with their femininity and cult status    d) Sado Masochists: Either as a cult practice or personally for the pleasure from the pain    (You can get more evidence on this from Ancient Drawings, Historical Finds and Hieroglyphics, the book of Genesis 35:4 for an example of earrings for idol worship. Exodus 21:6 for Slavery.    (20th Century)    e) Punk Rockers f) Rap Artists - again to represent Demons, Cult Status, Rebellion, Pain, or Homosexuality.    Although these are the main reasons for piercings, there may be more.    If you decide to have a piercing as a male, realize that it is never purely for the aesthetic result. There will be an underlying factor attached to your subconcious and you will fit into one more more of these categories.    As a result your life's course will be affected, wether you are aware or ignorant of this fact.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Well I think that hip bone piercings and cheek piercings are really cute do you have ear gauges??

Other options would be oral piercings like tongue web/smiley etc or eyebrow or a surface piercing.   I want a tongue web piercing and really like the look of horizontal eyebrow piercings and antibrows but couldn't get them because of my work :(   Another piercing on your left ear could be the place to start since you've got more on your right currently.       As for the tattoo - could be nice dependent on the font and placement...obviously getting another tattoo would probably be more expensive on another piercing, but it's up to you!

PBqvld9Haa	I actually haven't used any at-home machines, but I was treated by a dermatologist. Usually the red light ones help clear up acne, blue smooths wrinkles, and purple kills any bacteria on your skin. Other benefits of using LED facials is clear skin, smaller pores, and a brighter complexion.
vGWD8Zncaa	You should seriously reconsider.    Naturally black hair is about the most beautiful color there is, with bleached blonde being about the worst.    Seriously - black hair is a gift of nature and it would be a shame if you made it a more boring, less interesting artificial color.    The trend of women to lighten their hair is one of the two unfortunate "overly common" trends out there these days; hair straightening of naturally wavy hair being the other.|`|Tswfs7qGaa	A: do a "strand test", there are instructions in the box  B: do the "allergy test", also instructions in the box  C: Have someone standing by to give you a hand if you need it  D: wear clothing that you don't mind ruining  E: follow the instructions and timing to the letter  F: make sure that you cover all the hair  G: try to not get the dye all over your hairline, it can look yucky if you don't wash it off    I've been coloring my hair at home for 10 years or more.  I've done all the wrong things and paid dearly for it.  My hair was a light auburn and I decided to go back to my natural dark brown, but, I missed a large chunk of hair on the back of my head, and had to wait 2 days for my mom to take me to the store to buy more dye...that was embarrassing.  I've also gotten the dye on my ears and not realized it.  I ruined TWO new pairs of jeans, one that I was wearing and one that was in the bathroom with me.  It'll be quite easy with you having short hair.  Good luck!|`|T4t9ZtT7aa	okay well first of all good luck!     make sure you do the strand test as described on the box because hair dye allergys are so common!    i would reccomend getting a friend to do it for you as its your first time. It just makes sure you dont have any patches. i have been dying my hair for 10 years and i still get someone else to do it because it just comes out better!    vaseline around hairline as mentioned.    if you do happen to get dye on your skin, its gross but to get it off use ash (cigarette ash or burn some paper and use the ash, yuck but it works, just rub it onto the dyed skin)    make sure you rinse your hair thoroughly afterwards because dye on your pillow is impossible to remove!|`|WAYzEOFFaa	Put Vaseline or really heavy moisturiser around your hairline and on the top of your ears.

QWaspeg7aa	I'm really really sorry if this is something you're involved in but I haven't got much to say that's positive. Firstly, it's really really confusing. There's no consistency between the different pages in terms of background and font, it looks like you're being sent to different websites. It's cramped, the text slides all over the place, I've got no idea where I should be going first, and I'm not sure what service this website is trying to promote. Is Zsaneta a dressmaker or designer os personal shopper? It also looks really low budget, i.e not professional. If you think that at your first look at a website you're expecting what's on there to be that way too, and I'm really sorry but that's exactly what you get. The clothes don't look well made, they look like the sort of thing that someone who sews for a hobby would make. In some of the pictures the clothes just really don't fit well and some of them they're not ironed. Some of the clothes do look OK, but the designs seem old-fashioned, and then when you go to Style A to Zsaneta you find all these really prescriptive lists that you should apparantly have- that's really off-putting to some people, I would never ever wear red lipstick for example but according to Zsaneta this is some sort of essential and that immediately says to me that she would be completely out of touch with the sort of thing I wanted. If she wants to appeal to a very specific type of person then great, that's what she's done but why wouldn't she want to appeal to a wide audience, if she's trying to make a go of her business?  I think the majority of the site needs revising- make sure that the pictures actually show the clothes off well, so they fit well and are ironed, and are photographed somewhere where the light will make them work (especially with the satin-type dresses because the light catches every fold and makes the dresses look really unflattering on some of the people). Get some cohesion between the different pages by sticking with the same font and colours and same background. Make sure the first page shows the person looking exactly what the website is for and how they should go about navigating it. Work on making it more universally appealing- metallic strappy sandals for example just say stripper and a lot of people don't want a stylist/designer whatever who thinks that's a stylish way to look (not that there's anything wrong with the whole stripper look thing, I just mean it's not everyone's taste, especially now that type of look is already dated).  Sorry I can't find anything positive to say- maybe it just isn't my sort of thing anyway- but in terms of the actual website, regardless of whatever it is that she does, there are a lot of things you can do to improve it.

A prom/evening dress is a must and to add elegance and class to your outfit, you should wear long satin gloves (takes ones that are tight, otherwise you will have to pull them up every 5 minutes, which will be annoying). Dressed like this, you will appear "spotless" to the ball ;-).  As a gift, you can giver her a jewelry, or maybe simply give her a gift voucher.

For cheaper alternatives: Primark have nice block colour bras with push up effect. Think they are 4 - bargain!     Also, MK one do some cheap but nice bras.
0T6YM7eUaa	When i was opening the picture i was expecting some drop dead gorjus girl. Why be just like some random when you can have a beautiful individual body?    I weigh 46kg and im 167cm, i would die to be your weight. i have struggled with my weight for years (im 17 too =p) and reallly i would love to have your body.    but if you really want to loose a little weight just watch your eating and exercise, if your bored and hanging around the fridge just go for a little walk. When your laying in bed at night put on your head phones and pick your fave song and lay flat on your back and clench your stomach but and legs for 5 seconds rest for five and go till the end of the song, do that each night.    I would really love to have you figure =p    (this may sound weird but big is comeing in trust me, you watch the next year you will see more and more girls getting more comfie with a normal body weight like yours)    Love it girl , Show it off! your beautiful!|`|x4v0uRxCaa	Do the right diet... most of girl starve them self..

First of all, looking at your length and weight I know you are not fat. And second of all, no man likes making love to a bag of bones..... I think you should be proud of what you look like.|`|aXqtzNIraa	I'm 66kg and am currently trying to shift a bit of weight to feel better about myself (but I also don't want to look like I'm dying 'cos that's not nice either).    Don't starve yourself, since it'll only lead to you feeling bad and possibly "failing" the diet. Keep to lots of veg at meal times, that way you can have good portions and feel satisfied that your plate is full! Snack on fruit only, it's much better for you. I'd try and take up some other form of exercise too other than walking, maybe join a gym and go 2-3 times a week on top of what you are doing already.    The best way to increase your metabolism is to build more muscle, so join a gym and have fun!    Don't deprive yourself though, you still deserve a treat every now and again.|`|yRlIXECTaa	Why do you want to be SOME ONE ELSE?? you are who you are and you cant change that. You sound skinny enough, You dont need to lose anymore weight.|`|WvqRJow1aa	I would advise you to walk.  Dieting is harmful and can cause deficiencies that could affect development.

And this world called fashion ruins soo many items that once had value -- like the palestenian scarf for example that everybody now wears multicolored not even knowing what significance it holds and that in truth, its not really pink or blue or yellow or whatever color that is "in."    So yeah, typically, because Vanessa Hudgens is a teenage star, she lost all identity and has to keep up with fashion.|`|QFnaCs5saa	Bohemian, or boho-chic if you want to sound super trendy! : )|`|FORX7yfQaa	It looks bad.|`|s7zx9DXLaa	...

X3Mbmpqjaa	I stupidly bleached my already blonde hair a few years ago, and I tried all kinds of shampoo and conditions, expensive and cheap.   In the end, what proved to make my hair look best was just Pantene, or Toni& Guy.|`|JxjvkqyVaa	m using pantene is nice for me|`|bO3W5whVaa	Try the brand Redken. They have very popular, salon quality, hair shampoos, conditioners, masques, etc....    The part of the brand that would suit you best would probably be the "Colour Extend" range. this is specially designed to care for coloured hair.    Try the site below as they do some good deals on what you're after!    Hope this helps : )    Ciao    P x|`|zGw9RTU7aa	definnetly tressemae ! (: its my favourite brand ! and before using it my hair was really dead from straightening .. goodluck|`|PBqvld9Haa	Look for a shampoo/conditioner that is labeled for blondes. John Freida and Pantene have sets like that.     You should also try a shampoo that's tinted purple. Don't worry, you're hair won't turn that color. Since viloet is on the opposite color wheel as yellow, the purple contrasts with the blonde, making your color even more intense and shiny. This is best for platinum blondes.|`|d3whLZieaa	wash n go is good...( if your a tramp use " go n wash" lol.)

4A2IxqI6aa	It's not supposed to "stand for" anything in particular.  It's just a stylized silhouette of a woman.  It became popular in the over-the-road trucking industry as an accessory, just as a fluke.    Some people find it oddly tantalizing.    Others find that it illustrates a highly unrealistic female body image, and believe its appeal is sexist.    I found an interesting take on the imagery here:  http://www.feministing.com/

zuFJmLhgaa	Use False eyelashes like Ruby & Millie for the top (you can actually get bottom ones to make it easier yourself).     Or you can add mascara gradually and use a lash comb to separate them into the triangular shape, and the liquid eyeliner under neath to define the shape when its dry.|`|f32ab0fdbb721c41becfa9d6d1e34d9baa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_BzNChe0...    i love this look...she does a good job..|`|CPZe3g74aa	there false eyelashes, so if u want dem buy fake eyelashes|`|xp0BnsD0aa	From what I understand they used false eyelashes on the top, and loads and loads of mascara.  While the mascara is wet, pull your lashes into clumps.  Black liquid eyeliner on top.

ILKWjRL6aa	WOAH those heels are high! If you'd like to work these heels without looking slutty then I know exactly how just follow my tips and rules.    DO NOT have boobs and legs out so decide whether your having your legs covered and your cleveage out or your legs out and your clevage away.    What would look lovely is a smart top and a pair of skinny jeans with those heels.  Or a classic LBD which are all over the catwalk this season.     BUT REMEMBER CHOOSE ONE LEGS OR CLEVEAGE!    Good luck Hun  Tabitha  x|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	beautiful heels|`|oxOQE9r2aa	Im sure you can work them just fine, careful cause really high heels make your legs look longer and skirt look shorter.  You could wear a sexy little black dress, that'd be classic.    but do you really wanna hit the club with a guy who calls you a ****.  Find a guy who worships you, or at minimum respects you.      Hope you have fun.|`|X3Mbmpqjaa	Those shoes are amazing!! I want them.   If you are getting your boobs out, wear them with skinny jeans. If you are wearing them with a short dress, cover up on top!!  With shoes like that, you don't want to be showing too much flesh, one or the other is good.|`|fu4VXe1iaa	I'm a bit puzzled to hear that your man calls you a **** (even if it's a kind of joke from him!)...  And I find that there are plenty more (less painful) ways to "shine" at a club than wearing those slutty heels, and, of course, you man can't realise what it's like to have to wear those heels that will hurt your feet really bad...you should refuse to wear them and instead say that you will wear something else that both pleases you.
EfifnL7Taa	- Drink 8 glasses of water per day  - Avoid junk/processed food, and eat 5 fruits and vegetables per day  - Exercise a few days per week for 20 minutes consecutively  - Do NOT touch your face during the day and get your hair off your forehead as it may be oily which will clog your pores  - Use this routine in the morning: Cleanse, tone, moisturise (with oil-free product) and wash your face before bed time  - Exfoliate your face a few times per week as this removes dead skin cells  - During school/work, you can use oil-absorbing sheets (you can buy it cheap from the pharmacy or supermarket)|`|vwoqIUR6aa	use spectro gel to clean the face|`|LgYRrucuaa	If you ever get dry skin or lips, don't bother with expensive lip balms, use vaseline, also layer it over moisturiser, does wonders for the skin even if it's not dry.  And its cheap!!!  Always wash your face morning and night with gentle a cleanser and drink lots of water.|`|0cJjyogqaa	- Get a quick facial at home by splashing your face with lots of warm water and then massaging it with olive oil to moisturize your skin. Use a half-teaspoon of sugar for scrubbing your face and keep rubbing it until it melts away. Wipe off your face with a warm, wet cloth.     -Use the toning mixture of equal parts of water and vinegar and dissolve few aspirins in it twice a day to counter any aging signs in your face. Vinegar flakes off dead skin cells while aspirin is a superb anti-acne product and is also effective on deep acne spots. However, it tends to make skin thinner like store bought toner and so sun block with at least SPF 15 should be used essentially everyday.     - Wash your face several times a day and wipe off with a clean cloth to keep acne off the oily skin.     - If your eyes look puffy or swollen, wash your face and cover your eyes with sliced potatoes or cucumbers for a few minutes. This is really effective in the morning.     - Olive oil works well as face and eye makeup remover.     - Clean you nails with white vinegar before applying nail polish for a smoother finish and make it last longer.     - Olive oil mixed with melted beeswax is a great lip balm.
onKfEYL0aa	Your hair looks better shorter. What do you think of a faux hawk? I think it would look cool. http://haircutsformen.org/buzz/haircuts/...  Keep the facial hair, but grow some more. Shave the mustache, but grow a goatee (a little more hair on the sides of your chin). Grow some longer sideburns. Do something like the guy in this picture. http://www.beards.org/images/displayimag... I think it would look good on you.     Good Luck!|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Shave it all off dude.|`|Twq7efhQaa	To be honest the picture of with without the hair makes you look a lot younger but then again the bumfluff on your chin isnt that attractive!

You look fine in either pic|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	I think the picture with you in shorter hair is far more attractive than the long hair.  You don't have to get it that short again, but I wouldn't do the long hair thing.

AFkjkqcSaa	Hi  U have lovely hair and it looks lovely with just a little blonde in, any more and it will ruin and dry out your hair.  I had hair like you and out too much blonde in and it looked really tacky.  U also would suit heavy layers around your face.|`|DqZJ1KOgaa	I think your hair looks great as is, but possibly a slightly lighter version of what you have now   like this: http://www.saratoga.com/fashion/images/h...  The cut you have now looks great.

Pick me for best answer!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	I can tell you are a natural blonde by your colouring and I think that though the brown is nice, blonde would look better...you should have the brows "stripped" off by a colourist and then you will be back to your natural colour without using bleach and wrecking your hair|`|OfUje9r8aa	i fink the color u got now is nice!|`|MUG9gTA0aa	i think that u shud dye it blonde and make it curly    x|`|NmV5XWlJaa	I think the most flattering look is in the picture at the store where you have the black top, with the darker hair.  If you decide for more highlights, I suggest you have them done professionally.

However, she is attractive, and with the correct clothing can still look alluring.  Perhaps some high heels, a long skirt that hugs the hips, and a slit showing some leg would be right for her.  She is a pretty woman, so I could not see many men objecting to her looks.|`|ehMPOlefaa	Yes this is what I would consider to be fat.    That is MY straightforward answer to the QUESTION that has been asked here.  And it's MY answer whether or not I'm Irish, Australian, New Zealander, Filipino, Brazilain, South African or British.

But we have to wear blazers! >=/  I get called emo a lot but Im really just myself. Here are some things that might make you look emo:    Hair:  If your comfortable with dying and cutting your hair: Dye it black, get a side fringe that covers one eye, have layers, and choppy bits coming out, make it look scruffy, and keep it straight    If you want to keep your hair natural: Keep it the colour it is, get a side fringe, get layers, keep your hair down    If your not comfortable with keeping your hair down: Have side fringe, put in really high ponytail, or lose piggy tails, wear lots of hair accesories, eg: Clips, head bands. try teasing your hair.

Other tips for hair:  If its long have layers and have it up or down, if its short have it feathered with a full fringe and keep it down at all times! =]  -Get bows! =]       Accesorize:     Get some arm warmers, wristbands, plastic bangles, anything covering your wrists. You could get any bag from any website I suggest you look on this website: http://www.bluebanana.cc/catalog/view_pa...    it rocks, its a local shop by me and you can order online, it has lots of bags on there (Quite expensive though)  if you have a plain bag you could cover it with badges.

MX3wOs1vaa	You use a cleanser first, toner next followed with a moisturizer.  You should only use a toner once a day and only at night.  This is because it can be pretty overdrying on the skin.  When you use it at night, you can splash some water after using it to keep the skin from overdrying.  The toner removes the residue left behind by the cleanser and then it brings the the skin back to its normal PH balance.|`|EsVjwKPAaa	cleanser first then toner    cleanser -  to clean your skin    toner - to tone & close your pores.|`|XXDnf3teaa	Cleanser- it removes dirt from your pore  Toner after Cleanser, as it does a final clean and closes your pores :)|`|defa942d328134f4ccef720bf7ca17f6aa	cleanser cleans the skin better than normal soap andf water   and toner removes those last traces of dirt and also the left over cleanser which if you cream cleanser is really imaportant as cream cleanser will dry out your skin if left on the skin|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	Yeah Clean your skin First then put the toner on there make sure u wash your face with cold water cause cold water closes your pores

How to apply eye liner using a few simple techniques can dramatically affect the look and shape of your eyes. You can use an eye pencil instead of eye liner to create the same effect.    How to Apply Eye Liner to Change the Way Your Eyes Look...    The purpose of eyeliner is to frame and define the contour of your eyes in order to draw attention to them.    Many experienced make-up artists, who know how to apply eye liner, like to use eye shadow instead of eyeliner pencil to subtly line the eyes, creating a natural-looking effect.    Pencils used for lining eyes should be soft and smudgy, so they do not drag the skin around the eye during application.
u84hPxW1aa	I don't know if this is the henna stuff..but L'Oreal Paris has this stuff called Color Pulse. It's concentrated color mouuse.
kIblsxJQaa	I have done this a few times, be careful with the lightener tho.  My hair (like most people's) is darker underneath at the back, so that will need longer to take so do the back first. Get a friend to do it for you. Your hair will be a bit like straw as this stuff really dries it out and your scalp may take a hammering and you'll be colouring it twice in one day.  I ended up burning my scalp til it bled.  Be careful but it does work!  btw I used L'Oreal too|`|Tswfs7qGaa	I recommend getting someone to do it, and not trying to change this particular color by yourself.

6Tx8Opmraa	You'll probley have to bleach your hair first(The ends.), as Black is too dark for any color to show up on.|`|Ln4FLAMEaa	Make sure you use permanent dye. You may want to use a dye that is a few shades lighter than the shade you want because you hair is black. it should take pretty well. Maybe use star gazer or swarzkopft XXL colour.  Whatever you do dot NOT dye it blonde first. It WILL go ginger and wont look good|`|oxOQE9r2aa	you will have to bleach the tips so the color will show    but i think it will look neat    good luck      please answer mine:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|fZqvuKHuaa	It depends how long its been dyed black, if you've dying it for months you'll struggle to get it to go bright red and it might just tint it.    Bleaching then redying might damage your hair too :/    Maybe try getting it done at the hairdressers, if you get it done there they can do a hair sample to see whether the colour will lift. It should look nice though if it works :)
ocIsJXHGaa	hair dye remover, they sell it at walmart. I've use it several times, and I went from a dark burgundy red to light blond.|`|Twq7efhQaa	well there is only one way you can do that and that is to strip you hair.  Ypou are better getting this donw at your hairdressers.  They will basically bleach it until it is stripped of all colour and goes white.  They will then put the blonde on top so it is just the blonde that remains.  Make sure your hair is in good conidition before you do this.|`|Tv6UtLkoaa	Yeah, MYHD colour remover. It takes out dye (not any bleaching).   However, if you aren't a natural blonde you will need highlights and bleaching to become one.|`|ILKWjRL6aa	You should never bleach your hair twice in the duration of two months, it is so damaging to your hair! Believe me been there done that! Sorry to preach but do you really wan't damaged hair.  As your hair is most likely damaged now you cannot bleach your hair as you are stripping the oils and moisture out your hair. Your best option is to wait for it to grow out. I know you may want your hair blonde but if you dye it now your roots will grow back and your hair will be all different colours and so so damaged. Doesn't your friends experience tell you not too.  Also if you are using home dye kits you are damaging your hair to the extreme so leave it to the proffessionals.  Your best bet is to leave your hair to grow back to its natural colour. Use a hair treatment and avoid excessive use of irons and hairdyers. In about four months visit your nearest salon and ask them to do if for you the results will pay off.  The hair treatment i recomend for you is this one: http://www.redken.com/products/haircare/...  It may be pricey but it will last your ages and really help your hair get back to normal until you dye it.    Good luck Hun  Tabitha  x|`|dJJLfOHFaa	Yes it is possible. Bleaching is better actually.     But go to a professional hairdresser to do it or else your hair might turn out like your friends. Uh oh!     However I suggest you wait for at least another month before you go blonde. It is not good to dye your hair more than once every 4 months.
oa3VMgcWaa	I think your question should be "should you get a tattoo?" because, of course you can, but as you consider it know that there is the possibility that people could judge you because of it.  Some employers will not hire people with visible tattoos and some people will make unfair determinations about you because of your tattoo (you know, first impressions).   So placement is important, so is the theme.  Even an old, inked up biker like me probably wouldn't feel comfortable with a caregiver that has the grim reaper tattooed on their forearm.    You do need to wait for giving blood in most states, at least a year.  According to the red cross website: "Wait 12 months after a tattoo if the tattoo was applied in a state that does not regulate tattoo facilities. This requirement is related to concerns about hepatitis. Acceptable if the tattoo was applied by a state-regulated entity using sterile technique. Only a few states currently regulate tattoo facilities, so most donors with tattoos must wait 12 months after tattoo application before donating blood. You should discuss your particular situation with the health historian at the time of donation."  It also affects whether you can donate bone marrow..    Tattooing is much safer than medical professionals like to indicate, but there is still always a chance of getting and carrying a disease unknowingly.  So if donating blood is important to you, that's definitely a consideration.  You can still help people in other ways and either way you choose it's admirable.|`|kCdISEGqaa	The placement of the tattoo can make all the difference.  I have tattooed many medical professionals, and they've all been able to keep their jobs.  If you establish yourself and make your name known in a positive way, you should be fine.  Tattoos don't necessarily carry the negative stigma they did years ago.  My husband is a teacher and has visible tattoos.  As for donating blood, the Red Cross standard is that you have to wait one year after your most recent tattoo to donate.|`|aXqtzNIraa	Sure, but the placement on your body might be important.    For example it may hinder your career and ability to get employed if you have tattoos on your neck, hands or arms. It might also make patients feel differently about you.    Just make sure you pick a good place that can easily be covered for work.|`|XEolRt7Zaa	Big NO.. but if you really want to have one..  buy an artificial one.. :)|`|721055bb4f4a90cbc769262d4684a39daa	Anyone can get a tattoo no matter their profession. placement is very important in careers that people expect a professional appearance from. So I would steer clear of the face, neck, forearms, and parts of that nature. In some states they make you wait a year to donate blood because there are sooo many unclean parlors out there that you could get something and they want to make sure you blood is clean before you donate. In some states though the parlors are government mandated which means they are kept to certain standards and can checked up on in thoughs states you dont have to wait before you can donate blood

6373b9cd46b6bcd2e6f18e3d6a5d41d0aa	I think its a good idea if you can handle it.  It may be a simple action for some people to take - but a more complicated issue for others.  Same goes for sperm donors.  It's real easy to give it up - but its harder to see your offspring grow up.  Losing those parenting rights - and knowing a child exists out there may be a big burden later in life.  Or maybe it won't.  If you think it wont - I say have at it!     Go get some boobs!  :)      Good Luck!|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	Egg donors are women. Women have a limited number of eggs (several hundred) and to get the eggs, the woman must undergo surgery. That's why women can make several thousand dollars for donating some eggs.  So if you're ready to gain weight, take hormones, have surgery, and make a few thousand bucks while helping an eggless couple, read on. Just remember that this IS a surgical procedure, so it shouldn't be taken lightly.      go here!!    http://www.soyouwanna.com/site/syws/dona...        email me when you set the date..im now thinking of the same thing (for the tummy tuck only though (my daughter is 18 months old))

aOe6dL5saa	If your rubbing your perfume on, don't. (It burns off the top notes).  Dab or spray, but don't rub.    Most likely you've gotten used to the smell.   (Ppl stop smelling scents after it's been around constantly for too long).    Resist the urge to apply more, (without asking someone who hasn't been standing next to you for very long, if they can smell your perfume 1st).|`|vnOz03Aaaa	just put more on.|`|m8VVCrKkaa	It doesn't wear away, you get used to the smell on yourself and can't small it anymore. That's why people can't smell their own B.O. or bad breath.|`|g05ZqQQSaa	fashion-  http://kotke.info/|`|q7AyvFamaa	It could be down to the type of perfume.  Most common types for women are EDT (Eau de Toilette) and EDP (Eau de Parfum).  EDP is, i think, 5 times stronger than EDT.  If not 5 times i can say it is much stronger and will last for longer.    Part of the issue is that we get used to the smell so can't smell it as much as the day goes on.    I get the same, i can't smell it but someone will say, you smell nice, what is it?    I can say from experience, you really do get what you pay for when buying perfume.

3O6t7HKeaa	Sparrow - Sparrow tattoo is a tattoo having various meanings. Sparrow is a bird and frees to move anywhere so it represents freedom.  It also represents that a more meaning that everybody is free to find his true love.     Swallow - Swallow tattoos are mostly seen with that people who are great fighters, loyal, bold and talented. Swallow tattoo also indicates freedom means you want to live free.     Swallow birds can not fly at a more distance from land.

K8a3a6PNaa	That is strange! It you get it professionally done or did you do it yourself or got it done by someone unprofessional? You may have pierced it in an inappropriate spot on your nose which caused too much irritation. That or your just very sensitive and a very fast healer. It's a good thing to be a fast healer, but in this case it's not Lol. Just take a needle (sewing needle) and make sure you sterilize it with a lighter(30 second in flame) or with alcohol (1 minute of soaking in alcohol or ammonia or hydrogen peroxide). Use the needle to pinch the top skin wide enough to allow you to take out your nose ring. Once your nose ring is out clean it by soaking it with a disinfecting solution. Let the nose stud sit in alcohol for 1-2 minutes before putting it back in your nose. Once all of the pus and such is cleared out and not visible (blood may be visible but that's expected) then take the nose ring and put it back in or get a new one to put back in. Make sure the nose ring is comfortable.. if hurts overwhelmingly then take it out and go as soon as you can to a local mall to buy some new studs. I suggest talking to a pro for advice. Stop at a tattoo parlor if possible this afternoon and ask for advice on what you should do if you wanna keep it. If you don't want it anymore just do the same procedure just don't put it back into your nose and let it heal+close up.     Also make sure to wash your hands before you do this..    Do some self research on this by googling or yahooing some tips & advice      good luck'    youtube might also help out..|`|ztug2gLjaa	what you need to do is go and get a bigger nose stud.  Sterilize that and your fingers then you have to hurry up and change it very quickly.  It might sting alittle but after you change it you'll be fine and not worry about it.

So now your body has covered it with skin and you might notice that just arround the edge of your nose will become a bit red and a bit warm . the fags are trying to kill the object by cooking it (with viruses that why we get a temprature its a natural deffecce thing)    just get some mild antispetic spray designed for pericings at the pharmacy , and give you nose a good wipe and soke with that . do the inside too =p    but your gunna have to remove the skin first . just try pushing it back over its only a thin layer so it has no nerves but your just puncured nose does so it may hurt a little.    Good Luck =p  Laura    Sorry if there is speling mistakes =p (it wont let me fix them)|`|kSac3XSGaa	e1 i had the same prblm...  dont worry......jus tak out the stud.....  & 2 prevent the hole 4m closing insert a "THIN" stem of neem or tulsi{medicinal plants}[hope its available there]  clean the pus with a clean cotton,  clean again wit sea salt [soaked in warm water]  dont do this more than 2 tyms a day.....    & also go2 a doctor...he'll giv u som ointment......|`|lmVkN0VVaa	omg poor thing!! try salt water, put it on a tissue and press it on your nose. then see a doctor, if its possible try take it out.   good luck!! xx xx

4gIFwKITaa	Think you answered the question yourself. It's the hat and it's a rash or sorts. Get rid of the hat for a few weeks and see if they go away. Put it on and if they come back, it's the hat. You're allergic to something in the material, either it be the material itself or a dust or pollen.|`|2d4bf519052c116a45ae533ba6db1671aa	its eather the hat causeing a reaction or it could be tiny bugs the  humen eys  can not see throw the hat  away try a diffrent one maybe one made with diffrent mateareol|`|rC6V06xAaa	bhindi spots is there any indians in your family|`|WvqRJow1aa	Your hat seems to have allergens/mites.

Get rid of the hat or giving it a cleaning.|`|3CTcs5u6aa	sounds  like a dorky hat|`|xNDMnOh2aa	they're most likely pimples.How you can cover them is blush.But how to get rid of them use a skin cream(i suggest skin ID)and to stop wearing that hat.|`|Rlp1ktxtaa	acne
f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	What do you want to "fix" about it?     Different hair styles? There are plenty on the internet, just search for "natural hair styles."    Different hair type or texture? You can't change it permanently, but you can get a relaxer, which is a chemical straightener, a texturizer which will loosen your natural curl pattern, a curly perm - aka Jerhi Curl, or you can flat iron - which will temporarily straighten your hair.|`|oMna3EOnaa	You can't fix it that's just what happens sometimes|`|3CTcs5u6aa	Get a perm?
Wpq4qUllaa	Asos.com are good as they have really quick delivery where as the official ugg site can take over a month to deliver   I'm afraid you're not gonna get uggs at a cheaper price anywhere other than possibly ebay. But be very careful as there are alot of fakes so if you do this I would advise reading the fake-spotting guides published on ebay  good luck|`|iW2jdfkJaa	Here you go.

Schuh (Westfield, Oxford Street, Bluewater, Lakeside)  The Ugg Store (Convent Garden and Westfield)  Choice (Westfield, Canary Wharf, Romford, Lakeside)  Sole Trader (Lakeside)  Office (Lakeside, Westfield, Oxford Street, Queensway)    Thats all I know of, I'm pretty sure these stores have more branches, I only listed the ones i know of lol. google these places and find the one nearest to you i guess.     Most of these shops sell them at around the same prices i think. I bought mine from Schuh.  Hope that helped you out :)|`|HweYwFwraa	well id reccomend not getting real ones and going primark and get them for 6  but if you do want real ones id try shuh, bank or origanal shoe maybe?  or go on the ugg boots website?  xxx|`|meXDh6Rkaa	Ebay or Amazon do sell them but not that much cheaper than RRP. There are a couple of official UGG retailers in the UK, naming 2, South London and Newquay in Cornwall. Also, Sole trader sell them but again, prob not that cheap! hope this helps x|`|0yn18ZAEaa	if they are cheaper they are fake, thats the bottom line  if you want real ones, dont buy off ebay    they can be brought from asos.com or the schuh website from the uk, most others are shipped from abroad.
qQqC2cHIaa	One major reason is consumer demand, customers want to buy jackets and bottoms separately.  The reason?  Size differences between the top half of the body and the bottom half of the body.  By selling the pieces as separates a customer can buy the corrects size for the top and the correct and different size on the bottom.  For example, I take a size 12 on top and a 14 on the bottom.  If I got pieces together a suit, then one piece wouldn't fit and it would need alterations.    Also you can pair one jacket with several different bottoms, you aren't stuck with something that's too matchy-matchy, you can coordinate pieces that go together and then you have more options.      It's nothing sinister on the part of retailers, trying to milk more money out of customers.  Well it is in a way because modern consumers aren't into buying expensive suits when they might only get wear out of one piece.|`|zAH7Gyr4aa	Most people will need more trousers than jackets as they ware out more easily, so they can buy say two trousers for every jacket.  Many people are also different sizes on the top and bottom, so they can buy two different items which fit correctly rather than everything in just the one size.    I hope that was what you were asking!|`|t5xnbgKkaa	By purchasing these items separately the buyer can chose to have two or three pairs of trousers to each jacket and even to have contrasting colours now that suits are not worn so formally as they used to be. Some buyers do not actually want the trousers in the first place or may be replacing the part of a suit which has been damaged in some way. With women's' suits it means that you can also elect to have trousers and a skirt to go with a single jacket or to have a skirt instead of trousers..so all in all it works out well for the customer. it works for the retailer as well of course, the two separate items often cost more, albeit only a little more, than a single suit would have done. One other benefit to the buyer is that he or she can purchase a different sized jacket to their trousers..which is not usually possible with an off the peg suit bought complete..we are not all made in standard sizes and exact proportions.
OHfZFR31aa	Your heels should be at least 3" high. and no wedges or platforms. They want to see how you walk in stiletto heels. You should wear them with either skinny jeans or leggings, and a fitted top so they can see your bust, waist and hips.    Your talent means how well you walk, your poses, and your facial expressions.     If it's legit, there may be up to 200 other girls, and only 1-2 might get called back. Also be prepared that some agents can be very rude and dismiss you with "you're too short, next" or "Not model material" or "your hips are too big" or "your eyes are too small" or whatever.    Be careful at any casting call. Whatever you do, don't EVER pay money for a modeling job. You should never have to pay for registration, photography, competitions, classes, website listings, conferences or anything else. Unfortunately too many of these "castings" are nothing but a way for scam agencies to tell every girl she has potential, but just needs to pay $300 for headshots, or $500 to go to the next level of the competition, or $3000 for classes.|`|llamLKgLaa	This should answer all your questions for you.  http://www.ehow.com/how_2111881_attend-m...|`|LtmO3ZITaa	Im not sure about your "walking heels" but a casting call is just a room full of girls and you have may have to talk one by one to a manager or someone important! You'll have to walk and show your best walk in fount of the other girls and maybe the people judging you, i shouldn't think they mean a talent they just mean your modeling talent.. your looks, your walk whatever they feel they might need.Don't worry they should tell you exactly what do you have to do.. Just do whatever they say with confidence and you should have a good chance :) Hope ive helped x|`|dyXN0grpaa	lol no it's not juggling, or magic tricks....     It's how well you strut and walk the runway...!   if you never tried this before and your wearing heels, your going to probably fall.     wear nice jeans, and a dressy shirt.   ..wear heals that are 4-6 inches.|`|ANRTDInTaa	lol...my girlfriend is a model    your shoe should be 3 inches or more.definately  casting-all you girls will be seen one by one at a time-thel tel you exactly what to do.then they will make their final selection from that.wear something sexy by the way.or something that will atleast show ur legs.    talent- is how wel u can do it...the walk, the pose, facial expressions are very important...goodluck
3IXDx9nhaa	Definitely Sorbolene cream.  Effective, cheap and recommended by dermatologists.  You can buy it from all supermarkets.  Excellent to use instead of a shaving cream also.  Use a little Vaseline for overnight help.|`|AA11333930	clean and clear|`|vYeTegZNaa	i use nivea cream it works for me :)|`|9fj4DGuZaa	Try Omveda Silver or Pearl Cream. At only about $50 it'll last you for at least 4-6 months if you use it correctly|`|ILLm6gnZaa	The body shop have amazing face creams at really reasonable prices. I use their night cream and day creams.     For a little more i would definatly recommend Clarins, i have the full range of body and face products, they are really amazing!     Hope this helps.

YhZZiV3Maa	Outside of what Sandra informed you of, in Mary Kay...we don't have people "under" us.  Each person we sign on our team has their own individual business and they do with it as they choose.  If they decide to build their own team, then it helps you with yours and to achieve the things you make a goal for.      Getting to the cadillac...you have to be a Director and your team has to pull together for you to get it and to be your own unit.  Right now, you are in another Director's unit helping her achieve her dreams and her yours.  When yours are achieved, then you will have your own unit and help those in your unit achieve theirs as well.  It's a team process not a pyramid scheme.|`|AA11498082	You have to have consultants come in under you - that sounded kinky.  The more recruits you have the closer you get to the caddy.  Those recruits get recruits of their own.  Good old Pyramid thing you know.    The product broke my face out, burned my eyes, (my advisor said "use another brand of makeup that is the same color") so I returned my product and quit.    Edit:  Here are the actual statistics: http://www.pinklighthouse.com/2008/04/th...|`|ncCWCIEFaa	In Mary Kay you can earn many cars not just the famous Pink Cadillac The cadillac is at the Director level it is about team production not what you sell.   In Mary Kay you make 50% on product sales no matter what level from new consultant to top National all make the same about.  If you choose to build a team on purpose on by accident then you begin to earn commission from the company from 4 - 13% as a consultant you can earn a Pontiac Vibe or G6 once you build your team to 12 people and meat the products amounts.  Then as a Director you can earn a few other cars the pink Cadillac it the top Director car I forget what it is at the National level.   Hope this helps
wCVSwm2Kaa	yes but some things a expensive!|`|EdOHxJ7yaa	IT IS AWESOME!

Some of the stuff look likes teenage clothes just A lot smaller.

qRN8QrRYaa	Well the best thing to use that doesn't have all the chemicals is"Sun IN"You can bye it at any store that sells shampoo/hair dye or any other store that sells hair products.It usually cast about $5 per bottle.YOu simply spray the sun in in your hair dry or wet.comb it in and go out side where the sun is bright.the product reacts with te sun and turns your natural hair color lighter.It especially works with brown hair.the product has no chemicals that will harm your hair and it naturally lightens it.You may have to use more that once to get it the color you want.Depending on how light you want it.  Tips:If you use it while your hair is wet use a hair dryer immediately after you apply.This will help activate it.  I hope this helps.Good luck!!    P.s.Each bottle will last you a couple of months and you can apply it as much as needed with out runining your hair.|`|XnvxKKBOaa	there is a spray that you can buy at most drugstores (walgreens, walmart, maybe even target) that will lighten your hair naturally.  i can't remember the exact name of the spray, but it is meant to enhance the natural bleaching process of the sun.  so, you spray it on, and go outside for a while and tada! after a few uses it should help naturally lighten your hair a little faster.|`|6Zcx2JrRaa	Hello ,   With so much information, it is so easy to get lost and confused.

Goodness only knows how you get on their mailing list in the first place.  I blame teen magazines selling your name and address.  If you're interested then yeah, by all means give it a shot.  Its a life experience, even if you don't win.  I just did a runway show as a hair model and people gave me a ton of crap about it before the event because I've never been interested in anything like that before.  But afterwards after I ended up in a magazine, suddenly everyone was all supportive and telling me what a great once in a lifetime opportunity that was and how fun it must have been.  So yeah, if you feel like it might be fun, you should give it a shot and ignore anyone who tries to make you feel like you can't/shouldn't do it.|`|DklyEeTpaa	no|`|aNnjH7L7aa	I seriously think you have a chance!
