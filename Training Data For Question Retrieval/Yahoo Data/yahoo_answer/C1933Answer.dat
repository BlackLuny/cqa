4KjLywFyaa	You can also borrow your friend's iPod and utilize an iPod-to-iTunes transfer program to help you. Many of my friends are using iPod 2 iTunes http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-2-iT...    It is a handy program specially designed to help transfer all music/playlists/videos from iPod to iTunes in a direct way.    In this case, all songs/videos are on your iTunes library that you can syn with whenever you wish to without losing any files.    Best luck!|`|Hs19BCy9aa	i had a problem like this one that's because after you have registered to itunes and registered your ipod it only lets you download the thing from your computer and your itunes account|`|9HmtFVvyaa	you can do one of two things... the question mark next to a song means that itunes can't find the song in your music folder. if you just took the songs straight from the usb to itunes and didn't save them then that's your problem.    the other thing you could do is plug your ipod into your friend's computer, then choose to manually manage your music. then you can just drag and drop from your friends itunes straight to your ipod. no flash drive needed.
2quTUoA6aa	You could also get speakers with a docking station which will charge the iPod while you listen to it. You can find these speakers for as little as $30.00|`|AhO0Uoppaa	charge it until the battery icon on the ipod isnt moving up and down|`|Ev473XbHaa	If you use a computer charger, its going to need to be charged much longer. But if you have a charger dock, then a few hours tops, usually less than 2. What I usually do is use my ipod during the day and charge it when I sleep. But, whats the point of knowing how long to charge it? Just charge it until the lightning bolt goes to a plug sign. That means fully charged!|`|qAV9nediaa	4hours maximum charge|`|6p5IK0kcaa	not long mine charges within one hour or two.|`|MwvTRKX7aa	it depends.  Go to www.apple.com and look up your ipod.  It should tell you how long to charge it. :)    http://www.apple.com/batteries/|`|QC6pR4y6aa	till the charging symbol on ipod is green and, or has a symbol of a white plug in green. mine takes about half hour.    also, um it doesnt matta, as long as theres some green, itll last for a while.|`|yazZH4khaa	It takes mine about 4 hours to charge up if I hook it up to the computer.|`|GOvZ1wi0aa	about a hour in a half

AA12180617	SORRY!! BUT IT's BUY A NEW ONE!    Why do people think jailbreak is a good idea it results in killing the device 2 times more than it works then when it does you cant use your legitimate apps only the jailbreak ones.    Sorry if it fails it is dead and bricked and you have no warranty and you will have to buy another one, please try to tell people NOT to do this..    Cydia (and other jailbreaks) have cause more problems for people than its worth.. (I never jailbreak but buy apps like Air sharing to enable limited disk use) as the only other extra is unapproved apps and background wallpapers (which are distracting).    NEVER JAILBREAK! It causes so many problems and yet adds nearly nothing!    the 2.2 software from apple is stable and works well and lets you add hundreds of apps (many free) from the itunes App Store, many with features available in jailbroken items.    Jail breaking became redundant when the 2.0 software was released as it add almost nothing to the ipods abilities (other than the ability to browse its file structure which also makes it less secure).    Jail breaking also voids the warranty and does cause many issues form files vanishing, memory leaks and loss, rebooting and even failing to boot.    Jailbroken ipods cause so many problems (just search on here for them).  It alters the boot code so its not really an ipod at all.|`|8CYdHL6Kaa	dont listen to that guy   YOU CAN NEVER BRICK AN IPOD TOUCH FOR SURE!!!!!!!!  PUT IT IN DFU MODE AND START OVER!!!  I KNOW FOR SURE YOU CANT BRICK IT.  timing is key
2sMA3HQCaa	I was about to write that every answering machine I have owned over the years has had an "announce only" mode. I took a look at the latest ones, and you're right -- they don't! (They are also smart enough to NOT deliver the outgoing message if the incoming message memory is full, so that trick won't work on most, either.)    I don't have experience with it, but I do see that Radio Shack apparently has one with "announce only", so you might take a look. (I washed out looking at AT&T and my other former favorites.) Good luck!|`|becbbc070b924453c0b189d4a9d17b80aa	You can't leave a message if the machine is full.  So, call yourself, and fill the whole storage (say, with a song or even silence).|`|AA11988604	don't know, but I notice some businesses just say "please do not leave a message, as we are unable to retrieve them and we do not want to miss the chance to help you.  please call back during our regular business hours.
HVQFVtelaa	Well that's very little to work with, but if you need to know if they're blown, the safe way is to connect the + and - terminals of an AA battery to the terminal of each speaker. They will make a pop if still working, no sound at all if not.
RpCwfcRzaa	You need to look on the back of the console. Right above where it says 'Made In China', there are a series of dashes and dots. If you see '12,1A'  above the "IN", it's a Jasper. '14,2A' means it's a Falcon.
owkuEmWeaa	No, but they will give a 10% Discount if you give them your old ipod. Like say you have an ipod nano, and what a nanochromatic one, instead of haveing it be 150, you would get a 10% discount, making it 135.|`|oVr2FvMOaa	No they wont. But U can sell it on amazon or ebay or any selling site and probably use the money twoards a new one....So Good luck!! :D|`|R5LuKSUXaa	no|`|OiT5SJM8aa	Nope, they won't do that. Best chance would be to put it on ebay or amazon, I believe you'll get the best amount of money there for your used ipod|`|IoVwHn3Eaa	get s refurbshed one for cheap
O8qdCBzLaa	Your laptop probably has a lithium ion battery, so the charging circuit is pretty sophisticated. It knows what the charge level of the battery is and adjusts the charge cycle accordingly. Ideally, you would want to let the battery discharge prior to charging to get the optimum charge cycle from the laptop. But, it won't affect the battery life and operation much by short-cycle charging it.    Also, a lithium ion battery doesn't have a charge "memory" like the older nickel-cadnium rechargeable batteries. These would lose about 50% of their discharge time when short cycled. That is, when you didn't let them completely discharge before charging them back up, they would start staying charged for less and less time, and would go dead in about half the normal time. They would then require a few deep discharge-charge cycles to get them back to normal.
RpCwfcRzaa	You're about 80% done. I don't want to ruin anything, but there are a few more chapters after that.|`|QIlhmWwBaa	you are almost done with the game
uomYVsiLaa	Incoming call?

351c290819306de7d8413b70e24f10ebaa	A Zune 16.  It has a better screen and a much better user interface.  You will have room for many more songs and videos.|`|ZQeXKdrAaa	It depends on your personal preferences.  The iPod Touch is far more feature-packed than the Zune, however, the Zune has plenty of more basic features, such as FM radio, downloading from the marketplace via WiFi, etc.  The Zune does have one advantage over the iPod touch, though.  It has much better sound quality right out of the headphone jack.    However, for a strictly music-oriented player, your best bets are the Sony Walkman, Creative Zen and Cowon iAudio 7.    http://www.jr.com/cowon/pe/CWN_I716RD/  Not only is it cheaper than a Zune, but it's widely considered one of the best for audio quality.  If audio quality is your first priority, then this is for you.  >40 hours of audio playback, superior quality, support for a ton of audio formats including FLAC.  You can't go wrong with the iAudio 7.|`|UTdDqT4maa	i would say the 8 gb ipod touch is definitely better. I have the ipod classic 160 gb which holds up to 30,000.|`|30832b7a62b49fee648c73068e6d1f3daa	I believe 8 GB iPod Touch is the better choice. It can do much more than Zune. Watch youtube videos, download apps such as facebook, pandora, from app store, and definitely connecting to internet when there is wireless network available. iPod Touch is basically a mini computer at the palm of your hand. The only downside that I can think of is the size. Hope this helps.|`|3cfbeb08a69370d83ff1058f52253cc4aa	Depends:    i would get an ipod touch because of all the extra things it comes with like the internet browser and the touchscreens nice but if you have a massive amount of music or you plan on getting tons of music then go with the zune,    If it was me id get the touch because 8 gigs is still a lot of music plus videos.|`|6jbZAPyzaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T92qi9cx7...  IPOD RULES|`|8ToXyspBaa	Definitely get the zune.  I have a 30 gig zune right now.  It's cheaper than iPods and I just like them better in general.  Plus, they still look really cool.  I also can't stand using itunes.|`|8TZajIj9aa	I had the ipod nano 2nd generation pink. then this saturday i got the ipod touch 8 gb. ITS THE BEST IPOD EVER. deff get it. You can go on the enternet, play games. go on aim, myspace, save photos, music, you go go on the itunes store right on your ipod and its all free! u can do everything a computer can go on the ipod touch. DEFF get it you wont regret it.

2sMA3HQCaa	You are right, a speaker-to-microphone recording  will add noise and decrease the intelligibility of the copy.    What you need is a patch cable appropriate for connecting directly between the playback machine and the recording machine. The exact one will depend on mechanically matching the connectors used on the respective recorders. If the playback machine has a "line" or even a headphone output, the other end should be connected to either a "line" or "auxiliary" input (not microphone!) on the recording machine. (If the playback machine is "mono" and the recording machine is stereo, you may also need a "Y-adapter" to distribute the signal to both channels for better reproduction.) While they don't always get it right, taking both machines to Radio Shack and pointing out what you want to do may get you the right cable.    If your phone recorder does not have ANY output connector (and some don't!), you may have to locate and play back on a recorder that does. (If it is a standard cassette or micro-cassette, hopefully that won't prove too difficult.) Preserve and protect the originals so that any accusations of editing the content of the copies can be disproven if need be.
imaeeL9Naa	It varies depending upon the user.  For the most part a user is banned because of playing a copied game while connected to live.  If you do decided to modify your console be well aware that you and your console may become banned.    ~ Shoe|`|RpCwfcRzaa	Very common. There are certain checks that Live sends to your console and your console is supposed to respond in a certain way. If it doesn't, they know it's been tampered with and your account and console will be banned.|`|mezX9Ao0aa	actually, its the games that  usually cause the detection, so ur modded 360 should be ok unless ur games r burned. but im not saying it wont happen.|`|AnhkbF2Taa	an modded xbox that goes ONLINE can be EASILY tracked...so its a 97.675% chance

Worst thing that can happen is it is someone (or company) you don't want to talk to...Pretend you're a friend and say "so-and-so isn't here right now, can I take a message?" or tell that person "Please place this number on your do-not-call list."

MGyzOIKqaa	not that much, but yes a drop|`|w6lVjQigaa	I don't think so. This would be a massive price reduction and people who have already bought the PS3 would not be happy. However I could see why they would want to reduce prices in the current financial climate.|`|96ndKQncaa	Seriously?  I doubt that, if the nintendo ds lite isnt down to 60 new..  Ps3 isnt going to drop to 150.  if anybody does find out  i want to know so i can be in the uk when it happens lol|`|Ax8CiGIiaa	There might be a price drop for UK. Because SCEE President of Sony has said that PS3 will be getting more Competitive towards March end. This is the region for Europe, so more of the people from UK & US are really looking forward to this. But it has been confirmed that PS3 has got it Cell Chip Smaller to 45-Nanometers So there is a possibility on Price Drop. But Sony isn't going to confirm it ( Basic Marketing Strategy) they want to sell as many PS3 for High price. I also saw two days ago on Amazon of US they were selling it for US Dollars $350 and on official Dell computer site also.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	all the experts are saying ps3 are to be dropping their price followed by xbox 360 shortly after.   i have had a look at all the articles i could find and it seems to be speculation but on the other hand how will sony survive without a price drop they are fishes out of water at the moment with more consoles on their hands than they can shift.     the answer that used nindendo ds as an example for price cuts doesn't make any sense as nintendo are under no pressure to reduce their price as their consoles are still in high demand and the company has no financial difficulties. nintendo remain no 1 on the sales figures as they outsell playstation and x box hands down.   looking at this there is no reason at all for nintendo to drop price where there is every reason for sony to drop theirs.     if there is no price drop on playstation they could end up going bust they have to sell their consoles at a reasonable price to guarantee success it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see this.

xTioPxaVaa	A lot of this depends on the amp that you're going to use this with, and whether or not you need a lot of output from the pickup to overdrive the amp (or if you're using a pedal to do that for you).    A few local punk guitarists that I do work for are using Gibson P-100s.  Those are a humbucking version of the P-90s.  One guy swears by Seymour Duncan Custom Customs, and a couple of others like the old standby DiMarzio Super Distortion.  So, it's kind of all over the place.    One thing I would stay away from is the active pickups (EMGs, etc).  Those work well for very clean or very distorted tones, but they just don't seem to want to work in what I call the mid-gain breakup range (think Social Distortion).    Good luck.

AA11339865	Generally locked phones need passwords.  The default password sometimes is 1111 or the last 4 of the first owner's social security number.  As for the additional memory, you're stuck with what you have.  You could send the pictures to a computer to make room.  Depending on when you bought the phone you can get a discount on new ones.

Cl8FwsI2aa	Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a great game but if you don't like CoD: WaW, then you might not like it.    Also, try Halo 3, Gears of War, Gears of War 2, Fable II, Fallout 3, Left 4 Dead, Mass Effect, Forza Motorsport 2, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Street Fighter IV.    Good luck.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	Halo 3  Gears of war 2  Fallout 3  Left 4 dead|`|7yt2Ud0Faa	Depends on what kind of game you like.  Since you say, "don't say cod waw," I'm guessing that means you don't like first person shooters?  Or does that mean you already own that game?    If you like role-playing action oriented games, go for Fallout 3.  I'm hooked on it!|`|dWH6H2HVaa	your right waw sucks  if you want buy COD4 unless you already have it or wait for the new halo to come out its called Halo: Recon
DkSv6OZzaa	I'm assuming you bought it used from somewhere...if it was new I would have some concerns...but here's what you do to disable the parental control without knowing the password...    Go to parental controls on the wii setting. When it asks for your pin press "I forgot" and then it will ask you you question also press "I forgot". Then a screen will come up telling you your confirmation number. Write down the Confirmation number and go to http://wii.marcansoft.com/parental.psp and type in your confirmation number in the box then pick the date in your timezone (actually make sure you pick the date that your wii is set at!!!) and click "get reset code"    A "Master Key" will then appear a split second later. Type the master key pin into the mast key box that will appear after the confirmation key notice will appear. This will deactivate the parental controls. Then you will be able to leave it disabled or create your own PIN|`|AA11097657	Try 0000|`|7pzo0znAaa	Have you tried going into the settings menu and formatting the system memory?|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	1234?

MGyzOIKqaa	Here's what I do:  1. Download and install firefox  2. Download the "video download helper" add-on  3. Restart firefox to install add-on  4. Go to playlist.com, pick a song  5. Click the song name to play  6. The balloon icon for the add-on will start to spin  7. Click the arrow, and click the song you want (song name will be bunch of numbers, most recent listened to is at bottom)  8. The firefox save page will open  9. Save as songname.mp3 (don't forget the .mp3)  10. It will download in firefox  11. Open the firefox download's page  12. Right-click and hit open  13. It will open in your default music player (probably itunes on mac, or windows media player on windows)  14. It will be playing, then automatically add to library  15. Enjoy

CKRfaRYvaa	Is he on a different carrier from the others?  Maybe his account has a block on international texts.

If that doesn't work, try calling your customer service to have a technician check your account settings.

4KjLywFyaa	You can use some iPod-to-computer transfer program to transfer all songs/videos on your iPod Touch to another computer. I recommend Movavi iCopy - An indispensable addition to your iPod media library http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Movavi-iC...    It can help:   Transfer music and video from iPod to iTunes   Secure your iPod media content by copying it to your PC   Backup iPod music, podcasts, and videos in three simple steps   Move media content between multiple iPods   Enjoy your media files on any PC at work or at home   Work with all iPod models   Get all your iPod files automatically organized by playlists   Access all this functionality through an intuitive, straightforward interface    You can free download it to have a try from http://www.regnow.com/softsell/visitor.c...   Best luck!|`|Id5riyiJaa	If the songs and videos are protected (you downloaded them from iTunes) then yes. your iPod can copy those songs to a new computer (an iPod only recognizes 1 sync computer at a time). If the songs are not protected (you got them from a CD or other source), you need to transfer them to the new computer some other way, because to change the computer an iPod syncs to, it must delete everything off the HD and copy whats on the new computer.    If you can access both computers, you could transfer the music song by song using a flash drive, or possibly over a network.
jImYZiDqaa	Yep,    it's well made - good solid construction    Unfortunately I have had some problems.

That means not paying your forty cents a minute and get unlimited Canadian and Mexican long distance on weekends.     These plans give you less minutes per buck, and you have to have had Verizon service for three months on a regular plan before they will let you use this plan.    Hope this info was helpful
AA10309280	Hmm...I haven't even heard of it. The closest I've ever gotten to one of those kid cell phones was the firefly and that was only because my friend had one at the time.

However, this service is availble for many of the Sprint phones  for only ten dollars a month for a family size 2-5.     Certain phones also have parental blocking on them as well. I think its the Sanyo 2400 has it. With parental blocking parents can password restruct who can call your children and whom your children can call.    Its really neat. This type of phone I could see myself getting for my 8 year old if I had one.

It also comes with an Itune store where you can buy movies, tv shows, games etcc.. and add them to you ipod.

Lastly, call the apple company and ask, they may be able to help you. :)  Good luck!

zC3SLBKJaa	Hmm I have had a phone that operated voip... the pros... well in general long distance was free for me.. but I got charged some super fee for calling people within my state but weren't in my area code...  The phone service for the most part was pretty good... however...  It is possible to get degraded service with voip because some isp's throttle.(control the speed up/down). and even in some cases.. block voip data packets... if it isn't their own voip services.... ie... you might not be able to make calls.. or may experience poor quality voice...    do a search on net neutrality... thats relative to what Im talking about.|`|M8GRDINeaa	Well im a VOIP Service provider.. We concentrate on businesses.. and usually don't hassle with residential..    Thing with voip is that you need to know what your doing OR get a hand  to walk you trough it.    As previous guy said.. quality is not an issue when you know u need 64kbits for the audio.  so if you download stuff etc like movies.. it can afect unless you do QOS.. ( quality of service) on your line..    Can't really explain it all, but i would say. stay away from the big guys like vonage as they not only outsourced in a foreign crap country for support but also overloaded with mass marketing     You basically get what you pay for , us at contacttel.com we offer per minute only @ 0.0185 per minute.. vonage or other can sell you at 9.95 a month all included.. ( but then you read the fine prints and what not and see you get 4.95  for 911 fees.. 3.95 tax.. 2.00 extra this. .etc.. and they limit your unlimited access.. with a simple shut the account policy.  so basically we are now in a deception based economy where people oversell services and offsource support and sales to crap countries.. and we wonder why we are suffering...    Just make sure whatever co you choose.. you are ABLE to talk to someone for 20 minutes.. if you can do that.. you will be ok.

With the music it should work by just choosing the song in "my stuff", then entering "sounds".or by going to walkman    I don't know why the memory would mess up,mine doesn't, so maybe there's a defect or something    P.S. you may need to download new music because the type it comes with sucks|`|qBDL8iFxaa	no.  it sounds like yours is bad. take it back, and make sure you don't pay any money!|`|45XX4zeDaa	I have it and its an ok phone but just make the best of it have fun|`|iNfDcN9jaa	My asshole friend dose
7Z2JWAaoaa	The only thing i can suggest is completely drain the battery and then recharge, if it is still doing it then im afraid it may be a faulty battery, it happens. If not then make sure you top the battery up, but also let it drain fully every once in a while so the whole battery gets used, it could prevent furthur problems. Hope that helps.|`|poWyOGKCaa	Umm here is a tip GET A NEW ONE CHEAP ***|`|jtcf6xd4aa	I'am not a sparky but this problem happens to most of us at work its called a memory basically what happens is over time battery will not charge enough so rather if it in warrenty go talk to them but thats all i can say but if you do get a new one charge it the whole way and then flatten it completely and it wont have memory and should play like normal.|`|77NzfiVkaa	You just might be using it too much. Watching videos uses a lot of battery. If you are mostly just listening to music though you might need to either buy a new charger, a new battery, or just buy a new one. There is really no telling what the problem is unless you take it in to someone.
AA10848354	You need DVD ripping software like 1Click DVD, DVD Shrink, or CloneDVD.  You might also need something that can decrypt DVDs like DVD43.  1Click can copy and burn them for you.  DVD Shrink requires you to have a separate burning program like Roxio or Nero.  I hope this helps.    As far as DVD brands, I've never had trouble with any that I've tried.  I'm not too sure about the names.  Also make sure you know if your burner can burn DVD+R, DVD-R, or both.

They are just physically bigger, the housing is more prone to scratches, and have half the memory (stotage) that a Gen 2 has for the same amount of money.     If you already have one, and it has enough capacity, there is no need to get rid of it.|`|0401899a9491ba50e7a96eed563c6ebaaa	i have one and the only bad thing i have found is the instructional manual is virtually useless. have spent a lot of time on the phone getting the darn thing to work.|`|58119f0afc9e024481e534fae52d37a7aa	For the most part, no.  They do however get scratched easily, so a case is useful.  I also have had one for a year, and it did freeze once, but i reset it and it was fine.|`|AA11556428	I have one, and I haven't had any huge problems with it. I have noticed that sometimes after I set it on screen lock and turn it off, it won't register the code when I turn it back on, but all you have to do is reset it and it's fine. I haven't had problems with scratches, since I put a special clear cover over the screen when I first got it, but if you don't I've heard that they will scratch easily. The same goes for the actual iPod- it would be smart to keep a case of some sort on it at all times. I personally like mine since it's white and you can change the color with covers whenever you want, but the new one is nice too.
48f6723498b27b1e40d760cd6a6136dcaa	Depends on the game. Zelda has an option to turn off the pointer function, but you still shake it to swing your sword. Excite truck is almost all the tilt senor, so no option there.    I'd imagine nintendo requires all game producers to use the motion sensors. Just like they do with the touch screen on the DS. They demand it to get it "approved"    The motion sensor is fun though. Once you use it you won't want to turn off anything.|`|2b096231d58d9077eb14e04c7244872caa	i think you can. there should be a option to turn off the motion
381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	You can upgrade the hard drive from 20 gb to 60 gb or more.  The hard drive is removable.     But if you want to upgrade it to everything that the 60 gb has to begin with, then no.  The PS3 60 gb has slots for SD, Memory Stick, etc.  The 20 gb doesn't have any of those, and it's probably going to be impossible to get those into the PS3 20 gb.|`|13a05e5415c75f4b93896d89b15f075eaa	Do you mean memory or features with memory most likely yeah with features probably not.|`|3ea445b880caca04d705080451ca0d9baa	Perhaps|`|AA10048767	yes, it's something you can easily do from their instructions.|`|19cccd9de5f117f0b1d47ed1467011edaa	You can upgrade the Hard Drive to whatever you want (if you're handy with tools), but you'll probably have to get an external wifi adapter.  So you can upgrade it to be similar.  But if you upgrade the HD then you might as well just put in a 250gb drive rather than a 60.

YKc3YrxXaa	The songs should play perfectly on an iPod. If they don't work, you can always convert them to AAC codec on iTunes.Open iTunes, select Preferences and click on Importing.    Change the Import using drop down menu to AAC encoder. Select the bit rate you fancy, have it as high as the highest bitrate MP3 file you want to convert so you a losing as little quality as possible. Hit OK and close out of that menu.    Then in your iTunes Library window select the tracks you want to convert, an easy way to do this is to press Apple+A or Control+A on your keyboard to select all. If you need to sort then right click the iTunes Kind column header to sort by type.    When you have them selected right click on one of the files and choose Convert Selection to AAC and, well, thats it. Ta Da.    This wont delete your MP3 files, you will get AAC files alongside your existing MP3 files. Later, if you are happy, you can delete your MP3 files and save some diskspace.    If you want to remove all your MP3s after converting to AAC:    Firstly make sure you really want to do this, it will save space on your hard disk but personally I would reccomend that you burn all your MP3s to CD/DVD before deleting them.    Open iTunes  Select Library  Right click on a column name (Bit Rate or Name for example)  Make sure Kind is ticked as this shows you the file types  Click on the Kind column title to sort the file types  Left click your first MP3, hold down shift, left click the last MP3 in the list  Press delete    Hope this helps!!|`|vSKl7bTqaa	I have been using Aiseesoft Total Video Converter and you can free download it to have a try.  http://www.macsoftreviews.com/aiseesoft-...

uatPKvTsaa	The Mirror Cup is the exact same class of engine as 150cc BUT all of the courses are flipped. For example: instead of turning left on a course, you would turn right.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Mirror Mode is that something about the races is backwards. In some Mario Karts, it's just that left and right are flipped. On others, you actually drive the courses backwards. It automatically is the same difficulty level as the highest speed (150cc), and typically unlocked by beating all Cups on 150cc.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	mirror mode flips the coarse so it is like looking at a reflected image|`|rAmAvOo9aa	To unlock "Mirror" mode in Grand Prix, you need to come in 1st place in all the 150cc cups. Mirror mode reverses the course when you use it (not the controls). It's the most difficult as well. Hope this helped :)

MKv03mV0aa	Usually yes.  It will depend on the plan you have.  Verizon offers a "new every 2" type deal where they will let you upgrade to a new phone, receive a $50 new every 2 credit, offer "2 Year Contracts" prices, and even let you upgrade 4 months before your actual contract end date.      I have been Verizon back when they were AirTouch.      The Blackberry Storm was offered to me at $150 which half of the normal cost.  I got my wife's enV2 for $20.  I got my another phone for $0.00.  I ended up with the Samsung Omnia (awesome phone).    One thing is that you will still be responsible for the tax of the actual ocst of the phone.      I hope that helps.|`|YHPl2oV4aa	well it depends on which phone you have. some phones offer different free ones. look up your phone on verizon wireless and see if theres any free phones. hope i helped

0773c25c5ed22a82c88a8b19e6e55d60aa	Well if you took out the battery write away, their is a chance it maybe saved. First just drying it out wont do much good seance, it was pop that got inside it.     OK so you need to figure out how to open the case, look for screws in side the Bat compartment. Or their could be little plugs that pop out around the edge . Get it open and take Qtips and some alcohol . then dab it clean . The alcohol wont damage the circuitry . put back together and usually 50/50 chance but worth the try.|`|AA10276729	Once the soda dries it will leave a sugary thick syrup behind so it's probably ruined. And I don't think a dishwasher would work. The heat from it would probably ruin your screen. But as one poster said your best bet is to tear it apart and clean it with rubbing alcohol and cotton swabs. The rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly and doesn't leave a residue. plus it will help break the syrup and stuff up so the cotton swaps can get it all up. Most phones are held together by small torx screws. Usually around a T6 size. But if you don't feel comfortable tearing it apart then don't. It might be worth it to go buy a new one. Or maybe your phone company can warranty it. Check all your options. But hell it's already broke so you could give it a shot.  Good luck I hope it turns out for the better.|`|AA11605092	I can only say, pour some Jack in your soda, and you work care about the phone after a few of those|`|f2cc569f92bb1570b53bfbbc7466f8ffaa	Yeah, the sugar will cause problems once the liquid dries anyway.  If at all possible, you could CAREFULLY take the phone apart and clean out the guts with a cotton swab and alcohol.  It's worth a try.  Your phone is pretty much broken right now anyway.  It's not like you're going to break it any more.|`|AA10674420	at least it was better than my daughter dropping the phone in the toilet!

You are only eligible once every 2 years or so)     For sprint it is SprintRebates.com. I don't know about the others because I have only worked for sprint. When you check your rebate status it will usually inform you that you're eligible within 2 months of the end of you contract. This is a standard amongst the big Companies ie.

Option 2 - go to your networks website, and sign up to there version of account management, i.e T-Mobile calls there`s My T-Mobile, and then check when can I upgrade    Option 3 - Dial into your Networks IVR - where you check your Minutes and then following instructions and then Select upgrade and it will advise when you can upgrade, i.e T-Mobile IVR - 150 from handset and follow Prompts    Option 4 - Call your customer services, i.e T-Mobile 150 from handset and press 0 4 times and you will connect    Option 5 - Go to your nearest network retail store and give them your mobile number and they can advise.    kind regards    James
lS9J9Nrpaa	OMG, Lemonpillow! I just saw your question and clicked it, then realised we're friends on MySpace and Zedge - how weird!    Anyway, about your question - if you upgraded less than 14 days ago then you should be able to return the phone and choose another. As far as I know, all network providers allow customers a 14-day grace period in which they can decide whether to stick with their choice or change their mind. So if you're within this timescale then give Orange a call, explain you want to choose another phone, and they'll explain their return procedures - they all vary between networks. So make sure you have another phone in mind before you speak to them!    However, if you're over your 14 days then you don't have the option to exchange through Orange. But that doesn't necessarily mean you're stuck with it for another 18 months. You can always sell the phone privately or on eBay, and then use that money to buy a phone that you want. Selling on eBay is very easy once you've got a PayPal account sorted, which is compulsory nowadays if you want to sell.    There is nothing in your contract to say that you can't sell the phone because Orange are getting their money out of you every month with your line rental, so they don't care what you do with the phone. I'm on an 18 month contract with o2, due to upgrade on the 18th of this month, and I've had four different phones since my last upgrade!    Good luck!|`|SiOjEH00aa	i'l trade you a Samsung d900i on Orange for it ;)    or you could just sell it on ebay or at CeX for money and buy a new phone.|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi sarah let me start by saying ive experienced this problem with orange myself ! i had a contract with orange & i had a samsung f210 which was ideal for me travelling & listening to my music on it ! but when i got it the ringtones wernt loud enough i kept missing important texts etc the phone wasnt practical for my needs so i took the phone back to the orange store & was told that the phone could only be swapped for the same phone i couldnt have any other phone unhappy with this i then phoned orange customer service who told me exactly the same thing ! so the probability of them letting you have a different model is very slim ! ... hope this helps|`|86907ad9cce026f929aa1445843edac4aa	stars with Y .ends with  S|`|AA11433998	Yeah sounds like it, unless you want to go out and buy a new phone without a sim but that could be expensive.|`|AA12180617	the contract is with Orange and the ophone is irelevant you can buy an other phone at full unsubsidised price and transfer the SIM over and use the new one but that would cost you around 300..      or you could apply to early terminate your contract which would cost you the full price of the remiaining contract (eg 18 months * ) = 540.    As for another phone sorry experience has shown you fashionable and usable are different Avoid anything made by LG or HTC they may look good and trendy but are unreliable in use and break easily. Also never use anything (even the Samsung Omnia) running Windows mobile as its the worst phone system, unreliable, loses files and crashes regularly and rarely connects to computer/peripherals.    Samsung or Nokia or Apple offer much better easier to use and more reliable phones..|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes you have 14 days to change your mind|`|ldbinUfnaa	Yep, too late.|`|TJGje2blaa	Well, you can try to replace it for another phone of the very same, but if you signed a 18-month contract, they're not about to let you out of it without you paying for the entire 18 months.   So, you're obligated to pay it, whether you use it or not.

They cost way more than they're worth, and you should take this chance to buy some new 'phones.  The commonly recommended headphones in the Skullcrusher price range are Grado SR60s, and to quote a few people on head-fi.org:  "Take your 60$ and get a pair of grado-sr60s, they will rip any skullcandy phone apart." - myinitialsaredac  "[Skullcandy] SQ is pretty bad lots of reviews attest to that. have you tried senn HD280 or grados SR60/80s?" - johnation33  "Skullcandy are almost concidered a joke on this forum, basically the sound they deliver is very bad in comparison with other alternatives for the same price, such as the grado sr 60." and "I wouldnt touch skullycandies even with a stick" - Ttvetjanu  "Read up on Skullcandy and you see that its not a highly regarded brand around here. Enough said." - KRMathis  "The Skullcrusher is a fart cannon." -nickdawg    Look up Grado SR60s, you will find they are highly regarded by many audiophiles as a great low-end 'phone.  A little retro-looking, but I think you'll find one listen will make you realize what you're missing out on by not buying quality.

4KjLywFyaa	If those songs are still on your iPod, you can simply use an iPod-to-iTunes transfer program to help you, like iPod 2 iTunes http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-2-iT...    It is a handy program specially designed to help transfer all music/playlists/videos from iPod to iTunes in a direct way.    It will help you a lot whenever your iTunes, computer or PC crashed or you simply want to transfer one iPod library to any iTunes or computer. I like its easy, entire and safe transfer.|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	I would first check the hard-drive to see that the song files are still on your computer. Go to the file folder that's labeled with your name or username. From there, click on Music, then on iTunes. If your music files are still there, you're fine. You just can drag and drop the iTunes file folder into your iTunes library.    If they are no longer in that file, look in your recycling bin for the files. If you find them there, restore the files, then drag and drop them into iTunes.    If the files are no longer on your computer anywhere, but you have music on an iPod, you can use a program such as Music Rescue to rip the music off of your iPod and onto your computer. Once the files are saved to your computer, you can add them again to iTunes.    If none of the above solutions would work for you, you'll to re-download all of your music. If it's music from Limewire, that's no big deal. CDs can easily be re-imported. Any music bought and downloaded from iTunes, however, would probably be of highest concern. I would contact Apple to find out what your options are for retrieving the music at the lowest possible cost. Their support number is 1-800-275-2273.    Good Luck|`|Xed2cz4Faa	Well, are you on a different computer ?

In this case, all songs/videos are on your iTunes library that you can syn with whenever you wish to without losing any files.  It even has detailed guide.    Best luck!|`|sSEy6KYiaa	You can manage your iPod with different computers as long as the computers are running the same operating system (Mac OS X or Windows) and you have set the iPod to "Manually manage music." If you're not using iTunes 7 or later, click here.    Modes    By default iPod is set to "Automatically sync songs to my iPod" sometimes called automatic mode. In order to transfer music from multiple computers iPod must be set to "Manually manage music" sometimes referred to as manual mode.  Automatic Mode    When iPod is set to automatic mode iTunes automatically updates iPod's music library whenever you connect iPod to your computer. iTunes transfers new songs you've added, and erases songs you've removed. However, the first computer you connect iPod to is its "home" computer, and the music library from that computer is copied to iPod. When you connect iPod to another computer, an alert box appears with this message:        "The iPod "iPod" is synced with another iTunes library. Do you want to erase this iPod and sync with this iTunes library?"         "An iPod can be synced with only one iTunes library at a time. Erasing and syncing replaces the contents of this iPod with the contents of this iTunes library."    If you want to delete the music library on iPod and make the second computer iPod's "home" computer, click Erase and Sync. iTunes will delete all songs and playlists on the iPod, and then will copy the music library and playlists from the new home computer to iPod.  Manual Mode    If you want to keep the music library on iPod, but copy songs or playlists from the music library on the second computer, click Cancel to this dialog box, and then set iPod to manual mode.    You change the iPod synchronization mode to manual mode in iTunes:       1. Open iTunes, if necessary.  http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1202|`|Xed2cz4Faa	Whatever songs you have on your main computer, will then go on your ipod. If you have better songs that you like on your laptop, but then you plug it into your main computer with different songs, the songs that were on your main computer iTunes library, will go on your Ipod.    Make Sence ? (:      xoxo
ByhgBTvAaa	im pretty sure it is...although i havent completed it on the wii to know for sure...your best bet is to google it and find out!|`|Y2UjJAYSaa	no it isn't  i finished the credits and was eagerly awaiting this level  i was sadly disappointed though when after the credits it went right back to the main menu  :(
sZ8itOIQaa	You might as well buy and i-phone
Sdl3uOvKaa	AT&T is the only phone company that has the iPhone and I know, it sucks! I want an iPhone too but I have Verizon and sense my parents pay for my phone they won't let me switch.|`|sZGzUmLDaa	it comes on any plan you want to get for it|`|KNYF1hnhaa	Sprint uses CDMA technology meaning that they do not use sim cards.  The iPhone will only work on a cellular carrier using a sim card meaning that even if you got an unlocked iPhone you would not be able to use it with Sprint since they do not use sim cards for their service.|`|sk0pUe9Haa	no only att sorry!|`|QiWbcgWwaa	att only
7pzo0znAaa	I suggest that you NOT do it, b/c future software upgrades may brick your Touch!    A similar thing happened with unlocked iPhones recently; look up the details!    After that incident, many iPhone users were warned to not install the update, so those that hadn't already fell victim to the dreaded bricked iPhone syndrome had to miss out on all the new features until a fix had been discovered.|`|rvZXynxlaa	DON'T  I did it and it messed it all up and I couldn't listen to the music and play games all i heard was CRACK CRACK and when i tried to restore it the computer froze up and then i tried again and than the same thing happened. I was so desprate that i went to a friends house because it could of just been my computer, and her computer froze and made this WHIRLING sound and the screen went black. We had to duck down under the desk because we thought that it might explode, but it did'nt. than we tried to turn it back on and it wouldn't make a noise. Now i owe my friend a new computer and myself a new ipod touch.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Yes you will although WHY do you want to jail brake it?
mP8FFDkAaa	I say definently take it back, after all u have the reciept and its still in the box.
sSEy6KYiaa	You don't - that is why they are called PASSWORDS.    Your best bet is to go somewhere like a library or Starbucks or some place that has FREE wifi which is what you are using to get on the internet.    Lots of places have free wifi - Just Google Free + Wifi + your area.
sSEy6KYiaa	If you've locked the screen and have forgotten the code, then connecting the iPod to it's "home" computer will unlock it.    If the iPod has a code set, it asks you for the old combination before you can change to a new one. The only way to reset this would be to restore (http://www.info.apple.com/kbnum/n60983) your iPod.    iPod: How to use the Screen Lock (http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?...|`|RYVKYYnAaa	wow your screwed!|`|5aNHYpewaa	theres nothing apple can do, you can try going to an apple store and having it restored, delete all illegal music first!|`|1EJN1Giwaa	Put your ipod into recovery mode then plug it in and restore, this will delete everything on your ipod but it will be usable again.

fohBsMuDaa	well i had like alot of super advice for u... but then i saw it was a shuffle so idk if it would work...    ok if it got wet once and nothing happened...then it got wet again...in the toilet -_-...(assuming there was no...human waste in there) lol.    the problem mite of ben thet u turned it on right after it got wet...this ruins the circuting and the response time of watewver button...    for ur not turning off problem---wen u doint wana listen then maybe just pull the earphones out(part thet plugs into the ipod) and just let it saty on it will eventually die and then it will be off =)  on the down side...if u were listening to music.. and wanted to later...then ur outa luck...=/ sry  also if u didnt want to unplug then just pause...o    wat i would try is leting it die..then waiting...and see...although u didnt state if you could turn it on... if u cant then just ignore wat im saying..    if worst comes to worst...let it die get it wet again... DONT TURN IT ON...let it dry for like 3-4 days...and turn it on again... this is risky but no options+anoying broken ipod+ alot of luck=brand new ipod =D    it sounds crazy but it worked for me with my psp.. wich is way bigger...not that that has anything to do with it...  hope that helped =) and good luck...peace.=P|`|5aNHYpewaa	i would try restoring it, but also ipod shuffles are cheap, think about upgrading|`|Mj1dwsf5aa	CHECK THIS VIDEO.

5e564f59771ed76baf9cdea62df489eeaa	actually i text when i have something to say and  not always able to use my cell like at work it is a way to get around being on your phone when you are not in the position to be on the phone and still get your message across that is how i look at it there is no law that says you have to text just like if you make a phone call cause you want to have a conversation or you need to say something to a person texting is a very nice feature but it is not like you just have to text to be texting so i do not worry about texting subjects .|`|asjR1XYLaa	Start by saying hello and ask the person how their day was ask them how they're doing etc. etc. if the person wants to talk to you then you'll have a good conversation in no time good luck
5aNHYpewaa	YOU CANNOT JAILBREAK A SECOND GENERATION IPOD TOUCH!!!    ONLY THE FIRST GENERATION CAN BE JAILBROKEN    AND IF SOMETHING WENT WRONG YOU CAN RESTORE IT USING ITUNES.    Search youtube for tuturials for 1st gen touch|`|oM2p57Xlaa	It is possible to completely brick your ipod rendering it useless. I jailbroke my 2g ipod touch and have to admit it wasn't worth the hassle. The youtube videos make it look really impressive but you just end up getting annoyed with all the glitches and problems. I soon restored it back to the proper software as most games and apps on jailbreak end up on app store now. They are usually free or cost about 59p so i wouldn't bother.
CG2nboweaa	No, they would have to go to the local Sprint store, and ask for a printout. The only things that they can do online is, like check your minutes, and check how many texts you have used, and stuff like that.|`|NK1g8fIiaa	no.  Not from the bill.
mjsS54JXaa	Dial 611 from your phone, when prompted say Order Status, they will tell you when your phone is expected to arrive, if it is on backorder, ask to speak to a representative and complain, I got free shipping and a free bluetooth headset when I called to complain. My order was almost 2 weeks late.|`|YsqxvCxdaa	I would call and complain. Or maybe check the status of you order on the wedsite you ordered it off of. Some have it and some don't.
km2rYhTcaa	a laptop|`|7pzo0znAaa	The Sony Mylo is a good communicator device with media features. It also has Skype capabilities.|`|8Q8ZVwjnaa	Well if there are any they will be smartphones like the itouch.. And will cost around the same amount.|`|0hzRP9Oiaa	The itouch and iphone are currently the only wi-fi capable mp3 players that allow you to chat that i know of. You can also use your mobile phone. My LG Dare uses aim, msn, and yahoo chat. There may be something different over seas (Europe, Japan, China) but that costs more to get.
5aNHYpewaa	This might be a factory defect, id go to a apple store and change it for a new one|`|Bbn1ZSTcaa	Send it into Apple and they wil fix it or give you a new one.|`|km2rYhTcaa	ask them 2 give you another|`|yCgs8gf4aa	get a new one, and tell them that its not working right..  or read the manuel and find out how to reset it.
mQbVBi9Waa	Ok first off you are going to have to pay full price on what ever phone you but unless your 2 year activation is up and you get the discount and second if you buy a blackberry with Verizon you have to pay $30 each month for the blackberry plan even if you do not want the plan.|`|CG2nboweaa	I think that, you really should talk to the people over at your local Verizon Wireless store. They would better assist you. But from my point of view, I think you would deff. have to pay a full price for a phone, unless you choose to do a 2 year contract, and then it would be free, plus you would get possibly a rebate.    Hope I helped!|`|5aNHYpewaa	If you renew your contract at the time opf purchase, you will not have to pay retail price, and possibly get a rebate.    if you break phones quickly i wouldnt suggest buying the blackberry, its very sensible and honestly a horible phone, you should try an lg dare.|`|mjjrSrBAaa	Yes, I've heard that the En-V is a bad phone.    But if you get a new phone, you definitely WILL have to pay full retail price.    The best thing to do, if you want, is to go on ebay or some website, and buy a new phone that's not activated. One that works for verizon.    Then, you just pay a few dollars for verizon to switch you over to that phone.|`|zkCH7PN5aa	Youl have to pay full retail which is ridiculously expensive either way. im sorry. its unfortunate.    And no they wont give you a deal either. im sorry.

You can take any SIM card (pay as you go or contract) and place it in any suitable (network compatible) handset.|`|2hfVdOu2aa	what ever is on that sim will go to the new or watever phone  say you have a new phone with a new sim with a bill just paid  and i stole it that phone and took the sim put it in my phone your new paid bill, i can use up until you report stolen  so be super careful!|`|FjSopNyhaa	yeh it stays on the sim card|`|u7n7jslRaa	if its the same network ,yes o2 till o2 Vodafone till Vodafone and so be careful you may loose all your numbers make sure your phone numbers are on the sim and not to your phone you will get husbands and yours all mixed up,|`|eXbgLXgCaa	tell your husband its definitely on the phone(you calling from!!). this way you'll be right as ever-)|`|AA12121752	It goes with the SIM.|`|yorfmfiBaa	The phone is just the shell, the sim card in the heart of the device, and it carries your plan and service, and helps you acquire reception. So, to answer your question, if you pull your active sim out of your phone and put it into an unlocked phone ,it will carry over your service, features, and balance on your account.  Billing and devices are two separate entities. At least thats how it is from T-Mobile and ATT, if you have another random service it may be different.|`|Xverqpu4aa	Goes with the card.|`|DVmDWDC4aa	Credit is assigned to the phone number, on the sim card.

bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	From a phone standpoint, the Slvr L7 is a much better value. At $89.99 with no contract to sign, this phone is a steal.  Slvr is Quadband and can be used anywhere in the world  Samsung is only a dual band (only good for america)  Slvr comes with a 512 memory card, that in itself is worth almost the price you would pay for the samsung. The slvr can be used as an mp3 player because of the expandable memory, the Smasung cannot.  If you ever want to sell the phone, the Slvr will have a MUCH higher resell value.   Comparing these 2 phones really is not fair, you are comparing a BASIC Samsung to a more advanced Motorola  Cheers|`|462c794110ca391c9f850d1a7ffe7b10aa	honestly: neither. get the razr for the low price of 20$!!!

Jwk7Ib2vaa	If you mean "uploading", it's quite easy. When you connect your iTouch, go to the tab where it says pictures. You can literally click the folder that has the pictures you want, and iTunes will sync them w/ease.  Hope this helps, and if it doesn't, try using another word other than pass to get your question understood more clearly.
zcXk7Cdbaa	For a replacement I think you may need insurance (not positive) and the'll give you a phone for the same price as the ENv2 or give you a discount on a different one.

But for simple entertainment, I would actually go for the Wii. :)    I have a 360 and I am impressed by the graphics quite often :)|`|F0nJbK53aa	Well! I have a 360 and my friend has a PS3.  I really love Sony but my boyfriend wanted Skate for the 360, so we got the xBox.  The graphics on both are superb.  I can't really tell the difference of which one is better.  I suppose you'll have to look at the types of games you want.     Most game companies that normally only made games for the PlayStation are making games for xBox360 AND the PS3, however, a lot of new games are being made only for xBox360.  Take Final Fantasy for instance.  They announced at the endish of last year that they were going to release the new FF for xBox and PS3 when they use to be strictly Sony.  But then you look at Little Big Planet which is only for the PS3.    Take a look at some of the games you are interested in playing, console wise, and see which console weighs down.  Then you know which one to pick based on how many games you will take the time to enjoy.    DVD wise.  It just depends if you want BluRay or not.  PS3 with BluRay versus the xBox360 built in dvd player with HD-connectors.    And as for the monster PC, do you really want to have friends over to sit around your desk breathing down your neck, playing video games with you?  Or would you rather have them all lounging around a TV in the living room or something?      =] Hope this helps!|`|8G3T0JJVaa	of course not. if you had a woopa$$ pc 3ghz quad, 8gig ram, 10,000rpm hard drive, 500$ + video card you would not need a ps3/xbox 360. these pcs are expensive but you upgrade them and build them yourself with 2000$|`|PlsSd5vKaa	i would say the 360 because it has better online but the console itself has many problems, so its your choice. If you like to play online, get the 360, but get the warranty no matter how much extra it costs! But if you play by yourself or with friends PS3.|`|W3EXskhXaa	Depends on the money you want to spend.    If you want a better system you'll have to pay more. But if you are looking to buy one cheap the 360 is your best bet. Overall the Playstation 3 has better graphics because its compatible with 1080p high def cords where as the Xbox is only compatible with 720p high def. cords.  Plus with the PS3 you get a high def blue ray player as well which sells for roughly $200+    Like I said, the more you pay, the better the system. But if you don't have money its an easy decision.|`|WiaMtrnyaa	LOL. Great subject to ask online.lol its just like football one likes one team and others like other teams same way with ps3 and  Xbox i grealy perfer the 360 but then again from what i saw ps3 is ok to its just a madder of opinion i like the Xbox better.

UAYzLyN4aa	Yes, HDTV is a type of digital TV. You can have digital TV that is not high def, but (as far as we consumers are concerned) you can't have high def TV that isn't digital at some point in the path.     i.e. there is no broadcast or cable source of analog, high-def TV. Direct-to-home satellite has always been digital, it's just recently been upgraded to include HD channels.    Note that this does not mean you can't use component cables (which are analog) for high def. You most certainly can do that, say from a HD cable box, or HD satellite box, or BluRay player, to the TV. The "digital" part is in how the signal gets to those sources, not necessarily in the final connection to the TV.    Later: Uh... Aaron... I *said* you could use component cables. See paragraph above. But I challenge you to find a high def source available in the home that did not use digital for the transmission or the signal source. HD over the air? Digital. HD over cable? Digital. HD from satellite? Digital. HD from BluRay? Digital. HD from an Xbox  360 or PS3? Digital sources again. Even if you are using component cables for the connection from "box" to TV, the source is still digital in all of these cases. The closest to your idea would be an HD camera with component out... and those do, of course, exist... but the image sensor + processor is still a digital source; the camera has to convert it to analog component.     Aaron also writes:    > However, some older TVs that are not high definition can   > also pick up digital signals,    No, just the opposite: Some older TVs that ARE high definition do not have digital (ATSC) tuners and so canNOT pick up digital signals; they must be used with some other HD source such as an HD cable box or BRP. There was never a non-HD TV made with an ATSC (digital TV) tuner.|`|KJLFVjoraa	Digital Television covers both Standard Definition and High Defiinition.|`|LMk6z9s1aa	Digital television is different from high definition television.  Digital television refers to the type of signal that is broadcast from the TV station tower.  Whereas, high definition television refers to the quality of the television signal.  If the digital television signal is of high enough quality, then it is considered high definition.    High definition televisions are usually able to pick up digital signals, because they have built in digital tv tunars.  However, some older TVs that are not high definition can also pick up digital signals, but you usually have to have a digital converter box to pick up the digital signal.    By the way, Sullivan doesn't know what he is talking about.  You can have high definition TV that is not digital.  It is called component.
XFQQ0ZtXaa	If you're absolutely sure it's not because you're not very good at the game itself, the problem is most likely the fact that you're playing on a carpet. Try doing one of the flowing:    -Put some extra "padding" under the Dance Mat. If you happen to own an exercise mat, that would be perfect. Otherwise, try something along the lines of a rug.  -Sometimes the mat can slide around under your feet while you're playing without you realizing it. Either set something on each corner of your mat to hold it in place (Like a book or two), or simply tape it to the carpet (One piece on each side should be more than enough).
HBNx77BBaa	That wouldn't hurt it. I think the main reason they tell you to fully charge is so you don't have it go flat after ten shots and get upset with them.    Cameras run down their batteries very quickly. You can expect to charge them at the end of every day that you have used them, so if that's what you're finding, its just normal.    Update: fhotoace is right that lithium ion, which your camera uses, is a resilient battery. There's even protection circuitry in the battery so it can look after itself. There has to be in this type of battery. Some cheap lithium batteries don't have it though, so if you ever get a second battery for the camera make sure that it's from a good supplier.    Unless it's stopping you from using the camera I wouldn't worry too much about the battery indicator. If you can see them, try wiping the contacts of the battery with a soft cloth just in case there's any grease on them. If the camera just isn't useable then you should return it for a refund. You may not be able to get a replacement Vivicam because the Vivitar name has been purchased by Sakar. The existing range of Vivitar cameras has been discontinued. My son has a Vivicam 5199 which he loves and I've got my fingers crossed that it lasts for a long time.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	actually, you should charge it all the way|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It depends upon the battery .... Li-ion batteries are the most robust of all the rechargeable batteries used in digital cameras.    Two things can damage them 1) leaving them discharged for any length of time 2) overheating them during charging .... The chargers that come with the camera, have built-in circuitry to protect from that happening.    Always fully charge your battery ... placing them in the charger the night before you plan on using it is a good practice    Some of the problems concerning battery longevity has to do with energy management or lack thereof.    Keep the LCD off as much as possible (the more you use it to show your images to friends, the less shots you can take with it between charges).  Every time you use the flash, more energy is consumed.    If you look in your cameras owners manual, you will see there are a number of shots per charge, not a time given.    I have an old P&S camera that will shoot about 270 images before I have to recharge its battery.  I have a DSLR that can take in excess of 1000 shots per charge.  Each camera is different.
ZQeXKdrAaa	Music - Any lossless, these are only compressed in the way a zip file is compressed, there is no removal of data.  The most common format is FLAC, although there is also AAC lossless and WMA lossless, as well as APE, and I think OGG is lossless.  These all keep every bit of data from the original file, and generally are in and around the 1000kbps mark (depending on the song).  The quality is undeniable.    For video, I have no clue.

4Pk6VNftaa	If you're going with broadcast - digital or not - you'll need an antenna of some sort.    This can be a small set-top antenna, like a set of rabbit ears, or one of those larger models that used to be attached to everyone's rooftop.    What type of antenna you'll need depends on what stations are in your area, and how far you are from the broadcast towers.    This website has a bunch of information on choosing an antenna that's right for you, based on the address of your house and other options:    www.antennaweb.org/    Another option you may want to think about is downgrading your cable service to just "basic cable".  This will get you the local broadcast stations (analog, digital, and HD) for about $10/mo.  You don't need a cable box, and you won't need a new digital converter either.  Simply plug the cable from the wall directly into your TVs.|`|UAYzLyN4aa	You will need an antenna.

zfueTHk2aa	Okay....    First off, the digital switch just means your received signal will be a digital feed and not an analog feed. If you currently have cable or satellite then you are receiving a digital signal. With it being that you did not need to have a converter box, you're not receiving a digital signal. Your system is already set up for digital. If you're currently using your VCR, then it will continue to work. You will experience no change in the switch.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Do you subscribe to cable TV (Comcast, Time Warner, etc) or satellite (Dish, DirecTV)?  If so, then nothing will change for you.    If, on the other hand, you use a TV antenna, then you will need to get a digital tuner for your VCR.  Note that when you connect the tuner to your VCR, you'll need to set the tuner to the channel you want to VCR to record.  The VCR's tuner won't be used anymore.    Another option you have is to ditch the VCR and move into the 21st century with a DVD recorder.  This works exactly like the VCR, but uses blank DVDs instead of VCR tapes.  Some even come with a hard drive, which gives you additional storage space.  DVDs that are recorded with a DVD recorder can be "finalized" which allows them to be played on any DVD player.  However, the best thing about DVD recorders is that newer models come with the digital tuner built-in.  So you won't need a separate tuner box for them.  Simply plug them in the same way your VCR is connected now.|`|67102a0eb9d2399d50d1ca170ca8a7eeaa	You will be fine. The only difference is that antennas will no longer work. Since you already have digital TV you don't need to do anything and yes, you will still be able to use and record on your VCR.

To be honest, I don't think you're ready for that camera, especially if you're only 14 and you're just barely getting into photography.  It's a digital SLR (Single Lens Reflex) and it's intended for more advanced users.  Do you know how to use manual exposure?  Are you familiar with basic photography, like how to focus and how to set the aperture and shutter speed manually?  If you're just looking for a "cheap" digital camera, and you're just going to put it in auto mode and take snapshots, then you are NOT ready for that camera.  Digital SLR's are expensive (at least $400) and even if you buy a used one online, it's still probably going to sell for around $300.    If you're seriously interested in photography, and you are ready to start using manual exposure, then go ahead and get that camera.  It's a great camera.  But if you're just looking for a digital camera, and someone told you to get a DSLR, and so you're just rushing out to buy one based on what someone told you...then you're wasting your money.  (Or actually, your parents' money...right?)    So what would you consider "cheap" ?  Look in camera shops in your area.  But I seriously doubt you'll find even a used one for less than $300 at least.  Digital SLR's are NOT cheap.    If you really want a fully manual camera, then another option is a 35mm film SLR.  You can find one in good condition for around $150 (or sometimes even less than $100).  I know film is not popular or "cool" but the truth is that you can get very sharp, clear pictures with film, and a 35mm film SLR will give you more practice with using manual exposure.      I know I'm going to get voted thumbs down.  That's fine.  But I think you're just going to wind up using that DSLR camera as if it was a cheap point and shoot camera...and really, that defeats the whole purpose of getting an SLR.

imaeeL9Naa	After ripping have you looked in your Music blade?    1) Insert the Music Disk into the 360.    2) A screen should appear with it showing a visualization picture and showing the tracks (songs).  If it doesn't appear, go to the dashboard scroll across to the Multimedia section and go to Music.    3) Up the top of the screen it says options like "Burn and Rip".  Choose "Rip" and it'll copy the songs from the disk onto the 360. Give it time to finish.    4) And it should say your done. And it's saved onto your 360.    You can also press the guide button and go to media to navigate to the music section.    ~ Shoe|`|LcuRdzhDaa	idk

Cl8FwsI2aa	Personally, I wouldn't, but it's your choice. The Xbox 360 has better games than the PS3. Xbox LIVE is a reason, alone, to keep the Xbox 360. The PS3's online play isn't good and I'm being polite. The PS3 can play Blu-ray movies which is the only good thing about it. Also, the PS3 has some cool exclusive titles such as Killzone 2 and MGS4. Gears of War and Halo 3 were rated higher than Killzone 2 by IGN.    Good luck.|`|Hb04EISQaa	xbox it is!!!|`|elOeLQTpaa	Definitely not. Unless you have your heart set on a blu-ray player because that is all the PS3 is good for.

MGS4 is rumored to be coming out on 360, and LittleBigPlanet is just plain gay.|`|59Rd381caa	You shouldv'e asked in the Playstation section. Now all the Xbox fanboys will trample you with Xbox.

Ea3JQDibaa	you have to download the update or you  can change the file format
pjbdDi2Oaa	first of all DONT DO ANYTHING! You have to call your provider and they can give you that number. You can end up locking up your entire phone if you enter the PUK wrong too many times (i think it gives you 3-5 tries) If you already locked up the phone you might be able to get a new sim card, but sometimes you have to call the manufactorer of the phone (samsung, motorola, etc) and they can give it to you. Sometimes people have to buy all new phones. Seriously dont touch anything yet and bring it in to your wireless provider.|`|RAxe7X3xaa	Take it to your carrier's local store.

7pzo0znAaa	The highest resolution the Wii can output is 480p, so the best you could do is to find a Wii Component cable & use that for your HDTV, but in my experience, the difference isn't that significant.    I bought one for my HDTV, but is wasn't that much better, so I put it on the old 32" tube TV in my bedroom b/c it happened to have a component input.  It looks better in that sense, much better than the standard cable.|`|raEUval8aa	The Wii does not play in HD.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Try using component cables to upgrade from 480i to 480p.

r9I6kpwDaa	As far as I know, you can't.   You should post an add on craigslist or something to try to find the person, maybe you can at least get a reward for the whole thing.    The only other option I can think of is taking it to an apple store or sending it in to apple, but I am not sure they will do that if you aren't the legal owner.     That's what I would do though.

gfBnC4zdaa	I would advise you to get a second opinion, but to the best my knowledge T mobile & Orange work on a frequency of about 1800  mhz , and Voda phone & 02 work on 800 or 900 mhz.As far as i know the networks in America and some other parts of the world work on something like 1900 mhz, now 3 mobile i was led to believe piggy backs on the T mobile network, but i am not sure it is on the same frequency .

There is nothing like it on the web today    and you can make animations and graphics            or     follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.

732c53bd23ec21418e9a02c0dff8ef43aa	If you're using a first gen iPod touch, there isn't a microphone option - the hardware isn't there to support it.

AA11068631	I have a similar model, but not identical.  I know mine takes WMV (Windows Media Video) files.  You should be able to convert using Windows Media Player, or Mediamonkey.  I've only ever used BBC IPlayer to watch videos, so I've not tested this advice yet.  I hope this helps, though.
YHPl2oV4aa	well if this helps at all, i have verizon wireless. if you buy a phone from verizon at retail price, you take it home, log into your account on verizonwireless.com and then if you go to your number, theres something that should say activate equipment. click that and then they will ask for some codes, which are found under where the battery sits. hope i helped!|`|qBDL8iFxaa	take it to the store.  thats the only way in your place

X4xGKImeaa	What you need is just DRM remover software. I recommend one that could legally remove any DRM protection and convert iTunes video, music, movie and other popular video & audio even HD video. With this powerful DRM remover, you can customizable output profiles with your own style.  http://www.dvdtoitunes.net/itunes-drm-re...  Also, you can search some other software:  http://www.ask.com|`|298f53028838b8c79f30ac0f6b2c75d6aa	They usually can, as long as the files are unprotected. If you add music to iTunes that's in WMA, iTunes will typically ask if you would like to convert the files. However, if the files have a DRM-license protection, it won't convert them. These would be files downloaded from legal music services such as Napster or Ruckus. If this is the case, you need to find a way to remove the DRM-protection before importing the music into iTunes.
CKRfaRYvaa	There aren't any.  The only way to get a discount on a phone is if you're eligible for an upgrade or you're starting a new line of service, and both of these options require new contracts.  And yes, any Blackberry is going to be expensive because they are high end professional devices.
LzSj90pbaa	This type of question is asked very often, and the only answer is 'define the word best'. Do you want an easy to use phone? Do you want the phone with the most features? do you want the phone with the most features for the price?   Next, if we start naming phones, without knowing what you need in a phone, every recommendation we give you could be a terrible choice.|`|5e564f59771ed76baf9cdea62df489eeaa	i hear the fuze is a nice phone it is the upgrade of the tilt but i also hear the fuze is a complicated phone . personally if i get a smart phone i am interested in the samsung omnia that i hear at&t is suppose to be getting in a couple of months so you be the judge . the fuze does have a keyboard.|`|trd7tkEdaa	I have the BlackBerry Bold & I love it.

Bugs are caught with a net, and some bugs require a shovel (some like to nest in the ground, and need to be dug up, some hide in rocks, and need to be scared out with a thwack from your shovel.)    Paintings are bought from Crazy Redd's.  He changes his stock on Wednesdays.  Blathers won't accept forgeries, which Redd is known for selling often.  However, one of the the effects of proper Feng Shui in your house is an increase in the odds that Crazy Redd will have an authentic painting.  The last 4 paintings I've bought were authentic, but the first 2 were fakes.  There is no way to tell if a painting is a forgery until you try to donate it.    To donate, go into the town hall, go up to the counter, as ask about the "Town Fund."  The first town upgrade is the bridge, and it is built after 200,000 bells have been donated.  The Fountain is built after another 400,000 bells have been donated.    Read up at Gamefaqs for more info  http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/game...

Bru5jJZraa	You can set up on your landline to an unlimited calling plan to Canada. My bf is in Canada too, and thats what I have. It doesn't charge him, as long as I call him. If he calls me, it'll charge of course. I believe its around $50/month..    Theres also calling cards, their really expensive though. It's about $10 a card, for about 300 minutes. It gets pricey, depending on how much you love talking to that person :)|`|ANcCxdEfaa	If you use a US cell phone to call *any* number in Canada, you'll get long distance charges.    I was in a similar situation and my solution was Vonage.    I set up Vonage in the US and used a virtual number to cut costs.    You can do the reverse.  Set up vonage with the area code of your home.  Then set up a virtual number for your area code in California tied to your Canada home.  That way, when you call, you are making a local call but the number will go to Canada.  Problem solved with minimal and predictable costs.    I know it sounds complicated but www.vonage.com will explain it all better.    The bill was about $30 per month for the US account, unlimited calling.  It's slightly more for the Vonage.ca account...

BMConIedaa	AC:CF is the same game as AC:LG2TC.  They only difference is what country they are sold in, and what holidays are celebrated.    1.  Wisp's visits are extremely rare.  With some other visitors, Booker (the dog in the gatehouse, on the right) will normally know if you have a guest visitor.  Not so with Wisp.  Wisp appears on random weekdays.    2.  You get music from K.K. Slider, who plays music at The Roost (Brewster's cafe in the museum) every Saturday night from 8 to midnight.  He first appears at 7:30, but won't play until 8.  The first time you see him, he picks a song for you, but every subsequent week, you can either have him choose a song at random, choose a song based on your mood, or you can request a song by name.  He'll always give you a recording of the first song he plays each time he comes (it will appear in your pockets after the song).  You can then take that item and add it into your stereos.  This is the only way to get music.    Read this faq for more info on both of your questions.  http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/wii/file...|`|37TowRL7aa	1.

Wisp is just a ghost, like Boo from the Mario series, with a genie hat on his head. You need to find his lamp for him. Check in trees(shake them), fish, dig, it might be laying down somewhere. His rewards are Remove current weeds in your town, smash cockroaches in house(only if you have some, don't waste on this one) and get a rare item.    Go to the museum at 8pm-12 pm on a Saturday, go to the first room on your left. It'll be the Roost, there will be a dog on a stage, talk to him and he'll play a song, then give you music. Then input the music into your stereo. BTW, to turn off the starman or oids, just face them then press C or A.

If it's not their D807 crashing and losing its ability to perform as a cell-phone (voted on many websites as the lowest rated and worst phone on the market), its the Blackjack with internet issues (more specifically the OZ IM client spamming users with text messages that they have to pay for) or the Sync with well, syncing issues (loading music to it from a PC, where the PC does not recognize any device attached). I'm not sure about the D900 because I'm not as familiar with it, but if it follows Samsung's trend in cell-phones I'd stay far away from it, no matter how much or less it costs.     What I can do is refer you to a website that may help, www.phonescoop.com has user ratings of phones new and old, you may want to look there for other people's experiences with it.|`|5f07cd6774b637fc013e4e8b2d6decbfaa	Samsung SGH-D900 is a old phone go for something newer and the resolution on the D900 is not that great.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Yahoo doesn't charge, but your cell company charges either or a per minute internet charge or a monthly flat rate for unlimited use of the internet.    Cellular companies will also charge for an extra service that will make your phone ring when you get an email. That  s a different charge on top of the internet charges.
7MLHrmKBaa	no it is only for cingular because there is also a 1 dollar a month feature that has to be on your account for it to put the tone assigned for your ring back tone because with answer tones unlike ringtones it doesnt download to your phone but is just saved as a option for your phone on the network.  other companies have them too but no prepaid and not virgin mobile sorry hope that helps.|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Other companies use other names for it call back tones ringback tones.

bSCIZGWbaa	i cant really give you any support apart from call apple and put an elastic band round the iphone to keep the invisible shield down (thats what i did) then take it off when it is stuck down, hope this helped|`|bJgz5xGzaa	haha damn invisible shields! i ended up taking my back cover off.  looking at mine i cant see how to fix this type of thing unless there is a way to suck it back out to its original position?  maybe you could take it to an apple store and see if they can help.  good luck!

4KjLywFyaa	All you need is an iPod-to-computer transfer program. I personally quite like using Tansee iPod Transfer http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee-iP...    It can help you transfer all songs/videos on your iPod to your new computer perfectly, and then you can easily add those files to the new iTunes library. Proven easy and secure.   It even has step-by-step guide.  Best luck!|`|nxtIhb4Oaa	You can copy the music and films from iPod to computer for backup at first, if you don't know how to do that, I think this guide would help you a lot  http://www.freedvdripper.net/how-to-tran...

26zfOKYNaa	check em out at verizonwireless.com.  If you already have an account and just want a data plan for unlimited web n email thats 29.99.  Plus you can add text messaging if you dont already have it. It just adds on to your voice plan.  Unless you want no voice and just web.
GaflwNn7aa	based on the review i've read in the source below, if you were to switch to verizon, it would be even more expensive.  based on coverage and service, i think at&t is the way to go.  if you switch to verizon, you pay more, if you switch to any other provider, you'll save a few, but you'll get worse coverage and service.|`|u5F22mEbaa	I don't know the cost, but apparently Verizon has the best coverage in the continental US - I have Sprint, which I hate (bad coverage) but got in so early that I only pay 16.00 per month !  Its not worth switching, as I only use it occasionally.|`|QaM3Fx0maa	I us koodo it works great for me.

RAxe7X3xaa	In iTunes, select your iPod (when connected) on the left list.  Then on the top, select the pictures/photos tab.  Uncheck everything and make sure no check next to sync my pictures folder.|`|oVr2FvMOaa	Go on your Itunes & plug in ur itouch and press Photos. a list of all your photos should come up. And    you kno how theres boxes with checks next to every photo? well pres uncheck selection, a faster way would be go to the last picture click it. press shift and up arrow and wait till it gets to the very first picture and every one will be blue. right click.  press uncheck selection. all of them will be off ur ipod or itouch if u then press sync or apply or what ever it says at the bottom left of itunes. Hope this works, or helps, in any way. Good luck if u dont understand what i said add details to ur questioon saying more info or somethin. good luck (again) :D|`|qGuyZ3qhaa	ha ha|`|rVPrhd26aa	i'm confused... do you mean you cut them off your computer and put them on the ipod? If so your are screwed because ipod doesn't let you take files off it... it's a one way road so you can't go to your friends house with an ipod and give them all your music. You might be able to salvage them from the temp space on your hard drive, when files are deleted they are still on the drive until they are overwritten by new data (even when you empty the trash). That's very technical stuff though. good luck|`|pU7syaZVaa	you can actually delete the pics from your ipod touch. just go to your pictures and then click the pics you want to delete and tap the screen once and it should come up with a trash can icon tap that then select delete. do that for all of them one by one :L|`|AA12180617	you do this in the itunes and not the ipod.. ipod is a slave that does what itunes tells it to and not the other way round!!      remove they link in itunes then sync the ipod again and the pictures will be removed form teh ipod.
qGuyZ3qhaa	yes

8XS7xeiXaa	www.funformobile.com|`|nU8j6kdiaa	http://www.myventones.com    they have millions of free ringtones    or you can upload and make your own ringtones for free.     You can make the ringtones from MP3 files or YOUTUBE videos. There is nothing like it on the web today    and you can make animations and graphics            or     follow these steps and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and  click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me
siAPVQwDaa	I just got my Wii to the internet, if you have a computer that has the internet, (this is what I did) go buy a wireless router mine cost me 37.00 at wal-mart and its a NETGEAR. Install it on your desktop and then follow the steps to get the Wii connected.|`|KfkmB4X2aa	You need a broadband connection (cable or dsl). Wiis can't use usb accessories meant for computers and they can't use dialup.
iVcrRwSDaa	Try simply holding the strum up. Occasionally, if I'm touching the strum when I turn my Wii on, it acts like I'm still holding it down even when I'm not. If I restart my Wii, it usually fixes the problem. Or, if I'm too lazy to do that, I just hold the strum up and it stops on an option until I let go of it.     If that doesn't work, it looks like you'll be needing to buy a new guitar.|`|LWbfPPCvaa	tough luck buudy. guess you have to get a new guitar.|`|OpCYOra3aa	well i dont see any way of fixing it so  GO TO THE STORE AND GET A NEW ONE

Yeah lol, i've bought most of them from HK too, those things are really cheap and doesn't really work, i'd just say don't waste anymore money on those =\ I guess if you could contact the store in HK and ask them, but most stuff you buy from HK is not returnable..but you can give it a try

1vaqtRI2aa	I think if you prove to her how mature you are, she will get you one.    My sister got hers when she was 11 because she's extremely mature, didn't beg and has a lot of activities. Some good reasons are that you take the bus and there could be an emergency, you're at a friends house, etc.    Good luck!      PS., prepaid phones cost you more in the long run. Ask your mother if you can pay the $10 a month for a regular phone added to your mother or fathers plan.|`|xbISxnmfaa	Well maybe your mom doesnt want to pay for one. I guess it would be a good way to reach them in case something happened to you at school, but other than that I cant think of anything. 11 is kind of young for a cell phone I can see if you were in high school then that would be different.|`|jaAolejUaa	everyone else has it..    what other reasons do you want, seriously your parents had there 1st probably when they started working, yes i know we are in the age of technology, but hey they survived w/o it, y cant u?|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	The most ovious reason to be able to tell your parents were u r going and stuff.|`|0cf4Qja5aa	911 and I need to be picked up MoM!    safetymax out!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	print off the pedophile/sex offenders list for your area and show it to her.

I got my phone in the 3rd grade...my parents MADE me have a phone because of emergencies. I hated having a phone. Back then (5-6 years ago) no kids my age had a phone. It was embarrassing to HAVE a phone. Now my neice in the 1st grade has a cell phone. I really think she NEEDS one. What if she misses the bus? What if some kid tries to beat her up? What if she gets sexually abused? What if she gets lost? What if....I could go on all day.|`|eh7O4b4Paa	Incase u get mugged.|`|SY3aYLMraa	There are none apart from safety reasons.  Just be thankful your mum IS going to get you one and wait.|`|oxuSiBwxaa	Say something along the lines of safety purposes so your mother can keep in contact with you whenever you go out with friends. it may sound kinda cheesy but it worked for me=)|`|vtm8lpFDaa	The best reason is like you said, when something is canceled you can call someone to pick you up. Other than that, I can't really think of another good reason. Or you can tell her if SHE needs to find you, it's easier if you have a phone. You're only 11.. If you want your mom to get you a phone, help out more around the house. Show her that you're a responsible and good kid. Earn it instead of ask for it.|`|ZXUCxTY8aa	Your mum should WANT you to have a mobile phone..    Does she not care where you are when your out? Does she not rather you had a way to contant her in an emergency? Does she not want her own child to have something to phone the police, ambulance or fire brigade if worst comes to worst?    Your mother has got some serious thinking to do. And at $20 .. what is that? Most mobiles cost around 100 ... Perhpas your mum is getting you it as a surprise, really your mum must have something wrong in her head if she lets her 11 year old kid go out without a mobile!|`|iIPWOhdnaa	Your parents will be able to give you more freedoms cause they'll be abel to get ahold of you at all times.|`|NqhUm0yOaa	you are places where your parents are right so if there is an emergency how will you let your parents know cell phone!!! plus its only 10 cents a minute tell your mom you will do extra chores

mjWi7zvoaa	It sounds like you might have a defective phone. Every phone purchased from AT&T has a one year manufacturers warranty on it. All you need to do is call 1-800-801-1101 from a phone other than your cell phone and tell them what type of problems you are having. You will need to have your cell phone with you when you do this because they will need information from the phone. Also if you are not the account holder or authorized on the account, you will have to have the account holder call in for you otherwise they will not be able to speak to you. They will send you out a phone before you have to send yours in to them, so you wont be without a phone. Hope this helps :)

From personal experience, the Blackjack II is an amazing phone. If you are someone who is one the go and constantly checks emails, outlook contacts, and uses the internet, this is the phone for you. With Microsoft Mobile v6.1 (which I think is the newest version) they have eliminated a lot of the kinks that it used to have. It also has a very well put together menu and is quite east to navigate. On top of that, the qwerty keyboard is incredibly easy to operate. The phone is also quite sleek looking and comes in a few colors. I have personally tried out all three of those phones and the BJII is the way to go.  Hope this helps.

0ZjoSez4aa	you might want to check it out.  it's suppose to charge. the memory card has nothing to do with the phone being charged, now if the battery isnt there then thats another story.    it should charge i just tried it with mine and it still charges, maybe you need a new charger. they're very delicate.    hope i helped :)
CS4MVhsfaa	Well, nail polish remover contains acetone which disolves dried crazy glue.    Make sure to test on a small spot first.    I don't knw whether or not the remover will damage the screen.    Let me know if this works.    John H|`|ovgxECKsaa	Nail polish remover and a cotton ball or q-tip.  The nail polish remover will dissolve the glue.  Use a cotton ball or q-tip dipped in the remover to swab the glue until it is gone.  May take several minutes to get it all.  And it should not harm the screen but may remove any paint-like finish from the phone so be careful to only swab the glue itself.

DkSv6OZzaa	Well there are pro's and con's for each lol...Homebrew is free, and can do virtually the same as a chip, but you have to worry about updates when playing online and it still has alot of bugs that haven't been worked out on most homebrew apps....(The only way you will mess up your wii with homebrew is by installing another regions firmware i.e. say you have 3.2U and you install 3.3J your wii will brick, but it is fixable, just downgrade...     the chip, you don't have to install yourself, for about 60 dollars you can get one professionally installed for you, and its just plug and play for back up and burned copies of games instead of having to go through homebrew and back up launchers which don't work all the time...    It's all a matter of personal opinion really, b/c both do the same things really...me personally I have the Homebrew Channel, but am planning on getting a chip soon...|`|elOeLQTpaa	I used the twilight hack to get the homebrew channel and haven't had any problems since. Works like a charm.    Plus, opening up the hardware can get messy and is way more risky.
CKRfaRYvaa	If you have a single plan, then it is $20.00 for unlimited texting to any carrier.  If you have a family share plan, it is $30.00 added to the primary line, but it covers all of the lines on the share plan.

l2mJxB1Caa	all you have to do is call verizon customer service. they have the ability to reset the pincode. have you tried the last four digits of your phone number? that is usually the default. maybe she was mistaken when she said she set it. i truly hope that helps.

Upbgufvuaa	at&t, t-mobile and altell have the best phones, but cricket has the best plans available|`|XuK5CAQ2aa	I love T-Mobile phones, but I can't really give you a real opinion on that cause I use ATT. ATT is pretty good though. :-)|`|zkCH7PN5aa	verizon is the largest carrier in the us now since they bought alltel.    Id say Verizon does, they have many very basic phones, many high end phones, and lots of texting phones too.     They have a lot of diversity and different phones.     They lag some in the smart phone area though. They are slow usually coming out with smart phones.     Heres a link to Verizon phones.  http://www.verizonwireless.com/b2c/store...    Go to Cnet.com for reviews of phones i suggest.    Verizon is proly going to get even more phones with alltel. Im sure some of the popular phones there like the glimmer will come over. Verizon also has the best and most developed 3G network.    Verizon can be really stupid about some things though but im sure they all have their areas where its irritating.    Dont fall for the iphone, i dont like it, it misses so many basic features free phones have, it doesnt even have multimedia messaging! plus to have it for 2 years it costs about 2000 dollars.|`|QVC6sxtJaa	at&t|`|pjbdDi2Oaa	at&t has the iphone, and that is the best phone. There are SOOOOOOOO many applications you can get on it for FREE. Seriously anything you can think of from where to eat dinner that night and find the cheapest gas to medical dictionaries. It is the best bang for your buck for sure.|`|Qr7EiDo8aa	alltel is now verizon and verizon does I have been with all other providers before and they kind of are crappy phones
