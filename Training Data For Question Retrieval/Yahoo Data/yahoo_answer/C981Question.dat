Also who remembers Ronaldo's (not C Ronaldo) hatrick against them at Old Trafford a few years back?      Then again United are awesome in the EPL and of course they destroyed Roma 7-1.

"According to the newspaper, Pujols confirmed he was not in the dugout at the time the NL loaded the bases in the ninth; he said he was in the clubhouse having treatment on a balky hamstring but available to bat if called on."    This is in response to the numerous people who said that he was in the dugout in the ninth ready to go in this situation in my question earlier about who to blame - Pujols or LaRussa for Pujols not batting in the situation.    And again, Chris Russo reported earlier that he had several reputable sources tell him that Pujols had gone into the locker room and changed out of his uniform in the 9th inning, frustrated that he did not get a chance to play.  LaRussa covered it up by saying he was saving him for extra innings, which made no sense whatsoever.  But that's the real reason why Pujols did not pinch hit.

20090205105803AAXkCvm	Sports;Hockey	Fighting in hockey (NOT a rant)?	I looked for the article for a few minutes, and I'll add it later if I find it...      But they are thinking about forcing players to wear their helmets during fights.  What are your opinions on this?        I think in a way it is a good idea--more protection, less serious injuries.  But in another way it is a stupid idea...what about players that have visors on their helmets?  There are players with visors that get into fights, and this would be a very idiotic advantage.  The rule would be that the refs have to step in if a player takes off a helmet.      I don't know, it seems like it would be overall a bad thing.  Thoughts?

I've done some research, but I know very little on this subject and I can't decide.

I plan to visit and explain my situation, see what they say, and then take their 2 free trial classes.

20090202195951AAakvrY	Sports;Basketball	Great win tonight for the Lakers, but can they beat the Celtics on Thursday?	If Kobe have another night like this one, I have no doubt they will, but nights like this are rare, that's why they are special.      So who on the Lakers will step up beside Kobe on Thursday? I think Gasol will be fired up because he has something to prove, but the X-factor is Odom, he can create so many matchup problems for the Celtics if he is aggressive.       Also with the Celtics losing Posey and Lakers gaining Ariza, we are in a better position to defend Pierce while they are one good defender short on Kobe.      So what do you guys think??

So to all of those who are having a big laugh when Federer is in the dumps, then I ask you this....    Do you say that you never cry - in your life. You never let your emotions run weather your happy, sad, depressed? You have never shouted to the whole world just how you feel??

He's constantly shouting at them telling them when they can stop competing for the ball. Everytime something exciting looks like it's about to happen the referee blows his whistle and stops the game. Can exciting things only happen in rugby after an infringement?      Why can the referee keep out of it?  With less interference it might be worth watching. It's a game bogged down by the slightest detail. The referee seems to be looking for reasons to break up the flow of the game.

20090203043055AAnR9Bh	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Why do liberals in Congress lie about our guns?	A folding stock makes a rifle concealable, as if it were a pocket knife. But anyone who knows anything about gun laws knows that federal law requires a rifle to be 26 inches long, regardless of its stock, and a 26-inch-long rifle is not concealable.    A pistol grip is designed to allow a rifle to be fired "from the hip."  But the 90 million pistols owned by the American people all have pistol grips, and they aren't designed to be fired "from the hip." Besides that, the fact that a rifle has a shoulder stock and sights mounted on the barrel proves that it is designed to be fired from the shoulder.    Magazines designed to hold more than 10 rounds are not useful for self-defense.  If they really believe that, let them propose to prohibit the military and police from having pistol magazines that hold 12, 15, and 17 rounds.    These guns are "high-powered."  Next time an anti-gunner calls a gun "high-powered," ask him to name one gun that is low-powered. They even call .22 rimfires "high-powered," when they want to brand a .22 as a so-called "assault weapon."

20090219122553AA5lteY	Sports;Football (American)	Do you find it silly that some Steelers fans are giving Rothlisberger too much credit for Super Bowl victory?	As a steelers fan I am glad that they won however I find it silly that some fans think he is as good as manning, brees, rivers, or warner.  The fact is that while he played a solid qb it was santana holmes great performance and the defensive play especially harisson 100-yard int touchdown run that won the game for them.  Ben failed to score a touchdown in the first red zone drives in quarter 1 and quarter 3.  He also played poorly in their first two drives in the 4th quarter.  And while he did complete a td pass it was holmes great athletism and hands that made a catch that 75% of receivers would not have been able to make.
