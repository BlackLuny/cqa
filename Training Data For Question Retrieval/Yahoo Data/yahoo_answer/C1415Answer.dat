4Vswcoqeaa	Perspective is very important.  Every person's reality is based on perspective.  The more wide one's perspective is, the closer their personal reality corresponds with the ultimate reality of this great world.<br>  <br>  Traveling, seeing new things and interacting with different people can give you a lot of data about the world.  More data means better insight into what one should do with themselves.<br>  <br>  The whole world is connected.  If you spend all your time in a small town talking to the same people, each action you make isn't looking at the big picture.  If you spend some time in the cities and travel to other countries, you may realise that what you once thought was wrong, really isn't.  On the other hand, what may be acceptable in your hometown is frowned upon be the greater world community.<br>  <br>  If you meet new people and really listen to them, you will have a deeper insight into the human mind and be less quick to judge and to dismiss potentially valuable allies.|`|ewybA08Iaa	Boy, good question.   For me, perspective is influenced by cultural values, education, socialization, religious affiliation, and is an ever changing opinion of the sum of our individual experiences.

92yiQo7uaa	My mom began to talk about her father (who was deceased at the time) who had been a part time artist saying that he was painting in her hospital room where she lay dying. She spoke of her mother and sister visiting her in her room and they both were deceased. She became irritated when I asked what all of her deceased relatives were doing when to her it was as plain as day. She said her dad (my grandfather) was painting a canvas and said it like she couldn't believe I even asked the question.<br>  <br>  I think when it is time that those closest to us come to greet us in the process of going to the other side.<br>  <br>  I contacted a psychic, George Anderson (he has a website and has written many successful books on the afterlife)-he said that those on the other side where preparing for my Uncle Eddie as his time was drawing near. Eddie had been seriously ill for a long time so I found this amazing. Within a year Uncle Eddie was gone.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I think this is true, they do see loved ones who have crossed over before they die.  It may also be her way of letting you know it is her time, and she is ready.  She may be trying to get your assurance that you are o.k. with her passing when the time comes.

W2pvqhbkaa	You have been brain washed to determine what a person should look like.<br>  <br>  For you to assume you know what the correct weight for another person to be is making conclusions without having any of the facts.<br>  <br>  So with out ever seeing you I will call you fatty just the same as one person calling another fatty without any idea what that persons ideal weight should be. <br>  <br>  I have also noticed that when a person is put on medications it can cause a person to balloon and look fat.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	No, it's just mean. Well, for some people. If someone called me 'fatty' I would giggle, because well, I am a little chunky, but I find the word 'loveable'. But for other people who are way sensitive about their weight and have or are making great efforts to lose it, then it's a mean thing to say.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	No it is not, just as throwing a brick at someone would not be considered swimming.

mSaRuowKaa	I think this is a hard question. My knee jerk reaction was "Probably somewhere in the Arab World" but that's only because there is a lot of obvious oppression of women in those countries. To be anti-feminist I think you have to have an idea of what feminism is and, if you wish to do so, identify yourself as anti-feminist based on those grounds rather than simply being against equal rights for women. <br>  <br>  Put like that I can't really imagine that those countries are the most anti-feminist because I think they have the weakest grasp on feminism theory and so instead would be better described as countries in which feminism is least likely to develop or countries which oppose equal rights for women the most. <br>  <br>  If we're to decide which country is the most anti-feminist (IMO a pointless excercise in pigeon-holing) then I would guess that it is somewhere that feminism already exists.|`|2UnjeOQUaa	Because of the religious beliefs the Muslim and Islamic countries are very anti-feminist.

Only because North Korea has such terrible human rights for everyone... women, men and children... everyone. People there live in a constant state of fear. The North Korean government is so corrupt that people are starving to death, and what food they get in foreign aid the government squanders away. The country is completely isolated and no one really knows how bad human rights are there, but from what pieces of evidence we get from defectors it's a place where everyone is fearful and most people are hungry.<br>  <br>  There aren't that many countries where the quality of life is low for women and it isn't for men and children. In countries like that the quality of life is low for everyone. Women are oppressed in Saudi Arabia and Iran, there are places where women are very oppressed from a Western point of view. I think any country that practices Sharia Law is a place where women are oppressed.<br>  <br>  My favorite country? I don't have a favorite country.|`|1168bcccfff6f3a578ef3a0223e4cce5aa	Ahh.. the counter question! I just answered one on which is the most feminist. Fair play - it's always good to see balance.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's really possible to choose one - there are still many countries where feminism has little, or no, influence and as such it has much work to do and (in my opinion) a big shift in resources from feminism is needed to fight these things where they are worse. I'm not saying feminists in the west should pack up shop now, all I'm saying is a guy objectifying you when walk down the street is not as bad as women being stoned to death for being raped! A little perspective is needed. <br>  To hazard a guess I'd probably say anywhere in the middle east and communist nations. Places like China and North Korea are probably most under reported, because of all the attention on the general state of their human rights record. Once all this is sorted and dies down I expect we'll see some right old horror stories coming out of there!|`|Olz3goEaaa	Probably some place in the middle east you've never heard of (because they are one of the few with no oil to rip off) and that no pays attention to.

7ebCzedvaa	Almost absolutely.  There are signs of it everywhere.  Indian English speakers often have British accent, which can be interpreted as a sign of British cultural superiority.  Brazilian billboards sometimes have English words that would be jibberish to a native English speaker but signify superiority to natives there. The scale in which one culture dominates the periphery nations is often massive.  For example, the dominance of the English language, could unnoticed as cultural dominance.|`|MfcTIdlraa	Unfortunately, it does.  When the Brits landed lo these hundreds of years ago, they didn't understand the language or the customs of the native americans.  Therefore, it was necessary for them to change everything about the "savages" to the English way.  <br>  The Brits bastardized names of tribes, lands, rivers, mountains, and anything else that was unfamiliar to them.  The natives' were not educated according to the new people, so everyone had to be bilingual and had to read and write English.<br>  The peoplle from Great Britain, as a whole, just can't seem to leave other people alone.  They act superior to everyone else, and frankly it embarasses the Hell out of me since I am 2nd generation American from England!|`|lijNJznEaa	(In Posh Upper Class Accent) What was that, Old Bean, I can't make head or tail of what you mean, and all that. please tell us. <br>  What ho and all that Old Bean!!|`|pMtMsbBnaa	If you are simply referring to the idea of different social classes, then yes...I think that's always existed in any culture and always will.

You truly need to kick yourself in the butt like I've been doing lately (just not right now lol) take a deep breath, and do your work. Try and split it up so your not doing piles every day, like work on a big project a little bit every day.

When was the last time you hear a married woman say " I wish my husband would talk to me less"?<br>  Men aren't talkers/chatters etc.  But they do tend to talk more at the begining of a relationship when they are trying to win you over.

The thing you have to remember, is that boyfriends won't talk to you like your girly friends will. As a guy I don't want to share 'how i'm feeling' or 'whats going on with me' with a girlfriend. You can be with someone and love them without knowing what's on their mind 24/7. If he wants to open up, he will. It doesn't mean he loves you any less.|`|3d2dbfe624a4971313c2e9183de21b00aa	sounds to me he was raised differently with compaision!  <br>  also sounds like your friend needs to talk to him about it! as it seems to bug her! <br>  I can't fix it no words can fix it only her words to him and proper communication!|`|AA10712251	When he is looking into her eyes he's watching the goldfish swim around in her head.

Fsq9qvkqaa	It sounds like you have pent up anger and sadness that you want to release very badly, but you are afraid of the reactions of other people and what they will think of you. You don't want to come across as being weak by letting your emotions show.<br>  By punching walls and doors, you are releasing your anger. But once you go to face the people that you are angry with, you find yourself unable to hit them like you hit the walls, which means that you also don't want to hurt or burden anyone by speaking your mind about whatever is bothering you.<br>  Hope this helps :]|`|Khwt4oL6aa	To dream that you are punching someone or something, represents hidden anger and aggression. It may also be a symbol of power and your ability to draw strength from within yourself.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are feeling much anger, forewarns that you will be involved in a  terrible and tense situation. Your loved ones will let your down and disappoint you. It also forewarns that once solid ties will be broken. Being angry in your dream may have been carried over from your waking life. In your dream, you may have a safe outlet to express such emotions.

It exists on many levels-a person can love a child, a pet, pizza, etc. Speaking of "love" between a person and his/her partner of choice, I think societal expectations have much to do with it. Society in general has been brainwashed to believe that "love" in this case must be between a man and a woman, and they should establish some sort of legal agreement between themselves, or the whole relationship is invalidated. Religion has much to do with society's opinions regarding choice of partners and relationships, and racism and sexism also contribute.

urs7M4ITaa	Aww hunni, I am soo sorry to hear about this, sounds awful. When we are thinking about something a lot in our waking life, we tend to dream a lot about them too. Your mind works overtime and overlaps into your dreams. All your thoughts and wishes about this guy in reality are coming through into your dreams. So it probably just means that you wish he was still here, that he was still coming to see you. By the way, if you are having a lot of trouble dealing with this and want someone to talk to you could think about going to see someone about it. Because if you are having trouble grieving then just talking it out with somone could really help, and also help these dreams to resolve themselves as your issues become resolved.

Khwt4oL6aa	To see a baby in your dream, signifies innocence, warmth and new beginnings.  Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure, vulnerable, helpless and/or uncorrupted. If you find a baby in your dream, then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential. If you dream that you forgot you had a baby, then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities; You do not want to let others know of your weaknesses.<br>  <br>  To dream of an extremely small baby, symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence. You may be afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands.<br>  **************************************...<br>  To see a marriage in your dream, signifies commitment, harmony or transitional period. You are undergoing an important developmental phase in your life.  The dream may also represent the unification of formerly separate or opposite aspects of yourself.

Alternatively, the dream may be highlighting you innocence, purity, simplicity, and carefree attitude.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are watching children but they do not know you are there, is a metaphor for some hidden knowledge or some latent talent which you have failed to recognize.<br>  **************************************...<br>  If you are female and dream that you see a boy, then it indicates that you are developing the masculine aspects of character. Alternatively, it may represent your feelings about a real-life boy who is important and significant to you.

If some guy approaches you, or notices you at all,  it means he finds you attractive.<br>  <br>  It has been said that "Feminism was invented by ugly chicks".  I don't think that is fair or accurate; it ignores some very real problems like sexual blackmail in the workplace, unfair pay practices, outright discrimination etc.  <br>  <br>  That being said, on the level you are discussing, outside of the workplace and in a strictly social environment, there is a little bit of truth in the statement. There is nothing wrong with being pretty or wanting to look your best, or even being proud of looking good. (It takes a LOT of work to look really good. I used to be buddies with a Miss America Candidate, and BOY did she work hard!) and there is nothing wrong in being happy people notice that you look good, even if they don't communicate that to you in the most polite or sophisticated way.<br>  <br>  Taking pride in looking good, and defining yourself and your self worth by how you look are to totally different things.

For some reason, this kind of person likes the attention. It does not mean she is a slut or anything....though sometimes yes. And it does not always mean the girl does not like herself, but that there IS an insecurity present somewhere which makes the catcall a good thing to her. I don't think a woman should be bothered by it though unless it is aggressive. Most of the time, unless you're looking for a mate, it's best ignored. However, I would not like to date or even be flattered by someone making such calls because they usually get around, as guys like this certainly are not shy in approach, and probably do this a lot. I want a guy to like me for who I am, and he needs to know me to really be able to do that. A cat call just shows he likes what he sees...which is probably every other girl because he is horny, or the girl appears easy to him. I won't be offended by thumbs down because I know these people are probably guilty of one or the other of these behaviors themselves...denial always makes things okay and normal, right? And I smile with all my confidence. I don't need catcalls, just my husband by my side who has been the most respectful man I have met. <br>  <br>  <br>  To Hoo Ha! I am not referring to her directly but to women in general. Please do not get confidence confused with self-absorbed. I do not consider myself beautiful/hot or ugly or anything but happy. I accept who I am and if that is self-absorbed then I guess having low self-esteem is the healthy way to go?!  I can easily make judgments and comments on the seeker of this question based on her photo or what ever else I decide to go by, but that is not my place. I don't know her, you don't know her, and you don't know me but you want to put me down and comment on my mentality and self-esteem qualities. Interesting<br>  <br>  Just as you have attempted to, I gave my honest opinion without judgment directed toward the individual asking the question. My question was in general, was my honest opinion, and I am certainly not "full of it" nor insecure for providing it<br>  <br>  Hey hoo ha! you are being much more judgmental than I, and interestingly you are directing your answer to someone else's question at me. This is not about me. Why the eagerness to label me with negative remarks and defend a particular behavior? I could be judgmental myself and tell you why I think, but I won't go there. May I repeat that you do not know me and please do not think that you do.<br>  <br>  I have spoke my peace, and have provided my opinion as the question had asked. I am done|`|BGNdKvXzaa	It is not wrong to be unfazed by catcalls. You must be mentally strong.<br>  <br>  However, from my side of the table, my philosophy for the previous 30+ years is to speak only when spoken to, and to leave women alone.  If they are interested in you, they'll let you know.  Otherwise, forget it.<br>  <br>  Other than to try to ask for directions or something of that order, I have not approached a single women in the time-frame noted.

However, I've never understood why women get offended over a simple comment.  If you're not interested, tell him.  If he continues to do it, then I could see that being offensive too.<br>  <br>  Maybe I just see it different because I'm a man though.  Catcalls from women, while much less common, do occur occasionally, and usually come across as funny to me, like the 3 college girls who shouted at me to take my shirt off a few years ago, in broad daylight.  Even if I had done it (I didn't) they were long gone before they would've seen it, so I don't know why they shouted that.  At least in my experiences, catcalls aren't common, so maybe I just enjoy them when they come.  I've also never catcalled a woman before.<br>  <br>  *puts his feet on Julie's couch*|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	I think it shows attention seeking if the woman starts talking about it. For example, a friend of mine always spends the rest of her day telling everyone she meets if someone has hit on her. She just wants everyone to pay attention to her I think, because she wants the people she tells to agree that it's a shame she gets hassled for being so hot. She's a nice girl but she has a very low self-esteem and enjoys the attention. <br>  <br>  Personally, I don't pay any attention to catcalls or things like that, I don't really care... Look if you want, say something if you must. But don't expect me to listen or respond.|`|Madtpnoxaa	To Lizards- I don't think it's insecurity, she said is just doesn't bother her and sometimes it's flattering to her and she dresses fairly modest when she gets the attention to. I actually think it shows that she's cool and has a thick skin as well is not bothered by petty stuff and is secure as well as humility in my opinion, because she doesn't need the attention or try to get it, but doesn't get bothered and finds it nice sometimes. <br>  <br>  I think a woman who complains is a little self absorbed like they know they are hot and think guys are perverts for checking them out, some guys can be, but some women are a little too uptight and vain/and on their high horse to get upset, like what lizards said about a girl being a slut or insecure, I think a woman with her mentality is insecure and full of herself. Even if you are hot, you might as well enjoy compliments, because eventually your good looks and physical attractivness are going to be gone as you get old.<br>  <br>  I don't know her, but I believe what she said and I see from your answer that, maybe you are not self absorbed, but a little uptight and probably prudish, and you were the judgemental one in the first place. Your views from your answer sound quite conservative and traditional. It's not good for a woman to be a slut, but I don't believe a woman not minding attention is a slut, especially if she isn't going out of her way to get the attention from wearing very revealing clothes, but gets the attention simply because she is attractive.

5w1NQcXyaa	You are not saying much except that you are having chase dreams, so it will be up to you to interpret in terms of what is chasing you.   A chase dream is a common experience that usually speaks to the fears and/or anxieties of the dreamer, especially about that which the dreamer feels represents a loss of control.  Whatever chases the dreamer in the dream specifically provides clues as to the more exact nature of the perceived and/or actual threat in real life.  I think chase dreams represent ongoing frustration and anxiety issues that are experienced in real life; the dreamer experiences extreme loss of control or personal power, even some kind of actual harm beyond feeling such a threat, but for some reason the dreamer feels trapped by circumstances, wants to run and run, since the dreamer feels convinced nothing can stop the pursuer, and that confrontation is either too scary to think about or impossible due to reasons out of the dreamer's control.  <br>  <br>  In your own mind, go over your chase dream while awake, stop, confront the pursuer and have a conversation.  This will be very telling.<br>  <br>  One woman with an abusive older sibling dreamed repeatedly for years that her sister was chasing her without ceasing. This was due to the unsupportive family system that fostered the abuse and provided no protection for that woman who lived under constant seige as a child. She felt powerless to stop her sister and completely trapped and alone, and had no outlet to escape except in her dreams, where she just kept running and running. The dreams stopped when she grew up and put distance between herself and her abusive sister.|`|2nU8G5l9aa	I think chase dreams indicate your life in the rat race. It seems we're usually rushing to do things, having to meet deadlines, appointments, waking up to alarm clocks, looking at our watches, checking our schedules, avoiding the late payment on a bill, etc.<br>  <br>  For just about everything we do, there's a consequence if we don't do it right, or on time.<br>  Did I answer that fast enough?|`|8d8ejHPfaa	When something is chasing you in a dream, it basically symbolizes a problem or issue you keep running away from, something that you don't want to face and deal with.  Other symbols, such as the setting of the dream, what exactly is chasing you and things like that can also offer clues to what problem wants your attention...  <br>  <br>  If you have a recurring chase dream, try writing it down, and writing a journal entry for what was going on in your life for a few days before, when you start to have several of them together, you can start to compare them for what they have in common.  You may find a particular person or situation or a certain way that you react to thinks, or something in particular that's been on your mind keeps popping up in the journal entries.  <br>  Good luck...|`|8f23a4206101dec944da03ad28d56bc5aa	I looked that up awhile ago as I was having the same type of dream.

yl1HldKhaa	To see rats in your dream, signifies feelings of doubts, guilt and envy. You are feeling unworthy Something that you are keeping to yourself is eating you up inside. Alternatively, it denotes repulsion, decay, dirtiness, and even death. The dream may also be a pun on someone who is a rat. Are you feeling betrayed?<br>  <br>  To see a black rat, represents deceit and covert activities. <br>  <br>  To see a white rat in your dream, denotes that in your time of distress, you will receive assistance from an unexpected source.<br>  <br>  To dream that a rat is biting your feet, symbolizes the rat race that you are experiencing in your waking life.|`|5BBy6G36aa	I can't belive that the girl above me actually used a Dream translating site. That sounds like a bunch of crap.<br>  <br>  But anyways, about your dream.<br>  <br>  Usually when we have nightmares (dreams about things we fear), it's due to eating food before bed. The food is trying to digest while we sleep which keeps our mind awake. When we are sleeping, we have no control of how our mind thinks, and so it wanders.<br>  <br>  Maybe the girl above me could be right. (although I VERY highly doubt it)<br>  But Nightmares are usually caused by eating food before sleeping. You may not agree with this, but sometimes God gives us dreams. Sometimes they really can mean something. If you don't think that it was caused by food, then ask a church Pastor.<br>  <br>  As far as my interpretation for the dream goes:<br>  <br>  The black rat symbolizes some one, or something dark in your life that you need to get away from fast or it could come back to haunt you. maybe since it was hiding behind your computer desk then that means the problem is in your computer? Just try to think if you've downloaded any new music or became friends with somebody new.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, if you have the same dream again tonight, email me.

PCsW0gbPaa	I think it's because being Canadian carries some cache in developing countries, and that these Canadian men are probably rich by foreign standards.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's crazy to state that interesting, rich men have a wider selection of women that might be interested in marrying them.  So if I don't care about money, then my choices for a mate are going to be much better in a foreign country.<br>  <br>  So this becomes a pretty simple question.  Kind of like "why do people shop for produce at farmers' markets?"<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  I don't know about the whole "Why would a foreign woman marry a western man?".  Well, sure, if that's all you know about it.  But why not just "Why would a woman marry a man".  What if it's "Why would an old woman marry a young man?".  The question makes you assume the worst about people.  I'd guess that most of these men are genuinely seeking love.  A good share will be deceived by gold-diggers.  But they take the chance because here they are, an average Canadian schlub and they go overseas and can get the time of day from beautiful, talented, intelligent women with PhD or outstanding athletic or arts achievements.<br>  It's a little bit sad in a Great Gatsby kind of way, but I don't think there's any misogyny to it.|`|T6xd0OxWaa	I'm half Irish and am honestly thinking of moving to Ireland.

The man with the American/Canadian/Western European passport can pick and choose any woman he wants but it is all for money/a ticket out of their country.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I have family in Russia and I've witnessed about 8 or 9 people in my family marrying someone who they didn't realize was only marrying them for a visa. A few worked out but most did not. I've also seen it happen the other way around-- the man being from a foreign country and the woman being western.

Are they any better than you. 9 times out of 10 they are jealous and trying to get back at you because you have something or are the type of person that they want to be. Honestly do really have time for people like that? One great way to not be a target is to have the confidence to stand up to that person. Show them that they are not hurting you and that you find them somewhat pathetic. This is usually stop them in their track and rethink if they want to do it to you.

The silence and 'empty' listening is annoying, but as long as you see that her sort of help is not for you and move on - there are others out there, as well as what you believe yourself, to aid you along.

Last term I had a professor who threatened to fail me simply because I had never learned how to do something during high school.  He attributed it to a lack of motivation on my part and me trying to get by on excuses because of my problems.  They think there's something wrong with us, when it's actually that there's something wrong with them.  We look at the hard questions in life that they're not brave enough to face.  In some ways, we are far more sane than them.  We just don't fit into their cookie-cutter definitions of what an ideal student should be.  Suicide isn't a good option, though.  <br>  I'm very sensitive to what people tell me.  I don't have real friends.  I already know I'm going to spend my entire life alone.  However, I think that denying all those voices that tell you that your worthless, be they inside or outside, is the true victory in the situation.  And even when that seems impossible, even when it seems hopeless, I just pray and lie in bed and cry and wait for the next day, which is sometimes better and sometimes isn't.
AA11404742	Explaining all that happened in full would take more time than we have, and you'd learn enough to earn a college degree in economics.  But here's a short explanation:<br>  <br>  A few years ago, the rules used by some lenders for credit and lending were relaxed, and people could start to borrow more to buy a house.  So they did this, and the lenders started making more money.  Other lenders saw this, and relaxed their rules, and they made money, too.  This snowballed, until you got to the point where you could borrow more than the house was worth, with little or no money down, and the lenders would take your statements of how much you earned without actually even checking to see if you made that much money.  Also, many lenders issued loans with adjustable interest rates.  That is, you might pay only 4% the first year, but the 2nd year you'd pay 6% interest, and maybe 8% the next.  This meant that their mortgage payment could climb higher and higher.<br>  <br>  During all this time, demand was driving the prices of houses higher and higher, so that people were building equity in their houses quickly.  (Equity is the part of the house or property that they actually own.  If a house and lot it's on are worth $100,000, and you owe $80,000, you have $20,000 equity).  And as long as the borrower had equity, it was assumed that they wouldn't default, because they would lose their equity.<br>  <br>  Well, this bubble burst.  Some people who overstated their income couldn't make the payments, especially as those adjustable rate mortgages racheted higher and higher.  So they defaulted.  This had people looking around, and realizing that there were a LOT of these defaults coming, and so they better tighten their lending rules, and stop lending so frivolously.  Suddenly, it was very hard to get credit, and this really hurt people and businesses that depend on it.  If you own a business that makes designer dog houses, and you can't borrow money to buy materials, you can't make dog houses any more.  So add to this mess I've just described the fact that some people are losing their jobs.

AA10779574	Since the idea of what "positive" really is is a culturally determined issue, I guess that if a person sees globalization as some sort of hegemonic battle between cultures where economically weaker cultures are overtaken by more powerful ones, and if that person is a member of an economically stronger culture, they may see many positive effects of globalization on culture. As someone has said, history is written by the victors.<br>     I'm not sure that I see globalization as such an epic struggle, but the question of what positive means is critical. In an addendum to the previous answerer's contribution which I respectfully appreciate, a more accurate appraisal is that the rich have been getting WAY richer, while the poor have been experiencing positive, but not terribly large, gains.<br>  <br>  Peace and Best Regards|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	Globalization should have made us more conscious and tolerant of other's life styles and beliefs. It looks like the opposite may be happening. It should reduce the economic difference between the haves and the have nots. I'm seeing the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. I don't think globalization is working out in actual practice.

The dream may highlight your difficulties with accepting these changes. It is also indicative of how you can no longer tolerate or put up with a particular situation, relationship, or person. The stomach is often seen as the center of emotions.<br>  <br>  To dream that you have a rash, indicates repressed anger, frustrations and annoyances. You may be holding in your anger and frustrations and not revealing your negative feelings to others.<br>  <br>  To dream that you are in pain, signifies that you are being too hard on yourself, especially if a situation was out of your control. It may also be a true reflection of real pain that exists somewhere in your body. Dreams can reveal and warn about health problems. Consider where the pain is for additional significance. If the pain is in your neck, then the dream may be a metaphor that you are literally being a "pain in the neck".<br>  <br>  To dream that you have tattoos, represent individuality and the desire to stand out in a crowd. You want to be unique and different from everybody else, particularly if you do not have any tattoos in real life. Consider also what the tattoo is. Alternatively, to dream that you have a tattoo, suggests that a waking situation or decision is having a much longer lasting effect that you had expected.

q3tIt6htaa	To dream that your mate, spouse, or significant other is cheating on you, indicates your fears of being abandoned. You may feel some lack of attention in the relationship. A lot of times people with trust issues have been cheated on in previous relationships so it's not hard to understand why they fear that it will happen again. Many dreams come from the private unconscious and are a reflection on thoughts, fears, desires, issues or are a response to stressful or anxiety provoking situations. At times people have dreams about cheating on their partners as a response to a long and monogamous relationship. I personally wouldn't bring it up but if you must have to i would ask Hey i had this dream about you cheating on me and it really scared me...

I don't think there is any example of him using magical words, of course, events that seem magical, such as virgin birth, are not stated by him. There is the teaching of Peter to walk on water but that was to done by faith, which while some claim that to be magic, can also be said to be the will of a person to think outside the box or outside the illusions of life.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06592a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06592a.h...</a>

OdoLSDlXaa	It is not cut and dry.  There is some truth but he is not entirely accurate.<br>  Research has supported that many factors are highly influenced by genetic predisposition.  The controlled world he speaks of does not, and likely will never, exist.  But even if he could determine career, there is a huge variety and range of personalities within those careers.  Some would be happy and successful and others would be miserable or lousy at their career.  Some would be clearly not a good fit because of the inherited tendencies towards other interests.  <br>  <br>  It's more accurate to say there is about a 60/40 split between the influence of environment and biology (nurture and nature).|`|yBoRU10Paa	He is saying that when a child is brought up under the appropriate conditions which are conducive to learning and self-improvement, that child is capable of ultimately becoming a member of nearly any profession when he becomes an adult.<br>  <br>  It's true.  External influences are what shape us positively or negatively, and ultimately inhibit our growth in certain areas.|`|keKyarVbaa	Disagree - Watson is ignoring the effects of genetics in favour of learning.<br>  <br>  Studies of twins raised apart have found that they often have behavioural traits in common - approx 50% of individual differences are said to be down to genes.|`|4Vswcoqeaa	I agree.  Nurture over nature.  Every (well-formed) human being has the potential to become any of those things.  Of course, I believe Watson was thinking quite highly of himself in his "fatherhood" abilities.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	I agree and disagree ; of course if you brain wash a child and force him to do what you want [ that include violence ] ; yes he will obey ; but if he is free to choose ; well no its not true|`|vHxauOyeaa	I agree that you would be able to do that ... it is suggesting that a child's mind is a blank slate. so even if it is eomething like robbing people all day, if the kid gets rewarded and has no exterior idea of morals he's going to want to do it more and more. <br>  <br>  We are naturally inclined towards some things, but a specific job title doesn't mean anything about what you are naturally capable of.
DsEEATKSaa	Perhaps you could solicit parents as participants. You could request that they complete the  Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach's instrument which is completed by the parents on behalf of their child) on their children and some other standard personality instrument (e.g., the MMPI) on themselves.

You did your best for her and her husband out of the kindness of your heart. <br>  Second, this is a no-win situation and when people are having marital difficulties they will have an effect on others; the closer you are and the more you try to help, the greater the risk that you will be hurt. <br>  <br>  You took this risk as a friend and when she is calmer she will realise how unfair she is being to lash out at you. <br>  <br>  In the meantime be reassured that you are a good person and many, many people have sustained "collateral damage" in the conflict of other couples' relationships.

Some guys think its soft. Thats why the girls say " i love you" and the guys go " yeah, me too"|`|r0Fho3CIaa	It could be that hes just quiet.....or it could be he thinks that theres no need to tell her if he misses her or what he feels.  Some men prefer not to disclose how they feel, much to the frustration of their partner....but it doesn't necessarily mean hes not interested in her.  But tbh, theres not enough to go on to say for sure.<br>  <br>  If hes an honest type of guy, then he'd tell her if there was an issue...otherwise he probably just assumes everythings fine.  Heck I've done that before.  <br>  <br>  But she should talk with him saying that she would like to know how he feels from time to time...its the least he could do really.  He can't be totally shut off can he?  otherwise hes just not putting enough effort into what they got.|`|mxkLLEeNaa	it probably just means that hes insecure, and scared to share his feelings with her, a lot of boys are like that. you should maybe get her to say to him that she wants to hear how he feels, it makes her happy.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	maybe the problem is the making love part...<br>  does he want to make love?<br>  she may be pushing him.<br>  <br>  <br>  if thats not it  then he is shy... <br>  my bf gets that way too but he makes himself say sweet things(:<br>  lol|`|zmkflyoWaa	I would just give it time. See how he is in a few months time.|`|6GmtcZteaa	It doesn't mean anything. If you want a better answer I would say he's a bit insecure, protective of his feelings, had bad past relationships, is afraid of rejection or finds difficulty expressing how he feels. Looking into the eyes is just a way of showing his admiration. Tell your friend, that it is better if she tries to comunicate with him better, on the emotional level. Perhaps they should cuddle more and do more interesting stuff together. Just tell her to stop worrying and analyzing him, because he'll probably think it's weird too.|`|87b6887f8f3651f24e111ac966c0f89daa	It's rare that people always say they miss you , he probably just isn't the kind of person who talks about it a lot it's nothing to worry about and doesn't mean anything. If he's looking into her eyes it sounds like he is respecting her and paying attention to her .
rM5Tofhwaa	Love is not instinctive.  Human beings are unlike animals in the way that they crave perfection.  Anything that follows mass culture the closest is what we would call perfection.  you seem to be following this rule because anything she does that does not follow the strict expectations of your culture is considered imperfect and you probably see it as not worthy of your acceptance.  She may always have the same feelings towards you, but you might misinterpret the expressing of those feelings.  My advice would be, if you crave perfection, than take animal instinct and try to openly ask her questions without fear of rejection, But if you want her only, than try to establish an intrinsic relationship in a manner that coincides with the culture she follows.

6GmtcZteaa	A person who gets addicted to something easily. And takes a normal day routine out of doing it. They somehow are able to fit that into their life easily and make it part of their way of living. Like for example you miss one class, and you suddenly like it and start thinking about more that one class. You become adapted to that thing easily, or also with locking the door behind you, some people cant stop doing it. No, you don't have to be addicted to something to have an addicted persoanlity, because everyone is addicted to something, one who isn't simply hasn't found out what he is addicted to yet.

bzt6WmBUaa	there's no easy way to say this but i think that they are a bit patronizing and the best thing to do is talk to someone, tell them how you feel you'll gain respect from the tutors if you stand up to them. don't let them push you around, your worth more than this. in my opinion college seems like a hard time but most people said it was the best time of their life. if you have any close friends you should meet up with them and tell them how you feel and maybe go out, get things off your chest, if you don't feel like doing that find something to do to keep your mind off things. please don't try to commit suicide it may seem like an easy way out and a good idea at the time, but think twice are you really going to throw your life away like that? what about your family, you love them right, don't hurt them.. please try be more positive and keep your chin up and don't forget have a word with your tutors, OH and about the ladies man thing - gain a bit of confidence and go for it, you never know, you might get quite far...<br>  hope i've helped, best wishes in all that you do - Rachael x|`|PFejQPb2aa	whats Patronizing meen?

If you feel that you are young the regeneration of your body cells takes place. You may at least attempt what your young mind wants you to do. <br>  On the contrary, if you start thinking that you are old, you start decaying. The mind tells the brain that you are old and where ever a repair is possible, this negative attitude will make it more worse. You will slowly die.

M8B2i69gaa	This is normal. You were just experimenting, almost everyone does it. If you like having sex, then have sex; If you don't, then don't. There's no shame in it.<br>  <br>  You seem religious, and if you are, you can go to confession and tell your priest. He will tell you what you can do from there.|`|AA10510845	We've all done things in our lives that we're not proud of, so you're not alone.  If the truth were known, some of the confessions would be quite shocking indeed.  My advice to you is to ask God's forgiveness, and vow to live a decent life and find your one and only.  You don't need to beat yourself up over these past experiences.  What's done is done, so go on with your life and forget about that part of it.  You can do it!  Good luck!|`|AA11770886	I do not know why you people have so much of confusion about sex. Sex is a biological necessity. There is no rule as to how you start your sex life. The social norms have made it obligatory to observe the rules of the Society and marriage. But my friend, I can bet almost 90% of the people do have sex prior to marriage. Prostitution is an accepted norm in a civilised society too; because, without it more crimes will generate. <br>  So what you have done is not a crime. This is a  known secret about almost 80 % of your friends also. So do not be embarassed. You are not homesexual that is why you did not like the two guys. So enjoy your heterosexuality. If you are god fearing and disciplied, try to have a girl friend and then you can have your life as normal. There is a basic rule. ' YOU MUST TELL ONLY THE TRUTH, BUT YOU NEED NOT TELL ALL THE TRUTH." Don't you worry you are normal and give up that feeling of guilt. You can live a happy life.|`|5ddd4386484c069cb057c57372828170aa	Try not to think it over so much.  What's done is done.<br>  Don't be so hard on yourself.<br>  And also, I don't see why you should tell other people.  Keep this personal information private.  I don't think you have "sinned", you are just exploring, but don't tell other people because they may not understand and may label you, and you don't need that.  I think sex will get better for you, once you do it with someone you feel comfortable with, and don't make a big deal in your head out of those experiences, you have not screwed up, unless you think you have.  Besudes, you don't know what similar "secrets" other people hide, or what awkward experiences they may have gone through, no matter how "normal" they may seem to you know.  Don't give it more space in your mind than it deserves.  And if you feel really unconfortable about it if the subject comes up, then make up some little lie.<br>  I think you are totally Ok, don't sweat about this stuff.|`|zTFBdBdSaa	Normally : give yourself some punishment, something difficult / not killing!/, then forgive yourself and enjoy your life. Pay the debt to your moral consciousness - or ask some priest what to do to release that feel of guilt.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,<br>  <br>  (ANS) Religion & God can NEVER fill the hole you feel inside. Drugs too won't fill up the hole either, well not permanently. The hole inside you is a wound i.e. this IS your wounded-ness. What is required here is healing and that can only be done by turning around and facing your wounded self. And that can only be done by allowing yourself to FEEL the horrible feelings to allow yourself to feel the pain of the wound. YES! I wont pretend its an easy process, its a hard path to follow I know I have been either and know directly some of what that's like.<br>  <br>  **Some people are more wounded in life than others, with some the wound is only small like a cut that heals over by itself. Other wounds go deeper and take much long to heal before a scab forms and with others the wound is so deep perhaps it can take many years. Just like physical wounds take varying lengths of time depending upon the depth of the wounding or how the wound was created in the first place.<br>  <br>  **we are talking inner wounds here, to other people they may not see or fully appreciate how wounded this person might be. Its not like external wounds in that sense but inner wounds are just as profound & painful truth be known.<br>  <br>  **Talking with close friends, or family, or some kind of confidant can help. Or counseling or therpay can also help the healing but its not a quick or easy path but the rewards are very worth the effort in the end.<br>  <br>  Kind Regards Ivan|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	What makes you think that Christ can't be trusted?  You can trust Christ, but you can't trust man or WOman.  Get your facts straight, cuz, before you bust hellll wide open.|`|AA11770886	You consider that you have only two options. 1. Trusting Christ. 2. Going to drugs. There is a serious problem. YOu do not want to trust Christ; which means that you do not have faith. And at the same time you do not thing that it is a good idea that you take drugs.  What made you think that they are alternatives? and who told you that without these two you will have a hole in your life? <br>  You lack mental strength. Mind is the greatest source of energy in the world. Faithlessness will make if more confusing. In a way, Faith consoles mind from going into inexplicable situations. When you are afraid of a power, superior to yourself, you try to discipline yourself. Just imagine that minute point in your heart which triggers the electric impulse to make your heart beat from the day you were born till the day that you die! If you do not know who or what invented that,  let your ignorance of it be a respect for it too; for convenience you can call it respect, fear or faith. <br>  You seem to have some aimlessness in your life. You have to built up moral strength.Try to find meaning for life. Life is a short span of time between birth and death. Learn to live it. But while doing so make sure that your usage of time is useful to you and to others so that they will remember that you existed. They say as a man you have to work enjoy and sleep.

God made everything for Himself, and is Life, so there are no substitutes that can fill an empty heart. Perhaps the reason(s) you think Jesus Christ can't be trusted, is/are:<br>  <br>  1. His answers to your problems didn't come when you wanted. God's timing isn't like ours, but He makes all things beautiful in His time, for his purpose. (Ecclesiastes 3:11). His ways are higher than puny man's (Isaiah 55:9).<br>  <br>  2. You didn't like His program, or you wanted to do your thing and still be a Christian. A child of God must not lean on or trust his or her understanding, but acknowledge Him in everything. Then God will direct the believer's path (Proverbs 3:5-7, Proverbs 28:25).<br>  <br>  3. You didn't continue in His Word, but got distracted,  doing other things. A committed relationship with Christ must be ongoing  and productive or the child of God will be rejected. It involves talking to Him daily, meditating on the Word of God every day, and striving to please Him. A relationship with the Lord affects other relationships. But if you remain in God's Word, and His Word remains in you, you can ask whatever you will, and it will be done (as long as His will isn't violated) (St. John 15:7; I John 5:14-15)<br>  <br>  God knows our hearts,our thoughts, and our potential. Our purpose for existing is to become like Him in character. I suggest you call upon God again for help, repent, and obey Him. Get involved at a local Bible-teaching church and make friends. I did the same, and the Lord pulled me out of bitterness, mental torment, despair, aimlessness, resentment, anger, and is still working in me. He'll fix whatever you're facing.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	You should think about why you lost your faith.

Now, seems to me that Christ doesn't directly tell any of us mere mortals what the deal is - we're all stuck relying on what other mere mortals tell us they think Christ said and did. So, maybe you should start by trying to figure out the trust thing: what went wrong, why it went wrong, and whether or not you want to try to fix it. If you want to really occupy your time, start to check out philosophers and religion: Aquinas is worth reading - or Kant and his Categorical imperative: you will find certain common threads, and can re-construct your faith/ethos: good stuff comes from somewhere - and that is awesome!|`|J1Uyp1iTaa	Christ can be trusted, You have to realize that He does things on his time, Not yours..

IWWZdZRpaa	I starred your question and I understand your point.<br>  Few people have children because of some innate biological urge.  To say that biology drives our desire to have children, that may be true, but to completely ignore the social spects of it causes a complete lack of logic in that argument.<br>  If we were to have children because it was a biological function few people would be childless and people wouldn't "wait until they are ready" to have children.  Men would do what they could to spread their seed because biologically, the more children you have the more likely you are to carry on your genes.<br>  I like your question.  It is complicated.  But yes, I agree, having children is one of the things people do to complete their lives.  People spend a lot of money forcing pregnancies their bodies don't want (IVF, sperm donation).|`|cc774c60052f19c55798c87460d2faa3aa	It's in our genes, it's every species biological imperative to procreate, to drive forward that species. People have a hard time articulating it, because of the very fact that it is so ingrained in our instinctual drives. It's no more "selfish" than the biological imperative to survive, and doing whatever it takes to survive, is selfish.|`|ibaLRXY2aa	I totally agree. The only way to have a child is to adopt a child who needs a home because you want him/her to have a better life than the one they have now.

When my husband and I have prayed and feel God's telling us it's time, I'll stop birth control and we'll have kids.  Hey, if God wants to bless me I'm not going to stop him!<br>  <br>  Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward. Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, so are the children of one's youth. How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate. Ps 127:3-5 (NAS)<br>  <br>  I know many families with mentally/physically handicapped kids who don't know how/can't express love.  Many of these children were born this way and yet the mothers decided not to abort them and love them unconditionally even thought they seem to get nothing in return.  These children also won't pass on the family name and genes, but the parents don't love them any less than their other kids.|`|paub5LZPaa	sheesh, joseph black, that's deep. <br>  no i do not think that birth is the act of selfishness because without birth society could not move on and now you're stuck with a dead planet with no human life forms. so why don't you start a campaign? "stop all birth!" i'm sure THAT would go down well.|`|uDEaQ4uXaa	It's an act of selfishness, yes.  But it's not the ultimate act of selfishness.  <br>  <br>  As to consent; the child also hasn't given its consent not to be born.

Faith that the world will be a place where you would want your child to grow up; faith that your child will turn out okay.  Of course we know that our children may grow up to be miserable; to be a criminal; to hate us.  But as you have pointed out, the future cannot be known.  So it is an act of faith that things will turn out well.    If you hate life or don't value life or don't believe that life is a gift, then why have a child.  If you love life, then what other reason do you need?|`|lPgwZzoWaa	I am pretty sure I had my first child for at least partially self serving reasons.  (I found that I really love children after working with them for a few years and thought I had a lot to offer as a mother)  The child I am carrying now is more for other people.  (I want my children to be raise with a few siblings)  If I could ask the child her/his self and see if s/he wanted to be born, I more than happily would!  I have a sister who wishes she had been aborted instead of living the life that she has had to live.  I desperately want my children to happy, constructive individuals, but I will love them no matter what.  I may not always agree with them on everything, but I will be there for them, in their best interests until they ask me not to be.  I see life as a gift because my mother could have aborted me (instead of giving me up for adoption) and I am so glad she didn't.  I also tried for eight years to have a child before I was succesful, so I know that WE do not choose if we have kids or not, G-d does.  My children are still small and have already brought so much to my life (and I pray, I to theirs).  If we show true love (not self serving love that is dependant on what they do) then our children will love us.  I think that the majority of people out there do not think of these things before they have children.  I think a lot more kids than we know are not planned, so their parents just don't have time to think it through.  And I think a lot of people just have kids because that is what is expected of them, they never stop to think though all of the ramifications.  I desperatly wish that people would stop having kids that they don't want, don't need, can't afford, and will never care about.  There are many wonderfully effective forms of birth control out there, USE THEM!!!!|`|iHKJsyfTaa	I am sooooo special ,, I want a little Xerox copy of me !<br>  <br>  After all I need someone to fill the void in my life,, to love me unconditionally  and take care of me when I'm old.|`|K4zsztkRaa	?Sure there’s a chance of everything happening, but that's not a reason to not have kids.<br>  <br>  If they grow up to be miserable that's their choice not mine, as a future psychologist I believe (and this has been proven), that people have control over their emotions for the most part, now if the kids had severe depression or something else going on I can't control that. But honestly if your average person is miserable it's not because of any of that it's just because they are miserable people.<br>  There is a chance that anything can happen to your child, but that's not an excuse not to have them.<br>  I have had depression before, I honestly would rather have had a life even if I was unhappy than to not have a life at all. <br>  <br>  I don't think there is such a thing as having a child that doesn't bring fulfillment into your life. I was an unexpected child; does that mean that I don't bring joy and fulfillment to my parents? No it doesn't, even if the child is unexspected he's still a blessing.<br>  Yeah I would, 50% of children do not pass on the family name, they are called daughters.<br>  Um I wouldn't refer to my child as an it, also the only reason my child would have not to love me is if I did something really bad, the love between a child and a parent is very strong and it would take something serious to happen to break that bond and I wouldn't let it so I don't have to worry about that.<br>  <br>  I don't think that having children is selfish. You give up a lot of yourself to be a parent and you sacrifice a lot of things to do that.<br>  <br>  Also I think it's immature to state that just because a child "might" be depressed later in life that's a reason not to give someone a chance at life. Like I said it's better to have a life and be sad than not have a life at all.<br>  <br>  It's very unselfish to have kids.<br>  I think the selfish thing to do is to abort the kid.<br>  <br>  A person has to give consent to something to make it happen. You are suggesting this future person (that doesn't exist yet) is a person and it's not. There is no person to give consent to being born and therefore no consent is needed because there is no person.<br>  <br>  -Connor|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Human beings, like all animals, are born with a need to reproduce.  Our nature is designed (or evolved) to have sex and thereby have babies.  We'd have to deny our every instinct not to have children.  Selfish, possibly.  But then everything we do is for selfish reasons.  We put clothes on because we don't want to get cold, we eat because we're hungry, we sleep because we're tired and we have sex because we want to.<br>  We all want unconditional love and that love comes usually only from close families.  We can divorce our partners, but our children are always there (except in very dysfunctional families).<br>  No one thinks their child will be a criminal.  That's not how it works.  Our children are born in love and hope.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Well, I'm pro-life, so by your logic I would argue that conception is the ultimate act of selfishness.  Especially if you think that you need the consent of a nonexistent being to create it.  That's quite the mind-f*ck.  Then by extension, sex is utterly selfish as you're always running some risk of conception.  Maybe you could just be celibate?  Just kidding.  No, you don't know that your child will have a good life, but you can try your best to provide that for them.  Likewise, I wouldn't consider it my child's job to bring fulfillment to my life.  Most people love their children no matter what they grow up to be like or how they ultimately hurt you.  Because no matter what, you'll always have the memories that you made caring for them when they were little and you were their whole world.  The people who can assume the risk that their children won't always behave as they want them to are the only ones who should be having children.  But you really can't do much to stop the rest from procreating.  Natural selection really doesn't care about your philosophical hangups.  Also, I think most people are grateful for their lives.  They may not always be happy, but the proportionally small percentage of suicides says that most don't want their lives taken away.  I know I don't|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Not one person said "I wanted to have a child so that he/she can experience all the wonderful things I have in my life."<br>  <br>  Maybe that's what they meant by, "I wanted to have one".  No one is obligated to list the reasons why they want kids.  <br>  <br>  I think it's only selfish if the person has no intentions of making sure that their kid has a good life, like making sure that their financial, emotional and physical security are in order.  If you have no money, no education and nothing to offer, yes, it is selfish to have kids.<br>  <br>  Ryde-On: I know SO many people that think that way!  Of course, you have the, "I got knocked up and don't feel like getting rid of the little bugger" types as well.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah I get your point, I think that sometimes. Very few other people seem to get it. It is selfish to create a person without asking and for a lot of people, this whole new person is there for THEM (even though they will be living a substantial part of their life with their parent dead)<br>  <br>  Honestly, the reason it happens is because it's a biological motivation to breed. So people think all sorts of reasons but that's just to rationalise their instinct.<br>  <br>  I have heard people say "I wanted to have a child so that he/she can experience all the wonderful things I have in my life." - I've seen it on the P&P section in this site. <br>  <br>  Harriet

It was very empowering to feel so on top of things.  I'd have papers finished several weeks ahead of schedule.  As a secondary bonus the papers were always well thought out and better written.  When I got them out of the way I could really enjoy the free time as there was nothing looming over my head anymore.

Most of the time though the care giver suffers more and can have serious health deterioration.  You already have enough of your own problems.  Look for help from friends or family members, maybe support groups.  Reach out in your community and who knows you may find more strength.  Maybe if you keep this one little bit of advise "She says hurtful things to push you away, so she can continue down her self distructive path.  You need to know that what she says and what is the truth are to vastly different things.  Get help for yourself, if your a spritual person then pull from that.

Don't let her pull you down be strong if you can.|`|iUzSlmSbaa	Well, as hard as this sounds, but according to the links I attached, the best way you can help her, without her getting upset and you having to deal with that as well..is to respect her wishes if she is an adult. You can't force feed her, whatever you do. You can only show her your love. A lot of teenagers who developed anorexia nervosa in their late teenage years could never stop and find their way back out of thinking in a normal way about food and their body, so it's better to not talk too much about it. If she eats some soup, that's better than nothing at all. One cannot force feed someone over any lenght of time. This is a mental disorder but she is sane and knows the consequences of not eating. If she was Bulemic, it would not be as noticeable but just as dangerous. Bulemic people often maintain a normal body weight but what they do to their bodies is equally as unhealthy.<br>  <br>  You have to take care of yourself.. you can't be strong for her, if you don't look after yourself. Anorexia is a very serious disorder and unfortunately it is very hard to cure this... she should really be in some kind of sanatorium.. not a hospital.. not locked up, but where she gets psychological help and gets councelling on a daily basis.. and someone who can help her to see her body the way it really is.. and not looking in the mirror and someone skinny is there looking back at her but she sees a fat person, even if she is thin.. her body can't cope with not eating.. her cells need nurishment to function.. if the body does not get sufficient nurishment, then it will weaken all her organs, that's why she should get professional help.. if her parents or someone .. a family member of hers.. is still alive.. they should help you cope with this.. they should support and encourage her to go away for treatment for 3 months or so.. that might help her if she has professionals taking care of her nutrition but don't treat her like a child. She won't be a prisoner there.. but she will learn about her body and what this disorder is doing to her.. before it's too late.. <br>  <br>  You need help from others.. her family would be a good choice, they must care about their daughter, niece, sister... she must have someone apart from you who cares enough that you can enlist their help..<br>  <br>  This reminds me so much of Karen Carpenter.. the singer of the 1970's and early 1980's.. she and her brother Richard were famous as the ''Carpenters'' and in her teenage years she developed anorexia.. she never got over it.. she had a powerful, wonderful voice, she looked healthy for a long time.. just slim but in the end she weighed maybe 75 lbs.. her heart failed.. she was in her early 30's that was tragic...so I hope that your GF can get help but you can't do this alone..  and people who are anorexic I am sure act unusual and are argumentative often... it's a mental disorder.. one that's hard to cure...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freedieting.com/eating_disorders_partners.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freedieting.com/eating_disord...</a><br>  <a href="http://caringonline.com/eatdis/helpothers.html" rel="nofollow">http://caringonline.com/eatdis/helpother...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Carpenter" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Carpe...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhkV6Q3Hsug" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhkV6Q3Hs...</a><br>  <br>  That's Karen's voice|`|mTwn8p79aa	Don't take this the wrong way, I'm only saying this because I think it's what you need to hear.  I think you both need someone who's stronger to be your partner.<br>  <br>  Someone with severe PTSD and someone with severe anorexia would make a lot better friends than they would a couple.  You both have severe emotional damage and need someone who is very strong to help you when you need help.

ZdAGJPlqaa	Has masculism destroyed feminism? If not then no.|`|T1n3jt6Zaa	No masculism is not generally agreed to remove shackles. The women's movement was the collective force of our mothers, sisters, daughters and others forcing the men in their life to acknowledge that women were humans and as such entitled to every right and freedom entitled to humans. Ask one of the women in your life to teach you the basic history of the oppressive nature men were ,and are still, documented of, in the fight against equal rights being extended to women.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I don't know that removing shackles that you put on someone makes you a savior.  I think it just makes you penitent.  Also, you're western-bias is a little unsettling.  There are plenty of non-western civilizations that function just fine.  In fact, research suggests that they're happier than North Americans and Western Europeans.  Just because parts of the world aren't blessed with the rampant consumerism that seems to be the hallmark of western society, doesn't mean that they are inferior.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	"Masculinism" is probably just as useful as cats protesting the control of mice.  C'mon.  There are many, many countries where men still rule things and women are beaten and raped without anyone coming to justice for it.  A woman in Saudi Arabia was arrested for wanting an abortion after being gang-raped by several men.  In some countries, gang rape is seen as a punishment for SOMEONE ELSE'S crimes.  For instance, if a boy commits a crime, his sister would be raped by several men.  So what 'masculinism issues' are you talking about?|`|c77cjTOeaa	Yes, "masculism has little, or no, influence" in the minds of educated people.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Gee, celtish, sounds like you've finally gotten into the whole sex-based, sex-biased game.<br>  <br>  "It is generally agreed that masculism has succeeded in removing the shackles from around femenist minds."

xcSCT8Ocaa	The best possible answer that i could give you is to try NOT to be so much like your friend and to try to be more comfortable in your own skin.  It seems as if the reason that your uncomfortable talking to people is insecurity, either with yourself or with the relationship between you and the person you're talking to or both. Maybe if you gain some confidence you would be able to talk to other people without feeling uncomfortable. hope i helped:)

Anyways! What I do is sing a song by my favorite band, Simple Plan. Its called "Shut Up" It makes me feel that even if I sucked and I sounded terrible, I tried my best and they could get over it if they had a problem. I don't know why but listening to music helps me relax. Eat a banana. I hear they relax you and even heal cramps lol. <br>  <br>  Really don't worry. If people have a problem with something about you they can get over it because you shouldn't change for anyone. Things will get better. They always do. They just fall into place eventually. My goal used to be to just make it through the school day without having a heart attack. Now I have a ton of friends and I don't get nervous about band or anything!<br>  <br>  I hope I helped at least a LITTLE. Hope it works out|`|klOP21xTaa	Go to college, it worked for me.|`|mTwn8p79aa	This is going to sound silly, but, new clothes.  Clothes really do make the man, especially in high school.<br>  <br>  If you're a girl, wear a little makeup, if you're a guy, actually do something with your hair.  Being popular isn't a big secret.  Just "fake it until you make it."<br>  <br>  Viki's got a point, right before she contradicts herself by confusing her sayings.  There's a big part of just acting cool, which also isn't all that hard.  If someone says something nasty to you, say something nasty that's a little clever back to them.  I used to go with something to the formula that followed you're stupid and I'm smart (sometimes something as simple as "You're an idiot.  Why on earth would I care what you have to say about anything, let alone fashion sense."  And then just walk away.)  Or maybe you're low class and I'm upper crust type of insult.  Basically they both hinge off of the "I'm so much more mature than you that I don't need anything to do with you."  They both do a great job of putting someone back in their place, especially if they started it.  <br>  <br>  Oh, and back to Viki's sayings, it's "play with fire and you'll get burned" or "fight fire with fire."  Combine them and you lose the meaning of both.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to anyone that says "don't change for someone else" or "just be yourself."  Fantastic advice for someone living in fantasyland but here we are in the real world.  Learning how to fit in with the rest of society is one of the most important aspects of school (and it's exactly why everyone can pick someone who was home schooled out of a crowd from a hundred feet away, they're missing this important skill.)  Frankly, it's probably the most valuable lesson you'll learn at this time in your life, here's some news, not many of us use geometry or calculus and no one will care if you got an A or a C in a particular class. But, if you're maladjusted, everyone will know and everyone will care.|`|WOcj8d5iaa	Well I was in the same boat in high school; I could be brought down very easily. The way I fixed it was by changing what I was about. Your feelings inside need to be reinforced, who are you? What do you like? What do you feel strongly about? If you don’t have anyone to look up to for support it could be a little rough, try to find out what morals you live by and stick to them, don’t let anyone push you around. If you want to be stronger you need to have a personal goal to look toward, what kind of person you want to be and follow it. Look at and bring out the good thing about yourself that you already have, you have to like yourself more than others have to like you : ).|`|EDNJaGAxaa	well, what are you like? are you nerdy? are you short? are you fat? are you ugly? are you shy?                   if your nerdy then you have to change, a lot. like new haircut new shoes new attitude walk with a swagger, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP, dont look at the ground when you walk!!            if your short then to make up for it you have to be outgoing and almost mean... but only until people think of you as cool               if your fat then ... your screwed unless you can lose wieght or intimidate people into not making fun of you                                   if your ugly.... idk you just have to deal                                      if your shy then become friends with just one girl that is kind of popular and youll quickly open up                                                                                                              <br>  oh yeah and what the other person said if you dont have a required uniform, then its about clothes, i have a uniform, thats why i said shoes lol  and thats the best saying ive ever heard.

There was marked controversy in the psychiatric community regarding the removal of homosexuality from the DSM. The data that had been gathered regarding homosexuality up to that point had almost always come from gay and lesbian participants who were in therapy. Therefore, some researchers believed that the data was inaccurate and that the emotional and social problems that had once been attributed to the state of being homosexual were not related to the participants' homosexuality but to other variables entirely. When data was collected on gays and lesbians who weren't in therapy, the emotional and social problems that were found to affect homosexuals in previous research were not seen.<br>  <br>  You see, for something to be considered a mental disorder, it has to be the source of some level of impairment and distress. We cannot simply classify mental and emotional states as disorders merely because they deviate from the norm.
YzoLa5Uuaa	This is a very, very vague question. The first thing you need to do is come up with something you are interested in and research that topic. Once you know what you are looking at, formulate  research question that can use the neurological measure of your choice (EEG can be a useful one if you have access to it and know how to use it properly). <br>  <br>  Face processing (N170 waves) and motor control (bereitschaftspotential and Motor Evoked Potentials) are two areas of neuropsychology that are popular with EEG.

At 16 your not advanced your a baby. Actual technology is made to increase progress of the human race in every possible aspects specially KNOWLEDGE. Knowledge / experiences / makes you aware of the world that surrounds you and will help you live a better life. You should focus on learning every day and never spend a day without learning or in 10 years you will be like : This is my life? Im the same and exact same as 10 years ago ? Will suck trust me. Unfortunetly you cannot go to the forest and live there and even then , when poeple were there what happened? They wanted to cross a river so they builded a bridge. they wanted to resist to rain/storms etc so they builded house they wanted to EAT so they builded a BOW. You would just rebuild the world as it is right now. You got to accept the world as it is right now , <br>  and my last word:<br>  We are limited due to our entity capacitys.

You're also antisocial.  I guess you could say it's psychological, but in a way it's also a flashback to the way things used to be.  However, your anachronistic tendencies are depriving you of the fun you should be having at this age.  You need friends and some sort of social life to be a well-rounded individual.  College is not just an extension of high school.  It's higher learning that will prepare you for a future, even if it is using torches instead of flashlights, and living in a teepee.  Even the primitive people had to learn their trade.  At 16, you have a long life ahead of you, and my guess is you'll change your priorities as you get older.  Don't be a total recluse.  Even if you'd rather rub two stones together to light a fire, you need to light one under yourself, figuratively speaking, that is.  So try to live in the times you're in, as much as possible.  Even a loner gets lonesome at times.  Good luck!|`|w8gBWpKTaa	Know what you mean man... things seem so fake and disguisting at times. There's so much of everything...... and at the same time it seems like nothing. It's like the worlds lost and going back to the stone age could wouldl help them find themselves. Or maybe. it would help YOU find yourself- and that's why you have these feelings, because you feel a bit lost amongst all the materialism and want to just take a step backwards, get in touch with yourself. <br>  College and high school are nothing but fouintains of useless knowledge, but the result of that knowledge is what gets you where you wanna be and you gotta bear that in mind.<br>  I don't think there's anything wrong with you, just that because your intelligent you probably overthink things a little too much and this never has a happy ending. Remember it's what you do that has an impact on your life, so go out and live it, with or without society on your side. We might not be able to time travel,  but going out for walks and sitting amongst nature can really give you that space you need to breathe and forget about modern day hassles.

2SgsPKF9aa	I happen to have the same situation where I work(Wal-Mart).These 2 people have been in charge of depts. and were both demoted because of their lack of discipline and their complete laziness and no-care attitude regarding things that are required to get done. They ave been warned and written up but never fired. When they are there, they are always together talking or on their cell phones or outside having a cigarette.The store manager has no b--ls to do anything ever but especially with them. They should have been fired a year ago.But why should they try when management allows them to do what they want even when almost the entire remainder of the staff in the building want them fired.It comes down to a very weak manager.Plain and simple.

rpnFxnCQaa	Sydnee,<br>  <br>  It seems you suffer from anxiety/agoraphobia. But you should really see a specialist to get that confirmed. Ok? And speak about it. That's therapy too.<br>  <br>  Now what I can tell you about anxiety ... <br>  I can relate to how you feel. I had anxiety attacks too. I was thinking too much. For me, that was when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a 100% natural method. <br>  If the doctor says you suffer from anxiety, try this:<br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a> but do not forget to talk to your parents about it first!<br>  <br>  The KEY of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  Not only did that program cure me - you can become your true self again - but I was also extremely surprised to even discover newly built self-confidence.<br>  <br>  There is always a solution! You have to treat is as soon as possible. You will be fine. Many people have been through that - I have.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Misaki|`|GXxC8CIfaa	hhhmmmm........

Dreams depend on every little detail. If there was a dot in the background it could change the whole meaning!<br>  <br>  Snakes represent lies, tricks and cruelness. In your waking life, is there somebody that you should trust a little less?<br>  <br>  Orange represents, on the other hand, kindness and outgoingness.<br>  <br>  To dream that you're being bitten represents that you are vulnerable due to some unsolved issues and obstacles in your waking life. It may also mean "you've bitten off more than you can chew."<br>  <br>  Basically, I believe the dream means that there's an unresolved issue in your life with a person. One of your "friends" may be kicking you while you're down while masking their cruelty with lies and fake kindness.<br>  <br>  Be careful of who you trust and good luck,<br>  Patty-san|`|ZgW0KacZaa	<a href="http://www.thecuriousdreamer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thecuriousdreamer.com/</a><br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  Are you afraid of snakes?

adQWVOeAaa	Ethnography is the method of researching a human society using the method of fieldwork. It is a holistic method that essentially researches a group as a whole. <br>  <br>  Since homosexuals are a group of people, I believe it would make sense. What would be more appropriate, however, would be your character studying a specific society of homosexuals... such as a gay community or something similar. <br>  <br>  I hope that made sense and good luck with your book!

Romans 6:23<br>  <br>  For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.<br>  <br>  Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20<br>  <br>  As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12<br>  <br>  Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19<br>  <br>  …that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that <br>  God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9<br>  <br>  If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.

uBX7R6xvaa	You may be into saving people or trying to bring more life out of them.  Often people will relate to others with the hope that one can pull out of them more of their unique talents or show them they have more potential.  That they have a lot of potential that they have not really tapped yet.  One may tend to encourages others to become more fully involved in life and more fully aware of what they have to offer.  One may hope to find a special type guy that may have a lot more to him that with some encouragement can come out.  <br>  <br>  Meditate/pray, do mind-body or other exercise(not excessively), and eat healthy so that you will have the spiritual strength and energy to inspire others in a positive way.

Although technically it is possible for information to be recovered/restored, in all honesty the people who are capable of this are *not* interested in your personal information--you are not wealthy enough to make it worth their while.<br>  <br>  The likelihood that your information is floating out there somewhere from that hard drive is extremely small.<br>  <br>  In the future, if you are going to throw out a hard drive then format it first.  If you are still concerned, then physically remove it from the hard drive, open the case, and expose the discs to open flames (you can use a match or lighter for this).|`|b919231cdc9dcf8edee5a210e4d7a40faa	I have OCD as well and I did the same thing as you about two years ago, after I got rid of it I thought to myself "yeahhh I should have wiped that drive" but the funny thing is the drive can be restored by anyone that knows what they're doing unless you do a "government wipe."

Life sucks and most everyone feels what you are feeling occasionally. Find something that you don't need anyone else for that makes you happy and indulge in that. I would suggest stop the cutting and suicide stuff because it will only lead to shrinks and drug and alcohol abuse which will lead to more shrinks and other sorts of trouble. If you want attention that is the completley wrong way to go because you lose respect and trust which will come into play as you get older. People will always need people to make fun of because it is funny and or to make themselves feel better about themselves. Do not take it personal because it truly is not meant to be personal. I gurantee you one day in those people's lives they will ask themselves why were they such an asshole and ***** to someone they really didn't know for no reason, and you will look back and be proud of yoruself for handeling the manner in a way that lead you to be a stronger person. Friends usually don't realize they are doing those things and don't forget they could have a little more in common and they will go through spurts of hanging out alot and then I am sure you and one of them will accidentally make the other frieend out of the loop.

Maybe it's a generational thing. It hasn't been too many years since I finished high school, and it was very common there. In fact I think the girls in that age group were more confident at initiating dating.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|SK6MZ66Maa	There are books written by men that advise women to not make the first move when looking for a suitable long-term mate (short-term dating/casual sex is fine). I guess it goes back to evolution and the unconscious (men enjoying the competition and the thrill of the chase, instead of having a woman chase them).  Women who do make the first move are said to disrupt a man's "evolutionary conscious" (no feeling of him conquering something). <br>  <br>  I personally don't care who makes the first move though, but people are conditioned to feel this way. I've seen some rude comments on yahoo made to women who make the first move.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Some women DO initiate.  I actually enjoy women coming over to me.  I don't like wasting my time.

As you call it courting I take it you are in your 50s or older so I doubt it was common then|`|ewybA08Iaa	OK, your statement is a pretty strong generalization, and each woman has her own response.  So, here is mine.  I do not look at guys continually, but do not look at a fellow continually. I admire a nice butt, good grooming, including shoes, clean fingernails, and presence.  I have asked guys to join me for dinner and or a movie, or to go clubbing, but not to necessarily have a sexual encounter.  I have a long term companion however, and even though I still appreciate the above attractions, I no longer seek a date.|`|8OREBeRdaa	I've wondered the same thing.  I've wondered if women prefer the advantage of being able to turn a guy down. <br>  <br>  I think that if women want equality then it's ok for them to initiate or go flirt with a guy.  It would certainly be a refreshing change and this is regardless of courting. <br>  <br>  I think guys do because it's expected and more traditional of a mindset.  I'm not trying to sound sexist - just my 2 bits.|`|mVUpt8waaa	Because traditionally women who approach men straightforward like that are seen as easy and not respectable.  It is a throwback to ancient customs.  So they all just prance and buzz around and hope that prince charming will notice them.|`|c77cjTOeaa	Many women (myself included) were trained to believe that female persons shouldn't assert themselves in ANY sphere of life.  We were taught that girls should be passive , not active.  Active pursuer = slag.|`|9TeE1K3Eaa	To shy, also society has taught us for many years that it is not lady like to make the moves on a man.

Even if people in my generation are supposed to forget these archaic gender roles that have come down through the milennia, the fact that younger girls are just inexperienced and insecure has to be considered.  This fact is probably why the younger ones aren't so straightforward.  I also noticed that women who are older are generally more receptive, opened and friendly.<br>  <br>  I think the social disorder known as feminism is an actual supremacist ideology which seems to put down a man as much as possible while uplifting women at our very expense.  I also find it funny how girls these days want to emulate so many aspects of men and take positions which were traditionally ours.  They want to be CEOs, Presidents, Lawyers, Doctors and so on.  I don't have too much of a problem with that, but when they try and say they're naturally better at doing these professions is when I outright disagree.  It's interesting that they're assertive in all of these positions, yet so many simply can't take the initiative when it comes to dating and relationships.  The modern world in the west is absurd!<br>  <br>  I also want to add that girls shouldn't be afraid of defying gender roles.  You shouldn't let society define everything for you, you should take some initiative for once.  Maybe it'll pay off grandly in the end.|`|foUPphu2aa	My girlfriend was the one who initiated our 'courting' (a term that hasn't been used since 1957).

For all the talk about women's rights, and equality, and that we have to get away from the traditionalist ideas of what is a man's job/woman's job, women are perfectly content to state that asking the opposite sex for a date is a guy's job.  <br>  <br>  There are even some bozos who go so far as to suggest that guys actually enjoy pursuing women--as if one can possibly make such a sweeping conclusion about an entire gender.  In their little female minds, there is no such thing as a guy who is shy or socially awkward.  <br>  <br>  It sucks being a guy because that means you have to do everything, because no matter how much a girl likes you, odds are she won't get off her backside to make any effort.  Or she'll play all kinds of games trying to get you to notice her, and drop subtle hints and such and expect you to be clairvoyant.  Anything other than being straightforward.  <br>  <br>  There are many exceptions to the rule of course and I have been fortunate to have been approached several times.  However most women seem to think every single guy ever born enjoys the nerve-wracking experience of approaching a woman.  I know I particularly enjoy the possibility of rejection.  Let's see, I'm approaching someone I find interesting and attractive, I make myself vulnerable by starting a conversation, I'm supposed to sing and dance and be witty and clever and pursue her, and work tirelessly to convince her why I'm good enough to spend money I don't have on her, simply because she had the good fortune to be born a woman, and when she says no I get to dwell on the fact that she'd rather be alone than go out with me for a few hours and get free alcoholic beverages/coffee/movie tix/flowers/chocolates, etc.  Yes that is truly an enjoyable experience.
DXXpHKupaa	Well, I instruct a class in marital arts and I can tell you that your best bet is to develop your mind and posture before you worry about your physical ability.<br>  <br>  Bullies target you primarily because you are an easy target.<br>  <br>  Conventional wisdom dictates (falsely) that it's all about how big you are.  Let me tell you that I've seen and heard of larger, stronger people getting mugged and attacked.<br>  <br>  Develop your confidence-but don't get arrogant.<br>  <br>  Without confident, you'll never make it to step three-actual techniques.<br>  <br>  NEVER punch someone in the throat unless you are certain that your life is in danger.  Such an attack can KILL someone.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to enroll in a Dojo that teaches either Ju Jutsu (not Brazilian Jiu Jutsu-this is a sport art and not suited for actual conflict), Karate, Tae Kwon Do or Hapkido.  All of these arts are excellent for Self-defense and Ju Jutsu has served me well in every encounter I've ever come across.<br>  <br>  Awareness, confidence and only when you have those two-technique are all necessary for proper self-defense.<br>  <br>  Confidence comes from awareness and getting rid of the "I'm a victim" mentality you carry with you and show bullies.<br>  <br>  Here are a few hints you can try-<br>  <br>  1. Walk with your back straight. <br>  <br>  2. NEVER walk with your head down (I can't stress this enough!)<br>  <br>  3. If you are in school, don't walk with your books in front of you-it gives off the impression that you are expecting to be bullied (pulling an object such as a book towards you is a defensive posture).<br>  <br>  4. Have a neutral face when in public.<br>  <br>  5. If confronted, try to get around the other person.  <br>  <br>  6. If attacked, DO NOT get into a stance with your fists clenched!  This means you are ready to fight and anyone witnessing the fight will put on you equal blame when authorities/teachers, ect. are called.<br>  <br>  7. When provoked, back away with your hands out to your side and slightly in front of you, open.  It's both easier to sweep their hands away and it is a non confrontational stance.  Anyone that sees you like this will not assume you've picked a fight.<br>  <br>  But I would recommend a martial arts class, Ju Jutsu and Hapkido I'd put at the top of that list.  If those are not available, Karate or Tae Kwon Do are excellent choices as well.<br>  <br>  Be safe,<br>  Travis Anderson|`|sCFqZx9Zaa	more importantly, look at your psychological weaknesses. Its only partly about being able to fight|`|TTgLTMpDaa	Initially, just bulking up can help - bullying is often more about intimidation than actual fighting ability.<br>  <br>  If you desperately need to defend yourself, remember the weak points that all people have. A good punch in the throat will take down anyone, regardless of size and ability.<br>  <br>  Go to boxing lessons. Excellent workout, and the simple fact of your training will often be enough to make most bullies shy away.

rM5Tofhwaa	There are no reasons.  There are no laws in the universe, only reactions caused by variables.  There is no reason to live and no reason to die.  Life is not magical.  Our thoughts and our awareness of existence are human nature.  There is nothing magical about the human brain, it is made up of matter just like rocks.  It operates Through physical reactions.  So it doesn't matter how complex our questioning of existence is,  Life and non-life are the same thing.  The Variables affecting thought are called emotions.  This is how we react to everything around us.  The product of a working brain is thought and the sub product is emotion.  Human nature is to react according to the emotion, which is based off the will to live.  Humans have created higher standards of life which have created emotions that respond to smaller and smaller threats to our existence.   So, Ultimately, at every technological advancement, We feel more and more susceptible to the threat of our non-existence.  But, the human brain is also technologically advancing.  Our natural instinct is to live,  but human nature to collect and gather knowledge.  Once we abolish the sub product of the human brain, humanity will have reached a Utopia.  But, This Utopia cannot be reached because thought is only possible through the instrinsic motivations of emotions.  This Utopia is called death.  Death is non-existence.  With non-existence, there is no thought or emotion.  This is my philosophical view on the will to live.  If there is anything you disagree with, This is probably because I'm 14 and my brain is not fully developed in the english vocabulary, or maybe I'm just incapable of using dependable communication until i am fully matured.|`|eRzrH8vTaa	yes you will go to hell, <br>  LIFE GOES ON MY FRIEND<br>  it's stupid<br>  it has a bad stubborn reason behind it<br>  it's not worth it<br>  you will regret it<br>  that's not cool|`|5hlJwDBoaa	there is a reason you are here<br>  and God loves you =]<br>  make the best of things cry it helps =]|`|zU1hrRIgaa	A philisophical/spiritual reason for not commiting suicide is the fact that most people who believe in God, believe in love.

Sex, in part, is still giving to another person. It's not entirely selfish. <br>  <br>  Instead of thinking "Why pass on genes, and sentence another generation to hell...?" why not see it as, "how can my offspring, the generation of the future, benfit this world?

Us as humans, obviously went through quite a bit to even be here on this Earth right now. We developed for a long time and probably caused our poor mothers much discomfort. Prior to that though.. we had to get our little fishy-lookin' selves into that egg. Now.. out of those million some odd other little sperm, WE made it in. WE got in the egg. It could have been some other random one right? Yeah, well it wasn't. And before someone goes committing suicide they should really think about that. Not in the comical way, but in a serious, considerate way. Maybe if some other sperm entered the egg they would cherish their gift of life on Earth. Maybe they'd be one less grateful person on this planet. So this 'person' should consider that, and shoot for that type of attitude. Because life isn't meant to be thrown away, it's quite the opposite.|`|AA11217712	Only a sick brain thinks of suicide.....such a brain should not continue in that state....helpis everywhere if you want it.....an easy way out is to blow yourself up.....then what....you have ended a brain that could have been "retrained" and come up with ideas, concepts and other marvelous thoughts we are just looking for.....GET HELP...!!!!|`|hvjWpq2naa	You will miss the best part of the day :)  sociobiology as you interpret it seems fixed.

OUbNSXjJaa	The main reason is we should consider that this life has been given as a precious gift of God. We are supposed to preserve and make best use of the opportunity available during our life time to help our self and to help others as well.<br>  <br>  We are not supposed to misuse or abuse our body. Even we are not supposed to under utilize our body for mean purposes.<br>  <br>  We have several priorities which we assign to our life situation at different stages of our growth/progress.

It is used frequently to describe a collection of biological and behavior characteristics that help identify the source of physical illnesses, and mental aberrations.

So instead of feeling so down about things, learn to laugh a lot more and open yourself up more, talk about whats on your mind, even if its something that seems random and silly like "I wish vehicles had sinks" (or etc).

A lot of times, depression comes from focusing on yourself too much. Service gets your mind off of yourself while you're doing it because you're focusing on others, and afterward your self esteem goes up because you did something good. If you do service regularly it will also improve your attitude, character, integrity, and sensibility towards others, which are possible reasons why people dislike you.|`|k2wPknXlaa	When I felt like you do, I was told that I was depressed and should get some help.

m09snBrEaa	here are some bullet points i typed down while reading your question:<br>  <br>  -humans are animals and will almost certainly always be animals, the distinction comes from how we get energy(consuming other organisms)<br>  <br>  -accidents imply that an event runs contrary to a previously determined goal, evolution has no specific goal, neither does the universe, so to suggest that mutations are accidents isn't the best choice of words. mutations are mistakes made during the replication of genetic information.<br>  <br>  -Darwin proposed natural selection but he, as well as the people of his time, had no idea where the variations that were subjected to this selection came from, it wasn't until much later that we learned about genetics. <br>  <br>  -When a creature is evolved to it's niche differences are selected against, this is called regression to the mean, it isn't until the niche changes that different avenues open up and being different makes you better. you have to remember that evolution doesn't work like a transplant surgeon, new features are built up on the backs of old pre-existing features(note: we have observed over the course of 60 years a wall lizard evolving new structures in its stomach to aid in the digestion of plant matter)<br>  <br>  -you seem to not understand natural selection too well, the birds with better eyesight will have access to more food than birds with worse eyesight, therefore there will be more children with good eyesight and less with poor eyesight. natural selection explains why creatures are so fit to their environment.<br>  <br>  -don't think of evolution as reducing your worth, by making you the result of a string of accidents, there are more grand ways of putting it, for example being an evolved creature you are the result of survivors, you are part of a long long line of creatures that got it right, not wrong.|`|720bVz1yaa	Random mutations AND natural selection; not entirely accidental.|`|4WvdDCHSaa	The real problem is that our ordinary mind is unable to think on the scale of trillions of gnerations of fish & land animals who have been around more than 3.5 Billion years...|`|rW2Ey7hGaa	I haven't really read DARWIN..but think that he meant to say---that if your kept in a single formation..like..terrestial..or reptilian..or amphibian..you evolve--I think DARWIN...can prove size--or management---like deep diving or flying..but he really can't assess alot about evolution--because most don't evolve in formation...rampant(evolution)is a matter of susantance--rather than animal husbandry...Survialist(nature)--isn't really all that possible...<br>  ===<br>  So too consider God..as the place to gather the FOLD--the HERD--the FLOCK...really shows evolution as a WAVE--slapping a shore line---its contrite...its a false(promise)about life(God)...<br>  ===<br>  One who falls for evolution might consider alot of the world an OYSTER..or a dental cavity(sugar related)...<br>  Its contrite..its an excuse about---longevity...<br>  Assume your part monkey--part RAT--even a little of as worm...<br>  Evolutionally--your a fool.|`|BMxNOJ39aa	Your argument is an example of "reductio ad absurdum" or "where one assumes a claim for the sake of argument, derives an absurd or ridiculous outcome, and then concludes that the original assumption must have been wrong as it led to an absurd result"<br>  <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Reductio-ad-absurdum" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia...</a><br>  <br>  Take the bird of prey example.

YzoLa5Uuaa	Estimations are an inferential statistic that are used when you know there is an effect (or you found an effect) and you want to figure out the size of the effect in an unknown population.  The importance is that you do not have all the information to actually quantify so you must use an estimate to infer information about the population. <br>  <br>  Confidence intervals are important to qualify your estimation. Without a confidence interval an estimation is meaningless.

dmCyY2SKaa	In a lot of Islamic cultures the only thing that matters is an intact hymen. So women have oral and anal sex and sometimes intercourse, and then they get hymen reconstruction surgery so they are eligible for marriage. This usually only applies to more upper class Muslim women and to Muslim women who live in liberal societies/countries. Muslim women in more traditional countries and in poorer areas get married young, when they are about 14-16 or even younger. If you want a "pure" woman convert to Islam and then marry a 14 year old Muslim girl, to ensure that she is "pure".

It's not the people feeding a family on a production line who are at fault.  If you don't bail out the entity, you forsake them.  We don't stipulate in order to do so, management must change because that would be a break down of the free market democratic system we all work hard to excel at. Fact is, there are some little workers staying, I'm sure there are no ex vps on the assembly line. Hope this helps, it doesn't really but maybe we understand it a bit...and can do thing in the future to stop this.|`|fZQ2uK1Xaa	The bailout for the auto makers is a contentious issue for a good reason, and people have a right to be upset about it. The fuel crisis of the 1970s was a wake-up call - but the North American manuifacturers mumbled a few things about trying to make cars a little better and hit the snooze button.<br>  <br>  Here is the issue: the 20th Century was the century of the automobile, replacing the 19th Century and the development of the railroad. It happens that the huge population growth in North America in the second half of the 20th Century combined with the avilability of land meant people expected to be able to own homes - their own little plot of land. People in countries with poverty, high population density, and long histories of family lands being split from generation to generation, don't expect to own houses. So North America, with its abundance of land (we won't talk about how that land was acquired) promised a different future.<br>  <br>  In order to meet that demand for homes, our cities built suburbs. We spread out unstead of building up. Take a look at Hong Kong - an island which could not spread out. Skyscraper condominiums which are leased for 99 years, not owned in perpetuity, stretch up 70 storeys.<br>  <br>  The only way spreading out was viable was to assume that every family would have a car. The car is part of the mythology of North America. Often people who live in dense urban centres in other countries won't have a car. Some centres have severe restrictions on who can have a car and who gets to drive in the downtown core (check out Singapore). but in North America, the car is seen as something of a right.<br>  <br>  This means the North American market is very rich for car manufacturers. That is one reason why the manufacturers could afford to be so lazy: they counted on xenophobia and protectionism to safeguard their domestic market. And because the cities were built with the assumption that cars would be used to get around, people are stranded without them: so many people who live too far away from grocery stores, medical facilities, recreational facilities - we've built the cities in such a way that cars are necessary, which means the market will continue to be there.<br>  <br>  If the big North American manufacturers are allowed to die, that rich market goes to foreign companies - and that upsets the balance of trade. Hardly anyone would argue that the North American auto manufacturers have acted responsibly or that they should be given a bail-out on the basis of any virtue of the companies themselves. The reason to bail them out is to keep the money from that North American market circulating in North America instead of going to foreign interests.<br>  <br>  So why does bad management get to stay? That's a tough question. First, despite having refused to see the writing on the wall, they do already have the infrastructure for manufacturing and selling cars. They know how to do it - perhaps not as well as they should, but probably better than someone who has not been in the industry ever. Second, they made the mess so it seems right to make them clean it up. Think of the lessons of your childhood: mom could have cleaned it up better and faster, but it was important that you learn how to do it yourself. It's a judgment call here: that management is able to learn from mistakes. With a huge amount of public money at stake, everyone will be watching them. Those executives have a strong financial and emotional incentive to turn things around - a stronger incentive than someone who parachutes in from outside, knowing they can't do any worse than the previous crew.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with the thinking. I would like to see what would happen if you got a young team of pragmatic visionaries to revamp the whole system and produce cool and cheap environmentally friendly cars. Flush out the dinosaurs and get the innovators in - not people who change the shape of the gearshift and hail it as an ergonomic breakthrough, but people who change the basic concept of a car and what it means.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, we have ourselves to blame. North Americans allowed this to happen by continuing to buy cars that were bad for us, cars that guzzled gas. People say to me: "I have to have a minivan; I have kids!" and I think back to my childhood. There were three kids and two parents and we never needed a minivan. My brother is one of those people: he has two kids. I guess he's forgotten how much we walked and how efficiently our cars got us wherever we needed to go.|`|Grb85RJuaa	General Motors should be bailed out because I want a Pontiac G8 GT when I graduate college so I want them to still be around then.

60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Conversation should be easy and relaxed - and you don`t have to talk non-stop.<br>  <br>  Good conversation goes along lke a tennis match - their serve, you react. You serve they react.<br>  <br>  Let them do most of the talking at first: most people love to talk.   Just keep them going by encouraging remarks. Add your little bit when you think of something.|`|BZcVLM8faa	i us2 be like that but its as simple as making small talk then that helps develop the habit in talking|`|icC8xHRhaa	look in the mirror and say.. i believe.. lol try to be more outgoing and fun.  look for some topic like how those clothes are fashionable or something lk that.
gWlmU1KJaa	water dreams usually mean you need to wake up and pee!|`|HQ4PsETWaa	It means you want to go on a water slide.  Go to a water park and fix your need.|`|U9cLxjUjaa	are they scary dreams or fun dreams?<br>  <br>  If they are scary, I would think that you might have an underlying fear of water slides ha ha, pretty obvious right?<br>  <br>  if they aren't scary, maybe you're just looking forward to summer, warmer weather, vacation, or need some fun in your life.|`|LxZFioqwaa	I guess it means you like water slides.<br>  Its a dream, it doesnt necessarily mean anything, I had a dream about having incest with my sister, horrible I know but I would never. Dreams are just something for your mind to do when your asleep.<br>  <br>  Dont worry.|`|qjFXTVYoaa	When ever i have a dream i go to the website - www.dreammoods.com just type your  dream in the search box.|`|oxEYZB9waa	it means you have an intrest in water slides|`|Dvdq59HHaa	all I know is that in dreams in my belief, water represents healing or destruction, I know, that is so not helpful cuz they are totally opposite. If it is bugging you and you think there is meaning behind it, ask God to reveal it to you, and be patient with the answer you get. I hope that helped at least a little :/|`|HEmvuDy7aa	well, a dream is kind of a mix of what happened in your day, so if you're thinking about or see water slides all day, you might have multiple dreams about them.|`|HDnZlQDYaa	you have to pee really bad.
