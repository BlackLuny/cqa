Z980TqG3aa	I am 15 and I went on a Carnival cruise this summer. There really wasnt much to do for our age group. There is some teen club but nobody goes to it. They have "dance parties" where everybody just sits on the sides and watches the empty dance floors.  It is actually really pathetic. I still had fun because I had like 10 cousins with me. If youre going alone then you'd better find some place better to chill. That cruise line is really more younger kid oriented. A royal caribbean one would be better.|`|KUIkR7k9aa	Im not sure about carnival but Royal Carribbean is amazing.

The mountains are beautiful. In Hot Springs there are really old bath houses and natural hot springs boiling up from under the earths crust.

We have more land, bigger homes with yards, and just more space overall for everything.  I think that it all is perspective to what you have and the amount of space that you have.<br>  Not all Americans have big rooms for closets.  Many have small closets and few cloths.  Again, it depends on your means, where you are, and how much 'space' you have in your home to live.<br>  <br>  As a past visitor to Germany, Amsterdam, Holland, and a few other countries in Europe, I see Americans as much more wasteful people.  We all have cars because we don't have the public transportation available to us that people in Europe have.  It is a fast food mentality here.  Everything is trashed.  For instance, in Europe, you get a drink in a glass cup that is washed and reused.  In America it is a paper cup that is thrown out.  We have more 'space' for a dump.  That is not necessarily a good thing.  We will all have to live with today's trash tomorrow.  In Europe there is not as much space for a dump.  Therefore, things are recycled much more freely than in the US.  It all comes back to space.  More space here for more junk.....closets included.|`|ISxdNDeGaa	I have a one big closet !!! it is called " my bedroom" lol<br>  since my clothes are thrown everywhere all over the room. =p

URZNtrxsaa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  A time share is like a Condo complex that has weekly owners. There are 52 weeks in the year, and each of the individual Condos within the complex have in effect 52 owners. One owner may buy more then one week, but in reality, you own 1/52 of one apartment within this complex. The units are usually a one, two or three bedroom type apartment with as many bath's, full kitchen, living room, dining room. Some have balconies, most have swimming pools and if by water, are located on the beach. There are beach time shares, mountain time shares (for ski fans or summer hikers when there is no snow). There are also associations that allow you to trade your week (or points that allow you to buy a week or less) with other time share owners anywhere in the world. I have one in Kauai that we use each year.|`|iuY0sIL9aa	Nice places to stay at (normally)<br>  TOTAL WASTE OF YOUR MONEY - DON'T CONSIDER BUYING ONE!<br>  <br>  For the cost of a timeshare, plus fees, and this and that, you could stay at a very nice hotel wherever and whenever you wanted - or not at all if a vacation does not fit in with your time/money this year.|`|wztEAVm2aa	It's a place where you vacation and crazy sales people follow you around trying to get you to buy more time there and you have to attend meetings and it's really annoying.|`|VP7A10bXaa	it's when you share property with like 30 other people, and you can only use the place you bought for like 1 week out of the year. It's so stupid because you don't really own the place.|`|7Q1dJoFzaa	I bet wikipedia knows.|`|Run7dyraaa	a timeshare is a property you purchase allowing you to use the property I believe two weeks out of the year, or something along those lines. The property is actually shared. But you only have use of the property at a designated time. It is not your primary residence.
103d3879d1499695e3f4a5d95bcd053baa	that's an excellent question well i call myself ulster scots or northern irish in equal measure basically the protestants  were taught british history in our schools we never really knew our cultural background at all that's why you'll see scottish flags at a lot of our events now, we certainly weren't taught scottish history either which is such a shame as everyone should be proud of their culture. thanks for asking. also whatt gydion says is true we are of english and welsh extraction as well.|`|uKrdjrJiaa	It is because NI is under British rule and governed by British Law.A lot of people in NI show loyalty to the British crown hence 'Loyalists'.I have an Irish passport only cos I always had one.<br>  Good question BTW -Would be surprised if anyone could be annoyed by it!|`|zfslaO95aa	The "English" crown is as much scottish as it is English. Please dont fall for the misconception that Britain is England. Its England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.|`|x3uCecWsaa	Its very simple, I was born and reared ( that's a N.I. phrase) in N.I.so i am first an Northern Irish man or Ulster man-please don't pick me up on a technicality, I know there is nine county's in Ulster.<br>  Second; i'm british, because like Scotland, Wales and England , this province is part of the UK.<br>  I would put it another way, Scottish history tells us they  had a more troubled and totally barbaric experience from the English than what the Irish ever had.. So in my opinion,  the Irish Republicans haven't got the monopoly, being the "victims".<br>  Furthermore, we cannot be held accountable for our forefathers mistakes/sins. As i said before this part of the UK is my birthright, and am proud of,,first, Ulster-man, and second British, this is my culture and heritage.<br>  In conclusion, its not the English crown , its the British crown-English,Scottish , Wales and Northern Irish. That's what makes the UK so unique, we've all our own individual Heritage, but we're all joined by a common bond, being British..  .|`|e6beff3f5c5781b0086dcc2c0e92cff9aa	II'm from NI and call myself Norn Irish but have a British passort.  My family originally are from Wales on my dad's side and Holland on my mums but I don't call myself Welsh or Dutch.  <br>  <br>  This kind of reminds me of how many people from america say they are irish but have never even been to Ireland and just call themselves that because their grandparents are.<br>  <br>  You should call youself how you feel.  I feel Northern Irish as have always lived in NI but also call myself British as it is a british country with British law etc.  But sometimes I do call myself Irish when I'm away as often people don't undstand how some one from NI is British when you go on hols and things and it saves you getting into a long discussion about unionisim and nationalisim and blah blah blah who really cares?<br>  <br>  It is just a big mess to be honest and well its our wee mess and it makes our country what it is.<br>  <br>  That prob didn't make any sense but hey!<br>  <br>  xx|`|dUiLMwZyaa	I've traveled around there and this is what I seem to think. <br>  <br>  I thought they were Irish because they are in Ireland.  They don't call themselves Scottish because they don't live in Scotland.  <br>  <br>  Irish, Scottish, Welsh and English are all British because they are from the British Isles.  Scotts are very patriotic and will always call themselves Scottish.|`|7iHdQheKaa	Usually because of the problems here. Most protestants will say British and most Catholics will say Irish. Though, theres a lot of people in between and they say Northern Irish|`|wE8NppnLaa	Not all the "planters" were Scottish; but Scots culture has had a big influence in Ulster and it's speech patterns too.|`|89ff4d66abc41fa64f9e0ff2d5b6ffd4aa	One, because it is not the "English" crown.  The current monarch is actually descended from Germans.  The monarch that started the "plantations" in Ulster was James VI (of Scotland)!!  I don't know why unionists in Ulster would call themselves British before calling themselves Ulstermen.  We had exactly the same thing in Scotland as to the religious rivalry but that died out here in the 17th century when our "Killing times" came to an end.  Sadly given the events in Northern Ireland over the past few days it seems Ulster still has a long way to go.

IIC9e3JQaa	no zoo in the uk will allow you to do this, for various reasons including health and safety (even baby tigers can hurt)<br>  <br>  you may find zoos abroad that have less strict rules (and health and safety issues), but the best you could hope for is to view baby tigers from a distance through a wire fence i'm afraid|`|WhAKntgGaa	Sorry, i only know a place where you can hold tigers for free.|`|6YXPHVpBaa	They Dont let you do that anymore, its illegal,

pxbAVuNXaa	You can order for your provisional license 3 months before your 17th birthday, but it only becomes valid when your 17. The provisional means that you can drive if there's someone with 3 year's driving experience next to you.<br>  <br>  Once you've passed your theory and practical test you can drive all you like! (even if you're 17)|`|AA10310496	You can see from the following government site the official ages at which you can drive different types of vehicle on a public highway.  You are right in saying that you can drive at 17 with a provisional, but the person accompanying you must be over 21, and have held a clean driving licence for the same category of car that you will be driving for at least three years.  There has been talk of raising the lower age limit to 18...but that is all it is at the moment....just talk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/DriverLicensing/WhatCanYouDriveAndYourObligations/DG_4022547" rel="nofollow">http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/Motoring/Dri...</a>|`|FOovSpAOaa	At the moment in the UK you can drive straight at 17 after you've passed your test

lys5kB9Daa	Both coasts are extremely expensive. <br>  The cost of living indexes are as follows-<br>  Seattle- 120<br>  San Fran- 166<br>  Los Angeles- 131<br>  San Diego- 129<br>  Boston- 127<br>  New York City- 135<br>  Washington DC- 129<br>  Compared with non-coastal cities such as<br>  Phoenix- 93<br>  Oklahoma City- 79<br>  Indianapolis- 92<br>  <br>  I am from Massachusetts and it is extremely expensive to live, even 2 hours outside of Boston in the sticks. You cannot get a decent house under 225 (and thats just decent not even nice) - compared to some states you can get brand new gorgeous house for 140. The property taxes are pretty high. The state sales tax is actually pretty low at 5%- they make up for it in property and income taxes. The pro's are that it's very cultural, educational, liberal. A con besides the cost of living is weather obviously. It's not just winter for 3 months like people assume, it's freakin cold from October to April a good 6 months. I love Mass though- except the weather, everything else is great. Oh and much more down to earth than the west coast. Everybody in California only cares about tans and Hummer's and material things. I hate that about the west. East coast people are not like that, they drive sensible cars and dont care as much about looks and showing off.|`|AA12365543	Kim is full of crap.  I see Hummers all the time as well as huge pickups and SUVS, people are arrogant, rude, and driving is almost as bad as in India.  Oh plus the government corruption is ranked ine the top 5, not far from Illinois.  The state isnt that liberal either, youll find the locals are normally in between right and left. The outsiders who move here are the leftist who keep voting for woman killer Ted Kennedy and Rich snob from Beacon Hill Kerry.|`|7jhR6r5waa	The real answer lies somewhere in between both of the above. Housing prices are high, but less than California. Cities and towns close to Boston are expensive. Obviously, the farther away from Boston, the cheaper they get. Houses are also expensive on the water for obvious reasons, but the recession has hit Mass also. Yes, there is an income tax, but so is there in most other states, but there property taxes are not that bad. Yes there are Hummers and Suvs as there are in all othere places. The drivers are as rude as they are in all other big cities. I do think that groceries are less expensive on the East Coast, as are clothes, furniture, commodities thanks to a lot of discounters. But our heating costs are high and our electricity costs are pretty high.|`|DLwvk4XCaa	Cost of living in MA is wicked expensive.  I live right outside Boston in Somerville which is right outside Boston 5min north of Boston.  Lived here all my life and it is wicked expensive.  My mother owns a 2 family house and she rents out both apartments.  First floor is $800-$1000 a month and second floor is $1200-$1500 a month.  Only reason why second floor is more is cause there is 2 floors and has 3 bedrooms.  The closer you are to Boston the more expensive it will be.<br>  <br>  Also if you decide to live here then you MUST have health insurence it is the law now in massachusetts and if you don't have it you get penilized on your taxes.
DRPThd2Qaa	It seems that you need to apply visa before you go to enter Vietnam, because no such visa exemptions for Australian or Italian. For Cambodia it is possible to obtain visa on arrival on certain points of entry or otherwise apply for the e-visa.
5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	Ok you need the know the rules of the tickets. All tickets come with rules, usually the cheaper it is, the more rules there are like - changes at an amount, no changes allowed, no refund value etc. He should call up the airline and check if there is a refund value for the ticket. However, be prepared that he will definitely not be able to get the full refund back if there is refund. There is always an admin charge unless traveler couldnt travel due to accident/death.
ZhqDZPfraa	Trying to meet friends can be tough in CA, especially in San Diego! Taking a class is a good start - if it's an educational or academic class be sure to form a study group.  I would also recommend getting involved in some type of group based activity like yoga, volleyball, join a running club, etc.  If your not into being outdoors and active then check out some other activities based on your interest.  There are always random and fun events that go on in San Diego.  Check out mixer nights in the Gas Lamp district, which are tailored to meeting new people and not necessarily in a "hooking up" sort of way.  You could also volunteer somewhere or pick up a part time job to make extra cash and meet people at the same time.<br>  <br>  The best thing I can say is to get out there!  San Diego can be a great place to meet people but you have to really put yourself out there and be patient.  I know it's hard (trust me I just recently moved across the country too) but try to use every opportunity for ways that you can build connections.  - And don't get discouraged - people can be a little "unwelcoming" in CA but there are really nice and cool people there too!<br>  <br>  Also go up a bit to PB (Pacific Beach)  It's a great place to hang out and has more relaxed environment!
Lngb8ryFaa	there's no place in the world like provincetown---portuguese fishing village that is a gay mecca, seems like a strange combination but it works,,<br>  <br>  to enjoy cape cod to the fullest you have to be active :: do the whale watches, get an off-road vehicle pass for the beaches, get a bonfire permit for the beach (most people dont even know these activties exhist), tour the lighthouses, do a deep sea fishing tour, ride the bike paths thru the beach forest...<br>  <br>  ...the cape is one the most amazing places on the planet|`|mZi7R0Enaa	the perfect place: beautiful, quaint, busy and tons of fun!|`|9OqSl1Jlaa	It is beautiful.  But, it is rather cool except in August.|`|1ViGcF3xaa	I go there a couple of times a year and my suggestion is to go during the off season like early June or September/October.  The weather is usually very nice then too.<br>  The crowds will be much smaller and the lodging rates are a lot less.<br>  My favorite places to visit are Falmouth, Provincetown, Oak Bluffs and Edgartown.  The last 2 are on Martha's Vineyard island which you can take ferries to from Woods Hole, Falmouth, or Hyannis on the Cape.|`|qQT2shZPaa	wonderful, i go there every year in the summer, it is made up of many different towns, like yarmouth, south yarmouth, dennis, provincetown,orleans,truro. there are many great beaches, with semi large waves, and nice clean water, it has many golf courses, mini golf, nice restaurants, shopping, etc. We usually stay at the red jacket riviera, in south yarmouth, it is right off the beach. the average hotel right on the beach is around 300 $ but you can stay at cheaper motels off the main road, for about 100$ a night. and  you can go to the public beaches.  It is very large area, but has a small town feel. very charming and quaint. Very relaxing.|`|SwtKi7czaa	Expensive and overrated.|`|47P7uLV6aa	I grew up on Cape Cod and actually, I think it's boring!  I'm not a beach person...  <br>  <br>  I've always been amazed at how many people love the beaches on the Cape.  Most of them are NOT nice to swim in, they are far too rocky!  You need swim shoes just to get to the water.  They are lovely, yes, but not so fun.  <br>  <br>  Province Town is a blast, so much to see, so much shopping.  The board walk in Sandwich is fun.  Silver Beach in Falmouth is one of the few NOT rocky beaches.  I think the National Seashore is probably very nice too -- it's been years since I was there.  <br>  <br>  If you like bike riding, the Bike Path is great.  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|GeVNkQQSaa	Cape Cod is beautiful.  Quaint New England.  Beautiful beaches, great restaurants, great biking.  You wil love it.|`|kznmQ2NDaa	the best place you can ever go.<br>  i live 25 mins away and am there every SINGLE day during the summer

I guess they have restaurants, bars, amusement park, swimming....etc.|`|GM63jFD2aa	The best place I've found to "party it up" this time of year is Windsor, Canada. Since you are going on the weekend, the clubs will be jumpin'. PLUS... you can get away WITHOUT a passport until June 1st. All you need is your drivers license or state id and birth certificate. Some of the best times I've ever had when I've went out for a night was when I went to Canada. I love it :) It's just minutes (seriously like 30 minutes including exchanging your money, going through customs, parking, getting into the bar, etc) from downtown Detroit. It's WELL WORTH every dollar you will spend.<br>  <br>  This is amazing... you honestly can't find a better place to "party it up" where it's busy, everyone is there to drink and dance and have a good time. You can not find this anywhere else this time of year.<br>  <br>  If you're willing to wait and like country music, the downtown hoedown in Hart Plaza located in Detroit Michigan is absolutely AMAZING. It's a party weekend and a great time. You will LOVE it.|`|aa1OGptZaa	Kalahari resort in Sandusky Ohio<br>  <a href="http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.kalahariresorts.com/oh/Defaul...</a><br>  <br>  Maumee Bay state park near Toledo<br>  <a href="http://www.maumeebayresort.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maumeebayresort.com/</a><br>  <br>  Mountain Grand Lodge in Boyne Falls Michigan<br>  <a href="http://www.mountaingrandlodge.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mountaingrandlodge.com/</a><br>  <br>  Another option with alot of fun/partying is to head across the bluewater bridge in Port Huron to Niagara Falls Canada (from port huron it's about 3 hours.)

KWZdVwQ5aa	Its free!<br>  <br>  But....be warned. The bridge is 1.6 miles long...one way. The railing is only 4 feet tall. It can have extreme winds and is often freezing. Make sure you dress warm and I would reccomend only walking halfway, that way you can still make it back, otherwise you'll be walking almost 4 miles in windy, freezing conditions. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|79f98037d95b69999bfd927327c7ee10aa	No, but you do have to pay to park in the parking lot.|`|AA12339318	No, not to walk it.|`|W9veKxfgaa	nope it's free, but don't forget to bring a jacket.

Well depends where you go, like the Grand Canyon will be pretty cold at night around then, same with flagstaff but sleeping bags can fix that. <br>  <br>  I went camping in Sedona awhile ago, it was pretty cold when i went, just google sedona, i went camping in this one place call pine flats or it was around that area, those camp grounds are pretty nice. Just the bathrooms suck and smell aweful, don't get a place close to that. <br>  <br>  Greer ( not sure how to spell it ) is just beautiful!! Pretty cold though. Be sure to visit the Grand Canyon!
EJpiaCMQaa	You can use the Metro bus service in Houston.  I used it when I visited Houston to get around.

8Y7LQ6TGaa	Kraków is a great place to visit. <br>  <br>  Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.<br>  <br>  Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums. <br>  <br>  The most striking thing I remember from Kraków is the Kraków Hourly Trumpet Signal<br>  <br>  Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Kraków's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Kraków signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of Zywiec.<br>  <br>  Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train from Kraków.<br>  <br>  Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.|`|cc198e7f4ab424c24743237d7bdb642aaa	This isn't exactly what you're asking,,, but read "Poland" by James Michener.  He writes historical fiction about all sorts of regions and areas.  They are great books, and while though they are novels, hold a pretty accurate history/timeline.  The book is out of print, but you can find a copy for a few bucks on e-bay or amazon.  In fact, I just replaced my copy.  I gave my last one to a Polish friend.  Good luck.

EJpiaCMQaa	I'm planning a trip to Pittsburgh in May and I'm also planning on visiting Fallingwater.  It's a 90 minute drive from Pittsburgh.  I wouldn't plan on taking a cab that far or you'll go broke.  You will need to rent a car at Pittsburgh airport and drive to the Fallingwater site.  If you rent a car, check out Enterprise's website.  I booked my rental car with Enterprise, because it was the only reasonably priced car rental at Pittsburgh Airport.<br>  <br>  You may want to visit House On The Rock in Spring, Green Wisconsin, instead.

CZp3UdQdaa	What your friends are suggesting is perfect! Don't worry because you'll have no trouble finding an agency or tour in Cusco.  However booking your ticket in advance might be a good idea, only 2 good airlines fly from Lima to Cusco (Lan and Taca, although Lan tends to be cheaper and equally good and often has some promotions).  I'm going to Peru again later this year and already bought my ticket to Cuzco with Lan just make sure you buy your ticket from the peruvian website and not the international one because tickets tend to cost almost twice as much! If you prefer to have your whole trip planned out you could try llamapath (<a href="http://www.llamapath.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.llamapath.com/)</a> they are great! I went with them on the inca trail and everything was arranged perfectly.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|HwujORd2aa	We got cheap advance fares just by doing research on Kayak.com.  If you're traveling on a schedule you don't want to get to Lima and find out you can't get out the day you want to-though there are plenty of flights.  You can buy local for tours-quality varies, but ask lots of questions and you'll get ideas of who's good and who's not. We just used the guy that did the hotel pickup and he was great.<br>  You can also do lots of self-tours.  We got our Machu Picchu train tickets and did a self guided tour with a book.<br>  Lonely Planet seemed to be the favorite guidebook for anyone we talked to, and I know they're great, so get one and read it for ideas of must-sees.  <br>  Also see your doc for meds for altitude sickness, hep A, etc, and you really want to make sure your shots are up to date.  Never get tap water in your mouth and pace yourself-even if you feel good you can become a victim of altitude sickness if you're not careful.  You won't know til you get there-even really fit athletes find they're not immune!<br>  Best of all, have fun and enjoy it.  It's fantastic.|`|fmQIU0zqaa	Nope. Sounds nice though.|`|LCwtu4Wyaa	I have been to Cuzco twice and loved it. Stay in Cuzco for a few days to acclimatise. There are plenty of travel agencies who offer reasonably priced tours or airfares to other places. I payed $100 for a fare from Cuzco to Arequipa. A reasonable hotel to stay is "Cuzco Plaza 2", which is a 7 minute walk from the Plaza De Armas. I payed around $ 50 per night, b'fast included . A top place to eat is the Irish Pub, right in the hub at the Plaza De Armas. Do some walking in Cuzco, there are many beautiful buildings and narrow streets. But take it easy, especially uphill! Taxis anywhere in Cuzco cost between 5 and 7 soles. If you are paying more than 10 soles, you are beeing ripped off. Negotiate the price before you go. Not too many taxis have meters.<br>  Go for a walk around the plaza at night. The lights up in the hills and around the plaza and the beautiful fountain, it's magic, and very safe.<br>  Buy yourself a train ticket to Macchu Picchu. You get off at Aguas Caliente, where you can explore the markets and the cafe's and eating places. From there a bus will take you up for 4 km to the inca city.<br>  Enjoy !|`|JZMfUDylaa	Sounds cool I don't know anything about Cusco except it reminds me of the emperor's new grove! lol "what's his name?" "Kuzco!"

Make sure you have very comfortable shoes that you can walk miles in.  <br>  <br>  Sudden showers are also common, so you might want to have a rain poncho on hand--the ones they sell at Disney cost a fortune.  If you sweat a lot, you might want to bring a shirt to change into; personally, I'd head somewhere for a mid-afternoon break (onsite hotel, lunch at a table service restaurant, etc).|`|AA10183247	Definitely dress for warm weather, as it will be very warm, if not hot.

v2Ubw5hTaa	Egypt is overpopulated. The wealth in Egypt is low relative to its population. Because of this dynamic, the government in Egypt cannot afford to adequately take care of the population by Western standards. Thus, there will always be down-trodden slums in Egypt; that is, unless the Egyptian government implements a one-child policy like in China to attain a more sustainable population, but that is unlikely.

Fz5TLaLDaa	It depends how long you are planning to spend at Disney. If you want 14 day passes it costs in to buy them in the UK. Disney want to keep all of your money so they give the best value for length of stay tickets.<br>  <br>  Because of the bad exchange rate the prices of tickets have all gone up for UK buyers whether you buy in sterling here or dollars when you get there.<br>  <br>  Assuming you are on a 14 day holiday you might also want to visit Universal / IOA so you would be looking at 7 days of Disney and 2 or 3 days of Universal and or Sea World.<br>  <br>  Build in some rest days for the pool or shopping - you might want to go to the beach or to the Kennedy Space Centre.<br>  <br>  Compare the prices for what you want between UK brokers and log on to the Disney website to check out prices for passes for fewer days.<br>  <br>  The Disney website is annoying because it directs you to the GB site but if you backspace on the URL until you get back to the com it will take you to the American version to see the prices in dollars.<br>  <br>  Attraction tix in the UK are doing a cashback of 4% if you pay by paypal which might be good if you are buying a lot of expensive tickets|`|1d82076c63425fc7ea90d65c2c51804baa	Buy them on-line.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/" rel="nofollow">http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/</a>|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Hmm, well I don't really know how the money system works. go online and buy theme would probably be best.|`|PSiNv7gUaa	I would buy them online and have them mailed to you.  Otherwise when you get there, you have to go to the Transportation and Ticket Center, and the lines are ridiculous.  I had bought mine online, but others in my party didn't, and we ended up having to wait for half an hour while they stood in line.  Buy them online and avoiding wasting fun time in line for tickets, there will be plenty of line-waiting in the actual parks.

If you're talking more about a reservation, than your best bet is up in Northern Arizona.  The Navajo & Hopi reservations are up north, the Navajo being the bigger of the two reservations & extending into what we call the 4 corners area where the 4 states all meet at one intersection.  The Hopi reservation is much smaller, it lies inside of the Navajo reservation & then you have the Tohono O'Odham reservation which lies along the border of Arizona/Mexico.  Then you have the Akimal O'Odham, on the outskirts of Phoenix going toward Tucson & a variety of other little tribes all over.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	east arizona|`|4qEoDeyzaa	Try Flagstaff
kMK9E2a7aa	Hire a car is best and more convenient. Driving should take you about one hour and a half. You can fly into Granada but I have no idea where you are flying from. Certain places in the UK Ryanair fly to Granada. The best budget airline and the cheapest in Spain is Vueling. They also fly into Granada.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	There are buses, and trains.  Or you could just get a connecting flight to the Granada airport...I think that MIGHT be the easiest and quickest way.

Port Adelaide is a second option, but much of it is not for the faint hearted.  Unley and it's surrounds is considered the finest area in Adelaide.  Elizabeth is further north and has a splendid shopping centre and inexpensive housing.
zgTsCicNaa	In summer in Scotland temperatures get slightly warmer reaching an average around 18-22degC during the day. Night time temperatures will usually drop to around 10degC. June can be fairly settled often with long spells of good weather. Rain can be on the horizon at any time though so bear that in mind if you are planning to be outdoors. From June until the end of August, Scottish midges are around on the west coast and in the Highlands of Scotland. Even if the weather is good, the midge can make life intolerable out of doors so some kind of midge protection is advisable.<br>  <br>  The summer is Scotland's most unpredictable and temperamental season You can get anything from rainy days without an end to smashing sunny days. It just depends on luck. The first time around when i went to Scotland I spent 4 weeks out of which I had to spend one indoors because of pouring rain. The second time around however, in 7 weeks I had only a handful of pouring days of which the one I remember best is the day I went to Stirling and from 10 am when I set foot in Stirling to 6 PM when I left to Edinburgh I got soaked to the skin (needless to say I was caught off guard and had no umbrella).|`|eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	Last year in August 2008 Glasgow had temperatures between 71°F / 21°C  and 57°F / 13°C  and it rained on 28 days out of the 31 With a couple of thunderstorms and some fog as well. <br>  The link below shows all the detail.<br>  There is no guarantee that the weather next August wil be anything like the weather last year but you will have an idea of what to expect. <br>  It depends on what the weather is like in August where you live, you may find it cooler than you are used to. Dressing in layers is a good idea, you can add and remove as necessary. A light windproof / waterproof jacket is a definite must, don't go outside without it.<br>  I am sure that, whatever the weather chucks at you, you will enjoy your stay.|`|6ZmiuwWDaa	I do not think the weather will be too great, but the chances are during the summer it will not be bad either. The weather can be un-predictable at times, Glasgow can get really hot in summer, I live up North, which is cold and mild most of the time, rarely is it ever hot, however I can get surprised as the weather can get really hot up hear to in summer (Heat waves in the past for example, though I feel this summer will not be as good as the previous summers). I know Glasgow will be pretty warm, It will not be freezing, I would say mild/warm-average, so bring mixed clothing, clothes in which may partially expose you to the weather conditions, no sleeves-will not be unbearable to wear, but also bring your more casual everyday clothes which you may wear during not so good weather (Long sleeves etc, not your sunny wear, nevertheless bring your thinner clothes for sun as well, may be sunny indeed) and jackets-*just to make sure* like proper jackets, the weather like I said, can be unpredictable, for all you know, it could be raining. The weather is more unpredictable here (U.K.) than any other country as we have got it all.|`|f45810e229d846a72c1ff069015e7a1eaa	Safest to assume that there will not be summer weather.... but then again you might be lucky.  Near Glasgow it rains a lot - so clothes that you can layer on and off as appropriate and an umbrella or waterproofs.
d6b1Dke1aa	We were at Atlantis last August, and took a taxi from the ship.. <br>  <br>  When you dock at the pier.. It's a LONG walk from the ship to the taxi stand.  If you look carefully, you may find the "pier shuttle".. I think it was a little bus?  It actually took us for free to the building where the taxi's were.   When we were in Nassau, it was POURING down rain (We were there in the middle of Tropical Storm Fay).  <br>  <br>  We actually paid for an Atlantis excursion which was really expensive with the ship ($400+ for 3 of us) and our excursion was cancelled because of the weather.. but we took a taxi to the hotel anyways. <br>  I believe the taxi was $10 for all 3 of us.  You can actually SEE the hotel from the pier, but you have to go around the bay to get there. I think it was less than a 10 minute taxi ride to get there.<br>  <br>  The excursion we were supposed to go on included swimming and waterslides for the day at Atlantis, and also a tour through "The Dig" Aquarium.    We were able to buy tickets at the hotel to go through the aquarium area (I believe it cost us $38 for two adults and 1 child).  It took about 30 minutes to walk through the aquarium with a kid.. stopping to look at all the fish?     <br>  Then, we walked around the hotel and grounds (and got all wet, but it was free!)   There is a nice casino in the hotel, if you're interested in that, and a few gift shops.  There is a waterslide area that goes right through the middle of the shark tank, and you are able to walk over and watch the sharks thorugh the glass..   <br>  We also walked over to the dolphin pool and saw the dolphins practicing in their area.  I believe they have a little dolphin show, but because of the stormy weather, it was closed, but we were able to see the dolphins over the fence - doing flips. <br>  <br>  If you're not really interested in using their swimming pools, don't buy the excursion from the ship.  You can save a LOT of money by taking the taxi over and seeing the resort yourself.  (Like I said.. we spent maybe $48 total instead of $400+)  There are also nice restaurants at the resort, so if you wanted to just take the taxi over, eat lunch and wander around.. that's very easy to do.  I'm not quite sure it's even necessary to pay the $ to go through the aquarium unless you are a BIG fish fan.  You can see a big aquarium for free right from the lobby area (I think there's a restaurant there where you can sit at a table and eat next to the big fishtank.. and I mean  - it's a fishtank, like, half a football field long)... and you can see the sharks for free, and the dolphins for free, if you look over the fence and go to the dolphin area gift shop.<br>  <br>  It's a nice place.. even in the pouring rain! :-)<br>  I hope you like it!|`|b1w5FUGzaa	I went to nassau bahamas when i was on a cruise.  We took the "city tour and shopping excursion".  When we got off the ship we had to wait for our driver, they are small vans that fit no more than 8 to 10 people.  Im not sure if you booked an excursion through the cruise ship or if you're going to just get off the ship and find your own way to Atlantis resort.  As part of my shopping excursion, we got to stop off at the Atlantis resort, you have to cross a bridge to get to it but it's fairly close to the pier.  It's beautiful.  There are some shops inside, restaurants, and on the back side are the pools and slides and stuff.  We weren't there long enough to do much, just toured the place and admired their fish !  It was nice though.  There are tons of taxi's at the pier, you shouldn't have a problem !|`|zCzPnQ2Baa	i went there 2 summers ago, and i LOVED it<br>  the aquarium is the best part and you get to walk around the whole resort and use their pools&water slide<br>  <br>  its a gorgeous resort and you will love it,<br>  and it wasn't even that expnsive for the aquarium and the taxi rides|`|2wBg5abXaa	I went there about 5-6 years ago, it was one of the most amazing vacations I ever took that's for sure.

6uQh4VSpaa	I don't have a scientific answer, but my experience: I lived there for three months, and had two earthquakes that were enough to worry me (one woke me up at night, the other rattled all the equipment in the lab where I was working).  There were also a few smaller ones (like maybe 3-4).  Those were very slight -- only disconcerting in that I wasn't sure if they were about to get worse.<br>  <br>  If you really want to do some research, check the link below.  I used to check up on them after I felt them.<br>  <br>  That second 'big' earthquake I mentioned, was actually in Niigata 2007 -- I'm not sure if it made the news in the US, but it was big news in Japan because it resulted in some damage to a nuclear power plant, with some radioactive cooling water leaking.  I felt at least three aftershocks following that one.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	On a WEEKLY basis, there are less than one. Earthquakes are common, but they are not quite THAT common.<br>  <br>  Once every month or every two months an earthquake occurs, but they are not always in Tokyo. Many are closer to (or in) the Kansai area.<br>  <br>  Some earthquakes aren't even noticeable. Most are just enough to wake you from your sleep. If your story is a day-to-day account, then you won't need to mention them that often, unless you are planning to write about a devastating earthquake or something.|`|m5fuOGAiaa	If an earthquake happens in Japan, 9 times out of 10 it is too small or too far away to feel it in Tokyo.<br>  <br>  In August and September I felt three and I havn't felt any between then and now and those two were just enough to make you stop for 3 seconds and hope it won't be a big one.<br>  <br>  That one in the summer of 2007 was kind of scary for someone who had never been in an earthquake before.  The building I was in was making alot of noise and it lasted a while.  It wasn't that scary when it was happening but I woke up at night sometimes thinking there was another one but it was just my heartbeat.  But thats just because it was my first earthquake.  At the center (far from Tokyo) stuff fell from shelves and there was that small nuclear scare mentioned by a previous answer
PSiNv7gUaa	The best thing for your aunt to do is talk to her doctor about the trip.  The doctor would be the one who could tell her any risks involved, any precautions that could be taken, and discuss the advisability of taking such a trip.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Ask her doctor.  A low white blood cell count is not necessarily a problem. A low red blood cell count might impact her ability to remain oxygenated at altitude and could involve more restrictions.  But her doctor will know for sure.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	She will be permitted onto the aircraft.
