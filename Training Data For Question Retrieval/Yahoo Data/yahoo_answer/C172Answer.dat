62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I think you should call the Dr. back before you do anything. Also, tell the Dr. that you do not want to wait a long time for an appointment with a specialist. Sometimes they seem to make you wait forever. Good luck. I'm one who really knows how you feel.|`|SUT3yL0oaa	Do not start the pills! Wait on the specialist! I know waiting sucks, but the hormones in bc pills can mess up any testing the specialist may want to do. There are also other meds to bring on your period than bc, provera being one of them.  <br>  Trust me, waiting to talk to the specialist will be well worth it. My hubby and I tried for 3 years to conceive with no luck. I sought help in june and bam with the drs help was pregnant by august.|`|GWveqx61aa	id try vitex, you can get it at a vitamin/health food store, it helps regulate your period, i heard that it basically turns into what you are lacking, ask the store where you buy it if that is true, i took it last mont, but after ovulation i stopped it, good luck and baby dust to you|`|AX4UCrEfaa	wait for the reply. thats why they are specialists cause they specialize in that field.
cY8DgJv5aa	lol  Then start at the top instead from now on.  I always started with the first snap at the top of the outfit (closest to their neck) then worked my way down.  It was when I got to the snaps that went down each leg that I generally got mixed up.  I wouldn't say that "EVERY TIME" I fastened them I ended up with an extra button, but it probably happened 50% of the time.  lol  Perfectly normal.  That's why I preferred the long night gown things instead.  No snaps, easy to get in and out of and kept baby very warm.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Ha ha just wait until they start walking, and you pretty much have to chase them around the button their clothes, sometimes I find myself saying "oh well" and my son runs around with lop sided pants on. Start from the top, it helps.|`|4yUUUkAsaa	lol I do this all the time! I swear Einstein would have trouble figuring out some of my daughter's outfits!

BUOJJpaCaa	My brother was having sex at 14/15 so I'm glad that you are not doing that.<br>  <br>  Dry humping is safe and is recommended as an alternative to sex because it is completely safe.<br>  <br>  I don't think you're too young. People are maturing earlier and earlier (hence the number of teenage pregnancies skyrocketing!) so I'm glad you are being safer and having fun.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with it. Have fun!|`|5tqh0akYaa	i think that's too much for 14 years old.

UwsbuHZYaa	Go to the emergency room immediately! What are you waiting for.|`|stv1JMXNaa	Bring her to the doctor as soon as you can. It would probably be better to bring her to a clinic thats open all night or to the emergency room at the hospital. If she's hotter, she has a fever, and puking up a lot isn't normal, especially through her nose.|`|UriE3wN6aa	GET TO THE FRIKKIN HOSPITAL???

Could your baby be constipated?|`|JUk8Hih0aa	Give her some tylenol and put a cool wet rag on the back of her neck to help calm the throw up. Make sure you sanatize once you clean it all up. In the morning call the doctor. Try to give her as much fluids as possible. Yes she may throw up but keep trying. The rag should help her feel a little better and don't hesitate to put her in the bath. I know I did that with my two and myself when I feel like crap and it helps calm it down some. Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL..who doesn't throw up through their nose when they are really sick? It's ok...don't let these other morons scare you. I have two kids that have been threw it and have been working in child care for four years. I also have medical knowledge from school and have spent study hours in pediatricians offices. <br>  <br>  Do not panic. There are lots of stomach things going around. If your daughter lays awake unresponsive then take her to the ER right away. Unresponsive I mean doesn't cry, doesn't look when trying to acknowledge her, so forth.|`|AA12296251	It sound like she might have a virus. Take her to the emergency room if her temp goes too high.

96HWpdkFaa	After 3 to 5 minutes the test is not accurate. So it was a negative. If you want test again tomorrow. Good luck.|`|54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	You need to test again with first morning urine because it will have the highest levels of HCG. That long for it to turn positive may not be accurate, there is a time limit on how long to trust the results. Good luck.|`|sJXjzgh5aa	first of all...<br>  take tests in the morning.<br>  <br>  secondly, <br>  after 10 minutes, results on the test are void.  so dont read it after 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  i took a test a week ago and my boyfriend fished it out of the trash and practically had a heart attack.  i had taken in a few hours earlier and the line was super dark.  <br>  <br>  retest tomorrow or sometime in the next few days and remember to read it like 2 minutes after and then thats it!<br>  <br>  congrats!<br>  <br>  oh and i heard that if you have even the faintest blue line, then you can be preggers.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	You can't really trust the results after 10 minutes.  Once the test starts to dry, you can get what is called an evaporation line.  It's a very faint, barely there line and tends to look more gray.  Actual positive lines will have color to them.  I would suggest you get another test and test in the morning.  The more concentrated your urine is, the more hcg the test has to read.  Good luck!  :)|`|7xit1ogxaa	You need to retest. After ten minutes the result is invalid. Once the urine has dried many tests will develop an evaporation line.|`|NcHsbFXhaa	I would test again|`|qE6BlyCFaa	it could be an evaporation line or maybe you just didnt watch for the result long enough..<br>  <br>  i think you should test again first thing in the morning and watch the result window for the fulll time it says you can wait and then throw it away and dont look at it again.<br>  <br>  It may still be too early soo just keep testing if your period doesn't show!<br>  <br>  goodluckk =] i hope it all works out how u want|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	I had that happen with a Clear Blue pregnancy test.  I wasn't pregnant at that time.  Unless the line shows up within the designated time period (usually 10 minutes) it is a negative.  That doesn't necessarily mean that you're not pregnant.  Wait for 2 days and take one with your morning urine.|`|MHeOHOnbaa	test again and on the box after ten minutes of taking the test any result that you get is void and the breast hurting is a sign of ovulation|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Agree with sweet test again and do it first thing in the morning, if it happens again, go to the doctors and have them do a blood test, they can tell that weeks before your period is due!|`|4VIjILk1aa	Take another test. My friend took a pregnancy test and it turned out like that so she went to go take another test and it was positive.

If he's mr. right, he should understand and be very supportive!<br>  Good luck :)|`|P8maveryaa	If you know that he would say no, then you need to reconsider whether he is the man for you or if he just wants to wait until you are married and older (the responsible, mature thing to do...) then you better wait.  If you get pregnant on purpose against his wishes then you are a horrible person and are not ready for an honest mature relationship.|`|SvmdIG9xaa	I'm 25 and I have been with my 22 year-old bf for 5 years. I am so ready to be pregnant. I dream about it, i want it. but I know that we are not financially stable right now and he doesn't want kids now. But I understand what it's like to what something like that so bad you're not sure what to do. I won't get pregnant on purpose, but I want to :)|`|qCvzu1wRaa	This will be hard for you, but can you try to hold off your sexual urge until you get married? You will feel better challenging yourself for holding off the urge until marriage, and it will all be worthwhile! <br>  But the question is, do you have the willpower to do hold off? No. That's where I hope you turn to Christ, the one who saved your soul, and ask him to give you the strength to be faithful to him and your boyfriend! Christ will listen and answer your prayers! They don't always turn out as expected, but you must trust him to work things out. He'll comfort you and guide you on the right path, because he's meets us where we're at. I mean, he could've not come down to earth in human form to die on the cross for our souls, but he did! Why? Because he loves us and wants to meet us where we are, so why not thank him and thank God for sending him down to save our souls. I mean, how would you like to find out your purpose was to die for all mankind, and not even being sure that the plan would work? Now all we have to do is follow and trust in him. If Christ could do all this for us then I'm sure you can hold off your sexual urge if you trust in and follow him.<br>  I'll be praying for you!
g9vw4ovGaa	Low back cramps are really commen in women that are pregnant. There are women out there that always get false negatives, has something to do with hip balance. Go to the doctor and have blood drawn, its faster and cheaper.

I would masturbate.  The contractions of the uterus help to bring along your period.  Good luck!
sJXjzgh5aa	i heard that a man doesnt become a father until the baby is born while a woman becomes a mother at the first feeling of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  my mom almost left my dad cuz he never cared when she was pregnant but he finally got on his game and that was 21 years ago!<br>  <br>  leave baby clothes and baby stuff around so he realizes its for real and you're not just playing house|`|YKeF3FyBaa	He might be scared.<br>  My husband was the same way.<br>  Well we lived together, but he just kind of always went out to do things while I was pregnant.<br>  He finally told me that he was excited to have the baby and everything, but he was just scared that he would never be able to leave the house once he got here.<br>  Talk to him about it.|`|MHeOHOnbaa	it sounds like he only wants a girlfriend part time and that he only wants to be with you when he is ready talk to him express how you feel|`|k4AbeiS8aa	i think u should let it go but next time talk to him about it i mean maybe he made plans a long time ago i mean this is the first time that he has done this|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You aren't showing yet.  It will take him a while to figure it out.  You should have just gone to sleep.|`|qCvzu1wRaa	If it turns out he just doesn't want to talk to you alone, then don't count on him helping you with the baby. Even if you guys did it before marriage a new life is a blessing and he'd be a jerk for not partaking in that! Unfortunately, you'd be the one to suffer.<br>  It could be that he's insecure about becoming a father! I'd ask one of his good friends to encourage him in becoming a father, and that he must accept it! It could be that he feels guilty and that the baby will seem like a burden to him emotionally. He's feeling the consequences of making the mistake of having sex before marriage and it's right of him to feel that way. However, him trying to avoid the consequences will make him feel worse. So please, ask one of his good friends to encourage him in becoming a father because a new life is a blessing and he should partake in raising the blessing. I'll be praying for you!

AOvtRBU9aa	stop pumping, stop supplementing and put him on your breast very very often! make sure you eat well.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Make sure you are eating enough as well as drinking the water, very important!  a baby takes 500 calories from you a day so you might need to eat more, if you are dieting put it off for a while. Keep putting him on to feed, alot.   Stress, which all new moms have REALLY effects your supply so try and relax, get as much rest as you can.  You can talk to a lactation consultant in your area, they might be able to help you, or if there is a La Leche league in your area.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, i hope it works out for you.|`|AA11540024	let some warm water run over your boobs and massage em. Let your baby breastfeed instead of pumping.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Have you ever had any breast surgery done?<br>  Do you take any medication?<br>  Did your breast change during pregnancy - breast become larger, aerola become darker, Montgomery spots appear around your areola?<br>  If you answered no to the first 2 questions and yes to the last question then here is your answer...<br>  You need to put the baby to the breast. This is the best way to increase milk supply. Have the baby nurse off from your breast every 2-3 hours. Because your supply is decreased you may need to supplement afterwards (Number one rule - baby must eat). After the baby finishes nursing from you for 20 minutes then if he is still hungry you can give formula. Then pump each breast for 10 minutes. Do this after ever feeding. Make sure that you are using a hospital grade double pump. Relax, drink about 8 - 8 ounce glasses of water a day, eat oatmeal twice a day. If you put a 100% effort in this then your milk supply will come back quickly. If your milk supply isn't increased in 72 hours you could try using some herbs such as Mothers Tea, fenugreek, or blessed thistle. <br>  Do NOT compare your milk supply to what you are pumping. Pumps are not the best thing in the world to determine milk supply. Many women have great milk supply but can hardly get any out when using a pump.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	nothing empties your breast better than a baby. make sure that your baby is properly latched and actually emptying your breast before switching sides so that it will refill. if your baby misses a feeding from you make sure you pump. if your supply is still down talk to his pediatrician about taking fenugreek. It's about $6 for 100 pills at any vitamin or health food store. 2 in the morning and 2 in the evening will help your milk supply. You'll know that its working when your sweat and urine smell like maple syrup, about 3 days later. It's not attractive but it's worth it to keep up your milk. Once your supply is up you can discontinue unless your supply dips again. In the meantime avoid caffeine, parsley, mint, and thyme. These all are used by mothers to dry up when they wean their babies. Try your local La Leche League for one on one help.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I had the same problem with my daughter.  It's hard but you need to start pumping every 2-3 hours during the day, plus pumping every feeding.  It worked for me,  at first I only got an ounce or so after pumping but it will started to build up:)  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Supplementing always hurts your supply.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Put the baby on your breast.It's the best for you both.|`|CbkQEek4aa	There's not much else you can do. Some people just don't make enough. I sure didn't. With my first child, I fed her fine from breast alone for maybe 5 days. After that it got harder and harder then I just couldn't do it. Then I started "drying up" before I even made the decision to. And I drank water. Some people just aren't made to breast feed. The important thing is, you tried. Not enough women can say as much. Just switch to formula.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	Feed your baby every two hours and after you get done feeding the baby try to pump then. You will not get any milk out right away but if you keep doing this you will produce more. Also drink a lot of milk and juices with your water through out the day. I have the same problem with my daughter. A bit of advice do not give him a bottle. I gave my girl a bottle and she had nipple confusion it took me a week to get her back on the breast. I had to feed her out of a medicine dropper until she would latch back on. GL.|`|edffl6oDaa	FEED FEED FEED! I was the same. I was so distraught as my babe was feeding every hour and I felt like I had nothing to give. But the best thing you can do is keep him on your breast. It takes about one week for your body to recognize the change in demand. Also its likely he is having a growth spurt. Just let him suck as much as he wants if your nipples are fine (make sure he latches properly) I know it is such hard work, but it will pay off.Thats what I did and now my  breasts are very full at every feed and she feeds every 2 hours! Stop pumping and giving formula, that will decrease your supply.<br>   <br>  Good luck - and dont give up!!|`|eRyCzwMcaa	I concur with Peyton's mommy.

When I was talking to you last you were 20 something weeks!<br>  <br>  How are you!?!<br>  <br>  They do say fetal movements decrease in the days coming up to birth - However, at work - they tell ladies to come in - even if decreased movements have only been noted for a few hours... All you would need is a quick CTG, you should be in and out within an hour.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your labour!! I am jealous hehehe xxxxxx|`|46K4FtE0aa	Don't forget there is very little room in there now and as she is moving ito position for the birth, she will have even less room to move, so stop prodding and poking her, LOL.

I wouldn't worry too much about it. Try drinking 2 large glasses of water and then lying on your side for a bit. That should stimulate some movement.|`|abBAUOo9aa	I think u should inform ur midwife/doctor about the decrease of baby movements.

My first 2 weren't even a year apart and my 4th and this baby will be about 12 1/2 months apart. You'll get through it, I think we all learn how to adapt with what we are given. One thing I do is require words because the whining gets on my nerves so much. Teach your daughter some sign language if she can't speak it yet and once you know she is capable of asking in simple terms, require that of her. It will reduce tantrums in the long run. We all have rough times, even with just one, and I am sure you have learned tricks with your first. You will continue to learn as you go and everything will be fine.|`|79kPBWMnaa	I have 2 girls, a 4 year old and a 3 month old.

nTQghH34aa	just sit her and the other girl down and tell them that is not right and tell them not to do it anymore.She is only 6 it's not like she knows what lesbian and gay mean so give her a break she dosen't know it's wrong.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	why does this bother you? And why do you refer to a child loving her friend and showing it as "CAUGHT"..youre ridiculous|`|ZncV5gc0aa	Kids will be kids. It's not as big of deal as people make it out to be because they don't know better at that age but do talk to her about it's inappropriateness. My son kissed a girl on the playground and you know the reason he told me? Because other kids kept telling them to so they did it.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Ask her why she's kissing her.<br>  She might not realize that kissing a girl is the same as kissing a boy. <br>  Or that kissing is an intimate thing.<br>  You should also have a talk with her about how she shouldn't be kissing people period, and that there are better ways to say hello, or say we're friends. Like hugging, holding hands, dancing, etc. <br>  I wouldn't want to go into the gay/lesbian thing - that might scar her if in fact she's having crushes on these girls. <br>  But little kids do experiement sometimes with those things in kindergarden and first grade - the whole show me yours & i'll show you mine, and the play doctor routine - which is all normal behavior in little kids.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Video it....I'm sure there are a lot of guys who'd pay mucho dinero for that actioon.....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously, are you worried because she's six and kissing another kid or is it b/c they're both girls???<br>  <br>  Explain to her that kissing and hugging is ok, but that the school has a rule about that during school ( my kids does) so, she shouldn't be doing it during school time.<br>  <br>  <br>  only in private<br>  <br>  <br>  with the cameras rolling<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  kidding.|`|OFdCY2Owaa	That's probably a sign of too much television or she might not know what she's doing. Of course, you should tackle this problem now before it gets out of hand. Sit down and have a serious talk with her.|`|rNvXWMOMaa	for Gods sake she's 6yrs old..<br>  little girls do such things.|`|wpCgpSHQaa	Well, first of all, you should ask your daughter why she was kissing a girl... and you have to understand that there is a possibility that she is a Lesbian. Be more open and think straight because your daughter may be scared of what you may think of her. If she is not a Lesbian than you should ask her why she was kissing a girl this time and last time. If your daughter tells you that she is a lesbian, try not to freak out and try not to be afraid and scared because she is your daughter and you'll have to accept her for who she is... Also give her your support and and make sure she is happy... I hope this helps.|`|d562233190ac48d1a2d453e8d8e8d61faa	Don't panic Mom. If you act like this is a big deal, then she will too. She is a child, and you should be glad that she is a loving affectionate child. I would simply tell her that you are glad that she like this little girl, but she doesn't have to kiss her in order to let her know that she likes her. Tell her that you kiss her, because she is your baby and that you love her, but there are different kinds of love and different ways of showing affection for people. I'd suggest that maybe they give each other a hug hello and goodbye, instead of kisses. Keep a smile on your face and make the talk light-hearted!|`|drzkJ9ouaa	take it easy ....it's quite normal for the children at this age to be experimental..she is quite small to understand what is socially approved or not..just make her sit and speak to her ..it may take aome time for her to understand ..but be patient..remember hoe inquisitive and experimental we were as we were too growing up..|`|lbIPaegGaa	In my opinion i think you should let your daughter experience many things so that she is able to learn,the reason is because if you say something your daughter might start holding secrets thus ruining your realationship with her.|`|QPMpGjLRaa	she probably doesnt know wat shes donig.she probably got the idea from watching tv and wanted to try it out.  just talk to her and let her know how u feel about it. and maybe talk to the other girls mom|`|7XBoIgd6aa	It's normal for young children to experiment....or "play doctor" If your concerned ask your doctor.<br>  <br>  To Cris she is 6 years old for gods sakes...she doesn't even know what that is!!!!!
MHOxPs8Oaa	They sure can, my husband's family had to with his little brother because of all the stuff he was doing and they couldn't do anything to help him. Why they can make them is because they are in control of what their kids do.  With my husband's little brother it was the best thing that ever happened to him.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If parents can afford a boot camp, yes, they can send their kids to boot camp.<br>  <br>  Why? because their parents said so.|`|YbEQ8Wv5aa	yes, they can but the results are often just temporary. it scares the kids into better behavior but after they get home a majority of the kids start acting out worse than before. if you remember those shows on tv, the kids were all wonderful and great at the end but EVERY SINGLE ONE had awful results within a year.<br>  <br>  they decided to have the child, they obviously havent done a good job so far, don't just send it away because you srewed up. finish what you started.<br>  <br>  if my parents sent me to bootcamp i would temporarily act like a little angel to get out of there but i'd end up resenting my parents so bad afterward, i would run away and never speak to anyone from my area again.|`|sUSfQ9AZaa	Yes they can, and the minor child has no choice.<br>  <br>  Also, sounds like this is what she needs NOW before she ends up going way down the wrong road|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Sadly yes they can make a kid go to bootcamp some needed & other nots but i blame misbehaving children on bad parenting|`|8EUtaXcdaa	If the child is a U.S. minor, the parent can forcefully send their child to boot camp.<br>  <br>  I think more parents need to exercise that authority nowadays :P|`|15423591314a80b690eb6deb8aaebcb4aa	As long as the child is young enough to be in custody of their parents (under 18, unless emancipated) Yes, a parent can sign them up for bootcamp.  Although, I would reserve this for extreme behavior, such as drug use, theft and property destruction.  The option is the parents, the child cannot say no to it without resorting socialservices, even then socialservices is most likely going to be on the parents side.|`|QsbYcxjiaa	they have to go and i want to join the marines and my parents are thinking bout sending me to boot camp i think but hey im not joign when im 18 gonna try to get into a military college|`|vAN97azHaa	Parents most certainly can force their children to go. It's legal because children technically do not have rights until they turn 18, parents are responsible for them till then too.

Maybe later on he will be fine with it. She is going to get changed one way or the other.|`|19JRf8Cxaa	Tell him that you will pay him a dollar every time he helps change his sisters diaper.

Given a choice over coffee & tea before I was pregnant I would've always chose tea, but I didn't drink it that often. When I got pregnant, one of my major cravings was hot tea & butter toast. Yum, my mouth is watering thinking about it now lol. Anyway, b/c I want it every day, I switched to decaf tea & have it w/ my butter toast nearly daily. I can't taste the difference. Also, a cup of coffee a day is fine. I'd wait until after your first trimester though, just to be safe.|`|sYsfI856aa	Juice, smoothies, yogurt drinks? I'm not sure what sort of things you like, but those are what I've switched over to they taste good and are good for you!<br>  <br>  Also try flavored waters, or even if you don't like tea... try Chai tea, it's really good!

I know many people think it's bland, but you can add lemon or lime or any other fruit to it to make it more interesting.  <br>  <br>  Caffeine is actually ok in moderation.  It's recommended to not drink more than a cup a day.  The current finding with caffeine is the more you consume it, the higher the risk of miscarriage in the first trimester.  Through out pregnancy, for every glass or cup you drink of a caffeinated beverage, you need to at least match it with a cup or glass of water.  (Caffeine dehydrates you and can increase your risk or preterm labor, especially during the summer months)|`|eryJKCpfaa	I know its hard! i too was a 2 cup a day coffee drinker.

I guarantee it will be WELL worth your time.<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you don't like the search engines at your high school, you could go to a major university web site, find their library home page, and use their search engines.

24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	The symptoms for pms and pregnancy are very similar so it's hard to really say. The only way to really know is to wait and see if you miss your period and then take a test.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	You could be you just need to take a test, you wouldnt be having a round belly already it would be too soon so i wouldnt say that would have anything to do with it and a strange feeling in the stomach doesnt normally happen untill later on but cramping does happen during pregnancy especially around the time u would be due your period.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Take a test, no one on here can tell you. It could be PMS or pregnancy symptoms.|`|Mp9SaP1iaa	It sounds like. The brown bleeding you had could be implantation bleeding it doesn't have to be pink and last just a couple days.<br>  If you think had implantation bleeding take the test 3-4 days after it has finished. If you don't think it is you can wait a while and take a blood test about 5 days before your expected period or take a ept on or day after your expected period. Or you can wait until your next period and see if it comes but many of us women seem to hate the 2 week wait but that's all we can do.  <br>  Good Luck :o)|`|JW0qV2cZaa	Hi, I am the official gyno for Yahoo Answers.

9Jnf5jRQaa	I'm sure you've heard this a hundred times, but I believe it's true.  Everything happens for a reason.  There was a reason that your body rejected that fetus.  There could have been something wrong where if it did go full term, there could have possibly been something wrong with the baby.  I also believe that your baby hasn't died.  It's a soul that is just waiting to be born, and that body that it was in - just wasn't the right one.  I know it's hard, but you have to trust your body to know what it's doing and the time will come when everything is perfect and you will have a successful pregnancy.  Sorry for your loss - but don't lose hope.|`|dVAiuqZCaa	Most of the time a miscarriage happens because there is something seriously wrong with the baby.I had one 10 years ago and I got through it by thinking whatever was wrong could have been more than I could've handled.Now 10 years later I have 3 healthy children and I occasionally think what that child would've been like but I don't get sad about it,I'm really thankful for the ones I have.If you can't get past it on your own,get some professional help.Good Luck.|`|056jAUjjaa	I would definitely discuss this with a partner, therapist, or even another woman.

Miscarriage gives you a feeling of hopelessness, sadness and guilt.  Here is what i suggest you can do. Join a support group that is  going through the same experience as you. Book yourself in for a  consultation with  a life coach specialising in NLP. The coaching session will allow you to cope more easily by o tapping into your personal powers. A life coach can also help existing pregnant women who are having difficulty coping with pregnancy. Thirdly, I would advice practicing meditation or listening to hypnotic cd or MP3  on pregnancy if you are pregnant or on coping with loss. Check my website (www.marysefelicite.com) for information on life coaching or contact me.  Having experience loss in the past.  Now i know that i would have been able to cope better had i known something about NLP (Neuro Linguistic programming) coaching.|`|w2uktQyBaa	I would talk it out with my partner and maybe you should speak to a professional.

d8fG3NUdaa	According to the pamphlet given to me by Planned Parenthood, the risk of pregnancy with just a condom can be as high as 15%.  Not to scare you or anything.  Going on the pill is the most reliable method, where with perfect use, your chance of pregnancy is less than 1%.  It's better to be double protected.  What I mean by double protected is that both of you use a form of contraceptive.  For example, my boyfriend uses a condom each time and I'm on the pill and never miss a day.  So if you use double protection your chances of having a baby are very close to 0%.  Best of luck.|`|MkchPOjFaa	umm yea...your wearing a condom so yea i cant you have any chance of gettin pregnant unless 1) its broken already 2) he takes it off...and the fact that your asking means your tooo young to even be having sex...and too young to be on birth control cause you dont want your parents to find out|`|HQyVeaPPaa	go to this link: <a href="http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/malecontraceptives1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngwomenshealth.org/malecon...</a><br>  <br>  basically, it says 14 out of ever 100 couples who only use a condom will end up pregnant|`|0xiHNsmVaa	“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.”-Einstein|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	you will be fine unless condoms break|`|gfDwARzaaa	depends...if you're willing to risk the possiblity of the condom maybe slipping off during intercourse, or possibly maybe even breaking. So you have pretty much a 50/50 risk. 50% chance of nothing happening, and 50% chance that something MIGHT happen. So just becareful!! Thankfully you're at least using a condom! That's a plus.

nrqWwQBXaa	depends where you live. yes that is a really good idea in washington i paid 100 dollars just for a small leaf clover. so hope fully the tattoo wont cost a bunch of money. you could call and ask how much it might cost. it could cost any where from 100-400?|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I absolutely hate tattoos because our bodies change so they change too.  I think it's a good idea though, but do it on your ankle because a lot of people don't like hiring people for jobs if they have tattoos showing. You can probably go into a tattoo place and get an average of about how much they would charge.<br>  <br>  Haha why am I getting thumbs down? I gave real answers. Even though I hate tattoos I still gave real advice.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If you don't want to do the norm, how about a portrait of their faces?

I am thinking that something with ice skating and a girl holding a little boys hand would be too big for a wrist...also, over time the ink can blur.<br>  <br>  Not trying to discourage you or anything lol I just know that as you get older, the tat changes with you.<br>  <br>  If you are really down for this, go to a local tatoo place and ask them about this.I'm sure they will be more than willing to help you.|`|2pxiK9waaa	It'd be several hundred dollars if they could do it at all. For a first tattoo, the ankle or wrist is not the place to go. It also sounds way too intricate for something as small as you want it to be. There's no way that'd fit in either place. In order to fit all of that in, they'd have to do a HUGE area of skin.|`|BRT2teSqaa	I agree with the first answer totally.  Nice idea and sentiment but wont work on the ankle or wrist.  Something that detailed needs a very large area like the back.|`|qRElKKjXaa	I think it sounds sweet and sentimental, but you might want to rethink the location. My boyfriend recently got a tattoo and the artist said that it freaking hurts like crazzzzzzzzzzzzy to get it on your wrist or tattoo any other area with such little padding. Maybe on your forearm, upper arm, calf or back would be better. Also, if you wanted to cover it up it would be easier there.<br>  <br>  This is what my boyfriend's dad told him when he said he wanted to get a tattoo on his 18th birthday: find the idea for the tattoo, go ahead and see the artist and get it sketched up (you'll pay for the time of course) and then hang the sketch on your wall and look at it every day for a year. Show it to the people important to you. If you aren't sick of it after a year get the tattoo. This will be on your body for life unless you want to pay a fortune to undergo painful laser removal. Make absolutely sure that it's what you are going to be happy with.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  Two things to add: there is a section just for tattoos here, and you'll get way more info from people down with the idea of one there. <br>  <br>  Secondly, no offense to the other answerer, put please do not get your children's faces tattooed on you. They may think it's awesome now, but they'd be morified when they're teenagers. I'm 17 and I would so totally be. I'd be cool with my parents having a really beautiful, special tattoo that wasn't too big or flashy, though.|`|FfNjsqGvaa	With tatoos, anything goes. So go for it if it is something you will still value when you are older and wrinkler. As for it fitting, it depends how big or small you make it. They can make it work for you, I am sure. They will draw it out for you and adjust the sizing. As for how much, I can't say. You are looking at 100-300 probably (I don't think it would be 300)|`|hRZFLRHLaa	I think it is a good idea.  I have always wanted to get a tattoo that had something to do with my kids.  I would say get it around the ankle.  As for price every place is different.  I got a small butterfly on my back a few years back and that cost 80 dollars.  Probably be over a 100 dollars.|`|PuQyYMM8aa	I think it sounds unique and cute. I have never seen anything like that before.

Very pretty girl name..|`|xpUyH0psaa	kylie grace not only because it flows better but it is also more of a girl name and sounds good with landon.|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Taylor :)<br>  beautiful|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I like Kylie Grace.
MW18liqTaa	Yes. I did when I was pregnant.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	its normal to feel like you love your baby already and your partner doesnt. Remember your forming a bond already because its inside of you. Men usually form bonds with the babies after they are born some women are lucky and it starts before that, but in general dont worry its normal|`|fMnzjULCaa	Yes, I've been in love w/ mine since that first positive pregnancy test. Don't be too hard on your husband though. I don't really expect much from them. If anything, I think they should love us more seeing what we are going through. But could you imagine if the tables were turned? I was just thinking that the other day. I would hate it if our baby was in his body & not mine! I'd feel so left out! I wanted this baby SO much but I did not actually love him until he was in my body. I knew I would love him & that I wanted him so much, but the true love did not show itself until that "positive". I just don't think it's possible for our husband's to love the baby as much as us until they are born. That's my opinion though.|`|dPgP28Aiaa	I love my baby like it's already born. I'm 14 weeks pregnant, and my boyfriend doesn't love it as much as I do, I know that for a fact. I guess it's a mother thing, because you're actually carrying the baby, you have more of a bond with it than the father does. You get to bond with the baby before it's born, the father's bonding doesn't start until after the baby's born.|`|GLJkGgloaa	I am only 4 weeks pregnant and my husband doesn't talk about "It".<br>  He found out that were or I was pregnant, Said O Ok and is in his own little world now.<br>  He is still numb..He is excited but I guess can't show it.<br>  He didn't expect me to get pregnant so fast.<br>  <br>  I love my baby. I started a Journal for my baby and I write in it every night.<br>  I talk to the baby telling the baby how much I love him or her.<br>  How much that I want the baby to be happy and How I being a mommy is exciting.|`|62vCoDPjaa	of course!  im pregnant with my first, and although we werent expecting to have a baby this soon, we are still thrilled to death.  i was one of those people that always said i didnt want kids, and now that i am 32 weeks and have only 2 months to go, i am soooo excited!  my husband is great, he rubs on my tummy all the time...kisses it..and talks to our little girl like she is already here!|`|wzXJOSIeaa	A woman becomes a mother when she finds out she's pregnant.<br>  <br>  A man becomes a father when he see his child for the first time.|`|AA12395149	It's very common for the man to not feel as attached to the pregnancy as the woman.  He isn't experiencing the symptoms like you are.  The pregnancy probably won't become very "real" to him until you start showing.  Even then, when he fantasizes about the baby, he'll more likely be seeing a child of 3 years or older rather than a baby. <br>  <br>  You can help him to enjoy this pregnancy more by encouraging him to join you at doctor's visits, talk about the pregnancy and start shopping/looking for baby stuff.  When you start to feel the baby move, but the movements aren't strong enough to feel outside of the womb, describe what you are feeling to him.  However, not all men are the same, and he may get irritated if you focus on the pregnancy too much.  Basically, you have to figure out what makes your guy tic and go with that.<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats!|`|eryJKCpfaa	its different for men, Especially when you are that early on in your pregnancy. Yes, you have the symptoms of being pregnant, but you are not showing, Its prob has not hit him yet that your really pregnant. It didn't hit me that i was really pregnant till i went in for my ultrasound at 20 weeks!|`|7xit1ogxaa	Well, it is a little harder for the guys because they aren't the ones experiencing pregnancy. As you get further along and begin to show I think that it will become more real to him. Don't worry about it, it is perfectly normal for the guy to not be able to relate. Perhaps you could get him a copy of The Expectant Father to help him better understand and become more excited about the pregnancy.|`|3CG3rby0aa	yep i am 25 weeks and i love my baby alot already.  look forward to holding her in my arms and all the crap i have gone threw has been worth it. :)  my husband loves my baby but it took awhile for him to get used to it.|`|IPsjE9Rpaa	Yea i forget a few times. My fiancee is 17 weeks preg and she is showing now and i talk to her belly at night and kiss it goodnight but of course the baby can hear at how far she is along...|`|xPfJG3FGaa	if u love him/her now, wait til u feel him/her kick, but yes i love my baby soooooooooooooooo much already too, but i am almost due, march 10th, thank god, can't wait!|`|J9Vmueauaa	It's called a mother and child bond.<br>  <br>  it is beautiful :)|`|Vm0k6MfJaa	It's harder for the dad to connect to the growing baby...I actually also had a hard time feeling love when my daughter was born. When she was in me I felt love for her but when she was born it was not this overwhelming feeling like other ppl describe. my husband said he felt that though when she was born. I grew to love my daughter and now this love is so amazing. It is different for everyone but it will eventually happen and I think its great you already feel that way.|`|3EiOobEVaa	Yes I think that is with every couple....In both of my pregnancies I felt a stronger connection with my babies way before my boyfriend did. But eventually my boyfriend did come around and I think he talked to my stomach and told both of us that he loved us everyday...so yes i felt this way|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I have 3 kids and I miscarried 1 @ 8 weeks last year. My husband was excited, but did he hug and kiss my belly constantly! NO.  He was happy. He would hug and tell me he loved. And I'm quite sure he forget I was pregnant when I would look like crap and got morning sickness and wasn't looking so hot. But that's how some men are. As long as you know he loves you and that sweet angel that's what matters. When it's born... you'll see the change in him when he carries the baby and looks into his eyes.  We love the baby because we can feel it each second as we fall asleep and the minute we wake up. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|znnEJCZ3aa	I had a miscarriage last June so every little cramp, pain or uneasy feeling i have I get thrown back into thinking something is wrong. I get so excited when I have my ultrasounds but the time between them is not so easy.  My pregnancy has been really really easy, no nausea or dizzy spells. I just wish I could get over the feeling that something is going to go wrong. My boyfriend on the other handd has been amazing! From the night I took the pregnancy test he comes home andHug'ss and kisses my belly. lol... He'll come home and before I even get a hi, he's wrapped around my waist saying "hi baby" lol... He's been really good and supportive with everything. Don't get me wrong, I love this baby I just wish I could get over my fears so that I can really be in love! =)

The funniest question I asked was in Science class: <br>  I go to an all girls private school and one of teachers (a man) made a quick announcement about robotics. At the very end of the announcement (our school has an email thing) he said : If you want to email me, I am the only Andrew in the school. Then I blurted: But we go to a co-ed school, aren't their other Andrew's? Everyone started to laugh at me. <br>  <br>  Another time was when I was younger, my mom was talking to my sister Michele. All of a sudden I stared straight at my mom and asked: "Mom, have you seen Michele?" After I had said hi to her! It was really sad|`|wWdMcbvGaa	Okay, this is the most recent, it happened last night.<br>  So some friends and i were at a dance last night and it was sooo hot in there even the walls were wet from everyone sweating so much, so we were on our way home and my friend Rachel was like "im totally taking a shower when i get home" and my friend chloe was like "me too" and my friend andrea who was in the car has a steam shower at her house and its kind of like a suana thing if you dont know what that is, and  Andrea was like "im going to bed its frickin 2 am" and i thought about it for a while and then i asked "Hey Andrea, can you take a steam shower but have it blow cold steam?" and then they all laughed at me and Andrea was like "sorry, Renee, thats not how steam works.<br>  haha|`|hOEIFpl5aa	i have alot of dumb questions i ask!!! but i cant think of any right now.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	My favorite one I will never forget or have my family forget about it.

dJx5eKx3aa	Walking:<br>  It has been suggested that walking can help ease the baby into the pelvis, thanks perhaps to the force of gravity or the swaying of your hips. Once your baby puts pressure on the cervix-literally-labor might just get going. If it turns out your stroll doesn't jump-start labor, you'll be no worse for the wear. In fact, you might be in better shape for labor, whenever it actually does begin. <br>  <br>  Foods to Bring It On:<br>  Hungry for labor? Ready to do-or eat- anything that might trigger that first real contraction? Though there's no science backing them up, plenty of old wives (or old friends) will tell you about a last supper that ended with a trip down labor lane. Among the often heard: If your stomach can take the heat, dip into something that gets your bowels-and hopefully your uterus-in an uproar (a crate of bran muffins chased down by a barrel of prune juice perhaps?) Not in the mood for something so stimulating? Some women swear by eggplant, tomatoes, and balsamic vinegar (not necessarily together); others say pineapple buys a ticket on the Labor Express. Whatever you dig into, remember that unless your body and your baby are ready to take the labor plunge, it's unlikely that dinner's going to pull the trigger. <br>  <br>  Before you try these at home, discuss them with your doctor first:<br>  Nipple Stimulation:<br>  Stimulating your nipples for hours (yes, hours) a day can release your own natural oxytocin and bring on contractions. Here's the caveat: Nipple stimulation-as enticing as hours of it may sound (or not)-can lead to painfully long and strong uterine contractions. So unless your practitioner advises it and is monitoring your progress, you might want to think twice. <br>  <br>  Herbal teas and remedies:<br>  Raspberry leaf tea, black cohosh-these herbal remedies might be just what your grandmother orders to bring on labor, but since no studies have been done to establish the safety of herbal treatments as labor inducers, don't use any without getting the green light from your doctor first.<br>  <br>  And FYI:<br>  Some research shows that semen (which contains prostaglandins) can stimulate contractions, while other research has found that women who continue to have sex late in pregnancy might carry their babies even longer than those who abstain.|`|9tvYuVzuaa	Hot Bath - body Stimulation (breast) - bumpy car ride <br>  <br>  I am a mom of 3. I was 2 cm for about the last 4 weeks and on night I rolled over and my water broke on its own. I was given Pitocin with my 3 births and I would not change a thing! It went quicker and the pain is not drown out for hours. All of my children I was given Pitocin and asked with my last born (8months now). I no Everyone is different, but with Pitocin, all of my children were born in 2 hours, labor and delivery. Why sit and wait for the pain. <br>  <br>        ALL OF MY CHILDREN WERE BORN WITH NO PAIN MEDS.|`|1EvcWbpgaa	i used castor oil. it's not as bad as it sounds. the contractions of your bowels start the contractions in your uterus. i have 3 castor oil babies. walking doesn't work. you could stand in one place and do the same amount of induction as you would walking. all that does is put pressure on the cervix to help dilation. orgasms can sometimes work. hope this helps. if not maybe at your next doctor appointment you could ask about going ahead and setting a date for an induction.|`|apSTH4TIaa	Nipple stimulation can bring on contractions, but you shouldn't do it without letting your doctor know about it.  As long as you are full term they should be ok with it.  I always have to have help to get into labor.  My doc always uses the MISO cervical gel to get things going and I go pretty fast once we do that.  I have had the membranes stripped which works for some, but didn't for me.  Walking, or I found bouncing lightly on one of those exercise ball was wonderful.  Good luck...:)|`|1YNhKzeqaa	Walking and raspberry leaf tea. Walking DOES work, I know someone who took a walk everyday and she almost went into labor too early and the doctor told her to stop walking so much. Raspberry leaf tea will help speed delivery along, I have talked to a few people who have had kids with and without raspberry leaf tea and there was a difference.|`|VS8mactUaa	Stimulating your nipples can bring on labor, so I've heard, if you really wanna try somthing try that, No ons wants sex when you're dialating :) not very comfortable. :) I wish you a quick and easy labor!|`|UcgWrGaAaa	I had heard black cohosh would work.  I'm guessing you can get it at your local health food store.  <br>  <br>  I'm thinking that if you take the right amount of castor oil it might not be so messy.  Also you may want to be cleaned out because some find it embarassing to poop on the table when pushing to get the baby out.<br>  <br>  EDIT- You might want to take a look at this there is just so much information there<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/natural-ways-to-induce-labor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/natu...</a>|`|AA11763588	If there was a sure fire way to self induce we'd all be doing it.

So if you have the baby's daddy handy, tell him it's time to help out!!<br>  <br>  At the same time, if you have an orgasm, I believe that will release some oxytocin in your body, which can also help bring on labor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Do you think that his parents are going to stop him from seeing your sister?<br>  That probably is not going to happen.<br>  <br>  What do your parents think of this situation?  The responsibility falls to them to set the rules and regulations for your sister, not you.<br>  <br>  Have you tried talking to your sister about your concern for this situation.  Remember, you get more flies with honey than you do vinegar.  You have to be willing to talk to your sister about your concerns without criticizing the bf in the process.  You might try addressing issues such as education, spending time with friends and family or finding a new activity to do together so that you can become closer.<br>  <br>  If you make yourself available for friendly conversation, then when she makes the decision to dump this guy, you will be the first person she will turn to.  If you are always angry and critical, she will cut you out of her life.  This may happen anyway if the situation is as critical as you think it is.  You have to be able to give advice and then step away and let the person decide if your advice is worth taking.  If they reject it, you have to find a way to still be friends.  This is very difficult to do.<br>  <br>  Above all, let your sister know that you love her.  I do believe that you stepped over the line by calling his parents.  I believe that you did it out of love and concern for your sister.  Not everyone will see it that way.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Nope.  You're in the wrong.

I'm a dancer too, and that has happened to me when I don't eat enough or don't drink enough water.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	yeah that's happened to me before when I haven't eaten or when i worked too hard. you just need food and water and sleep.|`|TQwkS4NVaa	yes, I ran for about 3 hours straight for volleyball with no water break. It was like 100 sets of lines or something, omigosh it was painful. But as soon as I was done, I got super dizzy, I couldn't breathe, and my vision went completely away. I thought I was dying, but when I talked to my mom(a nurse) she said it could've been because of the lack of water so dehydration is a probable cause. It's never happened again,because I told my coach and now we do like 4 hours of running but she lets me get water every hour or so, and it's alot better.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	YA! ... it was so messed ... i had been in the hot tub for like... 10 mins i went o get out ... i got down 2 stairs and i totally blacked out and couldn't see but all my other senses were fine ... thank god my friend was there i told her and she got me into cold water and my vision came back it was wierd.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	Yeah, that's happened to me before.

I don't like it with Matthew though, and I'm not a fan of Matthew either.  The two names have like the same "theme" though, I think, and that's why I like it.<br>  <br>  Chase Alexander is my favorite out of the three.  It's very masculine.

zoogh6guaa	i agree with the answer above... if you have not considered intrauterine insemination you may want to do so... in-vitro can range from $9000-$15000 per try... my husband and I decided to try intrauterine first - $605 total with the aid of chlomid and it worked on the first try... we had been trying for 5 years with no success <br>  <br>  good luck|`|21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	the price of the procedure and medication and testing all together can run anywhere from about $8,000 to $16,000 EACH time depending on what your doctor wants to do and the area you live in. <br>  <br>  We are trying IUI right now (a step lower than In Vitro) with aid of Clomid. With the clomid I am having horrible headaches and am very moody (worth it though!) My husband is military though so the treatment is free (for now... In Vitro is out of pocket)|`|8sJQP3Y4aa	The invitro clinic that I'm going to costs about $12,000 and an additional $2,000-$4,000 for meds.  I've started the labs but haven't started the medication yet.  Good luck to you and wish me luck too :)|`|syrh8J6Vaa	It depends on where you are at.  I am in california and it is roughly $10,000|`|QKGuNLb4aa	it depends on where you are and the clinic you use it also depends on the amount of meds you will require. i had one done in texas and it cost me 9000 plus the med which was about 3000. i had a good expeirance the shots arent as bad as people make them sound, but i have to tell you that mine didnt work out and that for me was very very very difficult<br>  i should tell you also that after your first cycle called a fresh cycle if you require another one it doesnt cost as much... 3000 for a frozen cycle plus the med.
qjzgQ8y5aa	You could use like double stick tape and stick them to your cieling so it looks like ur wallimg on ur ceiling.

Or try doing something with tying their laces together and arranging them. I don't think you'd have enough shoes but if you do your could try making a string curtain for your door.

VYMOwgc3aa	Since you'll only be 14, about $5 per hour is the maximum you should charge.<br>  <br>  As for reasonable hours, it really just depends on how much you want to babysit & for how long. Are there times when you just can't? Just babysit whenever you are able to. Would you be able to do overnight babysitting? Lots of people need it & are willing to pay extra for overnight care.<br>  <br>  I can't really tell you how many children you should take on because I don't know how busy your lifestyle is or how many you are willing to watch. Personally, I am able to watch kids at any time on any day so I spread my schedule out & plan ahead, but that might be different for you.<br>  <br>  What I did to find parents to babysit for was I posted an ad on Craigslist. I told them about myself & my availability. I let people know that I can work out rates & payments. Within a day I had woman contact me who needed overnight care for 5 children. I've been babysitting for her since December & earn $260 every three days. Pretty good for a 17 year old huh?<br>  <br>  Good Luck <3|`|MIgxkmIqaa	I started babysitting when I was about your age. I put up ads at local libraries in the childrens room to advertise my service. I had babysat for neighbors and family members before I started looking for a summer job. I would charge $10 an hour flat rate. You dont have much experience, so you dont want to turn away people. Or, when people ask you, ask them back "how much do you think is fair?" That way they can pay you what they think is right. You can decide the hours. If someone is looking for a full time sitter Mon thru fri maybe they want you to work 8am til 5pm. The hours all depend on your availability and the hours that the families need you to work. Just tell them up front that you are not available Wed and Fri nights. Thats fine. They cant expect you to drop everything for them!  To start out maybe have 2 kids. That way you are not overwhelmed. I am now 25 and think that 3 kids can be a handful!!! The question about how to attract people that have small children to allow you to babysit for them... On the ad that you put up say that you are able to care for children from 2 to 10 or whatever age you feel comfortable watching. <br>  Make the flyer look something like this but obvioulsy more happy and attractive:<br>  <br>  <br>  Kate's babysitting Services<br>  <br>  Hi my name is Kate. I am 25 years old and am certified by the american cross to babysit. I am looking for a babysitting job for the summer. I am very flexiable on my availability and would love to play with your children while you work or run a few errands! <br>  <br>  Please feel free to call me with any questions or schedule a time to meet! I look forward to hearing from you! 888-888-8888<br>  <br>                                                                     Thanks! <br>                                                                        Kate<br>  <br>  <br>  Then at the bottem write your name and number sideways and cut inbetween each one so that the person can rip it off and call you when they get home!!!<br>  GOOD LUCK!!!! HAVE FUN!!!!|`|MuFGfvBBaa	to answer the first question, when i did babysit i charged 5 dollars an hour, when there where 2 or less kids. 7 when there were 3+<br>  <br>  since it's over the summer I would say from 10AM going to about 12 midnight.<br>  <br>  for the first few months, I might suggest 3 or less children, that AREN'T babies.<br>  <br>  if there are parents in your neighborhood/street just talk to them and tell them that you DO babysit. be friendly and nice to both the parents and the children.<br>  <br>  *if possible, I would start out babysitting children of your parent's friends. also, you could be a 'mother's helper' before you actually babysit. oh and BTW the ARC babysitting program is amazing! good luck :]*|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	I say charge $3 dollars an hour.<br>  If you want to charge per kid though, charge a dollar a child.<br>  If you are working daytime go from Noon-4PM.<br>  Working nighttime: 5PM-10PM.<br>  For the first few months only stick with one child. Then after about 3 months or so try to take on two kids.<br>  Make flyer's and go door-to-door and hand them out. You could also post them around town. Also, go to places in your town with bulletin or advertising boards and ask if you can hang one of your flyer's.

AA10556677	Nope. The reason you keep thinking about this is because you keep looking at the ads for Atlantis that are telling you that you CAN'T have fun until you go. That's what marketing is. The best way to get over it is to stop looking at the internet sites and newspaper ads (they run them every day in The New York Times; that's where I see them).<br>  <br>  From personal experience, I can also tell you that resorts aren't very much fun unless you're with your family or friends. It would probably suck being there by yourself.|`|OFdCY2Owaa	Uh, I don't think they'll let you go to the bahamas by yourself. Ask your parents if a grandma or aunt could accompany you and be willing raise some of the money yourself.

1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter does this too.  I asked her doctor about it at 12 months and he said she would probably flatten both feet when she learned to walk.  She's now 18 months and isn't walking on her own yet, because she can't balance with one foot up and the other one flat.  We went back to the doctors about it this week and he is sending us to a pediatrician for it.  I would go to your doctors and ask about it.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Haha, my daughter does the same thing, she didn't do it at first but now she'll stand with one foot flat and the other on her tippy toes... its crazy and funny all at the same time. I had it checked and my doctor said it wasn't any reason to worry.|`|424kBOEYaa	my friends son did the exact thing. <br>  TAKE HIM IN ASAP! <br>  There can be serious things wrong and corective measures should be planned and executed now!!!!|`|XSol0H6Uaa	How long has he been doing it?  I would have it checked.
3CG3rby0aa	you can still ovulate without a period, i did and i am 25 weeks today.|`|AA11763588	Because you have to OVULATE before you get a PERIOD.<br>  <br>  You aren't going to know when you are ovulating after you give birth till you get your first period, then ovulate a second time.<br>  <br>  ETA:<br>  Well if you know that then your question makes no sense as you state and I quote:<br>  <br>  This confuses me! i don't understand how it happens. if you don't get a period, then you would not ovulate right?<br>  ------------<br>  <br>  So YOU obviously didn't know... so instead of saying no stupid answers how about saying no stupid questions.

meK1OKVvaa	Well, I was excited to go back to school because I'd get to see my friends again. Think positively. I think it would have been extraordinary for a 5 or 6 year old to think of applications of what's to come (like, "NOW I'll know how to be able to do this/fix this"... or "why this technique doesn't work"... or "now I can do it myself and not have to wait on others to get/do it for me"... or "this sounds much better than what i was doing before"... and eventually go to "why don't you do it this way, it's easier)." Kids these days just complain and quit when they think it's too hard; it's the people who challenge themselves or always try to do better who end up making the big bucks... (even the people who think outside the box to try to get around the system or above the rules). Sure a vacation is cool... but eventually, it could get boring because you'll run out of things to do. Going to school helps expose you to the world more because kids these days just stay indoors usually in front of a tv/computer/etc. How many times have you thought, "I never thought of that before...?"<br>  <br>  Also, regarding the bad feeling of what's to come... that's similar to holding a leash to a dog and that dog getting excited about going for a walk... or when you take a dog to the vet, it gets upset before it gets seen. When my chinchillas hear crinkling paper, they get really excited because they think they'll get a raisin (the raisins are in a packaged bag).|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	Actually it's pretty typical. I have known alot of kids who had no desire to start school. Alot of children don't get excited about it because they know their whole life is going to change.|`|W85IdGzvaa	It's totally normal! Actually, before my little brother entered first grade this past August, he told me he was only going to go for one month and then he was going to quit. I just pointed out all of the good things he would miss if he only went for one month, like the Christmas party, Valentine's party, recess, gym, art, etc. He "changed his mind" after one day that he would stay for two months. After a week, he decided he would stay all year.<br>  <br>  My advice is to point out one positive thing for every negetive thing he says. Also, ask him to keep an open mind and tell him the truth. Yes, he will have to work hard and study, but there are also many fun times at school too like making new friends, recess, music, coloring, learn new things, etc.|`|yNInHaMPaa	I dont think your parents ever showed you love or affection. Never showed you that your moods is how your life will become. If you looked foward to accomplishing something, maybe you wouldnt feel that way. You said in my question that my kids would be ashamed to have me as a mother (about a tattoo idea). maybe it is because you envy that i would want to do something that took thought about my children. Anways best of luck to you. You seem like you defintly did not feel affection when you were younger if you were scared to go to school and learn and see friends when you were in kindergarten-first grade.<br>  <br>  I think that is where you are wrong. I was not saying that high schoolers dont feel that way, but at age 5-6?? I am sorry but back then i was too excited to see my friends for the day, and to color in the "lines". And that is exactly how my stepdaughter is as well. I will not disagree high schoolers feel that way maybe even some middle schoolers, but 5-6?? I really think there may have been something lacking if you did not look foward to sitting on the circle during story time.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	Ha no I don't think it is extraordinary.|`|BRT2teSqaa	Its nothing extraordinary- get off your high horse!  A lot of kids don't enjoy school and hate going.  Completely normal.
c4e518a123e1b13a4b34572b4563c670aa	I read a few days ago that it is actually soothing. I rub my belly all the time, I just can't help it! I also sing, talk, and read to the baby. I've noticed that if the baby is kicking a lot and I start to talk to it, it calms down. It's amazing! I can't wait until the baby arrives! Congratulations and good luck!|`|GwwDxbfUaa	It can hear you... read to it!  Sing to it!  Let it know your opinion on politics, religion, drugs, smoking and talk to it about sex and anything else you might think you couldn't talk to it about later....    might as well get the practice in now.  You will eventually have to have those conversations and will be wondering what to say...|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Yes i read that 2 weeks ago lol Im 21 weeks now, congrats :D If i rub my belly if seems to stop the baby kicking maybe its in my head but you nevr know :) <br>  All the best|`|eryJKCpfaa	I read that it is soothing for them! im 29 weeks and rub mine all the time!|`|b17cb0e70d1cd57271e4ba763c7fbc30aa	The baby is still pretty small yet so it wouldn't feel you just rubbing your belly. But it probably would feel the poking & prodding that your doctor might do. <br>  I am 18 weeks and find out the sex next week too! So exciting!|`|YSCBdDfqaa	Yes, I've recently read that the baby is sensitive to touch at this stage.  He/she can hear you too.  Congrats :)
mPpJc2mhaa	Find interests and hobbies you guy's have together. Then, once you find a couple, hook up together.

Find common intrests, just general things to talk about. Then as you get more and more comfortable talking to him you can start dropping subtle, or not so subtle depending on your "style" so he knows that you like him.|`|UAJjnsBuaa	Omg that same thing happened to me! i found out he was WAY to hot so i had to pretend he was some other person and didn't really look at him to complete the effect!<br>  <br>  plus if you tell him you like him there's an 80% chance he'll say dido!
pXSKSS3daa	Too often!<br>  <br>  I've been buying a lot lately since his first birthday is coming up. It's been fun to buy him summer toys since he'll most likely be walking by then.<br>  <br>  As far as clothing I like Target(though not so much as of late. All the older infant clothing for boys is ugly IMO), Old Navy, and Carter's. Walmart sometimes has cute stuff, too.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	If I can find a good sale, I'll buy something for the next few sizes that she'll grow into. Otherwise, I wait and buy items as she needs them. As for toys, she doesn't' get new ones all the time..she has plenty! I buy most of her clothes at Old Navy, Marshalls, and Children's Place.|`|wKYdIaZVaa	Clothes: Just about every week. Either I buy something cute at a store or one of my sisters buy Chloe something. <br>  <br>  Toys: About every month. I'll pick something up new to entertain her. <br>  <br>  Movies: When a new Disney one is released from the vault.<br>  <br>  Food: Every week I stock up! :)<br>  <br>  My favorite place to buy Chloe clothes is at Marshalls (beautiful Ralph Lauren things at a great price! :) Target is a close second with their Dwell Studio collection.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I get my son something whenever I go to the store (other then grocery stores). I live in a small hick town and the only store that sells baby stuff is the WalMart so that is where I go. My sister works at Babies R Us in the clothing department and whenever she marks something down really low she picks it up for me! It is nice that she works there!|`|rFtKFp03aa	Every time I go out! I can't help it.. <br>  <br>  I buy their clothes and local baby boutiques they have the cutest clothes and usually aren't tons of other babies always wearing the same thing.. <br>  <br>  I like baby gap too a lot.. they usually have cute clothes.. same as gymboree and children's place..|`|KmwvwT6Eaa	i buy them all the time. the places depends on sales|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	i buy the new clothing every 3 months.. i get 7 tops and 7 bottoms (one per day) along with socks :).. the most important thing for me is that the clothing is made from cotton and that it stretches - there's nothing worse than a baby who's clad in jeans or courdroys and cannot climb a sofa.. also, if the fabric is stiff, then it will pull the diaper down - and that's something that no one wants to see happen.. the best clothing that i have found is actually at target - it's more or less true to size and is cheap, so there is no breaking the bank when it's time to get a whole new wardrobe.. however, when it comes to shoes, i do splurge on stride rite shoes (to soften the blow, i put some money aside each month on their gift card, so when the time comes to pay $40 for a pair of sneakers, i have the money ready).. i understand that it's over the top but i've learned that comfortable shoes means a happy baby.. but it's a personal opinion :) i know a lady whose kids wore shoes from walmart and the kids are fine.. so i suppose it's a personal preference.. the toys i get either from ebay or from freecycle network (don't tell my husband though.. lol.).. the thing is that my child is into barney however it's next to impossible to find new toys in the stores.. movies.. hhmm.. my baby doesnt' watch tv, so no movies necessary.. yes, this means that she's on my case 24/7 :).. however, i did get tons of books from freecycle network and now when my child is scribbling in a book that someone paid $6.99 for, i am not screaming at her to put the pen down but just remind myself how lucky i am to have my sanity :)|`|GBpLZ2REaa	I lucked out- one of my girlfriends had her son in April of last year. She had soo many clothes (5 huge plastic tubs and garbage bags full) that her son had outgrown. I'm pretty much all set on clothes until my son is 9 months old. When it does come time to buy baby clothes and things I'll probably buy most of his clothing at Target and maybe a few items at Babies R Us if he needs something special for pictures. Old Navy has some cute baby clothes too and they aren't expensive.|`|R0EsQapRaa	Unfortunately too often.... we have so much stuff and she is only 8 months old.<br>  <br>  I like getting clothes at Target and Kohl's Dept. store.  They are inexpensive and always have a great selection.  I don't see the point in spending alot of money on clothes they wear for a few months.  Besides who really cares if your kid is wearing something from The Children's Place or Gymboree for example.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	i buy my 4mth old son clothes, blankets and sheets and occasionally rattles/books every week. I like best and less, big w and target. <br>  <br>  we started out with the very basics, so now whenever i see something we can afford or that is a major bargin, i pick it up for now or future use.<br>  <br>  he tends to get one new thing a week :)|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	I buy her clothes every 3 months when she gets close to outgrowing them...or when I see something super cute. As for toys she's overloaded with them from the grandparents...but we did buy her 2 new small ones a few weeks ago. I LOVE buying her clothes though. I like Dillards, Macy's, Old Navy, Crazy 8s, and Baby Gap. Those are my faves.|`|JvM44Bx5aa	Often, especially for my first baby.  <br>  <br>  Here below you will find some cute and wonderful clothes for your baby at the following stores:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/bottom-price-baby-girl-clothes-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/bottom-price-ba...</a><br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/bottom-price-baby-boy-clothes-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/bottom-price-ba...</a>|`|ME62Mtv4aa	with my first I bought everything NEW, now after I see how quick they grow out of things i buy second hand clothes from childrens consignment shoppes they are all gently used and very cheap. Same with toys I get them from yard sales etc.|`|hXoUFWL1aa	I can't help but buy him stuff almost every weekend. It's just so fun and he's only 3 months so he always can use stuff. I pretty much buy his clothes anywhere..Target, Walmart, that kinda thing.|`|dHfFqVqhaa	i'm on a tight budget but i try to get my son a new toy once a month something for his age.Clothes are another story he grows out of them frequently so every two months i get a few new things to replace the ones he's outgrown.I like to shop at babies r us and target but i also like a bargain so if i see something worth buying at a thrift store or yard sale and i have the cash i'll pick it up.|`|CmnnfJEDaa	i only buy stuff every now and then that is reduced, and favourite place to buy clothes would probably be kmart. here where i live there isnt many places to choose clothes for males which makes it hard to dress up my son.|`|79kPBWMnaa	New as in store packaged new or new as in new to them? Clothes I get as they need them mostly on sale or at consignment. Toys if they are on a good sale or for birthdays, etc.|`|zYW48dzlaa	on each visit to the market.<br>  <br>  where i see nice and good stuff i buy that.|`|204a29808dd89f01bb5e69f3863d8c66aa	every time i get a chance
O3EtP4vOaa	Soy is very bad for fertility, so I would not know why you would take it to get pregnant.  Soy causes an increase of estrogen in the body, but that extra increase can prevent you from becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  I would not take it.
r39EDGhPaa	Don't listen to the person who said your boyfriend is a loser.  You guys discussed that beforehand for a reason.  If you were to get pregnant and you wanted to keep the baby and he wanted an abortion, that would be a different story- but you guys already talked it out (good for you, by the way, you're one of the few.)<br>  <br>  You can get pregnant, but I think you are alright.  You were probably the one who was wet, and precum isn't [likely] to get you pregnant, but it has happened.. so just be really careful next time :)  If you guys want to do something like that again, have him throw a condom on or be on birth control so you don't have anything to really worry about.|`|SsfnitjXaa	If you are not ready to get pregnant then either don't have sex or you get on birth control (and learn how to use it) AND he puts on a condom when fooling around.|`|i3pn4jNcaa	people annoy me when they say all these mean things about abortion & sex if your not ready for consequences. well i have news for them, sex isn't just about reproducing anymore its a way to express love with someone. & esp in teen years your going to experiment. <br>  <br>  <br>  anyways, i doubt your pregnant. just take a test if you are late with your period and dont stress because that makes your period late.|`|AA10186411	I have one thing to say.  DUMP THIS LOSER.  He obviously does NOT love you if he is already saying you have to have an abortion if you get pregnant.  What a piece of dirt!  Yes, its possible.  Not very likely, but definitely possible.  Again, ditch that loser, and get more respect for yourself.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Why would you even want to be with a guy like that?  "oh, if I knock you up, I'll just make you get rid of it."<br>  <br>  NO sense of responsibility.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	Haha well ... unless you have sex ... its 99.99999999999999999% impossible to get pregnant. Its onyl ever happened once ... her name. The Virgin Mary.|`|AA11296427	Don't risk it. Even when just goofing around, you should all ways wear a condom. Better to be safe than sorry, right?

Good luck :)|`|24e08edff6a7f457ff2fc915564d7ef8aa	If you feel like something is not right you should call you doctor. He/She may have you go to the hospital to be monitored just to be on the safe side. You don't want your baby to come out just yet and if you are in the early stages of labor it's best to have it stopped right away. Even if it turns out that you aren't in labor it's better to be safe than sorry!|`|AA12395149	There is typically a drop in appetite towards the end of pregnancy.  Your growing uterus is taking up more and more space in your abdomen, making for less room for your stomach and thus, less space for your meals.  Eat smaller, more frequent meals to try and avoid the sick feelings.  Your lower gastrointestinal tract is being effected by your fluctuating hormones, making you go more than normal some days, and constipated other.  As long as you don't have liquid diarrhea, you should be fine.  If you have liquid diarrhea, stay hydrated (stay hydrated whether or not you have diarrhea) and try to supplementing with gatorate or pedialyte so help replace possibly lost electrolytes.  If it persists, see your doctor.<br>  <br>  The pressure is being caused by the baby settling in.  You may even start to experience pain in your semphis pubis (the bones right over your birth canal), this is because they are stretching and semi separating, getting ready for birth.|`|LXrBpthGaa	sounds like you may possibly be in labor. Both my labors started as menstral crampy feelings kinda like the pelvic pressure, and feeling like going #2, you may be starting the very beguning of labor, i'd call the doc and just see what they say though.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	could be a sign of preterm labor. no its not normal.|`|eryJKCpfaa	im sure it is all normal. i would just call your dr office to be safe! goodluck

AA12395149	Personally, I'm thinking of going on the nuva ring after my pregnancy.  You just have to put it in once a month.  The thing about the ring is you have to be comfortable with putting in the ring and taking it out.  There is also the depo shot, you have to get that once every three months.  There are implants that slowly release the hormones and can be good for as many three years.  <br>  <br>  There are also intrauterine contraceptives that you can now use since you've had a baby, provided you haven't had an ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease and are in a monogamous relationship.  The doctor put it in in the office and discusses with you how to make sure it's still in place.<br>  <br>  All of these forms of control are good, but they all also require attention on your part.  If you miss a shot, forget to replace the ring, or don't routinely check your IUC, you could get pregnant.  If you're good at remembering to take the pill every day, you'll probably do well with any of these, just set reminders on your calender or PDA or cell phone.|`|RiRA86psaa	Depo-Provera is about 98 % effective and you only have to get it every 3 months it is a shot. You do not have your period while on it.|`|yw13cnDgaa	Not having sex? It's the most fool-proof method ever invented. :)|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	i would definately not recommend the shot...i would go with the pill|`|6014e877df433a9c4aa2133e5b670a4faa	How about have him cut it off! Well hell its only a suggestion! Damn you don't have to get violent! Damn I'm sorry I'm sorry I won't say it again quit hitting me!|`|MsipL0Mzaa	an iud?...the new mireana one?...|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	you should discuss this with your doctor. we don't know how your hormones are or your medical history, so we really can't recommend one method over another. everyone's body reacts differently to all methods, no two women are exactly the same when it comes to what types they like and are able to take per their individual situation.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I had Paragard the copper IUD in. It is great. It lasts for up to 10 years, you get your own period, no real negative side effects, don't have to take a pill every day, and you just need to check it once a month. I like it and highly recommend it.|`|NPmRmnG6aa	I was on the patch for a few years and it made my periods be just one heavy clot.  I had been off it for years and my periods are still full of clots. I talked to my doc and he said it was fine as long I was not having clots in between my periods, but I still stopped using it. Before we got pregnant we were just using condoms, and had good luck with the 3 years and no baby, and we will be going back to them after baby. My husbands insurance does not cover <br>  BC and we don't want to pay out of pocket for it when condoms are cheaper.<br>  <br>  I also gained a lot of weight on the patch, and it left a nasty mark on my hip. It is gone now but took about a year to wash off|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Depends on when you want to get pregnant again.<br>  If you want to wait a few years, then get an IUD, like Mirena.  Minimal side effects, with great coverage|`|AA11763588	I've known to many people get pregnant off of the shot and the patch. I'm going to go back on the pill after I give birth.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	What about the implant its very effective but can cause people to put on weight easily
AA10624857	It depends a lot on your doctor's preferences as well as your medical concerns, if any. Some doctors will induce around the due date and some will induce before if there is a medical reason to do so. Since you are 90% effaced an nearing 2 cm dilation you are actually in the early stages of labor already. A membrane strip on Tuesday may or may not help labor along. It is not uncommon for the water to break before contractions start, but it doesn't mean that labor will progress so quickly you can't make it to the hospital. 30 minutes isn't too far from the hospital so you'll have plenty of time to get to the hospital if your water breaks at home. It is only an estimation that your baby weighs 8 pounds. Whatever method your doctor used to determine the weight is only based on averages. I was told my 4th baby would easily top 8 pounds, but she was born at 41 weeks weighing 6 pounds 14 ounces. Sometimes estimations are right on, but not always. I think if your baby is doing well and you remain healthy that there is a good chance your doctor will prefer to let nature run the show. Even with a membrane sweep, there is no guarantee that will ge things started. All 4 of my babies were born past their due dates by 9 days, 11 days, 5 days, and 7 days. I had several membrane sweeps, but none of them did anything for me. You can certainly discuss your concerns with your doctor on Tuesday since he/she knows your health history the best, but I think if everything is going well that letting your body and your baby choose the right time to go into labor is the best way to go.|`|Vm0k6MfJaa	Honestly every doctor is different. If you had my doc. he would do it. My husband is military and he was home and so I was full term and the doctor stripped my membranes and we induced labor before I hit past due so my husband could be there. Stripping my membranes didn't actually work for me. Talk to your doctor about yoru concerns and express that you would like to try having your membranes stripped. If seh thinks all is well and your baby is fine (which it sound slike you have a healthy baby in there) then she'll probably go along with it. I wasn't even dialated when my doctor started trying to encourage my body. Good luck!

CVdcrY3kaa	This is sad, if it's true. If you can't provide a loving, stable, happy home for your son & you're not willing to make major changes, and sacrifices for him -- then yes, signing over your rights and allowing a loving family to adopt him is the right thing (in my opinion) Your sister still sounds young though, but if she's willing and able to take care and raise this child it's better than something bad happening to him.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Personally I think if you make your bed you need to lie in it. Being a mother is all about growing up and taking responsibility for your own.  You were mature enough to have sex then you darn well need to be mature enough to handle your child. You have family support. They have and will continue to help you i'm sure until you are old enough to get a job and take care of your child on your own. Babies cry. That won't change between now and if you have another.|`|rFtKFp03aa	I think it would be hard to give it to your sister..

I don't want you to make a decision that you may wind up regretting.<br>  <br>  The first few months of a baby's life are always the hardest on new parents.  It will get better.  In the meanwhile, can your family babysit here and there, so you can get some sleep, do your homework, or just go hang out at the mall for an hour or so?  <br>  <br>  You're right, your life will never be the same again.  A baby changes everything.  My daughter is 8 months old, and I haven't had ONE HOUR to myself since she was born!!  I take care of her first, and me second.  <br>  <br>  You're a good example to all these other young girls on yahoo answers, who thinks it's so cool to have a baby when they are teenagers.  They need read your question, seriously!!<br>  <br>  Good luck!  It WILL get better.|`|OBPL49vWaa	your obviously not mature enough to have a child. your more worried about what your friends are doing than what your baby needs. Obviously you should of that about that before you went and had sex, but you were mature enough to do that.  i think that you should give the baby to your sister, i think maybe when you grow up a little bit you will regret it and it will cause a lot of family drama.  You should be able to talk to you teachers and they should be able to help you out.|`|AA11435162	I think it would be the best thing for you and the baby, if you let your sister adopt them baby.  You can always have babies later on in life.  Have fun and enjoy yourself at your age.|`|Ks7lENScaa	Wow.  This is hard.  This is a decision you have to make in the end.  I mean your sister is only 18 she is a kid herself.  I say see if your mom can be of more help.|`|jH8hIB0kaa	I'm so sorry. You need more help than we can give you here.

I was 19 when my first was born and that all happened to me also but I stuck it out like a mom should and loved every bit of it. I now have a second baby that is 3 months old and my oldest is 4 years. But if you truly can't do it then for the babies sake please sign her over, you can always see her and hold her if your sister has her right? Just don't do it again and have another baby to pass on to someone else. You need to realize that 13 year olds aren't supposed to be having babies, what are you in middle school? OMG girl I could of never handled a baby in middle school.|`|QTSsGbubaa	if this is tru then yes it is a good idea. let ur sister take over the baby an let the baby live a good life. rather then u struggle and not to mention not be able to provide for him. u need to finish schoool an get a good job then think of having a baby...  n the other RUDE person who called u a "troll"? is actually right. u should take the 6 weeks u are allowed... consult ur doc about a note to pull u out. ur guidence office will allow u to get ur work from the teacherrs n finish it on ur own time at home|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	you have to look out for a baby.. even though you are a mother, you are unable to provide the atmosphere for a baby to grow in.. you missing parties is nothing compared to the uncertainty that your baby is facing - where would he go if you can't find a job? how will you find a job without higher education when your grades are going down the drain?.. soon enough he will grow up and start asking you questions.. the only option based on your story is to give your son up for adoption - luckily you have a sister, but will she agree? and another point is for you not to mention to him that you are his mother. why? because you are unable to care for him - and that's a mother's job.. you will be seeing him but if he asks you that if you love him, why would you give him up - it's going to be tough to answer plus his life will be messed up if he learns that his mother abandoned him.. so you have to keep it simple - you brought him into this world but the person who raises the child actually becomes the child's parent - so plan accordingly|`|SsfnitjXaa	Are you doing it so you can go out and party , hang with your friends and be free?

Speak with your doctor about keeping track of your heart rate and staying safe.|`|fG727pkuaa	Yes, its healthy for the baby. Just don't do intense workout. I knew someone who was in the police academy and trained the entire time and didnt realize she was pregnant! Her baby came out fine.
5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	He's overstimulated from everything that's happened during the day. You can't prevent it. Just cuddle him until it passes. Our daughter cries like that a couple of nights a week sometimes for up to an hour. Do your crying checklist and when nothing solves the problem, just cuddle.<br>  <br>  If you can't stand the crying (which can happen!) pop him in a sling, take a walk and listen to your iPod.|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	It's fussy time!  When my daughter was 3 months old, her fussy time was 5pm-8pm, every freakin' day!!!  It went away after a month, but boy was it frustrating!<br>  <br>  What worked for me was to give her a late afternoon nap, which seemed to make her not so cranky.  Also, I rocked her in my arms with the same rhythmic motion.  She seemed to respond well to that too.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	From 2-3 months old my daughter always cried from 8pm to around 11pm. My partner and I tried everything. I felt so bad! I thought I was doing something wrong. For some reason she became very unsettled at night. She grew out of it thank goodness. Id say its just a faze. All the best.|`|UAJjnsBuaa	maybe he hates to fall asleep... i know i did|`|R0EsQapRaa	My daughter went through something similar... now I can't remember what age she was, but it happened every night anywhere from 8:00pm-9:00pm.  She was inconsolable.  I called the pediatrician and she called it the "bewitching" hours.  It is very common and lasts several weeks and then just dissapears.  I thought my daughter experienced it at more like 3 months, but I could be wrong.  <br>  <br>  There was really nothing that worked for us either.  I'm sure you've tried everything from rocking him in a dark room to singing.  If you haven't already see what the pediatrician recommends.<br>  <br>  It sounds like the same situation we had. It will pass.... hang in there!|`|RPoFBenJaa	Its his "fussy time". My four month old does the same thing at 7pm every night like clock work. All you can do is comfort him, maybe try to give him a bath, rock in a rockin chair. He might be teething as well and his gums hurt so when he gets fussy it just makes his gums hurt more. Tylenol will help that or baby oragel. If crying it out is the only thing that sooths him (coincidentally) let him do that and just try to stay calm. When you get upset or raise your voice it makes him scared and more upset. Keep your cool. If you have to let him cry in his crib if he doesn't want to be held. He'll get over this, its normal. Good luck, hope I helped.|`|79kPBWMnaa	Is there something that happens at 8 every night in your home?  Maybe he doesn't like it or it scares him. It could be anything. Or maybe you should put him to bed at 8, he could be very tired and fighting it.|`|VpcT7dUgaa	Good for you for being concerned and not content to let your precious son "cry it out". It's not healthy (stress hormones flood his body, his blood pressure and heart rate are up) for him to cry for an extended amount of time so it's wonderful that you're searching for answers.<br>  Don't rule out food sensitivities. If he's on formula get him on a pro-biotic right away. If he's on breast-milk (I hope) have your wife eliminate dairy. <br>  <br>  My five-month-old son does the same thing. He just needs help falling asleep. The ONLY thing that works is if I put him in our Baby K'tan in the "Hug" position and take a fast walk (even if the walk is just back and forth the length of our condo). The motion has him to sleep in under 10 minutes. That K'tan is the best money I ever spent. It's about the 6th carrier that I've purchased but it's the only one that's ever been comfortable for my baby AND for me. Check out the Instructions to see all the different positions.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't give up! Try car rides, try a swing, check out the DVD of "The Happiest Baby on the Block" at your library.
S0P7ZnFNaa	Well, for starters your an IDIOT for not using protection!! <br>  <br>  The likely hood of getting pregnant is HUGE, and isnt a joke, or something to be looked past. <br>  Im a young mom, and having a child a big repsonsibility, and I certainly wasnt ready for it.. and your 17... fresh outta of High School, no future.. no career yet. <br>  I would definitely suggest going to see your OBGYN or go to planned parent hood to find out.<br>  Its a lil to early to detect actual signs... But everyone is different.. Its not a guessing game.. go get tested!!!|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	It's unlikely that you are pregnant just a few days after ending your period, but anything is possible most women don't have a twenty-eight day cycle and sure-fire ovulation on day fourteen. That said, the withdrawal method is not a very good form of birth control, unless you and your boyfriend are both one hundred percent okay with and can handle having a baby right now it would be very smart to use condoms at least. Even if you were going to get pregnant from those recent acts of intercourse, you would not be experiencing any symptoms right now as the fertilized egg would probably not have even implanted by now (implantation takes place about five days later). And it's implantation which begins the production of hormones that would cause tiredness, nausea and chills.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	I think that you need to go get a pregnancy test because nobody here is psychic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	You say you have no doubt your not but there always that thought , That means that you don't have no doubt  That you have some doubt . <br>  I don't see why you would let your boyfriend go inside you but you should really use condoms . There is always a chance you can get pregnant , Evan With a condom and birthcontrol , That why using nothing is very risky.|`|OBPL49vWaa	well if you dont use a condom then you always have a chance and esp if he is going inside you now. you could be but i doubt you would already be showing symptoms.|`|6L9jJnchaa	It's EXTREMELY likely that you are pregnant.  You're asking for it.|`|WHi0WWiIaa	sounds to me like your trying to get pregnant. and the likely hood of it is pretty good. me and my boyfriend have been usuing the pull out method for 5 years and we are now expecting in sept.
pdLdYCyvaa	no it will be fine. You are just an employee, it should be fine
k3pdNfTAaa	I'm going through the exact same thing but I get my period at the end of this week (I hope). I dont know if I am either.<br>  <br>  I've had headaches, been super tired, been eating way too much and spotted a few days after sex. I hope I'm not but if I am, so be it. I'll have to face the music haha.|`|WHi0WWiIaa	i usually get my period at the begining of the month too. found out yesterday baby's on the way!!!|`|6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	You have to wait at least 10 days before you take the test from your missed period or else you will get a false negative.  I recommend waiting a week or so and taking one. Then wait another week if you still don't have your period and take another. If you are very stressed about it, it could prolong the time until your next period. Plus depending on your age you might just have missed a period randomly (it happens all the time, even to girls who have a "regular" cycle.) If you still don't get your period in a few weeks go see your doctor and they can do a pregnancy test as well by drawing blood. Good Luck|`|1EvcWbpgaa	yes it is possible. take a pregnancy test. if it says negative wait a week or so (maybe even a few days) if your period hasn't started, take another test. if u get another negative without a period, call your doctor
HoonZJMgaa	Hi I am married and have  new baby I find I get back more now that we are married than we did single. Perhaps you make a substantially different amount of money than your friends or they have other deductions that you may not qualify for. However, the calculator can be wrong. I had tax preparers make mistakes on my taxes and later received letters from the irs stating I had more money coming so check your answers to whatever questions they ask again and GOOD LUCK|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	depends on exemptions|`|GBpLZ2REaa	They may have paid in more taxes throughout the year. How many exemptions did you claim on your payroll taxes? If they paid more in all year (and got more taken out of each check), that could be a reason why they would also get more back at the of the year. Also, did either of them go to school? If they did, they probably got tax credits such as the Lifetime Learning Credit and Hope credit. Maybe they got a deduction for buying a house or a hybrid vehicle. Maybe they qualified for the earned income credit. There are many reasons why they could have gotten more back.<br>  <br>  Check your pay stubs and see how many exemptions you claim throughout the year. If you claim 3, they will take less taxes out of your paycheck each week, but you'll also get less back at the end of the year. Personally, I'd rather have more taken out of each check and get a big refund at tax time. My husband and I always claimed 0 exemptions so we'd get a bigger tax refund..
21e2df8fa47efbcd44eaee35a303bd20aa	Its just the lining that develops on your uterine wall... this is what later becomes the placenta and aids in nutrition for your baby. <br>  As long as the tissue isnt larger than about ping pong ball size than you should be fine...however if the clots are large then you should see your doctor to rule out any problems such as endometriosis. <br>  <br>  you and your hubby should speak with your primary care physician for any pointers to help get pregnant and to get started on good prenatal vitamins.|`|xI0M1lBoaa	the lining of the uterus sheds during your period - that's the tissue. I don't think it has anything to do with fertility.
3zuT1bDWaa	Hun that's normal i had that same problem your plug will be like a jelly bean and about a size of a nickle or maybe a quarter. If your really concerned about it then go see your doctor to make sure it isn't a  yeast infection.|`|Mi0f4Hufaa	i am 34 weeks pregnant and i had been have braxtons a lot and for hours at a time. she told me more than 4 in 1 hour is the point to come in. so if i were you i would go in and just make sure everything is ok and so you have some peace of mind.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Your plug or just discharge. If it is your plug you could go in a couple days or a couple weeks. 35 weeks is a little early though so call your doc.|`|AA12395149	You are experiencing Braxton Hicks contractions.  Your uterus is pretty much practicing and getting ready for the big day.  As long as they are not regular, you will be fine, just stay hydrated and get rest when you need it.  <br>  <br>  Vaginal discharge changes frequently throughout pregnancy.  As long as it isn't green or foul smelling, you will be fine.  If you have a gush of fluids or start having blood that is like the second day of your period, you need to be evaluated for possibly being in labor.<br>  <br>  best of luck.
AA11763588	Most women ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day they start their period and sperm can hang out waiting on an egg for 72 hours.<br>  <br>  Anytime you have unprotected sex you are at risk to become pregnant.|`|Dg0D8SCZaa	YES. no matter when you have unprotected sex, there is ALWAYS the risk of getting pregnant, just days 10-14 are when most women are the most fertile.|`|01vMpHkWaa	yep<br>  i got pregnant on the last day or the day after it ended<br>  not sure because i wasnt bleeding that day but when my bf stuck his stuff in and pulled back on there was blood<br>  <br>  <br>  TMI..but idc.|`|yjhpBM11aa	YES! you can even get pregnant if you have sex the very last day of your period. Remember sperm can live inside you for 5 days and that just enough time for them to hang around in there until you ovulate.|`|7xit1ogxaa	Yes, it is not as likely, but not every woman ovulates on the date that doctors consider "normal".|`|1ikl5q97aa	unlikely because your egg has not been relased yet but is possible .|`|Y2VsqIO7aa	It depends on how long each period is and if you have a regular cycle. The most important part of your period is your First day. Approximately, the 14th day  after the First day of your period is the time of your ovulation ( you could get pregnant here). But remember that sperm can survive inside the girl's body for 3 days. So, you shouldn't have sex 3 days before and 3 days after your ovulation (to be safe). Therefore, don't have sex on the 11th to 17th day after the First day of your period. If you find it hard to remember that, here's a simple tip: just observe your regular vaginal discharges. If they're elastic, slippery and plenty then, you're not safe to have sex. To prevent future worries about being pregnant, use condom. Aside from removing the "worries", it would lessen your chance of getting STDs (sexually transmitted diseases).|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Yes..... You can get pregnant anytime you have sex ANY TIME , It's just some times are much more effective.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: Becs doesn't no what they are talking about .|`|vdHVJISSaa	yes
BqqDJXkjaa	I would take him to the dr just incase it is a uti (coz imagine how frustrating & painful it would be if it is! Poor thing!) and then you can go back to working on a new method - like maybe having to count to 3 while he's peeing or something???|`|PrxlHUT5aa	I don't think he is sick... he just enjoys going to the potty... you have it easy then :o) no need to bribe him or potty train him for long.  even if he force out urine it wouldn't really hurt him -- a few trickle won't hurt and his frequent visit to the loo shouldn't infuriate you.  while other kids hold their pee till they turn blue in the face, consider yourself lucky lol
471ca0c8552c4633e525815ba702310aaa	Sometimes being a good parent is a hassle, but when it comes to safety I'd take hassle over injury any day.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i wouldn't simply bc i wouldn't be able to live with myself if something happened that  i could have prevented; slight discomfort now, safety....i go for the discomfort...|`|pXSKSS3daa	Hon, I'm not here to lecture you but I will give you my opinion on it. Please don't take it as me insulting you, I'm sure you're a wonderful mother and just want what's best(and most comfortable) for your son.<br>  <br>  I've done tons of research on this because I'm considering leaving Noah rear facing until past the age of one. He's 10 and a half months now and is about 22 lbs. and 29 inches so not as big as your boy, but he's not tiny either. I figure I'd much rather deal with a broken leg(or two) than a broken neck.<br>  <br>  Again, please don't think I'm lecturing you. Best of luck on your decision.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I've actually seen the labels reading 20 lbs OR 1 year of age. But, I'd say if he sits well and sounds like he's WAY big enough, I'd get him a 5 point harness carseat so he can sit up and face forward! No one needs to know how old he is! He's a big enough boy, that I honestly think he'd be fine. I'm practically thinking of getting my 8 month old son a harness carseat! LOL! Ok... Not really, cause he's still only 18  lbs, but if he were as big as your baby, I'm pretty sure I'd do that. At least he'll be comfortable. Maybe just put one in the car and try him in it for a couple days. If he does fine, then let him stay in it! :) Good luck!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	My SIL did it with her daughter, and she was, and is fine.  So far, they have yet to be in an accident.  If it was me, I wouldn't!  You know it's safer for then to be rear facing, not only till they're 1 and 20lbs, but even longer.  You may not be able to do that, but you should keep him facing backwards until he can no longer possibly be that way.  It's putting your child's life at risk, if something happened, you would only blame your self!|`|u94HOVz7aa	this is the problem my sis in law just faced her son was bigger than the average 1 yr old.  so she called the state patrol and told them all about her son and asked if she could switch him around (he was 10 months at the time)  they told her that because of his size he could be switched around.  they then called his pediatrician and asked they said the same thing.  that it was better to keep rear facing, but ok foward facing seeing as he was so big.  So they switched him.  now they risk the possibility of a ticket, but they would only have to take is size info proving his size and they could get the ticket dropped is what the state patrol told them. we are in washington state btw.  (if that matters)<br>  <br>  my children were skinny minnies so it wasnt an issue so much.  my only problem was the height.  the state patrol told me to teach them to sit criss cross apple sauce for comfort.  one did, one wouldnt.  mine were 18months before they were even close to 20 lbs. (like i said skinny minnies)|`|8WOzftFuaa	we put our son forward facing at about 10 months cause we had the same problem you are having.<br>  but if you ever get pulled over by the cops i believe they could charge you... but not sure<br>  <br>  edit... ya if he looks bigger then i doubt they would question you about it.  I know they say it isnt safe but really  is it worth to listen to your kid complain b/c hes uncomortable!|`|cX3VJNaPaa	Not sure if you will consider this opinion or fact, but here is my take on it:  Your sons neck and back are not strong enough to withstand the force of a crash.  He needs to stay rear facing. Would you rather a broken leg or a broken neck?  I would keep him rear facing.|`|QKGuNLb4aa	ok im not a mom (wish i was) but i do know for a fact (lol) that you need to go more so by your babies size rather than age.  my neices car seat actually said that in the manual it was a britax but cant remember which one.|`|1SGl03Zlaa	My daughter was a big baby too and I had the same problem with her legs scrunching up.  I asked the public health nurse about it because I thought it would be safer to have her forward facing but she told me it was ok if her feet were scrunched up.  I did end up turning her around a month early because we were going on a two hour drive and I didn't want her all scrunched up for that long.  I would consider how well your son can support himself not just his weight.  Does he sit up real well unsupported without falling over or is he still a little floppy?  A big part of why they say rear facing until a year is because they don't have as much control and support of their bodies until then.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	How bad do I really think it is?  I think that even 12 month olds are way too small to be safe forward facing in a crash.  It's not about size or comfort, but about safety.  I know how obnoxious it is to wrestle and fight with babies to put them in the car, but it is best that they stay rear facing.  <br>  <br>  The problem is *not* with their size or their muscle strength.  Muscles will stretch and give, but bones and the spinal column won't.  Forward facing babies, in a crash, are pulled towards the front of the car, away from their seats.  The harness restrains their torso, but their head is pulled forward.  Yes, their neck muscles will give a bit, but their bones don't, and their spinal columns can snap.  Even adults get whip lash, so for babies it has to be awful to put them in that situation.<br>  <br>  I also think that just doing it because it's the law is a pretty awful reason.  I mean, regardless of what the law says, I'm responsible for my son's safety.  No, you probably won't get in trouble legally for doing it, but is that really the standard you're wanting to follow?<br>  <br>  I wish (you asked for opinions, not facts) that the law required children to remain rear facing for much longer, and for the maximum limits of the seat.  It's so much safer, and, honestly, I don't think I could live with myself if I were to be in an accident and my baby was severely injured or killed because I turned him around.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I waited untill one year to switch both my kids, they were also very big for there age.  He is your child and it is your decision.  The reason you should wait(not trying to beat a dead horse but...) is because there neck mussels are not strong enough untill one year and if by chance you were in an accident...cant even type it.  I would wait.  Can you borrow or buy another car seat that might be more comfortable.  My niece has a Britax and it is much smaller than the ones i had for my kids.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	My oldest son was also a big baby and still is a big boy. I turned his car seat around when he was about 8 months old. His feet were touching the back of the seat and I had to bend his knees just to get him in it! He also stopped riding in a booster seat at 4 because his butt would no longer fit on the seat. He was about 55 pounds by then. I don't see anything wrong with it. Thinking back now I believe I turned all my kids around before the age of one except my 15 month old. He is a little guy and always had someone sitting next to him to keep him entertained.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Dont do it. Im not trying to lecture. but one of my friends put her child in a front facing car seat at 9 months and she got into a wreck and her baby was in the hospital for 2 months. had he been in a rear facing he would have been fine. She was charged with child endangerment and she doesn't have her son anymore. Its illegal to put your child in a front facing before 1. I really wouldn't take the risk, yes he may weigh alot but its not they weight you have to worry about..its the way his neck is.|`|70kh6VSoaa	i put my daughter in one a little before she was the right size but not much her legs were all mashed up it just looked like it might hurt but when i did she loved it cause she could see out and she wasn't all squished|`|1795e9adbd644bbbce946795cd052957aa	It comes down to this.... it wouldn't be bad if you are never in an accident, but if you are, it could be the difference between life and death or safety and injury.  If you turn him early, you have to accept that you know the facts and are prepared to deal with the gamble.  Are you aware of WHY it's recommended to rear face them so long?<br>  <br>  For what it's worth, my son had the same issue and we turned him early.  We had a 2 door car and it became impossible to scrunch him in his seat.  By the time we had our daugther, I was of a different mind and wouldn't have turned him if I had it to do over again.  <br>  <br>  I would consider buying a different seat FIRST; and a different car NEXT.  You might consider moving the seat to a different position in the car or practicing getting him in differently than what you are now.    I know now that the side lip on our seat was what was causing us difficulty getting him in, combined with the 2 door and his size.  If we changed any ONE of those factors, it would have made all the difference.  Obviously, using a different seat would have been the least expensive.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	I put my Daughter Foward-Facing when she was your sons age, 9 months. She was about 22lbs and she was about 28 inches tall...<br>  <br>  I did it for the exact reason you are wanting to do it. I found it an absolute hassle to go ANYWHERE, she hated being rear-facing, she couldnt see nothing, nor me and she didnt like it, Plus, I was always having to hand her toys and it was hard to do...or, if she dropped her bottle it was hard to do...So, I switched her early because I felt like she was big enough and it was time. Since he is well big enough, and your trips are becoming just a complete nightmare, then its time!

E2UXN7J1aa	My doctor didn't do ultrasounds to find out the sex until 20 weeks. Some doctor will do them earlier. You can get one of the 3d/4d ones and find out quite early...I think it's 14 weeks or something like that, but it is usually recommended to wait until later on in pregnancy. Just be patient. I was dying to know as well. :)|`|KyhnSRrJaa	My doctor told me any time after 15 weeks, but it is better to wait until 18-22 weeks to be more accurate.  The wait is killing me, too!!!!!!  I can't wait to find out, but we just have to be patient.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	From about 16weeks i think. But your 20week ultrasound is more accurate as bub should have developed enough|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Usually around 18-22 weeks..but if you are lucky you can find out as early as 16 weeks, it just won't be as accurate.|`|xKT73EqMaa	Most doctors will do an ultrasound between 18-22 weeks to check on the baby. They can tell the gender at this point. Sometimes ultrasound technicians will make guesses, if you have an ultrasound earlier in pregnancy, but there is a decent risk for error if you do it too early. Male and female genitalia looks very similar early on. I had my ultrasound and found out I was having a girl at 20 weeks.|`|4YCsXqMDaa	15 weeks but its better to wait until at least 18-20. At 15 weeks i was told i was having a boy and at 20 weeks suprise its a girl lol so the longer the better!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Usually between 18-20 weeks when they do the anatomy scan (ultrasound).|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	16 weeks but you get a better result if you see it at 18 weeks
Iptnp2zCaa	If he's sleeping and gaining weight and thriving and you are getting sleep, then go for it.  <br>  <br>  His little body obviously isn't used to, nor wants, solids, stick with what works.  He's obviously gassy and something is bothering him if he's only pooping every 10 - 15 days???? am I reading this right?  Can't be... please explain more...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	How close to bedtime are you giving him solids?  I did notice that if I spaced solid meals so that they were at least an hour before a nap or bedtime, my son slept longer.  It makes sense - I don't like to go to bed immediately after a meal either.<br>  <br>  But you could also be drawing a cause and effect where there is none.  He might just be sleeping better now and the lack of solids has nothing to do with it.  You're probably going to have to risk a rough night and try it to know for sure.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My mother keeps pushing me to give my 7 month old solids but I don't want to because ofsimilar issues.  I gave him some peas and rice last night because my mothe INSISTED and nagged until I did.  He was up all night with gas and has been fussy all day today.  We first tried cereal at 4 months and juice, bad idea.  Then cereal and veggies at 6 months for about 2 weeks and then I stopped again.  He's 7 months now and I'll probably continue to wait until at least next month.  He doesn't need them and if they are cauding him pain why continue?|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Do what works for your baby, not everyone else's!  My daughter was breastfed only and she didn't eat solids until 10 months old.  She just flat out refused to eat them before she was ready.

5N3odm3Qaa	No! And do not listen to the propagandists. An abortion will NOT influence your ability to get pregnant in the future. If it was performed grossly incorrectly then you might have problems but the vast (vast, vast, vast) majority of abortions are done so methodically that any worry about future conception should not enter your mind.<br>  <br>  It's about on par with placing an IUD contraceptive device. In fact, the studies indicate a higher rate of improper placement of IUDs than botched abortions.<br>  <br>  You are also NOT at a higher risk of breast cancer (pro-life zealots, please reference the New England Journal of Medicine AND the American Cancer Society for enlightenment), drug abuse, or suicide. I just thought that was worth mentioning.<br>  <br>  If you do a Google search for this sort of thing, you'll find no shortage of highly scientific publications from the most respected institutions, all of which dispel the pro-life BS. I could offer at least ten websites from the nation's top institutions and organizations. The pro-lifers have... church.|`|m3cf7vsAaa	yes, it can effect your ability to get pregnant and or carry a child to full term.  Depending on how they performed the abortions and whether or not you have internal scarring.  I have also heard of the cervix weakening, resulting in miscarriages.  Scar tissue can prevent your ability to get pregnant altogether.  However if you took some form of oral pill to induce abortion, you are less likely to have after effects that would prevent you from getting pregnant again.  Also you should know that there are surgical procedures that may be able to fix your insides in order to allow you to have a child successfully.|`|6DLshTLnaa	definally. especially since you have had 2. not only can it prevent it, if you do get pregnant you have a higher chance of haveing a misscarriage, or have a handicapped baby|`|OBPL49vWaa	i know someone who has had 3 abortions and she now has 2 children and someone else whose had one and has to children.so i dont think so|`|BzCYQlcuaa	well yes and no. just like anything if life if could prevent pregnancy. but i also had a abortion when i was 14(due to a rape). i now am married and it took me a year and half to get pregnant. since it took so long for me to get pregnant... i started to worry that it was due to my abortion from years before. but i am now pregnant. and i know many people who are now pregnant and had abortions in the passed. i think if the abortion was done incorrectly or something went wrong yes this could prevent pregnancy. but don't stress and when your ready to have your family im sure you will be fine.|`|HOdblqIkaa	it can because of possible damage to your uterus but having one doesnt effect your eggs so you still can get pregnant but once you are you could have problems. if you do get pregnant tell your dr about your history and they will check you for possible damage and monitor you closely|`|l46COY9eaa	IF your abortions were performed in a normal, modern clinic, and they were as you said years ago, then you should be able to conceive and carry a healthy baby. Be up front with the doctors, they may choose to do a little more monitoring of you to make sure you carry well, and also the fact that you did conceive at one point is a good sign that you are fertile. Depending on how old you are now (say, in your thirties) conceiving may be more difficult just because of age, not past abortion.   Good luck hun!<br>  <br>  PS people she was asking a question, not asking for your judgement, shame on some of you!|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Like your other answers, the only way it would cause problems was if you had massive scarring from an abortion that caused problems with your cervix. This happens very rarely. <br>  <br>  I'm sure that with any pregnancy if there are problems or, God forbid birth defects, the mother will look at every single thing they did and blame themselves. It's just the way it goes.<br>  <br>  You will be fine!<br>  <br>  I had to answer because I hate that pro-life people can post any question, rant, or spew their misinformed and useless information whenever they want on here and no one says anything, but let someone post a pro-choice question and they are all over your butt. Some people are so ignorant it amazes me!|`|i9M0U9Meaa	yes ma'am it definitely can. it can cause soooo many problems. if you need more info try abortionfacts.com its a great site.|`|Mxe36NZEaa	Please ignore the prolife and prochoice propaganda that is bound to be spammed on this topic and consult a doctor.
5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	We have one. It gives you peace of mind especially when you're not in the same room. I'm forever checking to make sure Isabella's still breathing - even though I swore I wouldn't before she was born! <br>  <br>  Apparently the Angelcare monitors are the best - we got the Tommee Tippee one (it was more expensive and therefore better according to DF lol) which has a night light and temperature gauge. It's wonderful. You only need one power point for three different appliances, if you know what I mean. :-) Highly recommend it.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just wanted to add after reading a few things. Our monitor doesn't chirp or anything. The alarm has gone off for no reason once (in three months so that's pretty good I think). It doesn't make you paranoid.|`|578d3fb2ddadd63f9be866329b168f56aa	i have one as does my sister. we both highly recommend them.<br>  <br>  i have really bad hearing, my room is on the upstairs level, and my husband works midnights. i take every reassurance i can get, i mean how else do you listen for a baby to stop breathing. <br>  checking every 3 hours would make no difference...the damage would be done already.<br>  i do not get false alarms with mine, nor does my sister. there is a dial on the back for sensitivity, for those people who do get a false alarm. they have a few different styles, i like the one with the oversized sensor pad. <br>  <br>  also the alarm when sounded is loud, they say that when it goes off, it can wake and or jar/startle the baby, in effect waking the baby, who may otherwise not have awoken. perhaps all the 'false alarms' were not really false, but rather the baby woke up by it.<br>  truth be told, i'd take a false alarm anyday.<br>  <br>  my opinion, they are well worth the money and piece of mind. $90 is nothing compared to the things you are going to spend over the years, esp on crap that isn't really worth it.<br>  going to dinner and a movie these days costs $60, and that's for 3 hours of entertainment...<br>  you can always try it and keep the receipt. if you do keep it, the resell on them is great. <br>  i even use it still now that they are older if the get bad colds, i mean you just never know. plus once they get bigger you'll know when the get  out of bed etc.<br>  <br>  keep looking online, my walmart has them, and i know you can get them online depending on the one for $65-189 (digital, room temp, multiple receivers etc).|`|gFiRi5xnaa	As a new mom, I'm sure with or without the monitor you'll be checking on your baby constantly. They are cool if you have something to do around the house or some type of work that you know should be keeping you busy while the baby sleeps, but I hear from people that do have them, it gets annoying after a short while since it clicks with every single move and they don't use it anymore.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	My cousin had one of those.  The thing chirped ALL the time for no real reason and she would panic every single time.  If the batteries were low, it would chirp.  If it wasn't positioned just right under the baby, it would chirp.  If the baby yawned or sighed, it chirped.  It chirped for all sorts of reasons and did nothing but stress her out more than if she didn't have it.  She would lay in bed just waiting for it to chirp.  I have three children and have never used it.  My kids were all just as safe and I felt just as secure without using that thing.  Personally, its not something I would suggest.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Ok I am a mother to a 16 month old baby girl. Personally no, I wouldn't recommend it, yes I understand SIDS, but NO ONE knows what causes SIDS, and a simple 4.00 pack of binkys could help ease your mind. More than likely the baby will be in your room, she was beside my bed, like a little night table. Right by my head. You'll never have a sound night of sleep after that, I would wake up when she snorted a little bit. More than likely you won't need it, a friend of mine has one and it would go off all the time, for no real reason. Now her daughter is 2 years old and she regretted buying it every single night.|`|HnDwsN9raa	I personally would. I lost my daughter a little over a year ago and didnt know she was dead because she passed in her sleep. I really wish I would have gotten one of these back then. I am currently pregnant again and totally would get one but am getting a sleep apnea monitor instead from the hospital. It would really help put your mind at ease. Just my opionion though.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	if you want to be a super paranoid mother then totally go get one!  but otherwise know that 99.99999999% of women don't have them and all our babies turned out just fine.  It's a personal choice but I truly think it is unnecessary and they are just praying on your insecurities and charging you $90 to boot!|`|RqZOTRuraa	No, you shouldn't. You will be paranoid constantly.|`|eqJiIQGeaa	I do not think they are worth it. I have a month old baby and we aren't getting one... I really would rather spend that money on diapers cause believe me, he goes through diapers like nothing...|`|280a9307d4eae8421c7a937d62b06e83aa	Yep definitely worth the money - can you put a price on your childs life - absolutely not! Check out ebay if you want to get a bargain.|`|Mpi0mcWUaa	not really.|`|Y3cm5313aa	i bet it is. :)|`|M6c0hUefaa	It really depends. They have a high false alarm rate, BUT can help if you feel like you'll be extremely nervous. Really though, I thought I wouldn't be able to live without one, but I never bought it and just checked on my daughter very often and she's a healthy 10 month old. If you feel you'll feel better, get it. If you feel  you *could* live without it, just wait on buying it. I can understand why people want them though.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I have one, and love it.  It's especially good if your a worrier!  Gives me a piece of mind while I sleep.  Yeah chance are, your baby will be fine, and never stop breathing, but you know that if he did, you would know!  Also in the 4 months I have been using my Angelcare, I have had no false alarms!|`|u94HOVz7aa	my sister would have loved one of these (her baby died of sids at 4 months she just stopped breathing in her sleep and no one noticed)  but i wouldnt bother.  personally i wake up every 3 hrs whether or not my son wakes me and just have to check on him.  <br>  <br>  <br>  btw love the name my sisters youngest is named "harlie"<br>  <br>  oh ya and i had all my baby stuff at like 16 weeks.  :D|`|DLDweOcYaa	I've got an Angelcare baby monitor.  There is a pad that you put under the baby's mattress and if the baby deosn't move or breathe after 20 seconds it sounds an alarm.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	we got a night knight <br>  i used it for two weeks, now it sits in a drawer somewhere. it was pointless to us. it never chirped like the angel care one, but we just didn't use it, if it will give you piece of mind go for it though|`|2pxiK9waaa	Yes, it's WAY better than a regular baby monitor. It does sound AND breathing, so it's awesome. It's an angelcare baby monitor. They have it at Babies R Us. It gives you great peace of mind.

9hggEdf1aa	Yeah that is very normal.  My baby stopped moving aroudn too much aroudn the end of my pregnancy.  I guess its cuz there is not much room inside.  My baby was 6.10 lbs, I am pretty petite.  But if your baby gains too much weight I dont think it would make you have contractions.  Back labor feels like the baby is kicking or pushing from the inside, it is horrible, but the epidural can help!  Good luck with everything!|`|h3IjAuCgaa	They do get less active the closer you are to your due date !

KDb96QS7aa	Very differently. This is such a hot topic. I have not seen moms on other sections, but I have found the moms on this board tend toward the opinionated and judgmental end of the spectrum compared to those mommies I know in real life.<br>  Edit: It just struck me how ironic what I wrote above is. I come on this site to learn from others' experiences and share my own, not to force my opinion on the "right" way to mother is. Kind of makes me rethink any aspiration I had to be a "top contributor"! LOL!<br>  In regards to your working, I think it's probably like nursing in public. Unless you make a big deal about it, no one else will either. Maybe they're just jealous because you get "breaks" throughout the day (like a smoker or something). :)|`|SsfnitjXaa	Don't make a big deal about it at work and they won't comment.  Use your breaks and lunch to pump.  You should not be getting any more breaks just becaus you are pumping.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	There's a lot of ignorance about breastfeeding, at least that I've seen. I've had nasty comments made towards me, someone once told me that I was sexually abusing my daughter because I breastfed.....I didn't even know how to react!! And then you have other people who tell you formula is poison...which is ridiculous also. I've just given up. I don't really care what others think, I'm going to breastfeed my daughter & be the kind of mommy I believe I should be. Same goes with everyone else.
AFi5kTiEaa	I didnt start bottle feeding my kids untill about 2 months.  I would freeze breastmilk in 6,4 and 2oz's.  This way if they drank the 6 oz and still seemed hungry i could give them a bit more, i would use the 2oz bags for this.  I would save the 4oz bags for emergency's like if i was going to be home soon, just to tide them over and i would feed them as soon as i got home.  You need to get to know your little baby and how much he/she will eat.  I would tell your husband to give 4oz at this age and if he feels s he needs more then thaw the 2oz.  After a while you will know how much s he will eat in a feeding.  I guess it is trial and error at this point, in a few weeks you will know how much s he will take.<br>  <br>  I always combined the breastmilk and froze it.  I would just put it in the fridge for a while and then mix and freeze.<br>  <br>  You are lucky to already be able to pump milk when your baby is so young.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	1. take your baby's weight and multiply it by 2.5. then divide that number by the number of feeding your baby does in 24 hours. So if your baby is 15 lbs and has 8 feeding a day. 15 x 2.5 = 37.5 (ounces a day) 37.5/8 = 4.6875. the baby would get 4.5-5 ounces in a feeding. i would go with the higher amount at first, then lower the amount if need be.<br>  <br>  2. you can layer the same days pumping to be frozen, without a problem. even from two days, if you use the first day's date|`|vPhPitKyaa	Store as much as your baby usually eats.  You can leave it out for at least 4-5 hrs after thawed and reuse.  <br>  <br>  you can add more milk to some already in bag as long as it is cooled.  You don't want to add more warm milk then cooled milk.<br>  <br>  Visit the website below.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastpumps/milk.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/breastpumps/milk...</a>|`|g9vw4ovGaa	ok, breast milk is good in room temp for 8 hours, in the fridge for up to a week, and in the freezer for months. I pumped one breast and put it in one container and the other breast in another, it thaws quickly in hot water. I even fed my daughter milk that sat out for i think 10 hours on accident, and she was fine. If you pump then freeze, that milk will be good in the fridge for 24 hours.|`|avx7bLnKaa	thaw out at least 4oz if you are going to be gone during a feeding time and maybe leave some extra freshly pumped milk in the fridge as well... only heat 2-4oz at a time so you don't waste... if extra frozen milk is needed it can be thawed under warm running water<br>  <br>  and in regards to question 2... that is fine|`|BmwD4baxaa	It depends on your baby's age, ask your nursing consult to provide you with a chart showing age per ounce.  At 2 weeks my little man took 2 ounces in the bottle of breast milk.  You can also combine thawed breast milk with freshly pumped milk BUT it will only last a 24hr period.  Never wait for milk to cool before storing/freezing you will have a chance of bacteria to form.  Also if you go to your nursing consult they should be able to weigh your baby before feeding and then after to find out how much he/she is taking in, that might give you a better idea of how much to thaw out.
I8XndwVtaa	Well, first off, talk to her about WHY she is afraid to go the doctor. She may be afraid of the results, pain, embarrassment, or you finding out something she doesn't want you to know. If she doesn't want to tell you why she is afraid, cover all the bases here:<br>  If the results are scary, (for example a cancer diagnosis) finding out is better than not knowing, because you can treat it if you know what it is. (more than likely) and she may be cured, or have treatments that make the symptoms tolerable. (for something like asthma)<br>  If she is afraid of the pain, offer to give her some pain medication before the appointment. Your family doctor may be able to prescribe a sedative or a pain management medication for her to take prior to the appointment. <br>  If she is afraid of embarrassment, explain that doctors are very professional in their jobs. They have seen every body part that she has. Go through what will be done during the procedure or appointment and let her know how it will feel (if it's something you've been through personally)<br>  If she's afraid of you finding out something she doesn't want you to know, explain to her that the doctor can't tell you anything that the two of them talk about. Offer to wait for her in the waiting room so she can have that Dr. Patient confidentiality. BUT also offer to come in with her if she feels more comfortable with that. <br>  I hope that helps.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Tell her to go see the doctor. I'll drag her there if I have to. If there's something wrong with her health, I don't care how much she protests. She's seeing the doctor.|`|Zb7CtLxbaa	Try to comfort her. Also explain that it will only get worse if she doesn't see a doctor. Get some information up online if she doesn't believe what comes out of your mouth.|`|vnJG8UYJaa	You don't mention the age of the teenager or what the health threat is, so I'm not sure I can be of much help but I will try.<br>  <br>  If you already know that there is a major problem, I think information is the key.  Be honest with her so that she knows that she can trust you.  Do as much research as you can with her about her condition so that she is informed.  <br>  <br>  Reassure her that you will stay with her and be by her side.  Then, do not let anyone force you to leave her.  <br>  <br>  Talk to her about getting it over with.  For instance, after we get done at the appointment, we can stop at the new shopping mall down the street.  Make an appointment for a hair salon or nail salon that will be a treat for both of you after the appointment is over.<br>  <br>  First and foremost, you make the decisions.  Make the appointment and tell her that she is going, no ifs, ands, or buts.  It is simply not an option.<br>  <br>  If you think her fears are irrational, consider some counseling to figure out why she has this fear.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	It sounds like this isn't just A doctor it is THE doctor.<br>  You need to comfort her and let her know that YOU WILL BE THERE WITH HER. She will not be alone. Make it known that this is for her health and that you, as a parent, want her in the best of health possible because you love her. <br>  Also get the doctor that she is going to see involved as well. Inform the doctor that your daughter has some fears and if she can talk to her. That can sometimes help too. <br>  Also let her know that what she is feeling is completely NORMAL and it can be overcomed by the first visit.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Teach her to be brave by example. Going to a doctor is scary. But not going is even scarier. Take it from me. I hateeee going to the doctor's because everything is so clinical,and they always want to stick you with needles. But it's a small price to pay so they can find out what's wrong with you and get you healthy again,and in some cases keep you from dying.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	take her to the dr and hav them explain the benefit.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	Ask her why she's so afraid of the doctor.<br>  <br>  For me, I wont let my mom take me to any doctor whose male. I've had bad experiences with male doctors, and so has my family. <br>  <br>  When my mom gave birth to me, all the doctor was doing was sitting around watching the academy awards! And when I got cataract surgery as a baby, my doctor held me by the ankle in the office and ignored the fact I was screaming?<br>  <br>  An orthodontist I sued to go to was male and constantly shaking, and it looked like he was on crack! And my old male eye doctor fucked up my prescription so many times, it was ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Now I'm seeing all female doctors, and nothing is ever screwed up.<br>  <br>  Is she afraid of seeing an OBGYN? Tell her the possible consequences of not getting all that stuff checked. <br>  <br>  Does she not trust her doctor? Talk about that with her, and possibly get her a doctor. You shouldn't force a kid to see a doctor she can't trust, it's uncomfortable and makes the experience so much worse.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	Talk to her before she goes and make sure you go with her to the room. Don't stay out in the waiting room/lobby.  When it's over with ask her if she is comfortable. Does she have a male or female doctor?|`|NYJgiVxraa	comfort her about it, and then maybe she cna give the idea a shot or has to haha. and then they can get her checked out. tell her it may not b as bad as seh really thinks it is.|`|Jbkz18E8aa	bribe her lol

28WJwHf4aa	Tylenol. I have heard mixed responses on Tylenol PM; I avoided that just to be safe.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Tylenol is the only allowed by my doctor.<br>  <br>  You can try a heating pad for small amounts of time, body pillow, and staying off your back. I really think changing positions helps, but that may just be me lol.|`|AA12395149	Tylenol for pain during the day is considered safe.  Tylenol PM is also considered safe for the pain at night.  You can also try moist heat and/or ice packs.  Warm showers with the water focused on the area of pain can help.  <br>  <br>  An exercise you can do goes like this: go on all fours, suck in your abdomen as you inhale and curl your back up, exhale and release your abdomen as you flex your back.  Other gentle stretches can also help.|`|vVWycFZQaa	Tylenol (Acetominophen) is the only over-the-counter pain relief medicine that's ok to take during pregnancy. That means no Advil (Ibuprofen) even though it does work better. You can also take Tylenol PM during pregnancy, and that might help you get through the nights a little easier. Tylenol PM contains Diphenhydramine and Acetominophin, which are both safe to use during pregnancy.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	Tell someone to massage your back with their fist.  Using it in a circular motion on the lower back bone. This helped me out a lot. And when your in labor make sure you have someone to massage this way because when you go into labor it hurts worse. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|auDQxiu6aa	that might mean your stress level is up but to take it away i always put a heating pad on high on my back and slept that way......also you can relax in hot bath water to take it away.|`|Y2VsqIO7aa	Try sleeping on a side-lying position. It would ease the pressure from your back. Also, during the day, wear comfortable flat shoes. Don't wear heels because it causes a strain on the back. Although others have suggested medicines for you, Consult your doctor first if it's safe for you. Don't take any medicine without consulting your doctor. It could harm your baby.

I'm sorry but these diseases make these vaccines look like gold.|`|KyhnSRrJaa	ALL OF THEM!!!  There are lots more babies who are getting serious and life-threatening diseases because their moms did their own "research" and decided not to get their children vaccinated.  I just saw a story on the news the other day with a mother crying and saying how she'd give anything if she had gotten her son vaccinated, etc.  The story also said that the "research" linking vaccines with autism has since been disproven many times.<br>  <br>  Get the vaccines!

I assure that is more alarming. You really want a kid paralyzed from polio?<br>  Edit: The diseases these vaccines are meant to protect against are not gone. Please see this question I asked earlier.

I think I will vaccinate my next child but I plan on spreading them out a little bit and maybe delaying some of them, I just don't see how it can be healthy to pump so much into a small babies system all at once.

There are disease we thought were eradicated that are coming back now thanks to parents not getting the vaccines done. Trust me, the vaccines are a way better choice than the diseases!|`|edffl6oDaa	Good on you for researching! A lot of people will give you grief, but it is your right to choose. I have NOT vaccinated miss 12 weeks and I WILL NOT - I have been researching too. Most people who research this choose not to vaccinate, many people who do vaccinate have not researched and do it because its recommended and are scared to challenge authority. How many vaccinations have been pulled because later research proves they are not safe?! NO VACCINES ARE SAFE. Ask GPs - you'd be surprised how many docs choose not to vaccinate.<br>  <br>  Once again - good on you for looking out for the health of your child. Do some more research and decide. Dont be scared to stand up for what you believe.|`|Mh8pATk8aa	i've read a ton on this and have come to the conclusion that vaccines are safe. i'd say get them all. the only time i would question it is if my child had a rare allergic reaction to a vaccine in the past.<br>  <br>  there are people out there making money off scaring you into reading their books or magazines that preach anti-vax BS. don't buy into it, plzy. i almost regret wasting the time i have "researching" this stuff.<br>  <br>  email me if you want some reading material about vaccine safety.<br>  <br>  edit: do not trust that site lisa is talking about. that is the worst place in the world to get info. the people there are completely biased and misinformed and the whole website just exists to increase sales of some stupid parenting magazine via outrageous scare tactics. this is who i meant originally when i said there were people making money off this issue. haha.|`|MI7Vo2d5aa	The ones your doctor recommends.
AA12395149	Typical advice usually given to women includes avoiding strenuous exercise, prolonged standing, vacuum cleaning, stretching exercises and squatting. Women are also frequently advised to:<br>  <br>  Brace the pelvic floor muscles before performing any activity which might cause pain<br>  Rest the pelvis <br>  Sit down for tasks where possible (eg preparing food, ironing, dressing) <br>  Avoid lifting and carrying. <br>  Avoid stepping over things. <br>  Avoid straddle movements especially when weight bearing. <br>  Bend the knees and keep the legs 'glued together' when turning in bed and getting in and out of bed. <br>  Place a pillow between the legs when in bed or resting. <br>  Avoid twisting movements of the body. <br>  If the pain is very severe, using elbow crutches will help take the weight off the pelvis and assist with mobility. Alternatively, for more extreme cases a wheelchair may be considered advisable.<br>  <br>  Kegel exercises and belly belt should also help.|`|01vMpHkWaa	i started sleeping with a body pillow and not lifting my legs very high<br>  thats all i could figure out to help the pain<br>  i have had SPD since about 18 weeks. 39 now and it got worse. just take your time when doing activities that make it worse.

You can have a stillbirth after 20 weeks. Do you know how severe your bicornuate uterus is? I had one that was pretty severe and caused complications for me. However, most of my losses were in the first trimester. It sounds to me like it may not be so severe. Be prepared, your doctor may put you on bedrest later since you do run the risk of pre-term labor due to the baby not having space to continue growing. While mine was severe, there are plenty of women that have bicornuate uteri that are not severe at all and never experience any complications, it sounds like you are one of them.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	Having a bicorniate unterus it makes you more likely then other people to have preterm labor. They will probably do extra ultrasounds on you just to check the babies fluid levels. Don't worry unless you start to have contraction. If I were you I would make sure to drink lots of water. If you don't have enough water it can cause, contractions. You are out of the miscarriage time. You do need to be aware if you have contractions though if you do call the nurse at your doctors and ask what to do. If you do have to call make sure to tell them about your uterus. What is the extent of the bicorniate. Sometimes it is so much that there is to different uterus. I was an OB Ultrasound Tech if you need to talk you can email me. Just try to relax. You have made it this far which is a good thing. You can do it. Just think positive thoughts. Maybe you should go for very light walks to help ease your stress. I wouldn't recommend anything extreme.

Cx5Zo7IIaa	I set my daughter on a three hour schedule every three hours I would wake her up and feed her. Afterward I would try and keep her away at first only 15min, then longer and longer now she stays awake an hour and a half after she eats(she's two and half months old). I don't know if this will work for you maybe I just got lucky but my daughter is now sleeping through the night and has been for the last three weeks. Good luck on whatever you decide to try.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	You can always feed her early, if she's getting tired.  I did that with my baby.  If it hadn't been 2 hours, and she was getting sleepy, I'd go ahead and nurse her to sleep.  <br>  I answered your last question also, and like I said, don't stress about keeping to a strict schedule.  If your baby sleeps more than 3-4 hours, then you will probably want to wake her up.  I think I stressed too much about the schedule.  Looking back, there's a lot I'll do differently with the next one.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I never woke any of my kids up to feed them. If its been around 5 hours I would probably wake them, but they know when they are hungry. If they go longer in between feedings, they will probably just eat a little bit more than usual when they wake. Congrats!!!|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	A two and a half weeks she'll still "root" turn her head and open her mouth and rub her fist near/in her mouth when she's hungry (and trust me with a few weeks, you'll know the different cries). Awake alert time will increase as she gets older. If it's nighttime awake time, just keep the lights dim and do calm singing and rocking so she knows there's a difference between day and night.<br>  <br>  It is 2-3 hours measuring start feed to start feed.<br>  Also, on the long nursing sessions... if she's nursing while she is sleeping (dream feeding) take notice of her jaw and throat. Is she swallowing she's still nursing, but babies like to fake thier mamas out and kind of pretend nurse for comfort. if this is the case, you may want to put your finger in her mouth, and break the latch (and switch to a pacifier if you're using them)<br>  <br>  best of luck, congrats on breastfeeding. you're doing great!!!!|`|kgE96Nhcaa	At two and a half weeks feeding her every two to three hours is normal, if she last ate at 6:15 she will probably eat again, you can at least offer it to her.|`|lUSj480Oaa	They always told me to feed my daughter every 2-3 hours. How often does she usually eat? If I were your I'd see if she wants to eat now. If not then wake her up in another hour to try again. No need to worry.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	You should wake her to feed her at this age. She's too young to go for more than 4 hours without eating. Her blood sugar can drop and it can be dangerous. We didn't let our baby sleep through a feeding until she was three months. When my baby was that age, she ALWAYS fells asleep at the boob. LOL it's just comfortable for them to do so. The way I approached it was to make her uncomfortable so I would strip her naked and tap on her until she would nurse. Most of the time she moving your nipple around or gently touching her face will do the job.|`|O5DPuy3daa	I feed my 5 wks old every 3 hours, when he was brand new i was feeding him every 2-3, i did wake him and i would suggest that you do as the more you feed during the day the more likely you are to get a long (4/5 hr) sleep at night .<br>  I would feed her now and see if she well go off to sleep.  If she doesnt then take her into a quiet dark room and see if that helps.  Babies can get overtired and then they find it really hard to go to sleep.  YOu will know the signs soon.<br>  Good luck and hey no question is a stupid question.. Your doing a great job.|`|ciD5JxPRaa	I have breast feed both my daughters & our new 4 week old. I can tell you from experience they will eat when they are ready & as she gets older she will stay awake longer to look around; it's completely normal. As far as when you should feed or how often it depends on how much milk you produce as well. My newest addition would wake up every 2 hrs to nurse and would nurse for about 30 mins because I was not making that much milk. Hopefully you will not have that problem.<br>  <br>  Believe me they will wake up when they get hungry you don't have to wake her up. You may want to if you get to full though. LOL|`|g9vw4ovGaa	No no no, you don't ever wake her to feed her, ever! Let her sleep, she could be getting to the point where she can go 4 hours without feeding. The older she gets the more awake she will be throughout the day. I know you're worried about a routine and all that jazz, but honey from one mom to another, one day will be totally different from the next, no point to even bother with a routine until they're at least a few months old. I learned my lesson the hard way. On another note, stop trying to be perfect, you're gonna screw up a time or two, thats what makes you human. Do what you feel is best, don't listen to books, and follow the little voice God gave all women, called a mothers instict!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I didn't breast feed, and there is a four hour rule for formula feeding.  If she's still wide awake, then watch her.  If she begins to show signs of calming down, or getting tired, then feed her.  That way there she won't get hungry, and will sleep for a little while on a full belly, and you wont have to wake her up.  Congrats by the way!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	you dont have to wake her to feed her <br>  she knows and will wake up when shes hungry
4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Fertility centers make you sign documents to determine this very type of thing beforehand.<br>  <br>  I think it's pretty rare for this to happen. First of all not all IVF cycles result in enough leftover embryos to freeze. Secondly the couple would have to split up prior to using all the embryos.<br>  <br>  It's up to the couple if they want to have one spouse keep them (or even split them), destroy them, donate them to science, or donate them to another couple struggling with infertility.|`|UrAeAYRFaa	I believe that, If you are referring to an egg not<br>  yet growing, the two should scrap the whole issue,<br>  slit the cost, if there is any, No baggage, no head games,No torturing the poor kid by playing one against the other, fresh start for everyone...|`|S5Lsbh0taa	It takes child custody battles to whole new level don't you think.|`|xNY9sgUBaa	When we did in vitro we were informed that, without a court order, the embryos would be disposed of in such a case. I have heard of people getting their embryos when they divide their "belongings" in divorce court. It sounds awful but it does happen. Laws have not kept up adequately with science.|`|diecro36aa	I don't think either of them should use it unless the other agrees to it.
KyhnSRrJaa	That same thing happened to me.  When I was just pregnant, I couldn't stand the smell of food - especially raw meat.  I never had morning sickness, but the smell just disgusted me.  That didn't last long, though.  I'm 14 weeks now, and have no problems with it.  I still sometimes don't feel like eating certain things, but the absolute disgust does pass.  As for energy, I'm just now starting to get my energy back.  I was so tired, I think I maybe cooked 2 or 3 times during the entire first 3 months I was pregnant.... my poor husband!  <br>  <br>  Don't worry... the food aversion will pass soon, and the exhaustion should start getting better by the end of your first trimester (3 months).<br>  <br>  Congratulations, and good luck :)|`|1c436cc1733bf8de5a0ab59717a9f96caa	Congratulations!!<br>  <br>  However sorry to be the bringer of bad news. Sounds like you have the beginnings of morning sickness. As part of this stage of the pregnancy, and a symptom of morning sickness, is that you will have a increased sense of smell and things that have never bother you or were just irritating before will be just intolerable. The tiredness is also another sign.<br>  <br>  Morning sickness usually starts at around five or six weeks of pregnancy and improves for most women by 14 weeks. So you sound like you are right on track. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope your morning sickness doesn't get too bad :)|`|8zdPI8Qsaa	I'm 8 weeks along with my second, and though I'm sick morning til night, my food aversions aren't quite as strong as last time. While pregnant with my now 17 month old, I couldn't be anywhere near meat without gagging or throwing up. I couldn't really eat much in general, but definitely couldn't be around the smell or sight of any kind of meat (especially beef) til about 20 weeks. Even then it took til about 22 weeks before I started eating it again. It was the middle of winter, and I remember my poor husband trying to cook himself dinner, while I gagged in bed with the door shut, and windows wide open (once during a snow storm) to try to get that smell out of my house. I soo know where you're coming from. Anywho, for many women food aversions really dissipate at 12-14 weeks. Good luck :-)|`|AA12395149	Food aversion is very normal in early pregnancy.  I love seafood, but the site of anything other than shrimp made me go blehk!  There were some other food items that just the thought of made me ill.  Just find what you like and stick with that.  As long as you are eating plenty of fresh fruits, veggies, lean meats and whole grains, you and your baby will be fine.<br>  <br>  best of luck and congrats!|`|kkwg2KNcaa	try browsing babycenter.com I go there for most of my questions. I'm 6 weeks along as well and I can't even think of any type of food. No morning sickness either, just no appetite. From what I've learned food aversion is normal and should lighten up in a few more weeks.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Alot of pregnant women can get like that i cant stand watching people cook meat it makes me feel like im going to be sick. I never had morning sickness but because your sense of smell is worse when your pregnant it can make you go off alot of food, for some people it goes for others its not. Mines isnt too bad i can eat meat and things but i cant look at it being cooked or smell it, the joys lol
AA10556677	Some (like the one's that you're talking about) teenagers are so arrogant, they actually convince themselves that they DO want to die at the moment they're saying it, because they're so egotistical that it hasn't occurred to them that other people have the same problems. They think that everything that happens to them is unique, and thus worthy of "dying" over.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Because its there way of running from their problems.<br>  Avoiding them.<br>  Edit: To below <br>   | <br>   |<br>  V<br>  True, I have.

He crashed an ATV into a tree.  I really hate when people mock suicide.  <br>  <br>  It just puts worry into the people that care about you when you talk like that.  I think it's ridiculous that it's such a fad to want to die.  And cutting yourself has become a fad as well...since when is self mutilation "cool"? :||`|kRaVa0Wraa	okay, calm down.<br>   theyre just being over dramatic... nooo big deal.|`|ynAXDyQDaa	I think they're just drama queens who want attention. <br>  I'm 15 and I definitely do not want to die yet!<br>  My life has barely even begun.|`|p25p9jTYaa	they're drama queens/kings|`|iG6ksSpHaa	Maybe to some of us teens who lives are hard dieing seams like escaping. We don't always know how to continue. We're scared and we want it to stop. We can't make it stop we are just children. Meaning we control nothing about our lives. We must do as we are told. School is some days so painful when you don't belong anywhere Teens might think of wanting to die to end it, once and for all. To never have to cry again and never have to feel again. For it just to be over. It isn't right and a lot of teens say it without meaning it I'm sure. Still, there are some who really do want to die sometimes. You just used example of people who probably didn't mean it.|`|vYgJMybeaa	Do you know how corrupt this world is...? Do you know unfair this world is...?<br>  <br>  People in many countries cannot afford to eat, while others have more than enough. This is unfair. Some people feel they dont deserve to live.<br>  <br>  If you had no friends and it seemed as if nobody cared about you and you felt extremely guilty about EVERYTHING you did, you probably would want to die.<br>  <br>  It takes tremendous effort to get out of bed EVERY DAY. You're scared to leave the house. You're scared to answer the phone. You're just existing; not really living. When you're dead, you dont have to through the pain anymore of living every day life, feeling incompetent of everything you do.  You are horrible at social situations and do not fit in socially at all. You've been ridiculed your whole life and cannot deal with being a drain on everyone else. You cant get a job. <br>  <br>  And the only reason you keep living is because it would be selfish to die. If not emotionally, perhaps financially. What if you didn't want people to have to pay your funeral bills? You just feel so guilty. It's not because your life sucks; it's just that you have no purpose to live.

AA10943329	My son did exactly the same at 17 months. It has taken years (he is 10 almost) and he only started eating better at about 7. Stay on her trying to get her to eat as i would hate for you to have to go through what I am. Up & Go is fine for breakfast but not throughout the day. Just keep gicing what you normally give. Stay away from any junk. If she can't eat fruit, yogurt and sanwiches, meat and veg then she can't have anything else.<br>  <br>  Just read all the answers. Don't stress too much unless you think she is sick. Elijah survived on 2 weetbix in the morning and a sandwich at lunch and a small tub of yogurt for 2 years. Same thing everyday. I talked to the Health Centre Sister and she said that it is our job as the mother to provide the food and their job to eat it. I cannot tell you all the battles we had over food. If I could go back I would not have battled as much as I did. But even to this day he would rather go hungry than eat something he doesn't want to. Whoever said "they will eat if hungry" did not have my son. I tried saying "If you don't like tea then you can go to bed" he then started walking past the bench as I dished up, look at tea and said "goodnight" and put himself to bed. How do you fight that???|`|ENANtueuaa	She might not be feeling well. Maybe she's teething, does she have her eye teeth yet? They usually come on around 18 months. I'd take her to the doctor, at 17 months i don't think she's being stubborn by not eating. Good luck!|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Considering it has been 4 days you should take her to the DR...Im usually pretty nice when answering questions, but seriously? If she hasnt hardly eaten anything at all but a few bites in 4 days, its time to get her to the DR!

It does not cause bleeding in all women only about a third, and it can be accompanied with some cramping. the best thing to do is to check your dates and if this is when you expected your period to begin i would wait untill the bleeding ends and take a pregnancy test anyway just to make sure,|`|w1drJWKAaa	Implantation bleeding is when the egg plants itself on the uterine lining.

In "most" cases, that is a bit of a difference. <br>  <br>  However. I was 17, and my husband 22 when we married, 18, and 23 when we had our first child. 19, and 24 when we bought our home.<br>  <br>  I have been faithfully with him since I was 15 years old. Now at 22 we have a life many spend their whole life trying to obtain....it's all a matter of life, goals, choices, capabilities, and dedication. Simple as that. Plenty of 80 year old people couldn't do what we have at our ages (now 22, and 27). Same as plenty people younger than us are doing better than we are. <br>  <br>  Age is simply a number put to over analyze expectations. When you exceed those expectations 10 fold....it's nothing more than a degrading number.|`|c534219f52edbcbf0ed54e53501afdebaa	I have always believed that love isn't a number but if your child is 17 years old and dating a person 6 years older than them. You might want to step in and say hey you want to date anybody that much older than you then you wait until you turn 18 years old. When you are an adult. Who knows what might happen in that sort of situation. You might end up with a grandbaby. So just explain and try not to do it in a way that would upset them. I would get them both together and talk to them both so they BOTH get the whole story. And your opinion about the situation.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Usually yes.  but not necesarily.  We have 16 yr old girls and they are not interested in guys their own age, they are too immature.  they are always meeting guys in their early 20's at the swimming pool and just talking, but the few times that they went beyond a friendship and wanted a dating relationship we insited the guys come over for dinner and a getting to know him session.  ONe time our daughter outright liked about his age...he was 24 not 22 as she had said and I'd gotten this imfo from someone else before he arrived, so when I questioned him and got the truth, out the door he went and she got severly punished for her lieing and taught about the dangers of her behavior.  But, on the occasion the guy passes the initial test , the rules are that they can only talk at the pool, eat dinner together at the fast food rest. she works at or spend time together in OUR home with at least one of us there....until for as much as a year, that we trust him as a descent guy that will not lead our daughter astray or put her in harms way or do anyting to hurt her, like rape etc.  So, I think it can be ok if the girl is mature enough and you have stiff ground rules.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	Depends on the maturity of the people and how independent they are. I graduated high school and moved out at 17 and dated a 25 year old. I think it was okay for a little while, but I don't think it would work for long term. People just still have so much growing and changing to do post-age-17. Also post-age-22 for that matter.|`|XpoJkke6aa	No I know some people nine years apart and my parents are 14 years apart and they are happily married, though the without background thing is a little weird, but i think you mean hypothetically, but only five years apart is not that bad. there you go.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I think unless that's a very immature 22 year old, they are in very different stages of life and maturity.  I'd be more comfortable with a five year age gap in a couple years.

cTk9nbvRaa	1. I would probably give you a trial run (based on your experience with babysitting), and after a couple nights of watching my children if you do a really good job and my kids like you, then yes I would hire you!<br>  <br>  2. Fliers are an AWESOME way for business, so I really think you should think twice about not wanting to do them.  Even if you do just a few and post them in grocery stores, banks, and your local child daycare centers.  The best way is word of mouth (people talking about how good you are), but you need to get your name and experience out there.  Maybe ask your teachers if they have children that you could watch, or even people at your church (if you attend church that is).<br>  <br>  3. While you are waiting for your dad's friends, just keep trying to babysit other kids.  Maybe occasionally call them up and see if you could babysit on an upcoming Friday or Saturday night.  Just keep them from forgetting that you want a chance, but don't call too often because you don't want them to get annoyed.<br>  <br>  4.  As for the daycares, I think they would let you help out during your breaks or on your days off.  Just go in and see what they say.  If one place says no, don't let it get you down.  Go to every daycare center in your area and ask them all.  Also if you go to church, ask to help out in the childcare or ask to help out in the younger kids classes.  This is a great idea, and also a great way to get yourself known!  <br>  <br>  Another idea is for you to make a resume with your experience on it.  Have your parents or teachers help you to make it professional and perfect.  Then you would have something to give the parents that are interested in hiring you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and keep it up!!|`|nzgZR6onaa	No I would not hire you because you did not mention you had a first aid course or know cpr.I had 5 kids 4 of them girls and my first rule was they all had to have a basic first aid course and know CPR before I would let them babysit. When there is a medical emergency and we don't know what to do the first thing of course dial 911 we may do the wrong thing  in a panic..So many people react and do the wrong thing and can make a medical situation worse.Then I want references of course and then I look for the other good qualities. Oh you can call your local RedCross because they offer the basic first aid and CPR all the time.That is where my kids were taught.Good Luck!
DDIBEvUTaa	I don't really agree with that.  WIC, maybe just to help buy groceries, but I don't agree with people getting money to spend on whatever.  I would like to think that the majority of people who get govt assistance but it to good use, but I've known people who spent it on TVs and other unneccesary things.  I have friends who have worked opposite shifts from their spouse to stay home.  I stay at home & work some weekends.  We don't receive govt assistance.  We also don't go out, we are as quite frugal when it comes to groceries & such.  We buy many items secondhand.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	i'm a bring your baby to work with you mom. and while i could stay at home and get food stamps and welfare. i choose to work (i nanny). and bring my baby with me (because i would never consider putting my child in childcare of any sort before they can talk and tell me if there is a problem). i get government assistance (the WIC program) to HELP me a bit, but i don't feel i mooch off of taxpayers. i can't afford childcare and i've seen the government assisted childcare, and would NEVER consider it for my son.|`|52bAHCaUaa	That does seem unfair.<br>  <br>  I am a SAHM. My husband makes enough where I can stay home. But not enough to where we are living rich or anything! My daughter is on medicaid, and I was on pregnancy medicaid. Also we have WIC. That is the only help we get though. <br>  <br>  It came down to either I can stay home and watch her, or we can pay someone the same amount of money I was making to watch her. So, I am staying home!!|`|ENANtueuaa	Yes, it is unfair. A lot of states seem to favor single parenting. If you are a single mother, you get food stamps, welfare, childcare assistance, free housing, free medical and detal (for the children and YOU), etc....but if a married couple both lose their jobs, good luck trying to get anything, if you're lucky, you'll get food stamps. The state does this, and yes people do take advantage of it. But, the state needs to re-evaluate what's going on, and how many single women are actually lying about their income and purposly staying single, just because they don't want to lost their assistance. In the case of the other lady, purposly not returning to worn, just because she wont get anymore assistance!<br>  <br>  Personally, i work...always have. Even when i was a single mom! I got a job at a daycare, so my daughter could be in the same building as me! Now, i'm TTC baby #2, and would LOVE to be a stay at home mom. Luckily this time, i'm married and my wonderful husband says that will probably be possible. Still not sure i'd do it, because we're still going to be tight on money, and he'll have to work extra hours! I agree with you though, it's very unfair!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	I am a SAHM, I however do not live off of government assistance. My husband makes enough that it's not a problem. It's people like you mentioned that make it so much harder for those who do need it to get it. If you need it take it, that's why it's there. If you can work (esp. if you can find work right now!) then you should as opposed to staying at home and living off of something that isn't guaranteed to be there tomorrow.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Same here.  My husband also works really long hours for me to be able to stay home with our children.  I need to get a job but I keep putting it off.  I want to work part time from 6-11pm so i can be at home all day and daddy can put them to bed.<br>  <br>  Sorry your baby is sick, it must be so hard not to be with her.|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	SAHM here (fiance works btw). I hope she does go on assistance, she'll see how bloody difficult life can be.<br>  <br>  Edit: Hey TD, ever been on assistance before? You'd know what I'm saying if you had. Also I'm from the highest taxed nation in the world so I've paid my share.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I hate moochs,<br>  it makes me sick.<br>  <br>  im a sahm mom, but my husband works his *** off to make it possible|`|1Si9RlEXaa	I am a SAHM but my husband provides everything for us! We don't get a cent from the government, but we sure pay in a lot so people can sit can sit back and collect their money and laugh at us "idiots" working people when they have it so easy. My husband and I agree, it's very unfair. We always say if we didn't get married instead of doing it the right way then we could be getting so many hand out and he wouldn't have to work his tail off to support his family. But that's life, we will always being carrying the weight of lazy self centered people!|`|LMc23g9Maa	There are plenty of people who think that babies should be with their mothers until they are at least 3 years-old and also quite a few who think that as long as they get money to stay home, well why work?<br>  <br>  The government allows that by delivering welfare and there is nothing we can do about it.  It only really annoys me when those people on welfare whinge that they don't "earn" enough. I was shocked the first time I heard a single mum talk about her "payday" i.e the day the pension is put into her bank account.  I nearly said "Payday is for people who work, you know."|`|rAkWoweOaa	If someone asked that, then they are not privilaged, they are poor and that is not a good quality of life. Be glad that you have a job and don't need assistance. Me and hubby pay plenty of taxes and I am glad to know they are there if there comes a day when we really need it. I am a SAHM, only because my husband made sure of it. We saved and bought cattle so we could sell the calves for profit and land as an investment to get us through his young years until I can go back to work. My income used to be a huge factor, but a lot of planning really helped pay off.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Nothing pisses me off more than a friggin moocher!<br>  <br>  I hate people who get Goverment assistance when they can afford to buy cigarettes and beer, and wear expensive clothes, and live the life of riley! If they can do that ****, then they can either suffer financially like most SAHM do, or they can get a job and quit mooching off of taxpayers money!<br>  <br>  It is definately unfair! People are so damn lazy these days. My husband works his *** off in order for me to be able to stay home with our daughter and we dont receive any kind of goverment assistance! Nor, would we ever take it. I would get a job before I took goverment assistance! You just have to ignore ignorant people such as that woman......|`|sK67bBy5aa	Thats makes me sick also! <br>  <br>  My husband works away 20 days at a time so I can stay home and raise our children! He has to be away from me and the kids for 20 friggin days! <br>  <br>  And all our taxes go to a lot of people that are too lazy to work. I know there is a many precentage of people that need he help, but others lie to get it!|`|g9vw4ovGaa	SAHM not by choice, we suffer financially for it, but I wouldn't trade a few extra dollars a month to not see my daughter grow|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i sahm bc my hub works....no assistance from taxpayers|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	No.  I believe it is important to be a role model for my children, and that you take care of your responsibilities.
7rCeCVl2aa	Never give details. Kids just want facts. Answer ONLY the questions they ask and don't lead it any deeper. As they get older the questions will get bigger and you can reveal more. Never lie to them. Most important NEVER bad mouth him. They will learn that on their own.<br>  <br>  My husband adopted my 7 year old last July. His birth father has never been there. The adoption catapulted a series of questions from him. As I mentioned above I only answer what he asks and I don't bring it up any other time. He has been perfectly satisfied with the short version of any of his questions. The truth though is I really wanted to tell him what a worthless piece of crap his birth father is. He'll figure that out on his own though later down the road.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best. As a mother having dealt with something similar I know how hard it is. Trust me the first time they ask it will practically paralyze you. =)|`|vjsT8DMIaa	you know...you'll never know until you get there. I had my first when I was 18....and her father left me. She's now almost 6 years old...and has never once questioned about him.  Now, I must say I met my now husband, when she was 2...and he has raised her since then, and she's always taken to calling him daddy, however she knows he's not her real father. She in inter-racial, and my husband and our two kids together are white. She'll just make comments like "Im the only brown person in our house"....but I just tell her we are all people, and she's brown like her father is....but she's never questioned him. I think the day she does....I will give her his information, and she can call him or whatever and make her own judgment on him. I try to never bad mouth him in front of her...even though I really do hate his guts. He's been out of her life pretty much her whole life.<br>  <br>  I don't know why some crappy men do things like that to their children....but I just look at it like every minute he's not there, and with every passing year....thats time he can never get make, and never make up for. She'll realize when she gets old enough to make her own judgments.|`|b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	Once they are old enough you can tell them the truth.  You don't have to taint his name by adding excess details and feelings.  They will figure it out on their own.<br>  <br>  When they are little ones you tell them that Daddy didn't know what angels they were and he got scared and had to run away.|`|33h5R8nTaa	For now just tell them Daddy went away if they ask, if they dont then dont say anything. when they get older and can understand things better tell them the truth. never put bad thoughts of him in there head tho because ifone day he wants to meet them they need to have an open mind about it.|`|Mr6U1TiHaa	he's an asshole!!!  one day he will reget it...put him on child support.   i dont know what you should tell your kids.. i would really lo ve to help but thats a very serious and delicate situation.....the only thing i know is that you shouldn't talk bad about their father infront of them...good luck..he's missing the best part of his life he should go to hell|`|KyhnSRrJaa	I would tell them as much of the truth as possible, depending on how old they are when they ask of course.  And also, not saying anything that would hurt them.<br>  <br>  I would just say, "You're daddy didn't want to be with mommy anymore.  Daddy is doing other things right now, but mommy loves you very much and will never leave you, I'll always be here for you, etc."<br>  <br>  I would try not to badmouth him (even though he sounds like scum) because that may make your daughters resent you.  Let them form their own opinion of him, and if he continues to never be around for them or be a part of their life, I'm sure their opinion will not be a good one.  It's just better that it's their opinion and not yours.|`|RPoFBenJaa	chances are, your kids wont ask about him until they are old enough to be told the situation. If I was you I would get a consult with a child therapist about what you could tell them. Not bring them to one, just ask a therpist what you could tell them so as not to traumatize them and make them feel unwanted ya know? That would probably be best, and it would be easier on you.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	You know something, if it were me, I would say that, well hell I don't even know what I would say. Just wait til the time that they ask, and come up with something out of your a$$. Hell I don't know. Thats a tough question honey and I truly do feel for you, maybe one day he'll realize what he missed out on|`|iPEv1lRBaa	I would just tell them that families come in all shapes and sizes.  Some mommies and daddies live together and some don't.|`|AA10914343	the TRUTH|`|n6XYYyoLaa	go to court, file for support, they will make him take a paternity test and then he will have to help you with the kids....financially at least; i am not sure what to tell them, i guess it really depends on how old they are when they ask...i wouldn't make it sound like he didn't want them even if that is the truth; put some thought into it and try to say it in a way that is truthful but as easy for them to take...and age appropriate; i think u have a while before they ask....gl
ENANtueuaa	Depends on when the appt is next week. If it's Wed Thurs or Fri, then i'd take her to a walk in clinic. Has she been sick? It's commen for kids to cough and throw up, but i've never heard of sneezing and throwing up. She might have alot of mucus in her sinuses, and sneeing triggers her to throw up. The mucus has to come out somehow. Either coughed up or thrown up, which is what kids usually do. I'd difinately get her in to see the doctor. Good luck!|`|BqqDJXkjaa	Try some Mylanta - she may have a reflux problem - if she's throwing up more than once a day for 3-4 days in a row, I would be worried enough to take her to the dr. Is she happy before and after??|`|jH8hIB0kaa	The key thing that you need to do is to make sure that she does not dehydrate. Peidolite and gator aid.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Sneeze and then throw up? That's new to me. Does she have any known allergies? Dust,pollen,anything? Could be the sneezing is stressing her body,which causes her to be sick.
Dx8eudXfaa	At 29 months, he does not need to drink or eat anything during the night. It might be contributing to his wakefulness, all those liquids. What is he drinking? <br>  3 hours is a long nap for a 2 year old. Cut it back to 1-1.5 hours. Wake him up if need be. (Note: this process will be a little difficult for both of you, but worth it at the end!) <br>  Have a soothing bedtime routine, beginning at 6:30 pm. Bath, books, and then lights out at 7.<br>  If he cries, check on him but do not pick him up. Tell him it's bedtime, and then don't speak to him after that. In the middle of the night, I honestly wouldn't do anything for him. He will begin to learn he cannot have attention then, it's night time, and he will go back to sleep. <br>  He is not crying due to bad dreams, I really doubt that. He is crying because he's getting attention when he does so. He gets plenty of your attention and love during the day, and he will be OK without it- better than OK- if he doesn't get it at night. It will show him that night time is sleep time.|`|RSczEcZCaa	I think when kids who are mostly very active during the day have trouble sleeping through the night. i also notice this with my boys when they have to play nonstop when their friends or cousins come to visit. they would usually be half-awake crying and shouting about something. so i suggest you cut his naptime by half so he can sleep longer during the night. and see how it goes. that's what i did with my very hyper boys, hope it'll work with yours too.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	Firstly, he's playing you on the sippie (Im assuming this is a drink?). He needs nothing and will stop waking for it after you stop bringing it to him. <br>  <br>  I would cut the nap in the afternoon - make it 30mins only then get him up. He is probably waking up crying for 2 reasons - 1: he always falls asleep when you are then, then wakes up alone. He needs to fall asleep by himself. and 2: He is tired! <br>  <br>  When he wakes up stop giving him the drink and don't be so attentive. Make sure he falls asleep by himself (read about control crying). <br>  Stop making it so worth his while!!!

At least wait till highschool and yes it is normal!|`|4ASENeVWaa	well your just 14 and its so normal besides i have to say but my advice date when your in high school|`|MOMme2k6aa	wait till h.s when you find a guy u wanna date thats wen u should date him.|`|jMD5Qm5Waa	its very normal and you should probably wait till high school|`|atrObg5saa	it is very normal, don't worry|`|xWsjKhCdaa	it's completely normal...just wait...you will find someone later in your life...good things come to people who wait|`|aqto0hJTaa	Just wait.  You've got plenty of time.|`|FpeEJbhaaa	Yes, it's perfectly normal - and if you're dissatisfied with the options, why would you pursue them?  Sit back, relax, and let life take it's course.|`|nZVmkZSBaa	It's perfectly normal. Don't go out with someone just for the sake of going out with someone. Wait until someone that you actually like comes your way. You sound fine to me. =]<br>  Good luck. x.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	Im 14 and i've never had a bf ... i've never even kissed someone LOL<br>  i know i sound like a loser ... but im wating till high school cause all the guys in my grade are ugly and stupid. LOL|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	completely, absolutely and definitely!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	just wait. =)|`|o4lPQjrGaa	Yes, its normal. And it's better that way. Trust me you will be much happier when you get to high school because you can date guys in older grades without looking bad because you're in middle school dating a highschooler (which i think is just stupid and wierd) SO i say just wait a little longer.!|`|aMHIA7XMaa	It's perfectly normal to not have had a boyfriend at 14. Hell, I waited until I was 17 to date. If all the boys in your school are too immature for you, don't lower your standards just so you can have a date - wait until you meet someone worthy of your time.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	There are more important things in life for you to be worrying about than dating.  Concentrate on those things rather than some silly boys.  You have PLENTY of time to experience the dating world.  At only 14, its perfectly normal to not have had any kind of dating relationships.|`|RESEYeVlaa	haha thats fine! omg yeah i am in 8th too and the guys are going to be verrry imature.<br>  just wait till highschool! you have ur whole life to find someone special!<br>  <br>  also girls always mature faster than boys so they are going to be imature until like 9th or 10 grade!|`|BDtTWVIUaa	this generation sickens me. even though I'm part of it... **** that. I haven't dated a decent guy in a year because all the guys I know are asswholes.|`|vYgJMybeaa	I'm 18 and I've never gone out with anyone.<br>  <br>  I stay at home all day.|`|q34vCB3Qaa	wait til hs. it's very normal.|`|urs9AxiGaa	yes its normal|`|pTERJdzQaa	Yes, of course it is normal, there is no law saying that you have to have someone before or after a certain age.<br>  <br>  And that does not make you a nerd or outcast, In my opinion I think that you should stay single to avoid the drama and the tension.<br>  <br>  I am 15 years old and I have been single for 15 years, so I have whent longer than you have without a love partner, and Im ok, nothing has happened to me, I live a good life.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	No, my first boyfriend, which included my first kiss and first date was 17. I got a few offers, but didn't want to go for the first loser to ask me out. You should wait until you find the person you feel a true connection with.  Don't just go out with someone just to do it. It's been 3 years and I am still with and in love with my first boyfriend and we're expected a baby in May, and we couldn't be happier.|`|9sGBIx2Aaa	Of course it's normal. If it makes you feel any better, my sister is 15, almost 16 and she hasn't even kissed anybody! And I think she is very pretty, and likable. So you will be fine! Take your time!|`|TRogTUQnaa	It's normal.  Guys in middle school can hardly take you out because they don't cars or jobs.  When you get into high school, you'll go out.  For now just hang out, make friends, and do whatever.|`|UKIJ6hzLaa	Just wait because changing who u are will not help the problem, u probably won't be as happy if u are not being urself|`|sVg4Qco0aa	There's no such thing as normal. Don't worry about having a boyfriend, you're only 14.|`|3XDr0EiSaa	All my friends are 14 and most them haven't gone out with anyone totally normal.|`|JLBuXqStaa	Its very normal<br>  Ive had 2 boyfriends and regret both [not that we DID anything, it was just stupid]|`|uYDoPNv9aa	yes hun its totally fine.<br>  dont go out with someone u dont like.<br>  ur only suppose to date people u love,dating is no game and its not popular.|`|ynuLj6IYaa	YES very normal|`|YMXdE0Vzaa	Dude I got my first girlfriend and kiss all in freshman year.|`|WvBgXv5daa	its normal bc your not ready to dateeeeee|`|TYxbaE4paa	just wait till high school.<br>  why would you want to date an immature little 8th grader..or as you put it.|`|5t1Gx6ASaa	im 14 and i havent had a girlfriend or even kissed a girl<br>  But I am a geek/nerd type so i dont know|`|V5pFYbOeaa	I'm in high school and I still haven't had a bf so I think you'll be ok for a while!|`|UIgDmhnIaa	yes, its perfectly fine.
rz88Flzzaa	i have a bachelor's degree in dietetics/nutrition. if your body mass index is below 18, it may be cause for you not being able to get pregnant right now. you can calculate your BMI using a BMI calculator online. good luck!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bmi-calculator/NU00597" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bmi-cal...</a>|`|LMc23g9Maa	No, I am normally about 6 kilos (13 pounds) underweight and over 35.

You should ask your doctor what you can do to help your infertility.|`|lnaAn55Raa	depends on how underweight you mean.

YwHl37Hgaa	Each woman is different where morning sickness cures are concerned. What works for one, may or may not work for another. Here  you will find some useful tips  which you can try and hope it helps. More instant remedies and info at <a href="http://usefulinfomorningsickness.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://usefulinfomorningsickness.blogspo...</a>|`|BzCYQlcuaa	well i am 7 going on 8 weeks and morning sickness is getting worse! i found many things!<br>  <br>  A) at my bed side i leave a ginger ale and saltines for the am.<br>  B) fresh ginger ( got at the super market) and put this in food like STR fry<br>  <br>  C) ginger snaps ( keep them in my purse) <br>  D) six small meals a day ( instead of 3 lager)<br>  E) changing my prenatal vitamins<br>  F) not standing up to quickly ( after naps, sitting for long period of time)|`|HOdblqIkaa	crackers, chicken broth, lots of water, the kinds of things you eat when your sick. my boyfriend would bring me crackers in the morning before i got up so i could eat them and have something in my stomach before i tried getting up to start the day, which is normally when the sickness kicked in the most.|`|AA11763588	You can try the BRAT diet:<br>  <br>  Bananas<br>  Rice<br>  Apples (no skin, that will upset the belly)<br>  Toast (dry or unsalted crackers)<br>  <br>  Keep up on fluids: Water, 100% Fruit Juice or Gatorade<br>  <br>  Or try some B6 pills, you can get them OTC.|`|fE5zMOfJaa	Zofran didn't work for me either which is so weird 'cause a lot of women call it the miracle pill!  But I guess everyone's bodies are different.<br>  Nothing else seemed to work either.  I just had to make sure I ate often & rested a lot!  Don't push yourself to do much....just take it easy & if you can, take naps.  Because the nausea will only get worse if you're tired.<br>  I'm in my 14th week & the nausea has subsided a little but it's definitely still there.  <br>  If you're anything like me, the morning sickness has probably effected you a lot emotionally!  The only relief is knowing that there will be an end to it!  I hope it goes away for you real soon!|`|9hggEdf1aa	Morning sickness may be caused becasue you are hungry, I used to put grapes and a can of whipped cream on my night stand.  Also if you vomit everytime you eat then do not eat.   I was able to eat in the morning, but after around 1 pm I had difficulty holding down food.  So I would be careful with what I eat and only ate very little at a time.  Also if your vomit has froth in it, it means you are trying too hard to vomit.  If you feel like gagging dont continue to gag untill u throw up.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	the only time I got it was right after I brushed my teeth in the morning, and I couldn't find any way to avoid it. A lot of people eat Saltine's to help along with Sprite. Try that. Next time you go to your doctor, ask about Premesis though. It's a prescription prenatal vitamin that's blue and oval shaped I got my 13th week and as soon as I started it, my nausea went away and I felt SO much better it's indescribable.|`|5cBbi5pJaa	girl i totally feel you. my doctor recommended me to go to the my local pharmacy and ask for lollipops or candies that ease morning sickness. it comes in grat flavors too. <br>  <br>  or....sucking on a wedge of lemon or squeezing it into your water.<br>  <br>  always helps. good luck. by no time you'll be feeling like yourself again.|`|TJewjzi9aa	Nothing worked for me. I ended up quitting my job and at 20 weeks found out it was a multiple birth. (twins)<br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Sour candy or Preggie Pops worked for me. Also, I couldn't allow myself to get hungy- that's when it was the worst for me.<br>  <br>  Since you're almost at 12 weeks, you might get some relief soon anyway- my nausea let up around 13 weeks or so.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I ate dry trix cereal idk why it helped me. <br>  Try crackers.
28WJwHf4aa	If you would be 5 weeks tomorrow, then a home pregnancy test should show a positive.... however, you may want to go to the doctor and have a blood test done. Although rare, some women don't get positive test results on HPT for a couple of months.|`|96HWpdkFaa	Go to the doctor and get a blood test.<br>  <br>  IF you are pregnant...you will know it's morning sickness when you feel nauses or throw up.|`|AA11763588	Typically morning sickness starts at week 6.<br>  <br>  For me, both times, it felt like I was on a never ending boat ride, rocking back and forth for 12 long weeks. When I looked at food, saw food, ate food, or heard about food on TV I ran to the bathroom to throw up.|`|HOdblqIkaa	youll know when it hits but for me it started off as gagging when brushing my teeth, then i couldnt stand certain smells or foods (all cheese made me sick for about 3 months), throwing up after you eat. its kinda like the flu but without the other symptoms. if you think you might be preg but the test came back negative then go to the dr for a blood test theyll be able to tell you then but it could just be your period coming.|`|0RFUKkBLaa	Chances are your not pregnant if your suppose to be 5 weeks and the test came up negative. it would of picked up the pregnancy hormone by now|`|Tn0EBBCZaa	call the doct.. and book an appointment|`|tcHkn0VIaa	morning sickness doesn't just happen in the morning that is for sure! and your due date is calculated 40 weeks after the first day of your last period. so you can count the weeks from that time and find out how pregnant you are if in fact you are pregnant. I would say take another home pregnancy test and if that is negative and you still feel like you are pregnant I would go to your Dr. and have a blood test because some HPT's are not sensitive enough for some women's hormone levels in early pregnancy.|`|MsipL0Mzaa	you could be....when i had morning sickness i gagged everytime i brushed my teeth....it will usually be evryday..smells make you nauseous..you quit liking certain foods...tired...morning sickness usually starts between 6-8 weeks.|`|D35xKICoaa	Do a blood test at your doc you are pregnant.best of luck*******.|`|uqjEXAOmaa	you get sick in the morning...
D35xKICoaa	happen already what can you do but have the baby.And next time leave sex alone until you finish your schooling. just tell them that you made a big mistake and only hope they can forgive you and you will not let it happen again if they cuss just be humble good luck******|`|BzCYQlcuaa	first you have to relax, tell someone you trust.. AN ADULT. don't tell your best Friend and have them tell the entire school. you need to go to a adult. your mom, dad , aunt or even school teacher. you will get threw this. your brave for even looking for advice. just remember you can get threw this. don't wait to long.... and if your mom gets mad at first .. she will always love you and she will get over it! so take  (maybe) yelling at first and then she will be fine!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Sex is for adults.  Adults are mature and can handle interaction with their parents.  What you did was an adult thing, and you should be able to handle it like an adult.  Telling your parents you're pregnant can't be any scarier than your first time...|`|HOdblqIkaa	the earlier you tell them the better. just blurt it out. theyll get mad but there isnt much they can do. eventually they will warm up to the fact that your having a baby and they will help you out which trust me you will need. but try not to stress its bad for the baby|`|eS4CSdQ5aa	just tell them...you werent scared to make a grown up decision to have sex<br>  <br>  so make a grown up, mature decision to tell your parents<br>  <br>  having sex at 14 is absolutely incredible. you are a child.|`|c3WJMgA1aa	Why are you having sex at 14 anyways? I think you need to be much smarter than that!<br>  <br>  Just be upfront with your parents. Theres not much else you can do.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Your gonna need it!|`|05aff513ad329a92864aefaa6b5daa9faa	14 and pregnant?  Thats crazy.  Stupid kids and stupid parents!!!|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Very hard thing to deal with on your own so the sooner you tell your parents the better ! they are prob not going to be very happy but will learn to deal ,You can sit down and have a talk about your options and what your going to do ,You need to grow up and be an adult im not being judge mental but if you can have sex at 14 and get pregnant you can tell your parents you are pregnant ,I was 16 when i got pregnant and 17 when i had my son so i know how hard it can be ,your just going to have to get them when they are alone and just say it be better off for you and the baby ! Are you going to keep it ? I wish you well hun hope everything turns out alright :) If you need wanna talk so more just email me im not going to judge everyone makes mistakes we learn for them :)|`|E2UXN7J1aa	You just tell them "Mom...dad...I'm pregnant." If you were old enough to have sex you are old enough to tell them that you are now pregnant so please don't put it off. <br>  <br>  As for what to do I suggest you start reading online about your options. You need to decide if you want to raise the baby, give the baby up for adoption, or get an abortion which I personally am against and do not advise. It's going to be really tough raising a child while you are so young, but people have done it before and will continue to do it. I hope you have a lot of support. You are going to need it. Good luck.|`|KA5nhL1uaa	sit them down and explain to them that you've made a mistake and you'd like to explore your options before you make a decision as to keeping it or not. be mature and talk to them like you're an adult. they'll probably be pretty upset with you, so just take it in and handle it maturely.|`|zk3Bp9uNaa	Be honest and just tell them - and don't leave it too long.<br>  <br>  Step up to your responsibilities, you made the choice to have sex, so you have to deal with the consequences|`|yQVcIfa8aa	Don't delay, just tell them immediately and be honest, tell them that you have made a mistake and you need their help and support, good luck.|`|zDNnon1Jaa	i would tell them that what you have done is a very foolish thing and that you understand the consequences of it|`|70kh6VSoaa	you do the only thing you can do sit down with them and tell them good luck you have a long road ahead of you hun|`|SW7EfdCGaa	I was pregnant at 14 now 20 with a 5 year old girl and a 11 month old boy wouldn't change it for the world, nothing can ever compare to the special moments you share will your child, the first time you see them, the word "MUM" and holding them while they sleep soundly. But there were many a times I thought I wouldn't make it, between the birth, a relationship breakdown (daughters father), lawyers and courts trying to finish high school, sleepless nights, go to uni, have a job and a place . You need support no question about it from your parents (which I didn't have) and the father (I was blessed with my sons father) And still it's a hard road, you don't realise it but you are still so young and with a child in the picture you either have to grow up really fast or the child will suffer. Think carefully about your decision it changes more than just your life.<br>  <br>  Telling your parents will be difficult you will scared, there will be tears, and they will be angry. But after everything is said and done and a little time has passed a good parent will work though this with you, and although your life feels like it's ending you will get though this.<br>  <br>  PS Some hints: Don't tell any of your friends, not even your best friend, rumours will get out. <br>  Termination can only happen to a fetus less than 12 weeks so choices will have to made fast unfortunately<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and if you have any other question please ask.|`|Guj2d3Xmaa	Just tell them. The quicker you tell them the better trust me. I'm 17 and I'm pregnant and I was so afraid to tell my parents but it's not as hard as you think it is really. Just remember that they are your parents and that they are going to love you no matter what. SO even though they will be really mad at you for a while, and they may not even speak to you for a while, they will always love you and they will come around. Once you tell them it will feel so much better, it will be like a huge weight off your shoulders.Just assure them that your not proud of what happened and that your sorry but that you will stay in school and you will make responsible decisions.<br>  You should also start thinking about your options on whether you want to keep the baby or not. That way when you tell them you have a plan. You have a long 9 months ahead of you and it can be really scary, I'm still scared for a number of reasons but at least you know that if you tell your parents , especially mom, you will have there support. I mean they love you otherwise they wouldnt be angry with you when you tell them. Just relax and sit them down and tell them or, if your really that scared ask to spend the night at a friends house and make a phone call and tell them that way, its not the best way but if your afraid to tell them face to face then do that or just have someone come with you for comfort and support.<br>              sorry i wrote so much, if you need to talk to someone you can email me at anytime jaslene09@yahoo.com|`|HUsv9VU9aa	I was 16 when i got pregnant. I was going to tell my mom and dad with my boyfriend, but he left to Miami to tell his parents. So i ended up telling my parents while he was gone. If your parents are like mine. Don't be scared they won't be mad at first...they will be sad. Both of my parents cried and locked themselves in their bedroom. My dad didn't speak to me and my mom was depressed. THEN my MOM because my best friend and my dad was the #1 grandpa in the world.  THIS is when you STAY IN SCHOOL and make it up to them because they will be the ones helping you with this baby until you move out!|`|5cBbi5pJaa	Sweetie you're fourteen...you're way to young to be even having sex. On top of that you yourself are still a baby. I know it seems scary to talk to your parents but in the end remember...they are all you've got. When I was 16 and started having sex I didn't want to talk to my parents but I ended up talking to my mom. So if anything talk to your mom. Don't hide this because in no time it'll be too late for any other options.|`|b7a7b6437a7b32c214a558f73ed27e54aa	I was 16 when I got pregnant with my daughter! I know its hard but you have to tell your parents, I was scared to death. As uncomfortable as it is, your parents love you No matter what. Just sit them down and tell them that you made a mistake, and you need their help and love.  I am 24 now and my daughter just turned 7. You can make it through this just stay strong!! :) I hope everything works out.|`|UA9fu8khaa	Do you have an older sister or friend you can enlist to go with you for moral support? I won't lecture because there's no point, the important thing now is to tell them as soon as possible. You will need their help. They will be angry and disappointed at first but it is only because they love you and wanted the best for you.|`|XRSYQXctaa	You're fourteen and pregnant? Well the first thing I'm gonna tell you is that you should have used protection okay? You NEED to tell your parents. Don't even think about not telling them.. you're going to need all the help you can get and you shoul dhave given us a little more information about how your parents are..|`|h1AIzD9baa	i am 22 and pregnant and didn't want to tell my parents.. but i was on birth control and not trying to concieve..  i have an older sister she is 26.. i told her first and she went with me to my mom and dads and was there for me while i told them.. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i know you are alot younger.. but i think it helps to have some one you love and trust with you for support..|`|ppVT5QC7aa	You should have thought about that before you did the dirty. You are not mature enough for that yet. Or responsible enough. Just sit them down and tell them. The sooner the better. You are still a child yourself. Have you told the father -to -be yet? Better let him know too. The sooner you get to see a doctor the better.|`|XukXVsJvaa	I agree with baby mama. Why are you having sex anyways?

R36nThwLaa	its probably not a yeast infection ignore who said that!<br>  i know you really want answers. i have done a lot of research online and in books, some women do report having yellow cm either thick, watery, stringy.....it all depends on the persons body. everybody is different. do you have any other symptoms? you could very well be preggo. Baby dust to us both and hopefully its our *month*|`|MTY1soXWaa	it could be yeast infection|`|txSiQc7Waa	Well some of it could be sperm but I've heard of women say that their cm changed to a thicker/yellowish.... so it could very well be a sign of pregnancy...

4hzUOmEOaa	rice cereal is okay to give your baby at two months my son is four months and his doctor pu him on  it at two weeks to hold his food down.. his doctor is head of childrens hospital here in columbus so Im sure he knows what he is talking about. your daughter is okay to have it.... Tiffany|`|g9vw4ovGaa	OH good lord!! All these baby book thumpers and listening to their doctors like it's scripture. *pulls hair out* I started my daughter on rice cereal at 3 months, with a spoon and breast milk, she is healthy as an ox, she's never even had an ear infection. She acted like she was ALWAYS hungry, so my mom said, try cereal, and she loved it and could go more than an hour without feeding.|`|70kh6VSoaa	2 months and pretty thick she was little the doc said it would help her put on weight and shes is fine|`|xuiSfzgraa	1 month..Gave it to my daughter every evening...Never had a problem, and it helped her sleep through the night..|`|n6XYYyoLaa	a little early, but she had reflux really bad, so i don't think that would count...they generally recommend four mos at the earliest barring reflux...ask your doc if you think u should start now....|`|aJLx0nhNaa	5.5 months.  We did the cereal thing for about a week.  More for me than for him, I think, I was terrified he'd choke.|`|1VOsRV8Maa	I think 4 months. But my baby didn't really need it until then. He was a little boy and didn't have any MAJOR growth spurts until recently. He's 8 months old now, and I give him cereal twice or 3 times a day. My friend had a baby who weighed 8 and a half lbs at birth, and she had to start him on cereal around 3 weeks! He's 5 months old now and weighs 23 lbs! He's a HUGE kid! I think it just depends on how fast your little one is growing! If she'll eat it, I think it's ok to give it to her. You're the mama, you know best. :)|`|DDIBEvUTaa	just before 5 months.  only because his doc recommended it because his growth had slowed.  It increased his appetite dramatically.|`|SjX72fPyaa	Shortly after 4 months|`|rAkWoweOaa	3 months|`|KyhnSRrJaa	2 months is waaaaay to early to start cereal for many reasons (food allergies, obesity, choking risks, etc.)<br>  <br>  Start cereal after the baby has been sleeping through the night, but then starts waking up in the night again because he/she is hungry. As long as baby is full from breast milk or formula, there's no need to feed cereal. <br>  <br>  There's no certain month or time to start, it's different for every baby, but souldn't be before 4-6 months.<br>  <br>  Actually, cereal is not nutritionally necessary. Breastmilk provides all the nutrition a baby needs. Cereal is more to teach a baby how to eat, get used to textures, etc. Some people skip cereal all together.<br>  <br>  Wait until at least 4 months, but the longer you wait the better.  Most pediatricians and experts recommend 6 months.|`|BmwD4baxaa	My baby is 4 months and I'm planning on starting him this week and then a month later we will start solids.  I think it just depends on the child, doctors are now saying wait till 6 months but depending on the times its always something different.  I know moms that have given babies at 2 weeks rice cereal to help them sleep.  Doctors are now saying that they cannot digest food into their tiny systems until 6 months, or till they can sit up on their own.  I think this is a bunch of oopla.  Hope this helps|`|8yTP3jO8aa	About 6 months, tried it once, and realized it wasn't much more than fortified wall paper paste, then gave finger foods instead.<br>  <br>  2 and a half months?  I know we want babies to reach new milestones and grow up, but solid foods isn't one that babies benefit when rushed, regardless of enjoyment.|`|avx7bLnKaa	they say not to give solids until 4-6 months because the digestive tract of infants is still maturing and you don't want to injure it and/or by introducing solids too early you can possibly cause your child to have more food allergies|`|SaRDq9iLaa	About 4 months.  Don't listen to anyone else, you know what's best for your child!  Good luck!  :-)|`|8WOzftFuaa	6 months|`|sagjCRvKaa	Around 4 months|`|DNygQdmVaa	my pediatrician said to never give solids at all until 4 months, but i waited until 6 months.

02d8b50a9d75922bc496ff2a4c76185baa	At this age, kids are trying to try out their independence.  They want to do things themselves but then realize that they have a lot of limitations and this gets them frustrated.  That's why the "I need you but I dont need you attitude".  Having a toddler myself I find that when this battle starts, the best thing is to remain calm and dont let her see that she is frustrating me.  I calmly walk up to her and in a soft voice tell her..."I can't help you if you behave like this but when you are ready to be nice and if you want my help, I will be in the other room" and I just walk away.  The power struggle is what they want, you don't give in to her and eventually she will come and find you.  Make it clear that you are simply not going to play her game.  If she pees on the floor, tell her you are going to put her in diapers like a baby if she does it again, then follow through with your promise if needed.  The most important thing is consistency.  It will be draining for a couple of days but if you stay on her she will come around.  Hope this helps.|`|K25chqlmaa	its called terrible two's!<br>  she will get better!! <br>  you probably should wait to potty train till shes late 3 almost 4.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	teach her the concept of sharing... they are naturally egocentric and don't wanna share at this age... lead by example, show her how it is automatic and comfortable it is for you to share.   <br>  <br>  ask her with finality whether it is a yes or a no... help her by illustrating to her clearly the consequences of a yes and of a no... say for example when you have to share food, if you want this then you may share it with me if not I shall finish it all up by myself...train her to have clear cut decisions and build up her decision making skills -- start with mundane things like choosing a pair of pink or yellow socks... progress from there.  also when we ask children we should ask in a non-threatening tone.  her indecision may be caused by fear of giving the wrong answer -- even in reality there isn't really a right or wrong answer.   <br>  <br>  it's ok for kids to commit mistakes... we aren't perfect  robots :o) we are human and we learn through mistakes... she's starting to learn and may urinate on the floor during potty training.  don't chastise the child or punish her when they commit mistakes or when they spill food or drink on the table or the floor... or they will be afraid to try at all... the exact opposite of that -- encouragement and assurance -- will hone her self-esteem and she will be able to decide on her own in the long haul.|`|ZrJX66jEaa	its called terrible 2's.<br>  i would slap the **** out of her if she pee on my floors!|`|apJeVkfHaa	Be patient and wait until she is 4 :) At 3 she will probably get worse. 2's and 3's are pretty bad but be patient. Talk calm, explain things the best you can.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend against using her room as a timeout. The rule of thumb is 1 minute for every year of age they are in a corner. 2 minutes in a corner is hell for a 2 year old. Accordingly, 3 minutes for a 3 year old.<br>  <br>  When she is misbehaving stop whatever is happening and pick her up, put her in the corner and sit there for 2 minutes. This will break the tension of whatever was upsetting her. While in the corner, no talking, no playing, nothing. It is timeout, not negotiation time. <br>  <br>  Again I personally discourage using her room as timeout. That is a place to sleep, play and feel at peace. The corner is much more effective.|`|9tvYuVzuaa	I would put my foot down. Ask once if she changes her mind then you make the choice for her and make her do, what you decided. To stay in time out don't give in, keep putting her back in. When quiet start 2 min time out.|`|Y2VsqIO7aa	It's normal for toddlers to be like this. They want to gain a bit of independence and to be able to decide for themselves. It will ease out when she's 4 or 5 years old. Don't worry.What you could do is to be more patient and to guide her. Compromise. For example, let her choose the clothes she wants to wear and help her dress up. Give her options about meals -- what foods you're planning to prepare, and let her choose which ones she'd like to eat.Potty training could really be a challenge for you and for her. Compared to us, toddlers are unable to "hold on" to their urine or poop long enough. What you could do (suggestion) is to buy a portable toilet bowl (you could buy this at the mall. it's made of hard plastic and has a soft synthetic leather cushion. my younger sister had one.) and train her to use it. They're a lot easier to get into than climbing a tall toilet bowl. When she has already mastered using the portable bowl when she needs to pee or poop, you could gradually train her to use the "real" toilet bowl afterward.|`|m3cf7vsAaa	kids throw fits, however potty training is a separate thing.  I wouldn't group them together as it may make child rearing seem even more overwhelming.  I also have a 2 year old who loves to test me.  Do you still have her crib?  My daughter's crib turns to a little day bed, but when she is acting up I tell her she is going to sit in her crib... and I put the side back up.  She usually cries for 5-10minutes before I go in and ask her if she is ready to come out and behave.  You have to find an effective way of disciplining her now because it will only get worse.  Take control, you are the parent.  Maybe google some information on two year olds, toilet training, and fits, also on sharing and how they perceive the world around them.  As far as pee on your floor goes, Is it really going to matter in ten years how many spots she made on the carpet?  Buy carpet spray (like the kind for pets) and put your chin up.  You are just at that point with her, she's two.  It gets frustrating, but the more you understand her the better off you will be.

OHq5gSjJaa	I have an 8 month old and I am right there with you...  I don't think there is much we can do other than wait patiently.  <br>  <br>  One thing is to make sure that he is eating because he truly is hungry and not just out of habit and needing to suck/comfort eat to fall back asleep when he wakes up.  So when he wakes up first try to pick him up and sway with him or rock him for about 10 minutes or so.  If he starts to fall back asleep he probably isn't really hungry.  If he is fussing louder and crying than he probably just really needs to eat.  <br>  <br>  Hang in there!|`|fHjSonssaa	While it may not be common, it is not abnormal for a baby to get up in the middle of the night until they are 1.<br>  <br>  My son is 11 months old. <br>  He used to sleep ALL  the way through the night without waking- but he started waking up again at about 7 months or so, and now he's up most nights- but not all of them 1 time to feed.  The only way he usually doesn't get up in the middle of the night is if I wake him for a bottle at 11pm or so before I go to sleep- which I don't usually do, but have done before.<br>  <br>  Patience is best- maybe instead of water you could give him formula or breasmilk?<br>  <br>  Eating every 4 hours is very normal.<br>  He's only 7 months, give the kid a break.|`|D8sMuoCpaa	You have a 7 month old. They tend not to sleep through the night.|`|0btrijJCaa	See a Doctor?<br>  <br>  Good luck with you and your baby !! :D|`|AA10623103	Sometimes when babies start to wake durning the night, (they all do, sleep comes in stages) they will settle themselves back down and go back to sleep, unless of course if Mom or Pop runs in and picks them up, and takes them off for a feeding. Perhaps, you haven't given your son the chance to learn how to settle himself yet.  My daughter used to find her binki and put herself back down to sleep. My oldest daughter used to rub a soft blanket against her cheek to get back to sleep. Maybe he just needs a little extra time.|`|9tvYuVzuaa	Your son is young - I would not hope for a full night of sleep until he turns 1 1\2 - 2 years old.<br>  <br>  My 8 month old is on the same schedule, eats at 8 then goes to bed and wakes to eat about 12 and about 4 and is up at 8 to eat again and so on.<br>   <br>  I have 3 children. 5, 4, and 8 months. With my 5 and 4 year old they  did not sleep through the night until, I guess it was about 1 1\2 - 2 years old. I spoke to there doctor, she said to cut out all night feedings. She had no concern with doing so. (no weight or growing problems) YES, it was very hard but it worked. The only time I could not break was 4:00 for a drink. (BUT my fault, I even get thirsty at night) There doctor said it is a habit. <br>  <br>                                      GOOD LUCK|`|g9vw4ovGaa	My daughter didn't sleep through the night til she was a year old, no matter what I did, she refused to sleep through the night.

uGqYoZNEaa	Well I"m glad to know I"m not the only one who feels like that!  I have a 6 yo boy and 14 month old girl, and it was the same with both.  I breastfed son until he was 2 and noticed that after that the feelings started going away.  They completely went away as I enjoyed a little more freedom away from baby and he gained his independence.  With daughter the feelings still linger, maybe cos I am still breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  But also when I see new moms with their babies I get the feeling of, "Their pregnancy/new mom is perfect."  This happened even when my baby was only a few months old!  For me it was that I fantasized about what the perfect preg/infant stage was, and that everyone else had it except me.<br>  <br>  So hope these feelings fade.  {Hugs}|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I think this is a very normal feeling. I , however, have been pregnant for so long I think I have forgotten what its like not to be!!!!!<br>  I have a 15 month old, a 4 month old, and I am 11 weeks pregnant again.......All I want to do is wear normal clothes for once!!!! But this will be my 7th and LAST child, I am sure I will be crying my eyes out when I finally face the fact that I will not be doing this anymore!|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	I imiss it soooooooo much, i had a great pregnancy until the last 2 weeks.

I miss being pregnant with my daughter and feeling her move in side of me!

KQF5X9Vpaa	Your not dilating more because its not time for you to have the baby...once its time you will finish dilating...some women start dilating earlier than others|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	You'll just need to hang in there until you go into labor.  Many women walk around 2-3cm dilated for weeks!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Im no expert, but have you tried walking? I know 37 weeks is full term, so why not? It's safe and if anything it just makes you more fit for labor!|`|3EiOobEVaa	If you can't convince your husband to have sex...I<br>   would do some walking...I have also heard that some people take castor oil but it will make your bowels loose if the baby isn't ready to  come out..the castor oil thing is just something I read on the internet|`|w1drJWKAaa	Walk. Walk as much as you can as often as you can. It helps. <br>  <br>  Plus it helps for when you're having the baby.

E2UXN7J1aa	That isn't sexual assault to me. I personally don't think it is right when people pull their child's pants down to spank them, but even that is better than hitting them across the face. I experienced both of those growing up and let me tell you...spanking is much better. I think spanking should only be used in serious situations though. If they child is putting themselves in danger and no other form of punishment is working then spanking is ok. Some people start to rely on it too much though.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	Getting swat on the butt is not sexual child...it is the safest place to hit a child because the butt is well cushioned and unless you are trying to hurt the kid will not leave a permanent or temporary mark. if you hit a child in the face you could cause him to have severe neck trauma like whiplash. and a child's hands are very sensitive...if you hit them you could break the sensitive veins in their hands and cause them more pain and suffering.|`|AA12066269	I was taught that the shape of the hand was well designed to fit the curve of the butt and that an open hand is the only implement that should be used to smack a child with and only on the butt.  Your hand will start hurting before any physical damage can be done to a child's bottom.|`|nqcnylFpaa	spanking a child is not sexual assault i know because i am a cop i have these things but if anybody slap a child then i am going to punch slapper in their face i have then it before but if a belt is used on the child then i will break their arm the belt is used to hold up pants not to hit somebody|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	There is no great rational explanation for the preference for disciplining children by spanking them on the bottom, except perhaps that that part of the body is relatively well padded and less sensitive than the face. Much of it is tradition and symbolism. Spanking on the bottom is parental discipline because it has always been that way; hitting in the face is abuse because it doesn't fit in the time-honored tradition of parental spanking. Oh, and honestly if I had a choice I would not prefer to be slapped in the face!|`|tjLbXhtEaa	Because there is extra padding on the butt to absorb some of the shock. I am not sure about you issue with the butt being a sexual thing considering normally the clothes are on??<br>  <br>  A slap to the facee for a child could rattle their brains and affect them mentally for the rest of their lives, that is why it isn't legal.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	They are both abusive.|`|lzivF4Idaa	cuz thats generally the meatiest area and you cant really damage anything there unless you go super hard with it.
KQF5X9Vpaa	If you think you're having contractions then time them..my dr told me to wait until i was about 5 minutes apart before going to the hospital..depending on how far away you are from the hospital make your best judgement from there|`|3kW6i3Vdaa	I think you should go to the hospital about..hmm...10minutes ago?!|`|1jWNcJDVaa	Go to the hospital right now!!<br>  congrats and good luck!!!|`|g5JeSJbNaa	you need to call the hospital and let them know what is happening, depending on how far you live from the hospital depends on when the best time to go to the hospital is . normally when contractions are 5 to 10 minutes apart ring the hospital and they will advice you better . good luck  and congrads
kRaVa0Wraa	it means dont take it on an empty stomach.<br>  most pills say that. it helps the pill work better/absorb into the body better if you have food in your stomach.|`|GHnkKwl3aa	I take it with Applesauce :-)<br>  <br>  It's a huge asss pill!|`|AA12185784	You eat a little food,then take it,otherwise you'll get a stomach ache.<br>  I take this! I really like it,not that I have really bad acne but it helps keep my skin clear.|`|mfBkH3qtaa	It means do not take it on an empty stomach. It can make ur stomach upset. And pills work better when you have food in your stomache|`|drI1vsJdaa	You take it after you've had at least a few bites of food, or else you'll get a stomach ache.
QpSbFVYbaa	I think it depends on severity. my son has very mild autism. He is very affectionate, sweet and loving. He does have a hard time making eye contact if he thinks he is in trouble. He has some repetitious behavior. His main "symptom" is lack of social skills and understanding. He is also very easily distracted by buzzing lights, squeaking shoes, etc. He also has a difficult time with abstract ideas such as "before, under, over, around,...". He does understand concrete math ideas better (as long as they aren't word problems).<br>  <br>  If you think you or a loved one has this, you can go to the schools first (if they are in school still). They can test this person for Aspergers, Autism, Autism Spectrum Disorder or PDD. The earlier you test, the earlier you get treatment. Depending on severity you or your loved one may experience this totally different than another person. Please go to your doctor to confirm diagnosis and see a specialist.
wqRSMSlLaa	Dizziness often accompanies postpartum anxiety, but I cannot assess you here, of course.  Tell your MD about the dizziness, since it may be due from other causes such as low iron, lack of sleep, and so on.  Postpartum depression does not necessarily go away on its own.  I suggest you also speak with a therapist who specializes in postpartum depression.  She should be able to tell you whether or not you are suffering from the disorder and if so, what to do in order to recover.<br>  <br>  Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|SsfnitjXaa	Never had that.  My child was born with cerebral palsy so I was too busy worrying about him.  Never had dizzy spells either.|`|QTSsGbubaa	go to ur obgyn... it can last up to 18 month non treated|`|g9vw4ovGaa	I had a few dizzy spells every now and again, I think it was due to the epidural. My husband deployed a week after our daughter was born so I'm not sure what truly caused my postpartum, but I know it was hell on earth. I went to the doctor the second I knew it was a problem and got on some medication, after a few months I started feeling better than ever. Now that he's home and safe, I no longer need the medication. Every woman is different and it is completly normal to have it, so don't feel like you're bad mother! Your a great mom i'm sure, just do what you feel is best for you and your body|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	first, you have to go to your gynec and tell about it.. i did.. and it turned out to be nothing - just too many things happening in my life at that time.. i felt a huge relief knowing that it was a false alarm.. so go and talk to him about ppd - and once you get a clean bill of health, know that you need some support and encouragement and not the pills :)
ZcrqGl5Naa	Joe Evan<br>  it is cute n a boys name|`|nHhQ952Kaa	Jo sounds feminine,  but JoEvan works|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	I ? Joévan.<br>  Congrats<br>  - & -<br>  Best wishes!|`|zHmZkMStaa	Jo is feminine for Josephine :(<br>  Please consider JoeEvan, or Joe Evan, or Joe-Evan?<br>  <br>  As is; people will ask him a million times how to spell his name.  If you name him JoEvan, they'll misspell or mispronounce it nearly a billion times over his lifetime?  Common spellings are best and easiest. In short?  Please consider sparing your son the hassle of spelling his name aloud on a daily basis.  He'll thank you.|`|4SKIE1C8aa	Joévin looks French and as such would be pronounced jo-ay-vihn. Same deal for Joévan but it woul be jo-ay-vahn. The accent aigu draws the 'e' into an 'ay' sound.<br>  <br>  JoEvan reminds me of JonBenét.<br>  <br>  Traditionally Jo is the feminine form of Joe so I suggest sticking with the spelling Joe and naming hime Joe Evan Troy (or maybe Joseph Evan Troy?) Or drop either Evan or Troy since the third name is a mouthful and doesn't flow.|`|85gJHDbNaa	I think you son will ask to be emancipated because you named him Jo Evan. It's a fine nick name for Joseph Evan, but I would hate to have the name Joevan. If you name him Joseph evan, he can actually have more of a say in what he wants to be called, since possibilities are endless. If only people could name themselves......|`|l9auUv2laa	I like Jo Evin the best(;|`|57LFRfqCaa	Either Evan Joseph or Joseph Evan.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Please...Joe Evan or better yet, Joseph Evan.

A very unique name, I like it. =]|`|hmOidFp3aa	JoEvan...for sure! Cute name by the way!|`|dJx5eKx3aa	I think being unique and making your own spelling would be nice. It would set him apart and insure that no one ever pronounces his name wrong. What if you spelled it: Joehvin? might be a little too weird but something like that. maybe without the h, as people might pronounce it instead of making it silent. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck|`|aaSlF0gnaa	Don't name your child that he will grow up and hate you for it cause it is pretty weird.|`|vVIWO79paa	i like JoEvin better
ibWLdXlJaa	Brown is supposed to be the stronger gene.My husband has brown and all his family(they are mexican). My son was born with black eyes. They have since changed to blue exactly like mine. I'm pretty sure they won't change. I would be bummed if they do. They are blue but rimmed with white around the pupil. They will start out blue then turn brown would be my guess.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	No.<br>  <br>  Look, I have an 8 month old baby.  I can't even tell what color his eyes are going to be now.

KQF5X9Vpaa	my mom had 6 children...first 3 were late...last 3 were early...i'd say with your progression that this one will probably be a couple days early..but thats just my guess|`|df378c28318ff6097f7f272b0367e6cbaa	Most likely you will have the baby on or after your due date, not before.  My first was 2 1/2 weeks early, my second was nearly 4 weeks early.  I am now 32 weeks pregnant and hope this one comes early too!!!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	All that I have read indicates early but not by too much maybe a week or so. Good luck!!!
KICQQxLxaa	is he the father of the child?  If he is the father, he has legal rights to the child, which he would have to go to court for.<br>  <br>  If he is not the father, he has no legal rights.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	what ever u guys agree on or what the courts tell u to do|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	If you two can't agree between something you'll have to go to court to decide that. A judge will help you figure out who gets custody and how much among other things.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming he's the father. If not, then he technically has no rights. If he has helped out with the baby and is attached to him/her, I hope you would allow him to be part of his/her life rather than cutting him out.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	did he (and you) sign a form at the hospital, stating that he was the father? we did, and it means he has parental rights, and also that you can get child support.<br>  <br>  if not, he'll have to pay for testing and lawyers to get rights (if you choose to fight him on it),|`|u94HOVz7aa	depends on if he is already on the birth cert. already or not.  if not he has none until he petitions the court for them. If he is then he has as much rights as you.  You'd have to get a parenting plan filed with the court right away or he can come take the baby and you couldnt stop him.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	It depends upon if he is the father or not..............|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I am assuming that he is the father of the child. He has NO rights at all until he goes to court and files for legitimization. Once he does that then he would have to also file for visitation rights and you would have to file for child support. You can always try to work something out on your own, but unless it is signed by a judge it is useless if one of you decided to deviate from it.|`|JXmvNMRwaa	Your child's rights do not change based on whether or not you are with the father.  Make sure that you have the father's social security number so that you can arrange for the government to hunt him down for child support.  Your child has the right to be supported by his father regardless of how he feels about you.|`|2e36923da51c815eb4096942999c182baa	YOUR 3 month old Child<br>  <br>  What about Both of yours child?<br>  <br>  Let me tell you, I'm the product of a divorced broken up couple, and it took me until I was 22 years old to figure out what I had to do,<br>  I went to court and legally disowned BOTH OF THEM!<br>  I've changed my name and gotten on with my life NO thanks to the perpetrators of CRIMINAL emotional abuse!<br>  <br>  Do you want to abuse your child?<br>  Make some agreements (out-of-court) with the Father of "your" child and be willing to give a bit FOR YOUR CHILD!<br>  Compromise, work together and let your kid know that the two of you are NOT at war!<br>  This is very important!  do you want your kid to simply survive, or thrive?   I do wish people would THINK before they spawn!|`|QTSsGbubaa	u have to take it to court.. if he is unfit her will jut have to pay child support... it goes by state and all.. search on google what it could be... he will at least get 2 weekends or weekdays a month unless he is unfit|`|AA10816009	If he is the father, and he goes to court, he will get visitation rights and you get child support. If not, he gets nothing.|`|z6OqBkBGaa	depends on if u go to court for custody or not.  other than that he has a right to see his child too. that is if its his?|`|eya1WDS4aa	If he is the father then yes. He has the same rights as you do.|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	he's the father, he has rights too.|`|KyhnSRrJaa	If he is the father of the baby, then he has the same rights you do.  If you guys can't work out some kind of arrangement for sharing custody on your own, then he would have to take you to court, and let the judge decide how to share custody of your child.<br>  <br>  Remember, though, if you guys break up, and especially if you are sharing custody, you are also entitled to child support.  Again, you'd have to go to court unless you work out something between yourselves.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, as long as he's not abusive or an unfit parent, he should have 50/50 custody of the child.  Every child needs a father.  BUT, if his being around the baby would be a bad influence, then I would do everything in my power to keep him away!  It all depends on the situation, but good luck!|`|docnk5mGaa	he has every right to his child as you do you didnt lay down and make that baby by yourself if he wants to be in his  childs life you need to let him be there has much as possible a baby is not leverage if he is gonna be responsible let him|`|jnBuYoiYaa	if hes the father he has every right to be in that child's life, and unless he is abusive/ bad influence  you should not keep him from his child.|`|efe0d3ff34905cd2401ab184bb90f5ecaa	If he is not the father he has no rights. The only was he could have gotten them is if he adopted your baby.|`|QsbYcxjiaa	if hes the father then he has the same rights u do and if not then he has no rights|`|OBPL49vWaa	You have full custody of your child until he goes to court.  even if he signed the birth certificate.

You know best whether telling them could result in physical harm to you.  If that is the case, my advice would be somewhat different.<br>  <br>  As a parent, my advice is to tell them, even if you are not sure yet.  There is no way that my daughter could break that news to me in a way that would not create a lot of mixed feelings; feeling like I had failed her somehow; feelings of relief that she told me; wishing that I could have protected her from the challenges ahead; honored that she trusted me enough to let me in on this part of her life; wanting to preserve her right to the activities of youth yet realizing that life is going to get a lot more challenging for her if a baby is involved.<br>  <br>  You may feel ready but at your age you are going to need a lot of support.  Most parents want to be there for their children.  It is a marvelous thing when our children do come to us for advice and support and allow us to provide it for them.<br>  <br>  Be prepared for an unfavorable response initially (just in case) but know that decisions don't get made in a matter of seconds or minutes.  Keep the line of communication open and continue to talk about the best way to handle the situation.  Obviously, the first step is going to be verifying that you are pregnant.  My Obstetrician (OB) told me that tests can give a false negative but she has never seen a false positive.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, be honest with your parents and keep your mind open to their advice.  They have already walked the road of parenthood and know the challenges that you will face.<br>  <br>  Good luck

If it lasts I would take her to the Dr. for some real meds - maybe panadol for the pain in the meantime.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	It could be the milk, but before worrying about that, I'd give her more fruit; applesauce, apricots...veggies and more grains. Perhaps the fiber will help her. Good luck|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Fruit juice<br>  Water<br>  Cereal|`|02d8b50a9d75922bc496ff2a4c76185baa	She is probably constipated.  Kids can get constipated even if they go to the bathroom regularly.  Is her poop really hard like little pebbles?  Those are painful to pass.  Definitely take her to the doctor.
nrqWwQBXaa	she knows who you are when i left my daughter for a night she did the same thing she knew who i was but she was mad that i left. after about an hour she came to me?|`|M6c0hUefaa	I'm going through something similar with my 11 month old. She's started staying with my mom more often during the week, while I'm working on things and my daughter has become really attached to my mother. <br>  <br>  I could be gone for hours and hours and come to pick her up and all she does is smile at me and carry on with whatever she's doing. While, my mother could walk into that very room having spent hours with her and my daughter will act like she hasn't seen her in days. I think she just got used to your mom, she isn't mad, she's just a baby and didn't understand what you were doing when you left her. Don't feel badly about it, a lot of times children will form attachments to other people than their parents, especially if it's someone who watches them frequently. Oh, and she remembers who you are, she's just being clingy to your mother.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	she is too young to leave that long|`|jLYTKr33aa	Who do you think is more fun - the mom who enforces all of the good - for - her rules, or the grandmother who surely spent the weekend spoiling her rotten?  Don't take it personally - your daughter both remembers and loves you.  It's likely that she was just really enjoying her own little vacation at Grandma's.|`|AA10943329	lol fear not, she remembers who you are. You are the one that says No! to her, teaches her right from wrong and raising her to be a good person. Grandma on the other hand is the one that spoils her, plays with her and does fun things....who would you rather be with lol. It is all very normal, she will be hanging off you again soon enough|`|01b990b6feebbb819d33fb976c859438aa	she remembered you, she just might have enjoyed being special with your mom. dont worry|`|XpoJkke6aa	If you just got back from vacation then don't worry, she will warm up to you eventually, so it is not so much that she doesn't remember you more that she is subconsciously mad at you for leaving her.... i know weird right? but it is true, when me and my family goes to Florida and leaves the cats locked in the house, when we come back they won't let us hold them for a while, they are just mad.<br>  <br>  However, if she doesn't recognize you or warms up to you in two weeks then you need to seek professional help. hope i helped.|`|82BSdiyCaa	My daughter used to do this with my husband when he would be on business trips and be gone for more than 2 days. They have always been the best of friends and she always runs to him when he gets home. It usually only lasted 24 hrs and then everything went back to normal. I think they feel a little abandoned, but trust me, she knows you love her!|`|OTFZtGCaaa	As everyone said, she remembers.  My little girl would not look at me for an hour after I had to leave her (not voluntarily!) for a night.  She did not laugh at any of the things that usually make her laugh and as I said, it took me an hour to ‘get her back’.  They do feel abandoned.<br>  <br>  One suggestion for next time you have to leave your child … leave something behind that has your scent (like a shirt or blanket) as it will remind her of you … and you’re still somewhat near.|`|PxC689lpaa	She is jsut probably used to your mother for the last two days that she hasnt quite figured that you are back again, she is only 14 months she probably loves anyone who will feed, put her to sleep and give her attention and your mother has been doing it for the past two days just give it time!|`|bEmsOf3Caa	Both my kids are VERY close to my mom. Since birth they have always chosen her over us. They scream bloody murder if they cant go with her! lol  Its just a grandma thing. Grandmas LOVE to spoil! I always had a close bond to my grandma. Dont worry about it, she still loves her mommy and daddy.   :o)|`|p2pE0Fpwaa	she is probably upset that you went away, but she must remember you.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	i dont think she forgot you shes more then likely p**** that you left her, or just really upset about it.|`|lPlOvSkTaa	she is probley mad at you for leaving her<br>  or <br>  she has a better connection to your mom...<br>  do my questions please
KA5nhL1uaa	it's very unlikely.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	All's I got to say about that is..."ew"|`|HOdblqIkaa	theres a chance but its really small. dont worry about it.|`|h3IjAuCgaa	Not likely because the fact is if the sperm is air born then it dies so chances are no ! But to be sure wash your hands !|`|OBn4a7rzaa	With a sock?! You could have at least lied to us, and said a tissue, or toilet paper.|`|DNygQdmVaa	i highly doubt it.|`|r35i6T54aa	dont listen to little mis xoxlovel because she is way wrong... sex is not the only way.. its possible but its a slim chance.. do you kno how many sperm come out every ejaculation... LOTS UPON LOTS AND LOTS TIMES 90 but its unlikely|`|5cBbi5pJaa	If it was completely wiped off I highly doubt it. <br>  Dude a sock...it was clean righhht?|`|MHeOHOnbaa	if you cleaned it off good then NO you don't have any worries|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Well yeah, DUH|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	no,|`|70kh6VSoaa	no stop doing any thing if u dont know that|`|OBPL49vWaa	chances are slim but there is always a chance
E2UXN7J1aa	It hurts quite a bit the first time, but it gets better after awhile. Everyone is different, but personally I only bleed a small small amount..like just a few drops. I hope if you are considering losing your virginity you know how to protect yourself from STDs and pregnancy. It can happen even with protection so please make sure you are mature enough to handle any of the consequences.|`|IA5zVfk0aa	well i lost it on my wedding night and i ended up crying because for me it hurt so bad.<br>  <br>  i only spotted, it was barely anything because i think i broke my hymen from gymnastics and tampons|`|CZg79Qy9aa	I lost mine at 17 and the guy was very gentle.  It hurt a little bit and I spotted a tiny bit.  Loosing your virginity is so over rated and no one tells you the emotional toll it takes on you.  You are forever connected to that person so make sure it is someone you don't want to forget in 5 yrs.....|`|Y8IgaNp5aa	i heard from friends that they cried because of the pain.
VZVGXRyraa	Your parents aren't the ones that press charges...if the someone finds out who doesn't agree with your relationship with him then all they have to do is go to the police and the state will investigate and press charges whether your parents agree with it or not.<br>  <br>  It's not illegal for you to date him, but it is illegal for you to have sexual relations with him until you're 18 or of the age of consent in your state. If you care for him at all, you'll be sure to keep things between the two of you clean.|`|r39EDGhPaa	No, that's illegal.  But if neither of your parents or friends say anything, you will be fine.  I think it's kind of weird that a senior in high school is sexually attracted to a freshman in high school, though.  He could be getting with hot, developed seniors..<br>  <br>  I know a guy who was 19 and slept with a 17 year old and now he's a "rapist" because she got mad at him and got him into trouble.  The AOC in my state is 18.  Messed up, right?|`|5jqfKDdfaa	No hes an adult and youre still a child....thats called statutory rape and he can to to jail even if you consented or your parents didnt press charges...its very illegal.<br>  <br>  Technically its illegal for you to be having sex at 15 anyway. The age of consent in most states is usually no less than 16 if you are with someone of consent age thats under 18.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	Well, its good she's getting you on the pill, and good that your not going to do that at 14. <br>  Right now, it is statutory rape (as said below). If you really dont want to get in trouble for it, I say wait until its legal, if not, I really wouldnt go around telling alot of people that you are, because he could get in alot of trouble for it.|`|TYxbaE4paa	Thats deff. illegal.<br>  and your parents don't care if you go and sleep with 18year olds? there's something wrong with that picture!|`|BUOJJpaCaa	It's technically illegal as the age of consent in most states is 16 years old. However, if your mom is ok with the fact that he is eighteen and isn't planning on pressing charges against him, you're in the clear.<br>  <br>  If you're even considering sex, get on the Pill or the Patch or some sort of birth control that you will remember to take so that you don't end up pregnant.<br>  <br>  I think it's a little creepy that you're so young and he's technically an adult but to each his own. When you're 21 and he's 25 it's not that big of a deal.|`|M7Ozqujtaa	Fifteen your still to young, and if you got pregnant (You can get pregnant on a pill and a condom) He could be charged with statutory rape, he could be charged with statutory rape even if you didn't get pregnant if someone found out.<br>  Thats illegal and you shouldn't do it, it will ruin his record and yours! <br>  Its gross weither your fourteen or fifteen your still to young to have sex and your mother should know that and she should be doing everything she can to get you to rethink this. Your ruining your life and his! Your virginity is precious its something your born with and its something you lose to your soulmate or to someone you TRULY love and at your age you haven't gotten around enough to truly know your in love with him or not he shouldn't even be thinking about having sex with you.<br>  <br>  My mom use to say the whole point is to not have sex before your married because once you have sex then the fun is over hes used you and he'll say "Ill stay with you no matter what" but he will just go get another play toy after awhile you will become useless to him!<br>  <br>  Do you really want that? <br>  <br>  Make a choice.<br>  <br>  Let him use you and ruin your life at such a young age.<br>  or <br>  Save yourself and give all your heart to your soulmate.|`|vAx9bLL1aa	if your going to be with him, then be with him.<br>  just dont do anything until at least seven months.<br>  then you know he just doesnt want it. he wants you.|`|WvBgXv5daa	Nope its not legal its Illegal!|`|Yqk8F2gUaa	Im sorry that's disgusting<br>  Hes 18!!!<br>  EWWWWW.<br>  He only wants sex|`|6PUCUH8Aaa	Yes its illegal. But if its consential then its consential. Prolly spelled that wrong. But here is my advice. I was 16 and my boyfriend was 19. I am now 20 years old and we were together until I was 19. Even though we had sex, I guess it could have been considered rape, but there was no reason for me to say anything bad on him we simply broke up and that was it. So if you decide to have sex, and then sometime down the road you break up. Be smart. If you break up just because your young and dont understand some of the "adult" things he is doing, dont make a stupid decision as to yelling rape. If your going to make an adult choice and have sex, then dont make a childish mistake and say he raped you when you break up.

DDYwnut6aa	Progesterone cream won't help a luteal phase defect, as there isn't enough to make a difference.   On top of that, manufacturers of synthetic progesterone alter the chemical makeup of progesterone in order to create progestins. Progestins in their altered molecular structure may cause many side effects, such as birth defects or abortion, fluid retention, epilepsy, migraine, asthma, cardiac or kidney dysfunction and depression. <br>  <br>   The poster above who mentioned speaking to your Dr. is correct.  You should let your Dr. know about the luteal phase defect - he/she can definitely help you.  The progesterone suppositories are not synthetic and can be an excellent fix.|`|KaNjj6HBaa	You are correct. Your luteal phase is to short. It would have to be any where from 10-17 days to get pregnant and sustain a pregnancy. You should look into using progesterone creme. It really helps even out your hormones. A lack in progesterone can cause your luteal phase to be to short.|`|2f6diQBiaa	Over the counter progesterone cream won't help. I know because I also have a luteal phase defect and tried it (they are WAY too weak). I would talk to your doctor. Show him/her your BBT/OPK charts. The best treatment is a combination of Clomid and Progesterone suppositories (I take 200mg suppositories 2 times a day- it only comes in a prescription). My luteal phases went from 7-9 days to 16-18 days.<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!

At this age, as long as you know his needs have been provided for (diaper, food, entertainment, etc) then it's ok to ignore it and let them whine.  It may get on your nerves, but eventually they'll get the idea that whining is not how they get mommy's attention.  I'm sorry to say, but this is a stage you'll have to get used to.  They seems to go through it every few months, sorry.  I know how badly it can grate on your nerves.|`|ntz2Z3Dpaa	Whining is the correct spelling.. And there is a reason that he is crying or whining.  He may be teething, give him a cold wash cloth to chew on.  He may need tummy time, he may be gassy, he may want a drink.  But I assure you there is a reason.  My baby will only fuss when it is nap time or bedtime.  They are just fighting going to sleep, but they will eventual quit.  Just make sure you try everything possible, it is funny the things you try and finally something will work, even a noise or a song, or a toy with lights and noise will quiet them.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	I got to go with CMU on this one.

More than one person, I'm sure.  Lives were changed, relationships tarnished, love questioned.  My first mother was young, between 14-16 from what I've heard.  Her father beat her and her mother (from what I've been told) to the point that they had to live in a shelter because of my conception.  If I could have a choice, at that moment, I would have never been conceived.  I would have rather never been, than be born from pain, into pain.  I would have rather been absent from this life than to cause others to have to suffer for someone they'd never get to know.  I have lived every day with the knowledge that I wasn't planned for.  I have knows since early childhood that I was a mistake.  You can call it a "surprise" or "unexpected" all you want.  I prefer to look at it without the rose colored glasses, but thank you.  I was a mistake.  I shouldn't have been.  I caused people pain before my birth, and every day after.  I am sure that my first mother still has pain in her heart and soul because of me.  Because of the situation.  <br>  My being born didn't do any good for anyone other than my a-parents who wanted a child quite badly.  I know that some people will argue that I was given a life I should be grateful for.  Had I not been born, I wouldn't know it.  No one would.  Grateful?  Not for a second.  I have lived every day as an adoptee, knowing that I was a disturbance (at best) to my first mother.  I was the much wanted child of a couple, who wanted a child so badly they waited nearly 10 years for me.  They are the ones who benefited from my birth.  I have not.  Had I been aborted, miscarried, or never conceived, I wouldn't know it.  My a-parents would have accepted another child, and my first mother would have carried on with her life, probably happier and healthier.<br>  <br>  I agree that birth control should be more readily available to prevent things like this from happening.  There is a certain amount of sheer torture that comes with knowing that you were never meant to be.  I live with this every day.|`|hTieELhTaa	I too am glad my bio mom didnt kill me. I was taken from her a 6 weeks and adopted by my first foster family when I was 2.  Sure my life has been confusing often hard at time dealing with the feelings of not being wanted wanting to know who my blood was. Wanting to know where i came from and why I couldnt be with the person who according to my adoptive parents loved me so much. sure I couldnt understand how you could love someone so much to just let them go. Sure my life has been an emotional rollercoaster but I would rather it be like that than be dead. I would rather live a confusing life then grow up living on the streets selling my self for food. I do belive I had a BETTER life. Sure my parents adopted because they wanted a little girl and kept having boys but if it werent for them I would have either bounced from foster home to foster home or possible raised in a group home. Adoption a very confusing subject to get into. Please just remember there is a big difference adopting from foster care where the kids truly need a home and someone to love and adopting from an agency that talks young women out of giving up there babies. VERY VERY big difference|`|CZg79Qy9aa	I am not pro choice...I don't believe in abortion, however, since I have had two children who are adopted to my older siblings.... I would have rather gotten an abortion.  <br>    No one tells you when you are young, the whole in your heart from adopting your kids out.  No one tells you that it hurts like hell to be so close to your kids and not be able to be their mom.<br>    I was fooled into giving my son to my older sister for her to adopt when I was 17.  I had a job, apartment, and everything was going ok.  My mother came to me and said if I don't let someone in the family adopt him, I "Will NEVER see him again and the state will take him away becaus I am so young."  I was so stupid to believe her.  <br>    Honestly, with the pain that came from the adoption and the pain I feel every single day (I'm now 21), it may have been easier to never have loved him...than to have loved him SO MUCH and have him ripped away...now he is dangled in front of my face and everytime I see him..I feel the what if I ...........  <br>    I also was adopted at 2.

Whether you are aborting or adopting or keeping that baby. YOU are making the decision for that baby all the way around. I find that hypocrisy.<br>    Second. You say that an adoption is more traumatic emotionally. When studies have proved that more people go into a deep depression after having an abortion rather than an adoption. Most women who have had placed children up for adoption have marked it as a good experience. I think you need to do more research on that area. <br>     Third. As far as women knowing if they can handle a pregnancy or not. I am a nurse. Your body would not let yourself get pregnant if your body couldn't handle it. You stop ovulating. Look that up too. Also when you are pregnant your body has hormones running wild. I don't think it is fair to say that women can think 100% clearly when they are pregnant. I am not saying that pregnant women are crazy or incompetent. It is a proved fact that you have extra hormones in your body, adding stress/environment/relationship/health/a... financial situations that's a lot to take in. <br>      Fourth. I find it personally assaulting for you to say that abortion is a better way to go. My parents adopted four children. They are my brothers and sisters. I am there when they experience joy, love, hurt, guilt, pain, happiness, and those moments where it is all wrapped up into one. I bless their birth parents everyday for giving my family the chance to be blessed by them. You are stating that you want the whole triad. But you're only looking at one side of the triangle. You're looking at the easy road. Would it have been easier for their parents to have gotten an abortion. HELL YEAH!!! It's called instant gratification. But they were able to make their mistake/wrong decision/bad timing whatever you want to call it. into someones blessing.<br>  How can you discredit that?!? How can you bad mouth that? How can you say that it is emotionally better?|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	As a firstmom, I suffered greatly after giving my child up. It was years of heartache and depression. I couldn't talk about her and I couldn't stop thinking about her. In 1972, abortion was illegal  (not sure I could have had one) and closed adoption was the norm, so only a handful of people knew the secret I had. <br>  In 2001 I looked and found my daughter, she was almost 30 and we have been in a pretty good reunion since then, We are both happy to have each other in our lives again. <br>  Adoption should only be chosen in the event of abuse or parental death.|`|aqto0hJTaa	Your point is that being dead is better than being adopted.  Wow.<br>  <br>  Edit:  This is what you said:  "I do believe that adoption is only beneficial to the adoptive parents."  That means the baby is better off dead (aborted) than adopted.<br>  <br>  Edit again:  You're still saying the same thing.  You removed the biological parent from the scenario.  Now you're trying to add it back in.  You can't have it both ways.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	No matter what you say, you are basically saying that being dead is better than being adopted. Also you really have no clue what abortion can do to the person that aborted do you?  I spent over 10 years talking and counseling women in these situations, and I can tell you story after story that they wished they had never aborted, and that they had placed for adoption instead.  Granted receiving a child through adoption, makes us parents- however, killing a baby does not benefit the woman, anymore than the child.  The child physically dies, has no choice or chance of living a full life- and the birth mom lives with guilt and shame. Not a good thing, if you really look at this logically, even. You don't have to have a relationship with God to feel this way. I do, but many pro-lifers do not believe in God.  So you are saying it would have been better for my 2 adopted children to be aborted in the womb?  Sorry, I beg to differ, and you know what, so do they!  So what if the biological mother knows beyond a shadow of a doubt that they could not be the mother that they desperately wanted to be for their children. It would be better to be raised with them, then placed for adoption? Please|`|Tjr9aObNaa	How can adoption not benefit a child as as well as the adoptive parent?

It was horrid!  It took about 6 months and he was very scared to poop.  He actually did a few times and then, poof!, no more!  He would say he was scared and I cannot tell you how many times I have had to take a garden hose and take his pants waaayyy out back and then do a double wash in hot water.  I hated that part!  <br>  Anyway, my son is also in preschool and was at the time I was potty training.  I asked his teachers (both have masters degrees in early childhood edu. and tons of experience at a top rate preschool) and they said it is 100% totally and completely NORMAL for kids to all of the sudden be afraid to poop, even after doing it for a while.  It is also VERY normal for them only to feel comfortable going in one place and if they are somewhere unfamiliar, they will not want to.<br>  The teachers both said that many many parents have this problem.  <br>  I thought the same thing, I need to take him to the doctor b/c something could be wrong but as long as she isn't displaying signs of being in pain, you should be okay on your own.<br>  I thought about the hard stool too but I was told (later) by a doctor when I mentioned it that that is HIGHLY unlikely to inhibit them.  They basically said that a child will not stop pooping on the potty just b/c of a hard stool.<br>  I hope this helps, good luck.
7xit1ogxaa	It is rare, but it is very possible. I know this because I used to have a bicornuate uterus (my uterus was heart-shaped and divided in half). I became pregnant four times while I had a bicornuate uterus, sadly I experienced 3 miscarriages and one stillbirth. However, during all of my pregnancies I actually had a baby on one side of my uterus and on the other side I was ovulating and receiving a period every month. My husband and I actually had to use protection since there was a chance I could become pregnant on the other side.

The reason why this cannot be is that pregnancy and menstruation cannot take place at the same time, by the very definition of the two. If you were pregnant and you began menstruating you would inevitably lose the pregnancy, or have a miscarriage. While you cannot have your period and continue to be pregnant at the same time you can experience vaginal bleeding and continue to be pregnant. It is often this vaginal bleeding that women believe is their menstrual cycle when it is not.<br>  <br>  Early pregnancy bleeding is not at all uncommon and many women report that they do bleed regularly during the early portion of their pregnancies. This is not at all a menstrual cycle though; it is usually referred to as early pregnancy bleeding. This bleeding is usually is due to hormonal changes and is not of the quantities of blood that a woman typically sees when having her normal menstrual period. Early pregnancy bleeding can vary in amounts from slight spotting to vaginal bleeding consistent with a menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  Another reason for bleeding during pregnancy is something called implantation bleeding. This bleeding usually takes place when the embryo is attaching to the wall of the uterus. This type of bleeding is ordinarily seen five days after conception, so it is easy to see why a woman would confuse this bleeding with her menstrual cycle and there may be some difficulty in determining when the last menstrual period was. Implantation bleeding is not all that common and usually is not more than a slight spotting or a pinkish red colored mucus, but occasionally there is more bleeding associated with it.<br>  <br>  Getting pregnant while on the pill is often associated with bleeding during pregnancy that can be confused with a menstrual cycle. Many women who are on the pill have several bleeding episodes before they realize that something is not quite right. In cases like this a woman usually cannot accurately tell her doctor when her last real menstrual cycle was and an ultrasound is required to provide the mother and the doctor with an estimated due date.<br>  <br>  There are many reasons, as stated above, that a woman can experience vaginal bleeding while pregnant but it is impossible to have a true period and remain pregnant at the same time. The problem is that much of the bleeding that women experience coincides with the same time that they usually see their menstrual cycle each month, so they naturally assume that it is their period. Luckily, the majority of women do not experience this type of bleeding.|`|HQE8Yvicaa	I'm actually wondering the same thing!

DDYwnut6aa	Every day is fine if there are no sperm issues.  Sperm can live for 3-5 days in wait for the egg.  You should try to hit as many fertile days 9the 4 days leading up to ovulation and ovulation day) as possible.  The day after, well, the egg will only live for 12-24 hours, so there is a *slim* chance of conception from intercourse the day after.  But you really want sperm to be waiting when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  As for your ovulation day, if you aren't charting and you're using a calculator, you should know that your body will ovulate when it's ready, not by a calendar.  Check out <a href="http://www.fetilityfriend.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fetilityfriend.com</a>  There is a free online course you can take there that will teach you to read your body's fertility signs and predict ovulation much more accurately than an online calculator.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lhn1wNoeaa	3days before,ovulation days and the next day of ovulation.

You may not be ready to talk about it or act on it.  This may also represent the birth of a new idea, direction, project or goal. <br>  <br>  To dream that you are pregnant with the baby dying inside of you, suggests that a project you had put a lot of effort into is falling apart and slowly deteriorating. Nothing is working out the way you want it to.  <br>  <br>  If you are really pregnant and having this dream, then it represents your anxieties about the pregnancy.  Women in the first  trimester of their pregnancy tend to dream of tiny creatures, fuzzy animals, flowers, fruit and water. In the second trimester, dreams will reflect your anxieties about being a good mother and concerns about possible complications with the birth. Dreams of giving birth to a non-human baby are also common during this period of the pregnancy. Finally, in the third trimester, dreams consists of your own mother.

Every year I hear horror stories about certain teachers in the next grade up -  teachers who are mean, rude, unfair, don't know how to teach, etc, etc, etc.  And I worry myself sick that my kids will end up in that class.  Of course, it never fails - we ALWAYS get the teacher that everyone hates. And people warn me, "Try to get out of that class!"  But it's always the same - my kids end up loving that teacher!  In fact, the one time my daughter did get the teacher that everyone thought was soooo sweet, was the worst year ever!  So yeah - now I don't let other parents' opinions worry me.

You'd have to let you child cry for hours and hours, days and you'd also have to neglect their basic needs like letting them go hungry for hours and allowing your child to stay in a dirty diaper for hours on end.

rDlCTXVLaa	yes it sure does, and it makes it harder to see the baby on an ultrasound, or hear the heartbeat with a fetal doppler as early as an average size girl, but u should feel something eventually, no matter what size u are. Congrats on the pregnancy & enjoy :) don't worry about the extra weight right now.|`|zwctZ812aa	Yes, I've heard that being a little heavier can make it harder to feel your baby's movements, but I am tiny and didn't feel my son until 20 weeks.  I think it has a lot to do with the baby and the position he or she is also.  If the baby is sitting far back like towards the spine then it might take longer to feel movements.  That was the issue with my son.  He was back pressing on my spine the whole pregnancy so I experienced some things a little differently.  I never felt the flutters with him...just went straight to little jabs.  IT felt more like a goldfish flopping out of water to me lol|`|QSodlfMraa	yes, that is what they say.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	The placenta could be rooted in the front and the baby has to kick through extra padding for you to feel it also. If you are overweight then I would think the movement is harder to feel but its a known fact that front placenta makes it harder to feel til they are stronger. Also it could be kicking more at night or into your back , I know I didn't feel mine kick for a while either. I think I was 19 weeks.and that was iffy. i wasn't sure if it was movement or gas.|`|IA1irLy7aa	i have heard that with larger woman you may not be able to feel the baby move as early as a smaller woman but that is hear say. i am 15 weeks pregnant with baby number two and had a scan done at 14 weeks and the sono lady said i probably wont feel my baby move until about 18-19 weeks because my placenta is at the front. i would ask the doctor.|`|TxYcs9H9aa	Yes, being overweight can cause you to feel the baby later than you otherwise would.  These people who are saying your weight wouldn't affect feeling movement have no idea what they're talking about.|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	weight don't have anything to do with it|`|NVxGp317aa	I am a have some extra weight on me as well and I to became a little concerned when those around me that were pregnant where feeling baby move and I was not. My dr said heavier women do tend to feel movements later but then again all women are different. I felt littlee butterfly tickle feelings at about 18 weeks 5 days and really started to feel movement about 22 weeks. I am almost 25 weeks now and their is no doubt about it the baby is moveing. Just relax it will be comming soon.|`|112f0c4c567e4823d4c52fd51985ad71aa	you weight has nothing to do with it. and every baby is different.<br>  the position of the placenta is what can affect the the way you feel the baby move. and the baby may sleep while you are awake and move when you sleep, that is what happened to me. but i have had 2 children each one different and my aunt had 10 and the movement of all the baby's we so different so don't worry but if you still feel that some thing is not right talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  i hope that this helps|`|RLbN2Ujhaa	Your weight very much effects your ability to feel those early movements. But for what it's worth, I am almost 17 weeks with #4, so I know what the feelings are, and I underweight and still haven't felt anything with this one. With #1, it was 19 wks, #2 15 wks, #3 17 weeks.|`|p2OUNHjyaa	I will tend to agree that excess weight could cause you not to feel them as soon|`|piCMW7ZCaa	every baby is different!

60c23c4e75582a183b256dc1695d7638aa	My son is almost 2 1/2, he's 3 feet tall and 32lbs and is still in a 5 point harness in his car seat. He'll have to stay in the harness until his shoulders are above the highest slots, then he can use a regular seat belt in his car seat. <br>  <br>  Your child will be in a booster seat probably up to the age of 7 or 8. It all depends on their height and weight. My bestfriend's daughter was real tall, but skinny too, so when she was 7 she still had to use a booster seat. Sucks...but it's for her own good.<br>  <br>  Look up the laws in your state. I think they do vary from state to state. Next time you're out and about, stop by your local police department and ask them. They would surely know!|`|02d8b50a9d75922bc496ff2a4c76185baa	Ask your pediatrician.  If he still fits comfortably in the car seat, what is the rush to put him in a booster.  All 2 year olds are different and if he sits there still and nice, AND if he meets the weight and height requirements, then do it.  But my 3 year old is still in her car seat because she is all over the place and she is too wild for me to sit her in a booster which she can easily get out of if she wanted to.  I think no matter what the law says, you are the only one that knows what your child is ready for.  So if by law he can upgrade to the booster but you know he is better off in the car seat, keep him there till you feel he is ready.|`|AA11256693	Take a look on the web at child crash-test dummies and what can happen to children not in proper carseats and you won't be in such a hurry to take away your baby's protection.<br>  My daughter is 5 1/2, 36 pounds and still in a 5 point harness seat, and she will stay that way until she outgrows the seat - which tops out 65 pounds forward facing.|`|ZyiVlnINaa	actually, i was in a booster until i was about 6.  sure at six did i like it, not really...but looking back im glad my mom made me because of safety precautions.  better safe than sorry, but ask around with other moms or find a website about childcare in that bracket. hope this helped!|`|Yvs6ik1Gaa	It depends on your state.  In Michigan they have to be in some kind of booster seat until they are eight or over four feet ten inches tall|`|TvJP4pVxaa	I think he had to be at least 75-80lbs last time i heard any thing about it|`|Z7HHGz7Raa	I thought it was technically 75lbs|`|BmZFsuZCaa	when he is 4 or 5 depending. <br>  He has to weigh 65 pounds and has to be 4 feet i think|`|orIm38DEaa	when he is 4'8" and 50 lbs.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	He can ride in a booster seat in 2 years plus 8 lbs.   Without booster seat?   Probably several years more then that.   Until he's 4 years and 40lbs he needs to stay in his car seat when in a car.|`|b6e3e5765ea9340b4ffd975bfca501aaaa	It depends on your state.<br>  <br>  In my state you have to be 8 years or 65 pounds or 4'9" to ride without a booster.<br>  <br>  And your child should be AT LEAST 40 pounds before moving to a booster - longer if you can manage it.|`|cEXzXkqnaa	you can switch to a booster when he hits 40lbs<br>  But i know kids as old as 9yrs who still ride in a booster...<br>  I tam pretty sure it's 80lbs to go without<br>  It is waaaay safer to be in some kind of safety seat...<br>  stick with it as long as you can|`|AFi5kTiEaa	He should be in a 5 point harness car seat untill 4.  Then a booster untill he is tall and big enough so the seatbelt fits him correctly.

The zipper is highly uncomfortable if you've had a C-section & 2. You're still going to be a little bit "puffy".

All they have to do is roll the balls around with some pressure, so they don't wear out their hands, and they feel great.<br>  <br>  If you're having a natural child birth, a yoga ball can be a good addition.|`|jNErU39iaa	It depends how long your hospital stay is but you will need:<br>  - Camera<br>  - Any extras you want to have while in labour (cd’s, massage oil, heat pack etc)<br>  - A dress/nighty to give birth in that you can THROW AWAY – because it will most likely be ruined :P<br>  - Nursing bra and nursing pads<br>  - Slippers<br>  - Pj’s<br>  - Comfortable outfits (dark colours for pants)<br>  - Maternity sanitary pads – and lots of them<br>  - Toiletries such as shampoo, conditioner, deodorant, moisturizer, lip balm, make up<br>  - Hair clips, hair ties (whatever you like to keep hair off your face)<br>  - Brush or comb<br>  - Toothbrush and toothpaste<br>  - Cell phone, charger and list of people to call<br>  - Remember to bring all your important medical documents (medical history etc)<br>  - Maybe a book or Ipod for your hospital stay after baby is born  <br>  <br>  For Baby<br>  - Car seat<br>  - Bunny rugs (for wrapping)<br>  - Onesies, or other baby clothes, singlets (as many as you think you will need) and bring a few different sizes as well<br>  - Mittens, as babies nails are often sharp and they scratch themselves easily<br>  - Nappies, wipes (in case your hospital doesn’t provide these)<br>  -You may also need to supply, baby wash, lotion, face washer for babies first bath <br>  <br>  Any thing else you think you will need<br>  Good Luck!!|`|NSMV0XCEaa	Pillow<br>  Very comfortable clothes<br>  You will want to take your own pads becuase the ones that the hospital offers suck<br>  Camera<br>  Something to focus on while in labor (pictures are great)<br>  Socks<br>  House shoes<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  For The Baby,<br>  Clothes (the ones from the hospital are plain)<br>  Wipes and Diapers<br>  Socks<br>  Mittens<br>  Bottles if you plan to bottle feed.(This way the baby gets use to the bottles you have at home)<br>  Boppy Pillow|`|xRpZ9nmfaa	alll bathing supplies such as towels shampoo conditioner soap a brush toothbrush toothpaste and huuuuge pads lol<br>  a camera thats fully charged or a unused disposable.<br>  slippers of flip flops way comfy clothes<br>  diapers and blankets and clothes for baby.<br>  ummm lets see i think thats about it...oh any tons of snack unless you want u want hospital food or for your husband rinning to go get you something everytim your hungry...that should do it :)good luck|`|QzgkN2LZaa	baby outfit<br>  night gowns for you<br>  socks for you and baby<br>  sports bra<br>  breast pads<br>  large underwear<br>  underwear pads<br>  pillow<br>  blanket<br>  onzie<br>  baby hat<br>  phone list<br>  well thats all i can think of right now!!<br>  hope it helps!!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Comfortable clothes, not your pre-pregnancy stuff.

TQwkS4NVaa	Okay, so here's the deal, I played softball like 9 years(I still play) and the truth is, there will always be someone who's better or just as good as you are, whether they be on your team or someone else's. That said, don't be nervous. The biggest key with any sport is confidence, everytime a girl tries out for our team and she says I suck, I'm terrible, I've not played for a long time the team does a collective groan. Do not let it be known that you're nervous, and act like you were born to play softball. I can really spot the positive when people are confident, if they say they suck, I can totally see how. <br>  <br>  Think of your good points, are you a good base runner, hitter, catcher, fielder, pithcer etc? Let it be known. The biggest thing I think is to not be nervous and to really show the coaches that you're really good. Trust me I've been in your position, I tried out for my softball team who went to Nationals, and I thought gosh there's no way I'll make it all these girls are amazing, but as soon as I got on the field, I found out, I had strengths where some of them had weaknesses,and I made the team. I had a great season. The key is to have fun, be confident, and never think you're not good enough, because chances are, you are good enough!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK AT YOUR TRYOUTS!!!!!|`|nzyOCsOiaa	Oh well, i do softball too and i just started last year. <br>  All of the people were sooo much better than me (even the ones who were like, 3 years younger.)<br>  Here's the thing; you run in softball. A lot. So i suggest you start jogging already and getting up the endurance for it. <br>  The people on my team are kinda bratty too at first, but they got nicer. Honestly, the probably feel threatened by new players because the new players might turn out better than they are.<br>  Don't worry about the players, they'll get used to you, it's the game you gotta keep at. Try asking a friend to join with you. I joined with my best friend and she made it a lot better.<br>  Just one last tip: if you like it, keep doing it. It's hard at first (really hard) but it gets easier and more fun everyday.

35JIECGRaa	If you want something sweet, I would go with Julianne ... if you want something more bold and outgoing, I would go for Gia.<br>  <br>  Both name choices are great, so it is hard to say, but for me personally I would probably go with Julianne (Gia is a guilty-pleasure name).|`|WVRw1tMxaa	Nothing is wrong with either name.  Personal preferance between the two - Julianne.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Gia|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I like both but woul prefer Gia.|`|HBgnkltfaa	I prefer Julianne.  It sounds much more substantial, and it has a lot of cute nickname possibilities.<br>  <br>  I went to college with a Gia, and I always thought her name seemed like it was missing something.  Gia, Mia, Pia, and event the Latinate spelling of Lia all feel rather small and insubstantial to me.  <br>  <br>  Still, both are good names -- they're interesting, pretty, feminine, and not extremely common.  Which do YOU like better?|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I like Gia but only as a nickname for a longer name.  julianne isn't that bad but i like the other one better if you go with a longer version.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	Julianne|`|9FOHmjN3aa	Julianne!<br>  Julianna or Julia are even better though!|`|d3BZlRyhaa	Julianne i love it :)|`|ettl7gALaa	Gia|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Julianna, without a doubt!<br>  <br>  Gia wouldn't be bad if it was a pet name for Gianna though.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Julianne, I guess.|`|Ne58NIDGaa	I dont mind Gia at all, however if she wants a nickname the only alternate to her actualy name is G.

ARUVea4yaa	i'd say go with glasses and thats cool that your dad is in a band, usually they will ask for ID though and if you don't have it they most likely wont let you in|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	you poor thing I thought 27-30|`|MigBOiUPaa	u could so pass! u look cute in both pics!|`|fb1K9Jlwaa	I think you could pass for 16, but not 18. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you're not drinking, by law bars cannot allow 14-year-olds to enter. Being with the band is not going to mitigate that fact. Sorry. Since you look under 18, they are going to card you and you won't be permitted to enter - it's too much of a liability for the bar.|`|8cd6d1064a8d6379febc6914e867a26baa	You do look older than 14, but I dont think it would matter, as long as you dont drink, that you go see your dads band.

aPscVrOoaa	I think it is possible to feel them there at 21 weeks. I'm 25 weeks now and I guess I haven't thought much about where he kicks, but he's all over the place at different times. Sometimes high and other times low.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	This is my second and I've been feeling movement since about 12 or 13 weeks. I'm 20 now and they are all the time. I can even feel her moving around.

The movements you feel will get stronger and more frequent in the nex few weeks.|`|KhugcExyaa	yes i did at 6 or 7mths|`|AVqV2Q9waa	yes you cant the baby probably changed positions most likely. when i was 21wks i felt it all over it was like she was rolling around in there it was crazy. n e ways yea probably possible it just moved|`|rDlCTXVLaa	I was feeling light  movement at 16 weeks. at 21 weeks I was feeling them pretty good already.|`|0w8EmVjTaa	Very possible.

I don't know what was up with it, we put it together right, and had everything right in it, I guess it just didn't work, so we took it back. I just ended up buying the baby einsteins turtle thing that hooks on his crib, it lights up and fish swam around in it, and it played music, and my son really liked it, he actually still does and he's a year old now. I'm sure that product you have up there is a good one, I think the one I bought what defective though?|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I've never seen one before, but have you tried Ebay?  Its a great place to find almost anyting/.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	We had the bird one, I think it had ceiling lights.  Got it at a resale shop for $6.
4BBjhHAnaa	I'm not a parent, but these are the ages in my family:<br>  <br>  26<br>  <br>  19 (me)<br>  <br>  17<br>  <br>  15<br>  <br>  9<br>  <br>  <br>  Quite a difference between the oldest and youngest!  But the three of us in the middle are pretty close in age.<br>  <br>  The hard parts about kids at different ages is that they are going through different stages at different times . . . dealing with teenagers while also going through the terrible twos! And things like that.<br>  <br>  The hard part about kids the same age is that they are all doing the same thing at the same time . . .  By the time one is done with the terrible twos, the next one is ready!<br>  <br>  The upside of kids of vastly different ages is that you already know the game, and the older ones can help out and act as role models (hopefully positive ones) for the younger kids.<br>  <br>  The upside of having kids all the same age, is that your life is more routine as everyone is doing that same sorts of things.  Everyone is in school and interested in the same sorts of things at the same time.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Which one is better, I think, really depends on your kids.<br>  For instance, when we were younger, I hated my brother and he always picked on me.  Now, however, we all take a hand in raising my youngest sister.  In some ways, this is chaos, because we will contradict each other and it sometimes bothers my mom that we are parenting her daughter.  On the other hand, it gives her the chance to have the career she chose not to while she had the rest of us running around as little ones.<br>  So you see, though the differences between me and my brother are about the same as between the youngest and the rest of us, how we reacted to those gaps is vastly different.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think the hardest part of all of it in my family is the two youngest.  Where as the rest of us had each other to play with (my brother was antisocial and my mom could focus solely on him when he was little) the youngest now has no one in her age group to entertain her.  So, the 15 year old has had the responsibility of keeping her occupied, especially when they were a little younger.<br>  <br>  This contributed to stunting the 15 year old's maturity.  Now that she is in high school she is a lot better, but we were afraid for a while that she was acting too young and would have trouble with her peers.  On top of that, the two of them have a lot of resentment for each other out of being "forced" to play together.  They still choose, most of the time, to do things together, but it usually results in a fight :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In short, I'm no parent, but I'd have to say they both have their ups and downs :)|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	closer is harder because the kids need the same kind of attention and interaction ..I had most of mine 5 yrs apart...the irish twins were the most difficult and draining|`|yDWcYXl5aa	I have a 20 year old, and a 17 month old, and now, I'm trying to adopt again.  <br>  <br>  I've taken care of lots of kids close to the same age for months at a time, and there's things about it that's easier, and things that are harder. <br>  <br>  As a more experienced mom, I truly appreciate the little moments a lot more than when I did with my oldest.|`|ZzoOl8xYaa	far apart deffinitely. if they are close together they fight so much. plus the older one can help out with the younger one.|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	farther apart|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	Both have there ups and downs...it depends tho.|`|JAinouoUaa	i think its harder having kids closer together because when you have a young child and a newborn they both require your attention all of the time. When you have an older child, they could help you with the younger child and you wouldn't be as tired.|`|80zoY5OYaa	i have a 2yr old and i have a 5 week old too they are both girls.<br>  i should have waited cause 2yr old puts pacifiers in her mouth. and acts like a baby.
f59c7c70e6dd2cd48c08f7ac5aec140aaa	It could be the milk change, or maybe his body is getting rid of a small infection or virus.  It's no big deal.  Seriously, be glad he's pooping!!  Bring it up to your doctor in 2 days.  It's probably no big deal.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	I can't believe he's on whole milk, my son was changed to 2 percent when coming off formula.  You may want to dilute his juice (half water half juice) and see if his bowels firm up some.  They usually can't tolerate full strength at first.
qxm5mwqjaa	weight gain?  odd periods?  real crampy?  if yes then probably.|`|BthSjSEHaa	Sounds just like me, and I definitely have PCOS. I would suggest getting a scan at the doctors, then you'll know for sure. And don't fret too much - just because you have PCOS doesn't mean you can't conceive, it just makes it a little more difficult as the cycle is all over the place. Fingers crossed for you!
782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	I worked up to the day I had my baby girl. I was only able to take 6 weeks paid maternity leave, so I decided to use it for when she was born to spend as much time with her!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	i reckon 35-36 weeks. since baby is alreadyengaged she may come sooner than 40 weeks. try 37 weeks. So you spend more time with bubs...<br>  <br>  When ever you feel that you cant. leave daring. <br>  Dont push your body . you and baby are most important :)<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|BzCYQlcuaa	i would work as long as you can. that way you can take more time with the baby.... my best friend had 3 months and she worked up until the week she was due( approve by her doctors) and then she had a little less than 3 months to be home with her baby! also depend on your job and how you feel!<br>  congrats|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	Work as long as you can! You will want that time with your little one more then you want the time to relax. I worked until I was 41 weeks with my first, and up until the delivery with #2. I am a teacher, so it is a very physical job, no sitting around for me. I know how hard it is and I know what it is like to walk around feeling like that baby is going to drop out of your body at any second, but that being said, in the US maternity leave is not enough, and when time ends with your baby, whether you have had 3 months or a year you will wish you had more time with them. The bonus is that it makes the time go so much faster until when  your baby comes.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I would base it on how much time you get for maternity leave with your employer.  My job only gives me 6 weeks (8 weeks for a c-section) so I'm going to try to hold out till the very end so I can give that 6 weeks to my baby.  Fortunately I have FMLA right now for intermittent leave so I can miss for doctors appointments and sicky days.  I get 12 weeks total so I plan on making sure I don't use more than 2 weeks on that so I'll have a cushioned 10 for the baby (just in case).  If your time is more flexible I'd leave now...give myself the extra time to get prepared emotionally, mentally and get all loose ends tied up.  Either way...you know you...do what you need to mommy!  (My work stresses me out alll the time too...I'm a lead for a team of 10 and 5 people called in today!!!)|`|T0IjwHSkaa	37 weeks sounds about right cause at 37 weeks youll have about 3 weeks before having the baby, but if you really cant wait it out then i wonder if u could just talk to your boss and let him or her know that its been real hard for you and see if theyll be okay with letting you go on maternity leave sooner :) congrats on the pregnancy!|`|AA12373051	i would work has long as you can handle what ever your work load is maybe your boss could give you a less streesful assignment untile you reach your leave date. but dont overdue it. good luck.
dN5BJeVpaa	Jeremy - I love this name! I fell in love with it when "Jeremy" by Pearl Jam came out (I know it's a horrible reference for the name, but I still love the name!). It sounds so innocent and boyish. The con is that there aren't any apparent nicknames. <br>  Diego - I don't really like it. I think of Dora the Explorer. And then I think San Diego. It's more than it's associations I don't like - it has a weird sound. <br>  Simon - I like Simon. I think it deserves to comeback. It needs to be relieved of it's "mathlete genius" association. I love Simon & Garfunkel. I love Simon Says. I mean, if names like Oliver and Sebastian can become popular - this one can certainly survive nasty children's comments. <br>  Duncan - I think of Macbeth. I don't even know if Duncan was a character. I sounsd medievil and lame in my opinion. Sorry, but I really don't like this name. <br>  Wesley - I'm in between on this name. It's a nice name, but it sounds too boyish. I always think of a fair haired, small young boy. Even when i've met Wesleys in their teens, they were always small, blonde, and boyish. <br>  Leo - I love Leo! It's such a sweet name. I like it so much better than Leonard, or Leonardo - Leo is just perfect. It's charming, mysterious, and still masculine. <br>  Ernest - This name is too classic for me. I usually love classic, old days names. It might just be because i'm really not a fan of Hemingway - but this name seems too old for me.<br>  Caleb - I like Caleb. It's a little common today, but it's still really cute and masculine. It doesn't have that wow factor for me though - it seems to lack character and definition. <br>  Aubrey - I wish more people would realize this is a boy's name! I love Aubrey for a boy. Even though it's used on girls, it's such a manly name. I love Aubrey, Shannon, Alexis, and Tracy on boys  they fit so well!<br>  Adrian - I really love Adrian. It's really charming, and slightly feminine which I like. It's not very cute or boyish - but big deal. It's a really nice name.|`|0jaJuOTFaa	Leo - 1 - cool and masculine name<br>  Duncan - 2 - I like the mane, kinda sweet<br>  <br>  The rest... I don't really like<br>  Ernest - sounds really old and I don't like Erny as a nick name <br>  Caleb - biblical name and means Dog in Hebrew<br>  Aubrey - don't like the sound<br>  Adrian - not a big fan<br>  Jeremy - ok-ish but nothing special<br>  Diego - not a big fan<br>  Simon - a bit old... but Simy as a nick name is cute<br>  Wesley - all the Wesleys I know are way too full of themselves, just a bad vibe|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	jeremy is the best..lol tats my 15months old name<br>  <br>  1. jeremy<br>  2. simon<br>  3.caleb<br>  4. duncan<br>  <br>  i dont like any of the others|`|NNki7qiFaa	I like Caleb, Adrian, Duncan, and Simon ;)|`|nZgatTIHaa	Duncan and Simon are the best.

Duncan, Adrian, and Aubrey are ok. I don't like Jeremy, Wesley, or Caleb.|`|EdCQwXyQaa	jeremy sounds like a cute and funny name and simon sounds like a cute and kind of serious name i like both but i would prefer jeremy it is a good name for when they are young and older.|`|v6YcSPVjaa	I really like them all. It is actually really hard to pick a favorite and I will give an average rating of 9.4. They are all really nice in their own way. Too hard to choose for me! By the way, I love your blog!|`|sIqzhWMLaa	Since your last name is one syllable, I'd go with a longer first name, like Adrian or Wesley. I'm partial to the name Adrian. :)|`|M7Ozqujtaa	I LOVE all those names.<br>  I really think Leo Wesley or Wesley Leo would be a awesome name!<br>  <br>  <br>  Jeremy Leo is also good.<br>  <br>  <br>  You have good taste.<br>  <br>  God Bless.|`|EIgmm8ilaa	Jeremy - 8<br>  Diego - 2<br>  Simon - 3<br>  Duncan - 3<br>  Wesley - 9<br>  Leo - 7<br>  Ernest - 2<br>  Caleb - 5<br>  Aubrey - 4<br>  Adrian - 5|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Of the list, I favor Jeremy, Caleb and Adrian.|`|u7UnUZXnaa	i love Jeremy<3|`|CxRJwJsraa	Jeremy- I've always liked this name. It just has this friendly feel. Like, I can imagine having great guy friends named Jeremy...and at the same time, I could totally picture a hot guy named Jeremy (now, I know you aren't going for "hot" with your baby, but we all know that babies grow up).<br>  Diego- I like the sound of this, and I'd be all for it, especially since you have Mexican heritage...but now all I think is Dora and Diego.<br>  Simon-love this and it feels very similar to Jeremy. friendly. Simon leans a little dorky to me, but in that cute dorky smart-guy kinda way.<br>  Duncan- I like this as well...but we are getting even more in the nerdy category. <br>  Wesley- i like it, and again, it's similar to Jeremy to me, but i see Wesley as a little more shy and timid. <br>  Leo- love it. he's hip and artsy.<br>  Ernest- I still tend to think of Ernest from the movies (ie, Ernest Goes to Jail). I like the name when I think of it as a virtue name, a la Earnest. I think this one may be better left to the middle name.<br>  Caleb- it's similar to the other Bible names on your list, but this one feels distinctively more modern, thanks to the K sound.<br>  Aubrey- I like this, I really do. I am just not 100% sure I'd use it, simply for fear that it will seem too girly. BUT, it would make an awesome middle name (think, Simon Aubrey).<br>  Adrian- this name goes two completely different ways for me. one. handsome suave Italian guy or two Adrian Monk from the tv show Monk...and honestly, I like it either way.<br>  <br>  Jeremy, Simon, Wesley, and Leo are my FAVES!!|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Jeremy 7.5/10:  I think this is a really cute name, and so much nicer than Jeremiah (the Bullfrog). I'm not keen on Jerry as a nn (thanks Jerry Springer) and I prefer Jem, but you might think that's a bit too hillbilly. Jeremy is an old country word for a robin redbreast, which I think is cute as well. <br>  <br>  Diego 6/10:  I actually think this is a great name and very handsome. But  apart from the other associations that people have mentioned, Diego was used as the basis of a racist term, and that would bother me.  <br>  <br>  Simon 7.5/10:  I think this is in a very similar name style to Jeremy - both cute English-style names. I might give a slight preference to Simon over Jeremy as I think the name sounds smoother and more suitable to an adult (but not sure if it would suit your surname as well as Jeremy). Literary association - Simon Cotton, the American romantic hero of "I Capture the Castle".<br>  <br>  Duncan 8/10:  I love this name! Not only for its Shakespearean and Scottish background, but because it sounds quite rugged, manly and unpretentious. It also has a positive word in it - "can", which I think makes a name more upbeat.<br>  <br>  Wesley 6/10:  I just don't have a real love for this name, I'm afraid. I can see it's handsome and has a strong religious/church background to it, but for some reason I've never warmed to it. I can easily understand other people loving it though.<br>  <br>  Leo 9/10:  Just a brilliant name all round. It's short and easy to spell and pronounce while still having two syllables. It's an ancient name yet it's also modern and very familiar. It's Latin for "lion" so it sounds strong and brave and masculine. No wonder it's a classic!<br>  <br>  Ernest 6/10:  Quite apart from the Muppet association, I just think Ernest is a lumpish sort of name - I never seem to like these Hanoverian names for some reason!<br>  <br>  Caleb 8/10:  Really gorgeous Biblical name; very strong and masculine sound to it. It means "dog" so it sounds dogged and loyal. <br>  <br>  Aubrey 8/10:  I think this is one of the most handsome men's names around; lovely upper-class sound to it and interesting history that relates it to Wagner's "Ring Cycle" and Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream". However, I think some people are going to say it is too feminine-sounding.<br>  <br>  Adrian 7/10:  Not really a huge favorite of mine - I actually prefer Hadrian! To me there is something a bit wet-sounding about the name Adrian, but if you want a Roman name that's become anglicized, this would be a good choice. It also looks enough like Aidan to become very popular I think.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Jeremy, Wesley and Duncan are my faves. Jeremy is the cutest name, Wesley is very sophisticated and Duncan is just plain *cool*.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Jeremy-I like this name. Strong and fairly unique 8/10<br>  Diego-For some silly reason this reminds me of Dingo. Is very masculine though which is always a good thing. I still come back to kids calling him Diego the Dingo at primary school though 3/10<br>  Simon-Great name 9/10<br>  Duncan-Eh, It's alright I guess. Not really my taste 4/10<br>  Wesley-I'm not so keen on this one 1/10<br>  Leo-Great name. Short and to the point but still got a bit of rhythm to it. 7/10<br>  Ernest-A bit too old-fashioned for me 5/1-<br>  Caleb-Great name. My favourite out of your list 10/10<br>  Aubrey-Even though this name is originally a boys name it is still associated with girls at the moment and I wouldn't personally use it 0/10<br>  Adrian-Nice name, kinda exotic sounding and a nice alternative to the common Aidan.<br>  <br>  Hope I help :)|`|kPl8TTzNaa	Wow there is some moronic people. Aubrey is masculine and a boy's name. It is not a girl's name. Not feminine. And not girly. It is a masculine boy's name, meaning Elfin King. Kings are male, they will always be male. <br>  <br>  Adrian is a male's name as well. Just because idiotic parents wrongly use these names on girls do not make them girly names, do not make them unisex names, do not make them feminine, and do not make them girly. Sheesh....people.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyways, back to your question. Simon, Wesley, Leo (I prefer it as a nickname for Galileo), Aubrey,  and Adrian are all absolutely wonderful for a boy. And oddly enough I sort of like Ernest as well. I do not see a problem with it, after all, older names are coming back in style, and Ernest seems to fit in with those names.|`|gu1sEQN8aa	ok but im gonna be super honest!<br>  <br>  Jeremy- 10 i love this name, always have it fits all ages.<br>  Diego- eh 5 but it does go with your Mexican heritage<br>  Simon- 10 love this its a beautiful Christian name<br>  Duncan- 0 it just always reminded me of dunce cap or a fat kid im sorry!<br>  Wesley- 8 Love this. Its really usable cause i know a guy with this name he goes by Wes.<br>  Leo- 7 Kind of old fashioned but i like the strong name and it means Lion.<br>  Ernest- 0 no no no lol!  I think of all the Ernest movies<br>  Caleb- 10 i think we have a winner!<br>  Aubrey- 0 too girly even thougbh i know its a boys name<br>  Adrian- 5 just not my style<br>  <br>  I think Jeremy, Simon, and Caleb are your best bets!|`|BBfIXcI0aa	Aubrey is fabulous. I've never heard it before, but I think it would be a nice male name if it was paired with a more masculine middle name.<br>  Adrian is a good name, as well. <br>  I, personally, am partial to the name Wesley, but that's just because of the incredible amount of dashing male protagonists that hold it.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Jeremy, Wesley and Leo the best. I also like Adrian, Aubrey and Duncan. A lot of people want to use Aubrey for girls today, but I like for a boy. <br>  I wouldn't use Diego (Reminds me of the character from the cartoon), Simon (simon says would get annoying to me) or Ernest.|`|S3vYMNzFaa	I dislike Jeremy.  There are a few perfect 'J' names for boys, and I don't think Jeremy is one of them.  Personally, of course - no offense meant to any Jeremies or Jeremy-lovers!  2/10<br>  <br>  Diego is a great name, I think.  It's a little too ethnic for me to use myself (unless I end up marrying someone who comes from a Spanish-speaking background!).  But it's strong and mildly exotic-sounding and can pair fairly easily with a variety of names.  8/10<br>  <br>  I do like Simon.  There's something about it that turns me off.  But there's something about it that draws me to it as well.  So, I am not sure quite how I feel about him.  7/10<br>  <br>  While Duncan has a supercute sound and I love his look on paper...I just can't like him.  I think he's too pet-nameish.  As in Duncan the mutt, not Duncan the boy.  It's a great looking name, though.  4/10<br>  <br>  I'm really turned off by Wesley.  It seems snotty.  The name just oozes "prep" to me, and not in a good way.  I'm sorry!  2/10<br>  <br>  Leo is great!  It's aggressive but not stand-offish.  I also like his longer forms.  But prefer Leo on its own! 10/10<br>  <br>  Secretly, I really, really, really like Ernest.  But, for some reason I feel the need to keep that a secret, which isn't good.  I want to give him a 10/10, but for usability purposes I have to say:  8/10<br>  <br>  Caleb is nice.  Not for me.  I think it's a little lackluster.  Sort of like he's trying to fit in, while standing out, but it's not working.  I don't quite know why I'm so disinterested in him, but... 4/10<br>  <br>  I don't like Aubrey.  It has a silly sound to me.  Just not my style, I suppose.  1/10<br>  <br>  There's something good about Adrian.  But, again, it's not for me.  6/10<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It's odd...I don't see many of these names going together.  It doesn't seem like they belong on the same list from the same person.  They're a little all over the place!  Or maybe that's just me...|`|U1h6Dntjaa	Jeremy - by far, the best name on the list.  It sounds timeless to me, and has long been one of my favorite names.<br>  Diego - I'd avoid this one only because of Dora's little cartoon friend<br>  Simon - This one is also workable.  It's not a favorite, but it has a bit of that nerdy-chic sound that I'm fond of.<br>  Duncan - has surpassed nerdy-chic to be just plain nerdy, IMO.  However, I know that plenty of the upwardly mobile, Maclaren-stroller-pushing moms go for this one.  They find it tres-cool - therefore, it is cool.  (Even if I don't like it much).  Haha<br>  Wesley - Love it.  A tad fey, but if we think about Princess Buttercup's true love when we say the name, everything bad fades away..<br>  Leo - This is a great, great name!  It's spunky, quirky, and quite cool.  <br>  Ernest - I'm sorry, but this name is quite dull.  It's od fashioned, not ready to come back, and the nickname isn't either.  It's best to leave this one to the Muppet.<br>  Caleb - is used by quite a lot of the Wal-Mart set, only they like to spell it with a K.  Avoid whenever possible!<br>  Aubrey - I know you have a special fondness for this name, but I wouldn't do it.  It's too close to Audrey; too many mommies have decided it's a girl name; names ending with -ey (or -ie) tend to sound like nicknames or girl names.<br>  Adrian - Nice.  I think this one (and Francis/Frances) is one of the true unisex names.  It really can go either way (as long as one remembers to spell it correctly.  I hate when people give their daughters the name Leslie, and their sons Lesley.  Don't they research these things?  Haha.)<br>  <br>  Nice list.  Jeremy, good.  Simon, good.  Wesley, good.  Leo,  good.|`|d3BZlRyhaa	Jeremy----9<br>  Diego-----2<br>  Simon-----8<br>  Duncan----7<br>  Wesley-----6<br>  Leo-----1<br>  Ernest------0<br>  Caleb------10<br>  Aubrey-----1<br>  Adrian-----4<br>  <br>  sorry for some of the low ratings.
ee9b7879a87d003e8f82d18baefd1348aa	I have bought all 3 of mine from Hallmark. They are simple and small with places for photos and sonos and pockets and stuff. Oh and lots of blank, lined pages. I think they were each around $10. Congratulations!|`|QAiyrzZbaa	ALOT OF GURLS DO THT,ITS A ASPECIAL TIME YOU WANT AND NEED TO REMEMBER, MY MOM DID IT. ITS ALSO SOMETHING YOU COULD SHOW YOUR KID WHEN IT GETS OLDER|`|Xnr5Y7Coaa	I haven't actually found one, but what I've been doing is typing up my mementos and collecting my pictures, once my pregnancy is over I will make a nice scrapbook type of journal with all that.<br>  <br>  Just an idea.|`|Q3x0yfmtaa	I just used a photo album I picked up at Target.

8yTP3jO8aa	I feel strongly that cell phones have a great purpose when used properly.  They help ensure safety for children and can help overly-scheduled children and parents coordinate their lives.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with teaching correct principles and letting teens govern themselves.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	yes, for emergencies ONLY....get a Trac Fone from Walmart for 15.00 and buy some minutes and have them use it for emergencies to family and thats it or quick calls.....easy way to avoid a LARGE FONE BILL....|`|wabFH7lyaa	Personally, if there was a school shooting i think some one would respond without kids having phones. Kids are so full of them selves they dodon'tven need one. Theyed probbably drop a log on their pants if there was a school shooting or a natural didisasterBesides i think that if that sort of thing were to happen some one would be alerted without texting or cellphones. The sound 9mm or .45 cal pistol or .30 cal rifle can be heard through out a large cacampus'sor college and with todays alarms and security theres nothing to worry about because kids would probbaly want to send their 2 week boyfriend or girlfriend a "I heart you babe even if we die" *wiwhichs lies* messege to them because they think their rebals and a complete badass because they have texting. Kids are stupid, they dont know disasters, love, or common sense. So your answer to kids havhavingll phones is - NO. by the way, im 14 dont let that change your mind on what i said.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	Of course a parent would want to get a message like that *if* something were to happen.Who wouldn't? that's not the issue though with cell phones in schools.<br>  <br>  If keeps kept their cells off during school hours, they wouldn't ruin it for everyone else.That is basically what it comes down to.|`|AA12221392	yes, I do beleive kids should be able to have thier phones on them at all times. <br>  <br>  No, i don't beleive that thye should be texting and using them during school hours unless it is a true emergency, and not just because so and so wanted to tell me something..<br>  <br>  As parents today we have to take every oppurtnity to be able to get a hold of our kids , in case of a emergency and school shootings are happening every day and in every community... <br>  If something bad where going to happen to my child yes , i would love to get that i love you mom message, so they knew that I did hear their cry and was doing everything I could to have been there for them ...

KihffCc5aa	I wasn't able to breastfeed due to meds I was on.  For all of my babies, my Dr.'s told me to just wear a comfortable, well fitting bra all the time.<br>  <br>  I learned the hard way after baby #1.  If you don't wear a bra all the time, your breasts will swell to painful hard footballs and leak CONSTANTLY!  They turn VERY HARD and it's painful.  So if you want to control lactation to the point of stopping naturally, just make sure you always wear a bra that fits snug and comfortable (not TIGHT), and you will probably experience a lot of leaking at first, that will dwindle in the course of 6 weeks or so.  Wear the bra when you sleep, etc., even if you have to invest in a comfortable no-wire one.<br>  <br>  Your breasts will naturally stop producing since it isn't in demand with breastfeeding.  But, it does take around 6 weeks for your breasts to stop producing.  Keep them bound in a bra.<br>  <br>  Please don't listen to breastfeeding advocates.  It's ok to not breastfeed, especially if you can't, or choose not to for whatever your reason.  Formula on the market is very healthy for newborns and babies.  I know, I went through hell with nurses and others slamming me to breastfeed, when I was on meds that would have been - and are now! - questionable to my babies.  My children are formula fed and very healthy!<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	She obviously has her reasoning for not breast feeding, jeez. I won't be able to either, I have to get on heart medication as soon as my baby's born. I'm so sick of hearing people tell me how horrible it is not to, sometimes you just can't. But anyways from what I hear it's basically the old if you don't use it you lose it rule. Good luck to you and your baby.|`|Cx5Zo7IIaa	Drinking sage or parsley tea will help dry you up.

Breastfeeding is awesome...but if you are dead set against it for whatever reason, you don't have to do anything - just wait and it will stop on it's own.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	BREASTFEED its best for a peemie, just pump and bring the milk in|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Its even more important to breastfeed with a preemie.  So no, you shouldnt see about stopping it.  Instead use the opportunity with the nurses there to guide you through nursing, pumping, and kangaroo care.   Good luck.|`|tQsxsuNPaa	You should breastfeed.  It is the way we were made for a reason.  It is, without a doubt, the best thing for your child.
776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	Spitting up is like a wet burp.  Stuff kind of dribbles out of the baby's mouth or the baby burps and a little gush pours out of his mouth and then it's over.  <br>  <br>  Vomiting is usually accompanied by retching, and it's a lot more violent.  There's more stuff coming out and it's coming out in a hurry.  Babies usually cry when they throw up, but are pretty much fine with spitting up.<br>  <br>  If it seems like a baby is spitting up or throwing up almost as much as he's eating, you should call the doctor.  Dehydration becomes an issue.|`|AA11256693	Spitting up is like a soggy burp with milk curds - vomitting will have some force behind it and shoot out rather than just dribble.|`|8NJM0NVvaa	vomiting usually comes with force and you can hear the baby heaving or gagging<br>  spit up just comes out usually without force|`|OWReYgV5aa	When my baby first threw up, I was reminded of the exorcist...lol...which TOTALLY scared the crap out of me.......You will know!!|`|TprIqGhCaa	Vomitting is more painful for them and they'll look like they're sort of in pain.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	vomitting u can hear|`|SDjrojZXaa	if you have to ask you probably have not experienced vomitting. my little man had spit up quite a bit and i thought oh maybe it is vomit....nope when he got the stomache flue unfortunately i learned the difference...it was one of the hardest things i have had to deal with i felt so helpless.|`|14JQ11AUaa	Spitting up is just a little and vomit is A LOT.|`|XOtOMncwaa	I read one time that when a baby spits up it actually looks like the formula that went in. When a baby vomits it looks more like curdled milk, and may have mucus and stuff in it... also when a baby spits up it's just pretty natural looking, it just kinda comes out, when a baby vomits it's more forced.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	From what I've seen and with my son, vomiting seems to have more of it than when babies spit up. I also think you can hear it coming up forcefully with vomiting as opposed to spitting up seems to be more of a burp with "extra".|`|n3IoftMFaa	Spit up is more like they open their mouth and blarf comes out. Vomiting is unmistakable. It is very rare for a baby to vomit but I did have it happen to me - and trust me - you'll know the difference.|`|u94HOVz7aa	my pediatrician said the force behind it. plus vomiting genrally comes out the nose too because off the force behind it.
SaRDq9iLaa	She "talks" to herself and gives me the BIGGEST smile when I go to pick her up out of her crib!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	When he was little, he would start babbling to himself when he woke up and was ready to be up.  If he wanted to sleep more, he would use his "meha" sound.<br>  <br>  Now, when he gets up, he comes running over to my side of the bed, turns on my bedside lamp, says "on", and hands me a remote control saying "clicker watch" so he can have some movie playing while he gets ready in the morning.  Bad habit, maybe, but still cute (most of the time).|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well my son makes 2 different sounds.... <br>  If he's still tired and needs to go back to sleep then he cries... <br>  And if he's awake and ready to go he literally stands up, starts jumping on my bed and screaming "MAMA" it's so cute|`|Lprtz2A9aa	My son makes a wavering giggle, almost birdlike, as soon as he sees someone from his crib. He huffs if I have to wake him up and he still wants to sleep. We here the giggle more often.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	WAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  Every time.  <br>  He cries every time he wakes up.  I don't get it.  Sometimes I will wait in his room when I know he will be getting up very shortly and think that he may not cry if he sees me right there, but he still does.|`|TJezsCkHaa	SOOOOOOOOOOOO Cute.Mine used to wake up crying for there bottles.Enjoy every detail he makes, as they grow so fast.|`|pXSKSS3daa	He just jabbers to his blankets and animals. Not sure what sort of "conversation" he's having with them but it entertains him for a good 15-20 minutes.<br>  <br>  If he wants me to come and get him NOW he'll whine or cry.|`|SDjrojZXaa	My son stands up in the crib and starts jabbering to the fish on his mobile and when i come in he gives me a great big smile and its the best way to start the day! I love it too!

I hate all the variants of it as well: Braydon, Jaden, Caden... I've even seen a Zaidyn on here! That is the dumbest name I've ever heard, sorry.<br>  <br>  And of all the girls' names, I'm definitely sick of Isabella/Bella. It's really become popular with the Twilight series. My dog's name is Bella and she's three. Three years ago, that name was not as popular.<br>  <br>  I'm also really sick of Peyton, Ella, and Grace.

ENANtueuaa	I've never heard of it...i don't think it sounds like a girls name at all..it sounds more like a boys name.|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	I think it sounds like cheese in German.  That's all I can think... I'd say more masculine.  Cheese sounds sort of masculine, and it also has a sound like 'son'...|`|NNki7qiFaa	unisex.|`|5d573e43d278a547e9503d25ae2fcc31aa	I don't think Caysen is a name at all.|`|61NKzPzMaa	Cason is a BOYS name. It ends in SON.<br>  <br>  Caysen is a trashy, ugly made-up spelling of the BOYS name Cason in a bid to make it feminine/unisex.<br>  <br>  The thing is Cason is a masculine BOYS name. There is nothing feminine, girly and there certainly isn't anything unisex about the name Cason.|`|f2osf2iNaa	Honestly, if the kid is in a small school district,<br>  They'll pretty much set the tone for the school anyways.<br>  <br>  If it's a girl the kids will grow up thinking it sounds like a girl.<br>  I personally think it sounds like a boy because I know a boy Caysen.<br>  <br>  Cayson might help the boy sound.<br>  Caysen can be more girly or something.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Boy. I didn't think I was going to but I actually like that name. I do agree with some of the other answers that you may want to consider Cayson. It would be easier for an outsider to pronounce that way. I know how annoying it is to have people constantly mispronounce your name. Good Luck|`|WFwgIF1Faa	I think that it can be either. Cayden is more of a boys name to me, and Carson is more for a girl. I think that is the perfect unisex combo IMO.|`|4ilM2hCwaa	Neither.  Cayson in my experience is a burial mound in Florida.|`|v6YcSPVjaa	I like it more on a boy and I like the spelling Cayson better.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	I guess it's unisex, but it sounds more masculine to me.|`|MikhcVZfaa	Mmm.. that's a tough one. I'd say unisex.|`|uS07WAwcaa	I think it would be unisex like Carson or Grayson (combo)|`|mZi7R0Enaa	female!
AA12245468	Imagination is important too, but it really depends on the subject.<br>  Kids learn early, so why not give 'em the facts early.<br>  <br>  Of course Santa and the Easter Bunny, etc.  can be left alone 'til their older.|`|V7sfV5odaa	My friend (former friend) told her son "the truth" when he was 5.  He went and told ALL of his other little friends.  One of his classmates told the Mom that none of the kids in school like her son.  He is a spoiled brat that NO ONE likes.  He does no wrong in his parents eyes.  Mom is in the Principles office at least once a month.  <br>  <br>  I ask my boys, "What do you think?" They tell me the truth.<br>  <br>  What i am getting at is there are different ways in parenting.   No one can tell you what is right for you.  <br>  <br>  I try to be honest with my boys, they are 8 now.  When they no longer "Believe" I'll be honest with them.  I will tell them I love them, and they will know that's the TRUTH.  They will have memories filled with magic and wonderment.(and that's the truth)  I give them CREDIT that they will know the difference.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	you hit the nail right on the head with your first question.....that is the problem with kids...their parents are not honest with them and then they get older and get angry because they were not taught the right way the first time. because they were lied to. kids are very smart not stupid...I have been telling my son the way things are since he was 5 and he is a well adjusted child not a spoiled brat and he knows more about people and life than other kids his age...now he is 11...!! dont listen to what others say when they tell you to not be honest with your kid. you do what you feel is right....put yourself is your childs shoes!!|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I like evening things out...my kids believe in Santa, but they also know mommy and daddy buys Christmas. We told them Santa makes and delivers the toys, but mommy and daddy have to give him the money to pay the elves and buy the materials. Wink wink. Same for the Easter Bunny. My kids believe in monsters, which I actually encourage in a way. Keeps them from trying to go out the door if they think a monster wants to grab them for going out after dark. <br>  <br>  The know babies don't get brought by the stork and they know that people who die are not just sleeping. Pets that die don't "run away". basically, a bit of fantasy is always okay, as long as you don't fudge the truth on the important stuff.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I don't think either way is better (assuming you are taling about Santa and the Easter Bunny..Tooth Fairy etc) but if you are talking about the Stork ...then it is better to be truthful.|`|bb3299947b02635429d1636917fa08aeaa	Santa, Tooth Fairy, Easter Bunny??   <br>  They are only little once, and the joy and excitement that they experience will last for a lifetime. (for you and them)<br>  <br>  Let them have some fun.<br>  <br>  Tell them the truth when they are really ask for it.  You'll know when.<br>  <br>  Reality is not always what it's cracked up to be.|`|3w7VztEWaa	Be honest.|`|SFNjVMR0aa	be honest from the start|`|eya1WDS4aa	why not let kids be kids, a fairy tale has never hurt a child...
8bHuUJczaa	I have a 7 year old nephew and he loves playing Sorry. He also loved when I made powerpoints for him having to do with his favorite cartoons like spongebob. He also likes playing with toy cars and remote control things. I would recomend playing these  games with both of them:<br>  <br>  .Hide n Seek<br>  . simple board games like, jenga, cooties,etc
aqto0hJTaa	Everyone who's read the book(s) will immediately think you named her after the Twilight characters.<br>  <br>  I haven't watched Days of Our Lives in 25 years, but EVERYBODY assumes my son Roman is named after that character.  Imagine if I'd named him Roman Brady.|`|uS07WAwcaa	umm YES its WAY too twilighty <br>  even one of my teachers daughters name is Isabella and everyones like is it after twilight, so just imagine what it would be like with a name Esme Rosalie|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Sure, it's a cute name but I'm not buying your story that you didn't realize the names were from twilight.|`|35JIECGRaa	Screw the twilight-haters that say "it's too much like Twilight"! I'm not a twilighter or twilight-hater, this is my honest opinion as a mutual person ... the name sounds great, and naming your baby girl after your grandmother sounds like a great idea! If you wanna go with the name, don't let anyone stop you! :)|`|AA11311516	I never read twilight so I wouldnt know, but it sounds like a gorgeous name. Esme..pretty.|`|ErmcT4uUaa	I think a cute name would be Noodles|`|zewYoUM4aa	Yea, it's kinda too much like the book. I think it would be kinda weird for your daughter to grow up and have people constantly ask her if she's named after characters in Twilight. But if you really like the name, then of course you can name her that! Don't worry too much about what people will think if you really like it.|`|v6YcSPVjaa	I have not even read twilight and I know that both of those names are absolutely, positively always compared to the book. But, who cares. No one will know the kid's middle name anyway really. But if you are worried about that try Esme Rosabelle or Esme Rosaline. Maybe just Esme Rose. Good luck though, and Esme Rosalie is beautiful. Good luck!!|`|cIn8BkYHaa	Even though some could ask now if you named her after the book I highly doubt if even in a few years people will still associate her names with the book. It's not like it's a name you haven't heard since the book. If you named your son Frodo Baggins that would be a little different. I say go for it.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	It is your child. You can name it whatever you want to name it. By the time you have your child it may not even be on everyones mind by anymore. I  say if you like the names that is all that matters.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	When your daughter is older, no one is going to remember Twilight, so who cares?|`|2U43CaBBaa	yeahh that would be kinda weird. but a name like rose would be nice. or like violet.|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	Sorry, I don't like Esme at all. But the book series will make it too much if you name your baby that, too.|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	yeah a little too much twilight|`|J1qSW83haa	Yeah it is too twilightish. So maybe just make it Esme Rose. It's still sort of the same but not exactly. Or just Esme or just Rosalie. Just play around with changing the names a bit and see what you get. Hope this helped. Here are a couple if you like.<br>  -Emmy Rose<br>  -Esme Rose<br>  -Rosalie<br>  -Esme<br>  -Emilee Rose<br>  -Rosaliem (sounds like coliseum...)<br>  -Emrose|`|3LI5TtAOaa	It sounds good. It does sound like you are a huge crazy fan of the Twilight series though, naming your girl after two of the characters (even if you don't mean to). I would just use one of those names if I were you.|`|JexYacuAaa	well..<br>  i dont care what these other people are saying.<br>  i think its adorable!<br>  i love the name esme.<br>  i dont think its to twilighty, if you like the name go for it, i think its cute though and would not be weird.|`|MikhcVZfaa	If you ? it, then go for it. Who cares what people think? At least it's not California Holiday or Brooklyn Bridge (yes, I've heard those names before.. lol!)|`|JAinouoUaa	I don't like it sorry!
5BOZ2ryLaa	Although it is unlikely that you would get pregnant a day before your period is due, it IS possible.  You can even get pregnant while you're ON your period.

XHwhhSgaaa	I do well, but honestly I don't spend much time studying or anything. It's not like I'm a freak who goes home and studies all day--waste of time.<br>  Yeah but I hate teachers and stuff. And it's probably even worse for me because I go to Catholic school so you really have to watch out for brainwashing and stuff like that...*sigh*...<br>  I usually fall asleep in class and piss off my teacher all day. After all, I'm tired because I stay up on Yahoo answers!!|`|XYT7jvBdaa	Yes, I do. I study for my exams, do my homework, communicate with my instructors and work hard. School is something that one really cannot afford to be lazy about, because in this economy you need any edge you can get over the competition in the job market. I'm also a psych major, which is quite vigorous work, so I need to care.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Maybe you should pay attention a little more. Not only is this filled with mistakes, it is in the adolescent section of the PARENTING section. This is for people who are parents of adolescents, not for adolescents, Its called common sense, and you seem rather rude. I hate abnoxious teenagers.|`|S3uLASLnaa	Yes i absolutely care about school. I had straight A's in middle school. But freshmen year screwed me up. I didnt care about school and i partied hard and focused on other things. Now sophomore year is almost at its end and  i need to catch up on credits. Because my freshmen year i got advanced classes and i failed them, so im basically a freshmen.|`|cN9sOZfDaa	yeah it's like 50% for each. i care about it cause of what it can do for me after high school, but i don't cause i'm only a kid. [8th grade] <br>  <br>  and yeah, i'm lazy too. not in the athletic kind of way,cause i'm pretty fit, but i'm lazy with homework. it's lame & boring & a waste of paper.|`|Jr9j5f6naa	I'm not a "bad kid", or a true "rebel" or anything, and I'm one of the only ones who answers questions, reads out loud in english, etc. but i also fall asleep, doodle on notes the teachers give us, and argue the teacher's points. I hate school, but I'm good at it. Whatever.|`|EWFtQNSdaa	Yes, I dont want to end up being a janitor for a living.<br>  <br>  No I do not like school, and I could think of a million things I would rather do, but at the end of the day, there is no way I want to be stuck working at a juice bar like I do now.|`|32g6Rmliaa	School's not my favorite, but I try. It is important if you want a job, but some of the stuff is retarded. But I think kids should try in school if they want to be successful, it is one of the most important things in life unfortunately|`|tGGVeW3yaa	I never study for test's or pay attention, because with all the homework they give you you don't need to, cause when you do it you know it so i really don't see the point in learning the same thing 20 times over|`|NjXdkwUiaa	School sets you up for life, if you don't get good GCSEs {Or the american equivalent} then you will get a crap job and eventually die sad and alone at 40 in a ditch. Just a friendly warning.|`|NYJgiVxraa	yeah. i need to get somewhere in life. i find it frustartating and i do slack off sumtimes i gotta admit and im average lol./|`|ST19Eq3baa	Yes- I care about school. I care about my grades and my friends.<br>  <br>  I maintained my grade higher and I don't want to lose those high grades anymore...|`|tFFLXi1Waa	I used to not care. But ever since I started thinking about getting into a good college I'm now trying to work hard in school|`|B2PW3sUKaa	It's obvious you don't care about school. You misspelled bored|`|aDQgLEbuaa	Yes I care about school.  I've worked my butt off.  It's my senior year, I'm not about to stop caring now.|`|GfCjZJbXaa	Quite a lot actually.Grades are important to me.My parents encourage me to do well and I know i have to so I can get a good job and do something with my life.I grew up with my parents always offering to help me with my homework and such.They never pressure me to do something though.If I get a bad grade we review the material and move on.You should try hard even though it stinks now its gonna stink more when your an adult and working at a fast food place|`|5tqh0akYaa	yes, i dont feel like working at taco bell for the rest of my life, and school is going to get me some where.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	I do care. I try and study for tests but alot of the time during lessons in class I just draw random murals on the inside covers of my book. I day dream alot and during boring classes *cough* most classes I get easily distracted and watch the clock tick by. I get good grades and I care but sometimes I lack motivation.|`|JDUi0mbiaa	i only care about the classes that are worth working for and that i like, like my art classes because i want to go to an art college. stupid things like gym i couldnt care less about|`|r39EDGhPaa	I care about school, but I'm super lazy so I don't act like it.<br>  I do well in school but I show up like 2 days out of the week :||`|DWl8nfyWaa	I do.  I want to go to college and get a good job.|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	Well I used to not care about school yet I did study for tests and got good grades.. I was second honor in my class.<br>  Then I moved half way across the world in Asia in where they study SO hard that you won't be able to get by without caring in class.<br>  <br>  So now I'm a 9th grader and I have no choice but to pay attention in class. We have school from 8 to 4:20 and it's just really tough..<br>  I'm still not even the greatest student either. I get lazy too and that doesn't even help a bit.<br>  <br>  It's really tough, so basically.. I'm just trying to work things out.|`|tx2lX6Rfaa	I did a lot in elementary, i still cared in middle, at the beginning of high school somewhat, and junior/senior year i grew apathetic.<br>  I wish i cared more, but hey i'm at UCLA now lol<br>  <br>  and yes I do care about school A LOT.<br>  it's my life.<br>  i want a ph.d|`|IA5zVfk0aa	not when i was in middle school, but then i realized that since its getting harder to get jobs i better start learning.. and its paying off, im graduating this may from college and already and a good job where im gonna be makin $$$$$$ lol its pretty good for a first job.. lol stay in school|`|9hFexadLaa	ya, I have lots of friends there... and there is a lot of hot chicks at my school, but a lot of the stuff we're learning there won't help us at all in life|`|drI1vsJdaa	Yes.

xypA3yZMaa	I was TTC for 2 years on the dot when i found out i was 8 wks pregnant. I didn't know sooner because i had irregular periods all the time. I got pregnant naturally and so can you... take care of yourself and relax! don't stress for a couple of months and don't have "baby sex" have sex because you want it. I wanted a baby since day one of my marriage and omg i stressed and i cried and then finally i relaxed and there you go pregnant! Baby dust to you and soon it will happen.|`|QSodlfMraa	well we was not trying the first time we had sex i became pregnant.<br>  sorry i know what you going through must be hurt on you,<br>  good luck and keep trying.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Hey, <br>  I got pregnant two months after trying, both times. <br>  I went to a natural family planning intro class today with my husband. It was about the Billings Method, with which you chart how your cervical mucus looks and feels every day to understand and track your cycle. It was really really eye-opening.<br>  We are going to use this method to postpone pregnancy for a while, but I think someone like you who has very irregular periods would benefit from this to GET pregnant. You can use this method at any time of your life- when you are breastfeeding, if you have irregular cycles, if you are going through menopause, etc... which is what I love about this! If I get really good at learning how to do it, I can use it for the rest of my life. <br>  <br>   I found the instructor from this site: www.omsoul.com. They have a directory where you can find an instructor close to you. The one we found is really nice and offered to set up a payment plan. The class and chart reviews total $145 for a whole year, so that's not too bad. <br>  Someone from Y!A actually gave me that site name lol... so I thought I'd pass it along. Good luck!!! I really hope you get pregnant soon :)|`|VxKH7KHmaa	We started trying in the beginning of October and were pregnant by the end of October with lots of good old fashion sex & ovulation calendar.|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	it took us 2 weeks to get preg ...good luck|`|S4pNsW3Taa	We tryed for 1 month to get pregnant and I got pregnant in that month|`|ZgBdeZnvaa	I had a miscarriage first it took me year later before I got pregnant with my son it was almost a one year and half later before I got pregnant with my daughter.

Mine were like yours and birth control got them regular. It could work for you too. You can get it at your local health clinic. Hope this help, GOOD LUCK.
ded7fdac4b59b508c4c35606747c7633aa	You sound just like I did the other week! My daughter is 15mos and got it for the first time. Its gone away. Get a cool air humdifier for her room. I would try and stop worrying, maybe get rid of the video moniter! I returned mine after I realized how paranoid it was making me. The steroids will prevent her throat from swelling shut so you don't need to be so scared, she will be fine. If you live near somewhere cold take her for a short walk outside everyday to breath fresh cold air as well. I would do that and then take her into the bathroom and steam it up. It seemed to work really well. <br>  Now if only I could stop coughing!!! I think she might have given it to me know!|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Home treatment usually is all that is needed to treat croup. You can help prevent major episodes, or attacks, as well as use techniques to manage attacks if they occur.<br>  <br>  Wash your hands often and stay away from others to help prevent spreading croup. Keep your child home from day care or school if he or she has croup.<br>  <br>  Preventing croup attacks...<br>  You may be able to prevent croup episodes, or attacks, of intense troubled breathing and coughing. If your child has croup:<br>  <br>  Offer plenty of fluids to drink. Always have water available and try offering other beverages, frozen ice treats (such as Popsicles), or crushed ice drinks several times each hour. <br>  Do not smoke, especially in the house. <br>  Consider using a humidifier in your child's room. Do not use a hot vaporizer, and make sure you put only plain water in the humidifier. Although research has not consistently shown that croup symptoms improve with humidifier use, using one poses very little risk.1 To prevent mold growth, be sure to empty, clean, and completely dry out the humidifier between each use. <br>  Over-the-counter cold medicines, such as antihistamines and decongestants, are not helpful for treating croup. Check with the doctor before giving these medicines to your child. Experts say not to give decongestants to children younger than 2. <br>  <br>  Managing attacks of croup....<br>  <br>  It is important for you and your child to keep calm during an attack of croup, even though it can be frightening. If your child is upset, crying, and anxious, the swelling and narrowing of the airway can become worse. Usually, symptoms sound worse than they are.<br>  <br>  Taking measures to manage an episode of croup, such as adding moisture to the air and keeping your child calm and comfortable, can help keep symptoms under control. If coughing and difficulty breathing do not improve within about 30 minutes despite your efforts, call or see your child's doctor. Because attacks often occur in the middle of the night, you may need to visit a hospital emergency room.|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	When my daughter was having breathing problems my husband and I propped her up in bed between us so we could listen to every little sound she made. Since she doesn't like to sleep in your bed, maybe you can sleep in her room. Recently, my other daughter had the stomach flu and wouldn't sleep anywhere but her crib so I just camped out on the floor of her room next to her crib. This way you can at least doze with the knowledge that you are close by to help her when she needs it. Good luck!|`|AA11256693	First off, no cold air. Warm moist air only.<br>  <br>  If it were me, she'd be in my bed, probably proped up on my chest, so that I could doze but still watch over her.|`|e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	First, you are right about the cool air.  It has something to do with the vocal cords being swollen (hence the barking)  In adults the same virus ends up as laryngitis.  If she won't sleep with you then I'd make a bed on her floor.  You aren't going to sleep well anyway, right?  <br>  <br>  If she can't sleep try taking her for a ride in the car with her dressed warmly but the window slightly down for the cool air.  She'll be sitting upright and probably fall asleep.  <br>  <br>  If her lips start turning blue, don't panic, but go ahead and take her into the hospital.  She needs the oxygen whether it is given directly or another treatment to open airways.  Plus the hospital is pretty quiet at night.<br>  <br>  Stay calm, you're doing a good job.  Just be glad Evan is still inside and you don't have two croupy kids :)|`|clNss9sEaa	My 20 month old has had croup and now has RSV, it is terrible to go through, expecially at night.  It helps him having a humidifier next to bed, plus the doctors told me to put a couple bowls of water on the floor by the heating registers to help circulate the room and get rid of the dry air.  It does work taking him into the bathroom and turning on the hot water water of the shower, it clears him up and it helps get everything else up in him lungs.  I was so paranoid of him sleeping I slept on the floor next to his bed for 2 nights just so I could hear everything.  If it is still bad by morning you should call her doctor, maybe she will need liquid albuetrol or rondec dm.  Those are 2 things he needed plus another steroid.  Good Luck to you. I hope she gets better soon. :-)|`|ENANtueuaa	I had croup when i was 2, my parents said it's pretty serious. My dad said he stayed up all night and rocked me cuz he was afraid to put me down! I do that with my own daughter. She's never had croup, but when she's that sick, i definately let her sleep with me. I want to be there in case anything happens. Did they give you antibiotics for ti. The tylonel/motrin is only keeping the fever under control, but it's not helping the cause, which is croup. I know you said she is finiky about where she sleeps, but if you have a rocker in her room, maybe you could sleep in that, or just sleep on the floor. Hope this helps!
k3AmV6waaa	He is a bad father and husband, that is why you guys are not together any more. However, if you know this, you should be on the pill and stop having kids with him.|`|lzivF4Idaa	go to court and file for child support.<br>  <br>  ive been through this, my ex will go get things SOMETIMES when i need them after me continuing to call and nag and call and nag. since our son has been born he's only given me 250$ and he's 6 months old. in total other than that he's spent about 100$ on him. most forcefully and the rest was a lame attempt at a xmas gift. i have a child support court date for the 10th.|`|711KONwOaa	im sorry <br>  but ask your daughter to ask her dad to get her they stuff she needs <br>  or ask him for money.<br>  i hope that made sience<br>  please do my questions please|`|VuUz8NgKaa	You need to file for child support.|`|q0DntFi1aa	he is too young to understand the responsibility of being a dad.  Try not to have anymore kids with him.  Give him space to grow up and find yourself a job.  Go to school for yourself so you can support your kids.  Once you done, he will be the last thing on your mind because you know he is a looser.  Do you girl, do not waste any breath on that man.  What ever he gives you, take some and save some.  If you take him to child support, how much money you think they will give you?  You will agravate you life.  Start taking care of yourself and your baby to come.  This man is a looser.  If he is not man enough to take care of his family, why do you want him in your life?  You need a man not a sperm donor.  Take care of your family, cause you sound like your are the mom and the dad.  Good luck!

Ashleigh becasue ppl will naturally spell it Ashley and then everything will be confusing|`|EIgmm8ilaa	Carly, yes. Adorable.|`|XzV4bUeFaa	I never met a Karlee.  It's a unique spelling and the school should have corrected their records once advised.

I love the spelling Karlee.<br>  <br>  Most people are used to: Karly/Carly, but I think that's boring.<br>  If I named my daughter 'Karly', I'd spell it either;<br>  Karlee or Carleigh. <br>  <br>  :)|`|ehBPus3Zaa	Yes, but they spelled it KARLYE.<br>  <br>  She was my niece by marriage.|`|a7dfc0734afad881cd453d93635d1a3aaa	Dude 'Karlee' is so pretty. Just like it. Okay. I have seen it:<br>  Karli<br>  Carly<br>  Kahrlee<br>  ^ that last one's probably worse than yours.<br>  also Carlye which is kinda weird.

gvLjbVFJaa	It's not safe. It even says so on the tag, if you look. It's in capital letters with a bunch slash through it. <br>  <br>  Try putting in between some sleep positioners like these: <br>  <a href="http://www.summerinfant.com/categories_view.php?id=54" rel="nofollow">http://www.summerinfant.com/categories_v...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mykids2.com/inslpo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mykids2.com/inslpo.html</a><br>  <br>  They aren't that expensive $10 - $30 and the vary from simple, to wedges, to ones that include a full pad and play a heartbeat sound. They can be found pretty much anywhere. I've seen them at Target, K-Mart, Wal-Mart and Toys R Us.<br>  <br>  I suspect she looks the close feeling, so try swaddling her and putting her in between these, it will be much safer for her in the long run.|`|EyKJ737daa	I would say no. although I have never heard of these "boppy pillows", any pillow should not be used for sleeping children until after the age of 12 months.  Even during the day I wouldn't use a pillow of any kind as things can happen so quickly and if you are watching her, all it takes is a few moments to answer the phone and be absorbed in something else.  Please don't do it sweetie, it's really not worth the risk.  My 17 month old still doesn't use a pillow and my older 2, aged 5 and 3 often still throw their pillows onto the floor during the night!  All the best and congratulations on the safe arrival of your little girl.  You're doing a great job already sweetie :-) xx|`|oem5yEUDaa	How old is she? You need to stop this before it becomes too much of a habit. What happens when she is too big for it? The longer you let her do it the harder it will be to break it later.<br>  <br>  My daughter always slept in her bassinet for the first two weeks, then she would only fall asleep in her bouncer. I would move her to her cot after she had fallen asleep. Eventually she got the idea and now she won't sleep anywhere else.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i put my baby to sleep on his tummy and he is fine, it was the only way he would sleep.<br>  about 5 yrs ago the doctor/midwife all put babies on their tummy to sleep, now they say to put them on their back and i bet in a few more yrs it will be back to sleeping on ur tummys again. it changes all the time.<br>  do wat feels right for u and ur baby|`|1SGl03Zlaa	It will increase the chances of SIDS.  The Boppy pillow is thick and does not allow good air flow which can cause SIDS.  It is safest for babies to sleep flat on their backs, even allowing them to sleep in a car seat or swing is not recommended because it increases the risk of SIDS.|`|24f969b02a5ea25351be932405126b28aa	no it isn't safe, she can smother herself. if she wpnt sleep any other way let her fall asleep in it with you right there by her and then move her to her bed. you really want to break this habit now why she is young because other wise you are going to have a hard time getting her to sleep in a bed.|`|xV3e72e1aa	It's probably safe.  However, there is a chance she could slip down and suffocate.  However rare, it's still extremely scary, so I wouldn't let her sleep in it unless you are right there keeping a close eye on her.|`|kgSBcnRaaa	My son was the same way, he hated to sleep flat.  I let him sleep in the boppy but I checked him all the time.  You are not suppose to use it.  Get a high incline wedge to have your baby sleep in that is what I ended up doing.|`|46ijdaH6aa	It's okay if she sleeps in the Boppy but I would lay her on her back, laying on her stomach is not always safe. Depending on age, I could answer this question better.|`|AA11256693	Not safe.<br>  Babies should not sleep with pillows or blankets of any kind.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	no... the boppy has a BIG TAG that says NO SLEEP!|`|SDjrojZXaa	honestly no...they put it right on the warning label because they dont have strong neck muscles if she turns her head the wrong way she could smother herself.....i dont see anything wrong with a nap if you are around but i wouldnt suggest it at night....maybe try a bouncy chair if she likes the angle. good luck.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I wouldnt reccomend it to anyone and there is a huge tag on it that says "sleep" with a big red line through it. A pillow of any kind increases the risk of sids and is a suffocation hazard. That said, I can raise my hand sheepishly and say that for the first few weeks my daughter slept in my bed, in her boppy pillow. She is fine and sleeps on her back in her cradle now (she is 3 months) but dont let others success stories fool you. Awful things do happen and I would always suggest BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY!!! Good luck!

FwN2Htoraa	My son sued to get up about 5am every morning. You may try give him more solid food than milk. I hope will help.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	possibly a later bedtime? not letting him get overstimulated or over tired? that's all i can think of....|`|pXSKSS3daa	Unfortunately(for you) this may just be the time he's ready to wake up. 5 AM is morning, so be thankful for that much. Some babies, like clockwork, wake at the same time every morning.<br>  <br>  Have you tried pushing his bedtime back? Of course this is only if he allows(isn't too tired or fussy). When are you feeding him last before putting him down? Our son eats about 45 minutes before we put him down for bed(5 oz. of formula with a bowl of applesauce) and he sleeps through the night until 8-10 AM. However, he's also almost 11 months old.|`|AA11355939	Get over it!  Welcome to parenthood!  In time he will adjust his schedule.  Be glad he sleeps that late.  Other than slowly trying to keep him up a little later in the evening so that his sleeping schedule will gradually shift a bit there is nothing you can do.  <br>  <br>  Somewhere around two years of age he will probably go through another fit of waking during the night and staying awake for awhile.  You must learn to make adjustments also because he cannot be reasoned with at this point.  You might also try reducing his naps during the day so that he needs more sleep at night.  Just try not to make any sudden changes in his schedule or both of you will be miserable.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless you.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	My son is almost a 1 and wakes up at 7 am no matter what time we put him to bed. Unfortunately all babies are different and some need less sleep than others. What we sometimes do with my son IS put toys in his crib so when he wakes up, he'll play a little bit and doesn't need to be pulled out off his crab right away.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	The only way to make him sleep later is to put him to bed later. My son usually goes to bed when we go to sleep. He is our only one though. He normally will fall asleep himslef around 9:30 or 10. Then we actually give him a bottle whenever we go to bed and he sleeps until about 8:30 the next morning. Good Luck|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	What time are you putting him to bed at night?|`|8P0XFwoGaa	There are a couple of ways it has worked for me.<br>  <br>  1) If there are less naps during the day and you keep him up a little bit later than he will tire out and stay asleep a lot longer.<br>  <br>  2) You could try a sound machine or a lullaby tape on a low tone.<br>  <br>  3) Children naturally fall asleep easier when they are in a warmer environment, so you could put a heated bean-heating pad in with the baby when this occurs.<br>  <br>  4) There are pillows made specifically for children that make sounds like heart beats etc. to make the child feel more comfortable, they fall asleep easier that way<br>  <br>  <br>  It's just a fact of having a baby, It'll get better though!|`|46ijdaH6aa	I would NOT recommend anythign that has the sound of a heartbeat. I have heard if they hear that while newbors they can think their still in the womb and stop breathing, cause naturally they were not breathing air while inside the womb  ... <br>  <br>  I would recommend putting the baby to bed LATER than normal .. Just play some games, rather he is cranky or not.
eDmdkUO3aa	I lost my mucus plug slowly, it took 3 days actually. It was clear the first two days, once it had a yellow look to it. And the third day it was tinged with blood. I went into labor the day after it had the blood in it. I was 38 1/2 weeks when this started and had baby at 39 weeks according to the doctor's due date. I, however know when we conceived the baby and he was actually two weeks early, not one. So, however you want to take that.|`|AA10015577	1.  When I first lost a piece of it I was around 30 weeks and it was just clear/opaque looking snot.  I had also lost more clear mucous sometime after that as well.  I lost bloody show (blood tinged mucous plug) at 41 weeks, 2 days and I went into labor that night and had my son at 2:24 a.m.<br>  <br>  2.  I answered this question in the first question.<br>  <br>  3.  I think I answered all the questions in the first question!<br>  <br>  HTH!|`|5f6XnInEaa	1. I started losing mine at about 35 weeks.<br>  <br>  2. I still made it to 38 weeks, although it was a close call at 35 weeks!<br>  <br>  3. It really looked like (and this is going to sound pretty gross) but if you have ever coughed up that dark yellow phlegm when you've had a cold, that's what it looked like to me!|`|C6oTOvOMaa	When i was pregnant with my first daughter I lost my mucus plug in the toilet at 38 weeks. It looked like a big ball of goober with a tiny tiny bit of pink in it. I gave birth to her exactly 1 week after that at 39 weeks...<br>  <br>  With this pregnancy as u already know im 37w4d I am experiencing this now. On friday when i wiped after using the restroom a big piece of it came out, it looked like a big glob of snot that was very stringy and stretchy like, it was clearish/yellow tinged no blood. I thought that was all of it until yesterday I kept losing it all in big pieces throughout the entire day and night, everytime i went to wipe there would be more and lots of it. Today I have noticed a little but i think it is pretty much all out. And since losing it i have been having some painful contractions..Keep in mind not all women notice it come out,I never noticed it when i was pregnant with my son until in the delivery room before my water broke. some women will have it come out in one giant glob and some will have it come out in tiny pieces for days or even weeks. Also when your doctor checks u sometimes when he withdraws his fingers from your cervix u will see the mucus plug actually come out with his hand which is completely normal. It may or may not be tinged with blood and u will definitely know if u lose it, like i said before think of when u blow your nose or spit out some chest congestion mucus, that is pretty much exactly what it looks like...Good Luck and hope u have progressed tomorrow =o)|`|01vMpHkWaa	1. lost it at 37 weeks the day after i got my cervix checked and then again on saturday after walking around all day<br>  <br>  2. im still pregnant but been having lots of braxton hicks and back aches<br>  <br>  3.it looked like a white booger..or a white snail. i found it after i wiped to use the bathroom and felt very slimy so i looked and saw this long booger lol i was like ok thats strange....?
eDmdkUO3aa	If you are wiping and there is mucus, you are loosing it. Some loose it slowly, over the course of a few days or they loose it in one big clump. I am not sure if they doctors can tell or not. They will be able to tell you what % you are effaced that is another important part of getting ready for labor.|`|01vMpHkWaa	uhm i dont think so..well idk<br>  <br>  i told my doctor that i lost it so she didnt have to tell me|`|KihffCc5aa	Sometimes.  But, you can also lose your mucus plug several days before you go into labor.  No one talks about it in the books, it's really a disgusting thing.  It's not a lot of thick discharge, it's a handful of REALLY THICK mucus, that is often brown and blood tinged.  AND, it's THICK and A LOT!<br>  <br>  At the end of pregnancy, your body will discharge a lot of stuff, including thick mucus.  But the Mucus Plug is disgusting, and you KNOW when it happens, but that also doesn't mean a trigger for labor.<br>  <br>  Colleen
f59c7c70e6dd2cd48c08f7ac5aec140aaa	Ugh!  I'm was going through the same thing.  My boy is 6 months and is up every 2 hours like he was a new born.  My fiance works nights too so it's just me and our two-year-old and our six-month-old, so I'm tired too.  When he did sleep it' was because he ate a good amount of rice cereal mixed with fruit or veggies and formula.  Most of the time he didn't take it, which were the nights he didn't sleep.  I recently did some research online and found out that the mixture of cereal/fruit/formula was too thick for him.  Make it very watery and put it toward the back of his mouth.  He'll swallow it all down.  Also, though, my first son went through the same thing about that time when he was going through a growth spurt.  Again, also, make sure you're not doing anything to wake your son up more than necessary.  When he wakes up, don't turn on lights or the tv, just make the bottle and lay down with him in the dark (I have the light on over the stove all the time, so it's not moving around in complete darkness or BAM! light!), don't talk or soothe him.  Just feed him.  If he needs a diaper change, do it before you feed him (no matter how loud the screams are), so he can relax, eat and fall into sleep again.<br>  (after reading your follow-up)  The more that's going on when my son wakes up, the worse.  If he would wake up and there's an older sibling and my other in the same room, I'm sure they would move around, which would stimulate the baby.  When my son wakes in the middle of the night, I take him (and his car seat - yes, he sleeps in his car seat - it rocks like a rocking chair!) into the living room and me and him lay on the couch and I feed him.  He'll fall asleep and I'll move him 2 feet into his car seat.  If necessary I'll rock his carseat.  No movement from me or anyone else.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	My son is 7 months and has not slept through the night since he was 2 weeks old.  He wakes every 30 minutes to 3 hours and on RARE occasion goes 4 hours.  I've tried everything and I've just accepted that that is the way he is and I just have to deal with it.  And yes, EVERYONE else's baby sleeps through the nght or at least longer than yours does.  I bet half of them are lying. lol.  Sometimes he wakes up because he has gas (usually), he's hungry, he's also teething, or a noise woke him up.  Every little noise wakes him.  What can you do?|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	The way we have our sleeping arrangement is with our son's crib "side-carred" to our bed. If you are really wanting to co-sleep, this might be an option. We followed the instructions given by another co-sleeping family, who has a website with pictures and detailed info. on how to make the arrangement work. We have been doing this since we brought our son home from the hospital and he is now 9 months. He is a great sleeper, and I think it helps to know we are right there in the morning. <br>  <br>  Here is the site if you are interested:<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/sidecarcrib/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/sidecarcrib/inde...</a><br>  <br>  This may help him to sleep through the night, and it would give you all the space you need. <br>  <br>  Best of luck with whatever you choose to do, take care!|`|TJezsCkHaa	Put him in a separate room and make sure that he is well fed,clean,wearing comfy pajamas and nothing in bed that might wrap around his face like blanket or pillow.Then walk out the door and never get back in there until you hear no voice.Go back sneaky and check his breathing and make sure he is well rested then cover him with a blanket and go rest.This well take time-about a week or so-but it works.You will feel so bad but for your own sake and your own health and his as well.It worked with all my 3 kids.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	I feel your pain!  My daughter is 17 months and hasn't slept through the night once:(|`|AFi5kTiEaa	My son, my first was and is the best sleeper ever, it was so nice!  My second, a girl was totally different.  Just like your baby.  always woke up several times a night..uuugggh.  I made some mistakes with her.  She was a good napper and napped to much during the day which made her night sleeping awful.  I would also give her a bottle during the night to get her to fall asleep, also a mistake.  What i did was change her naps.  Shorter and earlier.  Limit the naps to 1-1.5 hours and make them earlier in the day.  I stopped giving a bottle at night, she would wake and expect it, if you dont offer one they will get used of not having it and may not wake for it.  It took some time but it worked.  She still woke up but only once or twice some nights but went right back to sleep.  The first time she slept through the night i wanted to throw a party!<br>  <br>  I also have a thyroid condition, but hypo.  Have you seen an endocronologist?  If not i suggest you do.  When I got on the right dose of medicine, I was a new person and i feel great now.  Having a thyroid condition is sooooo awful if you arent on the right medicine.  I could barely function before.  Take care of yourself, your children need a healthy mommy.|`|VxKH7KHmaa	Your baby is past the newborn stage being 7 months. The average 7 month old is not expected to sleep entirely through the night, but may wake only 1-2 times. Take all factors into consideration...comfort, lighting, sound, texture of the bedding or pygamas. Anything that could be causing your baby enough discomfort to wake frequently. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are running into the room everytime he wakes, to give him something...(he has you well trained). I strongly suggest letting him try to self-sooth and trust that he will fall back asleep despite the crying. You really have to ask yourself this question when he wakes up and cries... "Does he really NEED something?" or does he just WANT something? <br>  <br>  Take care and good luck.|`|QzgkN2LZaa	yeah let the baby sleep with you!!! it may be hard to break the habbit later but you need to watch your health too|`|AA11113545	same with mine. i eventually just had them sleep with me so I was able to get sleep|`|AOvtRBU9aa	yes amanda is right. I have my daughter sleep with us and we will probably pay for it later but I do enjoy my sleep though. LOL!
jDmXXz3xaa	ITS CALLED WOMANIZER BY BRITNEY SPEARS
2zC1lpfVaa	Depend of what do you mean by "cant have babys", and the reason for not being able to have babies.<br>  <br>  For most of the women here that are trying to have a baby, we do have periods and "everything normal".  some just have some fertility concerns.|`|KlKomVgPaa	For my case i have my period every month but i still cant conceive . The only thing that i have a longer one like 8 to 14 days but some months its 4 to 6 days and this because I have PCOS
e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	I suggest doing what I had to do when a little girl brought a case to my daycare and got an infestation.  I put my child's head on my lap and while she watched a movie I used a flashlight and tweezers.  <br>  <br>  I hated it, but rather than complaining or making her feel dirty for something she had no control over I turned it into an opportunity to show her how much I loved her and got to brush her hair for her since she was usually going 90 mph and had no time for mom to fuss with her hair.  It's a nurturing thing to do.<br>  EDIT:<br>  Ha!  I ended up doing six.  The other girls' moms worked and had no time.  The blondes were the worst.  It's harder to see.  The flashlight helped.  I even got a louse off one of the kids.  If you do a thorough job you won't have trouble three weeks later.  Happy hunting.|`|INH8asKVaa	Nits are a pain.<br>  Washes everything vacuum everything.<br>  Even wash lounges.<br>  Yes you will have to comb these out.<br>  I suggest repeating it every 5 days for about 3 weeks.<br>  Nits have a nasty habbit of regrouping.<br>  And make sure you wash any stuffed animals of your daughters who may respread it.|`|zQ2m2rkXaa	you need to get every single one out!!!! it's horrible, i know. and then you're supposed to do it again in a couple of days...... don't skip that! keep doing it every couple of days until you know for sure that they're all out!|`|5633e8191b884e0bdc24b085089f5122aa	I defer to the answers above, but just wanted to add that you should also wash pillow, couch covers, and her car seat cover.  The car seat is often forgotten and if she is in it often, it is important to remember.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Yes, you need to get them all out, just incase one isn't dead. This will seem odd, but soak your daughter's hair in vinegar. Vinegar looses the 'glue' that holds the nits to the hair dtrand making it easier to get them out. I reallr fine comb is best.

pp9RzHvDaa	How long have you been taking it?  Anti-depressants can be a little strange.  It's like trial and error.  Keep experimenting until you find the one that works.  I would say if you've been taking it for 4-6 weeks and have seen no improvement in your depression, call your doctor.  I had a horrible experience with Prozac.  It had an adverse effect on me.  So I know how frustrating it is!|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	This might sound dumb, but I've just been reading about depression being treated by including sea weed in the diet. I don't know if it works for post natal depression, but it's something to consider...|`|NSMV0XCEaa	I had my son almost 8 months ago, and I experienced Postpartum depression and My doctor put me on Celexa. It helps but I actually still sufer from it. My medicine helps with the Depression but not anxiety.|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Zoloft worked really well for me.  I wasn't suffering from anxiety, just postpartum depression.  I honestly can say that Zoloft saved my life.  Postpartum depression such a hard thing to get through, but you can do it.  Medication helped me so much, but it took a couple of weeks to really start helping.  If you've been taking it more than 3 weeks talk to your doctor.  While some anti depressants work for some people, they don't for others.  I was lucky that the first one prescribed to me worked.

If you are all at the table having a discussion and you add to it and the stepson says, "I was talking to my Mom."  Then your wife needs to say, "Son, we are all at the dinner table together having a family discussion, you do not need to talk to your stepfather with that attitude, and it isn't polite to insist that he NOT be part of the discussion."<br>  <br>  If she doesn't stand up for you, then you can forget it.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	could be something that his biological dad is saying to him...his MOTHER needs to inject herself and tell him(lee) to give you a fricking break!!!!!<br>  you sound like a good man because you are trying to educate yourself with reading books.

Mom needs to bridge the relationship and teach him respect. How would he feel if you spoke to him in the manner he is speaking to you?<br>  What's Mom thinking?  Does Mom feel you don't really care about the child so she's allowing his behavior?|`|RYDFHGVgaa	My guess is that he has not adapted to you yet. If you play with him more and talk with him than. Figure out his interests his favorite sports team try and get to know him.|`|pB1oXLz5aa	I'd get tough with him. I wouldn't allow him to speak to you in a disrespectful manner for one and for two I wouldn't stop talking to him. if he doesn't like it then tough. Either he'll get used to it or he'll get used to it, there can't be options. If you give a kid too many options your basically saying "how would you like to be raised today, no punishment for piss poor decisions.... dandy" you and your wife neeeeeeeeddd to be on the same damn page man. all kids but especially kids that have been through something like a divorce need structure, not a buddy. don't even try to settle for this friend crap. be his dad.|`|oR3v2IUmaa	His mom needs to have a conversation with him about this!!  You should be respected no matter what and you are not being.  You might try having a boys day out.  Even a one on one day with the 7yr old.  He might open up to you if you both are having fun.
GcSEIIzFaa	Family Counseling... it's hard for a family sometimes to look objectively at their own situations. An outsider looking in--particularly one with a degree in psychology--will find it way easier to understand what's happening or what's missing in the relationship and advise you accordingly.<br>  <br>  It's really important that you have a good relationship with him, as I'm sure you know, especially since you have another baby on the way. You want to start everything out on the right foot.<br>  <br>  I'd seriously consider a family counselor... they are pricey, yes, but they do loads of good. Ask around, do some research, find a good one so you know you're getting your money's worth, and then give it a shot... trying something on your own knowledge might just make you both frustrated and unwilling to keep trying. <br>  <br>  Good luck, sincerely.<br>  <br>  PS: Whatever fears or nervousness you feel about seeing a professional, trust me, it will be worth it... there's no shame in getting help about family issues. Millions of families would have turned out a lot differently if they'd had a little guidance from the git-go.|`|3c8GsRvUaa	just keep trying don't give up other wise he will think your just going to leave him alone. even if he says stop talking to him cause my guess is his not use to you.just make time to get use to him .|`|62fa2d0c6e8de6507e574cf4131634dfaa	I honestly think that all of you need family counseling ...go ASAP, especially with a new baby coming so soon.

He'll see you as a parental figure when you can punish him for doing things. I'm not saying that you should punish him for not talking to you. But I am saying that when he does something bad, you should punish him, instead of mom. <br>  <br>  On the connecting aspect, I'd give it time. Ask him direct questions; you can't really ignore those. If he says "don't talk to me," tell him he's being rude. He probably won't like you at first, but you need respect, from what it sounds like. "Liking" you can come later.
n0nT5rTCaa	There's nothing you can do to stop it. But you can buy little pads that stick on your nips to soak it up so you don't show through your clothes.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	well yea your breasts are going to leak, you just gave birth, it will stop after a while since your not breastfeeding|`|80zoY5OYaa	i just had a baby 5weeks ago. i tell you how to do it. take cabbage leaves and on your breast,make sure you put them over you nipples. then put you 2 bras on, then take a ace bandage and wrap your breast up tight. i promise you it will work. i had to do it. do it before you get knots and fever.
8yTP3jO8aa	I agree that you probably don't want to hand him over a house key.  Toys are so easily lost in public, and that's one extra chance you might not want to take.<br>  <br>  If you decide to do this, I strongly suggest that you reserve them for quiet sitting time and not for actual physical playing time.  Keys are pretty sharp and can puncture skin pretty well, so they are kind of dangerous.  <br>  <br>  Keys also can get super dirty, so if you routinely hand them over to help with fussing in public, I suggest washing them off with hot soapy water every couple of days.<br>  <br>  You could look at getting the funky printed keys, which could make them a bit more fun for your 2 year old.  <br>  <br>  Another idea that might work for your 2 year old is to get a cheap photo key chain and put pictures on it of things he's interested in.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I would just be concerned if he dropped it, you'd need to change your locks. :P  I used to work at a kiosk in a mall, and you wouldn't believe how many baby shoes, socks, and rattles we picked up off the floor at the end of the night.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Just last year there way a young boy around that age who was playing with a set of keys when he fell onto them and they got embedded in to his eye.

Sorry.|`|axwdwiSuaa	brilliant, i've never done it but i think it's very smart of you to think of this.|`|AA12398373	I have worked in the security business for almost 40 years, and I think it is an ill-advised idea.<br>  <br>  Furthermore as a parent, and a grandparent, I think it presents a choking safety hazard for the child.<br>  <br>  I urge you to take responsibility for your own house keys. A 2 1/2 year old is far too young for that.|`|NmsBFeNJaa	I don't think this is a good idea for such a young child. They could easily lose the keys and they are not a safe toy for a 2 year old. Perhaps you should give a spare key to Grandma and Grandpa when they are watching your son. A key is a good idea for a child who knows the responsibility that it bears, but not for one so small.|`|uFT0k30Kaa	I wouldn't give metal to child. I have defended myself before with a key, so they can be sharp. If you do, I would also have it on a large key ring that can't be removed easliy to avoid a choking hazard. What happens if the keys get lost? Would you feel comfortable with your house key floating around?|`|NJ9Ytksraa	My friend did it recently and the boy lost it. I wouldn't do it because since he lost in, somebody broke into their house. I'm not saying this is because of the key, but I am very suspicious because the door was locked, and not a window or anything was scratched. <br>  Wait a little longer|`|4fBXhYqSaa	i hate people like you that like us to waste are time reading your joking questions, just so you can see waht kind of lame answers we come up with like were u expecting<br>  "are you stupid, what if the kid loses it"<br>  "are you stupid... what up with the skeleton"<br>  "Are you stupid..

46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I do not think this requires a trip to the ER. Blood pressure is one of those things that go up, and then go down. One minute you can have a bad bp reading, and then a couple of minutes later have a good one. While you are up and moving and doing things, your bp is elevated. Once you sit and relax it usually goes down. Your doctor will keep a closer eye on you, because of the bp issues. Just listen to the instructions that your doctor gives you, and Im sure you'll be fine. Just sit and relax, and try not to stress that's the best thing you can do for you and your baby. Ive had bp issues with all 3 of my babies, and Ive gotten a lot of information about the condition. I hope this has been helpful.|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	If you feel like you need to go, then go. No one can judge how you are feeling except for you. Maybe you should give your midwife a call and ask for her opinion. If it was me, I would probably go, just to be safe. And tell your mom she's stressing you out making your BP worse, sheesh!|`|2jiNLOKHaa	go to the er|`|N4nYw5B8aa	If you feel weird or "crappy", go to the ER.

YOU just have her spoiled rotten, you see, my son did the same thing, and your baby knows that if she wakes up you WILL hold  her, she is only 6 weeks old and already has you wrapped around her little finger, welcome to motherhood, sit back and enjoy the ride,  because it can be so rewarding and fun, and you will have challanges to come, <br>  congrats mommy, <br>  I think your a really good new Mother|`|hmcQJnTraa	this would happen to me all the time. my daughter is almost six months and still does it <br>  lol.<br>  i just pick her back up if i want peace of mind but if i have time through out the day to train her i will put her to sleep in my arms.. (please note that it usually takes a baby about 30 mins to fall into a deep sleep)...so just because she looks like shes sleeping dont assume shes knocked out. i usually know with my daughter because her hands will be loose.. then i would get a blanket and either put it in the dryer or microwave.. for a couple seconds (if in microwave) and then softly swaddle her in it. and then put her in her basinet but while i was putting her in her bassinet i would keep my chest on her. so i would lean as far down as i could before i seperated her from me.<br>  good luck. <br>  please dont try the crying it out method... shes too small..<br>  and for those who say she is spoiled. i have to dissaggree.<br>  when i told my doc my daughter did that at the post partum check up and i mentioned the crying it out method she told me not to do it. she said you cant spoil your baby with love. right now is the perfect time to just hold her. all of a sudden shes in this big world and she doesnt know whats going on. your all she really knows. letting her cry it out will make her think she cant count on you.|`|m3cf7vsAaa	She is used to being all snuggled up and when you lay her down, she feels less secure.

byXx3o1oaa	First of all i suggest that you find out if you're pregnant or not. If the test comes back positive then you and your boyfriend first need to tell your parents that you're a couple and then you need to set both yours and his parents down and tell them. Its expected that they'll be upset and disappointed for a while but things will calm down once they've had time to get used to the idea. Its important your parents know so you can discuss your options together and they are good to have for support as well. In their eyes you may have made a mistake by not waiting until marriage but the baby isn't a mistake. Congrats if you are expecting! and good luck|`|5tqh0akYaa	make sure if your pregnant or not. And if you are tell them ' i messed up and your going to be disappointed but i just need support right now, im pregnant and im keeping the baby (if you are)'|`|p25p9jTYaa	im with Jessica.|`|XbzgPJ9Gaa	Well find out if you are pregnant first, because that will eliminate some stress.  You might not be, and be getting all worked up over nothing.<br>  I think it's very responsible that your boyfriend wants to be there when you tell them.  I think most parent's would respect that because it show's he is being responsible.  If your parent's don't even know you're dating, then it should make it look better because he is present.  <br>  Discuss with your boyfriend how things are going to work.  How you both will work hard to take care of the baby, what you will do for schooling, etc.  This helps show responsibility.  I know when me and my b/f at the time told our families we were expecting, they were a lot more receptive because we had a plan.<br>  There is no way to "lessen the blow."  All you can do is say straight up "I'm pregnant."  I think it is best to not beat around the bush, but to go straight to the point.  Yah, they might be disappointed, but they will get over it.  We were so worried when we told our families--we were pretty sure we'd be out.  The best advice we received was: "Things are totally different when a baby is involved."  && it's so true.  ...my Mom admitted later, that as soon as I told her, she was more excited than anything.  :)<br>  Good luck.  <br>  && eventhough you might not want to hear it right now (I know I didn't at first...)  CONGRATULATIONS.  :)|`|tGGVeW3yaa	it's a good idea for your bf to be there, and there really is no right or wrong way to tell them you just have to bite the bullet and tell them the best way you know how, the main thing is they have a right to know either way no matter what way you think they'll react|`|i3pn4jNcaa	well you need to find out 100% if you are preg or not first. you dont wanna go thru all that hastle tellin your parents and then getting your period the next day you know? go to a free clinic an get a pregnancy test. it is a good idea for your boyfriend to be there. theyre gonna have to meet him sooner or later.|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	your 17<br>  it's your business|`|rU6gvHFkaa	The first thing is not to get down on yourself chances are you are not pregnant. If you are stay as calm as you can your parents will always love you no matter what happens. If you are, try and take your mom to the park or somewhere that you like and tell her that you have something to tell her and you would like for her to stay calm. She will be shocked like any parents but she will always be there for you no matter what happens. Plus moms love babies. Then you will have your mom there to help you tell your dad and to help calm him down. In the end everything will be ok. But make sure that you are pregnant before you do anything.  As for the bf being there I don't think it would be the best idea. You could always say that its with a guy you have been dating for awhile and that you would love for them to meet later. Don't over shock them by bring him along. But, you know how your parents are so do what you think is best. Just remember stuff happens for a reason and who knows the baby (if there is one) could be the best thing that ever happened.|`|n4BBs7TSaa	there is no way to lessen the blow, and having him there depends on your parents, it could show a sign of solidarity, however if you think your BF is not going to stick around i would do it by yourself and explain that you don't think he will|`|dSobv28maa	make sure dad doesnt have a shotgun in hand when you tell them, if your bf is there.|`|dB6MR0wYaa	the boyfriend might get killed if your parents react the wrong way|`|tFFLXi1Waa	find out first if you're really pregnant|`|wdLqioPiaa	your ridiculous.<br>  If you are pregnant, I feel so sorry for your child.
7jdvcrTKaa	The best thing to do is wait a week or so and take a test, however, with your condition it is always good to go and see your doctor and tell her what you have been experiencing.  Even if you decide to wait and take a test, if it comes out negative, you should still go to your doctor and make sure that there is nothing that could be upsetting your PCOS.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Wait a week and test again.|`|piCMW7ZCaa	only thing to do is wait to take another test! good luck!
fPuZGkmsaa	I like Leah Bailey. I wasn't sure at first but as I thought about it I decided that I like it. For the boys names, although I like Ryan Lucas I have to agree with some of the other people that it flows very well together but it is way to common. Lucas is also common but not as much as Ryan. In the end all of your names are easy to spell and pronounce and can not be made into nasty nicknames. That was 2 out of the 3 things that I was looking for when I was choosing baby names. I say go for Leah Bailey and /or Lucas Ryan. Good Luck|`|v6YcSPVjaa	Leah Bailey is cute. I usually would say use the spelling Lia, but Lia Bailey just looks awkward as it is so repetitive with the vowels. I like Lucas Ryan better as I am just not fond of the name Ryan but Ryan Lucas flows better undoubtedly. Good luck though, and that's funny about your sons "showing off", when my mom was pregnant with my brother Alexander we went into an ultrasound when she was 13 weeks. The nurse scanned around for a bit and asked my mom if she was going to find out the gender. She said yes and the tech said I am thinking it's a boy, not 100% sure but it really looks as so he is in fact a boy. When she printed the photos you could see his tiny parts already! At about 20 weeks we went back and they did the 4D, sure enough he was a boy, still showing off his little boy parts!! He's 18 months now and loves to run around bare naked! Haha. I guess he feels back at "home" when he runs bare naked! Haha. Good luck!|`|U2w775zZaa	OMG! I love Leah Bailey thats so pretty. <br>  <br>  And i also love Lucas Ryan its gorgeous go with those names they are gorgeous.|`|QUA9EaZQaa	Leah Bailey is very cute.  I like Ryan Lucas - but I have a Ryan myself so I guess I just like that name.|`|PoBIyZ27aa	I think Ryan Lucas flows the best and sounds really nice. Leah Bailey is an adorable name for a girl!|`|MikhcVZfaa	I ? Ryan Lucas!|`|uS07WAwcaa	Lucas Ryan is such a nice and really cool uncommmon name, nice choice! I really dont like Leah Bailey.<br>  My name is Leah and I love my name: Leah Aeryn :)|`|35JIECGRaa	Leah Bailey is nice ... Lea Baileigh is also a cuter spelling for it (your spelling is a little bit too masculine for me).<br>  <br>  I love the name Ryan, so I would love to see that be the first name ... I would probably go with Ryan Lucas!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and congratulations on your pregnancy! Let me know what you decide! :)|`|4b5IQWcFaa	u hav unique names<br>  <br>  i like leah bayle and leah bailey<br>  <br>  ryan luke doesnt go together<br>  <br>  i like ryan lucas john or something like that.add a last name for ryan lucas<br>  <br>  lucas ryan is perfectly ok and fine but sounds kinda ordinary.|`|k1tF8gToaa	i like leah, its my best friend name. <br>  leah bailey.. hmm. i think i like it(:<br>  <br>  lucas ryan, i think it sounds better.|`|76740ad28a40658e6b40499a8b2cb447aa	Lucas Ryan. I love the name Lucas and Lucas Ryan flows the best.|`|tHEBPDenaa	Leah Bailey is cute and I would go with Lucas Ryan for a boy!
gFiRi5xnaa	No. The thought of the whole family being together is a nice thought, but I watched a show about home births, and this woman had everything showing while her 2 and 7 year old were down there staring as the baby came out. It seems like that would scar them for life. Not to mention the woman giving birth is screaming and then a baby comes out. If I were a kid that would haunt me for life.|`|NMzlbWt8aa	I think it would be incredibly traumatic to for a child to view its mother or any woman to give birth.  Especially when its a young child and the woman is in lots of pain, screaming cussing etc...|`|DRb4Qlypaa	Well 13 and 14 year olds are teenagers, and even though they may be mature enough I do not see myself letting anyone that age watch lol. But I think the hospital will let them in only 18+, which some that age still can't handle it lol|`|8FKfqYn1aa	No.<br>  <br>  I saw a live birth when I was 13 and nearly fainted.|`|47HPrDe5aa	Yeah I think anyone who wants to should be able to!|`|Xg1FTDgPaa	I  think  if  they  want  to|`|IFDfpbFJaa	If they want to I wouldn't mind but I wouldn't suggest that for a school field trip.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	why not..|`|yDWcYXl5aa	There's a lot of questions I'd have such as is it their mom (I'd be uncomfortable having my children watch me).  Are they sweamish?  Are they mature?<br>  <br>  My son was raised on a farm, and helped me help animals give birth with great success.  At 14, he was asked to be a labor coach for a girl he ended up dating for 4 years (the child wasn't his).  He was great, and I was a wreck.  He's very, very mature for his age, and tough, even if he faints at getting a tetnus shot, he can give them all day long-LOL.|`|AUsvrW8faa	If they can get through it, yes, that's something they should have viewed.  A cousin was having a baby at the hospital and she was hollaring- my sister thought the girls were upset and tried to calm  them down and my niece said... Mommy, she's just having a baby! (Like she knew all that was normal) - Kids can handle more than we think.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If they can handle it.<br>  <br>  Some adults even pass out when they see something that graphic lol so it would depend on the maturity of the individual.|`|AA11595906	I've never thought of this before and I'm quite torn.  I personally still wouldn't want to see a live birth as I'm terribly squeamish, but I imagine it could possibly help deter teenage pregnancy.

That's what I would say is average.<br>  <br>  But all children should sleep at 9:00<br>  <br>  But  then again, it depends on when you start school and what you'll be doing the next day, so there is no wrong or right answer.|`|9sGBIx2Aaa	Try reading before you go to bed instead of watching T.V or playing video games.

wKuQC4yTaa	cramping is normal right after finishing, it should go away shortly after. You can also spot a little too.  i have had no problems throughout my whole pregnancy with sex, besides the little cramping and spotting from it.  If you have a high risk pregnancy this time then you shouldn't but if you have seen the heartbeat you are fine. I had to refrain from sex when i was pregnant last time, but it didn't keep me from miscarrying though.|`|AA10526033	Well since you had miscarriages before I would talk to your dr about the safety of sex right now. But yes cramping is normal after sex and for no reason. as long as it doesnt get worse and you bleed a lot you are fine. and no sex between 6-9 wks doesnt cause miscarriages! some people dont even know they are pregnant then! i have irregular periods and didnt know i was prego for 3 months with my first 2!
4HDhjmJDaa	My brother and his wife recently informed the family that they're expecting in a cool way. It was my mom's birthday, and they gave her a card that said "Grandma" on the front, instead of one that said mom. She understood immediately and the look on her face was wonderful. I don't know if that'll work for your situation, since it's not your first child, but something similar might be good.|`|mNU0bEUsaa	I invited all our family over for a "special" dinner. I served baby corn, baby-back ribs. baby shrimp, etc. Then I made a game about it and asked who could guess the recurring theme in the meal. My mom guessed, and we gave her a special pillow that had "grandma" on it. It was really fun and unique!
3w7VztEWaa	how can mothers be judged as a bad mother?? I don't see you as a bad mother.. you doing what you think is right.

The person who spoke to you harshly was very out of line, you gave birth, you are raising your son so who are they to say anything?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your health though! :)|`|FEg0PDdnaa	Breast feeding versus formula feeding is a very hot topic, some people have some very strong opinions. Do your best not to let it bother you. You are the only one who knows what is best for your baby and don't let anyone tell you any different. You are not selfish and I'm sorry that anyone would think of telling you that. You sound like you are trying to do your very best for your little boy and that's wonderful.|`|46ijdaH6aa	WOW Whoever said that is a complete ***!! That is horrible. Yes I highly reccomend breastfeeding .. I did for 18 months BUT if you have to take medicine that could possibly harm your child, then it's good your not breastfeeding. I know ALOT of women who don't breastfeed, and their children are perfectly fine. I think you made the right decision!!|`|cIn8BkYHaa	I completely agree with you. Some narrow minded people just need to learn that you were looking out for your son, there are mediciations you do not want to put in baby's body. Your son is still getting fed and loved so why is it anyone else's concern? I respect your decision.|`|g7epb7o4aa	You made a decision that was best for yourself and your baby.  You have nothing to feel guilty about your baby is doing well . I had to feed both my children formula because of medication i have to take and they both did well.|`|TVqXrOq2aa	Your son is better off with a happy mommy and formula than a depressed mom with breast milk... think about it.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	yes, the person is a schmuck......cut them out of your life|`|KQF5X9Vpaa	You're not a bad mom and whoever told you that needs to keep their mouth shut...i formula fed our daughter and she's a perfectly health one year old...all 6 of my moms children were formula fed and we're all healthy and happy...now days formula has almost the same nutrients in it that breastmilk does...science has improved on it so much...babies are getting much of the same nutrients...what you did was what was right for you...each mom chooses what is best in their situation and no one should judge them for that...just like i get judged for starting our daughter on cereal and fruits at 3 months old because our doctor told us too...I'm not a bad mother and neither are you...keep your chin up...and next time you see that person you tell him or her to kiss your ***...lol i think you get the picture|`|Mh8pATk8aa	you are right, your health is more important than whatever small potential health benefits exist for breastfeeding over formula feeding and she was out of line. tons of women use formula for various reasons and the reality is that not everyone can breastfeed even if they want to. i was formula-fed and i think i turned out just fine. tell that b#!#$ to mind her own business.|`|mA1Z69oFaa	Only ur son will be able to judge the type of mother u r to him. U made a choice that u felt was right. It is more important for ur child to have a happy & healthy mom than breast milk. I made a choice to breast feed both of my babies one for 13 months the other for 7. Circumstances aren't always the same. It's all about what is best for YOU & ur baby because ur baby needs u to be the best mom that u can be.|`|zQQkRR6paa	I keep reading and hearing such ignorant comments from both sides of this argument and I don't get it. We ALL know that beast milk is whats best for baby. And in a perfect world we would all feed our babies whats best. But this is not a perfect world and sometimes we all need to do what we need to do. You did what you needed to do and everyone has come out healthy and happy in the end. You made a tough decision and it was in the best interest of your baby. Good for you.<br>  <br>  No one well ever be 'right' in the argument. And no one should have to defend themselves whether they choose boob or bottle. As long as our children are fed and loved and taken care of I think there are far worse things out there to waste our energy complaining about.  Just read the news....Im sure theres some sad news story with a child involved, and breast or bottle was the least of their problems.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Don't let people's closed minds bother you on here. Take it with a pinch of salt. All that matters is like you say, happy mum = happy baby. You know you're a good mum :)|`|5f6XnInEaa	Because, simply put, some people out there are just plain ignorant.<br>  <br>  I had depression too, and went onto formula, and it wasn't the general public that gave me hell, it was breast feeding nazi's on this site.<br>  <br>  I really have no idea why they have to say anything, since what I feed my son is my business.<br>  <br>  I love how peoples attitude can be "I'm pro abortion" then in the next breath, they are "You are a terrible mother for formula feeding"<br>  <br>  Don't take it to heart.<br>  It was probably some ignorant mother who was just looking for a reason to think she is better than you.|`|u94HOVz7aa	happy mom = happy baby!!! do whats right for you and ignore those who tell you you wrong.  i formula fed my babies and they are happy healthy 4 and 6 year olds now! i feel like that some times, but i just say its my baby and i will make the choices when its your baby you can make the choices.|`|4TNavgDuaa	I breastfeed my baby and I dont put down others that don't.

I agree with everything you said.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	Whoever told you that you are a bad mom needs to sit back and shut up. More than 75% of women today do not breast feed. breast feeding is not always the best thing for a baby, when the mother smokes or has other medical conditions that require medications then the baby should get formula. Whatever the mother ingests is what the baby ingests when he is given the breast milk. You are not a bad mom over feeding formula. I am a mother of 3 boys and all of them are healthy active children. Whoever told you that your a bad mom needs to read all your answers. it is hard to take words like that, you didn't deserve it and the accuser owes you a big apology.|`|kj1md6t0aa	WOW, totally ignore that nasty comment. You are not a bad mom. All these moms who breastfeed - good for you, that's great that you do, but some women either can't or just choose not to and it's all about what is best for each individual family .. not what you think is best for someone you don't even know.|`|OWReYgV5aa	I think you're right.  I wasn't breastfed and I've led a healthy normal life.  Formula is fine....of course breast milk is the better choice..but if formula were so bad, they wouldn't offer it....right?  <br>  Some people will just NEVER mind their own business and that's just the way it is.  You just have to shrug it off and tell them "thanks for your opinion"..and move on.  UGH..just hearing that story makes me angry!!|`|heDtLdz5aa	don't let people bother you you did what you needed to do..your baby is healthy that is all that matters.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	omg she was way out of line, u did the right thing and u should put urself first coz if ur not happy then ur baby wouldnt be happy|`|DRb4Qlypaa	No this is a decision that only you could make, and it is completely your business only. Who is she (or who does she think she is) that you actually care what she has to say, anyway? Regardless of personal choice, I would never tell someone that one was better than the other. People have been formula feeding babies for quite a while and they aren't dead yet, I was formula fed and was really smart. I am going to try to breastfeed but if I can't thin I will not worry about it, the only reason it is really that much better is just because it is free lol!|`|KihffCc5aa	I was on meds for both of my babies, the first I tried to breastfeed, and I just KNEW something was wrong.  Come to find out 3 years later, you shouldn't take that anti-depressant while PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING!  Thankfully, that child is find, and advanced.  But I knew something was wrong, but it wasn't medically acknowledged at that time.<br>  <br>  My cousin, she was on anti-depressants and told the nurses she wasn't going to breastfeed.  I was there for her labor and delivery, EVERY NURSE THAT CAME IN threw breastfeeding in her face, and my cousin constantly told them.... "I'm on meds, will be taking meds, it's not worth the risk!"<br>  <br>  I cursed out nurses for trying to wear my cousin down while she was in labor, etc.!<br>  <br>  Breastmilk is best, for most.  But for a huge population, it isn't!  And, our formula fed babies are just as healthy!  I think every mom would be inclined to breastfeed, if they knew it was in their baby's best interest, for many it isn't!<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with bottle feeding your baby formula, don't ever forget that!<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|Lprtz2A9aa	Nope I don't think your out of line. People sometimes have good advice but sometimes they don't. I wanted to breast feed my son and after trying in the hospital, we found out I had no milk. He had to go on formula. And anybody who would tell me I'm a bad mom was told to kiss my rear. I had no choice just as you did not. If your in bad health you can hardly take care of your baby like you should. Your doing just fine.....|`|ejQ3yg9Naa	I absolutely know how you feel. Everyone asks me if I'm going to breast feed and I say no because I have to be on heart medication right after shes born, and I still get lectured. The heart meds would hurt her, which is why I didn't take them through my whole pregnancy. But pregnancy greatly weakened my heart so I have to take them when she's born or she might not have a mommy. But I'm still called selfish for not breastfeeding, I think I've been as unselfish as you can be though. Alright done ranting. I agree with you.
MLFBsZnUaa	The only thing I can really suggest is think back to when your last normal period was, and do your best to calculate when each one should have been after that until now. Then calculate 28 days (or however many days it was with your cycle before) and take a test then. I, too, just started Depo in December. I am having the same prob right now...but I've had to wait to test til my "missed period" was supposed to be. But, I finally get to tomorrow. I would just relax and try to calculate. If you cant or have a hard time, go straight to your Doc and have them do a blood test. I've been told that the blood test can come back positive a lot early than a home test can. My best friend found out when she was only 2 weeks along with a blood test. Good luck, try to relax, and everything will work out!|`|5lRevKBoaa	you should test asap because when i was 8 months pregnant my friend got on the Depo shot and 4 months later she felt baby kicks and she was 17 weeks pregnant.go check that out if you haven't got ur period it could also be stressed!<br>  <br>  hope you the best.|`|vkA0JUu5aa	hi... first of all the Depo shot is horrible.. i took it for 3 and a half years because im not one for taking pills... anyways i lost two children while i was on the needle. they told me i could not get pregnant on the needle. Also after i stopped get Depo... i had a period for four months straight then no period for months. My best friend took the needle to for a year and now she is not able to have kids. The needle  is the worst thing to ever put into your body. P.S. Congrats if you are:)|`|h1AIzD9baa	yes yes yes yes.. it happened to my sis.. and <br>  <br>  statistics are rather low.. but possible.. check it out.. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1997/conceptbl.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fda.gov/Fdac/features/1997/co...</a>
cEXzXkqnaa	try edging it gently to three hours...add and extra 15mins every other feeding until you get to the three hour mark. <br>  Also...to prevent the head moving...nurse in a quiet place and cover yourself and him up with a blanket so he cannot get distracted and be tempted to look around and take breaks.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	is he getting a good latch to begin with? and babies that are becoming more aware of their surroundings can be distracted by almost anything bc it is all new to them.|`|ev8ZZYx2aa	Your baby is acting like he is not getting enough milk or is not getting a good latch or you are having a very overactive let down when he is letting go. Make sure that his latch is positioned well. Some babies continue to feed every 10-12 times a day for many months. How do you feel your milk supply is?|`|vsFJZRkGaa	Ellen T is right! my son is 4.5mths and exactly the same.<br>  <br>  he is teething as well and he is formula fed but still does the same with the latching on and off. If i put an extra 60mls in the bottle, he doesn't drink it, but then wants a full bottle again 2hs later! we've put it down to a growth spurt.<br>  <br>  to help him drink without going on and off constantly, i've been draping a light cloth over my shoulder. he isn't anywhere near as distracted and drinks more at one sitting. maybe it would help you too?<br>  <br>  i say keep on feeding as he wants it, your supply will increase as needed and he will settle back to normal in no time at all. I wouldn't be tempted to try solids just yet if you can help it.<br>  <br>  meanwhile use nipple cream to help your nipples survive these annoying few days! and after each feed rub some breast milk over your nipples and let it air dry.|`|eRyCzwMcaa	Your son is probably going through a growth spurt.  This shouldn't last too long.<br>  <br>  Nurse him when he is hungry (he doesn't need any food outside of breastmilk) in a place that is quiet where you both can relax.  You want to limit any distractions you can.  Then you can attempt to pump after the feeding. <br>  <br>  Your breastmilk supply will increase with this increased demand.  Give it a little time.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	He's not getting enough at one time.  You may want to supplement him on some feedings or add cereal to your breast milk in a bottle.  This gives your breast a break.|`|CZg79Qy9aa	You may need to start giving him a little amount of baby cereal from a spoon mixed with your breast milk or in a bottle with your breast milk and a special nipple for breast fed babies.  My nephew did this and that was the only way they could get him to go longer between feedings and to feel satisfied.|`|psHaJDa5aa	start giving him a little cereal before bed (about 2 hrs before) it can help keep him fuller during the night. My son is 7 months now and when he was that age it was every 2-21/2 hours also. DO NOT GIVE A BABY CERAL IN A BOTTLE WITH FORMULA. It is a chocking hazard and isn't safe.|`|edffl6oDaa	WELL DONE FOR BREAST FEEDING! My three month old is the same. She feeds every 2 hours day and night. Have you checked his gums? Maybe he's teething so its uncomfortable to feed or gas perhaps. What ever you do DONT give him solids. His gut isnt ready and it'll do more harm than good. Just do your best to preserver, its such a short time in the scheme of things<br>  <br>  YOU'RE DOING GREAT! KEEP IT UP
AA10624857	There are several reasons why this isn't accurate. First, after ejaculation the sperm swim rather quickly from the seminal fluid through the cervical mucous. They are well on their way through the cervix headed towards the fallopian tubes searching for the egg before you even have time to get up and go to the bathroom. The fluid that comes out of the woman after sex is a combination of the seminal fluid (may contain some sperm, but most are gone by now) and the lubrication that a woman makes during sexual arousal. Second, pee comes out of the urinary tract which is a completely different opening than the vaginal opening. So, urine is not going to "flush out" anything that is in the vagina. It is recommended to pee after sex to help prevent any bacteria from getting into the urinary tract which can cause an infection. Peeing after sex does not reduce your risk of pregnancy.|`|DDYwnut6aa	FALSE.   Semen will come back out - semen is simply the fluid that carries the sperm.  Some sperm may come back out with it, but you're talking MILLIONS of sperm.  They take off for their destination immediately.   So no, it's not true.|`|ztzEloj5aa	no- bacteria builds up in your urinary tract during sex- you should pee after sex to keep a healthy urinary tract otherwise you can get a uti.<br>  if the sperm is inside your uterus- like i hope it is there is no chance your urine can get in- does this make sense.|`|q0DntFi1aa	I do not beleive it; however, if you can hold it, do not get up right away.  Maybe you will have a better chance of getting pregnant.  I tried it and it did work.|`|ARUVea4yaa	urine kills sperm and you can get some out but it doesn't mean it all comes out there is always a chance of pregnancy with unprotected sex|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Well some of the sperm travels when the other just comes out,so i dont think all of it comes out!
NVxGp317aa	I wouldn't worry to much as far as apendacitis goes. The pain is uaully on right side but if your not running a fever or vomiting more then normal wouldn't be concerned with that. It could be your gallbladder but that pain is uaully not as low and usually tends to come and go after eating certin foods.<br>  I would definetly bring it up with your doctor. It could just be ligament pain everything is growing and shifting. I've had some of the same pain and was told it is round ligaments.<br>  If you are spotting or are really worried go to the er they will run some test to make sure not infection and do an ultrasound to check on baby.<br>  Good luck try to rest.|`|He1WjHifaa	go to the ER if youre really worried. appendicitis is left side pain and gallbladder is right side but not really lower abdomen and usually both cause nause and vomiting so its probably not that but if it continues id call the on call OB-GYN and theyll tell you if it sounds like you need to go to the ER|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Appendicitis is what it sounds like to me. Everyone might not have the same symptoms. Go to hospital and get checked out right away. Better to be safe.|`|AA11820380	If the pain is lasting that long, I suggest you take no chances. Go to the ER right away. It could be nothing but it could also be something.|`|AA11540024	it's your baby growing!
SA6dCr0Laa	im so sorry for your loss.<br>  i know some mothers who actually lost weight durring pregnancy, and towards the end they only gained about 20lbs.( dont know what that is in kilos) i know that u are worried being that u had a misfortune, but u are still early on into the pregnancy and u probably still dont show. <br>  i recommend eating healthy and drinking ur prenatal pills. i dont think u should over eat just to gain weight. the baby will always take nutrients from your body first , then whatever u intake is for u. <br>  i hope this helps i have 2 children .good luck and stay strong|`|m8alP5kPaa	I would talk to your doctor about it. I wouldn't be so concerned with gaining a ton of weight...as long as your taking care of yourself and eating healthy..you should be fine. <br>  <br>  I'm 8 months pregnant and I've only gained 20 pounds my entire pregnancy and the baby is perfectly fine.|`|KCS862Qaaa	actually, ur 2 months pregnant. stop lying.|`|wgHuJxtwaa	mcdonalds|`|SW7EfdCGaa	I have had 2 children and with my first I was 55 kg full term second 60 kg full term (really light huh?). Speak to your doctor (get some tests to clear your mind) as unfortunately you have already lost one this weight gain might be related to that. Otherwise don't worry so much have fun buying bits and pieces.<br>  <br>  PS I am so sorry I wish you all the best|`|O1XyigGqaa	You need to gain weight? Damn girl you are lucky(; haha.<br>  This should be fun. Just... eat a lot moreand lay around the house like a couch potato ad everything shall fall into place lol.<br>  I'm sorry about the one baby tho :(|`|uFePxcIjaa	done exercise, eat more of the fatty-but healthy foods, and ask a doctor or nutritionist!<br>  <br>  good luck babes ;)|`|m3cf7vsAaa	Go to your DOCTOR and tell him that you aren't gaining weight.  They should run labs and see what the problem is.|`|HOdblqIkaa	the weight will probably come on later which sometimes happens. go to your dr and have everything checked out to make sure your baby is ok. take your vitamins and drink plenty of water to keep hydrated and eat healthy and not just everything in your path.|`|CNDdRFR2aa	I'm so sorry
GWveqx61aa	i heard it feels like menstral cramps, and it starts about maybe 4 weeks into and can last through the whole pregnancy, but all woman are different|`|96HWpdkFaa	Light cramping.<br>  It starts very early on. sometimes before you know your pregnant!|`|cSm1zod4aa	it starts fairly early, you will probably start to feel it at about 9 or 10 weeks possibly earlier, it just feels like cramps. Although i'm 6 months now and it hurtssss lol. Makes you very sore and makes you walk funny lol.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	I have never known anyone to actually feel their uterus stretch. Think of all the girls/women who don't know they are prego until months later!
jNErU39iaa	There is an age guideline for the stage one and two cereal on the packet. E.g 6-7 months, 7-9 months.<br>  <br>  You start on ONE feeding per day. This may only be a spoonful or two for the first week or so while the baby gets used to it. You just feed him as much as he wants and don't try to force him. If he won't eat it, just give it a rest and try again in a few days.<br>  <br>  Feed him about an hour after his last bottle/breastfeed, because if your baby is really hungry, he won't eat the cereal, he will just want his milk.<br>  <br>  -They say not to feed a baby before 6 months of age (4 months at the very least) and you should probably consult your doctor if you are planning to feed him and he's under the age of 6 months.  Good Luck =]
Q7ATGTCsaa	My best guess is that you ovulated on the 21st. Snot like or egg white-like cervical mucous is the best indicator for ovulation. Considering sperm can live 2-5 days inside, you may actually have good luck this time around, since you had sex on the 20th. Hope everything works out for you!
dc05acb14cd8ef4d0acc29a54b8d9584aa	I was expecting mine this weekend and thought I was getting it the other day when I saw red on the tp.  that only lasted a few hours and I didn't even need a liner.  weird, but I've had that before and my period usually comes the next day or so.<br>  <br>  the past few months my periods have suddenly been regular (I have PCOS) so I wouldn't be surprised if they were suddenly irregular again.  I'm not even really trying as I'm quite heavy and would like to lose weight first, but it would be nice if I was.  :D<br>  <br>  I have symptoms, but it could be pms also.  the bloated/heavy feeling, the super sore nipples, the vaguely sore breasts, the way I cried when I read a childhood neighbor's obituary (we didn't even know them that well).  I've had a baby before so I can't go by the tubercules and I'm super fair and I've always been able to see all of my veins (that always grossed me out!

I had myself convinced I was pregnant 2 days ago, but AF is arriving just like freakin clockwork!  :S  Your symptoms all point to a potential pregnancy but please don't be hard on yourself if it isn't.  How long have you been ttc?  Do you chart your temps and cm?  If you haven't yet, you should definately read "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler and "The Conception Chronicles" by Patty Debano, Courtney Menzel and Shelly Sutphen.  They are a must read for TTC's!  :)|`|bj19SHdYaa	I am too! I keep getting negative hpt's been testing since 8dpo ( I know that's early) I'm going crazy.

So still holding on to hope.|`|ARUVea4yaa	mine was due today and nothing so i am praying that this is our month! i hope you are pregnant! Baby dust!

5N3odm3Qaa	Go to Planned Parenthood for a blood test. It will be very cheap, if not free (if you qualify). Or you can go to your doctor's office where a nurse will draw bloods if a urine test turns up negative.|`|NcHsbFXhaa	any positives are positives, doesn't matter how faint they are<br>  <br>  congrats|`|7xit1ogxaa	Are you drinking a lot before you test? If so, it can cause a false negative due to your urine being too diluted. Your best bet is to test with first morning urine or to wait at least four hours after drinking something before you test. If you have had 2 positives you more than likely are pregnant.

01Mu3wUeaa	I am emetophobic too (severe) and I am sooo fortunate that my son hardly ever gets sick.Other than a few times spitting up as an infant, he has only vomited once and I was actually surprised at how calm I stayed (as to before I thought I would run screaming out of the house lol)<br>  <br>  I also was lucky enough to move into a house that is fitted with hard wood floors throughout so it is fairly easy to clean up and I don't have to get down and scrub (thank God) <br>  <br>  I do think that when my son enters that school age, my nerves will be on edge none stop because we all know how quickly kids spread germs.<br>  <br>  I will just be sure to keep my son's hands washed right when he comes home and wash his clothes in bleach (bleach is the only thing that will kill Norwalk virus aka the stomach bug...unfortuantly Lysol won't)<br>  <br>  <br>  egghh.I don't want to think about it lol.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	There is some wonderful stuff called Absorb-A-Mess if you can find it.  It's like what janitors use to clean up accidents at school.  You sprinkle the stuff on the vomit and a few minutes later you can vacuum it up.  Since I had my second child, I've been wondering where I could get more of it.  Fortunately, it hasn't been a big problem.<br>  <br>  When clothes get thrown up on, put them in the washer ASAP and do a rinse cycle first, then just wash as usual.  You can add a half cup of Pine-Sol to the wash if it makes you feel better.<br>  <br>  I sympathize.  Sometimes I get carsick when my daughter does!
Cx5Zo7IIaa	Did the Dr do a culture? If he did wait and see what it is. If it is the flu do not give her the antibiotics. Doctors like this prescribe stuff to make mothers feel better, not to necessarily cure the cold. It makes mommy feel better to do something like giving the baby medicine instead of watching the poor thing 'suffer'.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If you are 100% sure that this is a viral infection and not a bacterial infection, then tell your sister to keep the antibiotics away.<br>  <br>  Sarah UK is sadly wrong.Antibiotics are for BACTERIAL infections...not VIRAL infections.They will not do anything except harm the little one.Antibiotics kill the bad AND the good bacteria in our bodies.<br>  <br>  I suggest taking the little one to a different doctor because you obviously cannot trust this doctor's judgment.|`|oHsxp5weaa	Different medications sponsor different doctors. The more the doctor prescribes his sponsored  medication the more money he gets. I had a doctor who would prescribe me valume for a head ache when Tylenol would do the trick. Guess who his sponsor was? You did the smart thing, but you can always report a doctor and get him in trouble. You never know you may just save someone's life.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	Well are you sure it was the flu?<br>  It could have been a sinus infection or strep - which have similar symptoms.<br>  <br>  If not, she should call back and ask why she has them.<br>  And she shouldn't take them unless they tell her to - there are complications, like high risks for a yeast infection. Not nice.|`|h1AIzD9baa	no the doctor should have given her an antivirul .. like  Tamiflu not an antibiotic.. antibiotics are for bacterial infections and the flu is definatly virul... young doctor?? he should have gone back to the books on this on..  but im no doctor and its obvious to me..|`|9yP43Peiaa	Doctors are reluctant to prescribe Anti biotics. they only prescribe if they think its necessary. In your own words ''i don't know much about the medical field '' And you are 100 percent right! You are going by your own individual feelings! Amoxicillin actually saves lives and is excellent for viral infections. You say 'Flu' This has become a general term for colds and other virus's. Does she have influenza literally? If so then I would advise that you do as the Doctor ordered. There is a nasty flu strain over the world at the moment which can linger on the chest if not treated.<br>  <br>  Influenza still kills people. Young children,the elderly and people with other conditions are particularly susceptible.|`|CNWeNd4Jaa	uhh, why not ask the doctor about it? <br>  <br>  Plenty of times a virus will weaken your immune system and cause bacterial infections also.
DDYwnut6aa	No.  Implantation bleeding, as much as you hear people talk of it, is actually very rare.  Only 20% of pregnancies present with implantation bleeding.|`|739d2c0f3a827ed66532c97b8757d73faa	no you don't have to have implatation bleeding|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I didn't bleed.  My biggest differences that happened when i got pregnant was i had extremely sore boobs- especially my nipples, and i got pretty bad cramps.  I did have to get on some medicines to get pregnant so it could just have been from the hormone increase, but i think it was because of the pregnancy itself.  (this is my first baby so i can't be sure if this is normal with pregnancy or just being filled with medicine!)  I hope this helps, i know it was long but i always give a ton of details!|`|cIn8BkYHaa	Definately not, the one time I was sure I had implantation bleeding and got really excited it turned out to be nothing at all. In fact when I found out I was pregnant I was in shock because that cycle I had no symptoms at all. It varies in women and each pregnancy. Don't stress, and good luck to you.|`|SUT3yL0oaa	I didn't have any implantation bleeding. I did have a lot more cm than normal on the cycle I conceived but no other signs or symptoms of pregnancy.|`|6r5obUfiaa	Nope, u dont need to bleed for that. Some people do bleed and some doesnt. It depends on people

If you put your hand on the top of your belly you will feel it get hard when you contract and relax when it's over. Don't worry. When you are in labor you will know. Some women feel the majority of the pain in their lower back so don't disregard it as pregnancy aches.|`|QTWGaT6gaa	Thats just prelabor. Your body is just getting ready for labor.

I just snap her in the car or unsnap and take her out w/o having to remove her from her carseat that she usually falls asleep in. It's very easy to use. We've had for 11 months now and it shows no signs of falling apart.|`|NSMV0XCEaa	I have a Graco Travel System and LOVEEE it. I just put my son in his car seat and lock it onto the Stroller. It is very easy to use. Also, It is light weight which is good for me because I have 30 steps to go up. By cousin has one ans she has had it for 3 years now and it still works like new. Also, if your on a tight budget it is good because they are not that expensive but very worth the money.
cY8DgJv5aa	Its highly likely that it was your period (assuming your period was actually due).  Just spotting wouldn't fill a tampon.  I think you're just being paranoid.  That being said, there's no way to know for sure without taking a test.  Wait about 2 weeks and see how you feel.  If you're still worried, take a test (it should be accurate by then).  Considering you have been taking birth control for 2 months and you got your period, I seriously doubt you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  If you are still this paranoid about getting pregnant though, then you need to reevaluate your decision to be having sex in the first place.  If just being on birth control isn't easing your mind, then make him wear a condom.  If you still find yourself freaking out all the time, then perhaps you just aren't ready to be sexually active.|`|g9vw4ovGaa	Oh dear god, we have another moron bringing a child into this world, honey if you're not responsible enough to take your Birth Control like you're supposed to, don't and im begging DON'T have sex!!! If you missed the two pills in the second to third week into your pack, yes you are very likely to be pregnant, if you missed in the first week you should be ok, but could still be pregnant. If you were expecting your period then it should be your period. Your period will come when your on your last week of pills. If you missed those, no big deal you're not pregnant. Pulling out is NOT a method of birth control. Obvisouly you're not old enough to handle the responsobilty of taking your birthcontrol like you are supposed to. Also, the spotting could be from missing the pills, if it is, count your blessings and use a rubber. Freakin Idiot!|`|HwUfcYsAaa	Sweets you can't get pregnant the day before your period.  The majority of women ovulate 1/2 way between their cycle (don't use this as a method for birth control!!) The fact that u had sex right before your period means u are probably not pregnant.  If you do not want a child you need to protect yourself!  Do not rely on a man to pull out!  Ever!  Some little guys are released before the main surge and guys don't pull out fast enough.  Make him wear condoms (esp to protect yourself!) and keep up with your birth control.  Being a mom is a big responsibility and so is being a woman.  Take care of yourself first.|`|dUglyCKDaa	Probably not. Dont worry about it unless you get like belly aching or feeling weird.|`|eya1WDS4aa	Go get a test. it could go either way. and you should do some more sex ed because pulling out can get you pregnant.|`|ynPhusW9aa	no ur not pregnant. just try not to skip the pill again.|`|i9BgSAMjaa	maybe bc of birth control see a doctor|`|gVtmEsG9aa	i dont think so otherwise you couldnt bleed at all|`|iXfGzOdlaa	no, dont be worried about it. your body is most likely getting use to the birthcontrol so thats is why your spotting. <br>  your fine.<br>  =]<br>  and if your on birthcontrol. you dont have to pull out. btu you should use a condom.....<br>  STD's are kinda gay|`|mXFiSe2taa	I HAVE HAD THIS HAPPEN.

Because you did recieve your period. but since the bleeding was odd and not regular for you.<br>  it is definitely a chance of pregnancy. also because of the pills i think they can be odd as they are hormones going into the body.<br>  <br>  if you want to wait until next period time to see if it comes to test . or do a blood test which is 100% accurate.<br>  i think that you arent darling.<br>  God bless x But you never know until you test|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Lol, spotting does not mean you're pregnant, many things can cause spotting. Such as BC.|`|h3IjAuCgaa	are you meaning this thursday friday gone by ? if so your not pregnant your period could be just light and can be on birth control ,But like that first person said pull out method is not a type of contraception ,If you had sex last month with the pull out method and you only just started the birth control well you could very well be pregnant what you went through could of been implant bleeding so take a test if its negative then your safe please even if your on birth control and do not have the one partner use a condom !|`|AH3wnGbcaa	wow you shouldn't have "beep" (sorry) at this age. but since we cant go back in life you just need to do what you gotta do. just get a pregnancy test to make sure. but if you are pregnant you need to let someone know, and do not NOT get an abortion. raise the baby than adopt<br>  or if your not pregnant then just chill, and because of this experience you should learn never to have "beep" until married. (:<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Are you stupid?  The pull out method is NOT a method of birth control.  Haha.  Idiot.|`|Zr1neefJaa	gg
g9vw4ovGaa	Hubby is in the Army. You're pregnant, your boobs will hurt like no other, in a few weeks you'll start to get sick. You will be about  or 10 weeks but go to wal-mart and get a pregnancy test, if this said man is the father, which will have to be proven by a DNA test he is required to pay child support that comes directly out of his check, unless you get married which is the better option because you'll have free health care. Call him ASAP and let him know you think you're pregnant, then go get a test and be positive. If you're 9 weeks it will be 99.9%. If you want more info on what the army will force him to do, then IM me at b.whitington|`|de103785bc2af3eaeb12cf72d96e7f9caa	Just take the home pregnancy test.  They are usually accurate.|`|oGWmSzBCaa	i would just take a hpt and see what that says and if you want you could make a dr. appointment just to really make sure you are|`|pPj2eN2taa	very high chance you are pregnant. just take a home test|`|h1AIzD9baa	take a hpt.. .. by now you would get accurate results..|`|aqto0hJTaa	Take an EPT.  There's no need for the expensive blood test.
EvRIwz4Laa	no! If you are not a runner in certian situations OBGYNs will tell you it is best not to run or participate in activities that spike your heart rate. But, that is a precautionary measure and in most cases would not ever cause harm. In some small percentage of cases it could be bad and that is why they tell you that. Now if you are already a runner it is 100% fine. I am a lifetime runner and I have twin girls last April. I ran 4 times  a week the doctors said it was fine and my girls were happy and healthy from day one.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Running only kills food babies.|`|QSodlfMraa	no|`|d0ddKfnCaa	No that is not true.  If you have run before the pregnancy you will be fine running while you are pregnant.  I did and there are many other mom's that have done it.  Also talk to your doctor and see what they say.  Your health is a huge factor.<br>  <br>  Also if you are looking for cute baby stuff for your little one to reflect your running lifestyle go to www.SamaKiTush.com|`|NPmRmnG6aa	No, if you were a runner before you got pregnant than it is fine to keep running. I would not start running when your pregnant though since your body is not use to it. I walk every day with my puppy to help control my weight.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lilluo lol That was funny. I haven't heard the term 'food baby' in a long time!<br>  <br>  Anyway no running won't kill a baby. I wouldn't recommend doing things you didn't normally do before getting pregnant. =D|`|Fpt3n7Tdaa	maybe! how running you do and how big you pregnancy if you just running like jogging is not kill the baby.|`|U4JNn07waa	Noooo it's very healthy in moderation|`|29gHY4U6aa	No, no no no no.

xvxtQwV5aa	wow, they were a lot of help!  although, you do need to consult a doctor or visit the free clinic. The spotting and dark brown blood can sometimes be an early sign of pregnancy. I got my period, spotting and dark colors, and later found out I was pregnant. The fact that you have this and clotty stuff could be an indication of an upcoming miscarriage, I should know, I've had plenty. <br>  <br>  You say you've had a miscarriage before. Do you remember any of these symptoms? If you're trying to have a baby and are having miscarriages, you need to see a doctor and find out why you are having trouble conceiving. Something may be wrong and you need to find out before it escalates and you have to have your ovaries taken out or something. <br>  <br>  I know you're looking for quick help but when it comes to your health, if something is different or not normal, you should ALWAYS see a doctor. Don't shrug it off and push it to the side. You never know if this is the first signs of a very serious health issue. You don't want to wait until things get worse only to find out it could have been prevented by taking action when the warning symptoms arose. You may not know them to be warning symptoms but a doctor will. <br>  <br>  See a doctor immediately. PLEASE|`|wqQf6IKqaa	I don't know it looks fine........... Get a new keybord if you think ther is somehing wrong with teh way it does periods...|`|g9vw4ovGaa	To me, it sounds like a miscarriage. Those things hurt, alot. Maybe you tested too soon, or some women just get false negatives. Spotting could have been implantation bleeding, and this amount of blood is more than likely a misscarriage and i'm sorry for you loss|`|Z7HHGz7Raa	See a doctor, don't ask people on the internet. Something serious like that should be taken seriously.
pO0s0bhHaa	I'm sorry - I think you may have miscarried.   I had the same thing happen to me.  We were so happy to be pregnant.  And within a week I started spotting and a few days later got a period and then started miscarrying /heavy clots.  It was horrible because the pregnancy test showed up positive still.  I had to get a D and C operation to remove what wasn't miscarried out.  It took 2 weeks after that to finally get a negative test.  We've been trying since this happened back in Sept.  You should go see your doctor to confirmation either way.   Sooo sorry that you're going through this.|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	a period dose not mean you are not pregnant I had mine for 2 months just much lighter and my mother had her period regularly for 5 months into her pregnancy with me. Now if you had a faint positive that means either a false positive or a REAL one. You could very well have been pregnant. I would go to the er right away if possible because of how long this has been happening. If you were pregnant then you may be having a miscarriage and it sounds like if you are, your body is not pushing the baby out and you could get VERY VERY sick. If you for some reason can not get to the ER now I would wake up VERY early tomorrow and call you OBGYN or Doctor and make an emergency appointment and get there fast to make sure you are ok. I hope all is well I could be wrong God bless<br>  tyffannie|`|dSuu7CMZaa	Please take a hpt first thing in the morning.  It sounds as though it's a possible pregnancy, or unfortunately a miscarriage.  Do you chart your bbt?  If so, what do those read?  If you are ttc, I definately recommend reading "Taking Charge of Your Fertility" by Toni Weschler.

Tried stage 3 a couple weeks ago and she gagged, but I want to try again now that she's been getting more grown up food.|`|UfOP3xtcaa	If she has her teeth i would say she is okay.

h1AIzD9baa	the name brand ones are good.... but sometimes the cheaper ones are more sensative and give accurate results earlier and faster.. but even knowing this i am guilty of only buying clear blue digital.. <br>  <br>  as for symptoms.. i had early symptoms like breast tenderness and nausea......

bWyKAFwuaa	It is actually possible for it to be right away!

8t8NjjnVaa	It depends on what you need it for.   <br>  <br>  For occasional pumping, I'd go with the Medela Mini-Electric.  It's what I had and I loved it.<br>  <br>  If you're going back to work or will be pumping a lot for other reasons, then I'd suggest the Medela Pump In Style.  That's the one my sister used when she went back to work...and she had twins.|`|no9N3zjMaa	I use a manual pump but it's avent and  I love it but I've also heard alot of good things about medela is a good brand too|`|VpcT7dUgaa	I like my Medela Swing pump, but if you can afford it, rent a hospital-grade pump. The Medela Symphony is the best.<br>  <br>  I'm tandem-nursing my 2 year-old and my 5 month-old as well as pumping and donating to a local newborn who can't tolerate that crap they call formula. I couldn't do it without a great double pump.|`|xV3e72e1aa	Unfortunately for pumps, you get what you pay for.  I got a decent pump, Lansinoh, for about $150.  However, I could never really get more than 4 oz (total) at a time.  When it became neccesary that I get more than I could with my own pump, I ended up borrowing my friend's Medela Pump in Style.  I got way more.  I think they run about $300, but I am definitely going to splurge and get one of these next time around.|`|fUC4wCCEaa	I used the Lansinoh Double Electric.<br>  It was great!  Especially when my son would skip a meal and I was having let downs.  Worked like a charm.  Plus it is significantly cheaper than the Medela, which I had also used in the hospital, and works just as well.<br>  Good luck on your search!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	That depends on a few factors. One being, do you plan on going back to work and pumping, or jsut pumping at home to store some bottles. Another being your price range. The best one is to rent one from the hospital. But that gets expensive over time.

Lots and lots of diapers so you don't have to go out to get more.  Last thing you want to do is have to go to the store when you have a baby who is feeding every 2 hours and you yourself is beyond sleep deprived.  <br>  <br>  For You:  If you are breastfeeding, lanolin and Medela Hydrogels for nipple discomfort. Lots of super absorbent maxi pads, since you will continue to "bleed" for several days to weeks after the birth.  Lots of jammies so you don't have to do a bunch of laundry after you get spat up on, pee'd on or pooped on.  :) <br>  <br>  These are the things that got me through the first few weeks of my little one being born.  He is now 9 weeks old and doing great!  Congrats on your addition and best of luck to you!|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	Just make sure you have all of your everyday stuff if you don't have anyone around to help you.  You won't want to go to the store with the brandnew baby as soon as you get home because you have no toilet paper, laundry detergent, food...  Otherwise, i wouldn't worry, just ask someone to make a run to get you anything you missed if you think of something later.  Make sure you have some kind of frozen or quick to prepare meals incase you don't feel like cooking and noone brings you food.  Sorry, i can't tell you from experience since i'm only at 18 weeks!  But i hope this helps!|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Sorry about your husband, mine's going to Iraq in September.<br>  A sling, I went with The Peanut Shell, I love it.<br>  Swaddler blankets, Kiddapotamus have the best ones.<br>  A video baby monitor is really useful, we just bought one today for our 3 month old.

A good number of onesies, or a similar alternative.  (True, it's a little tricky to lift onesies over the head if they had a blowout diaper, but that's what I had.  The button-downs in the front are nice, but either I never looked for those, or they weren't as readily available).<br>  <br>  2. Washcloths - personally, I prefer the 100% cotton.  They tend to be thicker than the terrycloth blends, and they were also great for my kids with really sensitive skin/eczema.<br>  <br>  3. paper plates, plastic utensils - don't laugh, but it didn't dawn on me until our 2nd child how wonderful this is!  Then you don't have to worry about doing dishes (or waste water running the dishwasher for only few things).<br>  <br>  4. incontinence pads - I'm not talking maxi pads, but those rectangular incontinence pads that elderly people can use to line their beds or something.  They're usually found in the pharmacy section, along with the other Depends and other incontinence pads.  But don't get the "underwear" or "maxi" kind.  Just those rectangular sheets.  I used them to line my bed in case my water broke (never did for our 3 kids).  I pinned one or two underneath my fitted bedspread.  And then I kept another one in the car along with a towel in case my water broke while driving.  Also, if your water breaks, it may continue to slowly leak/trickle out, so the incontinence pads can come in handy then.  And since my water never broke, we still had use for the pads AFTER the baby came, because whether it's a boy or a girl, they can pee during diaper changes (and even hit me with poop before!!!).  So I just cut one of those pads & half and lined the changing pad on our Pack & Play with it.  In those wee hour changes (or just the fact that you're so sleep deprived), I was grateful to be able to just wrap up the mess & throw it away.<br>  <br>  5. Diapers, at least one pack of newborns and a pack of size 1's - I recommend just one pack of newborns at this point, because depending on the size of your baby, they outgrow them in a week or skip them altogether!  Will you have any help at all?  It is true that it's that much more difficult to "run out" and get anything at all after the baby comes.  So if you won't have any help, I suppose it wouldn't kill you to have more diapers on hand than you might need.<br>  <br>  6. do one load of baby laundry - a "to-do" vs. something to buy, but a good thing to do!  Then you're ready to go when the baby comes home (plus you'll have some clothes ready to bring to the hospital).<br>  <br>  7. I agree with the other suggestion about any household items you might be low on (TP, paper towels, soap, shampoo, garbage bags, etc.) just b/c it is more challenging to get out after the baby comes (plus you may be pretty tired!)<br>  <br>  8. install the infant car seat, if you haven't already.  :)  Oh, and any sunshades, too.<br>  <br>  9. Oh, maxi pads (and/or tampons) - if you have a vaginal birth, you may continue to bleed for a while, so I had a whole range of maxi pads on hand (heavy flow, overnights, regulars... haha).  Even if you prefer tampons, you'll need pads in the beginning b/c you will NOT want to (and shouldn't) be using tampons!<br>  <br>  My heart goes out to you to become a first-time mom while your husband is serving overseas!  I also have a generic hospital packing list that I email to first-time moms, and if you're interested in that, I'm happy to send that to you.  Just email me.
rvBZPIv4aa	Sometimes period cramps can linger, and so can discharge.

Good luck and congratulations!!|`|fPuZGkmsaa	If you are very concerned about it ask your aunt if she would be offended if you used the name. I think that if you have had the name for 4 years then you shouldn't worry about it. I would go for it.|`|KH9pTE7Oaa	I say use it. U can call her Char or Charlie if you wanted?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|uS07WAwcaa	If you had had it for 4 + years then you should totally go for it because you had thought of it forever ago and its not llike you were copying|`|7HxJvbjMaa	That's a shame. But I think you could still use Charlotte if you don't see each other all that much.<br>  Names that sound similar are Violet and Scarlett.|`|AA12274815	I guess it depends on how close you are with your Aunt. Do you think it would hurt her feelings if you named your baby the same as hers?<br>  <br>  You could try asking her what she thought about it.<br>  <br>  Could you use a variation of the name?<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	I wouldn't feel right using a name that someone in my family has already used even if I don't really talk to them or see them.

I know of one family where there are five cousins all named Nicholas, or Nichole|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Yes, I think you can still use the name you picked.

I feel that since you and your husband are heart set on it. The name does not belong to any one person. So I say go a head and be proud of the possibility of little Charlotte or another beautiful baby boy. Do not stress this is a wonderful and joyous happening. Good luck and have fun in the process! :)|`|k8sukeTbaa	Go ahead and use it.  Since you have different surnames and don't see them very often, it won't matter.

Because I only see my uncle once a year, and that is at Christmas. It was completely by accident but both my cousin and my brother have exactly the same first name and middle name. The only name that is different is their last name. Both of them are Maxwell James, Maxwell after our grandfather, and James is the name of our grandfather on our father's side for my brother, whereas it was a filler for my cousin. It is extremely confusing at Christmas, we can't use nicknames because they are the same or middle names. We usually have to say their first and last name.

Seriously, I know I've personally answered a similar question to you like 5 times. Your girlfriend is pregnant and wants you to move in and get a job? Oh how dare she make such demanding requests. Seriously, grow up. If you wanted sex without consequences then you should have been smart enough to use protection.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Why are you loling? You put yourself at risk to becoming a dad by having sex in the first place, so don't put all the blame on her. Take responsibility for your actions and, yes, GET A JOB.

rDlCTXVLaa	No, exercise is safe during pregnancy and encouraged actually. this makes labor easier, and helps u get back into shape faster. If you didn't exercise before, then start slowly, and make sure it's ok with your doctor. drink plenty of water, wear comfy shoes, and stop if u begin to cramp, get to short of breath or have any spotting. Listen to your body, and avoid laying flat on your back, or abdominal exercise after the first trimester.

Do things like the treadmill, stairstepper, legs and arms workouts, pregnancy yoga, or maybe a spin class. Ab workouts are pointless during pregnancy, but after the baby is born I recommend them!|`|24cd5f0b57bd0cb03485550a8be13e35aa	If she's interested in hurting her baby.  She should not be on any kind of machine.  Exercise is great during pregnancy...Low impact cardio but she shouldn't be lifting much weight and should stay off the equipment!!!|`|QczEdd5qaa	Yes<br>  <br>  i suggest you should just run laps but not lift weights|`|MxhJjSgLaa	yes

k3AmV6waaa	As soon as you graduate from highschool, you can find a job and move out. Religion should be of free will not force upon other. If you don't want to be a Mormon then they should not force it on you.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I live in utah home of Mormons, don't know if you do or not. They aren't completely forcing it on you if you aren't going on a mission. I am not Mormon, but I would love to say that if you have abided by all their rules till now don't stop. I think some Mormons are great people. You can still go out and party. Don't completely lose your religion.|`|lfMJPZ67aa	Your parents have done their job and they should have more faith in you and what they have taught you. If they did a good job then you will make the right decisions in life. When it comes to religion you have to decide for your self, just because you where brought up in that religion doesn't mean it's right for you. It's a bit like when you are raised by two racist parents and you hear it all your life and when you become and adult and realise that they where wrong. You don't stay a racist if you don't think its right do you?|`|wZAeBisbaa	Get a job or go to college with the help of financial aid.  When you can afford it, move to a dorm or apartment.  Then you can live the way you choose - as long as you are responsible enough to keep the job or stay in school.  I understand the attraction of friends and parties.   I think it's OK to experience that kind of social life - in moderation and safely.  Be sure to educate yourself about the effects of alcohol and about safe sex before you experiment with these things.  And remember that with adulthood comes responsibility.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	It's your parents house, so it's their rules.  Either live by their rules or find a new place to live. <br>  <br>  That said, you'd probably have a hard time finding a place with one bedroom of your own for less than $150 per month.  To pay $150 in rent, you'll have to earn about $240 (taxes, utilities, etc)  So, 3 hours of church is paying you $80 per hour.  My guess is that that is a pretty good deal for you.  However, if 3 hours on a sunday are worth more than $240 to you, then by all means, move out and do whatever you want.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You need to follow your own path. You need to do what makes you happy. I don't know what your religion entails but throwing your kids into the street for not going to church just seems stupid to me. I thought religions taught you that it is not for  you to judge, only God can do that. You will not be happy in your life doing what others force you to do. Find where you belong and make no apologies for it to anyone.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Generally you need to abide by your parents rules when you live in thier home, even when you are 18 or older (an adult), but whether you go to church or what church or no church is not something they can govern.  You are an adult, move out and live your own life.|`|HUsv9VU9aa	There is nothing wrong with you experimenting. The problems is that with parties comes liquor and girls which leads to sex. Which these things can lead to you gettind drunk and having unsafe sex. This is why this is bad in the bible. But almost everyone has done it except religous people. Some people can live without out and some do it and learn the hard way. Some party and have a real good time and nothing happens but real good memories and this is what you want. And unfortunately your parents don't understand that. What if you move out for a while to experiment and when you think you've had enough move back in because i'm sure you love your religion, but just want to have fun and meet new people.|`|02afccc3abbd7877c182c4b1daa8d2a9aa	Follow your heart but don't totally stop believing in your religion.  You may want to experience other religions.  You can go to parties but it doesn't mean you need to experience everything that happens at these parties (drugs, alcohol, sex, etc).  Take a chance and observe things before actually doing/trying.<br>  I wish your parents could or would try to understand this point of what you want to do.<br>  People will judge you through out your life and the ones that don't are true friends.  What I mean by this comment is, you're a Mormon and your new friend isn't, don't push your religion onto someone else and the same goes for drugs, alcohol etc.  They'll like you for who you are and not what you do.  They'll tell you if something you're doing is something they don't like but they'll still be your friend.<br>  I used to be a Mormon and I couldn't follow all the restriction in the religion.  Good Luck with what ever you choose.
kVBDpAMTaa	You can get pregnant anytime, it is just very unlikely. Ovulation can be anywhere from 6-14 days after or before your period. You do have some symptoms of pregnancy, as those were my first symptoms before I found out. You should take a pregnancy test the day of your next expected period, as that is when they are most accurate. I felt these symptoms very early on, like a week before my expected period, so I would say that you may be but I could very well be wrong. If you are congrats! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
LDYAGJCxaa	No, you can't.  Sperm has an extremely short life-span outside the body....like minutes instead of hours.  If he ejaculated in his jeans, they would have had to live long enough to work their way through his underwear, his jeans, your underwear, into your vagina and then up to the egg.  All of this without any lubrication.  (That's one reason our bodies make lubricant, to help aid the sperm...and that's why a woman's cervical mucus is different while she's ovulating)  <br>  What you're asking just wouldn't be possible.|`|slzx5202aa	I am no trying to be rude, but if you have to ask a question like this perhaps it is wise that you don't engage in intercourse until you have matured a bit. <br>  <br>  No you cannot get pregnant this way. And if you do decide to have sex again, use protection, EVERY TIME.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|XbKmgaKIaa	Yes you can still get pregnant if your boyfriend had an orgasm. Even thoughh you wear underwear or not, the sperm isdetermineded to find the egg ONLY if you are on your period at the time you had "dry sex".|`|P8maveryaa	Is this a serious question?  He was wearing jeans and you think the sperm swam through them and then through your underwear...really...If you are this naive you have NO business even dry humping, let alone god help us if you have sex...|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	If what you say is totally true, then you can't get pregnant.  If you got semen on your hands and then touched inside your undies there is a tiny tiny possibility.|`|4kuWOZowaa	This is why you shouldnt have sex. For questions just like these. Go ask your parents see what they say.
wiAVa1H5aa	I'd be nervous too!   The link below, from the NIH, talks about it and has pictures on what is done exactly.  I hope that is all you need to endure, and make sure the surgeon explains exactly why it needs to be done and how and what you need to do afterwords.

bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	With a past and present like that. I wouldn't let him see his kid at all. Plain and simple. He needs to get his act together or stay out.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Of course he's not fit.  Like anyone is going to reply "Oh yes.  He sounds like a wonderful father".  My only advice is to get a lawyer.  You'll need to testify to all the abuse (a police report would be gold if you ever reported the abuse), you'll need to prove that he's on drugs, an alcoholic, clinically depressed and has ADHD.  If you do all that, you'll be set for life.  You won't have to worry about him at all.|`|CZg79Qy9aa	He's not fit to have a baby.  In court you can request that his visits are supervised by someone from the court.  Tell them your reasons and they will listen to you.|`|3w7VztEWaa	No he's not.|`|AA10951544	i am currently in a similar situation...<br>  <br>  im 18 and have a 3month old baby boy<br>  <br>  my boyfriend (hes also the father of my baby) smokes weed everyday, he gets drunk occasionally without notice, gets violent occasionally too and i suspect he is still engaging in illegal activites...<br>  <br>  currently we are still together, though....he has improved a little and we do have our "good days" together<br>  <br>  BUT...i would NEVER let him take my baby, even for a SECOND without being supervised.<br>  <br>  You and I are old enough to make our own decisions (i think you made a GREAT one by leaving him, i plan to do the same if things dont improve over the course of some months)<br>  <br>  we can at least scream or run or call 911 or SOMETHING...but our babies cannot.<br>  <br>  Im sure that if you explain to the court what you just explained here they will rule in your favor<br>  <br>  people like him are lucky to even be allowed to see their children at all!|`|pO0s0bhHaa	He's absolutely NOT fit to have a baby or be with a baby/child unsupervised.  Sweet girl, PLEASE get on the pill and don't have anymore children for now.  You are soooo young.  This guy is a drug, using, abusive loser!  Don't ever get back together with him and don't get involved with anyone that is abusive or uses drugs.  You HAVE to look out for your baby now and boys/men like this are dangerous to you and your baby!!   God bless and seek help from your church and from services that are out there for you.
AA10015577	It is a lot easier to get pregnant after having a baby, especially not that long ago so there is a large chance that you may be.  If I were you I would have taken a test already so you should do that asap.  Good luck!|`|ZJaby58Vaa	Yes you can, take a test or see a doctor.

5N3odm3Qaa	Here's some truth: it's a gamble. Some mothers smoke during their pregnancy and give birth to babies with asthma while others give birth to perfectly healthy babies.<br>  <br>  The general message is this: don't gamble. In the long run, your health will greatly improve and you can thank your baby for extending your life by what may be decades. They'll thank you, too.<br>  <br>  Either way, it is highly inadvisable to smoke during pregnancy. That baby ingests everything you do. That includes the dozens of carcinogens in both light and regular cigarettes. It takes a small fraction of what it would take an adult to develop all sorts of bronchial maladies and be put at risk for so many illnesses.<br>  <br>  If you absolutely cannot will yourself to stop smoking, seek help ASAP. And don't forget that you can smoke half a cigarette and achieve the same level of nicotine in your system. So no need to flood unnecessarily, right? Just give it your best shot.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Not sure, but why risk it? Smoking is disgusting and bad for YOUR own health (not just the baby's) anyway.|`|0LLGXfCzaa	The chances are slim that it would harm the baby, but if the baby came out with any problem at all, you would always blame yourself for not practicing 100% good prenatal care.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Here's the thing.... if someone smokes so very little, then it should be relatively simple to just stop all together while pregnant.  There's still no reason for them to be smoking (even a tiny bit) while pregnant.  Hell, there's absolutely no reason why anyone should smoke even when they aren't pregnant.  With every single cigarette that a person smokes, they increase their chances of getting cancer and/or causing complications with the pregnancy.  There are NO benefits to smoking.  None.  Its bad for your health, let alone the health of an unborn child.  The absolute best thing is to not smoke at all.  Period.<br>  <br>  *Former smoker who stopped smoking when I decided I wanted to start a family.  Doing everything within my power to help have a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby was more important to me than some personal addiction.  Even if any of them were born with problems, at least I'd know that it wasn't because I smoked or drank or whatever.  Now that I'm a mother, keeping myself as healthy as I can so that I can be there for my children is more important than some personal addiction.  Like I said, there are NO benefits to smoking, so I wised up and just stopped all together.  Happier and healthier because of it.|`|1YdeUn1Caa	My Dr. told me not to quit. Quitting causes stress and will harm the<br>  baby. So I cut back to 5-7 a day. The result. 3 pregnancies, 3 big<br>  and healthy babies. All because I listened to my Dr. His advice<br>  benefited my children.|`|EvXqkrvAaa	If you are having only 3-5 a week then what is the point of taking any risks for such a small amount of nicotine......|`|rGCZaEKOaa	I am not a doctor so I do not know if it is healthy for a baby (I am assuming it's not) but what I don know is that it isn't healthy for you and can lead to many types of harm to your own body. I hope that you can stop smoking even if you aren't pregnant. It is a bad habit.|`|1KqknaUHaa	not good.<br>  <br>  I think you can look up videos on you tube that gives you a visual demenstration of whats happening, i've seen it and it's so mean to do that to your baby.|`|iqHDegiBaa	if you want a downy please smoke. why dont you have a few cocktails while your at it. if you cant quit while your pregnant you shouldn't have kids.|`|AA11256693	Ask yourself if your occasional cigarette is more important than the long term health of your child.|`|QzgkN2LZaa	my husbands sister smoked through both of her pregnancies and they came out fine!! they weight wasnt as normal as it shouldve been|`|s5y6SZhnaa	I am not a doctor. dont f_cking smoke. you will ruin your child.|`|mIlxmNQ8aa	NONE AT ALL|`|bI9m3zvOaa	I smoked around 3 cigarettes a day while pregnant with my son, he was a beautiful healthy 7.8pound baby.<br>  <br>  I believe soking in moderation is not harmful in pregnancy but really i cant say that, its just what i believe.<br>  <br>  I know many people who smoke though pregnancy, and their babys have been perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  But there is ALWAYS the chance, something could go wrong. dont smoke a few ciggies a week if u know u can go without.<br>  <br>  but if its stressing you out, most doctors say its more harmful NOT to smoke.<br>  <br>  <br>  Look at all this mean people. dont listen to em babe. betcha they have never had a smoke in there life.|`|psHaJDa5aa	I smoked once in a while when I needed it when I was pregnant and my baby boy was 7lbs 3 oz. He is 7 months old now and the healthiest baby he can be. He's never been sick, no health problems, nothing. I'm not saying smoking is good for a baby by any means. I know that if you are dependant on cigs and need that to get thru something and have always been like that and you just stop smoking, it will stress you out and stress the baby out. Shoot, I've known some people to smoke pot while they were pregnant or do worse drugs (NOT SAYING ITS OK!). Bottom line... if you need to take the edge off, don't feel guilty... but don't go overboard.|`|BmZFsuZCaa	a cigarette a week is dangerous, nevertheles 3-5 a week. <br>  any nicotine is dangerous so dont do it at all. <br>  you'll regret it in the end, one cigarette a week could make baby dependent on that nicotine. even that little bit, because the baby gets everything you get, but baby is much smaller and so it affects it seriously<br>  so NO!|`|uuaapqOeaa	Why would you even bother?

kRaVa0Wraa	In silence he ran his cold eyes over the written words. He said nothing.<br>  (indent here) "Shall I go, Armand?" She asked in tones sharp with agonized suspense. "Do you want me to go?"<br>  (indent here) "Yes, I want you to go."<br>   Desiree takes her child and leaves. She was never seen again. Armand burns all of her belongings and finds a letter from his mother saying that he was the one that carried the black gene, because his father was black. “Moreover [Armand] no longer loved her, because of the unconscious injury she had brought upon his home and his name." (cite this from the book.) Armand wasn’t even aware of his own race when he acted like that. He ended up losing his wife and his baby all because he was racist and couldn’t live to that fact that Desiree could have been black.

3F8f1SoQaa	I know it sounds crazy...but I think the pp is correct and that your son may actually LIKE to be "caged". I am sure that you already know this, but things that are distasteful and irritating to typical kids can be very comforting to children with autism. Why not go out and buy a play tent ( one of those irritating plastic ones) in his favorite character? Put his toddler bed in it and see what happens. If all else fails you may want to put him back in the crib, but leave the side down so he can climb in and out of it safely. wait 6 months or so, then try again with the toddler bed.|`|2Hhbz16maa	My niece is autistic and would never sleep in a bed. My brother ended up getting her a big tent and putting a mattress in there. She loves it. Goes to bed on her own and love the confinement a tent brings but is not caged up.|`|QUA9EaZQaa	Because he's autistic it will take him longer to get used to new things. Be supportive of his needs, maybe lay with him for awhile.  Let him choose which bed to sleep in.  Just reassure him that you will be there for him.|`|pat5nYZYaa	Mabey your 3 yr old is scared to slee p alone ask him and if he is stay in there with him until he falls asleep mabey that will work|`|53o0Z2Xvaa	family therapy, since he's autistic you need to give him special treatments for his needs.|`|u8uWowbTaa	First I want to say that I really feel for you.  It is so difficult dealing with sleep issues, especially because it means that you are getting less sleep.  Everything seems magnified at night when you are lacking sleep and all you want to do is crawl back in bed.  <br>  I would say just to be VERY consistent with whatever you decide to do.  If it were me I would keep putting him back in bed and IGNORE the toys and throwing clothes (I know that is hard) because I think not giving a reaction to that is best, especially at night.  If you react to that at night, you will be prolonging the experience of him (and you!) being out of bed and interacting during sleep hours. <br>  I would stand there and just put him back in bed over and over and over again with as little reaction as possible, telling him "no, this is night time and we sleep at night time".  I know your child is autistic and I am sure that makes it harder but I just don't think anything else will work.  The first time you try this, it may seem like pure hell and it may take ALL of your patience and tolerance, but what do you have to lose?<br>  I wish you the BEST of luck!

So you will have to ask someone to get them for you and check out with them.  <br>  <br>  If you're too nervous to buy them then, you're too young to be having sex.<br>  If you're cannot financially support a child, you're too young to be having sex.<br>  If you're not ready to accept that with sex you are at risk for STDs (some of which are for life or can kill you) and pregnancy, you're too young to be having sex.<br>  <br>  Mom and birth control:  Take you're mom up on the offer.  Use you're own birth control and condoms both.  Don't trust that you really are his first.<br>  It's great that she's trying to have open communications with you.  Try and respect her and realize that while she's trying to support you as you grow up, that you are still her baby and would probably prefer you to wait.

776143369bb290accd3ea9aa251e66c9aa	When a baby can easily roll both ways, it's ok to let them sleep in whatever position they're comfortable.  He's just going to roll onto his tummy as soon as you leave the room anyway.  Just make sure there's no loose bedding/pillows/puffy blankets... you know the drill.<br>  <br>  I nearly went crazy trying to get my daughter (she was around 6 mos) to sleep on her back, but she was intent on rolling onto her belly.  Obviously nothing came of it.  She's 14 mos. now and still sleeps on her face.|`|pXSKSS3daa	If your baby is rolling both ways consistently, which it sounds like he is, then the risk of SIDS is decreased. If he likes sleeping on his belly better then let him. I know it's hard not to worry but I'm sure you're tired checking on him so often during the night!|`|u94HOVz7aa	once they can roll themelves its ok to let them sleep how they want just start the  night and naps on their back were they move themsevles from there is ok.  the problem before they can roll is they are not strong enough to move their faces if it gets covered or smashed into matress. they say once they can roll over on their own  it is no longer a risk.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	1-4 is when babies are at the greatest risk of SIDS. Once a baby can roll from front to back, they should be able to move their heads if they have trouble breathing for some reason. My son started rolling over because he preferred to sleep on his tummy. My husband and I both worried all the time for the longest time about SIDS. We just checked on him, a lot, and made sure he didn't have his face pressed into the side of the crib and gave him no blankets when he slept.|`|TJezsCkHaa	Put those round pillows on each side of his body,but doctors say that they are in risk as well on there back because they may choke.I used to put mine with there back against the crib and put a round pillow besides his belly_as if he is hugging the pillow-but away from his face.Try that but keep checking making sure he is fine .|`|JRXpYW3Naa	We'll the biggest danger zone is 2-4 months, and he's five months, so he's out of that. But there is still a risk until he's a year. I know how you feel about SIDS. It scares me to death. My husband had a brother pass away from it, so I'm always checking on the baby as she sleeps. I would say put him down on his back, and if he rolls over, let him be.
YUNE5QReaa	Try doing a test or booking in to see your DR, it depends on what your period is usually like.  I would talk to my Dr tho, just to see if everything is ok.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say you could be pregnant coz you would have other symptoms other then not having your period in 3 days, but you never know|`|NNwEuC8paa	yes! take a test first thing in the am good luck|`|dSobv28maa	Possibly.<br>  Implantation bleeding.|`|Q7ATGTCsaa	It is very possible that you are, but it's also possible that if you are stressing about it, you're just holding off your period.

92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	With both of my pregnancies so far (but the second one ended in miscarriage at 5.6 weeks along), I did not get a positive hpt until 16DPO.   However, my signs started earlier than that.  With my first full-term pregnancy, I had a lot of fatigue by 10 DPO (I was falling asleep on floor on our living room without a pillow or blanket - highly unusual for me), some light cramping by about 5 DPO, and lots and lots of bloating/gas very early on (and some related nausea about 5 DPO, also), and even some congestion that seemed vaguely like allergies or a cold starting, but wasn't.   I was not constipated or diahhea, either.  I was highly normal in regards to my bowel.    <br>  <br>  With my second ill-fated pregnancy, I was very dizzy every day from two days after ovulation, and I was nauseous by about 12 DPO (but still didn't get a positive Hpt until 16 DPO).   I was again bloated and gassy, but bowels were fine..  After I got my BFP, within a few days, my mouth tasted very metallic, and I was having morning sickness, which stopped suddenly one day, and then I started spotting and cramping.  I miscarried right then, suddenly.  <br>  <br>  I am in my 2ww again now.   I am 8 DPO, and in the last three days I have been experiencing some diarrhea with a little cramping, a bit of lightheadedness but the severe dizziness of December, and some light cramping/tugging. I have a little bit of nausea at times, and suddenly today, I have had trouble staying awake.  Over night last night, I slept over 9 hours, then I took a two hour nap a mere three hours later, and I am going to go to bed again very soon for the night.  I don't know normally take naps or even need naps -- (Unless I am sick or pregnant.)  Some of these things I mention because I don't normally get diarrhea (I tend toward constipation if anything), and the need of naps is highly unsual for me.   I also have breast soreness and pain, but I sometimes get that on cycles I am not trying to get pregnant, too, so I can't really count it as a sign.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I had no symptoms when I tested and got a positive (8 dpo!), but later that week the sore breasts, cramping, tiredness and bloating really kicked in.|`|uuaapqOeaa	I'm wondering the same thing! I have all of the same, except thirst. <br>  <br>  Thanks! :)|`|Fwm6lHmpaa	i was 6 weeks and started gettind sick|`|QSodlfMraa	missed period go the test a 2 weeks after that.|`|dPULl5hjaa	2 days from my missed "monthly"
U4JNn07waa	I'm 20 weeks with my first and yes it is normal to an extent. The cramping is from your stomach stretching making room for the baby and the dizziness is from increased blood flow..Try keeping snacks around to eat if you start to feel really dizzy and a heating pad will help for cramps..If you feel the pain is really bad discuss it with your doctor..<br>  Also try to talk to your boss about being able to sit more or try and look for another job that will accommodate your needs during pregnancy|`|Fpt3n7Tdaa	that is normal for pregnant women.do you take vitamin for pregnant women. that help you get better.|`|1KDNlPGdaa	www.huggies.com.au<br>  <br>  very informative and talks you through everything and why some things happen.
KeevlZnTaa	I would suggest that you keep sending him away from you when he hits. If he comes back to hit you, then you need to stand him up, face him away from you and tell him to walk away. He will soon learn that hitting gets him nothing positive, he just loses time with you.<br>  <br>  If he is a more sensitive child, or you don't want to use punishment, you could try showing him what he should be doing. For example, when he hits you, stick to the firm "No", and "we don't hit, hitting hurts" Make sure your face reflects that you are angry, children read faces easier than words(be sure to exaggerate your facial expression). Take his hands in yours(make your facial expression more gentle), have him stroke where he hit you and tell him "be gentle with moma." continue to show him how to have gentle hands. When you do this smile and let him know how happy you are when he is gentle. "Mommy loves it when you give gentle touches" Make sure you have a big smile, and look happy. Children love to please, so if he is getting positive attention, he may change the behavior. It also teaches him how you want to be touched (gently, not hit). <br>  <br>  Also do this when he hits his brother, and make sure you are giving his brother words to show displeasure with being hit. The older brother should tell the younger brother "I don't like that." It is a good way to promote communication and give children the words to deal with some of their own problems independently.|`|a7pgX1W8aa	I went though something very similar with my kids. My first son was so gentle and my second son was a hitter. What I did is when he would hit me or kick me I would tell him no hands are not for hitting and/or feet are not for kicking. Then I would take a chair that was his size put it in the corner and make him sit on his hands for two minutes if he hit me or kicked me. He really hated sitting on his hands, so eventually he got the point after I kept doing it consistently and stopped the hitting and kicking. Maybe this could work for you. Hope this helps.|`|3X8Igzhxaa	i would be asking myself where did he learn to do this does he go to a preschool most of those things are picked up at school no matter what age they are maybe hes being hit at school u have to watch without anyone knowing that your watching i did and what i saw made my hair stand up and i pulled my daughter out immediately otherwise if its not school then go see a baby doctor|`|eya1WDS4aa	He keeps doing it because you dont do anything to stop him, from what it sounds like you dont discipline him at all. Start disciplining this could help.|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Ok here is what you should do. You may hate me for this. But trust me! This is really helpful. My little brother is the same way, when he was that age, and my mom got him good. <br>  <br>  Anyway here is what you should do. SMACK HIM!!! Don't be scared to do this also.  If he wants to hit , punch , bite or do whatever to you. Then you...<br>  <br>  1. Look right into his eyes.... Give him a mean look!<br>  <br>  2. Tell him a STRONG, and SERIORS voice. ( But NEVER use DONT! Because of what I learn. Don't is a word, that is kinda hard for kids, there age to understand. ) So instead of saying don't....Say..." Keep your hands <br>  and feet  to your self" Or grab his arms, or feet and say that also.<br>   <br>  3. If he still at it.......SMACK HIM. You can eather use your hands, or you can grab out a stick! ....But since he is still so small .... Its best you use your hands. Stick or any other things...is more for older kids. Like 6 and up! <br>  <br>  4. And how to smack him is......Don't hit him, like your going to abuse the child. Only hit him...where is enough to bring out tears and not a mark on his body. ....(you dont wanna get in trouble with cps) So becarful of how to smack and NOT REALLY SMACK. ...Get what im saying?? <br>  <br>  5. After you did that. Send him to his room, or put a chair near the wall and have him sit there for a few mins. Don't turn your back at all. Just stay there and watch him, make sure he dont move. .....But make it clear first. Tell him with a strong voice......." IF I SEE YOU MOVE, YOUR GOING TO GET SMACK AGAIN"  ....Make your voice that where he knows whos boss. <br>  <br>  Trust me.....stuff like that never goes wrong. That's how kids will know next time not to act so awful. .... Because onces they get it, and there use to stuff like that. They learn of how to act right around there parents. ....Your child may get mad at you for the first few mins. But when he is calm, he will love you again. <br>  But your child WILL learn of whats right and wrong. ......SO GO AHEAD. GET OFF THAT COMPUTER AND GIVE IT TO HIM...........Hope this helps good luck|`|PrxlHUT5aa	have that all commanding booming authoritative voice... he might get the idea.  let him throw a fit after you have reprimanded him.  he should learn that he won't get what he wants and it won't make hitting ok even if he breaks down.  that's far better than smacking him back whenever he hits you or his elder bro.  take his hands and sit him and let him think his bad behavior over.  he seems strong willed compared to his elder bro, but every child is different despite the fact that they came from the same set of parents and the same parenting techniques used upon them.  show your approval when he is behaving.

You need your freedom to do what you feel you should be able to do, but there are others in the house that do not agree. It's hard, but until you have your own home, you will have to respect the wishes of the others in the house. Compromise by doing this when others are not around. If your mother is open to talking, discuss it with her and see if she will respect you as well and give you times when you are able to do as you wish. I can see where you are both coming from, and I am afraid that, as I said, you will most likely have to wait until you have your own place before you are able to do this all the time as you wish.|`|9ESlbo4vaa	HAHAHA I CANT HELP BUT LAUGH.<br>  <br>  just walk around naked in your room. <br>  and when your mom's out just run around and have a blast.<br>  dont ask her to do it when she's here, its gross and might lead to incest. <br>  <br>  (jk for the incest part,but your a teen guy your mom cant see you naked)|`|xOVPJRgaaa	i dont quite understand y u wud want to, but its youre parents house you have to respect the fact that they might not want to see u naked in their home.|`|03a6Kb3Vaa	your mom does not want to see you naked<br>  and if she does theres something wrong with her|`|YhYSZlroaa	Tell her you do it when you are alone in the house and see how she reacts|`|q34vCB3Qaa	just do it when no1 is home :P|`|m2MVPh1oaa	carefully do that man!

2daebb3597a4356f1b883fea4d41414eaa	Do not use diaper wipes on his bootie... use wet napkins or tissues or paper towel or a washcloth (something other than diaper wipes because they include alcohol).  When the booties is completely dry, slather A&D ointment all over before putting on the diaper.  If you can, let him wander around without a diaper to air dry.  That should clear up the rash within a couple days. <br>  <br>  For the teething, try Infant Tylenol and Hylands teething tablets.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck ma ma!|`|SDjrojZXaa	I use borduex butt paste and that seems to do well but if it is to the point where it is causing pain i would get a perscription cream to try to clear it up sooner.|`|u94HOVz7aa	i am not sure what brand diapers you use, but i would stick to name brand as they are more sensitive for there skin.  my babies always get a rash from generics and it was exceptionaly bad when they were teething.  also "butt paste" is AWSOME for those rashes.  something my dr. would do for me is prescribe a homemade diaper rash cream.  (with a prescription my insurance would pay for ingredience)  mix equal parts neosporin, hydrocordizone cream and zinc oxcide (desitin) mix throughly and apply to rash as needed.  best thing i ever used.  butt paste worked second best to that.  and the corn starch worked great too, i use that every diaper change period.  but i use it in baby powder (i just make sure its 100% pure corn starch not talc)<br>  <br>  oh ya and rinse out your baby wipe before useing them (i do the whole package at the same time then place in container) there is stuff on the wipes than can irritate little tooshies, expecially when they have a rash.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	My daughter gets a really bad diaper rash when she is teething too.

And I don't leave a nappy on for more than 3 hours when he has nappy rash.<br>  <br>  I am glad that you mentioned how your son got his teeth, my son has the same teeth in the exact same spots.

1ac29c0f1a9a7cbbe46f018e5f6d0f7faa	If your last period was a little lighter or shorter in duration than usual, you might have been having implantation bleeding rather than a regular menstural period. If that's what it was,  a urine pregnancy test would likely be positive now. Worth a try. <br>  <br>  Also, it wouldn't hurt to abstain from drinking and smoking until you're sure you aren't (or are) pregnant.<br>  <br>  About all the symptoms you mentioned, even if you have just experienced implantation bleeding, it may or may not be too early to be having symptoms of pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of fluids if you're urinating frequently and having headaches. You might feel better with a little hydration! Talk to your PCP.|`|eCaLnoSiaa	Either way you're going to end up taking a pregnancy test. Sorry but yahoo answers can't help you|`|7jdvcrTKaa	It could be possible since it has been shown that some women may have their AF during their first trimester.  If I was you I would wait about a week and then take a HPT. Make sure to take it with first morning urine. If it comes out negative, wait until it is time for you next cycle and test again.  If you are still not feeling yourself, go to the doctor and ask for a blood test just in case you have not built up enough HCG in your system for a urine test.  As for the smoking and drinking, just stop long enough to find out whether you are preggers or not.  Right now, it is still early in the developmental stages so the smoking and drinking have yet to really effect the baby if there is one.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Take a test.  If it's negative, test again in a week or so.  Until then treat yourself as if you are pregnant.  Occasional smoking and drinking obviously aren't as bad as regular smoking and drinking, but those aren't good habits anyway, right?  The less the better.<br>  <br>  Stop stressing, it won't help, and it could hurt the baby if there is one.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	There is always a chance that your period was just spotting.

It can never hurt to take a test...but you should let the guy know that you feel like something MAY be up, that way you can come up with the best possible solution for you.<br>  <br>  obviously, drinking and smoking are no good, and if you plan on waiting, your next period is in less than a month anyway, it shouldn't be too hard to cut down on that for a while.<br>  <br>  again nothing is guaranteed, but there's nothing wrong with getting a test. i hope everything works out for you though.
8t8NjjnVaa	Your body is trying to tell you something.|`|Ddb5821Jaa	Your body is making milk for your baby, you will continue till it dries up.  Why not try and Breastfeed. even 3 meals a day (breakfast lunch bed) will give so many benefits to your little one!|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	It's normal. Your body is reacting to your baby's touch and sound and it is producing milk to soothe your baby. Try wearing a tight fitting bra, sleep on your chest, and consume more mint, parsley, thyme, and caffeine. These are all things that can reduce and possibly deplete your milk supply. Try not to relieve the milk by squirting or squeezing. This will alert your body that it needs to make more.|`|24f969b02a5ea25351be932405126b28aa	yes it is very normal. it doesn't matter that you didn't breast feed its just something that every women has. my one breast still leaks every once in a while and my son is 8 months. Every person is different with when they dry up. with my first baby i was dried up after 3 months, but yes it is normal. some advice don't wear anything tight on your breasts because it will squeeze them and make them leak more. they will dry up after time. if you want it to dry up dont let you nipples be under water and try not to stimulate them or squeeze them.|`|AA11256693	Why not give it a try?<br>  It's nearly free, doesn't need warming up or mixing in the middle of the night, you don't have to drag stuff around with you during the day or worry about some chinese poison in formula. Plus, it makes you and her healthier.|`|CmSpH1ANaa	There's a pill that helps dry it up. Ask your doctor. <br>  <br>  My wife never breastfeeds. It's actually very painful, not as healthy as people make it sounds, and you can't do it if you're on various medications.  Don't listen to these people. :)|`|46ijdaH6aa	Yes, it's absolutely normal. I STILL have very little breast milk every now and then and my son is FOUR year old. It can happen =]]|`|hcwp2mAyaa	sounds like you haven't dried your milk up
Tebw0VOdaa	I would definatly call the doctor, but I will say this.  My daughter had a terrible time with teething. Barley ate, loose bowel movements, Sleep patterns were disrupted she just seemed generally sick. I took her to the doctor though and it turned out to be that! Hopefully she is just teething or something.  Go to the doctor for relief for your daughter and piece of mind for yourself!|`|W3lMQAGJaa	My first thought was to make sure her airways are clear by using saline nose spray and the aspirator to clear her nose.  I find by holding down the opposite side of the nose when you aspirate gets a better result.  My 6 month old has choked when eating and clearing the nose helped a lot.|`|Ve0Wl3QNaa	She is probably having a reaction to the shots. If she has a temp give her baby tylenol and call the doctor. Baby usually act differently after they get their shots. If it persist then call the doctor. Good luck. I hope she feels better!|`|46ijdaH6aa	This definitely is not a phase. I would take her to the doctor, or ER right now!! Seems like something is wrong. Don't waste anymore time, babies don't take much for something to go terminally wrong.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	I'd call a doctor to see if she had a reaction to the shots or if she is sick with something,|`|qXk29vRsaa	shes logo|`|SDjrojZXaa	chances are all the factors combined are just making her uncomforable and and she could have some drainage in the back of her throwt causing her to choke however the looking in to space is what concerns me I think i would call the doctor just to be safe. you need to rule out a reaction to the shots.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	I would definitly call your doctor and get a second opinion just in case. I have had my doctors tell me "oh its fine" but I insist on further testing and I am right! Mommys know their babies and if you think something is wrong, insist it get checked thoroughly and don't let anyone make you feel crazy! Good luck!|`|rdpZrBc9aa	Call the doctor.  It's probably just that she's stopped up, but it's always best to check.  That's what they get the big bucks for!  If you live near a big city, check and see if there's an after-hours clinic there you could take the baby to.  They're much faster and cheaper than the ER, and available evenings and weekends when regular doctors are closed.  <br>  <br>  You might want to have her sleep in her car seat to help her sinuses drain.|`|oem5yEUDaa	It sounds like she is very ill. It sounds like she may be choking because her nose is clogged and she can't breath while she is eating. You need to take her to a doctor. If a reaction to an injection last more than 48 hours, she needs to see a doctor. If diarrhea last more than 24 hours, she needs to see a doctor.|`|AA10526033	I doubt its from the shots it could be from teething and she could be getting a cold. I'd call the dr in the morning and have her checked out.<br>  <br>  LOL just read some other answers your daughter WILL NOT become autistic due to the shots that has been proven once and for all as false. A LOT worse will happen if your child doesn't get shots!|`|5b3cd64667a391942de231867c44d64caa	Sounds like she's a bit crook. Take her to the doc just to be sure. NT sounds pretty autistic herself, by the way.
28WJwHf4aa	You should be using your first morning urine as the HcG levels will be more concentrated.<br>  <br>  Test in another week if the period doesn't show. Keep in mind that sore breasts are also signs of a period coming. Stress can cause a period to be late.|`|GLJkGgloaa	Every women and Every Pregnancy story is different.<br>  I tested Positive 5 days before my missed period.|`|W1p6LetFaa	It's possible you are testing too early but who knows.  I didn't get my first positive test until I was 5 days late for my period, and it was so faint that I thought it was a negative at first.  I didn't get a CLEAR positive until 6 days after my period was due.  Keep testing if that period doesn't come.  Best wishes!!|`|JBsilBYXaa	are you taking the test with first morning urine?  Sometimes it can take a few extra days for the HCG hormone to build up enough to show a positive test.  Good luck.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	You're testing too early and not using your first morning urine.  Wait a week and test again.|`|AA10526033	too early. boobs hurting could be period coming. wait awhile longer|`|9d99924ae7cd2add40a289bc1930a1b4aa	sore boobs are also sign of ur period,, but who knows,,, wait like a weeks or so then take another test,,, good luckk<br>  <br>  answer my Q plz<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuUQulozG13uzJv0WQySZobsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222201641AAg4mTB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ppVT5QC7aa	Could be both. Just wishful thinking, the mind has ways of making you feel things that are not there.
1RwZZ2aPaa	If you are really worried go to the website www.kids-in-mind.com. Someone talked about it on here and I checked it out. Really good website. Tells you how much nudity, violence, swearing and drinking/smoking are used in the films.|`|dN5BJeVpaa	I think it's suitable.<br>  There are a few parts, like the beginning, and parts near the end - but otherwise it's completely suitable.<br>  It's a really good movie.<br>  Maybe have her go up and get popcorn in the beginning or something.<br>  <br>  She might be 11, but she's not oblivious to what's happening in the world. She knows what a virgin is, she understands the concepts of a prostitute, and she knows that people get killed because of religion. <br>  There's just some concepts she might not get - but they're not inapropriate.|`|uYddnWYCaa	yes it is completely appropriate because the kids in america need to understand how fortunate they are to have a nice life. Your sister also can understand how the movie is about optimism and love. she might not understand the entire thing, but something will go off inside of her that has a message.|`|44L5fGWLaa	I think you should watch this movie with  the family.  Because there is nothing shown in the movie to get addictive to the bad things. Everything in this movie turns to positive always. So there is nothing to be affraid off. Just watch and enjoy the life of Jamal...... its inspirational. <br>  <br>  And I thinks after watching this movie you will come closer to the grace of the god. As Jamal said, God is Great !|`|NjXdkwUiaa	Its not too violent but its inappropriate because its storyline is really deep and moving, and effect lost on 11 year olds. Actually it i violent because people get burnt alive at the start and a kids mum gets killed with a stick, DONT LET THE CHILD WATCH IT!!!|`|t2YNRxOKaa	i think that its fine. its graphic and there are parts that i was like WHOA (im 14) but i think it would be good for your sister to see how other people are living and see how lucky she is. so i think its fine.|`|Rz4v9Ohvaa	i think no.. because some part of the film shot in red ight area.. hence not.. here is the oscar winners list... and slumdog millionaire bags 8 awards|`|JjBIDCKvaa	Nooooo. Rated R and very disturbing in some parts|`|3Vcq08BHaa	I took my 11 year old son today to see this movie. He really liked the movie. Yes there is violence, but then there is violence everyday all around us on t.v, video games, schools, etc. The only difference was he was watching it on the screen today and not hearing about it on the news or from a friend in school. He left there today telling me how much he loved me, appreciated our home and everything he has. It is an excellent movie, an eye opener on what is happening in other parts of the world and I left there with a greater respect for all humanity. I recommend this movie to all people no matter what their age, religion, or ethnicity is. But if you still doubt, then I recommend you see the movie first with both your parents and then form your opinion if you beleive it is suitable or not. Its really up to both of your parents to reach this decision together.|`|AA11917351	It is good to see that you people are worried about your 11 year old sis.<br>  basically see, this is quite a realistic movie, something that is not at all new to the kids growing up in India. All children do not get a very privileged life, especially not in a country whose population is more than a million. Yes, there may be some scenes of violence, but common, violence is every were round us. Aren't shooting in school a violence??? well u have my answer. Sometimes ignorance is not so much a bliss. So go forward and take your sister to the movie, and help her understand what is happening and why. Protecting someone is good, but too much protection from the real world can be harmful.|`|Lw7exIy4aa	Yes, but only if your parents can explain her what is happening in the right way, meaning what is wrong, what is good, what is bad, why did this and that happen.........in such a case this will be an excellent movie from moral point of view.|`|j7oya7qzaa	It's rated R, but it doesn't have too much violence and an 11 year probably can't understand half the swear words. My 7 year old brother watch it, and he didn't think it was scary or anything.|`|DzUBMdx3aa	yes its fine<br>  she will learn some true facts|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	I dont think so.  Its how graphic the violence is.  I think the positive thing about it, is really seeing how other people, other children live, but believe 11 is too early for how graphic the movie is.  We had 4 adults walk out of it, at those violent parts, before really getting into the film.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	yes its fine.<br>  just cover her eyes during the torture scenes.|`|7BkkZo9Kaa	I saw it and im 11. The important thing is your muturity level not your age. There is some violence but it is not really graphic it just touches on it a bit. But there is some mention of prostitution, and there is only a bit of cursing, and some drinking but nothing to be concerned about. I think you could bring your little sister plus there is a happy ending with a dancing scene at the end. It was a really good movie but you may have to explain some things to her. Enjoy the awsome movie.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the spelling errors<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped. Sorry If I Didnt|`|2H6j4j8taa	It's absolutely  fine. My 12 year old sister watched it and she was fine and loved it. It's good for younger people to be watching intelligent films instead of the usual garbage shown at the movies. She can just cover her eyes if there is anything too inappropriate.<br>  <br>  It's won 8 Oscars so far today. That's a good sign...|`|7MKmxkjlaa	I dno ... i think it would be good for an 11 year old to see how other could live nad how lucky she is ... but then again my parents didn't put any restirctions on the movies i watched ... not really anyways.

Ddb5821Jaa	Tell your daughter that it is a very rough time at first!  I had a heck of a time but I am still breastfeeding at 4months.  I naturally have inverted nipples,( they wont stand erect allowing ease for baby to find and suckle)) Plus, I tried to induce using a mechanical breast pump, which made my nipples cracked and they bled at each feeding.  THEN i acquired scabs on my nipples, which then lead to SORENESS and pain for a whole week while waiting for my milk to come in.  I couldn't shower, the water hurt my nipples so much!  So baby did not learn how to latch properly till week 2. by then i was so distraught in fear of not being able to "feed my baby". Plus lack of sleep and crying all threw out the night!!!<br>  Finally, i used Lanolin on my scabs on my nipples, which sped the healing process. I spent a lot of time topless with my baby, to that he would feel comfortable to nurse at any time. And I tried lots of positions.  at the most painful points of that first week, I would have to lay my baby down on a hard surface, and lay over him to feed him. less suckling was needed due to gravity.  Also I acquired a Manuel breast pump, where I could CONTROL the speed, which allowed me to get my nips more erect before trying to feed.  It didn't feel more 'natural' till week 3.<br>  She just needs support, its not as easy for everyone as it seems. It is something baby has to learn as well as mom!  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I don't know much about formula, but if her nipples are sore make sure she is using a lanolin cream on them every time she feeds (unless she's allergic to wool). A lot of hospitals don't tell mom's about lanolin until their nipples are already cracked and sore but if you use it after every feed it helps to prevent it from getting bad. It shouldn't hurt for more then about a week as long as baby has a decent latch, the lactation consultant should be able to help with that. And it will get better when her milk comes in, then it only stings for a millisecond until the let down happens then you don't feel it anymore. <br>  <br>  Not being a breast feeding freak here, just want her to know what might help. I almost gave up with my first because it hurt so much and I was young (20) and didn't have much support other than my mom who had never breast fed.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	If her breastfeeding does come to an end, just be sure to tell her that there is organic formula out there (if she's into the organic/natural thing).  It took me a while to find that out after 6 months of breastfeeding.  You can get it at Babies or Toys R US.  It's called Earth's Best Organic Formula and they have it in dairy or soy.  We use it and I (and my daughter) both love it.  <br>  <br>  Good for her for breastfeeding, it may start out a little bit rough, but her little one will get the hang of it in no time.  My heart goes out to her, as we all mothers know what an overwhelming experience having a baby is.  And congrats!
F8KmTbqjaa	I second the towel suggestion, and you could try sticking them (the towel not the babies LOL : ) in the freezer for 15 minutes.  My daughter loved that while teething.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  HAHAHA im a little wow right now!  Its late...........but im sure you could use a laugh with TWO teething babies, one was enough for me!!!!!!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Try letting them suck on a cold rag.|`|jNErU39iaa	As the other two suggested, the cold face washer will help. Also, have you got any teething rings? You can put those (or your babies pacifiers) in the freezer until they are nice and cold and let them chew and suck on those.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow, buy the Oragel, and also some teething rusks (they look a little like breadsticks) but are impossible for the baby to bite through, they work a treat! Good Luck =]|`|8yTP3jO8aa	Teething isn't actually supposed to be painful, just uncomfortable.  What about some sort of calming distraction to help them fall asleep?  Maybe playing some soft classical music?  Reading some stories?  Turning on a soft light and the tv set to low volume and laying down in the living room?  A feed can help, especially if they're bottle fed and they can chew on the nipples.<br>  <br>  Pure vanilla extract can help numb the gums a bit if you use a few drops.  Imitation vanilla doesn't have the same effect, though.|`|cBwdYXtmaa	Hi, so when my nephew was teething we gave him an all natural popsicle and just let him suck on it. :p it was messy, but it worked.<br>  Orajel worked too, so just get some tomorrow! Or... I guess... today.|`|zGdyJbYUaa	If you have frozen waffles put one in there mouths to chew and suck on. I saw this once on t.v. hope it helps|`|a03b0b5014fce6dc67440fe39f59a44aaa	get 2 wash clothes and run ice cold water on them ring them out and give them to the babies they can suck and chew on and and when they pull it out of there mouth it will rub up against there gums it will feel soothing to them.|`|FAmOvyFYaa	Hi i agree with above and a cold facewasher (a clean one!lol) should do the trick tonight,<br>  I have 6 month old twins,arent they just the best?!! :)<br>  Good luck with tonight!
jhBRNvIxaa	You can breastfeed on it but <br>  <br>  "has not been released for use as a stimulant for milk production. This does not mean that it cannot be prescribed for this reason, but rather that the manufacturer does not back its use for increasing milk production. However, there are several studies which show that it works to increase milk production and that it is safe."<br>  <br>  Got that from a website... I am not going to give you a negative comment cause at least you tried to breastfeed!<br>  <br>  to person above...No not all perscribtion drugs are bad! Thanks to those drugs I am still alive to care for my children! Thanks for the comment though!<br>  <br>  I started off breastfeeding my son but I had to use a shield cause he wasn't latching on and it was putting a lot of stress on him not getting enough milk so he did have suppliment formula. but I am lucky that my daughter has had no problems breastfeeding.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	You may want to ask in Newborn, but I wanted to say- There's nothing wrong with formula. Some people are so mean. I was a formula feed baby and I have a scholarship to college. Thank you breast feeding nazis!|`|xubIaiZaaa	have you tried googling the drug and its symptoms? or try asking your chemist. i really dont think i'd trust anyone on here when it comes to medicines.<br>  <br>  on the formula issue, you had to do what you had to do, i'm not judging!|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	all prescription drugs are bad for you....seek alternative methods|`|gT31DB1caa	yes that is exactly what is causing it when i was having probs establishing my milk supply with my first son that is what my dr called in for me to take to increase my milk supply but it didn't make enough to fill him up so i had to change to formula. and i am right there with you on the not wanting to hear the formula=poison bs because with my second child i breastfed him everyday of his life and that is supposed to protect him from childhood diseases well we burried him at 3 months old cause of death menengitis. anyway though yeah it is that medicine causing your probs
5ZvALiclaa	If people can't come together amicably for your sisters shower then they shouldn't be there. If they start bi**ching and moaning tell them to 'grow up, its not about you its about "insert sisters name" and if you don't like it you don't have to come / you can leave, but you will be disappointing "sisters name"....<br>  <br>  <br>  some people just need to be told off and told to act mature and grow up!! Who cares if they are pissed, your having it there and thats that!!!|`|vsFJZRkGaa	it sounds great.<br>  <br>  discretly mention to the feuding family members before the event that if they are going to start anything or make snide remarks you would prefer they opt out of attending.<br>  explain that the baby shower is for a emotional, sensitive pregnant woman who deserves a peaceful and enjoyable day.<br>  <br>  hopefully everyone will be on their best behaviour. If they start anything, ask to speak to them outside and then ask them to vacate the shower as their behaviour was appalling.|`|pXSKSS3daa	There are spaces available to rent. Check your local churches or halls and see what their prices would be.|`|9DtJeAUKaa	First, don't give out personal info. online like the location. You never know...<br>  <br>  Second, you should have it where you NEED to & CAN. Others will adapt & if not, ignore them & let them stew, wallow & get over their own pettiness. Just manning the shower isa a big job, you can't worry about pleasing everyone. There's always going to be a butthole or two in every crowd. <br>  <br>  lol I was hoping this was going to be fun, like gift/shower deco ideas. ;p
F8KmTbqjaa	I find all of my daughters at Kohl's they have up to 2T.  They will be hard to find right now because they are out of season since we are in the middle of winter.  You can get long sleeve and long pants PJ's and put a onsie underneath with long socks tucked underneath the pants!  Its like a home made footie!  : )  My daughter is super long too!  She grew out of her 2T ones this winter so we have to improvise!|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I love the snuggleby "convertafoot" pj's, they can be footed or footless which means you get more life out of them because they fit longer. you can get them off their website, or if your handy with a needle and thread you could always just sew baby socks onto the bottom of the footless ones or put socks on baby and pull the socks up over the cuff of the pj's so they don't come off.|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	I'm about to be in the same situation you are.

Our Target does occasionally have them, but I have had difficulty finding the 12-month size as well.  If there's a Carter's store near you, I'd say that's a great place to check out first.  They definitely have 12-month (and 18-month!) footed PJ's and will carry their entire line, unlike retail stores that may have only a portion of their stuff.<br>  <br>  Downside is that it's the latter half of winter, so people may have bought them out.  I also got an 18-mo footed PJ at Gap before.|`|jhBRNvIxaa	I have had luck at walmart.com and thechildrensplace.com! at the childrens place they have some footed pajamas on sale but at the one by my house we buy the out of season ones for 3 bucks a piece!

Not even born yet and being pushy with her room.<br>  <br>  I used to be able to and not feel much but now if I do I get a tad sting in my belly and it's hard to breathe. So, I dont even try anymore. It just feels better to let my belly go and stretch out.|`|wKuQC4yTaa	I feel like there is a ball in my stomach stopping me from sucking all the way in. i was told to help back pain to stand up strait and suck in, which helped. but this is my first child and when i sucked in and let out, my little girls body had molded a lump of her butt in my stomach. it was the weirdest yet neatest thing i have to say Ive seen yet.|`|07b451c57b519f0c6b496320de3d2deeaa	Nothing lol, im only 8 weeks, but I have gained alot of weight from quiting smoking.

HBgnkltfaa	I really like your taste.<br>  <br>  Adelle Marie is beautiful, and it does flow well.  Very French!  Even though Adelle has fallen in popularity, it doesn't feel dated to me.<br>  <br>  My favorite of your boys' names is Theodore Laurence.  That was the full name of Laurie in "Little Women."  It's a magnificent choice -- even though Theodore has fallen in popularity, it seems to be well-liked on baby name message boards, and thus may be due for a comeback.  It currently ranks #301 in the U.S.<br>  <br>  Like Theodore, Walter and Laurence are both at their least popular right now, but they tend to get a positive response from people, perhaps because they're so refreshingly unexpected.  Walter is currently ranked #378 and Lawrence #392.<br>  <br>  Charles, though old-fashioned, is actually still fairly widely used (ranked #62).  It's a good choice that's still heard, but not too often.<br>  <br>  I don't think you could go wrong with any of these, but the literary Theodore Laurence is my favorite.|`|igvUbqkyaa	I don't like Adelle Marie at all, sorry. But I love Charles Stephen and I adore the nickname Charlie!! I also love the name Edward and that would be my pick if it were an option for a first name.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	I like Charles just fine!  Solid, regal, could be a politician...or a king!|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Charles all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IGfnrfGPaa	Charles Stephen Everod is lovely.

Congrats and Good Luck!!!|`|Kbz8XEf9aa	very old fashioned names...I guess there making a comeback. From your choices I would choose Laurence Edward Everod. I love your girly name!|`|PoBIyZ27aa	Charles Stephen Everod sounds so sophisticated. It's a great name and the nickname "Char" would be really cute!|`|3nL4BgCjaa	Edward Charles Everod would be a sweet name to have. <br>  <br>  Edward Everod just sounds like a Hero name! Never call him Eddie or Ed though...always Edward. Much more respectable name.|`|P9LitgdUaa	Charles Stephen Everod. It sounds dignified, strong, and a bit rrrrrroyal.|`|sh5W8poAaa	I like Laurence Edward, it is unusual yet familiar.|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	Theodore Laurence Everod|`|gBc1Z6gBaa	Definately Charles cos charlie is really cute and it isnt too "upbeat" as u call it|`|LLjD8ElZaa	I like Laurence Edward, but I think laurence is spelled in a feminine way.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	i like Adelle, but I feel almost like it should go with a three syllable name. Adelle Christina Everod is slightly easier on the tongue. Adelle Samantha Everod and Adelle Natasha Everod, even if you don't like those middle names, flow a little more fluently. Adelle Maria would be pretty. :)<br>  <br>  Of your boys' names, I kind of like Walter Everod. It sounds like your little boy is destined to be a governor or something. I'm skeptical to say that I like Laurence, because people may end up calling him Larry. Charlie is cute, but not one of my absolute favorites.<br>  <br>  Walter is cool and collected. And he'll definitely be the only Walter in a sea full of Aidans and Lacobs and Calebs! Good luck!<br>  <br>  *EDIT ~ I read over the Theodore part. I think Theodore Laurence is adorable! Teddy and Theo make great nicknames. I like this better than Walter.|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Charles because you can call him Charlie
K1kZlWY8aa	That's fair, you should have a minimum of 8 hours sleep, and 9-10 is the best. You get 9-9.5, which is very good.<br>  When I was 13 my bedtime was around 9-9:30, and I didn't stop having one until I was close to 16 (keep in mind I moved out when I was 16).<br>  So I think that bedtime is fair =).|`|DQNegurEaa	im 13 and my mom doesnt really care what time i go to bed i think that a 13 year old should make up there mind when its right to go to bed|`|NjXdkwUiaa	For a 13 year that's perfectly fair.|`|s1BaLV1Laa	I think its more than fair.|`|Yr8mWzS8aa	No, I think it's totally fair.

My parents made me go to bed at 9 when I was your age...and yelled at me if I went to go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  My parents still want me to go to bed earlier but they aren't to pressing about it.|`|J3H3C5ksaa	I don't have a set time my parents enforce me to sleep at.

De o de los excrementos. Se aplica a las palabras indecentes relacionadas con los excrementos. Y luego, en letra menuda aparecen escatología 2 como Conjunto de creencias relativas a la vida de ultratumba o tratado sobre ellas; y escatológico 2 como Relativo a las postrimerías, o sea a la muerte y lo que hay detrás de ella.

Die Babys sind st?ndig in Bewegung, rudern mit den Armen, strampeln, sind besonders reizbar, reagieren auf pl?tzliche Berührungen und Ger?usche schreckhaft und lassen sich kaum beruhigen. Sie wirken unglücklich, leiden unter Schlafproblemen und unter ihrer st?ndigen Anspannung. Oft meiden sie die k?rperliche N?he zu ihren Eltern und schmusen ungern. Kurze intensive Kontaktphasen und waches Schauen zieht vor allem Erwachsene an. Etwas sp?ter neigen sie zum frühen Aufrichten und laufen oft schon vor Beginn des 2. Lebensjahres. Interesse findet alles - aber nur für kurze Zeit.<br>  <br>  Kleinkindalter: innere Rastlosigkeit, motorische Hyperaktivit?t - Zappel-Philipp-Syndrom (nur ca. 70% der betroffenen Kinder), geringe Ausdauer beim Spielen, ausgepr?gte Trotzreaktionen, Teilleistungsschw?chen im Bereich visueller und auditiver Wahrnehmung und visomotorischer Koordination, auffallend früher oder verz?gerter Spracherwerb. Im Kindergarten beteiligen sie sich nur ungern an Gruppenspielen, fühlen sich schnell überfordert und st?ren andere Kinder. Sie dominieren gerne und stehen oft im Mittelpunkt. Meist sind sie sehr ehrgeizig, haben aber auffallend niedrige Frustrationsgrenzen und ziehen sich zurück. Auf Fremdbestimmung lassen sie sich nicht oder nur bei akzeptierten Erwachsenen und guten Freunden ein. <br>  <br>  Grundschulalter: starke Ablenkbarkeit, wenig Ausdauer, Impulsivit?t, geringe Frustrationstoleranz, Ungeschicklichkeit, vieles geht zu Bruch, verst?rkter Rededrang, unruhige Schrift, Lese-Rechtschreibe-Schw?che, Rechenschw?che, Klassenwiederholung, Au?enseiter, Tr?umer, niedriges Selbstbewu?tsein, Streitsüchtigkeit. Beim Spielen sind sie ausgelassen, fast übermütig und k?nnen gef?hrliche Situationen nicht richtig einsch?tzen. Ihnen fehlt der überblick und das Einsch?tzenk?nnen einer Situation. Ordnung halten f?llt unendlich schwer, auch wenn sie sich zeitweise redlich darum bemühen.<br>  <br>  Zusatzsymptome: Lese-, Rechtschreib- und/oder Rechenschw?che, Auff?lligkeiten in der Sprachentwicklung und motorischen Entwicklung<br>  <br>  Adoleszenz: zunehmende Selbstwertzerst?rung, ?ngste, aggressives Verhalten, Mutlosigkeit, Verleugnung von Schwierigkeiten, Leistungsverweigerung, Depressionen, Neigung zu Alkohol, Drogen, No-future-Mentalit?t.<br>  <br>  Daneben finden sich aber auch positive Eigenschaften: Sehr gute und lange Konzentration auf Dinge, die Spa? machen und das Interesse wecken, Ideenreichtum, hohe Intelligenz, künstlerische Kreativit?t, Begeisterungsf?higkeit, Hilfsbereitschaft, Gerechtigkeitssinn. <br>  <br>  Der unaufmerksame, nicht hyperaktive Typ (ADS ohne Hyperaktivit?t), meist M?dchen, f?llt meist erst in der Schule auf, wenn die Anforderungern steigen und es nicht mehr reicht, mit einem Ohr hinzuh?ren. Tr?umen und mangelnde Konzentrationsf?higkeit in der Oberstufe macht es den betroffenen Kinder unm?glich, dem Unterricht noch spielerisch zu folgen. Die Kinder lassen mir der Lernleistung nach, verlieren ihre Lebensfreude, werden ?ngstlich und zum Au?enseiter.<br>  ADS bedeutet Aufmerksamkeits-Defizit-Syndrom; ADHS beinhaltet zus?tzlich hyperkinetische Verhaltensauff?lligkeiten. Das Syndrom geh?rt zu den am h?ufigsten anzutreffenden psychischen St?rungen im Kindesalter. Aus den Kindern werden Erwachsene, bei denen die St?rung in verdeckter Weise weiterbesteht und oft schon Folgest?rungen hervorgerufen hat.<br>  Ausl?ser bzw. Ursache der beschriebenen Symptome (Unkonzentriertheit, mangelnde Ausdauer und Langeweilegefühle) ist bei den betroffenen Menschen eine generelle überaktivit?t der Zellen im Gehirn (elektrisches Potential), verst?rkt durch Reizvielfalt und Reizüberflutung aus der Umwelt. Dies geschieht schon in der Kindheit, in der sich zwei verschiedene Syndrom-Typen erkennen lassen: Die "Hyperaktiven" (ADHS), die "Zappelphilipp"-Verhalten zeigen und die "Tr?umer" (ADS), die zwar unauff?llig wirken, jedoch durch geistige Abwesenheit und Langsamkeit der Reaktionen v.a. im Leistungsbereich beeintr?chtigt sind. <br>  Neben Unaufmerksamkeit, Impulsivit?t und Hyperaktivit?t (beim 2. Typ eher innerlich) leiden beide Typen unter vielf?ltigen ?ngsten, treten gern in jedes "Fettn?pfchen" und sagen oft direkt heraus, was sie meinen, unabh?ngig davon, ob es situationsangemessen ist.<br>  Von ADS betroffene Personen haben/machen nicht nur Schwierigkeiten, sondern sie besitzen eine Menge positiver Eigenschaften.

YFPMcHCbaa	It's probably fine since you're not pregnant right now. Only vaccines with live bacteria (MMR) are considered unsafe during pregnancy.
Y9qhkO1faa	Yes and no! I am due on 5-4-09 with baby #4! It's a girl, Grace Madeline! Since this is our fourth (and last) baby, we technically have everything we need. However, there is plenty we still have to do. Bedrooms have to be rearranged for all of the kids before the little one arrives. I'm enjoying being pregnant, but I can't wait to see the little girl who is going to complete our family. 10 weeks to go and I can't (or can) wait. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.|`|p0prrzf2aa	not physically..I'm only 13 weeks so I'm enjoying each day and week as they come. but i can't wait til the baby gets here though :)|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	lucky you have time i am not really reasy either but i dont care for some reason , this is baby #2  i am 12 weeks and wish it were sooner like 2|`|QYYWBrG7aa	We have everything he needs..But still waiting on baby shower March 21st cause he doesn't really have alot of clothes.but other then that yes were ready believe it or not..>:].Wow hope u get ur babys room ready soon.good luck|`|duinadV4aa	yes i am ready when ever he decide to come i'll be ready for him i have everything ready all the way down to the baby bag i am 35weeks and 4days|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	dont stress, im 40wks 2moro and we still havnt finished the room but i do have a 15month old running around too|`|vlCtpi5Oaa	With my first child, I couldn't wait for him to come.

LiJ5TQJraa	I started buying things around the same time as you, about 14wks. I didn't want to jump the gun and buy things before hand and end up miscarrying. so I would buy little things here & there if they were unique, but nothing girl/boy since I didn't know the sex yet. then, after I knew the sex, I think it was at 18 weeks, I bought things I really liked that I didn't want someone else to buy me & it not really be my style. im glad I did hold off on somethings cause I got a lot of things from family & friends. im having my baby shower next week (ill be 7 months 1 week) so ill probably get the remainder of things I need, then whatever I don't get i'll buy afterwards. I think its good to be 100 percent prepared about 4-6wks before your due date incase your baby comes early...you don't want to be with out a bassinet/crib or car seat!|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	I started buying things for the baby just as soon as I found out the sex of the baby. Ive had 3 babies, and have found out at about 20 weeks with all of them. Once I know what colors to buy, then I start getting ready for baby. Congrats on your first baby!|`|uQc4UA2Caa	i got a couple of white things at 12-16 weeks then when we knew its a girl the shopping began! we moved house as we were living seperate an now her room is nearly complete.<br>  she has a full chest of drawers full of clothes from size 00000 to size 1 !!! im still only 29 weeks :)|`|4jeqIx6Paa	to be honest im 30 weeks now and i still havnt bought anything for the baby because i dont have money right now to shop like that , and i coulnt hold a babyshower ...no friends around... so honestly im just bad with money right now...|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I started buying clothes that were on clearance at about 12 weeks because I knew of a few other people who were pregnant so I knew that at least someone should be having the opposite gender as me and I could give the other stuff to them. I mean I was getting bag full of clothes for very cheap so I couldn't pass it up. I didn't start buying normal priced things (and still things that were on sale too) around 20 weeks when i found out I was having a boy. I bought the crib and bedding shortly after that. Then I waited to get everything else until after I had my baby shower at 31 weeks and good thing I didn't because I got everything else I needed then (besides diapers since no matter how many you get you still need more)|`|gn12STiuaa	There is nothing to be sorry about I am 40 weeks pregnant so I've been there I wouldn't suggest buying anything or setting up the room until after 24 weeks just in case something happens such as a miscaraige it would be really hard to look at that room every day ax what I did was waited until after my baby shower to buy everything that way you don't get duplicates of stuff and you can save your money for the stuff you really need and don't get.|`|pxauSJCxaa	I waited until I found out the sex because for most of the stuff, it depends on the baby's sex. But some things can be boought in advance like cotton diapers, stroller, crib, blankets, washcloth, ect.  I did wait at least after my 15th week because it is said to be bad luck to purchase anything before that.|`|FwN2Htoraa	Congratulation for you first pregnancy. I have a son and daughter. I know their sex in my early pregnancy.  list all the thing need for  the baby. I bought bit and piece  right after that. take a look of the www.moonbaby.com.au you will need a good nursing pillow for you breastfeed. Take care.|`|NSMV0XCEaa	Well most people say not to start buying things until your around 5 or 6 months..but I couldn't help myself, I started around two months.<br>  <br>  <br>  I worked on his room a little by little. as i bought things I just set them up in his room.|`|S3t69kh2aa	Most moms can't wait to do this.

a7pgX1W8aa	Try going to a chiropractor. An adjustment will take pressure off your nerves. It helped me with my pains. You may need to go a lot in the beginning and then the visits will go down. Hope this helps.|`|IdoZbO39aa	How much does it hurt!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have had sciatica on and off during my pregnancy, so painful. I spoke to my nurse and obstetrician and they said to use a heat pack in bed at night (perfectly safe if you don't put it directly on your tummy!). I can say it definitely helped me out but the sciatica is something that has come back on and off. I also ended up getting a sciatic massage when i was about 28 weeks preg, that helped for a couple of days.<br>  All the best with it all - the perks of being pregnant :)|`|jhBRNvIxaa	For the pain it is best to lay down or take a tylenol.

I have found that exercise helps.  It hurts at first, but then as you strengthen those muscles around the nerve, it gets better.  If you can, try swimming..it's really good for relieving sciatic pain and doesn't hurt while doing it.  If you don't have a place to swim.....try talking a 10 min. walk.  It may take a few days, but it seems to be helping mine ease up.  When the pain bothers you....lie on your side opposite of the pain until it subsides.  Also, stretching helps.|`|07b451c57b519f0c6b496320de3d2deeaa	Ahh I just had that the other day!

Liav Wesley, Liav Johnston, something along those lines - very simple and masculine.

I have been having issues with them and never got the line as dark or darker than the control line! If it doesn't work this time then next month I will just do the baby dance every OTHER day once my period stops. The sperm is good for at least 3 days so it doesn't really matter when you ovulate. I have done research, it doesn't really matter what position, which ever is most comfortable. Just let him come deep in you, that is the best way. You don't need to elevate your hips or any of that! By the time all is said and done there is already enough sperm headed up that it is okay! I don't know about what to eat but I heard that if you take mucinex 3 days before you ovulate and 2 days after, that it will thin your cervical mucous and allow the sperm to travel better. Haven't tried it, but it sounds like it could be a good suggestion! Well good luck and tons of baby dust!
5f6XnInEaa	I plan on trying to take his bottles away at 12 months.<br>  <br>  A toddler does not need a bottle, and it makes me cringe to see children old enough to have a conversation with you, and walk, sitting in a stroller , drinking a bottle.<br>  <br>  Plus, it's bad for their teeth after that age anyway.|`|mnQXmZbeaa	I have two much younger siblings and my mom started taking them off the bottle around 18 months. She alternated between the bottle and cup so they could use to it and then it was the cup during the day and the bottle for nap time or "night night". Then she would only give them the cup after about 2 weeks.|`|KihffCc5aa	My first was a bottle addict, it was our fault!  She put her bottles out for Santa to pick up and give to other babies, when she was three.<br>  <br>  With our current baby, he could care less about bottles, he wants his food.

F8KmTbqjaa	I was in labor for 36 hours and the first 16 I could not have an epidural because I was not 5 cms dilated yet.  Around hour 11 I could not take it anymore and I needed to sleep.  They gave me a shot of Demerol through my IV and I was out for 3 hours!  It worked really well and gave me just enough pain relief to rest for a little.  The epidural is not that bad.  If you end up having to get a c-section you have to get an epidural or spinal so you got to get over your fear lady.  Good Luck.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I forgot, the nurse will MAKE you hold still if you don't.  I was freaking out so bad when they put the needle in and she held my head in between her legs and pushed my arms straight so I could not move!  LOL|`|5f6XnInEaa	I think I already told you mine..in the same question you asked earlier...<br>  <br>  I had a shot of Pethidine.<br>  And it was awful.<br>  <br>  It made me loopy, sick and tired.<br>  <br>  They still offer Gas and Air at most places.|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I'm wondering the same thing, because my hospital does not offer epidurals, they are only given for for c-sections...something to do with no anesthesiologist on staff all the time or something like that, I think its stupid.

AA11256693	You need to drink a lot more water. The headache and dizziness can both be due to dehydration.<br>  Eat bland foods and lots of applesauce to help with the nausea.

PwrF9OtWaa	they can help replenish deficiencies that may be causing conception problems...<br>  <br>  as far as actually making you MORE fertile i'm not sure, but they are definitely a great thing to take while you are trying to conceive. <br>  <br>  if you don't take them while trying to become pregnant, it won't harm you or your baby, but if you get pregnant with some sort of vitamin deficiency it will most likely progress with the pregnancy and then it can be harmful.<br>  <br>  it's best to take them. it definitely won't hurt!|`|hmOidFp3aa	No, it is not harmful!

I am pretty sure they do not increase your chances of fertility. I do know of this stuff called fertility though! It is supposed to increase your chances and it proven to do so! Tell your friend to go to this website<br>  <a href="http://www.fertilaid.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fertilaid.com/</a><br>  It sells the vitamins and has great advice!

There is also a vitamin called Fertilaid that is supposed to help you conceive and be a prenatal vitamin. There are lots of women that dont take prenatal vitamins before they are pregnant bc they weren't trying in the first place. It won't harm you if you don't take them but it cuts down on the chances that your baby will have birth defects if you do. If you are trying to conceive you should be taking them.|`|Efa5EYJJaa	For those who are ttc it is a good idea to take a prenatal vitamin. The extra vitamins won't hurt you, the body just passes it through. I have been taking prenatals for 5 years. I just had my first child December 13, and I am still taking them. I don't know if they can make you more fertile or not, but I do have pcos and had a baby without medication.|`|fG727pkuaa	Prenatal vitamins help prepare your body for a baby.

a7pgX1W8aa	Give him a nice warm bath and use Johnson Nighttime lotion before bed at least every other day. On the days you don't wash him use some Johnson nigh time massage gel, this will help calm him down and relax him. When you know his teeth are really bother him, give him some tylenol or ibuprofen before bed with a little night time ambesol on the areas you can tell are probably hurting. Give him one of his favorite stuffed toys or blanket, this will help him feel better and secure. Finally buy yourself a Homedics Sound Spa lullaby relaxation machine for his room turn that on. It has a timer on it that goes up to 1 hour. The machine can cost up to $ 30 dollars, but is totally worth it. I did all this for my son and it helps him. I finally got some sleep. Maybe it will help yours. Good Luck. Hope this helps.|`|JJZi7r6maa	Try putting an oatmeal baby cereal in the bottle before he goes to sleep.

So - congratulations!<br>  <br>  It also sounds like you're very early on so it's too early too see via ultrasound. It takes a very, very skilled tech AND radiologist to find the baby early on. That's why the beta testing is important, and it sounds like your numbers are rising great - a terrific sign that your pregnancy is on track.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps hon! Let us know how you do, okay?|`|BO28Mn8haa	:) good luck!!|`|rM8WrUFNaa	Well usually they wont even do an ultrasound if your HCG level (PG horomone) doesnt indicate that your far enough along to see something. Which in your case could be the same as mine was. It was to early to see the embryos but I was under 5 wks pregnant with twins. Which was why they couldnt see anything and my HCGs were so high. So that could be why you have high and rising HCGS but no visible embryo. Good luck, I hope everything goes great for you.|`|ygcbrp5Uaa	It sounds like it could very well be a miscarriage. Just to be sure though, go out to the store ASAP and get a pregnancy test. Take it. If it registers that you're pregnant despite and empty ultra sound, GO TO THE HOSPITAL! It could be that you are pregnant, but are having an ectopic pregnancy or are caring a fetus in your fallopian tube. It would explain the bleeding with no cramping if the tube ruptured...<br>  <br>  If not though, then the hormone level could just be from the stress and anticipation from not knowing, and the bleeding should stop on its own.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to worry or scare you, but please just do it to be safe.|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Ugh that first confirmation seems like it takes forever! Hang in there! HCG levels do not rise for no reason so that alone confirms that you are pregnant. Hopefully it is a healthy and successful one! Good luck!
YFPMcHCbaa	Don't be worried. If you're at least 37 weeks, you're considered full term.
lkGmAJZGaa	Are you talking like after you get off Birth Control?? Cause you can get busy right away on the subject.. or if your talking like after you are married or with someone that is your decision.. Who cares what society says. Do what is right for you and what is going to make you happy!|`|PwHQSAxvaa	If it is something you want to do, why wait? Nature does not give you forever.|`|JtUuMdRKaa	after u have sex without protection...nine months, more or less
YwHl37Hgaa	Take a teaspoon each of fresh mint juice, lemon juice, and a tablespoon of honey thrice daily. Half a teaspoon of cumin seed powder mixed with a teaspoon of honey before food helps to fight nausea.

32fa7268fd210c30ef24617cf0e76c6baa	Charlotte Rose Rogers is a pretty Name.It sounds very nice together..|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I think it's very pretty!!<br>  :)|`|igvUbqkyaa	WOW I actually have that exact name on my list of favorites - Charlotte Rose is absolutely GORGEOUS. I just adore both names and they sound beautiful together. And Charlotte Rose Rogers sounds great plus it is not like everyone is going to call her by her full name, just Charlotte Rogers which sounds terrific! Beautiful Choice! Good Luck!|`|35JIECGRaa	Charlotte Rogers seems to flow nicely, but Charlotte Rose Rogers doesn't ... perhaps slightly changing it to Charlotte Rosalie Rogers or Charlotte Rosalyn Rogers will be better, because they make the name flow better!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and congratulations on your pregnancy! Let me know what you decide! :)|`|S9jyc95jaa	I like it.  Rose is a bit of a common middle name (if you aren't picking it in tribute of a family member or something), but I really like the name Charlotte. :)|`|tCBcAhUGaa	i love it it elegant and flirty and spunky all at the same time. its a name that really could fit anyone not ust a certain persona my only omplaint is the double r is a bit i dont now 1920/1930|`|HrRkeiqKaa	I like it... Charlotte Rose sounds like an adorable girl who has shyness to her, it is a keeper to me! I wanted to name my daughter Layla Rose but my hubby did not agree so we settled with Faith Layla instead. Go with what ur heart tells u after all u r the one who would be calling her name out in many different tones for the rest of ur life :0) Good luck and Congrats on the baby!|`|POGZZmoUaa	I like Charlotte Rogers and I like Rose Rogers, but Charlotte Rose Rogers just isn't quite right, a little bit of a tongue twister.  I'd choose Charlotte and find another middle name. The middle name needs to be two syllables.|`|fPuZGkmsaa	I think that it flows together very nicely. Both names are older and Charlotte has some cute nicknames. I think that it will be cute when she is younger and sophisticated when she is older. It is unique, easy to spell and pronounce. I say go for it!!|`|tHEBPDenaa	Rose Rogers doesn't flow the best together but I would still use it. How often do people say their full name? Very rarely. It's a nice name. I would use it.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	i like it. it's unique and memorable without being completely weird, haha|`|9lyzXd1Yaa	Sounds like a hooker's name<br>  <br>  PS no kidding|`|7adzqyGgaa	dont relly like it
wEEOvu5Waa	I never really thought about using house hold items to tell if you're pregnant or not. I suppose someone could just wait until they got pretttyyy big and missed quite a bit of periods, that would be one heck of a sign lol. Probably not the best though.<br>  <br>  I know I heard something from this old lady by where I live, something about eating an apple and if it seems to be rotting after an hour, than you are not pregnant. If it doesn't rot then its a sign of a miracle in your body..or something.<br>  <br>  But this lady also likes to walk around outside in the nude, so, I cant say I believe her. x_x|`|rPhP6ILgaa	I know of an old wife tail where u pee on some flower and it it bubble ur pregnant...Im sorrry but I dnt rem the name of the flower.|`|qUnPpZNJaa	actually i dont think there are and even there is i dont think they would be 100% affective just buy one from the pharmacy!
s1BaLV1Laa	It could be but it could not be. I know it is hard to wait. But that is really the only option. And with most pregnancy tests 4 days before is to early to get an accurate test. Best is to wait till after she miss a period and do a 1st morning test.<br>  <br>  You can get a blood test dome witch can tell you much earlier, it can pick up pregnancy 7 to 12 days after conceiving.|`|rPhP6ILgaa	Idk about bleeding, but I know spotting is a sign of implantation bleeding which occusr in early pregnancy. Tell her to take a first response tst they are very sensitive and detect pregnancy hormone very early on!!!|`|WNn8WDPHaa	yes it is.. but it depends on ow much blood. if a lot with clotting or tissue in it than possiblemiss carriagee, but generally in the first trimester, in the early part. the egg will plant itself one side of the uterus. she needs to see a doctor anyways
SlBsJ3NRaa	Sever ties with your guy friend. Youcan chat on the phone, email, text, watever, but don't go to his house and don't let him come to yours. What you are doing now is called an "emotional affair" meaning no sex, but you are treading thin ice. Sharing intimate thoughts and feelings can lead to being intimate. If you screw up once, you can ruin everything. <br>  <br>  It's okay to wonder what if, but you sound dangerously close to acting on your curiousity. Don't risk your family for something you know would be a mistake.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	If you guys were meant to be together, you would be together.But you're not.<br>  <br>  You have something everyone women would kill for...a great husband.Don't take it for granted! Your husband IS your best friend.Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Obviously you have feelings for this guy and it is not right to keep communicating with him.You are just taunting yourself and its not fair to you.<br>  <br>  You can be here for him now during this time, but once his dad gets better, cut off all ties and just lay it down straight that you cannot see someone who you have feelings for when you have a husband at home.<br>  <br>  Don't feel guilty though.This happens to a lot of people.Just don't let lust get the best of you because you will regret it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope all goes well.|`|X39HuK6Vaa	i know that you are utterly concerned about your friend. but you do need to know the limitations of your friendship. let's put it with one simple question, whom do you really love?. As i've observed, you love your Husband because you feel very guilty about what you feel towards your friend. Just think of your children, you don't want them to suffer, right?.|`|sGUPNkQdaa	seven year itch..  READ your own Question, it describe what you would consider and have: a perfect man/husband/care take/friend/confidant and more... why ruin what you ALREADY  have and most of us seek for.. don't search or seek approval listen to your own intuitions. be his friend and support him through a phone, the less contact is the less mistakes.<br>  '' QUOTE " these are your own words honey; " and I would die if I ever lost him "<br>  <br>  Make the right choice. Good Luck
Efa5EYJJaa	There is a medication called Reglin. I tried it and it didn't help me. I am now taking an herbal called Fenugreek. It has helped some but I still am not producing enough, but I am producing more. It is all natural but it is not regulated by the FDA. My son eats a little less formula after I nurse him and I pump and get a little more and mix my breastmilk with his formula. If you use the herbal it will make your urine smell like maple syrup just so you know and are not alarmed. I guess there is a sickness that does that so if you go to the doctor for a checkup make sure you tell them you are taking it. Good luck I know how frustrating that can be.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Have you contacted your local La Leche League?  They should be able to send someone to help evaluate what the baby is doing and make suggestions.  Or contact the hospital where you gave birth and talk with the lactation consultant.  You may very well have a good supply but he can't access it and you/your body doesn't have the hang of pump.  You can get thru this though!<br>  <br>  My son was a preemie and I had to rely soley on pumping for the first 12-13 weeks until he learned to breastfeed.  While your baby is learning to breastfeed here are some things that might help:<br>  -use a good pump: rent a hospital grade pump or a Medela Pump In Style<br>  -learn how to pump effectively-I had to learn to relax while pumping, had a pic of my little on to look at, and as silly as it sounds I used to visualize flood gates opening and milk rushing out to help my let down<br>  -I usually pumped for at least 20 minutes at every session.  I found I always got another let down bet. 15-20 minute mark<br>  -When you feed your baby the bottle take off your shirt, hold him close and in a position if you were breastfeeding him, burp him, and move him over to the other side just like you would if he were breastfeeding.  I had to do this routine with my little on for 6 weeks before he got it.<br>  -Try using Playtex nursers with the latex nipple.  I had to get my son from the hospital bottles to the Playtex and then to the breast.  It took 6-7 weeks of work but we got it and he breastfed till he was 16 months old.<br>  -Keep eating well, drink lots of water, and rest.  Those all help with supply<br>  <br>  I know there are supplements but I've never used them and I know other fabulous breastfeeding moms on here know them and will guide you with that part.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5ZvALiclaa	yes there are medications that increase supply pretty much overnight so make an appointment to see your doctor. However, pumping never produces as much milk as actual breastfeeding sucking so can you ditch the bottles and put him to the breast?<br>  <br>  I've never had luck pumping much but actually breastfeeding isn't a drama. Try breastfeeding him yourself and use the medications|`|Ddb5821Jaa	I agree with Zoe, the more your baby is at your breast, your body will be stimulated to produce milk, AND the more you offer the breast, the more your baby will be Accustomed to it.<br>  <br>  I would cut the coffee(caffeine) out completely, I have read it stops production of milk. <br>  <br>  Also, are you emptying each breast every 2 hours... completely ...via breastfeeding or pumping? That may be the trick to stimulating more milk production.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Ask your doctor about fenugreek.  It is an herb that is supposed to increase milk production.  <br>  <br>  Also, before every pumping session, put your baby to your breast and try to get him to latch.  Even if he is still unable to, just having him near your breast will help stimulate production.  I had the same trouble as you.  But I kept trying all the time and my baby finally latched on at 3 weeks old.  Unfortunately I could never catch my supply up to her demand since I had to supplement the whole time I was pumping and at 3 months she started to reject the breast completely.  But at least she got a good start of breastmilk.|`|RgYuXggfaa	There are herbal supplements that you are suppose to be able to take.  Give your doctor a call and see what they recommend for that to make sure that it wont hurt the baby.|`|O7U1tUaJaa	there is nothing that I'm aware of the only thing I can suggest is supplementing formula.  I had the same issue with my son.  when he can home from the hospital he wanted to take 4oz. bottles and my body would not make a 4 oz. bottle every 2-3 hours.  at 2.5 months I had to switch him over to formula completely because he was taking 8 oz.  we had to start him on cereal at 10 weeks.  he's now 14 weeks and on cereal in the morning, bottles until dinner then baby food and he will take anywhere from 8-14 oz before bed (14 oz only happened once)  his height and weight are proportionate but he is off of the growth chart.  some babies just need more than we can give them.
11N5NSAqaa	i don't want to scare you but that happened to me once with my boyfriend, AND i was taking the pill, and i got pregnant.  with that said, my situation was like a 1 in million, and the chances of her getting pregnant are not that high but i just wanted to let you know that anything is possible.  if this incident happened within the past 72 hours, tell her to go to your local pharmacy and ask for the Plan B pill.  if it was over 72 hours, she just has to wait.  masturbating and urinating have nothing to do with the chances of her getting pregnant...all it takes is one "strong swimmer" and you've got a conception.  if she is able to take the Plan-B pill (and it is not an "abortion pill"  thats what some people call it) and doesn't get her period on time--don't be alarmed, especially since it is so close to the time she is supposed to get it....however if it does not come within a week I would suggest buying a pregnancy test.  <br>  i hope everything works out for the both of you.  in my situation i decided to terminate the pregnancy because i was so young (only 18)..it's not 5 years later and i am doing just fine and i know it was the right decision.    <br>    either way...good luck!|`|alJA3jyCaa	It's between 15-20% in each cycle for doing that way. If you don't pull out it's 20-25% each cycle. So it's a real gamble, use condoms.|`|CzBNTeLAaa	50 % chance|`|N4nYw5B8aa	The fact that you masturbated earlier that day means that your sperm count will be lower than usual. There is still a very real chance she could become pregnant. The pull-out method is way too risky to consider a form of birth control. Be smarter in the future!|`|iwEpYKlMaa	About 2percent.|`|WT5tYLdfaa	more than likely you didnt get her pregnant|`|vPg0TmM2aa	there is always a chance. that is why you should always wear a condom!! get her a preg test just to be on safe side
PrxlHUT5aa	well yes they are psychologically egocentric at this age... and while my daughter didn't yell at her father for kissing me, she'd always get in between us requesting for a "group hug!" she'd say... altogether stopping our exclusive one-on-one husband&wife time.  your son is just competing for affection, he's worried he's losing on something if he didn't get as much kisses and cuddle time.  just assure him that you love him as much as you love daddy and daddy loves him back and suggest that you group hug with daddy instead of shooing him away :o) or it could be an Oedipus complex.|`|abLF20Nuaa	This is absolutely normal. All babies need attention, although some more than others. This need for attention is gained natural through breast feeding, parental feeding, and rocking him to sleep. This is only a phas and I can personally cay this because he WILL come to hate you in 10 years or sore, probably less. For now, just let him have the attention that he needs so dearly and enjoy the feeling that will leave in a matter of time.|`|PqPc10Fgaa	Yes he is Jealous! .....It will all break out soon. But why dont you try this. If he is around looking at you guys. Why dont you pick him up, have daddy kiss him and then you kiss him. Then tell him......to go wait in his room or just send him off some where. So you and your husband can have a time to make a quick kiss. Or when he is not looking, get a kiss fast lol.|`|3X8Igzhxaa	yes we are all born with emotions if they cry cause there hungry then why cant they get jealous|`|eeaXYyCNaa	Little boys are especially jealous of their mommy's.  Totally normal.  He will get over it with time.
e1d737ecf0f11ed65f51b189ae2f0b03aa	consider cutting out dairy for awhile.  many in our family have a dairy sensitivity but it doesn't seem a problem in the daytime for me, more if I drink milk before bed.<br>  <br>  9 is old enough for your daughter to start figuring out her own body and become proactive about her own healing.  Ask her what her gut instinct tells her is the problem.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	is she locking the door of the bathroom when sick , it maybe self induced, i hope i am wrong|`|rNvXWMOMaa	we're not doctors, get off your butt and take her to a doctor.|`|cO6BD3hVaa	Try putting her on a very bland diet of banana's, toast, tea, apple sauce, ectect.  No dairy items or spicy foods (as you stated) for a couple days to a week.  If this doesn't help take her to an ER doctor.  If this persists it could severely effect the esophagus.<br>  Good Luck!<br>  Hope she gets to feeling better!|`|bc27bca0091c66c66f4aa1e409b7ff4daa	that sounds scary. not to freak you out but i recently seen a show on TLC about a little boy that threw up constantly after a meal. no matter where they took the child no one figured it out. finally they found out that somehow his stomach moved up into his chest and therefore was why he was throwing up so much. maybe take your daughter to an allergist.. could be allergic to some type of food. also maybe get xrays? just in case if her stomach was moved.. its very rare. i hope all ends well.|`|oem5yEUDaa	Is she scared of the dark? Does she have nightmares? Maybe she has anxiety about bed time.|`|0ZyHN4Taaa	Fear of something, or trauma.|`|ilzSv9Ltaa	I went through the same thing when I was little and my brother did too. It is nightmares. I got really bad nightmares around that age and I got so scared that I made myself sick and I threw up. Same thing happened to my brother.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	it all depends on what she is eating...try a more natural diet without processed foods and try laying off of mucous hormone filled cows milk and all wheat containing products for a while and see if she improves...she might have celiac disease or milk intolerance|`|qQJdi0p1aa	talk to her.. maybe she is nervous about something?maybe its dairy products<br>  <br>  for my son it was an inner ear problem that effected his balance so when he would lie down the room would "spin" and he would get sick|`|1enIWBGnaa	Sounds like she's learning some bad habits from her friends at school.<br>  YOU need to sit down and discuss this with her - NOW!|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	I would find a doctor that would take your concerns seriously.|`|iQ13PoEiaa	maybe she has some sort of eating disorder.|`|TOIB45Fgaa	why don't you ask a doctor?|`|RJNuazqbaa	I saw a show on TLC a while back about a young girl (I think she was in kindergarten?) who would randomly vomit in the night only. She was not eating anything that would upset her stomach just like your daughter. Her doctors also weren't concerned. It turns out, however, that she was having seizures in the middle of the night that were causing her to vomit. They figured it out by a brain scan they did when she stayed overnight I think, I can't remember for sure I saw the show a while ago. The show was called Medical Mysteries or something like that on TLC. So your daughter could have a neurological problem (seizures) instead of a gastrointestinal problem.|`|GcSEIIzFaa	If your doctor isn't concerned, I'd call a different doctor....<br>  <br>  A good doctor, even if he isn't "concerned" will at least explain what might be causing it so that it eases your mind.<br>  <br>  In any case, it doesn't sound normal or healthy... I'd call a different doctor for sure. Tell him frequency/eating habits/etc. If it's distressing to you or it causes you to worry, then it's a problem; you shouldn't have to worry and stress about it without any knowledge of what's happening.|`|63d5f55f9f8a5688ac3ba02cea929784aa	I seen this documentary on TV about a little girl who kept throwing up every night. This was on Discovery Health channel. The mother would ask the girl if she remembers throwing up at night and she said no she doesn't remember anything. They finally took her to a neurologist and did a sleep study they found out that she has epilepsy and her throwing up at night was her seizures. So try taking her to a  pediatrician or neurologist. Family doctors won't tell you anything because they won't run any tests.|`|j6iO0CqTaa	prehaps the flu? Or maybe she's been getting dizzy or doing something before bed you are unaware of? spinning? sorry.. thats all I got.
Og09Q7ylaa	Not likely. You can only get pregnant at or around the time of ovulation. If you were on day 1 or 2 of your cycle, the chances of ovulation quickly enough to allow fertilization are astronomically small. Even so... chicky, we have so many birth control options. Use them.|`|7jdvcrTKaa	Sounds normal to me.  When I was on BC, after 3 days of my period, I would have sex with my boyfriend in order to make it shorter.  Don't do that now though since I am not on BC.  Since you are not, from what I am understanding by the question, I wouldn't say that that means you are pregnant, but in order to prevent that from happening, whether you are on your cycle or not, I would suggest taking time out from the lovemaking and make sure that he straps it up next time.
NMzlbWt8aa	don't listen to the people saying that you are crushing your baby... its not gonna be born with deformities just because you slept on your tummy.  You can do this right now, tho its not recommended.  When your sleeping you cant help what position you end up in.  Tho the farther along you are you will be less and less moving onto your tummy because it will soon be impossible.  If you do find you need to lie on the tummy, prop some pillows under your hips and breast to kind of support you so you aren't laying directly on it.|`|7da94e3c936a7afc3d03e6dc12b85b9daa	Don't worry you will soon have no choice but, to give up the stomach sleeping. Then you will enter the realm of "my back hurts like hell". I recommend investing in a snoogle. (you can get them at babies r us).|`|wKuQC4yTaa	yes, your pushing your uterus inward. right now there is plenty of room to do that, but in a couple months you wont be able to sleep on your stomach.|`|38d028bc56d9bc387cc68a62a4dc8311aa	i slept on my stomach until i was about 7-months then i just could breath anymore.....it is fine....if you're comfortable dont worry when you get uncomfortable you will DEFINELTY be sleeping on your side|`|aBgxHAjfaa	You will not crush your baby, I was foolish enough to believe that also but my doctor said that your baby is surrounded by amniotic fluid and your uterus is a very soft place to be, youre not harming it. If anything, it will eventually get more uncomfortable for you as your pregnancy progresses.|`|QIUCmRFoaa	Your body will tell you when it is uncomfortable with the way you are positioned.  Baby doesn't feel a thing, its all about how YOU feel.  You can't smoosh your baby by sleeping on your stomach.  When you start having a hard time, you will automatically switch to your side...  Good luck and be comfortable!|`|WDfktpvwaa	MY GOD your not crushing your baby! Believe it or not that baby is SUPER protected inside your uterus! My friend slept on her stomach all nine months, I don't know how because its super uncomfortable after about 5 months bust she did. I am a stomach sleeper and I had to switch to my side at around 4 months because I was super uncomfortable. Suggestion, just ask your doc about it.|`|N4nYw5B8aa	When you sleep on your stomach when you're pregnant you are blocking the blood vessels that lead to your uterus and could potentially harm your baby. It is recommended to sleep on your RIGHT side when pregnant to allow the best blood flow to the placenta and uterus.|`|Fpt3n7Tdaa	still be ok for now. but after that like a weeks or fill weeks you can't do it you have to lay on you side.is good for you baby in you stomach . baby need some room for grow up. some time baby  awake and eat when you sleeping and sleeping when you awake.|`|KihffCc5aa	You and your body will learn to adjust, soon you won't be able to comfortable sleep on your stomach.  You'll have to adjust to side sleeping, I highly suggest a long pillow to comfort onto so it makes you think you are sleeping on your stomach.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the wonderful world of pregnant belly sleepers!  :)<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|Jcz29H2Oaa	all thoes people who said something will be wrong with your baby, you are crushing your baby, or your baby will have deformitys... are IDIOTS. there is nothing wrong with sleeping on your stomache. pretty soon you will be so big you wont be able to lol, it will feel like your laying on a basketball. trust me, youll know when you shouldnt sleep on your tummy anymore... it wont feel right anymore. im in my 4th month too and i have a definate preggo belly and i fall asleep on my side and ALWAYS wakeup on my belly... and my baby is FINE. lol some people are so dumb hahaha they talk like they know whats up.
NMzlbWt8aa	no reason to feel like a fool.  Wait another two weeks or so before you test again... and keep having sex, it doesn't hurt to keep trying.  Also ask your DR to do a blood pregnancy test.  Those can detect early pregnancy better than the HPT sometimes.  Good luck hun and lots of baby dust.|`|xubIaiZaaa	quite possibly you are could be pregnant but not far along enough to get a reading on a test. Go to the doctor and get a blood test to be sure. Good luck!!!|`|07i0Xyevaa	Make an appt with ur doctor and ask for an quantitive hcg test by that time ull know for  sure if ur <br>  <br>  quantitive = test ur blood for pregnancy hormone must be above .5<br>  <br>  good luck|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	could ur date be wrong??? test again or see a doctor|`|OWReYgV5aa	I think it's still possible.  What type of test did you take?  Some register a higher level of HCG than others...try finding a sensitve test...look on www.peeonastick.com for the most sensitive brands.  Good luck!!
11N5NSAqaa	first off, your doctor sounds like an ***...that said, a delayed period could be caused by a lot of things.  were you sexually active in the past six months?  if so, obviously you could possibly be pregnant.  other things that affect a women's menstrual cycle are her diet (have you changed your diet at all? or are you not eating correctly?), elevated/high levels of stress, and excessive exercising.  thing about these things and see if they apply to you at all.<br>     a few ways to tell you may be pregnant...have you felt nauseas in the mornings?  increased thirst?  increased urination?  fatigue and feeling more tired than usual?  sleeping more than usual?  tenderness in your breasts?  increased sensitivity toward different things, like food?   if you answered yes to any of these you may want to stop by your local drug store and pick up a test. <br>     however, the chances of you being 5 months pregnant and not knowing it for sure are very slim.  you would definitely have been able to see changes and growth by now.   <br>     hope i could help you out a little...best of luck!!|`|46cd2ca02c07674e58e26d9c11367762aa	If the doctor took your blood during some part of the appointment.

HqOkC2YHaa	I personally found the liquid a lot easier! I wish the liquid formula I use was cheaper...I have switched to powder because there's a 20$ difference.<br>  <br>  The best way I found to make it was to take a juice container and mix 1 can to 1 can of water...if you want to make it by the bottle it's always equal parts formula to equal parts liquid (ie: if you're making a 6 oz bottle it would be 3oz of liquid and 3oz of water)<br>  <br>  But do beware, some babies do react to the liquid because the preservatives in the can they might have problems pooping or more gassy. But you'll never know until you try it out!<br>  <br>  Good luck with it!|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you have to add water to it right? or is it ready to feed?

a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	Responda antes, a si mesma algumas quest?es:<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  1- Houve contato do espermatozóide com a vagina?<br>  <br>  N?o precisa nem ter havido penetra??o basta o contato do sêmen com a vagina para aumentar o risco de gravidez<br>  <br>  Mesmo que ele tenha ejaculado fora, no líquido lubrificante que sai do pênis já contém espermatozóides.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  2- Você transou em seu período fértil?<br>  <br>  A ovula??o varia de acordo com os dias de dura??o do ciclo menstrual de cada mulher. Ela ocorre mais ou menos dez dias após a menstrua??o ter acabado. E é durante este período que a mulher está fértil que aumenta a possibilidade de ficar grávida. <br>  <br>  Durante a ovula??o, ocorrem intensas modifica??es em todo o organismo, que, às vezes, podem ser sentidas. Sensa??es de incha?o, náuseas, v?mitos, secre??o vaginal parecida com "clara de ovo", s?o algumas delas. No período da ovula??o, as chances da mulher engravidar aumentam 30%.<br>  <br>  Para calcular seu período fértil conte 14 dias da data do início de seu último ciclo menstrual, e a partir daí conclua que você estará ovulando entre dois dias antes e dois dias depois desta data.<br>  <br>  ATEN??O: Essas datas s?o baseadas em um ciclo regular de 28 dias. <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  3- Você sentiu sintomas de gravidez?<br>  <br>  Atraso da menstrua??o:<br>  Quando aparece: é o primeiro sintoma de uma possível gravidez <br>  Outras causas possíveis: Ganho ou perda de peso excessivo, fadiga, problemas hormonais, stress, tens?o.<br>  <br>  Náuseas e V?mitos:<br>  Quando aparece: 2 a 8 semanas após a fecunda??o<br>  Outras causas possíveis: intoxica??o alimentar, tens?o, infec??o, doen?a da vesícula biliar e outras doen?as.<br>  <br>  Seios doloridos e inchados:<br>  Quando aparece: 1 a 2 semanas após a fecunda??o<br>  Outras possíveis causas: Desordem hormonal, pílulas anticoncepcionais,proximidade da menstrua??o.<br>  <br>  Cansa?o e sonolência:<br>  Quando aparece: 1 a 6 semanas após a fecunda??o<br>  Outras possíveis causas: Stress, fadiga, depress?o e sobrecarregamento físico ou mental. Poderia também ser um resfriado ou gripe.<br>  <br>  Escurecimento dos mamilos:<br>  Quando aparece: é também um dos primeiros sinais e surge entre a 1a e a 14a semana de gesta??o e dura até o final da gravidez<br>  Outras possíveis causas: Desordem hormonal<br>  <br>  Movimento Fetal:<br>  Quando aparece: Entre a 16a e a 22a semana após a fecunda??o<br>  Outras possíveis causas: Gases e movimentos gastrointestinais<br>  <br>  Vontade freqüente de urinar:<br>  Quando aparece: Entre a 6a e a 8a semana após a fecunda??o<br>  Outras possíveis causas: Diabetes, infec??o urinária, excesso de alimentos diuréticos como, muita fruta<br>  <br>  Pequeno sangramento:<br>  Quando aparece: Pequenas gotas de sangue de cor rosa ou marrom, às vezes acompanhadas por cólicas estomacais. Causado pela implanta??o do óvulo no revestimento endometrial. Geralmente ocorre cerca de uma semana depois da ovula??o.<br>  Outras possíveis causas: início da menstrua??o, sangramento comum entre os ciclos de ingest?o de pílulas anticoncepcionais.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  5- Você fez algum teste?<br>  <br>  Todos os testes de gravidez procuram na urina ou no sangue por um horm?nio especial que só aparece quando a mulher está grávida. Esse horm?nio, gonadotrofina cori?nica humana (hCG), também é conhecido como horm?nio da gravidez. <br>  <br>  Testes de farmácia: Os testes de farmácia est?o cada vez mais seguros e a maioria tem um resultado 99% correto. Além da rapidez do resultado e da praticidade, s?o muito mais baratos que os testes em laboratório. A maioria deles utiliza uma fita que em contato com a urina por 5 minutos <br>  <br>  detecta a presen?a ou n?o do horm?nio da gravidez. Pode ser feito já no 1o dia de atraso menstrual.<br>  <br>  Exame de sangue: é o exame normalmente solicitado pelos médicos em casos de suspeita de gravidez. O processo é feito a partir da análise da taxa do horm?nio HGC presente no sangue. Atualmente, há laboratórios que entregam o resultado no mesmo dia e a probabilidade de acerto é de <br>  99%. Detectam a gravidez em torno de 6 a 8 dias da ovula??o.<br>  <br>  A rede pública de saúde faz o teste de gravidez gratuito. Basta a mulher com atraso menstrual ou suspeita de estar grávida procurar o posto de saúde mais perto de casa<br>  <br>  Como interpretar o resultado do exame:<br>  <br>  VR: NEGATIVO .........: ate 4.9 mUI/mL<br>  INCONCLUSIVO......: 5.0 a 49.9 mUI/mL<br>  POSITIVO..........: Superior a 50.0 mUI/mL<br>  01 a 02 semanas...: 50 a 500 mUI/mL<br>  02 a 03 semanas...: 100 a 5000 mUI/mL<br>  03 a 04 semanas...: 500 a 10000 mUI/mL<br>  04 a 05 semanas...: 1000 a 50000 mUI/mL<br>  05 a 06 semanas...: 10000 a 100000 mUI/mL<br>  06 a 08 semanas...: 15000 a 200000 mUI/mL<br>  02 a 03 meses.....: 10000 a 100000 mUI/mL <br>  <br>  Ultra-som: Se mesmo com os testes acima, você continua cismada, ou eles podem ter falhado, é muito raro, mas pode acontecer...fa?a o ultra-som, com 5 semanas já dá para ver..ai n?o tem erro.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  é bom lembrar, que consultar um ginecologista, é sempre a melhor escolha.<br>  <br>  Une accolade|`|AA12005596	Deus ajude que esteja.|`|6uBhnmGWaa	pode sim minha querida vc fez sexo ent?o tudo é possível|`|QebGccXJaa	Essa mulhereda ta me deixando preocupado..rs.rs.

O transporte dos espermatozóides, inicialmente é rápido alcan?ando a tuba em minutos, mas muitos permanecem em criptas existentes na cerviz uterina, e s?o liberadas de forma continua. Estes espermatozóides mantém sua mobilidade por três dias, alguns acreditam que por até sete dias, mas n?o é claro o que ocorre com a capacidade de fecunda??o. Vários fatores interferem no tempo de sobrevida dos espermatozóides e n?o apenas o fato de estar fora do organismo. Ex. Temperatura, grau de acidez do local, etc. Em um período de 6 horas, em laboratório, o esperma, para ser considerado fértil, apresenta no mínimo 48% de espermatozóides vivos.|`|8a83265f6319dabbbbac92c0a89dcbbeaa	hahahahahahahahaha,<br>  Desculpa, <br>  è q eu imaginei "esperma" na m?o do seu namorado, e um monte de espermatozoidizinhos vestidos de fantasminha.<br>  Eithaaaa imagina??o fertíl essa minha......|`|142b1aab2f576ee2448a664261d35a26aa	oH deus.....<br>  os espermas morrem em kestao de minutinhos <br>  2 no maxiiiiiiiiiimooooooooo|`|92911fecd6af911ba88442b391397d3faa	Ahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|ab86f93453134f4c3df92f94573c73d4aa	aff maria!<br>  <br>  nao é o esperma que morre!<br>  <br>  s?o os espermatozóides!<br>  <br>  o esperma é somente o ambiente em que eles est?o!<br>   e apos cerca de tres horas em contato com o ar eles morrem sim... e lavando, é claro que vai tudo por ralo abaixo!|`|d7068a8080563ae63e342cba1fb16e37aa	Tem pode crer s?o hilanders (hehehe)

DYijN8Hmaa	Sua pergunta é polêmica por natureza. <br>  Entendo que você quer dizer "idade ideal"<br>  1o) Sob o ponto de vista afetivo ==> N?o. Desde que tenha amor pelo filho. <br>  2o) Sob o ponto de vista psicológico e financeiro, a minha resposta vale tanto para a m?e quanto para o pai. ==> A partir do ponto que tiverem adquirido o discernimento necessário para compreender a grande responsabilidade que é "por uma vida no mundo" e ter que renunciar a muitas coisas de suas vidas, principalmente nos primeiros anos de vida da crian?a. Quando estiverem com uma condi??o financeira mínima necessária para prover a crian?a de suas necessidades elementares pelo menos. <br>  3o) sob o ponto de vista físico==> até o limite em que os pais estejam com saúde fisica e mental para acompanhar o desenvolvimento da crian?a e poderem estar ao lado dela durante muitos anos, em condi??es normais é claro.<br>  4o) Sob o ponto de vista biológico ==> m?e : até o início da menopausa se tratando de um filho biológico.<br>  <br>  Observa??es:<br>  1) A minha resposta partiu da premissa da mulher poder escolher o "momento certo". Acontecendo uma gravidez n?o planejada (salvo nos casos de estupro ou risco à vida da m?e), tanto a mulher como o homem devem assumir a crian?a,  dando provas da responsabilidade. Nos casos de estupro ou risco de morte da m?e, fica a cargo da consciência de cada um.<br>  2) Na verdade mesmo, o grande parametro deve ser o velho "bom senso", pois muitas pessoas adquirem maturidade, mais cedo do que a média, conseguem ou herdam dos seus pais uma condi??o financeira confortável desde cedo, ou tem uma condi??o física favorável em rela??o à outras.  Seja qual for a situa??o ou circunstancia uma coisa é essencial: devem ter AMOR pelo filho.|`|1e474a65c99ce869dfd4b756e9a5bd75aa	Sim, existe algum período em que o corpo da mulher pode engravidar. Quando ela menstrua pela primeira vez, quer dizer que o processo de ovula??o e de prepara??o das paredes do útero para receber um feto está acontecendo, ent?o ela pode engravidar sim, se fizer sexo em seu período fértil. Isso varia, podendo come?ar até aos 12 anos, e comumenta inciando aos 14 ou 15. Quanto a idade máxima, isso já varia muito, pois depende da atividade hormonal de cada mulher, pois ao longo da vida, cada uma cuidou de sua vida de uma maneira. A menopausa vem precedida do interrompimento da ovula??o, e este é a hora em que ela n?o mais pode engravidar!!|`|bcgUGd01aa	bom pelo oq eu aprendi na escola hehehehe<br>  desde q a menina tem a primeira mestrua??o ela ja está pronta pois ja iniciou seu ciclo oq significa pode ter filhos jáh ...<br>  agora até idade pode ter filhos ai eu prefiro n?o opnar pq n?o tenho certeza....|`|cPAnNl9raa	Sim existe sim, e é  apartir do momento que a mulher tem saúde para ser m?e, n?o importa, se é muito jovem ou tem muita idade,como a mulher de 67 anos que foi m?e pela primeira vez, o que importa é ter saúde,mas claro, que o ideal é que se tenha equilibrio emocional,mental,saúde física e condi??es financeiras para se ter um filho, e também apoio familiar, apoio das institui??es governamentais, acesso a hospitais,bons médicos,quando necessário,acesso a boa educa??o e condi??es educacionais.Boa alimenta??o,morar em local saudável(casa ou apto em boas condi??es,com acesso a água encanada,potável e esgoto).<br>  Caso contrário,n?o importas se se tem 11 anos ou 67 anos, a mulher e a crian?a sofrer?o muito.Isso sim é que é o fundamenetal!!

Pode ser que ela engravide, como pode ser que n?o.|`|6KtxIXIdaa	há sim porque na realidade a ovula??o de uma mulher ocorre 14 dias depois do 1 dia de menstrua??o se foi 8 dias após significa que s?o 8 mais os dias de menstrua??o que n?o sei quantos foram mais se foram 3 a 4 dias somaram-se 11 a 12 dias o espermatozoide vive por 72 se eu n?o estiver enganada ent?o vcs se tiverem muita sorte mais muita mesmo poder?o n?o ficar gravidos, pois esta regra que estou passando é uma tabelinha que indica que com certeza com este tempo os espermatozoides vivos e ela ovulando  só na sorte mesmo para isso n?o acontecer.|`|e3f006cf54d13030eefff244cfa55815aa	PODE SIM <br>  <br>  da proxima vez usem preservativo|`|er2ldDqXaa	Nilsinho,é muito difícil porque ela tem estava o seu período fértil.<br>  O melhor e vcs esperarem a próxima menstrua??o e se n?o vier aí fazem o teste de gravidez..Abra?os.|`|2sEGyf69aa	Sim, caso ela seja desregulada pode haver a dúvida, o teste Beta já atesta com eficacia, se o bebe estiver a caminho desejo sucesso, pois uma crian?a é a luz que Deus p?em em nossa vida . Boa Sorte!|`|3e35efe7a18909dbe7fcaabb22fba1dbaa	Por isso q eu digo q msm seguindo a tal da tabelinha deve se usar preservativo tbm ...claro q tem chance , pois estava bem proximo do periodo fertil dela. Ai ai ai agora reza|`|AnTriKmlaa	Se n?o se previniram , SIM.|`|ETb0LHGfaa	Haha, tu ta ferrado cara!<br>  brincadeira!<br>  se isso acontecer,será uma ben?a!<br>  abra?o!|`|FUFdbxXAaa	N?o esquenta a cabe?a n?o, n?o tem perigo, só fazer a contagem pelo metódo da tabelinha, mas n?o esque?a todo método possível é pouco para evitar uma gravidez indesejada e só o preservativo evita a contamina??o de DSTs.|`|Ua9EEBFdaa	Grandes chances amigo!! Esperem a mesntrua??o e se n?o vier, parabéns!!|`|lipc1od4aa	Para falar a verdade, tudo depende do ciclo e da ovula??o dela, da sua fertilidade e da RESPONSABILIDADE de vocês.<br>  Uma mulher ovula na metade de seu ciclo menstrual.<br>  Se ela tem ciclo de 28 dias, por exemplo (já que as mulheres podem ter ciclos maiores ou menores), a ovula??o dela ocorrerá no 14° dia depois de cada dia inicial de menstrua??o. Normalmente é perigoso manter rela??es sem prote??o entre os 5 dias anteriores, o próprio dia da ovula??o e os 5 dias posteriores a ela. Ou seja: vocês correm riscos em aproximadamente 11 dias!<br>  Como n?o sabemos durante quantos dias ela menstruou, quantos dias tem o ciclo dela e se vocês usaram algum método contraceptivo, n?o há como afirmar nada.<br>  Mas deveriam come?ar a se preocupar! Além de uma gravidez indesejada, sem prote??o podem acabar contraindo alguma DST.<br>  Há muitos meios contraceptivos, mas a camisinha continua sendo o mais seguro!<br>  Ela é distribuida gratuitamente em postos de saúde!<br>  Nesse caso, é melhor prevenir que remediar!<br>  Cuidem-se!
