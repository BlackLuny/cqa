oyvRHQmaaa	yes ...including what you buy, how much, and how often......|`|yAsLhdp2aa	you bet it is...it is sent to a great big database that includes your DMV records, social security number, bank account info, medical history, political affiliation, email,  myspace account...and all that jazz.  The DMV in SE portland now requires you to scan your fingerprints into your new license, even though the Real ID Act has been ruled unconstitutional in Oregon...it is all so they can track you much easier. passports even have RFID chips in them.  welcome to 1984.|`|1KGXts5Daa	Wow, I had no idea there were this many conspiracy theorists out there.    NO. The "government", nor "big brother" is getting your information from a magnetic strip on your ID when you buy alcohol - or from any other type of consumer transaction.     Anyone suggesting such a thing is either ignorant or insane.    Think about it.  What type of ID is required to show proof of legal age?  "A Government-Issued Photo-Identification" (usually either a driver's license or state ID card issued by the motor vehicle dept., right?? - a government agency)    The "government" already has our information.  We provided it in order to obtain a valid form of ID.  They don't care about us using it to legally purchase alcohol - and no system exists to transfer any information to a government agency about when and where we buy our booze.    Various agencies of local, state and federal government have information about us - usually information we voluntarily provide to them in order to receive something in the form of services, benefits, or privileges.  So what?  The only people that are scared about that are "up to something" and should be avoided.    There is no master database out there with all of our beer purchases and everything else in it - 100% guaranteed!|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Yes|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	sure is|`|983da09dc3ea0ef9d60b736fb7da884eaa	this became a state thing in Florida about July of last year, for instance you used to be able to just look at the person and over ride it by being able to take a good guess, well now the register will NOT allow that action you have to swipe it OR see the id for your self  and punch in the DOB as shown on the ID, some times you are then even asked to punch in the drivers lic. number     But I do wonder what is done with the info that is being collected, it is NOT the stores, as this is a state mandate    EDIT :  I actually asked at work WHY, and was told that the state had deemed it so all the companies registers had to be re done so there was no over ride button / choice any more, I just got blank looks as to WHAT was done with the info, but think that over all it is only as a back up should they come through and check if we sold to under aged people........as a side note I have found several fake ids this way, the worst one being a military id that I was VERY tempted to retain.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Always.|`|8cf795959f4bb56d8c730f6fc0d177dfaa	Depends on the type of device they are using.  The devices I am familiar with give the name, address, date of birth, and driver's license number of the license swiped to be compared with what is actually printed on the license.  It is very common to have incorrect information printed on the front of a fake ID.  Sometimes the identification being presented is not even a driver's license.  I have seen examples of hotel key cards being used to make fake ID's.  Most basic fakes are identified by this very simple technique.    I highly doubt that the state is collecting information about what you bought and when you bought it.  For the most part, this is not useful to them.

KIUJleAkaa	Until our politicians gain the confidence of the working American there will be little benfit from a bail out/vote buying/pork package. I couldn't agree more that we need jobs, but without confidence we will not spend; no spending=no jobs; no jobs means we don't contribute large volumes of federal taxes coupled by unemployment benifit costs which are staggering. Think, no jobs=no tax base, no collected taxes=no government, no government=chaos=rebellions, blah, blah, blah; look at the rest of the world.

Sure, for a few years, you might see a slight recovery, but what this "stimulus" package is doing is like throwing gasoline onto a fire.    You can't save a sinking boat by adding more water to it.|`|KhBmlaefaa	The only informed answer is this, it's a GOVERNMENT STIMULUS. It's not an economic stimulus. You need to read this so-called stimulus, it's very long and stuffed with pork. It's only being made to stimulate government, not stimulate our economy.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	I am not an expert, but i follow the news and the markets....I believe that the mess we're in now will last more than 4 years but will begin to improve toward the end of this year.....it will take a lot more than dumping billions into the system to keep it afloat, but if these billions are not dumped into it...it could take a decade to recover....just my impression and filtering ungodly amounts of daily comments and market movements|`|92gN7RVPaa	Because it has Job creation, housing, as well as tax cuts included, and if the middle class get tax cuts, they will be able to BUY things, therefore causing the economy to prosper.|`|NqNbIp2caa	Our economy is overcapitalized - ie it is capable of producing more than it is.  In order to induce growth we need to get people spending again.  The stimulus package does exactly that by directly spending money in the economy and by putting more money in the hands of those with the highest propensity to spend and the lowest propensity to import.|`|fd270a67b3b8b1479a1e7fcdadd75178aa	By investing in our future.|`|kijIJbBxaa	You are correct. This stimulus package is INSANE, and the fact that Obama is trying to ram it through (using fear) without allowing our officials to review it with careful deliberation just INFURIATES me!! They used similar fear-mongering after 9/11 too to sell Americans on a long, miserable and disastrous war. They have done this on other bailouts and the banker takeover bill too. And here we go again!!!!!!!! We're becoming a bailout culture and the future looks grim.     This issue is so important and Obama's attempts at terrorizing the American people just makes me see red. It's obvious he wants to crash the economy. Ron Paul is the only politician with exceptional intelligence; he knows what he's talking about and should be listened to. He is the one who knows how to truly fix the economy and nobody takes him seriously!!!!!!  I am so ANGRY right now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Read this thing it is  spending on government.     http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext...    Here it is. The people in here supporting this thing are giving mindless parroted comments with no basis in reality.     This thing invests in the government. There are a few things in there with education and helping to promote green projects which is fine. The majority of it equals us spending to make sure the government stays afloat with all its power.|`|O5DZvc0Xaa	Um.... by thoroughly destroying it?    Obviously the intention is not to FIX anything, but to make it worse. Spending and overissuance and DEBT got us into this mess, and the very people who ENGINEERED it.... have now been PUT IN CHARGE of FIXING IT!!!     And they are proposing more public debt, more issuance of currency, and more power to themselves with NO OVERSIGHT... as the "solution."     The goal is to force us to adopt a new monetary system (as well as to impoverish Americans and consolidate everything they own).    It's the biggest transfer of wealth in recorded human history.    Obama fought to get the Bailout passed and now he has the balls to complain to us about its results?    How f***ing dumb is the average American?     A lot of us already know. Let's see how long it takes the rest of them to figure it out.    THE DOLLAR IS BEING KILLED. DELIBERATELY.     GET IT?|`|CNSGz12zaa	It will cost more if we do nothing and wait. The Republicans who caused this disaster are now standing in the way of progress. A lot of the infrastructure they are calling waste is well needed.

They will change their tune quick and vote for the bill in a heartbeat.|`|DUwhR7iyaa	no idea just listened on the news and heard something like this is more money then all the debt of every country but eleven|`|CiDVOEwraa	it won't. It'll make things worse.|`|81Iglngeaa	it wont|`|dH9IhDIFaa	The stimulus package contains provisions for infrastructure projects.  It will create jobs in planning and executing these projects.  (eg jobs for engineers designing roadways, jobs for laborers building roads)   These projects are also designed to drive up domestic demand for steel, concrete, and lumber.  This will create and protect jobs in those industries.    Much of North America's infrastructure is crumbling, and this work is long overdue.|`|AA11928155	I don't feel good about it.

Unless they start giving thousands to every middle class citizen, it will not help.  We need more jobs and job security. People will spend money on their own without any government involvement.  I am beginning to think that a stimulus that is full of pork is just a way of hiding gifts for Lobbyists and rewarding friends who got them elected, under the false pretense of helping the middle class. We were fooled before.
nbibIzC5aa	It would be difficult to catch who ever did it.  Finger print evidence would most likely be the best way to catch the person since not that many people come in contact with the sign and who ever did do it has to know how change the message.    They may also look to see if there are any cameras in the area.  If the sign was located on an interstate or highway it is highly unlikely that there will be a camera.  The other best hope would be that someone comes forward and turns the culprit in.    Is it a crime, probably not but if someone does get hurt because of this practical joke then the person who did it can be sued for negligence.    Hope this helps.|`|jaFwZN8Caa	thats Hilarius|`|FdCALSZ0aa	hahaha cod 5 but they could catch them by finger printing|`|s10ftAczaa	I dont kno if it is possible 2 catch them...if it is they would hav 2 do alot of technological work...but i doubt it.

Therefore if you live in a country and you abide by its laws, you should also try to do your best to learn about it. If there's something wrong with it, you should try to reform it. Otherwise how will your country progress?    Law governs your day to day life. If you know more about it, and the reasons behind certain things it might make your life easier - for example what happens if someone close to you has a accident; you might want to know a few things about negligence/tort laws.    Laws make your country the way it is - if you have laws which most people agree with, then you'll probably have a happy, safe country. If you make laws that only one person agrees with - then you probably live in a totalitarian country.

Asians are all about image.                I just read the other day about how unemployment is really going up in China. Millions of Chinese laborers that have left the countryside have relocated to the city to get work. Well,now many of  those people have been laid off from their jobs.

dYvKr5yeaa	The problem with this question is there is no "American" accent, because there are instead a series of accents that we associate with America, whereas Canadians typically only have the one (unless you're from Newfoundland).  People from Chicago do not sound the same as people from Minnesota.  It's a regional thing because America has such a diverse culture.      You may not hear a difference when talking to your average American on the street, but there's a big difference if you judge yourself against the different sounds in various states, which all wind up under the blanket of "American Accents".|`|CfjxKLHDaa	No, because both Americans and Canadians have different phonetic standards.    All people have accents.  There is no such thing as an "non-accent" accent.  The accent is based on the mixture of audio frequencies produced in your voice box, which is a form of an oscillator.    Additional Comments: Anna S, I was in the UP in 1985 for 40 days and I can clearly hear the UP accent.  There is a difference.  What people in the United States say when "I have no accent" is they are speaking in or close to the Midwestern (central Ohio) accent which is used as the standard American accent.  This accent is aslo the basis for broadcasting (TV and radio) and public announcement accents.  It is used because it can be easily understood by anyone who knows English as compared to heavy NYC or Boston accents.  The UP accent is very close to the standard.|`|kKdUhS2gaa	no im from virginia we have southern accents|`|8ivnzNi5aa	It's "aboot" time somebody asked this question.

56650a55637223b1b968b4235bb50735aa	Absolutely. A teacher is a "school official" and they are charged with not only upholding school and district policies, but also to provide for the safety of all students. Confiscating contraband, prohibited items, or anything a teacher deems as a potential distraction to the overall educational environment is not only legal but should be encouraged and supported by parents, other students, and the local community.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Yes.  One of a teacher's jobs is to maintain discipline in the classroom.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, if they have a policy of no cell phones (for example) they can confiscate them.  And also look through them.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	Yes.  High school kids have few rights......if any|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Yes they can.

This was Gibson's A-HA question. In all fairness, he did go on to elaborate: The Bush doctrine, as I understand it, is that we have the right of anticipatory self-defense, that we have the right to a preemptive strike against any other country that we think is going to attack us. Do you agree with that?"     Palin's reply was right on the money: "If there is legitimate and enough intelligence that tells us that a strike is imminent against American people, we have every right to defend our country. In fact, the president has the obligation, the duty to defend."    [Edit to add] Also, Sarah Palin never said "I can see Russia from my house". That was a line by Tina Fey in an SNL skit The actual quote is "They're our next-door neighbors and you can actually see Russia from land here in Alaska -- from an island in Alaska."|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Charlie Gibson sure as hell didn't know.  Preemptive strikes are not part of the Bush doctrine.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	I'm not a Palin fan, but when she was asked, the question was loaded.

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Yes, there was evidence of an impending coup led by Cuban-supported communists against the democratic government.  There was also a plan to hold the US med students hostage-to extract political leverage from the US.    Urgent Fury had two goals then:  1- Rescue the med students and evacuate  2- Assist the democratic gov't to resist the Cuban-backed insurgents.  Both were achieved with very little bloodshed,on both sides.  Grenadians are STILL very grateful to the US military, as a few friends of mine found out when they were down there on vacation.  EDIT:  Chris makes an EXCELLENT point:  Both Jamaica and Barbados urged the US to take action and volunteered forces, and facilities to help out.|`|0c91b79437b0e602213a070c2fc739d0aa	On the island is a medical school (St. George's), a good number of Americans attend school there.  The government of Grenada called upon the U.S. to rescue them from the Cuban military which had begun a take over of the island.  President Reagan agreed and launched a strike to rid the island of the Cuban military presence and to rescue the American med. school students.|`|q4KgxrfEaa	dont forget jamaica and barbados also aligned with the us and sent troops to help.|`|hcnC7erIaa	The reason for "invading" is pure and simple: it was a convenient target to distract the US public from the colossal cockup that had just occurred in Lebanon.    There was no military or even inherent political reason.  The medical students were an ad hoc (almost post hoc!) reason - they were never under any threat.  The "Cuban military" were indeed Cuban military forces: Cuba had been renting their engineers out for construction projects throughout the world for decades.  They still do.  So does the US...

bA0sLHnlaa	Dictatorships are always more efficient than democracies.   How else could Stalin and Hitler kill millions so efficiently?|`|L4eoLmvJaa	a dictatorship might be more efficient, but efficiency isn't everything|`|trMsK86jaa	Neither is more effective or efficient really - what democracy loses in focus it makes up for with consistent effort.    What dictatorships lose in solidarity (after a long period of time) they make up for in inherited power for the next generation.    Neither is a truly Balanced system, i feel.    edit; Doug; By fooling people into thinking they were supporting a good thing, of course.    That's just manipulation.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	A dictatorship is more effective, one guy's rules that everyone follows. But of course, god bless the citizens!|`|90tPT5nlaa	In the short term a (benevolent) dictatorship is more efficient, as major improvements can be made quickly without a lot of consultation, education of the population, caring for affected minorities etc - see Singapore as an example. In the long run though only a democracy will generate the most benefit for its people, even though it has its ups, downs and false starts along the way.|`|64SObnr5aa	I live in China as a transplanted American and see how a one party system works.    Despite what pundits say, there is an election system in place, however, one must be a member of the party to vote which numbers about 70 million people.    A one party system seems to be pretty efficient in getting this done and putting vital issues on the fast track.  Such as infrastructure to modernizing their military, which parts of it are as ancient as pre WWII.     The problem of course is corruption, of which the current president has made it a top priority to weed out.  Yet it is so ingrained that that dream will be next to impossible, all he can do is put up as many roadblocks as possible to stop the greasing of palms. While prosicuting those that go too far to put a message out there, that we are watching.    This country is not dictatorial, it is authoritarian, but for the most part the average Chinese is not affected.  These people are amazingly apathetic and I suspect the reason is they have more freedom then anytime in their history and are grateful for that.    Our perception in the west is we never give the Chinese any credit for that, all we do is look for wrong and that is very disingenuous.    As the book, Doing Business in China, by Robert Collins says:  You should give the Chinese some credit where its due  dragging millions out of poverty and overhauling a plodding centrally-planned economy.Chinese society today faces many strains and has plenty of growing pains. Dont hold this against the Chinese  theyre doing a pretty good job when you look at the challenges they face.    To answer your question, a dictatorship is less affective because it works by fear, in time that will all come undone.  An authoritarian government, in some instances is desirable, especially when it wants to get things done for its people.  A pure democracy is mob rule and no one wants that.  A constitutional republic democracy is desirable for some societies and others it will create chaos, such as Iraq and Afghanistan that have never in their history had anything less then authoritarian governments.    There is no one size fits all system.  Our two wars should have taught us that lesson.    The best thing we can do is lead by example, yet the Bush doctrine of preemptive action laid that to rest and we can no longer claim that till we reverse that.    Pre WWII there were less then a dozen countries that claimed democratic values, now there are over 100. Democracy, despite its problems was doing pretty well on its own.  Now we are no longer leading by example, but rather leading out of the barrel of a gun.    We really need to get away from the one size fits all type governments and treat and respect governments that are the polar opposite of ours, even if it goes against our core values.     Peace  Jim    .|`|9OdnYM0daa	It is quite odd, I was recently debating the subject. I was for the promotion of dictatorships. A dictatorship has many obvious pros and cons.     Pros:    A dictator is the only one in control. He can make decisions in a fraction of the time a democracy can, making it able to pass needed laws, provide emergency aid, and react swiftly in rapidly changing situations. It is also quite cheaper. In a democracy you must contend with the cost and wages of the government's employees. My source, though long is very descriptive.    Cons:  Only one man is in charge. If he is corrupt and vile, he will quickly destroy the country. They will also pass by human right laws to further their own goals. Finally, they won't explain their causes, often causing disruptions. Again, view the source. It can explain the question much more than any one person can.

6BTvuPwcaa	I would definitely call the cops!  Tell them that he has threatened your life, and that you don't feel safe.  They could run his name, maybe he has warrants for something and he could get locked up in enough time for you to contact the district attorney and file a protective order.  Make sure you are getting EVERYTHING on tape.  And that you are making a report at the police station every time this guy confronts you.  You never know when people are going to flip!!  Read this.

They are ignorant stupid people hoping to scare you into eating those damages and not holding them accountable for their misbehaving son.    For threatening your life - Go to the police and file a police report.  File a police report for the property damages if you have not done this.    DO NOT invite them back to your home.  If the damages are significant you may need to get an attorney involved or send them a certified letter.  Along with video keep detailed notes.    These type of people you will have to sue and go to court.  Watch court TV.    If he puts his hands on you sue him for that also.  However, do defend yourself.  Most people who "yell and scream" are not trying to get into a fight.  They are just trying to be intimidating. don't let it work.    If you have to file charges on the kid do that also.|`|M0ZDvXrAaa	small claims court and a restraining order.......and more cameras!|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Those people have got big time issues.

These people will make any and all threats against anyone who brings police, particularly to their home. And although they may know that you have them on camera, they may carry out their threats and remove the evidence.     You may think this is crazy, but it may be how certain crime groups maintain control. Don't assume you have protection from the police unless you alert DEA and FBI and explicitly ask for protection.

But "equal justice under the law" doesn't exist in the United States.    I guess that the politicians don't have to pay the huge taxes that they saddle us with.

gasquENMaa	Outside of cult leaderships, there has never been any accreditation given to fusion, either in existence or application. This particular aspect has been something that cults have used very successfully over the years, getting persons to believe that they were very special and entitled to this  only when they belonged and believed in what the cult was preaching. The beauty of fusion groups is that when the person actually didn't achieve fusion, the leaders made the person believe it was THEIR  fault for not being a true member. This only made the member pay more money up front to help themselves in achieving fusion.     The specific answer to your question is NO, they really do not exist.

Problem is, his words are meaningless.|`|IJTcGIG7aa	Abortions went down during Clinton's administration more so than during Reagans (they went up drastically) or G.W.Bush's (there was a slight increase).    Did Clinton do anything to stop them?   Nope.    Reagan did, and failed.  Bush did, and failed.    The President can't stop abortions - only people can.   The economy is actually a bigger factor than any law, and that's the real reason for the huge decline during Clinton's term.    If you don't want to have abortions....don't do it then.    If you find a way to stop everyone else without trampling freedoms, then let us know....cause I don't think anyone is ready for:    - police officers in OB/GYN visits    - government monitoring of medical records    - prosecutors reviewing every miscarriage as a crime scene    - And the Bush girls will still just fly to Europe, so it only applies to the poor|`|2s5cXFTQaa	abfabmom you are so wrong he most defiantly does support abortion. His very words were and I quote "I will teach my daughters morals and I will do my best to raise them right, but if they make a mistake I wont make them suffer for the rest of their lives." Actually he supports partial birth abortion as well. And agreed that if a baby didn't die then they were to be locked in a utility closet till death occurred. And I defiantly agree with Altair 1 he loves to listen to himself talk, but unfortunately he doesn't make any sense.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	It defies logic.

Why do you pick something out of context and not report what the article said, or did you not read the article. How about posting the  rest of what Obama said?     "There is no god who condones taking the life of an innocent human being, and all religions teach people to love and care for one another. That is the common ground underlying the faith-based office.      Obama established a White House office of faith-based initiatives with a broader mission than the one overseen by Bush.  The office will work with nonprofit secular and faith-based organizations and will help them determine how to make a bigger impact in their cities. These organizations will make community groups an integral park of the economic recovery and will not come from the government alone.      A Pentecostal minister has been picked to head this organization and 25 religious and secular leaders have been appointed to the new advisory board.     Ira C. Lupu, a professor at the George Washington University School of Law said:  He's signaling, 'We are going to take more seriously than the Bush people did the constitutional concerns about what it is the government may or may not directly support with government money,'"|`|WlDVd92paa	O.k.

At all...anywhere.  Please, do a little research and get your facts straight.    What he DOES support is the Supreme Court's prior decision that says medical privacy falls within definition of our constitutional right to privacy.  If you have even a small understanding of how our government works, you'll know that this is really the only stance he can take.  No president has the right to overturn a Supreme Court decision, and every president is supposed to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States", according to their oath of office.    There's nothing in this argument that addresses ANYONE'S opinions on the right or wrong of abortion.  It's simply an issue of our government supporting the document that provides us all with the rights that we're so happy to have.    Edit:  For  1SoxFan...You've just proven my point.  He doesn't support it, but accepts it as reality.|`|Awfde2oKaa	because he talks outta both sides of his mouth..

MDYZIgwCaa	You are somewhat correct.    Though the illegals are breaking the sanctity of this great nation by crossing over illegally, the employers are largely to blame.    By hiring illegals, who are willing to work for ridiculously low wages, they encourage illegal immigration. We need stricter laws on this matter. As of now, employers are fined for hiring illegals. Yeah... Great. That'll teach 'em to not hire illegals...    But seriously, those who hire illegals should serve some time in prison. This is a great nation. Illegal immigration is so unfair to families like my own that have crossed over legally. It is SO unfair to those who are natural-born citizens of this wonderful country!! It is SO unfair to those who went through the effort to become naturalized citizens!!    It is unfair! Period.    P.S. NAFTA was passed under the Clinton administration. However, the fact of the matter is, the Bush administration did not discontinue this. It is mostly Clinton's fault. However, it is also Bush's fault. They are both to be blamed.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Keeping the tax rate on business high (35%) is what causes business to ship jobs overseas.

Look at Michigan, Granholm is taxing companies to death and daily there are more leaving the state and creating some of the highest levels of unemployment in the state's history. Do you really want to continue this on a national level?

You have to get the money where the money is. That's just simple mathematics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    As far as jobs going overseas. Our previous president is to blame for that. The debt he created and the spending he did is primarily responsible for the recession we are in. Because of that companies cannot afford to do business here  and have to go where wages, production, and manufacturing is cheaper.|`|0ACcsLKHaa	Well i for one am not rich and am more conservative then EVEN todays republicans.    A true republican believes government is an evil nescesity. we must have as little of it as possible.    A true republican cherished freedom over equality, as opposed to a democrat or liberal who believes everyone should be more equal instead of free.    Aka the great society and welfare by Lyndon Johnson.    A perfect example of someone who believes in taking money out of someones hard earned pay check in order to make the minority better off.     I believe charity should be that, just charity. not forced taxs, on hard working people wether its lower or upper class.    Dont confuse republicans with push overs :)      and as far as jobs over sea's.    well as you know its cheaper to pay someone in india 2 cents an hour then someone here for 8 dollars an hour.    so what do u think would happen if nike stopped out sourcing? well the cost of there shoes would be more expensive. If more money is spent on labor the cost of the shoes would be more expensive, otherwise they wouldnt make any profit      Heres a little list i got for you to show how many companies have jobs over sea :)    3Com  3M     A  Aalfs Manufacturing  Aavid Thermal Technologies  ABC-NACO  Accenture   Access Electronics   Accuride Corporation  Accuride International  Adaptec  ADC  Adobe Systems  Advanced Energy Industries  Aetna  Affiliated Computer Services  AFS Technologies   A.G.

AA11494150	Spill back is when you get hung up in the intersection when the light turns red, so the opposing traffic with a green is obstructed by your vehicle, creating a situation called "gridlock".     Our department has no requirement for the officer to identify himself, I suspect that is a myth from television and movies.

And If UK doesn't want to be a part of EU you can get out and become a 52 state of USA or whatever EU really doesn't need you.  What happens if EU would to break up is relevant to why it would break up. If member states would not feel the need to have it any more than nothing happens. If it would break up because of territorial claims or national claims then war would ensue.  But most likely EU would only be transformed back to a only economic union instead of political union.  But anything of this happening would be a precedence all throughout history economic unions became political and those than con/federations and then a state.  Just look at Germany (and it wasn't one nation empire for most of the time). From Holy Roman Empire through German economic union then Prussia took the lead and transform that to German empire (that stayed till ww1)...|`|yb4FbFiSaa	My guess is people would go to war for the usual reasons: to claim land and resources.

IJTcGIG7aa	Here are the most common ways the economy is stimulated:    Consumers buy stuff....but they can't now cause everyone is broke.    Businesses hire people or invest in new things....but they can't cause they are even worse off.    The government/federal reserve bank changes the interest rate and or bond markets or other tools to tweak the economy.....but everything here has been exhausted (the fed rate is about zero right now).    The only thing that is left is spending......having the government spend so much that businesses make a profit, hire people, those people buy more stuff....and so on and so on.    This is how we got out of the Great Depression - reckless spending during WWII.    If you examine the Great Depression you'll see that Roosevelt would have got us out of it in the 1930's, but he cut back on spending....and our economy sank back into its long depression.   Only the all out spending for the war changed that.    One final note.....how a dollar is spent matters.    Tax cuts that favor the rich will do nothing to stimulate the economy - because it will go into bank accounts and be invested....not spent.    Actual government spending - buying roads and bullets and street signs and a new federal building somewhere.....is shown to return 150% on everything spent.   Meaning, this type of spending has a lot more effect than even tax cuts to the poor, etc.    .............................    Alternatives, from the answer above:    1. Make the 2001 and 2003 Tax Cuts permanent, instead of raising taxes in 2011; Reduce Marginal Tax Rates for Individuals and Businesses by 10% creating new jobs. Adopting just this one proposal would create between 500,000 and 1 million jobs in one year.  (Retarded....did these tax cuts prevent the crash?   Nope, they caused it and also the 5 TRILLION in debt Bush racked up during GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES.    How does a TAX CUT reduce our national debt?   How is it different than spending?  This is beyond retarded.....and doesn't even matter till 2011....hopefully things change by then.  ).    2. Repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax & reduce the Death Tax to 15% ($5 mil. individual exclusion) Enact long-term reforms and budgets for entitlement spending., putting long-term obligations from Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, front and center in the budget process.  (Alt minimum tax is a token thing that will be done regardless.   The death tax applies to very few people....it will do NOTHING to stimulate the economy to give Paris Hilton more money.).       3. Assess and enforce long term spending rules in Congress. Get us out of debt!  (This worked great for Herbert Hoover...it caused the Depression, and definitely wasn't a concern of the far right when Bush was spending money.   Republicans want to be fiscal conservative now that Democrats pick where to spend money).|`|TsjqzanQaa	Well, they're going to pass the highest spending bill in history.    This will mean that it will raise the national deficit.    It will give Congress the biggest opportunity to rig it so that their cronies and special interests can be at the head of the line to get the lion's share of the loot.    Those in Congress who are on the take can get record-breaking bribes and kickbacks, and under-the-table payments.    Crooked contractors and others will also make record-breaking profits, something like Bush/Cheney's cronies in Haliburton, who got one hundred billion dollars of our money.    Whatever they can't rig to go to special interests and cronies will be wasted, in the same way that our government wastes most of our tax dollars.    And the politicians won't even pay their own taxes!!!    They don't feel that they should have to pay the same huge taxes that they saddle us with!!      Look at Obama's recent appointments!        He's even keeping the tax-dodger Geithner, even though he admitted making a mistake with Daschle!!     Obama's a hypocrite.    And then, in the future, we will have to pay for all of this, and taxes will be raised to record heights.       Noone in government ever reduces the colossal waste---they just want to tax us to death.    Perhaps Obama's intentions are good, but the "road to Hell is paved with good intentions."    Government will waste the money; they always do.    They don't help out the Americans who are in danger of losing their homes, they only help out friends and cronies, failed and incompetent fatcat executives and pork projects.    Business as usual in D.C.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Join the club.

6874b8b3cb063bdf81c157c6f38415b4aa	You are incorrect. It is not lawful for two minors under age of consent to engage in sex. However because both are minors in most cases neither party is charged. Furthermore if an adult is aware of these acts he/she could be charged with crimes. Since I am correcting you I wont be waiting for Best Answer nomination :)|`|AA11993638	In some states yes it is illegal and the older of the two individuals can be charged with a sex crime even if both individuals are under 16. It all depends on the state in which you live. So never ASSUME you know the answer. You will have to research your states laws on this issue.|`|AA11277845	It depends on your state laws, and in most states the difference in age matters if both are minors (e.g. illegal for 17 year old to have sex with 13 year old).
dbd8bedc1820878658fc63ada79927e9aa	good question i haven't heard whether or not they have told him and i've been following this from the start.i have wondered it myself. i wouldn't think that they would have told him , that could kill him.
c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	No you do not. Why would they be required to have licensed medical staff? Even having certified personnel to do CPR, while smart of them is not something that a patron should expect. It is highly doubtful that they would attempt CPR and definitely not a defibrillator without the proper certification.   You say you think the response time was inadequate. In what way? Did the staff delay calling for help? Did they have a qualified person available but chose not to make them available? From your story it sounds like the answer is no.  And it is occurred not incurred.  Creative writing takes practice.|`|5b9d75acf8c31110fcdbe2289558b613aa	No sounds like you do not.  They are protected under the good Samaritan act or law.    This is usually why people refuse to offer assistance in an emergency.      I know exactly how you feel, but it sounds like they did the best they could.|`|OiUxoqcPaa	You could always hire a lawyer to do some fact-finding and see if there is a case, but you'd have to pay the lawyer.  Anyway, you'll just have to accept that we all will die one day, whether it's on the golf course, dancing the Irish jig, riding a bicycle, flying a plane as a flight instructor, having just returned from the dentist office, by a cancer, by old age, or something else. BTW, all of these, I know the people who have died that way.  It's very sad, but true.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Unless you can prove the golf course staff did something negligently or did something that aggrevated your dad dying there is nothing that can be done because he died of a natural cause.  The golf course staff would not have had to do anything on your father as they are not required by law to do so.  You're lucky they tried to help him at all.|`|FjwdmI0oaa	On the  1 Tee there is always people waiting to tee off.I doubt if he laid there long with no one there trying to help him. You will need to check the state laws to see what the course need to do. and what cpr training is needed by there personnel.Most golf courses are owned buy the city's good luck trying to take them to court.As they say they say they did all they could as quickly as they could,You will need to prove they did something wrong.|`|oFcrglxzaa	it's better that dieing in a hospital or nursing home, what could the golf course do they are not trained medical assistants, if your dad were to here this he'd say, hey forget about it, I am in a better place|`|yWUQUjx9aa	Your father died doing something he loved to do.  The people there made their best effort to help him.  You do not have a lawsuit.  Their is no lawyer who would take this up on your behalf.  I am sorry for your loss. It could be that your grief is clouding your judgment but this question is really ridiculous.|`|AA11920282	agreed with the first person. they did what they could to help him and i'm guessing some random person wouldn't be able to pick up the machine and use it   so they had to have some kind of training. i know if i picked up a defibrillator and tried to use it i would have clue what was about to happen. if anything you should be thanking them at the golf course for taking such quick actions and having the ambulance there so quickly. all said and done your father died of something that wasn't caused by anyone else in a place that he voluntarily went to so there should be no chance of a law suit at all. you shouldn't be so quick to jump on the "lets sue them" bandwagon and give things time to settle down and clear up.|`|aC5yIcvqaa	I am sorry for your sudden loss of your father.  Not having time to prepare yourself makes it even harder.  A friend of mine lost his father to a heart attack suddenly a few years ago.  The question rather than do you have a case may be, would your father have wanted this situation involving his death to result in a lawsuit of the golf course?|`|nbibIzC5aa	First off, I am sorry for your loss.  There maybe a lawsuit if an attorney can discover if the staff did not have proper training using the defibrillator.  Did they perform CPR correctly?  Did they cause more damage to your father than help him?  How much medical equipment did the golf club have?  Was it in good condition?  Were there any safety procedures in place?  Did they follow those procedures?      You should talk to an attorney will help you ease your pain and will be able to tell you whether or not you have a case.    Hope this helps.|`|e81f5e9fdac66f6ab45eb4396a39fb24aa	Your father didn't collapse in a hospital emergency room - he collapsed on a golf course - the fact that anyone there was able to render aid, start CPR, and use an automated defibrillator was his absolute best chance at recovery.    I'm not surprised that no one can give you exact times for each thing - they weren't doctors, nurses or EMT's - they were laymen who really didn't have alot of experience with situations like that and they were probably extremely traumatized by that.  A minute probably felt like an hour to them.    They did render aid.  They did have a defibrillator on site, which legally they needed to be trained to use.  Even having a defibrillator it is only a tool in an attempt to revive someone - it is not a cure.    I am sorry for your loss - but you really have no recourse against hte golf course over this.  They weren't medical personnel- they did what they could.  There is no law, nor expectation that a golf course have medical personnel on site.  Having staff that was CPR capable and knew how to use the defibrillator was more than anyone could have expected.

AA11494150	Many patrol vehicles have cameras. If so, you can request a copy of the video through Open Records law.    If there is no video, then it will come down to the officer's testimony. Officers are almost always given high credibility in court, so his testimony alone is usually enough for the courts to convict.    You didn't mention where you are from , but you will want to check your traffic laws. If the light turned red while you were still in the intersection, that could be a violation. Running a yellow light could also be a violation, unless you were so close you couldn't stop safely.      Contrary to some other posts, the chance the officer will not show is slim. My department gets a minimum of 2 hours at the overtime rate for court, some departments in my area get 4. A case like this would take 10 to 15 minutes, so it is easy money. If the officer has a good reason to miss, they will reschedule.     You may want to consider asking the court clerk if they offer any diversionary programs to keep it off your record, such as traffic school or community service.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	Find out when the cops day off is, schedule your case for that day, he can't argue the ticket, there you go.

AA11494150	A plea of "no contest" can not be used against you in a civil proceeding.     However, there is no guarantee you will be successful. A successful lawsuit requires two things: Negligence and damages.     You could argue damages, but negligence may be difficult. If the officers actions were reasonable, there is no negligence.    I can't answer what is "reasonable", because I don't have all the information. However, I can tell you impairment by drugs is quite common, so simply passing the breath test means very little. The fact they are even offering a plea instead of dropping charges completely makes me wonder if there is more to the story. Most importantly, do you take medication for your MS, and will that medication affect your driving? ADA protection does not extend to driving under the influence of medication.

4kEuzSpkaa	A big NO, and I've just signed the petition.    The government have been twisting themselves into knots for a long time now, trying to justify id cards and have failed to do so on almost every level. ID cards will do nothing to combat the threat of terrorism. In fact considering the high risk of identity theft they will probably make it easier for terrorists to operate. For similar reasons, ID cards will do nothing to combat benefit fraud and will do nothing to combat illegal immigration.    The National ID card scheme is little more than an open invitation for criminals to steal your identity. With the right software, hackers will be able to crack ID card security in minutes and the wheels are already in motion to enable them to do so.    Then of course, there's the incompetence factor. If the government are as lax with the id card database as they were with the child benefit one and various others since, everybody will be at great risk of having their identity stolen and criminals will be able to get access to all your details, accounts, e.t.c, even if those details are not actually held on the card.    The fact is that even some top members of the government are now having second thoughts. Alistair Darling for one, is well known to oppose the id card scheme. Although Gordon Brown himself still seems to favour the idea, I suspect that serious doubts are being expressed by various members of the cabinet. This is why rather than making them compulsory for everyone as they originally planned, they are now attempting to introduce them in more palatable stages. How long will it be, however, until we are all forced to carry one by law?    So what are ID cards actually for? The government have already stated that they will sell the data from the national ID database to third party companies in order to pay for the cost of the scheme. So, I suspect the real reason this government has in mind for ID cards is to gather marketing information, so that businesses can inundate us with "targeted" spam and junk mail.    In the future, however, who is to say that an even more unethical government couldn't use ID cards as a very sinister means to limit our freedom and our right to privacy?    No doubt, some pro-ID card person will defend them with the "nothing to hide, nothing to fear" argument. This, however, does not stand up to close scrutiny. If we have nothing to hide, why would the authorities want to intrude into every aspect of our lives and keep tabs on us all? Honest, upstanding citizens must never be treated like criminals. Besides, it has now become obvious that whether we have nothing to hide or not, the government cannot be trusted with our personal details.    And to add insult to injury the government wants people to buy their own ID card, at an estimated cost of between 100 and 300 per card. So a family of four might have to shell out as much as 1,200 simply so that the government can keep tabs on them, sell their details in order to target marketing at them and expose them to a high risk identity fraud.    This ridiculous ID card scheme is completely unacceptable and must be opposed at all costs. I refuse to carry an ID card under any circumstances. If we all did the same, the scheme would fall down around the government's ears and they might just see sense.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	No|`|f1aa4b48e29847dd1850b63dadd969cdaa	NONONONONONONONNONONONONONNONONNONONONON...|`|ab37b6bdb0bbbf15c8bbba9c3715bb8faa	The ideology put about by this government is that if you have done nothing wrong you have nothing to fear. This is the usual stunt of confusing the issue which is nothing to do with that idea. ID Cards are just another way of this government keeping an eye on you and what you do. Remember the 7/7 bombers would all have been entitled to ID cards as they were British born.Former heads of M.I. 5 have pointed out that they will do nothing to prevent terrorism which is the sole reason for their existence.|`|E9yH3tWMaa	While they are conceptually sound, ID cards rely on current and future government not to abuse the information they contain. Sadly, the expression 'I am a politician, trust me' has never inspired confidence so the less power given to the state, the better.    Most people have fairly reliable forms of identification in passports, driving licenses, bank and credit cards etc. If the purpose of ID cards is to prevent benefit fraud, this could be effected by a more robust use of the unique National Insurance numbers that all UK subjects are allocated.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	A big NO.|`|jtPzPhHCaa	More to the point - WHY??

I'm sure that the lack of an ID card is going to stop some backpacking radical from planting their bomb or the local tealeaf breaking into my house.|`|AA11500002	No - and no to all the rest of New McLabours 'Stasi' measures.|`|t27SvIPbaa	You have to understand that most people will be queueing up for one after the next planned so called terrorist attack.  They will bomb their own people again (just like 9/11 & 7/7) to keep the masses in fear so that they will give up their freedom and liberty for so called security.

It is time to remove the governments and civil servants and big business leaders who seek to foist these controls on us.    These things don't spring out of the blue. Companies like, for example our biggest UK telecoms supplier, pay people to come up with these ideas and then pay others to promote the ideas to the government and then conspire with others to establish standards for these things behind our backs and all so they can reap the profits when all the records and card readers have to be networked.

So I am not that worried.|`|YwdsP4c2aa	I think they would be disastrous. How do we prove who we are in order to get one? We would have to have a way of doing that, to get one in the first place and if we've got that way of proving who we are already, then we don't need an ID card. So it must just be a Government excuse to find out loads more information about us.

oMOiAFRBaa	Obama is the most divisive president in recent American history.  Proof?  More democrats voted for Bush's Iraq war and voted for Bush's Wall Street bailout than Republicans voted for Obama's pork-laden stimulus bill.    Barack Obama's BS platitudes and teleprompter speeches may easily fleece the masses, but I'll bet he wasn't counting on the audience in the Republican wing of the congress actually having an education, and, as a result, not falling for his garbage.|`|QziBNh0Uaa	No. America was divided way before the beginning of his presidency.|`|b22d8ccedb447bfcc30483c3590f81f3aa	YES HE DID|`|6DORuAFDaa	YES HE HAS!!!!!!|`|AA11370645	You know, I tried to embrace the prospect of having Obama as president.

He will call them into his office & let them know that he knows they didn't pay their taxes & he's let them get back to work but as they turn to go back to work he will also say "oh, yeah that little boy you sleep with is something you can't do again" they will go back to work & never disrespect him again, you watch the man is a winner.|`|6eoMqJF0aa	YES HE HAS|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	Let me put it this way: If you want Gitmo open I don't WANT you in my country!|`|Un986lZnaa	all of the above and more

mFa5ZDtcaa	This bill is absolutely necessary if not critical to his Presidency. He made the fatal mistake of not putting a short leash on Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats when they wrote this thing. He should have said "Keep it simple, stupid, we will worry about the other **** in a few months." Instead, he let them pass a $826,000,000,000.00 spending orgy. Now he is stuck with it and the Senate is only adding to it. (About another $100,000,000,000.00 at last check).  I guess it's just in there nature. Any bill can be made better with sufficient spending.    The public is beginning to wake up and see this thing for what it is: the biggest and worst spending bill in the history of the US.     One major problem: people can't see where their stimulus is in this thing.    If it tanks, he is going to get plastered and will have to wear this thing like a dead albatross around his neck the rest of his Presidency.|`|SU8Dv2ZAaa	I think that he thinks that we're all idiots.|`|3d8e98f7d2a40f8f0c137d99beb195b1aa	What a joke.

They need to drop the capital gains tax in half which would make the stock market go up radically, offer low interest loans to those who are losing their homes, loan money to the states whose economy is in the tank, stop the H1B program for a while, and do something to offer the hope he was so famous for before the election.  No more bailouts to banks, etc.  They waste it.  Let them scrimp like everybody else.

Cheat = A corrupt legal system that perpetuates crime as a growth industry and uses legal trickery  such as registration to impose stealth tax and reduce freedoms.  Steal = creating debt to steal our endevours by fractional reserve banking and supporting criminal central banks which create 'money' from fresh air and charge us interest on it.    OR IN OTHER WORDS ,Lie,cheat and steal.
VWwepyibaa	Yup Bush and Obama would be one in the same under Obama's logic of thinking|`|I6dcRgD6aa	No, they are opposites. Bush's religion was about creating Stepford wives or people. Obama's is about everyone being empowered. Bush was out to rob the country & he came into office with about a trillion dollars of our money & it disappeared & no one said anything. Then he tricked people into going to war by threatening & we would have been in trouble if he didn't follow through on his threat. Then I remember thinking that the dems would be blamed but what he did next was to say they would be right back home. I wanted Hillary to just say Yes since they were coming back home. Everyone forgot though. Bin laden made his money from construction so they all go together cause rich boys with no challenges had to something big. So construction contracts bills charged to the American taxpayers. So another trillion dollars is missing & now republicans are worried about us spending money that will circulate in our own country.

Preventing STDs means less burden on the health system because there will be less people to treat. Less of a burden on the health department means it will keep our taxes down in the long run.    Fact is, I'm glad Obama finally called out how tax cuts is all we've been hearing the last 8 years. I understand and appreciate that he is trying to reach across the aisle, but BI-PARTISANSHIP means meeting in the middle. Not having the other side give in to your demands.     And while it is childish to say, the fact is yes, Obama won the election, which means the majority of the country agreed with his vision for the next four years, not the Republicans. That doesn't mean we shouldn't have a reasonable opposition that just doesn't use the same old fear tactics and hollow statistics.|`|AA11600810	I'll answer that question just as soon as you can tell me how throwing money at STD's will create jobs.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Because tax cuts are a proven method of stimulating an economy.

Review where all the BS is going.|`|4rfEWg1qaa	this is a complex issue & whether or not tax cuts work cannot be judged by the last 8 years exclusively. Ronald Regan gave tax cuts to the rich, and it did work for the economy b/c the people who had money could then afford to reinvest in the stock market and expand business creating jobs that helped the middle class. i wish that people would actually learn about things on their own rather than relying on the media to tell them what to think. geez.    oh and "reality has a liberal bias" uh. YES tax cuts DO fix bridges! b/c when the rich spend less on their taxes the middle class income increases, which enables another class of people to pay taxes, which, in turn, fix bridges. lol!    oh, and, john above, the rich people in america pay over half of all the taxes in america, and they are also the ones who invest in america which helps america. the "tax cuts" to the working poor are not "cuts" they are "credits" b/c those people end up not paying taxes at all once they get their refund from the IRS. In fact, they end up taking some of the tax money paid by the rich. So the next time you get an earned income credit, that mr.moneybags, b/c w/ out the rich, you  would not get sh*t|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	lol the republicans are fact free?  you think the economical problem may have started with billy clinto when he forced the banks to issue home loans to people who could not afford them   may have been the problem?  or are you so ignorant that you can not listen to anything unless it comes from your media MSNBC?  learn the facts and then do your complaining|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	The liberal democrat answer to any problem is to increase taxes.|`|aMkLPOOeaa	are you serious? look at all the pork the loons in the dem. party put in that bill. how does giving hollywood movie producers 250 million to buy film create jobs? maybe a few rich actors make a few million more|`|4bb99c41576ff3f2f8e3b5fc75e5945baa	The republican tax cuts give bigger tax cuts to low income than the Democrats plan.

Tax cuts give the rich, and anyone else for that matter, more money to spend. Rich people must be doing something relater to business to have the money in the first place so now they have more money to spend on business and employ more people. With higher taxes there is less money to spend because it is taken to be given to others.

That is like saying a black man has no rights in the bank.|`|hmyo6qdRaa	no it isn't theft. if the teacher takes it and runs away, it's theft; however, the teacher has no right to take it.|`|AA12009752	actually funny you should ask yes it is theft is under section 322 under the criminal code of canada it says it is 1) Every one commits theft who fraudulently and without colour of right takes, or fraudulently and without colour of right converts to his use or to the use of another person, anything, whether animate or inanimate, with intent     (a) to deprive, temporarily or absolutely, the owner of it, or a person who has a special property or interest in it, of the thing or of his property or interest in it;    (b) to pledge it or deposit it as security;    (c) to part with it under a condition with respect to its return that the person who parts with it may be unable to perform; or    (d) to deal with it in such a manner that it cannot be restored in the condition in which it was at the time it was taken or converted.    Time when theft completed    (2) A person commits theft when, with intent to steal anything, he moves it or causes it to move or to be moved, or begins to cause it to become movable.    Edit: i see everyone write that it is ok since it is in the school policy but it is still against the law who cares about the school policy this is a crime commited its in the criminal code and should be followed theres no exemption for the school not to follow it, Agreed?|`|WrDGhduxaa	Students will bring things to school that are forbidden, so the teacher will take it from them.  Depending on the object it may be returned after school, or the parents may have to come to the school to get it, or it may be given to the police.  Students do not have normal civil rights at school.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	Who cares!|`|c07v7O80aa	First, you own nothing, child. Your parents do. And the school is acting as a parent during the school day and has a lot of the same authority as your parents.|`|7Z09mZt3aa	Sadly, it's their turf, their rules.|`|z88IMXNFaa	Nope.  Teachers can confiscate virtually anything they like.|`|8cf795959f4bb56d8c730f6fc0d177dfaa	Yes they can, if the object violates school policy, creates a safety hazard, allows for academic dishonesty, or creates a distraction.  I can think of two examples off the top of my head.    Most schools do not allow the use of cell phones during the academic day.  A student's cell phone can be taken away if they are in violation of this policy.    Almost every school bans firearms from the premises (for obvious reasons).  A firearm will be taken away from a student who possesses one.    EDIT    The criminal code of Canada does not apply to schools in the United States and our Supreme Court has affirmed everything I have said as legal.

C7N3BNGbaa	how do u get arrested by a citizen????|`|8ivnzNi5aa	1.  In theory, yes.  2.  It depends on what damages you can prove, and what the laws of your home state, or the state in which the incident occurred, allow.    Ask a lawyer for more details.|`|AA10047588	In this country you can sue anyone for anything.  There was that dumb judge in DC who sued a dry cleaner for over $50 million.

When are you brain dead liberals going to come out of your coma and realize Obama passing out $10 bills in front of the White House would do more for the economy than this piece of crap? Have you even read this bunch of garbage? 50 million for the National Endowment for the Arts, 300 million for grants to combat violence against women, 6 billion for university building projects, 4.2 billion Neighborhood stabilization activities, 650 million Digital TV coupons, 150 million for the Smithsonian, 34 million to renovate the Dept. of Commerce headquarters, 500 million for improvement projects fot the National Institute for Health facilities, 44 million for repairs to the Dept. of Agricultures headquarters, 350 million Agriculture Dept computers, 88 million to help move the Public Health Service into a new building, 600 million to convert federal auto fleets to hybrids, 1 billion for the Census Bureau, 850 million AMTRAK ( when will they ever make a profit? ), 87 million for a polar ice breaking ship, 1.7 million National Park System, 55 million for the Historic Preservation Fund, 7.6 billion Rule community advancement program, 160 million for paid volunteers at the Corporation for National Community Service. Now Ill grant you some of these programs are worth funding, but that is what the budget is for. Most of it how ever is pure pork. The only thing it will stimulate is my taste buds I love ham!|`|fbf036d0bcf69547cc9d92e1f54de8d8aa	It's all just a bunch of bull crap.

But I know I was ticked off when you had those banks not telling the govt where the money was used during the first round of our money went to them.

Conclusion: there is no such thing as an "unconcealed" weapon.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Yes,it's still a concealed weapon and the cops will pull you over every time they see you.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	No, but you should tell a cop and make it clear that it is no longer concealed.

RE7AvblUaa	When purchasing Louisiana from France, Pres. Thomas Jefferson violated the Tenth Amendment in the Bills of Rights.    Opponents accused Jefferson of "tearing the Constitution to tatters" They said that the Constitution made no provision for purchasing foreign country.|`|091ca1bd7e49158f5110601cac84ad3baa	Not 100% sure about this one but perhaps the President does not have the power to just spend money like that with out the approval of Congress?    A strict constructionist, Jefferson also believed that a U.S. president did not have the authority to engage in such a deal because it was not specified in the constitution, and that to do so would moreover erode states' rights by increasing federal executive power.|`|pMrSfaz2aa	He really didn't violate the constitution due to the Elastic Clause in the constitution which allows things to happen which aren't stated in the constitution as long as they are "necessary and proper" could you imagine if America was only limited to the 13 colonies? It would be hell. So in this case i think it was necessary and proper.

AA10265786	I would give him a 10. I believe George W. Bush is the Greatest President in the history of the United States of America and I am glad that I voted for him twice in 2000 and 2004. If his brother John Ellis Bush (or Jeb Bush) ever runs for President, not only will I vote for him, but I will do everything I can to make sure he becomes President of the United States of America.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I'd say a 6.|`|TKbYavhzaa	I'd give him a 3.  Really, I'd like to give him a 1, but I think he was trying to do a good job.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	There is no scale low enough to quantify his failures.|`|w38AedkFaa	Bush had the most difficult issues put on him than anyone other president, granted he made mistakes but all in all I believe he did a good job except the last 2 years.

Well history will judge that in the end.I do believe he did his best as he knew how.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	i would give him a 6|`|trMsK86jaa	I'll give him a 4 for cunning.    edit; 1 point for being pres, 3 points for being ruthless.|`|2jSW9Asfaa	LOL    3    not the worst ever but pretty close|`|b32jC7pGaa	Having Bush for president was like the country having syphillis.

He was average, even excellent on foreign affairs.  He was not a good conservative on the domestic front.  Obama will fail on both fronts.  He is weak in the eyes of the terrorists, and he will be worse than Bush domestically and on the economy.|`|zBm2CWljaa	I would probably give him a 7 or 8. He kept this country safe, went after the bad guys, and really just stuck to his guns. I deeply respect that. I respect that he didn't let the unfair criticism of the media and others get to him and always did what he thought was right. I think that in the future, the history books will have President Bush written down as one of the best presidents of modern history. Those who write the history books will not be blinded by the prejudice that now emanates from the media and will be able to fairly judge Bush's presidency.|`|EOhxXxM9aa	1 because the PDB of 8/6/2001 proves he ignored terrorism and national security until 911.    If anything he is a -7.|`|GkqTIGVqaa	Everyone should stop blaming him, 7|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	He ranks below 1.    Way below.      Results don't lie.

He may not have made the best decisions (especially here on the home front), but he was in no way the worst president we have ever had. I think he at least cared a lot about this country. He did what he thought was right, as every president does. Whether he was good or not, I think only history will tell.    I give him an 8|`|3NKOVaNhaa	I give him a 6|`|4MxCAm6gaa	I think that he was the un-doing of america. If he would have been in office for the first year only, we may not be in such bad shape. I give him a .02|`|NZiswBq8aa	in the future he will be looked at as a great president. I know he will, everybody hated all the greats of our times. Shoot everyone hated lincoln look at the guy now he's one of the most respected presidents now. I give him a 9 because he got 60% of what he set out to do in his campaign completed and he did what he felt was right. Some people may not think those choices were the best, and I'll agree some were off but he did what was necessary. And everyone now is blaming him for this economy collapse and no it wasn't him, he helped improve the economy. The collapse is because of dumb irresponsible people with credit cards and sub prime mortgages people couldn't pay. He even tried stopping the reinstatement act law but congress didn't pass it in 2005.|`|1fFn1UhEaa	I'd give him a definite 0.      He screwed this country up from day one.  Including a war based on the only fact that he wanted revenge for someone threatening his father.    We went in their because of WMD's,  then it was turned into about terrorism.  They have already proven there were zero WMD's in the country and also that Iraq has never been linked to the terrorism threatening the USA.  Not until we invaded their country.      He is no different than a modern day Hitler.|`|TPB7NjvIaa	By the time this administration is through he is going to look like a 10.|`|AA10841890	Since I worked on the JACADS project in the late 80s, I know that there are chemical weapons stockpiled in Iraq, and that Israel and Syria actually have the largest stockpiles of chem weapons in the world. So under Bush's watch did you hear of any Americans dying from chemical weapons (not counting Anthrax since that's a naturally occurring bacteria)? NO. you did NOT. Bush was / is not an extemporaneous speaker, that's a given. But then neither is NObama. The only time NObama speaks well is when he's MEMORIZED the words, otherwise he 'ummms and ahhhs' and looks left / right in a very unfocused way (make a note of that obama speechwriters). He is NOT a patriot, he is a PRETENDER to the throne. He's not the anti-Christ, he's not smart enough or beloved enough. So I give Bush an 6, but I think that HISTORY will give him a 10, when all the truth comes out. What will Obama end up with? probably a 2, unless someone stupidly makes him a martyr then he'll get a higher score just like Jack Kennedy did. THAT truth won't come out until 2050.|`|TBDiMZcTaa	7 was never given a fair chance by the media.|`|oO70m5Rtaa	He kept us safe for 7 years. Ugh, ignore whatever happened that 1st year.

wVik8Fo7aa	Yes, it is quite a relief.  Not only will alternative energy prevent more of an environmental disaster, but it will keep our country safer.

I think the private market should handle it.    Did you know that the model T was designed to run on hemp oil, because Ford liked the farmers and wanted to help them out in the recession?  And did you know that the oil companies pushed for and got the initial subsidies so the new hemp ethanol industry couldn't get off the ground because it couldn't compete?    whenever government acts there are unintended consequences.  Government should stay out of the market except to police it for fraud and to enforce contracts.|`|CgGVpUI5aa	No, because I am the one paying the energy bills.  Alternative energy is five times more expensive on average.  Nuclear plants are the way to both cheaper energy and reduced carbon emissions.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	You are a kid...it doesn't matter!|`|P8gGMlbIaa	We still need all forms of energy, not just alternate energy. Oil will always be in demand, we don't just get fuel from oil. Plastics, asphalt, paraffin wax and tar all come from oil. Our entire modern world and life style depends on oil.    We need all kinds of forms of energy, to try and stop any of what we have now is just a show of ignorance.    Yes, we should build wind generators. But we should still drill more and drill now. Other wise no one will be able to afford to live and the current standard of living we now enjoy. That would mean no more internet for you.

And with him being in the military you can go far or to nice places like cancun or something. My husband and I just stayed at a hotel for 3 days in a city about 30 minutes from us. We spent quality time together. And on one night we had our close friends come and party with us and we had pizza. It' was a fun time. It wasn't anything too special, but you can save up your money for a nicer honeymoon down the road. My husband and I are renewing our vows and having a real wedding on our anniversary this year. He will be home from Iraq and he's going to take leave so he's actually able to go somewhere.  With your fiance being on recruiting duty, I can guarantee he wont have much time to go anywhere far. My husband did the exact thing. The hotel we were in was right by the recruiting station. So I dropped him off Monday before he had to report for duty. I would say just go to a nice town and spend some quality time together. That's all that will really matter because he will be leaving again soon.

Then I would say it wouldn't be a good idea. But if you aren't and not doing so well, then i would say to join. Joining means you get paid to go to training camps, to obviously guard/rescue, and you get a paid scholarship to a college.  Unless your passion is to do stuff like that, don't do it just because you want to. Do it for a reason. I guess the most obvious is probably money for college or passion. Other than that I wouldn't recommend it.  I hope this helps! Good Luck with your choice!|`|NBBRWd5Gaa	if the uniform looks good then do it!! :D|`|23rM9AeWaa	yepyep... :)

Me speaking english(and being white american native) was able to learn things from my boss and I worked really hard at educating myself.  I moved up really fast.  I am only 19 years old and I boss 30 year old beaners around the shop.  When things got slow my boss needed to keep me around to keep things running because obviously none of the illegals are even allowed to operate these machines.  He laid off all of the illegals and kept all the educated english speaking workers.  Funniest **** ever!  Employers will generally keep the most valuable employees around but i guess their are other situations where they just keep the cheap ones.|`|m6PnfBvOaa	Well illegal immigrants are far cheaper for domestic stuff, but there is another reason that is far more important and that is the aliens still have something that a lot American workers don't - the work ethic.  This may be defined as giving a days worth of work for a day's pay.|`|EWwTlokmaa	Here we go again! What do you mean, "why are we still giving money 2 foreign people"?

9PoGLVmXaa	We're used to punishments being uniform, but before this period the king could do anything he wanted and even in America there had been dunking, use of public stocks, burning at the stake and other forms of punishment. This Amendment gave the courts the legal grounds to declare these unconstitutional and put punishments under federal jurisdiction. This resulted in more or less universal uniformity in America. The courts have gone a little too far in basically saying a convict can suffer no pain what so ever in my opinion.|`|gaXUIduMaa	In a nutshell it is saying that the punishment should fit the crime and limits what kind of punishment can be imposed.  Some of this was in direct response to some of the things the English monarchy and other countries did.  There people used to be thrown in prison, tortured,  and property taken away for no or little reason.   During the Revolutionary war, American sailors were taken off ships and forced into service or even imprisoned while on the high seas.    Although most people concentrate on the last part, even the first part is important.  It first says that you cannot be thrown in jail for an excessive amount of time or fined say a million dollars  for something like jaywalking.   The second part is the part that eliminates torture and other harsh treatments.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	have you read it? why do you think its important.

Don't get me wrong, I don't just think he should because I hate him, it's because he desrves to be. He increased the power of the president greatly so he could do all this crap he was doing legally.

Besides, George W. Bush is a Champion and Champions like Bush Always Win because they Play By The Rules. I believe as a Fact that if Former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Winston Churchill, Former President of the United States of America George Washington and Former Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada Pierre Trudeau were all alive today, all three men would be very proud of the of the hard work that Bush did in order to make the world a better place and I believe that in 20 years from now, Americans are going to say Bush was a great leader who made both America and the World a Better Place.|`|LMgUpEgjaa	Yes, and a few other crimes as well.

Would you prefer that you never feel safe whenever you go outside your own home? Oh sure Americans who live in slums already feel unsafe all the time, but no one, not a SINGLE person with normal intelligence needs to be poor, not in this country. I proved that myself by living/working on my own since 13 years of age. Refugees who come here from Asia prove that by how they take advantage of the opportunities available to people who are willing to work and focus on a goal until it is achieved.  As for 'illegal wiretaps'... the govt has been doing THAT for decades because you cannot trust ANY govt. Go look up 611 Folsom, Floor six in San Francisco. AT&T's building, where they have been spying on YOUR phone calls for more than a decade. You know when it started? Under the CLINTSLIME's watch. That's right! This country has a constitution based on NATURAL law but since the 30s police, lawyers, govt. people have been VIOLATING the laws, and getting away with it, because even the Supreme Court backs them up.  Do your homework!!! KNOW what is TRUTH and what is LIES. When does this lawbreaking occur? Under the DEMOCRATS for the most part but the Republicans get away with it too. That's why those two Border Guards didn't get a FULL PARDON by Bush (I didn't like that ahole either but he did keep the USA safe, and NObama the stupid, big-eared, blackmouthed puppet will NOT, EVER, keep us safe. Don't you hear the turd-world jackals approaching?
aroVKyA6aa	So far, there are no stimulus checks but that does nto mean the government or I should say the president will not order one later in the year.  If you recall, that was what Bush did.  So even if you file your taxes and get your refund or pay tazxes and such an order is issued, it will be mailed to you automatically.  As to how much it will be I would only imagine that it would be based on the same criteria which was set for last year.|`|AA11600810	Who cares, it is just your money, loaned to you and you get to pay it back with interest.

In the Seventies, the Obama family became friendly with Frank Marshall Davis (1905-1987), a black writer and fellow Hawaiian resident. Davis wrote for the Honolulu Record (a Communist newspaper) and was a known member of the Soviet-controlled Communist Party USA (CPUSA). He soon became the young Barack Obama's mentor and advisor.    In Dreams From My Father, Obama writes about Davis but does not reveal the latter's full name, identifying him only as "a poet named Frank" -- a man with much "hard-earned knowledge" who had known "some modest notoriety once" but was now "pushing eighty." (Several sources -- including Professor Gerald Horne, Dr. Kathryn Takara, and libertarian writer Trevor Loudon -- have confirmed that Obama's "Frank" was indeed Frank Marshall Davis.)    http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/indiv...|`|1amF7oNwaa	WHAT POSITIVE IMPACT?
AA12098193	There is no specific statute that says what human right are in the USA. It is therefore a matter of international law and the USA adhering to international statutes such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  In the US it is a matter of custom to say that the Civil Rights Act talks about Human Rights, though it does not actually say so. If that where the case then the right to bear arms would be the most astounding civil right that no one else recognizes as a human right.    Nevertheless, it is also important to notice the following:  The right to life is considered a human right in most countries, which implies that the death penalty is a human rights violation still legal in the USA.  Most countries have specific provisions to ban torture.  Torture was prohibited in the USA under Title 18 of the U.S.C.  2340, though in a very limited way because its definition limited torture to acts that cause permanent bodily damage done within the "maritime and territorial jurisdiction" of the USA. But the "Military Commissions Act" passed in 2006 actually legalizes torture as a means to combat terrorism.

JdYVmsNaaa	I have to admit, there an enjoyable level of hypocrisy in criticizing the President, while soapboxing about respect for the Office.     My first thought was the story of Thomas Jefferson, who answered his own door in the Whitehouse, and once offended some dignitary or other by answering in his bathrobe and slippers. :-)     I can imagine the papers had a good time with that, but it's now only a humorous footnote in a magnificent legacy. I hope the same for President Obama.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	They are all figureheads but I would have wished we had someone strong, not someone running like a chicken with its head cut off.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Yes, that's why we didn't elect McCain.|`|2jSW9Asfaa	yes|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	I don't care what Obama wears, although I would prefer he didn't dress like a Baptist minister.   That might be because I used to wear a caftan, or a bur-nous, or a sarong, when shopping on hot days in very conservative Adelaide, South Australia, years ago.  We had a Premier who wore pink shorts.  That set the cats amongst the pigeons.   What fun.   What matters is that people have intelligence, imagination, and capability - and can pay their accounts.   Especially if they have power.    Figureheads can look grand, but a ship still needs a navigator and a capable skipper.

Which one sounds better? Some fat, doughnut eating slob who doesn't take care of his body will use all our money so that when we need it it will not be there to save us. Health savings plans are a great idea. Obama wants to take wealth from Americans and redistribute it, one way or the other!! God help us... and thank God my faith is not in Mr. Obama!|`|8OaAmwq8aa	Probably.  I think However permanent injuries you would still be liable for.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Probably yes.  It may not make it cheaper, but it would definitely slow the rising costs.    Rising costs of medical care is related to the huge sums of lossses suffered by the companies that provide health care, when Americans fiel bankruptcy after being unable to pay their bills.    The calculate the costs of providing that service, and if they suffered losses, they must increase the price to compensate on you, I, and our insurance companies.  Insurance companies then do the same thing on you and I.    If you prevent the losses, then you hopefullly prevent the problem.    But then of course, the health care compnaies might just look at it as extra profit and keep raising prices anyway. So its a thing that would have to be tried to see if it will work as planned.|`|1e9d3b83ee4eab612b90db60f5cea95daa	In theory yes, because now the healthcare costs would be covered by the state, and not the insurance companies.    If the insurance company no longer runs the risk of having to dole out hundreds of thousands of dollars in medical bills and the very real possibility of paying out even more for a lawsuit - one of my friends tapped a guy at 10mph, and a year later, her insurance got sued for $250k for his horrendous emotional, physical, and psychological distress.  They ultimately settled for $30k, because they didn't want to risk losing more in court.    If insurance companies didn't have to shell out hundreds of thousands in healthcare costs, then your monthly premium would, theoretically, go down as a result.  However, I doubt they would lower it voluntarily; we're used to paying $50-350/mo for insurance, and so they'd still charge you that if they could get away with it.  Their profit margins would skyrocket.|`|AA10685337	Get an auto insurance quote here: http://dominatingonline.com/auto-insuran...
D1LD08fraa	Hey, I'm the Lieutenant for the Monroe Police Dept. Explorer Post in Monroe, NC. We help our Dept during community events and parades. You usually help with crowd control or directing traffic, its a great experience especially if you want to get into the law enforcement field. I could sit here and write the LOAD of things we get to do but instead i'll give you a link to our website and you can check it out there. We also have a ride along program but our explorers have to be maintain good behavior, be a member for at least 6 months, and become certified. Our certification requires the general orientation of police cars, equipment, 10-codes, classes on report writing, and more. Once you ride along you can assist the officer on calls that arent a high risk for you. Its a great experience to go on a ride along. Most officers dont mind, the shift Sergeants will ask if anyone will volunteer to take an explorer and there is always a few that raise their hand, plus they rather have an explorer ride with them who has a general idea of what is happening than some stranger or civilian (our dept has many civilians or reporters that want to ride along). We are limited to one ride along every 2 weeks. Now everything I mentioned above is based on our Dept.'s explorer guidelines, it can be different Dept to Dept. I would call your local Dept and find out more info, don't hesitate is an amazing program. (Oh we are part of the Boy Scouts but don't do anything with them, our uniforms are provided by the PD not the Boy Scouts, as a matter infact the only time we hear from the boy scouts is when they want to collect our monthly post fees haha) and its nothing like ROTC you actually get to piantball and work with firearms (some posts) plus get aqquainted with the SWAT equipment and weapons|`|TtI7VtTfaa	They brown nose the cops.

Every human being does have a right to the "unalienable rights" mentioned in the quote following the question above, and I am most positive that the existence of such an institution would automatically infringe upon these declared rights. As to the purpose of government, I would have to say that government was created to control people and thus society. In order to control society and the people within it, the commanding institution, labeled a "government," would be forced to control the cravings of the people. Wherein comes the use of taxes, health care and other insurances, and public services. By control the people's craving they control the people. Give a poor man money, and he will follow you anywhere. Give a lonely human a companion, and he will praise your name. That, I believe, is the true purpose of governing bodies: to exercise control over the cravings of its citizens.

7d2d6d4d7776168256be9f967571c2caaa	Eugenics was an international scientific, political and moral ideology and movement which was at its height in first half of the twentieth century and was largely abandoned with the end of WWII.[2] The movement often pursued pseudoscientific notions of racial supremacy and purity.[3]    Its advocates regarded it as a social philosophy for the improvement of human hereditary traits through the promotion of higher reproduction of certain people and traits, and the reduction of reproduction of certain people and traits.[4] Today it is widely regarded as a brutal movement which inflicted massive human rights violations on millions of people.[5] The movement, led by race scientists, financed by private philanthropies such as the Carnegie Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation and implemented by governments was practised in North America, Europe (particularly Nazi Germany), and Australia (among others).[citation needed] The "interventions" advocated and practised by eugenicists involved prominently the identification and classification of individuals and their families (including the poor, mentally ill, blind, 'promiscuous women', homosexuals) and entire "racial" groups (such as the Roma and Jews) as "degenerate" or "unfit", the segregation or institutionalisation of such individuals and groups, their sterilization, their "euthanasia", and in the worst case of Nazi Germany, their mass extermination.[6] The practices engaged in by eugenicists involving violations of privacy, attacks on reputation, violations of the right to life, to found a family, to discrimination are all today classified as violations of human rights. The practice of negative racial aspects of eugenics, after World War II, fell within the definition of the new international crime of genocide, set out in the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.[7]    The modern field and term were first formulated by Sir Francis Galton in 1883,[8] drawing on the recent work of his cousin Charles Darwin. From its inception eugenics was supported by prominent people, including H. G. Wells, Woodrow Wilson, Theodore Roosevelt, Emile Zola, George Bernard Shaw, John Maynard Keynes, William Keith Kellogg, Margaret Sanger, Winston Churchill, and Sidney Webb.[9][10][11] Its most infamous proponent and practitioner was however Adolf Hitler who praised and incorporated Eugenic ideas in Mein Kampf, and emulated Eugenic legislation for the sterilization of "defectives" that had been pioneered in the United States.[12] G. K. Chesterton was an early critic of the philosophy of eugenics, expressing this opinion in his book, Eugenics and Other Evils. Eugenics became an academic discipline at many colleges and universities, and received funding from many sources.[13] Three International Eugenics Conferences presented a global venue for eugenicists with meetings in 1912 in London, and in 1921 and 1932 in New York. Eugenic policies were first implemented in the early 1900s in the United States.[14] Later, in the 1920s and 30s, the eugenic policy of sterilizing certain mental patients was implemented in a variety of other countries, including Belgium,[15] Brazil,[16] Canada,[17] and Sweden,[18] among others. The scientific reputation of eugenics started to decline in the 1930s, a time when Ernst Rdin used eugenics as a justification for the racial policies of Nazi Germany, and when proponents of eugenics among scientists and thinkers prompted a backlash in the public. Nevertheless, the second largest known eugenics program, created by social democrats in Sweden, continued until 1975.[18]    Since the postwar period, both the public and the scientific communities have associated eugenics with Nazi abuses, such as enforced racial hygiene, human experimentation, and the extermination of undesired population groups. However, developments in genetic, genomic, and reproductive technologies at the end of the 20th century have raised many new questions and concerns about what exactly constitutes the meaning of eugenics and what its ethical and moral status is in the modern era.  ---------------    I don't support everything my party stands for.

Anyone different was always mistreated or enslaved or outright killed.  Until the last 200 years you rarely saw anyone with visible mental illness or severe physical disabilities, they were considered bad and killed or shunned.

SaxjkMbSaa	Amen......I investigated Medicaid & Medicare Fraud for over 25 years.  I saw millions of dollars in larceny by both the providers ( doctors ) & the recipients ( patients )  I saw one woman with 21 different Medicaid cards under 21 different names and 21 different ID  s all with her photo on them.  I arrested a Dentist who billed Medicaid for 18 months for $ 13,500 per day for ficticious dental work that he never performed. He had gypsy cabs drive 40 junkies per day to his office ( which was open for 2 hours a day ) and he paid each junkie ten dollars & x-rayed their mouth and billed Medicaid for $ 350 worth of work that he never performed for each patient.  I did an undercover at a Psychiatrist ( where I posed as a Medicare Patient ) where the Psychiatrist overbilled Medicare for over $ 750,000 by billing for 29 hours worth of psychotherapy every day and .....guess what ?  Medicare paid for it  I saw health & dental care that I wouldn't subject my dog to.  I once had an undercover visiting a Medicaid Dentist where the new dental technician complained to the dentist that she ( dentist ) was not sterilyzing the instuments she used on differnet patients.

jWcVcXZQaa	Funny how Republican resistance to US Automaker bailout goes back to having 'Foreign' automakers plants in their States.  Here is an interesting fact...If it is these "High Cost" union jobs that hurt US automakers, how do the republicans explain nummi.  Same union workers at the same plant make GM and Toyota cars.  What is the difference...Maybe the Top management at the two companies!!!|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	you must be a liberal|`|3eGKlXVbaa	Nafta > Clinton signed it.  Go Green and get fuel economic autos> Democrats  World peace and full cooperation and assistance from Government> Democrats    Get US people employed without being controlled by American Union in a factory that will survive> Republicans|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	Again...how does encouraging more personal spending help the current economy?  And do you not realize about 80% of those "replacement" cars would have been Toyotas and Hondas?     Finally, Tom Harkin is from Iowa.....hmmmmm....what do they grow in Iowa?  Could it be CORN!  The very same corn that the government is paying farmers to grow for ethanol production ... a government program that has been driving up food prices for months now?    Funny how the author failed to put as much emphasis on that as on the demographics of the "Republican" states...|`|6eoMqJF0aa	So because the non union automakers here in the states that employ millions of Americans make more fuel efficient cars they should be punished.|`|bA0sLHnlaa	Im a social liberal but to be honest, if the american car companies can't compete on the global market, they why should we prop them up to reward their inefficiency?   Yes we can blame the unions and they play a huge part in this, but there are plenty of cars made in the US by non union workers.   The are all foreign owned but the wages earned by the workers are right in here in US.    I think its time to clean house.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Yep, Republicans are happy to spend billions of dollars subsidizing foreign owned companies in their states but won't even spring for a loan to American owned companies.|`|RuUUPWYUaa	Just another string of instances in which the Republican Party has failed the American people in any demographic one could image; with the exception of the wealthy and growing elitist. By the way; their children if ever; seldom fight on the front lines for our liberties.
9PAavWnyaa	Six hours after the crash and the determination that everyone had survived, the story should have been history. What else is there to say?   Yeah, I've had more than my fill of this event and the people involved.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I agree, if any of us were in that situation, we'd be trying to save our own lives. A hero risks their life to save others but doesn't have to.     I hate these sensationalist media types that are trying to make a story out of nothing.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	Heroism or not, it is refreshing to see proof that there are still some people around who keep their heads in a dire emergency and use their training to do the right thing. It is due to the widespread lack of such people that we are in the mess we are today.   I'd be content to see the hype die down; but nothing would please me more than to hear the expression "Doing a Sully" standing for an act of exemplary professionalism under pressure.|`|PaLJ4pU8aa	As we are forced to watch the incompetent messiah day after day, having a competent person such as Sully in the news is comforting.|`|4pN1Zmaeaa	Nope, not tired yet.  If you don't want to hear it, quit listening.  It will be old news and out of the cycle before you know it.    Skillful, yes, and damn lucky.  Regardless, I'm still pretty impressed.    fs|`|GFdppnFHaa	Yes.  He did a great job but the media are running this thing in the ground.  If that landing had turned out badly, they would have been talking about his drinking problems and how his father mistreated him blah blah blah,|`|9FHoZOTGaa	No...     I would way rather listen to a story over and over about that landing then be exposed to listening to our dip sh*t of a new President or any of the new ways he's going to f*ck up the Country even more! :)|`|bc03bfe3197d24248084be9b6a4c7dfcaa	he had a library book in the hold "Professional Ethics" Congress, the Senate and ALL cabinet nominees need to read this book, including our illustrious leader from CHICAGO. What was 52%of america thinking?|`|KhBmlaefaa	I agree. I'm tired of hearing about that and Miley Cyrus slant eyed photo. I bet even Sully is pretty darn tired of it too. He seems like he really just wants to be left alone.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	Yes. There were 1,300 dead people in Gaza at that time, and all I heard about on TV was an incident where a few geese died. Some value we place on human life...|`|7mOfekBWaa	It's one of those stories that got lucky on a slow news day. The media always jumps onto one of these stories and plays it for all its worth.  Same thing happened to Laci Peterson, Anna Nicole Smith, callie anthony, etc. Give it time and it'll pass.|`|nTzTIrataa	No, I am not tired of hearing about it at all.    There have been very, very few successful landings of airliners on water, and he deserves as much attention as the media seems fit to give him.    In fact, the more I read about the story, the more impressed I am with the guy.  They just released the transcript of the conversations he was having with the flight controllers as the plane was going down, and he is one cool-headed guy.    Here's the text version:    http://www.scribd.com/doc/11719666/Traco...|`|0eFSeap5aa	What he did was phenomenal.  This wasn't just a matter of doing what he was paid to do, he saved a lot of lives.   I'd like to hear more about people doing things like that and less of the usual fare in the news involving bankrupting economies and the politicians who make them that way.|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	No, actually, I'm not tired of hearing about it.    We're so inundated with bad news in this day and age, and constantly barraged with stories about greedy CEO's, and crooked politicians...for once...it's so nice to hear a positive story.  Every once in a while we need someone that we can call a hero, and not look to try to find a way to bring the person down.    Yes, it was his job to bring the plane down safely, but he still did an amazing job, and hundreds of people went home to their families that night who under any other circumstances would have been dead.  With someone less experienced or calm behind the helm, if the plane had been tilted even inches to the side causing the wing to clip the water first, and it would have been disasterous.  Let people enjoy having someone to cheer for a while.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes, I have been.|`|RLTQrmnMaa	I am tickled pink that he landed that plane safely and everybody got out alive. Yep, I'm sick of hearing about it.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Well yes/no.  I know what he did, you don't know how hard it is to do what he did.  Amazing stuff...  But the story can get boring to those who are not into aviation.    This country could use some hero's, and this guy is a true hero.|`|FyszvGyWaa	Today I really enjoyed listening to his communications right before "landing."  He was so calm and cool, it was pretty awesome, and I enjoyed it.  I also liked that the guy in the tower was rather calm until the end, and then I could hear his voice shaking.

l4WEwTWwaa	I'm actually a Marine but I can answer this question easily. In the Navy a con may be that you spend 6 to 7 months out of the year at sea. The living conditions aren't bad but they aren't a five star hotel either. Pros are just simply you are defending and representing your country. The nice solid white uniform is pretty nice too.|`|LUosDsYaaa	The Air force has very nice bases, and they treat each other with respect.    Depending on where you go in the Navy, it can be the most advanced high tech equipment found anywhere.    1. High tech equipment with high tech training.    Navy bases really suck, All the navy wants at a base is piers and warehouses. So do not go in the Navy looking for pretty bases. Or even for nice housing. the Navy prefers to pay it's sailors to go out and to find their own housing.        2. Which leads to the Navy's best 'pro', the pay.    The Navy pays more more than any other service.     The Navy's SRB is the highest.    Every time you Re-Enlist they are offering a cap of $90k in front of you. [it changes depending on what your rate / NEC is. If your job is hard and requires a lot of schooling, then your SRB is higher].    The Navy routinely sees tax-free service. It is common to serve for decades where your salary is completely tax-free. I was tax-free from 1983 until I retired in 2001. The Army, AF, Marines will only see tax-free status while they are being shot at.    While most solders, marines and airmen are being paid 'base pay'; sailors routinely will bring home three to four times more.    In my case, base pay was commonly 1/4 of my take home paycheck.    If you want money to party with; if you want money to invest with; if you want money for college; then go for the highest pay.    Their will be folks who will lie to you, they will say that all military gets paid the same. Just ask any navy recruiter how much the current SRB level is for a ET1 Nuclear Reactor Operator, buckle your seat belt, as it will take a few minutes for him to look it up, but then $90k will be his answer.    I was not a nuc, but I got $65k every 4 years when I re-upped.    Also when you look at the paycharts, keep in mind that the Navy commonly pays sailors bunches of the extra pays and allowances.    During most of my career, I got:  BAQ,  BAS,  COLA, VHA,  Sub pay,  Career sub pay,  Sea pay,  Career sea pay,  Sea pay kicker,  Female separation pay,    All in addition to base pay.      3. You can attend college courses while you are at sea, and the Navy will pay 80% of the tuition.        4. Also the Navy provides CLEP tests for free, every week you can read any textbook you want, and then take a CLEP test for that topic. If you pass that CLEP test, then you get college credit for having completed that course. I did a bunch of CLEPs, and I took a few courses. I was able to complete: an A.S., a B.S. and a M.A. degree, all while I was in the Navy.        5. Unless you wish to be shot at, you can serve your country without being shot at. And you can earn a pension. After 20 years of service you get a pension.    With my investing and my pension, I now support my family, while I go fishing. I bought a retirement home in a forest. My children are finishing high school, and I am free to go fishing everyday.    Most military retirees are broke, and their pensions are not enough to support a growing family. Not without a large investment portfolio.    But after having spent a 20 year career with heavy investing, I can support my family, with my retirement income.        By the way, I am a career submariner.    ET is a good rate. As are QM, RM, FT, TM, MM, IC, MT, and even HM [if you go IDC]|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	I served 22 years in the Navy.  All my schools (about 2 years) were on Air Force bases and my classes were mixed Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps.    In the Navy you can expect to travel.  Period.  In the Navy you deploy, war or no war.  Living conditions on a ship are miserable.  Air Force barracks and chow halls are like a Holiday Inn.    The Air Force was much more anal about everything.  The Navy, especially on sea duty, is much less formal.    At sea, in the Navy, you'll work 100 hours a week.  In the Air Force it seemed like most people had much more conventional hours.    Air Force family housing was very nice. Navy family housing was much older, smaller and not near as nice.    My opinion is that the Air Force is better in every way, but two..... 1. Travel.  I visited 44 countries in 22 years.  I was stationed in the USA, Spain, Italy, Japan and the Philippines.  2. Advancement.  The Navy has much faster advancement.|`|WHN5cuGZaa	Pro:  None  Cons:  say good bye to everything to go fight people who just want to be left alone  GG|`|trMsK86jaa	Pro: You do infact rise through the ranks remarkably fast.    Con: If you don't perform exceptionally, you'll be swabbing decks the rest of your career.|`|zftm6qkKaa	Pro: The navy offers the best chance of learning a trade but there is no guarantee that will happen.    Con about the Navy: your base moves out from under you. Air Force is better in that regard.|`|hbHUv05Xaa	I'm stationed Continental US shore duty and I have it made. Don't expect to get lucky like me though, I got a lot of buddies on sea duty and its not all roses and buttercups, you do get tax free sea pay though and for the most part it is relatively more safe than the Chair Force|`|DOcjGDVQaa	Im thinking about the armed forces to and here are pros and cons i've come up with about the Navy:    Pros: Get to work on an awesome piece of machinery, get to be out on the open water and use high speed boats, can see the world.  learn a trade, use some highly advanced weaponry.very good if into surfing and water sports!    Cons: if a submariner, working in a confined environment,   watch the movie Das Boot. or u571. scary stuff. At sea a lot. not good if get homesick easily.    I think if you can't decide between Navy and Airforce, chose to Navy because dont forget you can work on the helicopters and planes on ships. Then you get boats and planes!
4cfee734accabf2cf33df95b41ee32d5aa	I'm partial to the Air Force.  I think one of the biggest cons to the Navy is that you will most likely have a good chance of going to sea for six months at a time.  This may be something you would enjoy, but personally it is not something I would be at all interested in.  As far as jobs and training go, I think you can get close to the same level of quality in either service.|`|wHsbUeCKaa	Pro's: Exciting, one of the less dangerous military branches, interesting jobs.    Con's: Possibility of waging an unjust war, military budget in the US sucks way too much money out of things like education and public services. More work is needed in resolving foreign conflicts peacefully-- the US military is already an unstoppable juggernaught in the face of most potential threats.

Then they turned to sports and picked THEIR team as the only one worth a damn. Finally they turned to politics and picked THEIR party as the only one with any sense.

There are no democrats or republicans. There is only freedom and tyranny. It is us against them. Wake up sheeple. None of them are your friends.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I'll take it one step farther.  "We the People" elected them.  Politicians are only in office because we voted them in.    I see politicians as individual people doing the job they were elected to do (or not).    Some have more contacts than others.  Still, the industrial world does not vote them into office.  We do.    Most people are patriotic.  I believe that most Americans want what's best for the country.  They simply have different ideas about what's best.    There are areas of my life that constantly change regardless of who's in office.  Changes in taxes, changes in laws and freedoms.    As a rule, the national debt keeps getting bigger with every administration.  People who don't want to work won't work--unless laws are passed to force them to be responsible for themselves.  This happened with Reagan when he cut funding to social programs.  Wars start and end with every administration.  Sometimes I agree with the reasoning, sometimes I don't.    When the other party is in power, they do tend to give more funding for the "bums" and that lessens the need for them to want to change.    Politicians are "us" whether we like it or not.  We voted them in.  They are diverse but so are the people in our nation.|`|89YkHxMUaa	I blame both parties and its the truth.    Our government has become so corrupt.
XK1rmR0Gaa	Although I think that this is a trolling question, I will answer it anyway. I am a long time republican. I assume you are asking this question because of the fact that no republican voted to pass the stimulis bill in the house of representatives. The fact of the matter is that bill, despite Obama (allegidly) trying to make it a bi-partisan bill, failed to do so. In fact, the bill as it was introduced was nothing more than a democratic wish list and most of the spending is ( to a republican mind) not likely to induce any real economic recovery. It's not that any republican is pissed at Obama, it's just that we have deep idealogical differences. Republicans believe that the best way to stimulate the economy is to give businesses tax breaks and incentives to stimulate job growth. We also believe that the people are better off handeling thier own money rather than large government programs. This is the way government is supposed to work. The stimulus bill had no republican input as it sits. It was written by democrats and bullied it's way to the senate. Mr. Obama - to his credit-  already removed the part of the bill that would have dedicated millions of dollars to fund birth control. This is just one example of absurd things that are in the stimulis bill. Make no bones about it, this money is borrowed from our futures. If the money is wasted, we will all pay for it for a long time.    And by the way, those of you that are blaming Bush for the current economic conditions are missing some important points.   Economists agree that this WORLD economic crisis was partially caused by the SUB-PRIME loan falloout. Sub-Prime loans are the product of democratic ideas. The Republican  mantra on these loans are that if you can afford it, then go ahead, but if you fail, then you loose. If the banks that were offering these loans were allowed to fail - instead of being bailed out, perhaps we would be done with this now. Many prominant democrats spoke the praises of these types of loans. In fact, most economists agree that the real econmic crisis took off in October 2008 when the DEMOCRATS were in charge and Mr. Bush was a lame duck.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	He exists.

Then there would be no way to tell themselves that they are not idiots with no concern for anyone else and no common sense. No longer any excuses for their irrationality in defending Bush all these years while he has been driving the country into a ditch.      They do not need a reason.       BTW, I hate Nancy Pelosi as well.|`|Z5QL6THYaa	He is so much like that bonehead Republican President you-know-who, but he called himself a squeaky clean Democrat, and when he got elected, he spun out the cabinet consist of the characters from that bonehead Democrat President you-know-who.

BrjZhySIaa	LOL....seriously?  Hey, pssssst.... They already have ONE.  And they have so many convinced that they are two separate parties.  Ever heard of the Republicans and the Democrats?  Socialist liberals (Biden, Obama, Clinton(s), Dodd, etc) and the Neocons who have hijacked the Republican Party (Giuliani, McCain, Doug Feith, Dick Cheney, any other CFR member, etc) have teamed up through organizations like the Bilderberg Group, the Project for a New American Century, and the Council on Foreign Relations and are working to integrate America into the coming one world government.    They are doing this through the Central Banking systems as they work to break down some of the greatest economies in the world....ya, how's that going?    Clinton's own campaign adviser, Terry Mcauliffe, almost blurted out their 'secretive' plans on live TV... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPK3_uQbG...

Isn't that just exactly what has been going on for years? Isn't that what the UN and NAFTA, among other things, are all about? It seems to be a natural inevitability, in spite of the present global economic deflation. We can have a successful global economy only with a successful global government, obviously. Free trade facilitates success in economy while raising the standards of living, the common goal of free trade throughout the world, but it fails when speculators merely blow big bubbles in markets as corruption rots and money merely taxes true, productive economy.  Snap!  Crackle!  POP!    Besides, people have an inborn aversion to being homogenized, among other things.|`|e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	We have two parties already, the republicans and democrats. Well they don't formally say they support the NWO, but most of the members from both parties are big supporters of globalization, modeling this country after the European Union (i.e. the North American Union), expanding the UN's power and influence, and so on.    I think a one world government is possibly the worst idea ever next to Communism. And I'd love see all the posers in the democratic and republican parties leave and form their own NWO type party, and then we can see them for the snakes that they are and restore order and honor back to the parties they left.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	How do you prefer to be addressed?

It's always better for people to live with others who share the same values and beliefs. And to have a strong military to defend themselves.    An Indian in Mumbai is never going to want to pay the medical bills of an American in New York, and vice versa.    Most people love their culture (except for liberals), and they will defend it, so it's better if you try to set up your own culture rather than be passive-aggressive and try to change established cultures that you aren't willing to contribute to.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	Is this David Rockefeller or Henry Kissinger ?

There would have to to far too much government to control the world and big government is where trouble and graft comes from. This is one of the problems with the U.S. right now, the government has got too big and the politicians, the Federal Reserve Bank and big business has become so greedy and corrupt that they are stealing from the citizen.  This is why the Constitution was created with a small Federal government and the states having more control, but someplace along the line this changed and the Federal Government got a little bigger. After the Civil War it grew more, and then the Great Depression added to Federal strength and now the Federal Government is out of control and in turn the individual states are feeling it because of irrational laws implemented by the Federal Government.  No, it is not time for the New World Order, One Nation or even a Continental government. What we need is a smaller Federal Government that follows the laws of the Constitution to the letter.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	is your last name Rothschild?|`|G49lKR56aa	NO!|`|fDuCamMraa	No. But we could certainly use a Conservative Party around here.|`|a388e4e3066dcb4e1de9e18979b89ef0aa	YUP, we need to be able to see these people for who they are...they have been infiltrating the other 2 parties long enough....but I think the light of day will melt them|`|bBqPja7eaa	They say it's supposed to happen in the year 2012, and Obama will be the one to start it.

Not just in the United States, but in every other country where people will not quietly sit back and watch their liberties sold down the drain in the guise of 'peace and tranquility'.      Every time this has been attempted going back to the Roman, Greek and Persian empires, and more recently Hitler and Communist aggression, hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives.  The only way to have 'peace' among humans is to eliminate all those with opposing ideas, or who are not 'productive workers' who are forced to slave for the 'betterment of society'.

Obama is just the next step in the plan.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Yes, Bush did a lot of liberal things & now we have the first black President thanks to Bush & that then helped the GOP to make Micheal Steele their main man.

Vu7kCPesaa	Obama is creating trillions of dollars that don't exist, which further decreases the value of the dollar causing inflation. He's only making the problem worse. Also, throwing more money into companies that caused their own problems through bad business methods doesn't help. They need to be forced to deal with and correct their problems.    We should pull out of Iraq/Afghanistan, quit shitting on our own economy, and bring back the Constitution.|`|6nS62bB8aa	Back when NAFTA was being fought over, a lot of people said that jobs would be sucked out of America.

Someday (long after Obama leaves), the US Taxpayer has to pay "back" that trillion dollars which comes to be about $9500.00 for EACH US Taxpayer.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Whatever Obama does, the Republicans will whine and moan that it was the worst thing he could do.  Even if it was something they wanted.  Even if he reverses 180 degrees from what they didn't like, they still won't like it.    This is a deliberate Republican strategy, and they've done it for years.  They are the minority party in terms of voter registrations, and they always have been, even when they were in control.  The way a minority party gains control is through partisan bickering, putting party above country.  So anything Obama does they will blast it.  They can't cooperate with him on anything, even things they want themselves, for fear of handing him a victory.    President Clinton did a few 180 reversals in his time, giving up his own plan to do exactly what the Republicans wanted.  Every time the Republicans bashed him for doing exactly the wrong thing.  Remember NAFTA?  GHW Bush tried his whole term to get NAFTA passed, and Republicans complained loudly that Democrats were blocking it.  But when Clinton got it passed, the Republicans suddenly decided it was not a good idea at all.    The thing is, if Obama did do something bad, how would you know?  I mean you'd expect the Republicans who complain whether it was good or bad.  They're telling so many lies about him, how would you know when they were telling the truth?    Obama is certainly not perfect.  There are things he's done that I really liked and others I didn't.  But my view of his presidency is at least based on what I think is good or bad.  The Republicans' view is that anything done by a Democrat is wrong.  So how do they expect me to take them seriously?|`|13KBWzBXaa	I read your question and all the answers thus far. It's all the same old rah, rah, rah. My team is better than your team, our side is right, your side is wrong, Bush did this, Obama will do that.  People, the Dem's & the Rep's are two sides of the same authoritarian coin!  BOTH parties are out to get all they can from taxpayers for themselves and their pals, and neither side will help protect us from the government!    This is about economics. There are inviolate laws. Both sides ignore the facts and most of the sheeple are happily led by their favorite wing, to slaughter.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Yeah invest in America, because it is you young people that will be working for generations to pay it off.     Lucifer: Bush was required by law to back the defaulted mortgage notes with money for the FDIC, which guarantees FHA loans.    You see that little FDIC Insured sign on every bank.    Obama is spending to back big labor unions, trial lawyers, and expand the government with more federal employees.    Which will do very little for the economy, and the dirty little secret is, if the Obama stimulus package is so vital, then why not just pass it with democrat votes, and take full credit?    Obama does not need one single Republican vote to pass his package any time he wants.    But he wants a republican on board to share the blame.    And you do not even know what a liberal is.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	He's not investing in anything. Where do you get the idea that spending taxpayers money is investing.

Remember there are 3 other ones to follow this bill plus the debt that this administration was left with. Think of it this way it all has to be payed back and it took us over 200 years to get to 1 trillion when this admin took over now this administration wants to add another trillion to this? Plus we have 14 trillion in Guarantees, This is not something to take lightly.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	Jamie, Thank you, I have been saying that for two days. Try reading at least some of it before you make judgement. Well I did and had to stop at 100 pages. It was making me sick, I could not beleive what they want to fund. And what are we going to do about all the building projects? Just hire the Home Depot employees that got layed off? It takes skilled trades to build things, not the unemployed banker or street bum. At this point I no longer have any faith in this Government at all. My approval rating has finaly hit 0%. The only plus to this is the Younger generation will be left with the ruins. And there kids will never even have a chance at a good life. Since they wanted all this they can deal with it. I am thinking of not paying federal taxes for a while. No way am I paying for any of this.|`|5c7rgxA3aa	There's nothing wrong with that. I voted for him looking for change. The only problem I see is that for everything he does towards change...both republicans and democrats are attaching their own agendas to the package. If you look and do the research into the last voted stimulus package...the intention is to bring money to stimulate the economy. But if you look into the actual stimulus package itself to see what is actually getting the money...each is getting a handout that supports everything else OTHER than the economy. I only look at the republicans to bring the stupidity out of the package...and they did. If they didn't, then it would have flowed out to supposedly the economy, but to an art foundation, useless research projects, etc.     Confirm that you want this money to help our economy right? So...say for instance that your friend asked to borrow $1000 from you to pay off their credit card debt. You give him $2000 because you know he needs to take care of the debt and get his family off to a great start. But later, you find out that he used $1700 to go on a cruise vacation for him and his new girlfriend...and the other $300 went to his bills and other shopping items.     I want our new President Obama to setup oversight on the money being used and spent to make sure that money...all of it...is going towards stimulating our economy and not to some bogus grant. Doing that would help him and us move towards a successful country. It doesnt matter whether it's republican or democrat...it's doing the right thing for our country is what's important.    That's a really great question you have. Just go and do the research (without the TV news station to steer you)...and it's those individuals in congress we need to get rid of to become a success....cause they are making it worse for the goals of our President.
q8l339Gyaa	Well luckily this is nothing we need to worry about anymore. The only race companies like to see now is Mexican.

They are able to make different kinds of friends and they learn a lot about life through the hard work and competition. I do agree that some of the hoopla surrounding it though. I think it depends on the culture of the school. My school had decent athletics and fantastic academics but I loved every minute of the two varsity sports I played. However we have a sister school who does really well in athletics and they oddly have lower test scores and lower stats on everything academically than us. It does kind of show that something must be the problem because these are two high schools from the SAME district.. It's not like the kids attending are much different demographically. If you have the right kind of administration in the school and the right kind of coaches then school athletics can benefit everyone. It becomes a problem when coaches teach the mentality that sports are everything and the administration and teachers go too far to glamorize some of the athletes. I don't think the sports are the problem though. You just have to find the right kind of combination and when you do it can be a great experience.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	It depends on the school.  If a school does well, has good attendance and their students score highly on standardized tests, I see nothing wrong with having sports teams that are paid for with educational funds.    In my city, we have failed the standardized tests at least four years in a row (the worst in our region), our graduation rates are at 50%, attendance is poor and the schools are violent (two bomb scares in the last week).  Our school district is constantly telling us that they don't have enough money and raising our taxes.  In this case, I would like to see all sports dropped and that money spent on the basics.  Unless a school can do what they are actually there to do, no extras like sports.
BQdXnCcHaa	Don't underestimate the power of your vote (once you become of voting age). Like it or not, that power has caused a sea change in the direction of every US policy back in November.    It may not seem like we have power, and we forget that the state answers to us, not the other way around, because elections only come every couple of years (four for the White House) but that power is there. And everyone in Washington, in your state capital and even on your school board, knows it and fears it.    As they should.    Finally, good for you to be interested in the workings of your country!|`|A90SRsTxaa	We really do. We can't seem to get passed the problems in our own lives and partisan bickering long enough to realize it. I am not calling for violent revolution (just yet), but if you take 1% of gun owners you have a 1-1.5 million man army. The government knows this. They are scared of us. They are just not scared enough, because we haven't decided to stand as one unit against government control of every thing.|`|ZhZOckPPaa	The power is vested to the people BUT it is our responsibility to get informed do not believe the first thing you read investigate look at things as you have every right in the would after 18 years of age to do whatever you want as long as it does not infringe on another individuals rights (the same rights you have), also you have the right to believe anything you want as long as you do not impose those beliefs on another individual that has the same rights, remember we need to keep these rights that are given to us by our Creator (stated in the Declaration of Independence). And remember there is nowhere in the Declaration or constitution that gives anyone these rights except Americans. If You read these two documents you will see where the power lies and how it is slipping away.|`|6rwIm5Gnaa	No, people really dont have power. Man is fallible so our leaders can only create a fallible system. But leaders need an infallible system to lead. So people are the problem because people need to believe in a infallible system for the people to follow. So people have to be in a false reality that can be played on. Imagine if people through education were taught to think and believe that black is white. Then when you told them what they thought (black is white), you could turn their animal instincts on. Then, in a later time you could control them by telling them the truth....white is white and black is black....But these opposites gave you the ability to decide which opposite direction you want to lead them depending on the situation. Now you have a fallible system that the people call infallible when in reality its their illusion of the system of power.     Its not history that repeats itself, its man who repeats himself. People are being lead like blind sheep with no shepard. Real power comes from within, the power to love and God will spiritually open your eyes to all things that are taking place. The only real power is God, man is a sinner and enslaved to it. God will set you free....this is real power...to be able to see the truth while still being able to love everyone. Dont be suprised, all things come to pass.|`|Xk8AzsMmaa	not as it stands, but hopefully things will change...bills are being presented right now to take away your freedom, but now there are states trying to regain their sovereignty too...|`|4pN1Zmaeaa	Our government is so far from what was originally intended that it will take another revolution to change it.  That can only happen when the people become so fed up with things that we will, in mass, to change things.    fs|`|6nS62bB8aa	The internet is our new power. Sounds hokey, I know, but hear me out.    We get to vote every two years, on someone or something. In between we get to talk about what is going on every day. And we have access which previous generations could hardly dream of.    We get to sit at home each day or night and research what is really going on, and then "talk" about it here. We can get together and build consensus like no politician ever dreamed of. And send emails to the people we elected.    And then vote every two years.|`|lAjnRFSVaa	No we don't have any power we don't even have the same rights as most politicians.

We need to get rid of labels and the discrimination that derives from labels.  Unfortunately, obama just signed into law that discrimination lawsuits can now be more easily filed and allows "victims" to go back 30 years to sue. We are divided more now than ever and large corporations are better off to close their doors than to risk expensive and questionable lawsuits that are settled out of court in order to avoid even more expensive court proceedings.

Why not help all the people instead of a selected group instead?     Does the Inuits for preservation of the North imply that no white people can join or understand the issues of the tundra ? Why can't it be about the tundra and have no racial identification to it?     -----------------------     I get it --- sometimes the answer to social problems does nothing but guarantee more social problems -- are we tackling issues or racial issues wrapped up in anther issue ?|`|aVEVchFxaa	I just don't see what this has to do with 'Politics'.

The industrialized world ignores the poor and the 3rd world and that's what he's trying to shine a spotlight on.     What does being socialist have to do with being caring towards other humans?|`|bc03bfe3197d24248084be9b6a4c7dfcaa	ban of DDT based on faulty research, and stupid Rachel Carson.  the eagles were fed calcium poor diets so the DDT "caused" soft shells.

How did he get those mosquitoes in the jar in the first place?|`|9cpKYneZaa	Uh .... your question is misleading. Your own quote indicates that they were not infectious.    More to the point on this issue, he was trying to drive home a point that all it takes is a few insects and you have a terrible outbreak.    And by the way, you don't want to get infected with Malaria. Trust me on this one. You don't.
ltMCDs7Haa	wow 14 mins and no answer  i guess that is your answer ha nothing  absolutly nothing is good about this bill    well i lied the roads and buy american would help out but the rest of the spending would x that out and we will still end up tanked......    so what is good is still cancelled out by the extremely bad negating any postive effects from his 1,400 page bill.
avcjtqGtaa	Um... No.|`|U0Rvsabdaa	No. Smoking pot is illegal drug use, not speech.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Nope.  In texas, you need the real weed to be arrested.

It's only marijuana paraphernalia if it has marijuana residue in it and it is only considered sale of marijuana paraphernalia if they knowingly sell it to someone using it for weed or advertise it as such.|`|a4306cf4648141da0d25ebc2a0dbf89caa	Not in any way, shape, or form.    Who would ever think so in the first place?|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Does it hurt when you think like that?|`|ohxiNOFjaa	No paraphernalia assumes drug usage.  However if you've ever been to The Gas Pipe you can buy a bong.  They just have to call it a water pipe.|`|GFdppnFHaa	Not unless you're Cheech & Chong.|`|Eo8I3fbnaa	I live in Texas, we have smoke shops everywhere. The only thing i noticed is that there are signs on the walls saying you can't discuss illegal activities. Somewhere along those lines. Like you can't say why you are buying the bong outloud.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Does the paraphenalia talk? No one is speaking so no it doesn't defy Constitutional rights.|`|6EB2JDFmaa	Don't mess with Texas.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	No, I talk about it all the time...  Never once been busted for saying anything!    Maybe you could explain your argument a little better...|`|axHyoVqGaa	The only time that bongs, hookahs, papers and pipes are considered paraphernalia is when you get busted with pot or if they contain pot resin.  It is perfectly legal to own these things otherwise.  After all, they can all be used to smoke tobacco or for home decoration in the case of the more elaborate handmade hookahs and bongs.|`|LMgUpEgjaa	No, they can say anything about the paraphernalia they just can not possess it.   Texas has some interesting laws. For example if a woman shoots her husband she will get the death penalty; while a man  who shoots his wife, but says he was shooting at a deer and his wife just got in the way,  the  wife would be fined for the cost of the bullet.|`|1F11g2joaa	no its not speech|`|pF0G74Xiaa	not even close|`|HJaAmMKFaa	no. how do you come up with that? um, nope.

There is some question as to whether or not Barry Soetoro a/k/a 0bama, may have overextended his Indonesia student visa and is therefore here just as illegally as his aunt, let alone being a legal president!|`|2YyQAmufaa	To be honest why should we care about what any of these celebrities are saying?  Our society pour too much concern into what these silly celebrities say about America. Face it the Dixie Chicks are idiots.  They may sell records but they couldn't last a second in a real debate. I'm also guessing that they know very little about public policy.  As for Elta James, it seems like she's just pissed she didn't get to sing for Obama. By the way your free to boycott Elta James if you really want, it's a free country.  I personally wouldn't  boycott any of them because it's not worth my time.|`|77lIzq4Taa	It is only Unpatriotic and Treasonous to go to another country and demean the president in public to get a crowd response as the Dixie Twits did in England.

The Dixie chicks are whiny, bratty children.|`|supRA4eOaa	The Chicks' brassy lead singer, Natalie Maines, adlibbed to the British audience:   "Just so you know, we're on the good side with y'all. We do not want this war, this violence -- and we're ashamed that the President of the United States is from Texas."    When Etta starts criticizing OUR President on foreign soil........yes we will.    Until then....."Dissent is the biggest form of Patriotism."|`|KTM5JEkLaa	I don't care about Etta James, I own none of her albums, hadn't planned on buying them, and she wasn't in a foreign country in front of a crowd when she said it.  If she wants to say it, that's her right, just as it is the right of anyone, but it is my right as a consumer to not buy their stuff.  That said, I wish these stupid celebrities would just shut their high-school dropout yappers.|`|Ixss2irhaa	The Kenyan is NOT "my" President.|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Who?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	It is both of their right to say they don't agree.  If she doesn't want her citizenship, many do.    I may not support the things Obama does or what he stands for, but I still have respect for the office.

H4MILKhcaa	I have never heard of a crime being committed with one. Ever.     Sound like the state legislators in NJ are trying to ban the .50cal just so they can say that they banned a "Dangerous gun" despite the fact that few people own then, and they are very expensive to own. And you are correct that the Barrett is a large and heavy rifle. And the longest distance for a shot I've heard of is about 1 1/2 miles. And that was by a trained, experienced military sniper.|`|DenLZAL1aa	anti gun people watch too much tv. These clowns will try and destroy the 2 amendment but will defend to the death the 1rst. Politicians that can't stop crime will always come up with nonsensical laws, so they can say, "look what we are doing, we are fighting crime". Just another case of the inmates are running the asylum.    And the latest price I saw for a Barret is about $10,000|`|DTNlqnOEaa	Just to settle the facts about the "longest verified sniper kill " read this clip about the 5 man Canadian Forces sniper team in Afghanistan, who made "real world " long distance kills against the Taliban in 2003, using their issued Canadian Army 50 caliber rifles, while supporting the US Army's Delta Unit.    2,350 METRES is about 7,000 FEET, or over a mile and a half.     Read this '    http://community.discovery.com/eve/forum...    In the real world, a 50 caliber rifle is way too heavy, long and cumbersome to be  easilly used.     Jim B. Toronto.|`|FiYX5elCaa	i can see why this would be a difficult rifle to counter.the range is the key.  a 2000m range is a difficult problem to overcome. ss agents have a much wider perimeter to protect. imo i would go with high range, low penetration. ie lapua .338
AA11963685	First, I read your answers, in which there was a lot of suspicion and assumptions and paranoia - from both sides of the aisle.  Glad I decided to take a look myself.  I couldn't find anything partisan about it at all.  It's not a call to people to care more about their country, because to suggest to someone they don't already care is insulting.  Instead, it is asking people to become pro-active.      It doesn't speak to any of the wedge issues, and it's call for smaller government can appeal to both Republicans and Democrats because it's not specific about what part of the government should be smaller - just the government in general.  Republicans like small fiscal government and big government on social issues.  Democrats the opposite.  So it's important that its call to action remain as generic as it is.    I like it and think it can be a good thing.|`|2XgLQmhwaa	Wow. That was terrific. Very inspiring. I had never seen it before.|`|H0cbAlNXaa	I feel it's a bit absurd... Seriously.. You need to be born again because you have a new president?    Some people are insane.|`|AA11785060	No thanks to your propaganda|`|5d9pCmjyaa	Here's the real problem.  We know Govt. is not for the people any more - has not been for decades.    But we also know that the legal means of changing that don't work anymore.    And we know that the only alternative is illegal.    And we know that they have become extremely efficient at finding us, and imprisoning us.    We cannot win.  Voting means nothing if all you have to vote for is as corrupt as the one's you are voting out.  Overthrowing someone with a half million man military, fighters, bombers, and nukes is out of the question.    So what do you do?    The only thing available is what the Finish did to the Nazis - they peacably ignored their edicts and refused to contribute to their war effort.  In effect, they refused to pay taxes and obeyed their own laws regardless of what laws the Nazis passed.|`|AA10382849	Some of us don't need reminders.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	If it works for you jump in.

For the first time in a long time I had tears of joy in my eyes and felt goosebumps at the thought that just maybe there is still hope for this beloved country of ours.

I didn't wait until I was halfway through life to suddenly be proud.|`|bb5a54df57374dc4de372500ff862a7daa	I find the entire theme to be an insult to where they borrowed it - "Born Again"     "Born Again" is biblical and is being Born in the spirit with Christ Jesus.  It shames me that those on this video make claim to their Bible yet insult it by exalting even being American in comparison to being born again in Christ.    While I am proud of being American and do not need a reminder to be so, I will not hail America in comparison with God nor will I lift my President to be on a level as such.  I agree - we do in fact to be unified as a Country, but the example setters - Congress Majority and even at times minority, for example, certainly do not follow this and do not come close to setting it as example.      The problem is not the original founders ideas about America which I hold to - it IS however, the ideas of an immoral and greedy society and power hungry and greedy representatives of this Country.  Everyone has a hand in it, all one need do is look in the mirror.  True, so more than others, but everyone is guilty to some extent.     I did check the link and those that are contributors are filled with some hard liberals - this is a fake reach using biblical overtones - "Born Again" and "Spread the Word"   - I say - No thanks - I don't need to sign my allegiance to a plot.    EDIT  You call it stealing the joy, I call it being politically correct.  Christ didn't tell us to unite regardless of belief.  He told us to unite as one in him - that means not twisting his scripture to manipulate a situation.    EDIT - Read under press AND - do you remember this commercial during the campaigning?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olpCyDA4k...    Declare yourself - the sponsor of Born Again America ran this commercial - it is clearly NOT bipartisian|`|0RvtrkYOaa	Been American since I was born.

Each congressman needs to keep his own voters satisfied. Of course, no one knows what will help the economy or how long each facet of the stimulus will need to have a noticeable effect. It is sad though to watch our elected officials fiddle while Rome burns. However, politicians are elitists and above the economic problems the voters face on a daily basis. After China takes us over, we will see a real change. Whether we like it or not.

His plan his horrible and will not work. Why do democrats always think that if you throw money at a problem it will go away? The economy will straighten itself put like it always does.    Also tax cuts will work. They took us from a crashed economy after 9-11 to record highs in the markets! It is a proven remedy.

But if my house needs a new foundation I'm not going to fix the problem by renovating the attic and painting the walls, which is similar to what the "stimulus" bill plans to do. The root of the current mess is illiquid mortgages, and the subsequent lending freeze as banks try to figure out their assets. The problem is NOT geothermal pumps, children, broadband in small towns, states irresponsible spending plans, or the myriad other things in the bill.

You are starting with the assumption that a stimulus package will do something positive which is simply wrong.  It is like a near bankrupt person getting a new credit card and having a last spending spree - it feels good until it runs out but then they are worse off then before, with more debt.    you can't borrow and spend your way out of problems associated with too much borrowing and spending.  FDR tried the same thing and extended the depression by 7 years until WWII finally lifted it.    http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla...  --  I do have a family to feed.  What will yours do if we go bankrupt as Iceland did?  Google it.

Don't live in a bubble.  Research what you are talking about.  --  and Jason, there is no line item veto and thank heaven for that.  It is unconstitutional.

Tax cuts - major cuts like a suspension of federal taxes for 6 months - and severely cut federal spending.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	YES!  Finally, someone has come up with the CORRECT answer!    The "stimulus" isn't going to help anyone because it does two horrible things - it spends money we don't have, foisting the debt onto our grandchildren or further mortgaging our country into the hands of foreign nations that are buying our debt, and encouraging the runaway spending by middle class America that got us into this whole mess in the first place.    The problem with this country is that our entire economy has been based on debt that was just recently found out to be no longer good.  A massive amount of wealth in our country is fake and based on fradulent debt and it has collapsed now that people have tumbled to the dark of this bad debt.  The stimulus solution is asking for this fake wealth to continue being supported, which is the WRONG way to go.    Americans need to learn to STOP spending and start saving.  American business, people, and even government, needs to learn to live within its means.  The stimulus is encouraging the exact opposite, and that includes Bush's stimulus as well as the one on the table now.    I know people don't like to hear it, but tough love is necessary in this situtation.  People love to say that we need a fix right now, we need to "get the economy moving" but an economy moving on bad debt won't get very far.  We need to allow the REAL value of all things, from housing to businesses to be realized before we can really get out of this rut for good.  The stimulus will NOT do it - it only covers up the symptoms of the problem without addressing the root cause.|`|ex6fUw8Vaa	I am saying that there should be no stimulus package.

I all for putting people back to work and giving them jobs.      What I'm against is the colossal waste of money this stimulus bill contains.  However one feels about abortion right now, we do not need nor can afford 400 million to fund abortions around the world.  What possible connection to jobs here does that have?      We do not need to send billions of dollars to Obama's mafia thug-fest ACORN.  We do not need to spend 23 million dollars maintaining ATV trails.  We do not need to give Muslims tens of millions of dollars to build mosques in this country.  They have enough oil money for that and we do not need to be dhimmis for Obama's closet Islamism.      You can't stand Republicans and that's fine, but we are the bulwark against the stupidity exhibited in the White House.  This stimulus package contains a lot of gift money for all of Obama's pet projects and payoffs of his backers.    None of these items has anything to do with creating jobs or stimulating the economy.  And if that's the case, the last bailout didn't work either.  The banks got billions of dollars of our money and gave it to their causes.  But they still are not loaning the money and are pretty much not accountable for its waste.  There's a reason we called  TARP, CRAP.|`|0eFSeap5aa	Put aside the pork, which is most of this bill, government stimulus doesn't work.  The problem is that in order to provide people with wealth the government has to take it away from somebody else.  The net effect is that there is no new spending.    We're in this problem because of government meddling.  They flooded the financial markets with fiat cash, they manipulated interest rates, they encouraged moral hazard, and they squandered immense amounts of wealth.  Doing more of the same is only setting the stage for worse problems.      It's not a matter of being conservative or being liberal, its a matter of the government doing something that is going to make the problem worse and not better.|`|a405fe6055a8e90eb60d333024ff3097aa	Absolutely!

But as long as you were married within the 90 day period adjustment of status will be no problem even though the fiance visa is expired.  You won't be able to get a tax ID for him until you do this.  Also, it is advantageous to do so as soon as possible because he can obtain a work permit withing 90 days of filing the petition for adjustment of status which will allow him to work while his adjustment of status petition is pending.

Of course, no one seems to be willing to tell anyone where the money went, seems I heard about a million or so spent on someones restroom. Where is the common sense?   Can you spell Stone-walling?

yGXKYptjaa	I was thinking only the $160,000 they get a year plus any special sessions.  The offices might be in the cap building.  NOt sure about staff or the office at home, but Charley Wrangle was being investigating on some stuff about his office that he paid the rent on if not mistaken..    But i was just thinking the same thing myself, no joke.  i thought ok they are in Washington and need a save place to stay as there is so much crime in Washington, so what $5,000 a month for rent.  Then schools for the kids got to be private so they don't have to worry about them and they run $20-30,000.  Then entertaining the lobbyist and there are over 35,000 up there.  Remember many have their family working for the lobbyist and family that get paid to manage the lobbyist money.

YNZwoNK8aa	i would go up to him and tell him in a calm, relaxed manner that you felt that what he did is 'out of line', and inappropriate.  be sure to look him in the eyes when you tell him, to be sure that he'll take you seriously, without getting angry or upset.  speak in a firm, and direct manner, while trying not to sound too hostile.    some guys are just brought up in an environment where this sort of behaviour is acceptable.  this doesn't necessarily make them a bad person, but it is important to make it clear and direct that you find it inappropriate and you expect it to never happen again.  (clear communication seems to be the most important thing in any type of relationship)    if he responds respectfully, then i would leave it at that for now.  if it does happen again, then you definitely have grounds to go to your supervisor, and possibly their supervisor to file a 'sexual harassment' complaint.    hope this helps ... good luck~|`|9vvaFxEeaa	Tell him that it is unacceptable and that you will report him to his superior if it happens again.  You could report it now . . . that way you get some documentation if it does occur again.|`|AA12109395	This is definitely sexual harassment. No one has a right to touch you in that manner. There are two things you need to do right away or "trust" me things will get much worse for you. You need to talk to  your supervisor, advise them of what happened that it was "unwelcome", and that you would like to work in an environment that is not hostile . Then you need to talk with "Mac" and tell him that what he did makes you feel uncomfortable, it is not welcome, and not to ever do it again. Make it clear to everyone that you love your job there, however, you will not tolerate being disrespected. I realize that this is not going to be easy, but if you want to be equally respected and not be subjected to further harassment, SPEAK UP!|`|FTs2py0kaa	tough one.............call him to the side and tell him to quit the bullshit..............If he keeps it up, see the Caprtain...........|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Well, when he slapped your but, he sexually assaulted you.

Obviously has made you uncomfortable.     Hostile Work Environment      One that both a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive and one that a particular person who is the object of the harassment perceives to be hostile or abusive. Hostile work environment is determined by looking at all of the circumstances, including the frequency of the allegedly harassing conduct, its severity, whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.      Reasonable Woman Standard      A standard used by some courts to help determine if a sexual harassment case (where a woman is the plaintiff) was illegal action. In short, it states: one criterion for determining if the harassment was illegal is that the conduct must be offensive to any "reasonable woman."    Option One: Tell the guy he is making you uncomfortable and to back off....

There are many reasons, but what I would do is, do a little homework on that and see what you come up with, by contacting perhaps legal authorities that would know the actual answers.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	I'm not saying its impossible to shorten the length of time a person is on death row, but the amount of time a person is on death row has much more to do than just that inmate on death row.  It also has to do with how overcrowded the courts are right now.  A person is able to appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court and that takes quite some time to do.  I believe if it is possible without a reasonable doubt that the person did it and there is DNA linking them to the crime they should have maybe one appeal and that is it...  none of this trying to get off on a technicality or anything like that.
73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	You are right - the numbers vary by state, but capital punishment is WAY more expensive than life imprisonment.  It's not even close.    The reason for this is that the government wants to be as sure as possible of the suspect's guilt before handing down an irreversible sentence.    Many people think it's because of appeals, but most of the costs come before and during the trial.  For example:  - Pretrial motions and preparation (most capital cases take a year or more to come to trial)  - More expert witnesses are hired (on both sides)  - The trials themselves last almost 4 times longer (on average) than non-capital trials  - Because of the publicity generated by capital cases, more courtroom security is usually needed.  - Juries often need to be sequestered for the duration of the trial (the government has to pay for hotel, meals, security, etc. during this time).  - In capital cases there are two trials - one to determine guilt, and another to determine sentencing    Of course, in addition to all of the up-front costs, there are also increased appeals costs, which many people argue should be reduced.  But think about this: In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.      Speeding up or limiting the appeals process would greatly increase the likelihood of excecuting innocent people.    That would be the greatest cost of all.|`|trZ1NRLbaa	Whats the rush to kill these ppl.... How many are on death role only to be found not guilty due to  new DNA testing.|`|IVSqQQzlaa	It's because the costs and the time involvement with the inevitable appeals are more than it would cost to incarcerate the individual for the rest of his life.  It is considerably cheaper to house the person in prison than it is to pursue the death penalty against him.|`|u4ZwJc0Maa	Ask the judicial courts. They make the standards of what they what for the country because it seems that all criminals are guilty of mass murders in a heinous behavior. Also, you're right that it is expensive to spend for death penalty because of a poor economy state that we're in. Life's what we make to pursue punishment like this.|`|c07v7O80aa	The expense is both in the trial and the appeal. Death penalty trials, aside from being lengthy and hard fought, require multiple very expensive mental health experts, mitigation specialists, and defense investigators to fairly hear the future dangerousness issue and the various mitigation issues. The appeals are necessarily lengthy to make sure there has been every legitimate opportunity to explore even more issues. And that requires appeals attorneys on both sides and eventually more state attorneys to take over when it reaches federal court. Not to mention the two or three state courts involved in the appeal and the three federal courts. The paperwork alone runs something like fifteen legal boxes, and there are at least eight copies made along the way. And that means a bunch of support people. And more expert witnesses running anything from $5,000 to $20,000 a piece. You can't really cut the time down. It takes that long to move through all the courts and do all the new investigation and evaluation that needs to be done. And they're not very efficient prisoners. One to a cell. Lots of security. It is the lengthy appeals that makes capital punishment acceptable (and it IS approved by the majority in the US, no matter what the opponents say).     Now, life sentences get their appeals to, and they can run for many years. But they don't have the special issues that death cases have.

But with the way things are in our present world, such a government would fracture into separate factions, much as the USA and other colonies broke away from their mother countries.    Also, communication and transportation help to blend cultural differences.  We can get sushi and sashimi flown in to the US, so when we travel to Japan (at least for some of us), it's not, "Eewww!

7mOfekBWaa	Conservatism worked in the past because we did not have the technology we have today. As the name suggests, conservatives want limited interaction with global affairs (war is another story) and fall back to familiar positions. It often has the stigma of "backwards" thinking since it keeps to the time period it was developed in. Suffice to say, it just cannot work in today's world. With the 24 hour news media, technological advances, and science at an all time high, liberalism is constantly spreading. It's just how things go.    For the die hard conservatives- you're just clawing at water; you'll get nothing in the end. It's best to cup at it and catch the essentials.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	Whatever!

But as for rectifying our image, funny. We're all going to get a rectal awakening is more like it.|`|HTwuVeolaa	Hmmm, I smell a troll...calm down there buddy, this isn't a ground for arguing.     I wouldn't call being conservative "dirty, anti-working-class" as I am mainly conservative and work a low pay fast food job. Down here in Texas you bring up "Liberalism" in some of the rural areas (strongly conservative people who are at the polar opposite of the rich class) and everyone from little toddlers to old, rotting geezers bring out their guns, ready to kick ***. I also know Iran and other theocratic nations groups would do anything to give liberals a first class spot at the guillotine. I'd say liberalism has a while to go before it becomes "favorable" in the eyes of the world.    Personally I say it is good to be both. It is good and healthy to question things, but be too liberal and you get an immature, self-absorbed, evil, narcissistic dumb ***. Same goes for being too conservative. You'll end up an over-the-top religious (the "FIRE AND BRIMSTONE!!" type), close minded, monotonous bigot.     Personally I believe that solid liberals have a distorted, selfish sense of morals. They seem to imply that it is all about doing whatever you want because you are the god of your own life and nothing else matters but pleasing yourself. Solid conservatives tend to be a bit too close minded, not to mention they're violent. I tend to lean in the conservative direction, even though I'm a moderate. I am STRONGLY pro-life, strongly anti-gun control, an ADAMANT Christian, and strongly opposed to gay rights but I approach things with lots of skepticism like a liberal.    Don't forget, all things must be taken in moderation! That goes for everything in life.
mN6UKLfLaa	A 3.4 GPA is fine, actually, pretty good--as long as you maintain it. So that's not really something to worry about. Whether or not it is the right career for you , is a personal decision. Read up on it. L. Scott Turow's "1L" is a fairly accurate representation of law school (though not so much by today's standards.) That may help you decide.|`|kdTyaBmeaa	Need BA in order to get into law school. First year of law is general. You could consider being a lawyer representing a lab or get some law background and be very good candidate for some research companies.   One year of law is good for any career you chose.|`|MOALBorJaa	I agree with Maximom. Don't bother with law school. Do something useful with your life which will also allow you to live decently without student loans hanging over your head. A lot of lawyers are being laid off now in the current economic recession and  its not going to get any better for us.|`|z88IMXNFaa	There's a glut of lawyers.  Many grads can't get jobs at all.  Others can't make enough to live on and pay their student loans.  Law firms are outsourcing work to India as are major corporations.  It costs about $150,000 to go to a crummy law school - much, much more for a good school.  This is not the kind of debt you want hanging over your head on top of your college debt.    My advice is to stick with science.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	You'll have to do a lot of soul searching on what you truly want to do with your career.  Law school is after undergraduate work, so you could get your undergraduate degree in biology and get your law degree after that if you choose.  A 3.4 isn't a bad GPA, but I would work a little harder and get it closer to a 3.5-3.8 over the next 3 1/2 years.  Getting into law school also depends upon your LSAT.  The higher your GPA the lower your LSAT score can be, the lower GPA, the higher your LSAT needs to be.

Most counterfeiters make 20s, because people accept them without looking at them to carefully.  Lots of places won't even take $100 bills.

They've updated the $20 bill twice since then with all kinds of clever anti-counterfeiting features.

BkPN6pOjaa	It is about time.  This whole 'recession' can be fixed if corporations stop wasting so much money.  Money doesn't just disappear out of no where.  Part of the reason why the economy is doing bad is because big corporations like Microsoft and Walmart keep gobbling up the available money in circulation.  It's either wasted by overpaying the 'higher ups', or it simply sits in a bank drawing massive amounts of interest.  Either way, it's out of circulation and one way or another ends up in a bank.

c3DqvgE4aa	The war on drugs is an expensive battle, as a great deal of resources go into catching those who buy or sell illegal drugs on the black market, prosecuting them in court, and housing them in jail. These costs seem particularly exorbitant when dealing with the drug marijuana, as it is widely used, and is likely no more harmful than currently legal drugs such as tobacco and alcohol. There's another cost to the war on drugs, however, which is the revenue lost by governments who cannot collect taxes on illegal drugs. In a recent study for the Fraser Institute, Economist Stephen T. Easton attempted to calculate how much tax revenue the Canadian government could gain by legalizing marijuana.    The study estimates that the average price of 0.5 grams (a unit) of marijuana sold for $8.60 on the street, while its cost of production was only $1.70. In a free market, a $6.90 profit for a unit of marijuana would not last for long. Entrepreneurs noticing the great profits to be made in the marijuana market would start their own grow operations, increasing the supply of marijuana on the street, which would cause the street price of the drug to fall to a level much closer to the cost of production. Of course, this doesn't happen because the product is illegal; the prospect of jail time deters many entrepreneurs and the occasional drug bust ensures that the supply stays relatively low. We can consider much of this $6.90 per unit of marijuana profit a risk-premium for participating in the underground economy. Unfortunately, this risk premium is making a lot of criminals, many of whom have ties to organized crime, very wealthy.    Stephen T. Easton argues that if marijuana was legalized, we could transfer these excess profits caused by the risk-premium from these grow operations to the government:          If we substitute a tax on marijuana cigarettes equal to the difference between the local production cost and the street price people currently pay--that is, transfer the revenue from the current producers and marketers (many of whom work with organized crime) to the government, leaving all other marketing and transportation issues aside we would have revenue of (say) $7 per [unit]. If you could collect on every cigarette and ignore the transportation, marketing, and advertising costs, this comes to over $2 billion on Canadian sales and substantially more from an export tax, and you forego the costs of enforcement and deploy your policing assets elsewhere.     One interesting thing to note from such a scheme is that the street price of marijuana stays exactly the same, so the quantity demanded should remain the same as the price is unchanged. However, it's quite likely that the demand for marijuana would change from legalization. We saw that there was a risk in selling marijuana, but since drug laws often target both the buyer and the seller, there is also a risk (albeit smaller) to the consumer interested in buying marijuana. Legalization would eliminate this risk, causing the demand to rise. This is a mixed bag from a public policy standpoint: Increased marijuana use can have ill effects on the health of the population but the increased sales bring in more revenue for the government. However, if legalized, governments can control how much marijuana is consumed by increasing or decreasing the taxes on the product. There is a limit to this, however, as setting taxes too high will cause marijuana growers to sell on the black market to avoid excessive taxation.    When considering legalizing marijuana, there are many economic, health, and social issues we must analyze. One economic study will not be the basis of Canada's public policy decisions, but Easton's research does conclusively show that there are economic benefits in the legalization of marijuana. With governments scrambling to find new sources of revenue to pay for important social objectives such as health care and education expect to see the idea raised in Parliament sooner rather than later.|`|S2gIzdg9aa	i think that it should be legal because you cant stop it,its a natural flower that just makes you eat. so in reality it helps as foar as health reasons.lol|`|bqsbr0tPaa	Yes..er..no...er...maybe...

After spending 10 years in law enforcement, I am now in favor of legalization of most, if not all, drugs.  The cost and latent problems associated with drug law and enforcement far outweighs the harm of the drug itself.  Also, why punish someone who has caused no harm to anyone else?  If someone wants to get doped up and destroy themselves, so be it.  It's their body.  If they get stoned and do something to harm someone else, then charge them with that crime.  Making these substances illegal does not prevent people from using it, and legalization can at least provide some opportunity to control it through regulation/taxation/licensing.  Also, if you look at the history of drug laws, you will see that they are the result of government officials looking for ways to expand their power and budgets.      There are multiple sources on this, one person to research being Gary Potter, who has written on this extensively.  You should also look for information on the government's efforts to make marijuana illegal, look at the film "Reefer Madness," and take a look at medical issues of marijuana use.    One last point, look at the web site below, scroll to the bottom and click on "Reader Comments."|`|8wHg5MECaa	No|`|9a525103a8f9794c8bbbfec452cdfc7faa	YES  Penalties against drug use should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself. Nowhere is this more clear than in the laws against the possession of marijuana in private for personal use.    Marijuana prohibition needlessly destroys the lives and careers of literally hundreds of thousands of good, hard-working, productive citizens each year in this country. More than 700,000 Americans were arrested on marijuana charges last year, and more than 5 million Americans have been arrested for marijuana offenses in the past decade. Almost 90 percent of these arrests are for simple possession, not trafficking or sale. This is a misapplication of the criminal sanction that invites government into areas of our private lives that are inappropriate and wastes valuable law enforcement resources that should be focused on serious and violent crime.|`|oHSzktF4aa	No, it shouldn't be be legalized.|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	No.|`|5oSnHPYSaa	i say no, but this is the closest site i found =\|`|A90SRsTxaa	Yes. We should look at history to make a decision like this. You can look at crime statistics from the twentieth century and see the trends of over all crime as they rise to ridiculous levels during alcohol prohibition and then decline swiftly after. They continue to decline until you get to the war on drugs. At this point they make another radical spike. Most of the arguments against are lies created by those who would lose something by the legalization.(Companies profit from paper, plastic, fuel, forestry). The biggest one is the police. If we lower crime rates, which would happen if you legalized marijuana, many of them could be out of a job. A bunch of fear mongering, revenuers they have become.|`|JP2h62qiaa	Im pro marijuana use.

It does happen but no one really wants to hear that. If you honestly believe racism only effects a select few cultures you are truly ignorant and need to educate yourself a bit more before throwing victim flags. Does racism exist , yes. I doubt it will ever go away completely. People will always be capable of hatred. However.. there are also people who are capable of being truly color blind and those people are in the majority. Half full - half empty, it is all in your own perspective.. you can choose to pass on the hatred by asking questions like this that do little more then add fuel to the fire.. or you can pass on something positive for a change.|`|sagjCRvKaa	Yes, in Michigan, my friend lost her job and could not get another.

Cons:  -Away from family  -sometimes you will want to take a break, and you might not be able to  -some people can be *****    These are the only things I've heard my fiance complain about with the Corps      I would say that one of the CONS are death, but you can die anywhere.

Well, there is a bowling alley not to far from where the base is, so all the guys from all branches go there.  So there are the Marines in one lane and the Soldiers (Army) in another lane.

440edd460f8ad4ff578fa8b831c230eeaa	Based off of your questions today, I'm guessing you are considering your future in all three of these directions. All three are excellent choices but you need to figure out what you want to get of your experience and make your choice that way.    I have never served in the Air Force however based off of my experiences working with them, I have found a few things to be true.  All were very intelligent, easy going people who enjoyed their job for the most part and told a store about how they almost joined the Marine Corp. The base housing, dinning facilities and gyms that I have visited on Air Force bases have all been far nicer than what I have experienced in the Corp.    I've spent the majority of my career serving side by side with the Navy and been fortunate enough to spend some time with a few SEALs. Something you need to know up front there are far more paint chippers and pot scrubbers who washed out of BUDs than there are SEALs. Most of whom hate their job to the utmost and can't wait to get out. The few team guys I did get to interact with are much like all the guys in special communities, intelligent problem solvers that love and hate there job at the same time, quiet professionals for the most part that believe in patriotism, all love to shoot, and are in the gym as much as training allows.     The Marine Corp isn't a bad place, however it's a love hate job as well. the amenitys are not as nice as the Air Force, nor is there as big a choice of jobs as the Navy, but you could go Marine Special Ops. The team guys here are much like the team guys in Seals or Special Forces, we all just were different uniforms and do the same jobs a little differently.    Whatever your choice best of luck!|`|pwdv08hVaa	you just mentioned two branches and a special ops unit    do a little research|`|gAC4QY7gaa	Marines= Be mentally and physically strong    Air Force= Have a brain    Navy Seal= Be one crazy mofo that's tough as nails. lol.|`|9uzP3kn3aa	USMC- Enlisted: Four-year commitment, 17-29 years-old, High-school Diploma or GED, no felonies    USAF- Enlisted: Six-year commitment, not sure of the ages, High-school Diploma, no felonies    USN- Enlisted: To be a SEAL, you would have to be in the Navy or Marines to be selected.
AA11494150	Officers not showing up for court is for the most part a myth.     Our department gets a minimum of 2 hours overtime for court, some departments in the area get 4. Considering a speeding trial will probably not last more than 10 or 15 minutes, it is easy money. In addition, you can be written up for missing court, and the prosecutor will not be happy with you. Officers do not want to upset the prosecutor.     If the officer does not show, but has a valid reason, the trial will be rescheduled.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	100% of the time...

RQMT66hXaa	Im not in the marines, but I know several people who are, and I'll tell you what they told me.    Basic was probably one of the hardest things they had to go through, but once its all said and done, when they put the eagle globe and anchor pin in your hand it feels like your ontop of the world.  They said you will never be more proud of yourself for such a huge accomplishment.  They haven't mentioned regrets, they all seem very happy with the decisions they made about joining the corps.  I think they exaggerate basic a little, they said it wasn't everything they thought it would be from the commercials, and what they tell you on recruiting videos.      The thing about putting college on hold, is that they can pull you out of college and send you overseas when they want to.  If a degree is important to you, then you might want to get it first, then enlist.  But I have a friend who enlisted before college and he said they can't pull him out for two years because of something he earned, you should ask a recruiter about it, sorry I don't remember what he called it.    Hope that was a little help...

These new limos get fewer than 10 mpg for you "green" folks out there.    8) He spent millions putting a basketball court into the White House.    9) Millions of his bailout money to Bank of America funded a large pre-Super Bowl party.    10) He nominated one of the most scandalous, unethical people on the planet to be Attorney General (Eric Holder). Holder pardoned a terrorist arms dealer in order to impress the dirt ball's defense attorney who was a close confidant of Al Gore in hopes that Holder would be nominated Attorney General if Al Gore won the Presidency after Clinton (Holder was deputy AG under Janet Reno). He also blatantly lied about how the Elian Gonzales case was handled, stating that no night-time raid was conducted (it was) and that it was handled "sensitively" (despite the pic of a federal agent pointing an MP5 at a 6 year old with his finger on the trigger [violating the first rule of gun safety]). His ethical transgressions could fill a tome.    11) He nominated a bona fide member of the National Socialist Party of the U.S. to be in charge of the environment. Her name was quickly removed from the Socialist party web site shortly thereafter.    12) He's closing Gitmo while we're seeing former detainees back committing acts of terror against the U.S. and our allies. These 200+ current detainees will likely end up inside the borders of the U.S. as a result. Smart move.    13) We've seen the largest post-election stock market slump in recorded U.S. history shortly after his inauguration.

In fact in 1933 the unemployment rate was over 30 % in 1937 it was 10 % The New Deal was a great national program that put people back to work, built a modern infrastructure, and provided a foundation to build on that allowed us to win WWII. Progressives are just that, they want to improve the lot in life of the American worker and the families that depend on them. Populists are us the people, working for the people, not for the big business or bankers. The New Deal supported the growth of what became the middle class.

YBbJ2QZJaa	I hope so.|`|1KGXts5Daa	It depends Steven.  I would have to know the wording contained in his MOU (Memorandum of Understanding).  An MOU is a contract between management and a union of organized labor.  Most organized labor unions may exercise the right to strike as an absolute last resort, after contract negotiations have either come to a stalemate; or, more often the case, management is found to have been "bargaining in bad faith" (lying, basically).    Usually, at that point a negotiator, arbitrator, or mediator is called upon to serve as a neutral third-party in order to get management and labor back to "the table" to work things out.  If, even after that, there is still no agreement - or if "bad faith bargaining" practices continue - as a last resort some sort of public statement is made by the union workers to show that their management is not playing fair; and that sometimes takes the form of a walkout ("strike").    Not all unions are allowed to strike.  Organized labor unions such as Public Safety (local government Police and Fire Departments, for instance) have "No-Strike" clauses written into their MOU's - for reasons that should be fairly obvious.    If your father were the member of a union, he would be protected from any Adverse Action from management of his corporation due to his participating in any union-sanctioned activity - including a strike - assuming his union has that option.    It bears to keep in mind, however, the fate of the striking Air Traffic Controllers in 1980.  Their "management" at the time was the federal government.  When Reagan took office, he summarily fired all of them and privatized the FAA.|`|9vvaFxEeaa	It would be unusual if they could not fire him.  He would need an employment contract and if he did, striking would be a reason to fire him under the contract.      This is why employees unionize, for the power of the pack.  However, the employer could just fire everyone.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Yeah, but if they're going to fire him they would fire all the other hundreds, or thousands, of striking workers at the same time. And that's not something they want to do. There's safety in numbers.

DTSUJe2oaa	(D) none of the above~    It may be a surprise to most Americans, but the individual whose ideas on justice and law shaped the more libertarian aspects of the American constitution was not Benjamin Franklin, James Madison, or Thomas Jefferson. The individual was not even an American or part of the American revolution. Many of the concepts outlined and explored in the Bill of Rights have their home in the mind of the quiet Italian judicial philosopher Cesare Becaria. Becaria's classic work Of Crimes and Punishment was considered the Enlightenment's response to the draconian judicial systems on the European monarchies. Many of the ideas and reforms that Becaria advocated for, including trial by jury of one's peers, prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, and speedy and public trials, became (at least in theory) the foundations for the emerging American justice system.    Ironically, the reform that Becaria spent the most attention on in Of Crimes and Punishment, the abolishment of the death penalty, was not taken up by the founding fathers. Becaria was particularly disgusted with state sanctioned murder -- which he considered to be "a war of the nation against a citizen." He thought it "absurd that the laws, which are the expression of the public will, which detest and punish murder, should themselves commit murder; and to deter citizens from killing, should ordain killing in public." In America, where many praised his work, these cries against the death penalty were ignored.~

Farmland was being abandoned because of a combination of a glut on the commodities market, ecological disaster in the Midwest, and massive shortsightedness by banks that repossessed productive agricultural land and made farmers homeless without any thought of who would buy and work that land.    FDR correctly saw that the Depression represented an opportunity to not just get the country back to work but to also build up vital new infrastructure at the same time.  And the New Deal was a big success in that regard.  Men didn't want to live on charity, they wanted to work and do something productive.|`|pF0G74Xiaa	The terrible state of our nation after Hoover got though with it
JDltTREfaa	No.    The banks were required to make loans to low income people by the federal government beginning over a decade ago.  By making loans to a large number of people who had no money for down payments and by issuing interest only loans, it was inevitable that there would be a flood of foreclosures when the bubble burst in the housing market.  (What goes up ALWAYS goes down.  House values could not continue to go up - particularly when we entered a recession.  As soon as house values dropped the homeowners who were in "no money down,"  "interest only," or "variable interest" home loans owed more than their homes were worth.)    This is what happens when the federal government tries to control and regulate matters within the private industry in a way that runs contrary to good business sense.

Reid, D-Nev., said he is "cautiously optimistic" that the Senate could finish work on the bill Friday, but did not rule out returning next week for more votes.  Reid lent positive words to an effort led by Sens. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, to cut billions of dollars from the Senate stimulus package.  "The main reason that I look forward to tomorrow is that there are a number of Republican senators working with Democratic senators trying to work on an alternative proposal," Reid said.  But Reid indicated that talks on the alternative proposal were volatile and said that if it appeared that lawmakers are "spinning our wheels" Friday in attempting to craft a compromise, then he would schedule a vote Sunday on limiting debate on stimulus measure.  Reid said votes on several pending amendments are set for Friday morning.  A provisional deal was reached earlier Thursday between a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers, led by Nelson and Collins, to cut $107 billion of spending from the roughly $935 billion economic stimulus plan, according to two senior Democratic Senate aides.  The deal would also see an additional $20 billion in infrastructure funding added to the bill, meaning the net reduction would be $87 billion.  The senators are working from the $885 billion plan that initially came out of the Senate committees, rather than the $935 billion version that is currently being debated on the Senate floor.  This would bring the net cost of the plan agreed to by the bipartisan group down to slightly below $800 billion, the amount targeted by President Barack Obama.  There a wide range of programs that would receive less money under the proposed compromise.  These would include a $1.5 billion reduction in the $9 billion in grants to expand broadband Internet service to rural and underserved parts of the country.  Nearly $10 billion of the funds that were to be directed to the Department of Energy would be cut, including $500 million of the $2.6 billion for the department to invest in renewable energy technology.  More than $20 billion of the money for educational programs would be removed. So too would nearly $200 million in compensation for Filipino World War II veterans.  Just under $40 billion in the stabilization grants would also be removed.  Staff are currently drafting an amendment that would be introduced to the stimulus plan on the floor of the Senate, possibly later Thursday, said the aides.  A group of between 15-20 senators have been meeting throughout the day to try and remove spending that lawmakers deemed to be non-stimulative.  It wasn't immediately clear that the group of lawmakers has reached a deal with Senate Democratic leadership over the plan. Nelson said earlier Thursday he was keeping both the White House and the Senate Democratic leadership apprised of the group's progress.   -By Corey Boles, Dow Jones Newswires; 202-862-6601; corey.boles@dowjones.com   Click here to go to Dow Jones NewsPlus, a web front page of today's most important business and market news, analysis and commentary: http:// www.djnewsplus.com/nae/al?rnd=U6u0MVX3h6...

We cannot get back from this now anyway, its all academic. The world economy is collapsing not just ours. Its too late. I shook my head at Obama's little tantrum because he is getting opposition to his stimulus package. A man who leads our country and still hasn't grasped why we are in this mess in the first place, you can't fix something if you can't recognise the causes. He really thinks that it is the Republicans fault when infact its a result of decades of poor government, the Democrats do the same thing everytime and the Republicans do the same thing and now its finally caught up with us, they have all contributed to this mess, the economy is a big ship that turns slowly. The rest of the world, especially Europe are actually faring far  worse than we are , look at poor old Iceland, however they have had socialist governments for a long time and that just makes  it worse. If Obama wants to throw billions at this, let him. It won't do anything except maybe have a short bandaid effect at best, this recession is going to run its course what ever we do, we can do this with or without  spending billions . The money doesn't exist anyway, we simply don't have it.We will recover eventually, but we are going to have our nice, comfortable and indulgent lifestyles shaken up a bit.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	I was wondering....if we are in sooo bad of shape which i believe we are....why are they just gonna hand out money...why dont they put it somewhere that they KNOW for sure it would help us....Instead of giving us a check in the mail soo some can go to mcdonalds for the next 5 weeks...ya know....Many people dont know how to spend there money....i dunno we'lll just haveta see.....|`|GaGSjIkNaa	...and why weren't YOU on here with the question of where the H**L is our money that DISAPPEARED IN IRAQ?

AA11312653	Your question is backwards. The appropriate question is "Is there any rationale giving our government just authority to play Nanny Government and make these people's reproductive health care choices for them, rather than butting out allowing people to choose for themselves from among those options that are legal in their nation?" That some Americans personally disapprove of abortion is does not represent a compelling interest on the part of our government.

At least the millions spent in Iraq freed its people from tyranny, mass graves, mass executions, children's prisons, rape prisons, torture cells, and whatever else they had to endure.  Now they are tasting democracy for the first time in thousands of years, its no wonder they have problems getting used to that.    Why spend millions to study bridges for the next 5 years?  How many people is that going to employ?  When you drive past a bridge, how many people do you see standing there studying it?  The answer is zero.    How about putting just this in the bill, for every full time person a company hires for the year and if that person works a full year, that company gets a $5,000 dollar tax break.  By the time the year is over, all those people will have spent money on the economy thus ending the recession.|`|zgugU4Gtaa	The money was withheld from FAMILY PLANNING AGENCIES.

There are NOT fully formed tiny human beings hiding in there.

My baby is not even 1 yr.  old and I'm pregnant again. I don't want kids so close together.'  So the doctor said: 'Ok, and what do you want me to do?'  She said: 'I want you to end my pregnancy, and I'm counting on your help  with this.'  The doctor thought for a little, and after some silence he said to the  lady: 'I think I have a better solution for your problem. It's less  dangerous for you too.'  She smiled, thinking that the doctor was going to accept her request.    Then he continued: 'You see, in order for you not to have to take care of  2 babies at the same time, let's kill the one in your arms. This way, you  could rest some before the other one is born. If we're going to kill one  of them, it doesn't matter which one it is. There would be no risk for  your body if you chose the one in your arms.'    The lady was horrified and said: 'No doctor! How terrible! It's a crime to  kill a child!'    'I agree', the doctor replied. 'But you seemed to be ok with it, so I  thought maybe that was the best solution.'    The crime is the same!
Ne4yyKiOaa	The first marijuana law found so far was a 1905 El Paso, Texas law. It, and most of the other laws in the southwest that followed, was motivated by racial prejudice against Mexican immigrants. The first state law was a 1913 California law that received little notice. It was promoted by the pharmaceutical industry that saw marijuana as a competitor. That was followed by a 1914 Utah level that was simply a Mormon religious prohibition enacted into law. By 1930, about thirty states had passed laws against marijuana for one reason or another. In the southwest and south, it was primarily racial prejudice against Mexicans and other racial minorities. In the northern states it was primarily the fear that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana -- exactly the opposite of the modern marijuana gateway myth.|`|lYQDCJgeaa	Hemp (Cannabis sativa) was first brought to North America by the Puritans.    In the 17th century hemp was encouraged by the government in the production of rope, sails, and clothing; however, hemp use declined in the late eighteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, cannabis became a common ingredient in medicine and was openly sold at pharmacies.    After the Mexican Revolution of 1910, a wave of Mexicans immigrated to the United States and introduced the American public to recreational cannabis use.    The first significant instance of cannabis regulation appeared in Washington D.C. in 1906. Prohibitions of cannabis soon followed in the other states. By the mid-1930s, cannabis was regulated in every state by laws instituted through The Uniform State Narcotic Act.    The federal drug policy of the United States began with the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937, and the establishment of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.|`|9bb908381a39b6d676c09830fc057c56aa	It is all about fear and money.

UZBULUuraa	Because it will not stimulate the economy and it lacks tax cuts which are the only thing government has ever done to stimulate the economy. Re-circulating money has never ended a recession and in many cases they have prolonged it. Much of it is pork that Democrats have been promising for 14 years and now that they have control of Congress and the White House they are paying off because the Republican Congress under Clinton stopped them for 6 years and Bush stopped them for 8 more. I support the Republican opposition to spending all this money that they don't really have to spend.|`|xt9f4j0Gaa	Isn't the definition of insanity......doing the same thing over and over and over again with the same result?|`|aawkOyZtaa	THE OBAMANISTA REGIME'S SCAMS, SCANDALS, CONTROVERSIES, LIES, DECEPTIONS AND EMBARRASSMENTS       Attorney General Eric Holder, revealed to be the man who, as Clinton's deputy AG, was the driving force behind the sentence commutation of 16 murderous FALN terrorists.       Attorney General Eric Holder's law firm represents 17 Gitmo terrorists and he is a driving force behind the closing of Gitmo.       On Inauguration Day, Obama granted only ABC News an interview, after they paid him $2 million to sponsor his DC Neighborhood Ball.       After three days in office, Obama ordered an attack on homes in Pakistan. Twenty-one people were killed but only five were reported to have been terrorists; the rest of the incinerated and dismembered victims were children, their moms and dads, and other civilians, according to the New York Times, the AFP, the AP and many other news sources.       On 23 January 2009, Obama demanded that GOP leaders stop listening to Rush Limbaugh or else things would not go well for them during his regime.       William Lind, a powerful defense industry lobbyist, was appointed by Obama to be deputy defense secretary, despite all the rants and promises Obama made about never appointing a lobbyist to a position of power in his regime.       On 23 January 2009, Obama lifted the ban on federal tax dollars funding abortion mill operations in Third World countries where eugenics are now again used to control the population.       Two days after seizing power, Obama signed an executive order to close Gitmo, making it clear that the comfort and happiness of the terrorists therein, and Europe's opinion of us, are far more important than national security and the lives of American families.       Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refuses to reveal all of the big foreign donors to her husband's "foundation," but the Washington Times says huge sums of money came from the People's Republic of China via a secret 2006 stock transaction.       On 24 January 2009, despite his hundreds if not thousands of pledges and promises of total transparency in his regime, Obama held a secret closed-door meeting with his economic advisors as anger over his $1 trillion "economic stimulus" spending scheme, refusing to allow the media and American people access to what was discussed.       On 26 January 2009, Rep. John Boehner revealed that Obama and his Obamanistas in the Congress had added language in the Democrats' stimulus bill that would allow Obama's infamous voter fraud organization, ACORN, to receive billions of dollars in federal funding under the farcical guise of "neighborhood stabilization activities."       On 26 January 2009, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Susan Rice, stated that the Obama regime seeks direct negotiations with the terrorist regime of Iran.       In a shocking insult to our military's heroes, on 20 January 2009, Barack Obama became the first president in 56 years--since its inception--to skip the Salute to Heroes Inaugural Ball, which is held in honor of Medal of Honor recipients, Purple Heart recipients, paralyzed veterans and other military heroes. Obama did, however, find time to attend the Neighborhood Ball, which was filled with Hollywood's ultra elite.       On 26 January 2009, with hat in hand and apologizing for the United States, Obama gave his first formal television interview as president not to an American network, but Al-Arabiya, saying America must stop "dictating," a move and statement that was immediately seen by extremist Muslims as a sign of sure weakness and fear.       James B. Steinberg, whom Obama nominated to be deputy secretary of state, told the Foreign Relations Committee in writing that Americans have a free speech right guaranteed by the Constitution to taxpayer funded abortions.       On 26 January 2009, Timothy Geithner was sworn in as Obama's secretary of the treasury despite having serious tax problems and having had an illegal alien housekeeper.       On 27 January 2009, Obama, for some reason confused, attempted to walk through a window to get back into the White House rather than using a door. There were no calls from liberals to have him take a urinalysis to determine why he did this.       The Obamanistas added $325,000,000 to the economic stimulus bill for a program to teach Americans how not to get the clap and other STDs. More additions:     The Obamanistas added $1.5 billion to run a contest to capture carbon.       The Obamanistas added $45 million for ATV trails.       The Obamanistas added $572 million to create 1,235 Coast Guard civilian jobs at $460K each.       The Obamanistas added $4 billion for Obama's voter fraud unit that is under federal investigation for massive fraud.       The Obamanistas added $3.5 billion for new education facilities.       The Obamanistas added $200 million for DoD alternative energy vehicles.       The Obamanistas added $600 million for new government cars.       The Obamanistas added $134 million for hospices.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well, let me take you around the circle in answering this.

Obama's package is worth nearly 900 billion and in its current form is pork laden and does very little to stimulate the economy.  Also the "buy American" clause is troubling as it appears to be protectionism and will set off trade wars.  I also don't see how much money is going into the taxpayer's hands in the form of rebates.

It is only now being "debated" in the senate and was just approved last week in congress.  The current bill contains enough pork to feed several hungry countries.  It will do little or nothing to create jobs and the only thing it stimulates is greater borrowing by this country.  It contains such tidbits as $600 million for a new fleet of cars for government.  Or how about $21 million to re-sod the mall in Washington. How about $44million to renovate the headquarters of the Department of Agriculture again in Washington.  Matter of fact, I noticed that a lot of the money will go to things in Washington.  If you do a little research of this pork-filled "stimulus" package you would find that job creation and actual stimulation will amount to less than 10% of the entire bill and that won't show up for about 2 years.

"Its funny how some of you wont even entertain the notion, like it isnt even possible for the government to do such a thing."    The HIV virus started appearing regularly in the early 1980's, but it has been discovered in tissue samples of people who died in the 1950's. This was before genetic engineering was possible. The structure of DNA was not discovered yet.

The HIV virus originated in Africa from an unknown source.|`|AA10783710	This is absolute nonsense.  What you are reading is creative fiction.  The fact that someone intertwines real names and places does not make a story true.    Read up on the virus and you will discover that scientists actually have blood samples dating back to the 1950s from people who died of mysterious illnesses that they couldn't diagnose.  It turns out the AIDS virus did indeed originate in Africa.  They can even trace the general route of how it spread.    There is no doubt about the origin of AIDS.  These blood samples from 50 years ago show the same DNA patterns as the modern version of the disease.  There is no scientific doubt about how it originated.    Way back in the early 1980s, the tv news magazine, "60 Minutes" did an episode about the origin of the virus.  The way it spread was traced back to "Patient Zero", a gay Canadian Air France flight attendant.  While the article below dismisses his complicity in the spread, it is undeniable that he had sex on practically every trip, so figure he worked 45 weeks a year, and made two flights a week, so that would be 90 men he'd infect every year (yes, he was that promiscuous).    Even if the polio vaccine story has some truth to it, there was no intention involved.  They didn't even know about AIDS back then.

However, there is an interesting theory about a group of European doctors who set up expensive labs in Africa, around 1960, to test  and create the polio vaccine using experimental monkeys. It is thought that the virus was created there by accident and covered up. They quickly abandoned the large facilities they built in the wilderness, leaving everything behind, including the children whom they had vaccinated. This was a documentary on  one of the  science health channels but not much proof.|`|AA10317675	I think the notion that anyone had the ability to create a virus in the early 80s or earlier is beyond rediculous.|`|d13c4c2bb60f93e106a5ef936fc63dc9aa	Now i'm going to sound sadistic here, but if they did in fact create it, I think it is having it's desired effects.

I have read several articles on people history that worked  in eugenics who talked many times about different types of population control, and breading the best possible genes into people. Adolf Hitler was into this thing very deeply and the  powerful people in the NWO have  talked about how to instill the most effective ways to control the population of the world and the Rockefeller family is very high up in the chain of command in the NWO. Thats why his family is chosen to fund many of these population control projects.|`|1MrNGe55aa	HIV from what I personally can tell was created not on purpose but from what I can gather from government funded scientists in africa trying out new Polio vaccines of the era, from what I read, the polio vaccines required hemoglobin for part of the serum and they ran out of hemoglobin, and instead of waiting for the government resupply to arrive the impatient scientists (yes, patience is the biggest virtue)  decided to use hemoglobin derived from chimp's instead. Unfortunately the hemoglobin derived from primates they used was infected with SIV the primate equivalent of HIV which was long documented before the rise of HIV even was acknowledged.  This caused a recombinant cross-mutation effect in humans thus fueling the rise of HIV/AIDS in man.  Although I have also read recently that tests had been done on samples taken from people much much earlier and that HIV roots date back to before the 1950's and as possibly as far back as the early 1900's.  . So it is hard to tell for sure, albeit impossible.  But if I had to personally guess, i'd say all of this information is a fabrication and indeed the government created this virus with intent to destroy the black population or homosexual population, which of the two im not certain, but the virus backfired thus mutating its way to whites also.  I also believe hurricane katrina was caused by the HAARP array and/or Satellite based weather modifiers to destroy the predominantly black populations of the area to reduce the stress of welfare on the federal government.. I know it sounds terrible, but cmon... would we put anything past a government who has been known to test virus's on the black populations in the past (Tuskegee syphilis experiments of 1932) ?|`|f87aecace64788161262ee4e762de87aaa	I have heard similar arguments and given the history of this great land and the people who inhabit it... I believe it. Not only is it highly probable but there has been proof to show our governments misconduct and cover ups as it relates to AIDS.    I don't know if you recall what was said about AIDS when it first came out... but it was something along the lines of being found in African monkey's and being transmitted sexually. Well that left you to reason that someone human was having sex with the monkey... Well  monkeys have lived over in the jungles of Africa alongside Africans for centuries. Something just didn't set right with that story from the first time I heard it. Why would Africans be having sex with the monkeys. This theory is similar to that of the "serial killers". "We don't do that"    .. I think the story might have flew if they said "Bob" did it especially since he has a reputation for fondling the farm animals.    AIDS was created in a laboratory with the specific intent of genocide against a group of people.    Guess who?... Which group of people?|`|8vMmUbcqaa	Operation MK NAOMI is well known to those with access to such files. The other MK project MK ULTRA is declassified so I would do some research on both those topics I have listed. People have idiot syndrome they store stupid half truths as fact then due to a weak mind can`t cope with the idea they have been fooled and are in fact wrong.

It just happens to start in the same country that has tribal wars, warlords, hunger, poverty and other issues. They probably figured that Africa was the best place to experiment with it since, you know, no one cares about Africa, right? (Sarcastic). Some ignorant redneck probably made up the whole story of some native African having sex with a monkey to cover it up. I think it's a highly possible theory with good evidence backing it. I'm totally open to it, especially with my theories on 9/11, as well, I don't really trust our government a whole lot, nowadays. It's just biological warfare plans gone horribly wrong, just like in a comic book (Science gone wrong, superhero emerges), except this isn't a superhero, it's a virus that's extremely hard to work with and cure (And yes, there is a cure. I've come to believe that for every disease, there is a cure, because all cells adapt and mutate).|`|bVbwbqtpaa	I'm still asking myself how Magic Johnson magically found the cure for AIDS for himself?!

SaxjkMbSaa	I agree with you and disagree with Affirmative Action    I am a white male who has lost 2 jobs as a direct result of Affirmative Action.    I was working on a construction job years ago in NYC and a promotion for a union " featherbedding " job came up whereby a young black male and I were both being considered for this job requiring someone to sit in a chair all day and turn a wrench 6 inches every 2 hours to turn a sandblasting pot on and off.  Harlem CORE picketed the jobsite with signs demanding " Give the job to the black man " and the following day I was informed that ( despite the fact that I had more experience & seniority over the black male ) the black male was given the job.    On another occassion; I took a Federal Test with one job opening. There was only one other person taking the test ( to obtain an opening in another department ) and this other person was a black female. I score a 91 on the exam and the black female score a 78 but she was given the job because as it was explained to me her " category " which was " B F M " A/K/A " Black Female Modified " allowed her to get a much lower score than my " category " which was " W M M " A/K/A " White Male Modified "    Affirmative Action is just a fancy name for reverse discrimination or reverse racism|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	I agree with you 100%.  I'm bi-racial and I don't fill out the parts of forms that ask for my race or gender unless it's absolutely necessary.  If I can't earn something on my own merit, then I don't want it.  Yes, I've turned down jobs because I felt that the company was treating me like a "token".  That was a long time ago though.    Other things that you didn't mention is how others (co-workers and students) feel towards you if you get into the job/school because of your race.  They are resentful and I can't blame them.  When I work my way up then someone gets promoted because of their race or gender, it angers me.  I worked for it and they should too.    I find affirmative action very insulting.  I grew up in a home where skin color wasn't important since we were all different shades.  My parents told me that I could do whatever I wanted to.  I believed them.  Now there are these idiots who tell me that I can't compete because of my skin color and my gender.  Ugh.  They're too late.  I already did and I've been successful in my field without their "help".  I feel like the affirmative action people treat me like a second class person.

White people get minority scholarships at HBCU's too. Affirmative Action helps ALL types of people.    ETA- There are far more non-deserving, non-minorities who who get ahead because of connections, than minorities who get ahead because of affirmative action. Look at the US political scene. Think of all the C students who get into Ivy League schools because of legacies.|`|jgGEKeSxaa	I feel the same about this as you do, yet I also wonder if minorities and women would have as many opportunities as they now enjoy if we hadn't taken "affirmative action" to combat discrimination. Some social ills just never go away without regulation.     Here's the deal: I support the right of an individual to sue a potential employer on grounds of discrimination. If the plaintiff in such a lawsuit can show evidence that the employer refused to hire for no other reason besides race or sex, there should be some kind of reparation, though not necessarily forced employment.    I would also support some regulations mandating that employers hire a certain percentage of discrimination prone groups who apply for a job and who are well qualified for the position. But if the employer can show reasonable cause why the potential employee is not qualified for the job, there should be no requirement to hire the individual in question.      Beyond these simple measures, I don't think there's much else we can do without being unfair to the regular people who don't encounter discrimination on a regular basis.

Jindal is now exposing all that corruption and he will continue to do so.|`|AA10152346	O.k. so what's the "islamic extremist " look?    Is there a standard?

eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	The original stimulus was passed by the Dem congress.  This stimulus was written by the Dem congress.  First one didn't work, why do you think this one will?  Let's not do the same thing that doesn't work over and over again.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	Did the first stimulus plan work?  Seems to me the economy got worse, and now the democrats want to do it again!    A definition of insanity, doing the same thing over and over again while expecting different results.|`|o0UD2YvPaa	I believe that the democratic controlled congress passed that stimulus bill last year.  We the people actually received money.....you ain't getting jack to help you this time.  600M for brand new govt cars.....how does this help you, 400M for global warming research....does not help me, 250M for hollywood to by film....how does this help me.......this is nothing but paying back the ones who threw so much money into obamas campaign, so Obama rewards them with our hard earned tax dollars.  They want the economy stimulated......well it is you and me who do that when we have enough money in our pockets to make purchases.  As of right now, we don't do that, Just think 1 trillion dollars do you have any clue as to how much every american man woman and child would get if they gave us this money.....but Obama said "you cant trust people to what is right"  Now he does not trust us with OUR own money, but we are suppose to trust him and his govt. which is being filled with tax evaders......I believe that I am more trust worthy with my own money that he and the govt are with my money.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Go figure.

I heard lots of complaints with the Bush stimulus plan and it didn't work. I thought it is a waste. Now that we know the first one didn't work, what makes you think this one somehow will work? On top of that, Obama's is totally loaded with tons of Pork that has NOTHING to do with stimulating the economy.

5PIgZ7tFaa	Anything that would help get rid of those filthy things would be a real help to the human race in general. Anybody that's FOR nuclear weapons is an idiot.|`|xugO6cDsaa	In reality we need the nuke. Mayeb both us and Russia don't need as much, since it really doesn't take that many to end everything. And for those that say STRENGTH through force, no one will be left alive to write the history of who dropped more nukes and who won, idiot.|`|BVbDNm23aa	yeah that sounds great, Russia will probably just pretend its getting rid of its nukes and then after we get rid of ours, nuke us to hell. Nukes are what stops major world powers from attacking each other, if anything they are a good thing.|`|ErGQOhjqaa	Great idea!!  Now, you just call up Putin and tell him you would like for him to destroy all his nukes............... and then........yeah that's it....we'll do likewise.  I'm sure he will begin the dismantling immediately.|`|7G9PlO6Raa	Obama might need to rethink this he hasn't made any foreign friends with his "Buy American" part of his stimulus.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	An odd time to bring this kind of thing up ... especially with tensions so high between India & Pakistan ... and Iran and North Korea both launching long range missiles.    The skeptic in me says that this is a "misdirection" ploy by Obama (similar to his "close GITMO" and "no lobbyists" thing).  But I am still hopeful that he'll follow through on this one.  It has been clear for over a decade now that Russia is trying to rebuild itself as a military AND economic Superpower and has been attempting to bully its former Warsaw Pact allies back into its sphere.    I do not think Russia will even consider talks unless the Chinese are required to participate.  Considering the number of loan papers China now holds on behalf of the U.S., that will be an interesting conversation for President Obama.|`|cae903cea51e27b7f33677a9e540a4b5aa	I agree with some other answerer's that keeping our nukes will prevent us from being attacked. Have we not noticed that even N Korea, an unstable nation also have nukes that can be used ? Let alone with Russia's behavior towards us, we can never be too safe from any fallout with either of them.|`|1nEjLRRNaa	what happens when an asteroid the size of Texas comes towards america and we have no nukes?     i say Obama should collect all nukes sit on them and then get blown up by them       Heil your Fuhrer|`|V4UWi4w4aa	You're a moron.  Peace through STRENGTH.  That is the ONLY thing that has prevented those cun+s in Russia from attacking Europe or the US.    F the Russians.    APPEASEMENT NEVER WORKS, YOU PU$$Y!

That money will be reclaimed by the VA  at whatever your Disability % is before any  VA check is issued...  (They didn't tell you that one...huh)  You should have an answer within 45-60 days  from your C&P exam...    If you have any more questions  please email me...

9uzP3kn3aa	I am not a spouse. I am a soldier, however. It all depends on what unit he goes to straight out of AIT. Most non-combat arms jobs don't get deployed right away. Now as far as PCS, his first duty station most likely will not be Korea or something like that. Almost every duty station you can go with him to. Just to let you know, also, Chances are he will get deployed eventually, go to training at either JRTC or NTC which are both about one month or so, or go to the field for periods of time. You will make it through. The Army has support systems for you to be able to cope.|`|2VsmOU7zaa	He can get deployed as soon as he gets to his new unit at your first duty station, after he gets you settled in housing. My husband has been deployed to Iraq 4 times already. Welcome to military life darlin.They usually get between 8 months to 1 year between deployments. He can deploy at any time.
N20xNbOyaa	Your underlying message that people should treat animals with respect makes sense to me.    The rest of it is a bunch of hogwash.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I think some animals are more intelligent than some humans.  It is absurd to think we are so superior that we have all the rights.  Truthfully, bacteria is more intelligent than we are.|`|WhlwZeiXaa	yes  i get annoyed when christians say, "humans are superior beings because they are smarter, therefore humans have souls and animals dont"|`|rKt2UNI3aa	Animals aren't equal to humans, but that doesn't mean we stop caring about them.

I have lived in such a society.  What is wrong is to mistreat animals for your own pleasure or out of meanness.  Animals should be respected and treated properly.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Based on what Bill Gates did today with the mosquitoes the answer is NO|`|ELT9FldJaa	Animals and humans are equal. I did a research paper on it, animal rights, and animal cruelty.  And they're not even different in intelligence.  Most are just as smart.  And treating animals as if they are lesser and so forth can be used as testers is like saying just because mentally retarded people are lesser so let's test on them. It's not right, and not fair.   Equality for the animals.|`|4TKyMlZcaa	Depends on your views, really.    I mean, I don't consider myself equal to a hamster, you know?  Animals are lowly (in our eyes), they're dirty (in our eyes), and basically, humans have progressed much more than animals in this world and can assume that we're the superior species.    I say nay to your question.|`|z5dpWOidaa	In my opinion, yes. All living things are equal (except moths, because they're scary)|`|VSmQWuhEaa	Animals not of our species are different than us in that they are not of our species, genetically and physically very different. The logic you speak of could easily extend to all life if the definition of "same" was simply broad enough. Now I love my pets, but I love my steak too. Animals kill each other for dominance, fear, and food. We have different relationships with different animals. Now wanton killing without purpose is wasteful, and the jail sentence granted the mail man who killed pets is probably a little light. But the affected families are free to sue him for the apparent value of the animal (in sentimental value as well). But other life forms live together with us in an ecosystem. Some of them are friends, some of them are food, and some of them are predators. That is the order of life on earth.|`|Gbwiwkauaa	The human animal place themselves over all other creatures on the planet. They are often selfish and cruel. "It's just an animal!" It's a dog, who cares?" "Boil that lobster or chicken alive - so, I have to eat. I don't care as long as it's not me who suffers."     There should be harsh penalties for animal cruelty.  The media likes to cover stories about pit bull attacks.  Why don't they report on what made the dogs mean? What did the owner's do to them? Dog fights? Why don't we hear when animals are beaten, left out side in below zero temperatures or the extreme heat of summer with little food or water? I heard a story about a man who sewed the mouth of a beagle shut to stop it from barking.    Johnnybo - I don't see this as a religious issue. We should respect the lives of the other creatures we share this planet with.|`|e7uUfLsqaa	I agree with you.  I cherish all living things :)|`|1mtjvp6aaa	The lord gave man eternal life not the animals.  Genesis 5:1  This is the book of the generations of Adam.

Is it a deal?|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Their divisive issues; but their reasons are class and money    with regard to abortion at least; since rich girls and the girlfriends of rich boys had safe abortions prior to R vs. W; and women who didn't have them, and didn't marry the willing father could be put away for life in an insane asylum

9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	I believe the Republican plan will work far better - and past experience appears to bear this out.    Republicans didn't honor their own principles when they were in power - spending far too much money, for one thing.    But the Democrat plan is far worse.  And I'm not about to hurt myself, or the US economy, just to spite the Republicans.|`|3M6GuYOzaa	and what is "growing" the way out? giving iraq money? what?|`|IG8s8UnSaa	Both cost excessive amounts of money.  Anyone with common sense knows that you can't spend money that you don't have.|`|VWLCwLNMaa	Trickle down economics, during the age of globalism, has resulted in our importing everything. Now not only do we import oil, we import everything. And we don't have anything to export.     We keep thinking that we're an independent nation and that simply isn't true anymore. So neither belief will work unless we come to grips with globalism.    I'd like to understand how the republicans believe that we can grow our way out of a recession, when our work force has to compete with the cheapest labor on earth.     I'd like to understand how the democrats believe that we can spend our way out of a recession when everything we purchase is imported.  And the republicans won't allow a "Made in America" provision in the stimulus plan.    Everyone continues to think of the US economy. And it doesn't exist anymore. We are now a part of the global economy. Therefore, we are no longer an independent nation. And can neither grow nor spend our way out of a recession without paying to pull the entire world out of this global recession.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	"Growing your way out of a recession"?  Who are you trying to BS?  The Bush tax cuts to the rich did almost nothing to stimulate the economy as we can see by the situation we now face.  face it Republicans, 8 years of Reagan, 4 years of Bush Sr. and the last 8 years of Bush Jr have only proven that trickle down economics are a complete and utter failure.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	You have to grow your way out of it.  Excessive government spending simply doesn't work.  It has been tried again and again..|`|V03nUMXBaa	hmm..I remember after 9-11, Bush telling everyone to 'keep spending'.  Look where that got us!!!    Interesting that the government has been spending in deficit since the beginning.  For the last 8 years, including those 6 years of GOP "cut taxes and spend less" Republicans controlled both houses of Congress and the Presidency, caused the largest INCREASE in the national debt since 1949.

Economies are cyclical, and while tax cuts or spending may influence the economy, they will not prevent a recession.    What I also believe is that it is irresponsible... no, it is immoral to pass on our debt to the next generation.  Therefore, I will agree with any policy that balances the books at the end of the day.  Unfortunately, this is not happening in Washington DC right now.|`|P6mFENRYaa	Reagan inherited a recession and he cut taxes and grew the country out of it.

axHyoVqGaa	Is this a bad thing?    No, it isn't bad to be interested in politics and it is even commendable if you want to get into politics for the right reasons.  However, I will warn you that politics can tend to make you cynical and it can have a corrupting influence on people.      Do you think it's bad that i'm 13 and don't know what i want to be when i'm older yet?    No, it don't think it's bad.  Your only 13.  However, you should start giving some thought as to what you would like to do with your future.  Unless things have changed drastically since I was in school, the time is coming when you will have to start choosing what courses you want to take in high school and this can have an effect on what type of school you go to after high school.  For instance, my brother choose to take vocation technical classes and after high school he went on to a trades school.  My other brother took college preparatory classes and after high school, he went on to college.  One bit of advice that I would give you, is to choose something that makes you happy, not something that pays well.  Having to work at a job you don't like can really make your life miserable, regardless of what the pay is.  If you love your job, waking up and dragging yourself off to work becomes much easier!|`|xo4iux9gaa	I think you need to be spanked.|`|VIhj7ghUaa	The term political "science" is one of those oxymorons.

I hope they will take all the pork and nonsense out and turn it in to something that will actually stimulate the economy.    I think what you are asking is: do you love your country more than you dislike Obama's presidency, and the answer is yes.  I love my country more.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	No. They should only pass it if it isn't a load of bull.

WCkOUF9aaa	Thats not the only lobbyist either.    Not much has "changed" has it?    WASHINGTON  Tom Daschle's rise to the helm of the Senate spotlights an awkward fact of life for Washington's power couples: When professional lives intertwine, ethical conflicts can follow.    The South Dakota Democrat's wife, Linda, is a lobbyist who mostly represents airlines, aircraft makers and other aviation-related interests  all of which have a steady stream of issues before the Senate. As majority leader, Tom Daschle has the power to set the Senate's agenda.    Linda Daschle says she will deal with that potential pitfall the way she has since she resumed her lobbying career in 1997: by never lobbying her husband or any member or committee of the Senate. "With dual careers in public policy, you need to be careful and take steps to avoid any appearance problem," she says. "I feel very comfortable with my activities."|`|7h5zhoJqaa	I seem to have missed his name on the Senate Lobbying Disclosure Act Database.  Yep, it's not there to be found, as he's not a lobbyist.  Obama has issued two waivers to people connected with lobbying activities related to the department in which they're serving, and one of those waivers was done at the request of Republican Secy of Defense Robert Gates.      It's pretty difficult to fill a competent staff of experienced people without having some people who were involved in lobbying.  It's been the Washington culture for a century.  But let's just ignore the fact that the VAST MAJORITY of his team is above the fray, which is completely different from past administrations that have been littered with lobbyists.  Let's just focus on a few people who have ties to Washington lobbyists, and a couple who needed waivers.    That's the political hack way!  Distort the facts to paint the picture the way you want to see it.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	he lied,no surprise.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	He "changed" his mind.|`|LydL7EN6aa	look at that! another lie!|`|ByVkqiSCaa	i dont think he promised "no former lobbyists," more that he wanted to keep the current big lobbies out of washington.  you guys are ridiculous.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Obviously he was lying.|`|Gwi2lCQHaa	He lied, no big surprise..|`|3M6GuYOzaa	he was never a lobbyist, try again.|`|r6bEJNlyaa	He was hoping you didn't find out about that.|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	typical lib behavior aka lying|`|b57ca6a213f670d2f4c464725b3fb119aa	Oh come on man.

A more reasonable choice, R Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, is opposing him.    If Palin can't pull off a victory in Texas, she is doomed as a political figure.  Smart handling - give her credit.

Even after it's been proven you're wrong every which way possible, you just smear, smear, smear those you disagree with and try to disparage their views.  I think that you see one mildly-coherent snippet in support of free market capitalism for every fifty snotty comments about "socialism" up here.  None of these yahoos know the difference between communism and socialism, or facism and democracy, for that matter.    You can't defend yourself, so why not just launch into attacks against someone else instead?    It's "evil..." Do people think Jesus would have liked screwing the poor over in favor of the gluttony of the wealthy, and letting greed dominate the most powerful nation on earth?

It's called freedom, and that includes financial freedom. Yes, that makes some people very rich and some people very poor. But it also gives you the freedom to know you have unlimited monetary potential and can dream big.    Socialism deprives people of dreams and innovation. If you want that type of government, please leave the U.S.|`|6eiIyvUkaa	I love how every wrong in the world is the Republican Party's fault. A big portion of the blame for this crisis can be laid on our friends at the SEC. If you don't know what that stands for, yet you have any opinion at all on this whole financial situation, you are a follower. Go learn something, and form your own opinion.    If capitalism doesn't work, how did it make the US the most powerful, and, until recently, the most respected country in the whole world, in such a short amount of time?    Capitalism is also what is going to make electric cars "cool" looking, and efficient. Tesla Roadster, anyone?     And how come if I want to work 12 hours a day and accumulate wealth, why shouldn't that be my right?|`|yDJQrUpZaa	We are tired of subsidizing lazy welfare blacks to sit on their asses, pop out more children and drink 40s.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	Better check out some of your facts.      CLAIM:  Deregulation is a fundamental cause of the crisis and Republicans pushed that deregulation on the country.    REALITY:  Republicans fought for additional oversight and regulation of FannieMae and FreddieMac, but were opposed by (among others) Barney Frank who said there was "no problem".    So, yes there was greed and selfishness.  But it was both by Wall Streed AND the GSE managers that were paying themselves MILLIONS of dollars with bogus accounting.    Corruption, greed and selfishness are human flaws...vices...and are not directly related to capitalism.  Check out China.  You see less selfishness, greed and corruption in a socialist country?    Private ownership, and the right to profit from one's labor, are cornerstones of America...not capitalism...and are not compatible with socialism.|`|GJJw2wszaa	Republicans don't even know what socialism is.  Capitalism puts profit over the welfare of its people. Socialism puts the welfare of its people over profit.    Capitalism is good for the private sector.  Entrepreneurship to big Business. Capitalism should only play a role in the luxury goods and services.    But services such as the  education, judicial, police , fire department, health care  services and medicines should not be rationed  to individuals depending on their race, age, gender, religion or account balance. These services are rights and matter of equal quality of life issues. Profit shouldn't enter and dilute the level of these services. They are not luxury but necessities. Otherwise the level of freedom, justice, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness are themselves which each individual claims the U.S. Provides is it self not immune from being soled for profit.|`|0hncNSXlaa	well seeing as i deal with socialized health care in the army if the rest of socialism sucks this bad then count me out and trust me the average american will not want socialized health care if they get it and alot of the great doctors in the US will leave and people wanting to be doctors from other countries will stop coming here|`|9EdJHqKHaa	People need to get a clue. There will ALWAYS be social stratification. In countries where there is socialism and communism there is actually a greater income stratification then in capitalist countries. Capitalism allows people to earn what they put into something.  It is our right to own Capital. FOR THE RECORD, REPUBLICANS ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES AGAINST TOTAL SOCIALISM. I personally believe socialize healthcare is a great idea, but as far as a completely socialized economy, ABSOLUTELY NOT. There are some things that should be socialized, but NOT EVERYTHING.     DO YOU EVEN UNDERSTAND SOCIALISM AND CAPITALISM? Of course you don't. Learn their real meaning before you criticize.|`|c4b57b3534465ec39ec8b5c38862f872aa	They believe in free enterprise in its truest sense.  Bush wanted to privatize Social Security.

First of all, Capitilism is great. Look at Iceland, they are socialists and they are completly bankrupt. Second of all, i hate to break this to you, but Republicans have done a lot of evil and bad things, yes, but do you honestly think the Republican party fueled all this?

The current crisis was caused by all sides making many mistakes...but to advocate scrapping everything is equivalent to killing the patient rather than curing the disease.    It's difficult to "condemn" something so vague as the word "socialism."    If you mean the system that works well in small, homogeneous countries like Sweeden and Norway...you need to look no further than not-so-homogeneous, but they-really-want-to-be countries like England, France and Germany to see how fragile they actually are.    If you mean the systems put into place by FDR, keep in mind that workers then were happy to earn enough for a hot meal and shoes for their kids...Today, you're looking at billions of dollars just in benefits before one worker completes one job.    If you mean cultural controls like mandatory National Service and Standardized Testing where the State gets to determine who goes to college and who goes to refrigerator repair school.....well, good luck selling that one to the young idealists in their Chinese made Che T-Shirts...

A good starting point is the notion that government should do what can't be done by the people or private enterprise on its own. The further the depths of government intervenes in the lives of its people the more oppressive and unresponsive it becomes. The danger is the lose of personal liberty, fundamental human rights and the erosion of the constitution itself. When the people submit the obligations of self determination to the government they are no longer free and they no longer are masters of their own destiny. You can say you heard it here....Socialism in its purest form is simply anti-American.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Because they think socialism means "run by a dictator" because that is how anarcho-capitalists have painted it.  Anarcho-capitalists want all people to think socialism means everyone gets the same wealth and is limited to that level of wealth, just like they want people to believe about any other system that isn't anarcho-capitalism, that they try ot sell as free-market economics.    The problem stems from the fact that right-wingers really aren't clear on what type of politics they support, because the right-wing pundits, propaganda jockeys and media try to label everything that is viewed as good as conservatism, while everything that may be viewed as offensive as liberalism, regardless of what side of the spectrum it lies.  It is the religious mentality..... to create a devil to blame.      Socialist countries don't take long to fall, because it isn't long before a capitalist nation has them in an endless conflict until they collapse due to military spending.    i guess some of these people still fai to accept the reality of our own economic conditions.|`|otYOxmnuaa	haha -- Barney Frank and company are at the heart of this financial crisis guy.

In this situation, people screwed up and the government is taking OUR money to let them try again!      Socialism is a system doomed to failure in a democratic society.  It keeps people from striving or trying to better themselves.  No one wants to be the guy who tries hard and succeeds when they will have to turn around and give the extra to people who didn't try as hard so that it is all "fair."  F*ck fair!

Coming at this from a different perspective, any society - whether socialist or capitalist is going to have its privileged elites.  I happen to think that capitalists have better table manners.|`|ZvU093GPaa	speaking as a republican it is not that we condemn socialism it just that we look at it and see its flaws.  Because socialism is a fast track to a dictatorship. And if you study your American history that is what our founding fathers  fought the British for so they could create this great nation of ours. sure there are some aspects of socialism that seem like good ideas on paper but in practice they just do not work very well. After all the best form of government  on paper is the doctrine written by Marx when he originally  wrote the out line of Communism. If it wear fallowed the way he wrote it no one would own anything and there would be no economical classes. but then when you figure in the human equation to dominate others guess what in practice it dose not work. proof of this is in the history books look at the rise and fall of the soviet union.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	I do not believe Republicans, who really want to conserve our tax dollars for their elite constituents benefits, know the difference between Marxism, Socialism or Communism and a Fair and Responsible Government utilizing its resources for things like Social Security, which is really an insurance paid for by the taxpayers; unemployment benefits, which are really an insurance paid for by the employer and governments jointly with the employees actual wages and taxes paid by the employee, too; and other programs are funded jointly by the taxpayers-- for times like when we file a claim with an auto insurance after we have an accident.

oEfnqmp3aa	Noticing? The only reason we turn a blind eye to them is because of how uncomfortable the fact of the situation is. It's not unnoticed, but ignored.    The thinking that goes behind ignoring them is in the range of being unable to help them. They'd have to ultimately get a lot of money to get out of such a life, and in most people's perspective, giving that much would then hinder their own lives.

But practically all the people in Africa live on the ground, in a war between the Tutsi's and the Hutu's, every night the Tutsi children there are afraid of being captured, they live in the shadows, and those who are captured are forced to kill at an age even as low as 6, sometimes they are forced to kill their own families.  Europe came into Africa and used Imperialism (taking over another country, and claiming it is 'your burden to help them) and put the Tutsi tribe higher up on the 'food chain' (15% of the African's were the Tutsi tribe) and the Hutu tribe (~80%) were forced slaves and 'inferiors' to the Tutsi's. Now when Europe left, the Hutu's overcame the Tutsi's and they have been at war since, with mass bloodshed and chaos.    before we deal with the children who have poor living conditions in the US, we need to help the children who don't have any living conditions in Africa.|`|6ZiIw4ugaa	I would say it would look pretty noticeable when it reaches 100% of the population is poor.|`|31fDBuLjaa	There are varying definitions of poor.

e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	Yes, we are on the verge of the New Deal 2. And we all know the first one significantly grew government while eroding individual freedom, free market economics, and federalism.    As Rahm Emanuel says "Never allow a crisis to go to waste!" That has always been the mantra of big government loving hacks as a way to increase government power and size. It happens with any and all tragedies. The Great Depression, the Civil War, WWII, 9-11, this current economic downturn. Even in my home state when the I-35W bridge collapsed, the democrats were all over it as a means to advance their agenda. We like to call the democrats motto here in MN as "Leave no tragedy behind" because they'll politicize anything for political gain.    That's also how people like Adolf Hitler rose to power.|`|bhOn6uWQaa	The governent has changed since the Constitution was adopted, most certainly.     Our government is lawless.

Em88Qn3Oaa	A police report is just that, A report.    If you want charges filed you must request that and file a warrant. They will do an investigation and file the appropriate charges then.    If you file a report there is no investigation becuase you dont want to press charges and it would be a waste of time.    Warrant= arrest  Report= on file|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	No, a police report of a complaint/incident is filed without action taken, but filing charges means that they will arrest that party and take them in for legal proceedings.|`|AA11622716	Making a report to police is not the same as filing charges.  Only a prosecutor can decide to use taxpayer money to seek a criminal conviction.  If police have not acted on your report there could be many reason for that.  The primary reason is if you told police that you did not desire a criminal prosecution but instead wanted to get your money back.  Getting your money is a civil matter, not a police matter, and it is at your expense, not the taxpayer's expense.  If you want to know what you might do now to encourage the police to investigate and encourage the prosecutor to prosecute, ask that.|`|vFvI16P7aa	It depends on the prosecuting attorney.  In my state, if you gave someone who committed a criminal act against you the chance to "pay you back" or you will follow through with prosecution, you have changed what was criminal to a now-civil matter.  And officers don't determine restitution, a judge may or may not order it.  You maybe even still have to take her to small claims court.  If you want to prosecute, you'd better call that officer immediately and see if they will still take it to the prosecuting attorney.  If this is a misdemeanor, your statute of limitations is probably about to expire (usually 1 year).|`|vRp9AqnNaa	no, all a police report does is put it on record of what happend in case they have to look at the previous history, when you file charges you are pressing charges on that person and you go to court or they get arrested.|`|659f1f810e91bd90e89b9598970c5d20aa	No...They are different...You file a police report for them to do an investigation.

It sad how many use the system.     I volunteer my spare time in talking with Soldiers who have or claim to have PTSD. Usually, as a military serviceman who has been down range, you can pick out the ones "claiming" to have suffered. Had one guy in the group with an ARCENT patch tell me he was suffering from PTSD.

Plain fact is that some people are quite traumatized by what they saw or did and others - the vast majority, do just fine.  The same is true of police, firefighter and other jobs where you get exposed to stuff that most people never see of even contemplate.      Nothing new; as far back as the civil war there is documentation of people having what today we would refer to PTSD.  While we may be more aware of it now it has happened for generations and people survived and functioned because they had to if they wanted to eat.  Perhaps in some ways being forced to function had the therapeutic effect - I can't say, but it had been that way from the first time a caveman saw a friend or relative eaten by a dinosaur.

This is a package designed to create jobs, which will get our economy rolling again and which will create a broader tax base. It is also taking into consideration the health of our citizens and environment, local economies, and long-term benefits. Did you know that the arts, as a whole, employs almost six million people? So a financial push for the National Endowment for the Arts - an organization seasoned in rolling money into the economy - makes a little more sense in light of that, doesn't it? Ask the thousands of salmon fishermen who are out of work because of the alarming collapse of salmon populations if some of the stimulus package could be a help to them.     The Republican answer to getting the economy back on its feet is more tax cuts. That is ridiculously short-sighted. This is an opportunity to reinvent our economic base with things that are sustainable and good for the entire country and world. And Repubs want tax cuts instead, claiming that debased trickle-down economics is the way to go. Trickle-down doesn't work.

That's as it should be.  The separation of church and state is the reason.  They don't pay taxes and the government doesn't hand them money.

AA12157171	Other than in immediate living quarters (tent, dorms, trailers) you must be in Uniform. EIther combat uniform (ACU, ABU, ETC) or PT gear authorized for your branch. Civilian clothing are not authorized.    This is not a thing that is different from branch to branch. This is a CENTCOM mandated policy. It is non negotiable, and units that don't follow it are violating CENTCOM rules.    From airforce reg:  "This new policy went into effect June 10 and applies to all CENTCOM locations."    From Army Reg:  http://community.armystudyguide.com/grou...    "MNF-I UNIFORM WEAR, APPEARANCE, CONDUCT AND STANDARDS    R.1. GENERAL  1. Purpose. This policy establishes standards for uniform wear, appearance, and conduct for personnel assigned, attached, TACON, OPCON, ADCON, or TDY to Iraq and/or Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I).   2.

In 2006 and 2007 i had to wear uniform all of the time, and when i wasnt inside of a building i had to wear full gear.. helmet, flak jacket(vest). because we constantly took mortars, and daily ambushes from insurgents! in 2008 iraq cooled down alot and we were allowed to walk around in our PT gear when we went to the gym, regular uniform everywhere else, and full gear on patrols!!! but no civilian clothes!!! but who knows, it may be different now from when i was there!!!|`|QdzecSwdaa	When you are on duty, you are obviously going to wear your uniform.  I don't have any days of while I am deployed, but off duty I wear whatever I want, which usually consists of gym shorts and T-shirts during summer, and a hoody or fleece during winter months. I own PT gear, but its without a doubt the worst money spend by any branch of the armed forces.....its useless.  Depends on your unit, if your lucky enough, you won't ever have to touch your PT gear except when in like the UAE or Qatar on your in and out of theater    Depends where your husbands at and how gay his chain of command wants to be.  he can where whatever he wants in his tent/room, just might be able to go outside in it.
AA11312653	Maria, that is just nursing jargon meaning that she reminded you to use condoms for everything. She is probably required by law to educate every person she treats about safe sex and will get in trouble if she doesn't chart that she educated you. It doesn't imply that you did something wrong or that you didn't already know about condoms. You are upset and seeing people as being against. That is understandable because you have been badly hurt. Call 2-1-1 or your county's rape crisis center or the public health clinic and ask to speak to someone anonymously about a rape. There are people who will listen to you and treat you with the respect and dignity you deserve. I am so sorry this happened to you.|`|DenLZAL1aa	Please report it.

1KGXts5Daa	I had a similar response from the psychologist who performed my evaluation for public safety (fire department) employment almost 20 years ago.  Since then I have had opportunities to learn more about the process, and tactics used.    Yes, this is absolutely a tactic employed during a psych eval to see what your response will be to a confrontation.      Think about it.  You want a career in law enforcement.  The psych hits you with that statement.  Are you going to:   blow up in anger and aggression?    turn red in the face and feel embarrassed?    "sweet talk", or offer the psych something to not "reveal" his findings?    go blank and give the "thousand yard stare"?    Now apply all those alternatives (plus all the other ones you can imagine) to your future career in law enforcement.  Do you think there are going to occasions where you are going to be challenged by someone, or face confrontation?  Just about every day?    Do you think that the psych was using that opportunity then to evaluate how you, in the role of LE officer, might likely respond in such a future circumstance?  You bet.    That psychologist was doing the right thing, and has obviously done a few public safety officer candidate psych evaluations in the past.    It took me quite a while to look at that one component of the background investigation and hiring process - not from the perspective of the candidate - from a much broader perspective, namely: What kind of personality do we want to be hiring to serve as our law enforcement and fire/rescue professionals?  (if you ever give serious study to "hazard/risk analysis and public liability" that last statement will take on an even deeper meaning)    I trust that your response showed how open and honest you are; how "in check" your emotions are; and how psychologically mature you are.      Those are qualities we want in our public safety professionals.  Best of luck in your career!|`|3yXhtBSxaa	The pause is used by law enforcement, psychologists, lawyers, etc, quite often to test someone's behavior, honesty, and things of that nature.|`|DenLZAL1aa	this a tactic that is often used to test somebody's response|`|4t2kd03Waa	You should know that most shrinks have their own issues to deal with and that is the reason they entered that wacky field to begin with.  They wanted to know how to solve their own shortcomings.    I wouldn't sweat it too much since you have already passed the oral and the polygraph.  In my opinion those that were a little on the wild side growing up and not criminal in their behavior make the best police officers.  To me those that grew up doing nothing make the worst police officers.|`|oo9ZNCTTaa	The pause in the questioning is to Open up the opportunity to speak for yourself.  As well, it is also used to rate your honesty and integrity with regards to what is being questioned.   As for checking for your response it is probable, but not necessarily true. In other words, it may have been a "trick " statement to test your anger levels or your thinking patterns. Your response-time to the question probably was a "check" on your impulsivity.   I wouldn't be overly concerned as you are quite correct when you said that if it were a concern, you would not have been so far along in the hiring process.|`|GsqQ4UTnaa	Psychologist try to get reactions from you. I wouldn't sweat it. When I met the psychologists he was almost insulting me because of my mediocre grades in college. I just laughed and told him "B's and C's make degrees."

Peace|`|AA11614944	I do not listen to Rush but would echo another answer. I hear so many liberals repeat the vile driver emanating from stephanie miller, schultz, rhoedes, etc. Whether you listen to it or not, there are many many liberals who get their marching orders from miller and the other mouthpieces.  I used to like to laugh at the hypocrisy on the liberal talk shows, alas, where I live, the station that the drivel used to be on was changed over to a Catholic station with religious programming, evidently it was more profitable that the inane liberal talk.|`|ulzWumWPaa	This joke of an election cycle with that worn out old liberal in a republican colored coat, McCain, was a deliberate sabotage of the Republican party in action, history and principle. I knew as soon as McCain was 'chosen' for the ticket, it was all over. His abysmal record as a 'moderate' was a joke. He's been 'across the isle' so many times he can't find his way back.

This election cycle we had the media go to be with Obama and never ask him a tough question.    Yet when one guys does you found in your heart to seek into private government records to smear the poor guy.    I like the Bill Rights and we should all be free to say what we want to say in this country.

The Leadership of the Senate and House of Representatives is currently working with President Barack Obama to determine the best way to stabilize our struggling economy. I hope that an economic recovery bill will focus on the creation of new jobs, and tangible, well-targeted investments in infrastructure, especially because California's unemployment rate has increased to over eight percent.      The Senate and House of Representatives are likely to try to work quickly so that an economic recovery bill can be ready for President Obama to sign into law as soon as possible. Please know that I will keep your comments and suggestions in mind as Congress considers further options to stimulate the economy.      Once again, thank you for writing.

vFvI16P7aa	The biggest thing about a relationship with a LEO is understanding.  We work weird, ridiculous, long hours, overtime, and holidays.  Many spouses want to hear about our day, but we just want to forget our day and that ensues into an argument because the spouse feels that they are being left out and the other is not talking to them.  I'm a little different, since I (female) am the LEO, but it goes both ways.  My husband worries about me getting hurt.  He doesn't like the cop get togethers because all they talk about is cop stuff and it gets boring.  He hates the hours.  He hates the mindset of some police officers.  It's like LEO's have a whole separate family and spouses sometimes feel that they aren't included.  Understanding is the best advice I can give.  Most veteran cops (been on the street for a while) have learned to separate work from home, which helps tremendously, but the spouse must be understanding about all the mental and physical crap we deal with every day.|`|0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	I agree with Lov4...she states it very well!
cbf7a1df79c8809b6678b88d7a4f714baa	India is supporting srilanka mainly because of the ruling congress party's revenge for late rajiv gandhi's assassination.     Indian govt is also putting false information about LTTE all over the media in north India. The above two friends who have answered have got no knowledge about the srilankan issue.     Firstly how can a bunch of two thousand LTTEs control three hundred thousand people at gun point. have some common sense.    Secondly, if LTTE controled 300,000 srilankans Sinhalese at gunpoint, will the srilankan military shell 5000 missiles everyday? they won't. Just because it is Tamil civilians, SLA kills thousands of  innocent civilians everyday. Srilankan army kidnaps many young men and women from the camps each day and kill them and rape them before they bury the bodies in the farmlands.     Srilankan govt is the worst ever genocidal military govt ever present in the whole world, worse than the Hitler's govt. It is the most brutal, cruel and autocratic govt ever this world witnessed.     It is a shame that this merciless govt is supported by the Indian govt which is by and large became a genocidal govt. For this reason Tamil people are condemning Indian govt. However north Indians and brahmin community support this bloody war waged by the Indian govt to kill thousands of Tamils. India is solely responsible for this massacre.  India has worsen the situation in srilanka by supporting SLA in the war. India has to answer for every killing there.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	We are all sympathisers of the cause of the civilian Tamils but at the same time don't you agree that we should all condemn the LTTE which is holding the civilian population as hostages and human shields in its  war with the Sri Lankan government?And all for satisfying the ego of one criminal individual,V.Prabhakaran.Come on now,let's hear you raise your voice against the LTTE and its Chief,Velupillai Prabhakaran.  Do you have the guts to condemn him leave alone fight against him?  You should understand that India is helping Sri Lanka fight a terrorist  organisation which has been branded as such by the world community.  Are you even aware of the thousands of innocent people that the LTTE  and its bosses have massacred mercilessly?Do you even know what   genocide means?What the LTTE does is worse than genocide.It is plain brutal murder.|`|5KaDHt5jaa	Okay, first:  adding a letter to the end of a noun does not automatically transform it into a verb.  Second, you must not really pay much attention to the situation in Sri Lanka.  If you did, you would know that the Tamil Tigers hold the Tamil civilians at gunpoint for use as hostages to prevent strikes by the military.  The only reason there is such a thing as a Tamil Tiger left is because Sri Lanka is trying to avoid civilian casualties.  Otherwise, they would have been killed off long ago.

The group which is the oldest and most organized group that I know of is:    http://www.oas.org/    There are also groups dreaming of a Latin American Union who listen to talk of the North American Union with horror because it includes Mexico.

FKJaQXQLaa	Boot camp isnt fun.  It isnt supposed to be.  Once you get out and get to your duty assignment, it is pretty much like any other job.  You have to get a haircut every week.  You have the choice of a high and tight, high reg, medium reg, or low reg.  When I was in it cost us about $2 for a hair cut.  Not sure what it costs now.  Marine Corps chow halls leave something to be desired.  At least ours did in the Stumps.  That is why they have BK and Mickey Ds.  Get yourself a car when you get to your duty station and you are good as gold.  The seargent was right in how you are treated.  If you take the initiative to get things done and do them without being told to, you will be just fine.  Your superiors will know they can count on you and you will get lots of respect.  If, on the other hand, you are constantly being told to do things, and need constant supervision to do them, then you will be getting every s@ t detail that comes up.  The Marine Corps is not looking for robots, just some people with some brains and maturity.|`|esOaJoqBaa	Life in the Corps if tough, the rules are fairly strict and it is a lot of work. That said it is also a very rewarding job. If you have it in you to be the best in your chosen field, then the Marine Corps is a good choice, but it is not easy. Excellence never is.    In the Marine Corps you get treated in a manner befitting your behavior, proficiency and maturity. If you are good at your job and respect your superiors then they will show you the respect befitting your rank and billet. If you suck then you will get treated as such.|`|vKxt1i0Faa	Well I'm guessing when your at your duty station. You can already imagine what happens in boot camp.    In the duty station, you do your job then when they are off they just drink, try to get laid, get laid, drink some more and get bored. Haircuts are every week. Marines living quality is s h i t . Bad food, bad everything unless you are hopefully stationed in California. Anywhere else sucks balls.|`|jHUAfrojaa	I know you said only Marines, but I know a lot on this considering my boyfriend is a Marine.    So basically this is all he does,  He wakes up, PT's, goes to class/work, eats, back to class/work, then formation, dismissed, does what he cans.  Sometimes he will work out, sometimes he will just relax.  My boyfriend basically only eats at chow because he is trying to buff up, but they do have a mini store you can buy food for snacks. How they treat you depends on the DI's. My boyfriend has had some pretty bad *** DI's who let them do pretty much what they want, within rules.    It is an experience I am happy my boyfriend is doing because it gives you discipline you could never really get.|`|JDxpjT34aa	First off...Marines are not soldiers. People in the army are called soldiers. People in the Marine Corps are called Marines! What you do will depend on your MOS (job) and how you get treated will depend a lot on your superior and how you act. In boot camp you eat at the chow hall. After that you can eat wherever you want but the chow hall will be accessible to you. You'll have to get a regulation haircut every week, in boot camp you're head will get shaved (obviously that only pertains to males). In boot camp you go through a lot of "classes" and do a lot of drill and PT and go to the rifle range and do mcmap etc. etc. You'll have to qualify at the rifle range and pass the PFT (3 mile run, pull-ups and crunches).|`|rx7e4Jogaa	They will treat you harshly, they'll yell, scream, and demand perfection, however they won't curse or hit you.  You pretty much eat crap, but it'll be good for you.  Your hair cut will be a completely shaved head.

In addition they represent the richest 10% America, who own 90% of America.    Plus politics is just part of the country, just look at how they give power away to the military and police.    Do you know that in every instance (I know of at least) the Sheriff is second only top the Country Executive, and the military's conflicts with liberal democrats is legendary.    They don't need us giving power away to them, but when you add thier power rto the power of democrates, especally those not just interested in alieving white guilt without making any real changes, thiers no contest.|`|EPqnB7Epaa	So you are saying that once a party is down they are permanently down?

As far as the stigma of being rich & racially intollerent in many ways that's all it is is a stigma. You think that everybody that voted for Obama likes African Americans. You must not know much about the people that voted for Obama. Many of them were voting against what they believed would be another term much like George Bush's. And it had nothing to do with race. And rich come on who's a** has your head been up? Most of those rich Republicans that you'll spoke of in the 80's are dead or on life support. Most of the rich now a days are in the entertainment business & think the 60's & 70's rocked. And things like abortion, fornication, divorce, adultry,  homosexuality & drugs are cool. Don't get me wrong i don't agree with the Republicans on a lot of issues as well. But i dislike when both sides think their party is awesome & has no faults. If you think hand outs will fix the economy i'd hate to see what your kids look like if you have any. Are they still popping by asking daddy for an extra 20 bucks & living in the home & bailing them out of jail? Or did you teach them to stand up for themselves & take responsiblity for their actions? That's why so many of you Dems will always be for abortion you wouldn't know how to be responsible for your actions if you tried.|`|e2e2ccd6c15e732cbfc8b82485ecb4ebaa	Yes he can!|`|avWArdYbaa	GOP - party of the rich, and the racially intolerant?

It's mind boggling that they refuse to lift a finger to get us out.|`|otYOxmnuaa	Because it's spending for the sake of spending -- 2/3 of it doesn't create anything -- and doesn't require any labor.    I hate to break it to you but Obama sounded like a tool trying to justify his bill by saying  "That's what stimulus is -- spending".     Well, yah, unless of course the type of spending you're doing doesn't require any labor or is kept w/in the government agencies.  That type of spending doesn't do anything but increase the power and reach w/in government.  And if there are some jobs created -- they aren't in the free-market...more bureaucracy, more big-brother.      This bill is nothing more than budgetary spending cloaked in "stimulus" -- they're trying to pass it under the radar in urgency and when all is said and done -- the Dems will have secured their spending for the next 4 years.  It's reckless.    By the way -- Obama also said during the Super Bowl interview w/ Lauer that he'd reduce the size of the bill -- it's grown 50 billion dollars this week.  What happened?    If history has taught us anything it's that the bigger the government becomes, the less freedoms its citizens retain.    Our founding fathers fought against big government...and here we are...G-dubs and Obama taking our progress back 200 years.  ______________________________________...  The wise:  Check this link -- this is what REAL economists say about the plan -- not Obama's pocket men.  Try to distinguish between the different strategies past Presidents have used -- take notice of the ones that succeeded...and those that failed, then ask yourself if it's time to experiment -- w/ 1.3 trillion dollars of taxpayers' money (You, your kids, their kids, and theirs will pay for it):    http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-comm...    Obama's plan calls for deficit-financed spending increase.  FDR tried this in the 30's.  ___________________________________  Actually, Eric C. makes a great point.  It's not complicated at all.  Keep the programs we need -- get rid of the others we can do without (at least for now).  That's reality.  But as we've seen from recent Congressional pay raises, the government doesn't live in the real world.  When they fail, they get raises.  Nice.  ______________________________________...  Ignorance:  "Tax cuts to have never been an economic stimulus...if they were, we wouldn't be in this mess (was that too obvious to say?). The only things Republicans are interested in is getting power back."  1.  Tax cuts in G-dubs years brought in more tax-revenue than clinton's tax hikes...fact.  Generally the cuts cause tax-revenue to fall the first 2 years (which is what you'd expect of lower tax intake) and then as the economy grows b/c people have more money on hand to spend, increase sales revenues and hire new employees -- you open the system up to increases in tax revenue.  Each new employee -- each new purchase -- each boost in production increases tax-revenue.    2.  Republicans can only get power back if their plan works.  Do you think they'd push a plan that would sabotage them?   Check it:  http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-comm...    "They can cater to their biggest financial supporters by advocating tax cuts."  Are there no successful democrats?  Don't be narrow.  Across that board tax-cuts benefit everyone.     "They can demonize the current administration by scaring people with the increased debt (despite the fact they never cared about it for the last 8 years), they can obstruct any form of stimulus since a failure will only help them and they have nothing to lose."    Unless of course the plan works -- then they bury themselves in failure.  They believe it won't work -- and if you've read the bill and checked the link I provided -- you'd jump on that wagon.  FAILURE.  There's no other way around it.  You can't pit 300 billion direct "stimulus" spread out over 4 years against a GDP of 13 Trillion per annum.  Logistically it doesn't work.      As to bringing bring up G-dubs and his spending spree -- how in the world does that justify spending more?  Is that the "they got to do it now it's our turn" argument?  C'mon man.

What? I have no idea what that even means, but I bet it can be cut.    We need to cut back on our spending, before spending more money.    Tax cuts for business are important, because if a business is hurting for money, and we increase the burden on them, they aren't going to hire more people.    I think a better use of a trillion dollars would be to pay off that massive national debt. Can you even begin to comprehend the BILLIONS of dollars we pay in interest on that!?!??!?!?

If you actually read for yourself what the stimulus package is and where the money is going,  you will see that it DOES NOT STIMULATE anything,  just lines the DEMs with money.  "(The current stimulus bill increases) discretionary domestic spending by 317 Billion dollars that's an 81% increase in discretionary domestic spending in one year and an increase in mandatory spending 308 billion dollars. That's -- 26% increase, the highest in thirty years. Most of that money does not go to anything -- vaguely creates jobs in fact some of the money goes to things that will destroy jobs for example. There's a twenty billion dollar of mandatory program for health information technology. The purpose of having health information technologies that so hospitals and doctors can file for conspire to let go file clerks. Data entry people receptionists and clerks. And you know it we ought to be focused on people who are losing their jobs and figure out ways to get them back to work and stimulate economic growth in the country not to simply go out and spend money."

FZRWMc3Baa	You're missing the point by a mile.  This is supposed to be a "stimulus" package.  While the things you mention are more than worthy, most of them do not belong in a stimulus bill.  Pass a separate bill to fund those things.  A stimulus bill should STIMULATE the economy.  Way too many items in this bill are payback for supporters to help their re-election down the road.

Those responsibilities are supposed to be left up to the state.|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	No.....but considering all those things are generally funded out of EXISTING taxes, I don't find it particularly "simulating" either.    And there's the point. Why was Barney Frank sweating through three layers of Brooks Brothers Tweed?  Because he was praying that fear would get the first bailout bill through before anyone asked the simple question "What happened to the money ALREADY collected?"    Let's say you paid to have a brand new house built...when you moved in, you found out that the whole place was a disaster....shoddy workmanship... exposed wiring ... unfinished work all over ... Of course you would complain.    Now, imagine the builder said "You're right, this is totally unacceptable.  I'm going to build you another house at only 30% over what I charged you for the last one."    "But, why should I have to pay even more to fix your mistakes?"    "Well sir," the contractor says.  "I AM going to have to do the work all over again... I mean, we made a mistake ...  but is that any reason to take the food off our kid's tables?"    Faced with this "logic" would you say "Of course, how silly of me.  Please proceed" ... ?    If you raised no objection to the previous bailout ....  and have raised no objection to the current version of the "stimulus" bill...you basically just did that very thing.|`|mD6Wv0SYaa	I think it's outrageous for anyone to try to say research on STDs is wasting money.

According to repugnantcans, any spending that saves jobs is pork.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	It depends on what it is for.  Spending a bunch of money on air-conditioners for schools when the rest of the school has lead paint peeling off the wall and tattered books would be pork, imho.  Unnecessary road work that never gets done, yet keeps getting funded, is pork.  Bridges that are state of the art, but unsafe because they have no shoulders and only two skinny lanes, (see:  new flyovers by Lambert International Airport in St. Louis) yep, that's pork.    Dog parks, STD Prevention tools, ATV trails--pork, pork, pork.    Paying police officers and firefighters to do their jobs is not pork.    When the Wall Street Journal experts say that less than 12 cents of every dollar in the stimulus package will actually go toward stimulating the economy, you can guarantee that the damn thing is loaded with nasty pork.    Pigs DO fly in Washington.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	If these are necessary expenditures, why didn't the Democrats include them in the 2009 fiscal year spending bills?

There are a lot of things that could use some work, schools, roads, etc.  But the US didn't win the lottery and we don't need to be on a spending spree right now.  We need to fix the problem, the mortgage mess caused the problem.  The banks are falling apart because people are not paying their mortgages.  New schools are nice, but $150,000,000,000 towards new schools and roads will not work to significantly halt foreclosures.    Be honest, how many people do you know, now how many of them work on roads or build schools?  I know thousands of people and have met only 1 engineer involved with road construction, a couple of builders, but only residential.|`|1TJ5v6Xzaa	If the spending goes to the right things in those schools, roads, bridges, etc, it wouldn't be pork.  If you look closer to where the spending is actually going to, you'd call it pork too.  You hear spending on schools, but its really money going towards the teacher's unions and salaries, it doesn't fix the schools, nor help the students.  Repubs want spending on bridges and roads to FIX them, not study them for 5 years, everybody knows they need repair.  Repubs wants to hire more police officers, firemens, not give money to their unions, which won't guarantee hiring of more police officers and firemans.    Millions of dollars will go to Amtrak, a company that has been losing money for decades, but it won't make them hire more people, it will just pay off their debts.    None of the provisions in the bill says "Here is a big wad of cash, use it to hire people".  Nope, no restrictions.  When the banks were given the bailout, how many people did they hire?  None.  How many CEOs got bigger bonuses? Lots.  Didn't one of them go to a tropical island retreat? Yes, it was on the news.|`|T8xc1suVaa	Nice theory there but by definition "pork" is something that has nothing to due with the bill being put into it so it avoids debate. Money for std awareness is pork. a dog park in san fransisco is pork.money for the phillipino world war 2 vets is pork. None of these adds stimulus to our economy and are Pork. according to who you listen to anywhere from 12 to 25% of this bill is for stimulus. the rest is just spending without debate.|`|eyE1esR7aa	No, building bridges, spending money on police and fire departments are not pork.  But if you take an honest look at the Stimulus bill passed by the House of Representatives, the bill is full unnecessary spending, political handouts, and frivolous entitlement expenditures. Please enlighten me on how money for sex education actually stimulates the economy? There are some good things in the bill, but the vast majority of the bill should be gutted.  Now for a simple question  why do people who have no idea how to run a business much less make any profit think they can write legislation and that will stimulate the economy?

Competition, both between companies and individuals, is what keeps our economy in motion. While democracy in the purest sense of the word is probably the best solution in small groups, there has to be a person (or persons) that can make quick decisions and oversee the smaller groups. While it's great to have your opinion heard, it's not great when there are so many different opinions that a decision cannot be reached. That said, 'the few' should be the best of the best; able to make wise, quick decisions, and take full responsibility for mistakes.  Without strong leaders, the system begins to fall apart.|`|oYf3jSq6aa	There are many countries that practice the very system you speak of, go there|`|D5tIByciaa	how about the employees leave and start their own company, pay whatever they want and see if they survive?|`|FxHKRs9Faa	You may well have a valid point, one which I won't despute; however, when the government steps into the corporate world, freedom ends and communism begins.    I'd rather be able to plop down an answer to this question and have a lower wage than to have no freedoms at all.    Thanks for a thought provoking question!|`|TxRRITveaa	Ask the Soviet Union how well that system worked out for them.|`|a0ea30926acdfeb82a6d6f9ca13bcc69aa	As far as I know, there aren't any laws to stop a person or group of employees from starting their own business.  They are already free to do that.    I disagree with the idea of taking away the freedoms of anyone to own a business.  If that business is successful, I don't think that we should penalize the owners.    In the US, we aren't forced to work for any particular company.  We have the freedom to choose which companies to work for and we are even free to start our own business whenever we want to take that financial risk.
Jn7bt3JTaa	Yes, The military is filled with men and women who are recruited because they desire the order, repetition and the conformity of rules that a well maintained Military offers.     Many young men and women are escaping chaotic childhoods and covet the idea of of a stable, if not predictable life.     The One thing that is constantly overlooked when discussing military life is while a recruit is committed to the Government, the government is committed to the recruits, soldiers and marines as well. It is a contractual, and faithful obligation, and therefore all that a recruit does and all that the military does to train and provide for its recruits, is MANDATORY.       My opinion is a positive one. My stepfather and Husband both escaped small town, and questionable upbringings to serve in the in the Navy and Marines respectively. Both served honorably, my husband is decorated.     I believe it is a mistake to protest recruiter on Public High school campuses. There just may be a quiet boy or girl who would find their Ideal Lifestyle through such a recruiter.     And as long as a public school accepts federal funds, it is MANDATORY for the school to allow recruiter access to elligible students.|`|DKfScL8taa	there is no similarity besides they both start with an M......
9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	The papers would have been painstakingly put together over a long period by the solicitor and for a case of this kind would probably occupy piles of paperwork. The barrister concerned would burn plenty of midnight oil going through the papers and would probably work with a junior member of the Bar in doing so, as there might be occasions in court when the presence of an extra pair of hands, feet and eyes would be useful and over a lengthy murder hearing there might even be the horror of the barrister losing his voice or being rushed to hospital, in which case the junior would have to take over.  There would be conferences with the solicitor and with the client to consider the strength of the prosecution case, the calling of witnesses and the order in which they should be called and endless other things even before committal of the case to the Central Criminal Court. It is one long, hard slog.    No barrister is going to be briefed in a murder case until he has achieved a good track record as a junior. Contrary to some of the fiction one reads!|`|H4PQ8nsfaa	A murder suspect will first appear at a Magistrates Court which will deal with the initial stages (including any Bail application) but the case will be later transferred to a Crown Court where the suspect will either plead guitly and be sentenced or not guilty and be tried.     In a case like this the suspect will probably have instructed Solicitors at a very early stage in the procedings say on arrest or on being charged.The Solicitors can instruct the Barrister at any point as soon as the Client agrees.In a murder case this may be very early on in the case.It may even involve the Barrister applying for Bail at the Magistrates Court.    Before the full hearing the defence will receive copies of the prosecution evidence and in turn prepare the defendants evidence.In a murder case it is highly likely that the Barrister ( who will present the case in open Court) will be consulted very early on about the evidence The Solicitors job will be to prepare the defence case by interviewing defence witnesses and pass their evidence on to the Barrister for use at trial.|`|CowgOqXTaa	They are retained by the defendants Solicitor.

That does not make me either a republican or a redneck.  It also does not make me a racist.  What it makes me is someone who did not care for the man or his stated policies.  We were not resentful, we were fearful that this man would turn our democracy into a socialist nation.  We were fearful that he would not make decisions that were right for this country.  So far, we are right.

Welfare is a band-aid, and that is all it should be. That is why you can only get CASH ASSISTANCE for three years.    Your statement IS a stereotypical question, no matter what you say. Many Black people are NOT on Welfare, and not everyone who IS on Welfare voted for Obama so they think they can stay on Welfare. Many of the people I helped who are Black believe that, although incorrect, that Obama will bring back jobs SO THEY CAN WORK. They believe, and rightly so, that Republicans protect Corporations and the rich. Take a look at what the Republican politicians want now. They want cuts, but only for Capital Gains and Corporate tax cuts. How many poor and lower Middle-Class people have Capital Gains?    All people who voted want what WE ALL WANT - fair pay for working. Guarantee you that if people picking up trash would get paid for it at a pay that would allow them to survive and save, many would do it in a heartbeat...|`|eGsNFUeiaa	No I would not have voted for him because he wouldn't be a democrat if he did.|`|kB7Wuyknaa	Not that I agree with welfare %100 but a lot of single mom's and kids rely on government programs.  We do need it.  I do agree with having to get a job after a while of being on it, as long as the program provides job training with the understanding that if the recipient doesn't get a job with that training they are cut off immediately.  As far as voting for someone who wants to get rid of welfare and the like...well, that's why I do not vote republican.

The system was reformed by a Democrat, Bill Clinton.  I know people who were on welfare for years & years and are now working.  Before that we had families living their whole lives on welfare, but that's not very common at all now.    I have a distrust of any politician who says he's just going to stop welfare (or any other thing we don't like) and that's that.  Just ending welfare is a simplistic plan, it's not workable, it just -sounds- good.  And politicians never actually do that.  You should be suspicious when you hear promises like that.    Examples:  Reagan promised he'd just abolish the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Education, and a couple others.  Once he got into office he said 'Well, it's complicated'.  Reagan also promised to push through a constitutional amendment to ban abortion, but never really even tried.  GHW Bush tried to end the Food Stamp Program and wasn't -allowed- to!  Not by the weak and poor who get food stamps, but by the big food producers who were used to this big govt. subsidy.  Phil Gramm (I think it was) announced that Congress was going to kill Amtrack, just cancel it, why shouldn't railroads be 100% privatized?  But it was just a campaign promise, he never actually tried.    Social welfare has never been that big a part of the US budget.  Reagan/Bush's S&L debacle cost us more than all the welfare we've paid out since welfare began.  Bush's stimulus package was even more than that (and that we before Obama's stimulus package!)  Corporate welfare is 8-9 times bigger than social welfare, but you don't see Democrats promising to end that either, do you?|`|b32jC7pGaa	Sounds like you are supporting the idea of make-work jobs.

And does this everyone include, disabled people or senior citizens who have already worked all their lives.     So my answer is no I wouldn't have voted for him because I believe some of those government aid programs actually go to people who have worked all their life and put their money in the system so they can retire, or people who are just being screwed by this economy and losing their jobs, or people who are actually physically disabled and maybe need help. They want to work but it might take them some time to actually get a job.

Finish high school and get your diploma. Then try the army if you still want to! You may be surprised to find out that you no longer want this after you graduate, but if you still do, enlist then and go for it!  You could also try the Delayed Entry Program. That allows you to enlist, but not report for a length of time (I think it's six months to a year), but remember; once you sign that enlistment contract, you're a g.i. for at least six years active and reserve duty.

"it is not about the destiny but about the journey"    and also did u know if u live until 80 years old, u only live 4160 weeks? sad isn't it? and if u sleep 8 hours out of 24 hours, u are idle 1/3 of ur life. omg life is short heh?|`|AA11452842	You can enlist during summer before your senior year.

DTSUJe2oaa	Congratulations on your engagement! Here's what you need to know to make the marriage legal in the Federal District of Mexico City.       The following are the requirements for marriage in the Federal District (Mexico City). However, marriage requirements prevailing in the thirty-one states of Mexico are in general very similar to those of the Federal District.     Legal Requirements    Consent: People under the age of 18 may not get married in Mexico without parental consent. With parental consent, boys have to be at least 16 and girls need to be at least 14 years of age.     Foreigners Getting Married to Foreigners: You don't need to be resident in Mexico in order to get married there, you'll just need a passport and your tourist permit, plus some other paperwork (see below). If you plan to get married to a Mexican in Mexico, you will need additional documentation.        Chest X-rays and Blood Tests: hese must be done locally in Mexico, as the results of the blood tests and the X-ray documentation must be in Spanish and the tests need to be done within a certain time frame of the Marriage Application Form being completed. Not all states require the Chest X-rays. Check locally.      Four Witnesses: You will need to have 4 witnesses present at the legal ceremony, and they must have valid identification (Passport).      Validity Outside of Mexico: Your Marriage Certificate will be valid world-wide, BUT you should get your certificate 'legalised' in Mexico to ensure it is legally accepted when you get back home. The process is the reverse of getting your Native documentation legalised by the necessary authorities (e.g. Foreign Office) for marriage in Mexico (see below); The registry office in Mexico will tell you where this can be done locally.      Required Legal Documents    An American or other foreigner wishing to be married in Mexico must present to the appropriate Civil Registry certain documents described in the paragraphs below. All documents from the U.S., except for the valid U.S. passport, must be authenticated by an American authority (usually the Secretary of State), from the state where they originated, who attaches an "Apostille" to the documents listed below.      Important! ALL Foreign documents listed below (with the exception of your passport) will need to be:  Translated into Spanish;      Notarised by your nearest Mexican Consulate and;      Be 'Legalised' in the country where you live by the appropriate organisation or authorities. (In the UK the Foreign Office undertakes this task; link to the Legalisation page the on the Foreign Office's web site for details about obtaining this service).         Marriage Application Forms: These forms are attained from the local registry office in Mexico. You will need to specify whether you will get married under joint or separate property on this form.      Passport: Full Passport, valid for at least 6 months and a copy of same (both the bride and groom).      Travel Permits: Original copies of the tourist permit which was completed at the port of entry or other resident permit (visa, FM3, FM2, etc)      Birth Certificates: These will need to be certified and translated by an approved translator. Contact your nearest Mexican Consulate for more details.      Divorce Decree / Death Certificate: If either or both persons were previously married, then copies of Divorce Decree/ Death Certificate, if applicable (see Previously Married) will be required for presentation.~
WCkOUF9aaa	Paying taxes is for the "little  people" you know...    What about spouses that are lobbyists? Is that Ok I guess?      WASHINGTON  Tom Daschle's rise to the helm of the Senate spotlights an awkward fact of life for Washington's power couples: When professional lives intertwine, ethical conflicts can follow.    The South Dakota Democrat's wife, Linda, is a lobbyist who mostly represents airlines, aircraft makers and other aviation-related interests  all of which have a steady stream of issues before the Senate. As majority leader, Tom Daschle has the power to set the Senate's agenda.    Linda Daschle says she will deal with that potential pitfall the way she has since she resumed her lobbying career in 1997: by never lobbying her husband or any member or committee of the Senate. "With dual careers in public policy, you need to be careful and take steps to avoid any appearance problem," she says.

My guess as to why he did this is his inexperience is showing.  Let's not forget that before he started running for president, he was in the senate for 17 months.  He may have some intelligence and he certainly is a great public speaker, but long term experience and judgement are severely lacking.  We will all pay the price.  Today's appointment of republican Judd Greg is a huge effort on his part to appear non-partisan and to save face after all this mess that has befallen his administration.  I'm from NH and mourn the loss of Judd Greg, he's a very strong and intelligent person and I doubt there will be anything wrong with his record, upon investigation.    I do worry that someone (the present NH Gov Lynch) will go back on their word and not appoint a republican to replace Judd.  Even still, the individual that is being talked about to replace Judd is a "nobody" and I fear that she will be "trounced upon" by the dems in the next election, two years from now.  They are blood thirsty to get that extra seat in the senate and this could be a trap to get a strong senator such as Judd out of office as they fear his reelection will happen.  Having a rookie in office gives them more of a change.  Judd is quite well respected here in NH.  I've met him and he is just what I would refer to as "sound".  In fact, he's make a great 2012 Presidential candidate.  I hope Judd knows what he is getting himself into, but as a NH resident, I am proud of him and am glad to see another republican appointment.  It's all for show purposes, but at least there will be one voice of reason amongst the vipers and dishonest tax cheats.|`|U50orfPhaa	Thats the way he was trained , its the Chicago Machine Trained President, I expect more corruption in a few days at least.

nC6qEW1Paa	From my experience going from E1 to E5, it's your leadership. I've seen people get pushed through fast because they were liked, and people that should have gotten it get held back(happened to me). I was working in a position that was 2 ranks above me as an E4, technically I should have gotten a unilateral promotion to CPL, a simple 4187 that gets voided when you change duty stations. My problem was the Platoon Sergeant at the time didn't like me because I had an opinion and wasn't his lap dog. I had 8 soldiers and 350 vehicles to account for and around 5 people to report to on various issues as Shop Foreman.     Simply if all you care about it getting the rank fast, kiss butt. When it comes time to go to the promotion board they'll get you in. Just make sure they're not failing you by not teaching you anything, that happens way too much. As for how often, there are time in service and time in grade requirements for each rank, can't remember what they are though.|`|bd63392dda83587abd5834e2e866557faa	For a Soldier to get promoted, he has to meet a certain criteria. Time In Grade/Time In Service is an important factor when getting promoted especially when you are you are shooting for your E-5 (SGT). Along with your TIS/TIG, you have to attend a promotion board. Standing in front of one CSM and usually four 1SG's, reciting the NCO Creed/Soldier's Creed/Regimental Song and basic FM and AR information. Your APFT scores, civilian education, military education, medals, commander's preference points, and weapons qualifications all play a big factor as well. Once you have convinced them you are ready, you will be sent to the Warrior Leader Course (WLC) Once completed and you graduate, you you will have to wait to see you if you make points for that month in your MOS group. Some people make points before they are sent to the course. My personal opinion is against that because what if they fail WLC? It happens.     Sergeant to staff sergeant  72 months time in service and 10 months time in grade (Primary)    71 months time in service (less than 72 months) and nine months time in grade (less than 10 months) (Secondary)    Specialist/corporal to sergeant    36 months time in service and eight months time in grade (Primary)    Less than 36 months time in service and less than eight months time in grade (Secondary)     Semi centralized Promotion process means that the unit (company) plays a part in the promotion selection process, but it's the Army (Army-wide) who decides who actually gets promoted. As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, within each Army MOS (job) there are limited numbers of who can hold the ranks of E-5 and E-6 at any given time. When vacancies open up (due to people getting promoted or people getting out), the Army has to decide (Army-wide) which E-4s (within that MOS) to promote to E-5 and which E-5s to promote to E-6.    There are two promotion processes known as "Primary Zone" and "Secondary Zone." Most enlisted are promoted in the "Primary Zone." The "Secondary Zone" gives an opportunity for commanders to give "exceptional performers" an early shot at promotion.    http://www.army.mil/usapa/epubs/pdf/r600...    Knock yourself out. AR 600-8-19|`|fc54c2a3209dfa64b36d0f66601ab9a6aa	For E1 (PVT) thru E4 (SPC) the promotions are automatic based on Time in Service and Time in Rank criteria.  You have to have so much of each to get promoted to the next higher rank.  You can get promoted quicker by getting waivers for time in service or time in rank criteria.  The Commander usually gives these waivers based on the First Sergeant's recommendations.  They are usually given to those that distinguish themselves as outstanding performers.  Some like to call it kissing ***, but saying someone is a "kiss ***" is the excuse of those that are too lazy to be an outstanding performer and doesn't have the drive for excellence.    The promotions for those ranks mentioned are automatic but can be denied based on poor perfromance.  The perfromace has to be extremely bad to be denied promotion.  This normally does not happen.  If a Soldier is that substandard to not get promoted then chapter paperwork should be intiated.|`|aYiVn74saa	if you kiss-up and show off, maybe you'll be ranked up|`|XWetnjgkaa	for guys, its kissing ***...for girls, it's sucking Di ck. It happens as often as THAT happens..|`|C975dCYsaa	Depends on your performance and if you have leadership qualities. You can also get promoted for your level of experience. It could happen in a week or even 10 years it all depends on your work ethic.

When you enlist, you will be given a report date and that depends on when a boot camp slot is open. Air Force basic is 8.5 weeks.   When you report to boot camp, you will see that there are hundreds of men and women in different periods of training.  Be prepared physically and mentally: you will have an Air Force (Training instructor) with you from the moment you arrive on base (Lackland) and you better be prepared for that person yelling in your face. The first few days can be confusing, but do what the TI says, look smart and do your best. In order to graduate boot camp, you need to be able to do 20 pushups, 20 pullups, and run 1 mile in under 8 minutes as well as learn basic first aid and how to fire an M-16.  The rule of thumb for boot camp of any service is that the instructors trey and break down individuals and then build up the military side as a team. Think like that and you'll be okay.  Good luck.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	It starts about four seconds before you step off the bus.

H0cbAlNXaa	The Soviet-Afghanistan war did. The CIA funded a lot of groups within Afghanistant in their fight against the Soviets including extreme muslims who would later go on to create Al Qaeda.     The reason people quote this war as what led to them is that they were funded and armed during this war, once this war was over they still had large amounts of money and weapons sitting idle and they put them to use fighting against those who they felt were against their religion.    Desert Storm had nothing to do with Al Qaeda although it did infuriate the Muslim communities in the area that the US was taking part in Middle eastern Politics, especially after the US diplomat told Iraq that the USA had no opinion on the Iraq/Kuwait border dispute.|`|midmBgJJaa	Decades ago we gave Bin Laden arms to fight the Soviets.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, it actually lead to the creation of the "mujahideen" or freedom fighters, the CIA did major secret operations to fund, and arm this militant group to remove the Soviets out. This was actually a grudge that we held for the Soviets arming the Vietcong,NVA back in Vietnam. Osama bin Laden was trained and equipped by the CIA, after he was joining his men against the invasion. After 9 years of rough guerrilla tactics against the Soviet military, they retreated, and of course they won. But it was known as the Taliban after they took control of their government. Al-Qaeda formed after the Taliban, because the US government established a military airbase in Saudi Arabia, this was a prime cause that made Osama point his guns at us, because he saw this as a imperialistic move against the Arab world, of course, we wanted oil. The Gulf War was only a war against the Iraqi military, but al-Qaeda did grow by sheer numbers when we started to bomb the No-Fly Zones, which was a Sunni area, for 10 consecutive years. There were no al-Qaeda camps in Iraq when we invaded, but they started to infiltrate the area to get rid of us after we invaded. They already have Sunni militias backing them up, so this war made things worse, no doubt.|`|6eiIyvUkaa	I can't speak as much to the Desert Storm part of your question, but in the Soviet/Afghan conflict, the US did a lot of Black Ops stuff, providing weapons and logistics to the Taliban.    I know you asked about Al Qaeda specifically. I would surmise that the arms dealing with one organization bled over to another, and since we didn't clean up and finish the job in either war (despite being within spitting distance of Baghdad in Desert Storm) it served to keep the whole region destabilized.    Wiki has a VERY good history of both wars.
28yMpUfSaa	It's not an absence of rules, it is an absence of rulers.    Money - In anarcho-communist communities, there is no money. In mutualist ones, there is. Community banks could issue money, as could individuals; however, the value of the money would depend on the values of the backing media [goods or services]. Most anarchists are panarchists at some level, and expect people to try different approaches in different communities.    Errico Malatesta:   http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_Arc...    Crime - Without the state criminalizing acts among consenting parties, and without monopolies depriving people of the means of subsistence, we get rid of most crimes of desperation. Anarchists have proposed everything from shunning to vigilanteism to deal with the remainder; I would prefer non-violence, but most anarchists propose community militias, and some propose private protection agencies instead of or alongside them.

Anarchists (also known as libertarians or libertarian  socialists, in the original sense of socialism as worker-  ownership-and-control of the means of production)  oppose illegitimate authority and hierarchy, and therefore  oppose capitalism and the state; anarchists do not oppose  all organization: anarchists favor voluntary, non-  hierarchical, self-organization. Anarchists do not oppose  all rules and laws; anarchists oppose rules and laws  imposed involuntarily by illegitimate authorities, such  as the state, and favor voluntarily-agreed-upon rules and  laws.

True anarchy though is more of a model for the spectrum.... Just as one must understand Black and White to find different shades of grey.|`|H0cbAlNXaa	Supposedly, and I would say this can't work in our current societies, everything is handled as a community. I'ts not about no government as much as the government being more of a community government. How things are handled is not a set in stone issue. Different anarchists say different things but I would say none of them have a true answer that deal swith everything at this time.    Rules must be followed or you could be cast out of the community, killed or punished by the community (depending on which anarchist you ask)  Taxes woudln't be needed as there is no central government, local communities would deal with things thereby making taxes fairly useless. Money in general would become less essential and barter would be a much more likely way of dealing with purchases and such.   You would not get things for free, you would barter for them.    As I said I don't think Anarchy would work though as it fails to take into consideration people's love of following those who are charasmatic even if they are spouting terrible things (Hitler, Pol Pot, Stalin, Mao and many many more throughout history)

hexzaIGgaa	My young friend...I'll let you in on a little secret. Aside from being a former USAF SSgt & Captain (Psychologist), I too suffer from Bipolar Disorder. In fact, one of the reasons for my discharge (asthma was the other, greatly exacerbated by dealing with toxic agents and fumes in Vietnam), was my very late diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I. I was originally diagnosed with an Acute Situational Reaction while in VietNam...and that was later upgraded to full-blown BP I, due to major stressors I experienced in VietNam service (which I would rather not discuss). For years, I blamed myself for missing my own diagnosis. It (and the asthma) ended a very promising career, but rules are rules. I am happily married and the Dad of two sets of twins...and I retired at a very young age.    I have lived a relatively normal life after diagnosis and following a strict medication regimen...but I know that the USAF couldn't keep me on. I held a Top Secret clearance as an NCO and dealt with nuclear weapons targeting. Tell me...now that you know more about your illness, do you really want that level of stress? Do you realistically expect the military to put up with the symptomatology that goes along with being an untreated Bipolar? Of course not.    Sure, you feel hurt and sad. I was devastated when I lost my career, but I went on to an 18 year career as a civilian Psychologist, marriage and Family Therapist, and College Professor/Administrator. You can do the same.    There are many other avenues available if you want to serve your country...for example, what about finding a job working FOR the Army?    Don't give up on life, even though the military door will ALWAYS be closed to you. When one door closes...another usually opens up.    Take care and work on your education and keeping on your medications. And, remember this very important thing, "You are NOT your diagnosis...you are a person with Bipolar Disorder, not a Bipolar Person."    - Yggdrasil, Former USAF SSgt & Captain (retired)  Disabled Veteran  Clinical Psychologist    Bipolar Disorder I, Without Psychotic Features  Anxiety Disorder NOS|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	While I can't fault Yggdrasil's answer in the slightest, I would like to use a different track.    You and I are deployed to a forward location.  There is a sudden, huge explosion and with no warning, you and I end up taking cover behind the same piece of blown up equipment.  Who exactly am I taking cover with?  Joyous Wendy?  Depressed Wendy? Manic Wendy??    I need the Wendy that I can trust and depend upon... and in a deployed situation, we can't guarantee that you will have access to whatever meds you may need to control your situation.  What happens if you decide that you don't NEED to be medicated and stop the meds?  You can't guarantee that you won't have a manic attack - and in a combat situation there are enough variables.    We can't AFFORD someone that has pre-existing condition.    Sorry if that's not what you wanted to hear.
BLTq0vLWaa	It all depends on what you like mate, The RAF Regiment doesn't just 'Gaurd Airfields' among their duties when deployed are: Quick Response Force, Long Range Patrol (up to 60 miles from base), Foot Patrols, Specialised Sniper Sections, Airborne Snipers, Casualty evacuations and a dedicated parachute squadron.  And many people who make up the Special Forces Support Group are drawn from the RAF Regiment, aswell as other units.    And are deploying on an average of 11 months currently.    I'd suggest you go and visit your AFCO as they can offer you better advice than anyone on here.    Good luck ;)|`|44PoKKMmaa	at your age i would recommend the army, you have a lot more choice in the army, you can get a trade and play about with different regiments, from cooking, to electrician, to infantry man, and there is flying involved init with the army air corps, so i would go with that|`|EG1WRTT7aa	well it is hard to decide, but all i can say to you is to follow your heart if you just follow what ur heart decide to do you will find the good solution for ur problem i wish u good luckto whatever you will choose!!|`|Mhmyzso6aa	Well im American and there is no RAF Regt but if your air force is like our air force and your army is like our army id say join the air force you get paid more and you dont get bullshitted around with your money. i went down to meps and the army recruits were gettin fucked over left and right some werent getting there sign on bonus and some wernt getting shipped out till january 13 of next year. the air force dont dick around and thts what i would do|`|kdgdwERaaa	If you want to be an Infanteer, join the Army.

Secondly, you will be the ones to go in first and secure the airfields, before the Army drop in later when everything is safe.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	RAF Regt do airfield security and anti aircraft artillery.

fYWE0fBjaa	The question needs qualifying.  Are you talking about Health and Safety at Work Act or maybe road traffic accidents,or something else?  Which country - UK?  Possibly different for Scotland in any case.

Not entirely sure if that is what you were asking but as it was in the law enforcement and Police section I'd have a wild stab at it.
gIqVnbn4aa	I personally like the navy but for you i would recommend the air force due to the fact that you are going to have a family. Both the navy and the air force are good services but in the air force your family can live with you, in the navy you could very likely be assigned to a ship and sent overseas for a very long time.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	The question boils down to service onboard ships.  If you find you ill be happier deploying for six months or more when assigned to a ship while putting up with one in three duty days and weekly ops when not deployed by all means Go Navy.  If service in the heartland Is more to you liking then I'm sure the Air Force is the one for you.|`|YNqPRESjaa	My husband has been in the Navy for 20 years right now, he loves it, he has two kids who have loved moving around. its a great life for some people that can handle it, now my husband is a Chief Corpsman working with the Marines|`|LcLGnTVMaa	"Better" is a term which only you can define. If you have an idea of what type of career you want to pursue either in the military or civilian life, try to evaluate which branch offers you the best opportunity to achieve that goal. If its just a coin flip for you, my vote, NAVY. I say that because I have had many family members in the navy, all spoke very highly of the their experience. Good luck either way, both branches will offer great opportunities for you.|`|Ch7Q3buOaa	Go with the Coast Guard. They have a great mix of shoreside and shipboard billets.|`|xjb72SOpaa	I may be a bit biased since I'm AF but you are more likely to have an assignment that will be more family-friendly in the AF. The Navy is a close second though. You have to determine if you'd rather spend the time apart from your family in Iraq, Korea, Afghanistan or Qatar than Iraq, Afghanistan, Qatar or on a ship. Either way, there will be pros and cons when it comes to having a family while serving. Ask your future spouse for input so the both of you can make a decision that you believe in.

579276f1a955ed5c170f87a86360c3b2aa	Im in Cali and I have heard of this. IDK if this would apply to you if you work for the same employer and just have your hours cut but I found this:  The "partial wage formula" used to compute partial weekly UI benefits is shown below:    Subtract $30.00 from the gross income.     Multiply the remainder by .67 (67%).     Subtract this new amount (including the cents) from your WBR.     Round the remainder down to the nearest whole dollar. This is the amount of partial UI benefits payable for the week.     NOTE: The smallest UI check that we will pay is $5.00, so if your calculation results in an amount which is less than $5.00, no payment will be made.      You can always attempt to apply or call. The worst that can happen is that they deny you. Its better than not trying at all.|`|Gezfmghuaa	Besides being still employed, unemployment payments are reduced by the amount of income you have.  I would hope that 32 hours of pay equals more than the WI unemployment payment.|`|9Fq3jyykaa	Same thing happened to me in Indiana - but we were told by the unemployment office that 32 hours is considered full time - sucks!|`|8454b08cd94e39ec6f1c2eb2f2b07a68aa	Um, no. You are working 32 hours per week...you are still employed. Still employed means no unemployment.
Gezfmghuaa	I can't speak to specifics, but generally the process is very simple, if a bit emotionally charged.      One party in the case will make their request for support.  The other party will counter and give reasons, this repeats until all sides have made their points and the judge makes a ruling that is binding on all parties.|`|e80UbgPqaa	Was an order entered?  That will make a difference.  You can't just ignore an order.  His best bet is to contact an attorney and see if he can have the order modified (although he probably won't be able to do this before March).  Best bet - ask for the modification now, anyway.  Remember - you don't have to agree with a judge's ruling.  Once the ruling is entered, you are required to obey it until you successfully appeal.  Good luck
fOAKaLrSaa	The answer to your question will depend on which state you are in.  I would recommend familiarizing yourself with your state's child support laws before your boyfriend goes to the hearing.  You can probably do a quick internet search to find the information.  That will help you better understand what information will be important for the judge to know.       Generally, most states have a provision that allows them to consider certain "hardships" - such as the obligation to support other children of a different relationship - when considering child support.  Otherwise, the Court would essentially be taking money from child to give to another.  That is not right.      Since you are pregnant and do not work, and since your boyfriend must support you and the new child, the Court will most likely consider these facts when ordering child support for his other child.  There is only so much money that can go around.|`|XR03jIndaa	Just goes to show atternoys dont know everything. He wont get in trouble with the IRS if he claims you on his return. As long as you live with him all year and dont provide more then half your own support.     As for the child support, MOST states will lower his support in consideration for other children in his household. that are HIS.|`|4eb0e2f9d5b148fde3255d87f69f396daa	Actually, the child support will be based on his net wages (after taxes).  The court does not care how many other children by other mothers he has when considering the amount of child support owed on this child.  He will have his day in court and hopefully, they will leave him with enough to live on.|`|3fP5cyEMaa	Some states calculate their child support differently, but most calculations do have allowances for other dependents. That would include your son only, not you, and other biological children he has.|`|e80UbgPqaa	Uhhh - if he is your boyfriend, how does he claim you on his taxes???  He is going to have more problems than just a crazy jealous baby mama if the IRS catches up with him.  He can, of course, claim your child on his 2009 taxes but claiming you?  Not a good idea.  Do you mean he claims you on his tax withholding on his salary?  That may be okay as long as he doesn't end up owing at the end of the year.  But if you mean he is claiming you on his return (1040), that will mean trouble if he is audited.    To answer your question, child support is figured, really, by computer programs that determine how much each parent should contribute to the child.  He can mention that another child will be joining his household  the following month but I'm not sure it will make a big difference.|`|CowgOqXTaa	It varies by State, but in most States the concept for child support is "First in Time, First in Line". When calculating child support, subsequent children are not taken into account.    Richard

SWkaGJpgaa	It won't create jobs; it might provide more work for companies in the business, but that doesn't equal job creation, which can only be done by money being invested by and on the private sector.    Considering the entirety of this package will have to be borrowed (because the budget is already running a deficit), that means there will be that much less money for businesses to be able to borrow.    All historical economic data show that such spending as we have in this bill, it will not create jobs or stimulate the economy. Historic economic data indicates that what is necessary is a reduction in the business tax rates, reduction in investment tax rates and reduced government spending.    Because businesses expand when they have lower tax burdens, and when government spending is reduced, that frees up more money that businesses can borrow. It also frees up credit for people to make durable goods purchases.|`|VV7zNqQbaa	Are you under the impression that the people who build bridges and roads are government employees?

0a3a0d81fa8d7a297abb8625fa7800beaa	You have two issues with your Alabama license.    The seatbelt violation and the court suspension that was tacked on to your guilty plea of your Marijuana Possession 2nd Degree or "POM 2nd" (13A-12-214).    Once you pay your seatbelt fine(s) you will clear that issue with your license. You would have still waited until your court ordered suspension was terminated.    Since you've finished the punishment for the POM 2nd you can now get your license "reinstated." There is, however, a reinstatement fee of about $50.00.     Contact your Drivers License office in the county you reside in and you'll be able to handle your issue there.|`|vFvI16P7aa	You should be able to.  A conviction for a seat belt ticket by itself would never get your license suspended, it was only because you didn't take care of the ticket.  So, pay the ticket, you should be able to get it reinstated.
N20xNbOyaa	The problem is that all of the laws that apply to garage sales are not listed as garage sale laws.  That is not the way it works.    But you will need to look at three things, primarily:    1.  The local ordinances of your town, city, township or village.  You will need to look at provisions regarding garage sales as well as those regarding business licenses.    2.  Any rules of your neighborhood association, landlord or condominium association.    3.  The restrictive covenants that are recorded upon your property as obtainable from the register of deeds for your county.    State laws will apply too, but will not speak to how long you can have a garage sale.  They may restrict your ability to run a business from your home without acquiring a license, though.|`|AA12165129	google it :)  haha  thats what i would do.

(Paying taxes and getting drivers licenses are obligations of residents.  They don't make you a resident, but are evidence that you intend to remain permanently.)  If you are under 18, your residence is almost always that of your parents.    I assume you are asking about resident tuition.  That requires that you have been a resident for at least a year.  Just being in the state for educational purposes does not alone show that you are a resident (i.e., intend to remain permanently).  Unless you are over 24, it also requires proof of financial independence.    Of course, none of that will help you at Pepperdine, which is not a State school, but maybe you are thinking of transferring?|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Move in with intent to stay.

There are degrees of ADD, from minor to major, but to lump all in a one size fits all box is disingenuous. You should know that.    I knew a guy who could function in society, but was a burned out ACID head that had major problems concentrating and holding down a job for more then a day.  Did he deserve aid, after all it could be construed he did this to himself, or can it?      The mind is only marginally understood and I have found, in my 58 years on this planet, that the assumptions that are made are changed when new assumptions are brought forth.  That the meds that are taken, in many cases, do not cure the symptom, but rather mask it.    Peace  Jim    .
DhUMjZxtaa	no you cannot.|`|3yXhtBSxaa	there is no price on bail he just needs a family member or a person over 21 outside of family to vouche fr him     You answered your own question right there, kiddo.|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	No, bail is always legally adults only. You must be 18.|`|8376bdc87fccc5f06632449f618f2e8eaa	Nope, you can't bail him out. I think your parents have made a very wise choice to not bail him out. This may be a minor theft, but it was still THEFT. He needs to learn that he can't steal and get away with it. Next time, he may not be so lucky.|`|ipnR7zQfaa	Find a neighbor or a friend's parent to help you out. It's cruel to leave him in there but I think your parents are trying to teach him a lesson. I'm sure they wouldn't leave him in jail for over a couple days... unless he's messed up like this before.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	Let him pay for what he did...there are consequences for our actions and if he does not suffer the consequences he'll never learn. My parents got my brother out of jail over and over again because he did not learn and finally he got a 5 year sentence....let the boy learn.|`|K5RKIdHtaa	nope.
1yov0JF9aa	NO, a Medicare card is NOT a valid ID.  The reason is that the number on it can be some one elses SSN.    NO, I've never seen that, but that is what Medicare tells me.    A SS card and a drivers license is what you need, a US Passport negates/trumps the SS card and drivers license.|`|agR89OPtaa	Try it they may accept it.  But meanwhile you need to go to your social security office and request a replacement card.  I think you can do it online.  I hope you are monitoring your credit reports since you have lost your card.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	A government issued birth certificate or passport should help|`|IrahyL2Qaa	if you bring in that card you have , your birth certificate, and at least one form of ID (two would be better like a passport), i am pretty sure youll be fine....i only brought my birth certificate and state ID an i was fine.....just bring as much as possible|`|64SObnr5aa	My oh my, how things have changed.    It used to be, when I got a job, that I did not need to show squat.  That my memorized SS  is all they needed.  Then came the drivers license, but when 911 happened I then had to prove I was a citizen.    What will it be next, national ID?    YEP, that is in the works.    Peace  Jim    .|`|QvF8dR7Taa	i don't know,its a shame the government lost control of our borders and now we the people have to suffer the consequences of there incompetence got my SS number in the 50:s and it plainly says at the bottom of the card(not for identification use)we are expected to do the work that our government didn't.its just a symptom of the failure of responsible leadership,not just the president but the whole pom pus bunch in washington.where money changes a no to a yes..to many public servants serving them selves first.i am afraid a national identification card will be the next step to regulate our lives.do you realize that it the ruling powers want they could deny you the right to buy and sell?even employment would be imposable.

yGXKYptjaa	I may have this wrong but on tv someone said Speaker Pelosi said just that.  But please don't make the mistake of calling the senators different party members..     Case in point.  Repubs can mixed in and bill drops below $800 and now over $935, so a $35 billion drop and then a $100 billion jump up.  See both party members have to take care of the people that make it possible for them to be in office, that pay them money that employ their families, yes I am talking about the lobbyists!!    So please remember they not only give cash to the congress people that are elected to represent us, but there ae also over 35,000 lobbyist in Washington and guess what many relatives of our elected Congress work and are employed by them and don't forget that the money they get for their war chests have to be handled by someone, so why not another family mem.ber.  Yes lobbyist give over $4.2 billion to our Congress.    Now who do you think the Democrats and Republicans are representing.  Barack already had the tax cuts in there, so where did the other $100,000,000,000 come from.  Sad but true.  Read the links below.  See if your congress people are in the top money grubbers.  I come from the poorest state in the Union and yep one of our senators bring in the most of all!  He's a Republican and followed by Sen. Reid.

Vu7kCPesaa	Social Services is already an unconstitutional agency. They pretty much do whatever they damn well please. Most social services workers are all pricks that think they know what's best for your regardless of what you think, so I'm not sure talking to her superiors would help much, they may be proud of her for hunting these people down. That's pretty messed up that this is happening. How does your Ex keep finding out about who you are dating? You may want to file for a restraining order on her...|`|2wyDALHgaa	Having worked within both the social services system and the legal system I really can't see where any social services worker would get involved in a situation where there is really no problem at all.  None of these women have done anything illegal or in any way injurious to the children in their care and that is pretty much the only way that social services would get involved.  They have no mechanism to "track down" any fathers or to even check up on these women's situations unless one of the fathers have come forward to complain.  It would have taken three fathers who didn't know they had children to come forward and complain about what....not paying child support?  I can just see it now..."she had a baby by me and didn't tell me so that I could pay child support"  Even that certainly isn't a social services matter, it's more of a civil matter where they would sue for custody or access.    I honestly can't see any link between the the events other then what you would suppose.  It just doesn't make realistic sense.  I could see it if she tracked down these women and then brought up frivolous complaints against them but none of these are even within the realm of anything that Social Services would care about.    Make a complaint if you want but I really don't see where you have any evidence or any reasonable link between these types of events and this worker.|`|1JY3GY41aa	Wow if she is interfering that is some messed up stuff. What i would do would be to call one of her supervisors and get some information and take action from there.|`|ClPMA3wEaa	Stop dating chicks with kids. lol I'm just playing. If you really like the girl you are seeing at the time, now that you know what is going on....tell her. Tell her what might happen because your ex is a lunatic. Why not? She'll leave you anyways so maybe if she knows what's going on she might stand up for herself.|`|Slbt3UPxaa	How does she know these other girl's names?  Unless you are telling her, she would not know these girl's names and therefore could not investigate their situations.  Honestly though, I don't think that she is doing anything, she can't just pick and choose her cases, they would be assigned to her.  If she is breaking a confidential law, then yes, she is doing something illegal and could be dismissed from her job.  Otherwise, I can't say if she is abusing her authority or not. Add on:  I agree with Randy B, she wouldn't be hurting these girls by getting them child support, also as he said she would have no way of knowing their names unless they are in their file.  It is highly unlikely she is doing anything, other than playing head games with you.

Well he sure is saving the parents a lot of trouble and to further help them he can even book a wedding hall for the reception and caterers and all that... You see we are so jobless to sit and worry about what might happen if we were spotted with our partner out in public. We then have to change Democratic India to Dicatorship India and Muthalik would be the new Hitler. Who found these guys. Its high time we pelted stones at these guys. The government should not be involved in its citizens private matters rather take note of matters like clearing the slums and giving food to the poor.

It actually made the economy of 1929/1930 to 1935-1936 worse. Even after spending billions and running, at that time, the largest deficit in US history, the economy did not improve.

First and foremost, just because it is government owned doesn't make it socialist, what makes it socialist is when one group must pay more than another group (percentage wise).    The government is supposed to defend this country from all enemies, therefore it is the governments responsibilty to raise an army.  Could be handled by a flat tax (everybody pays say 3 cents on every dollar)      Police, fire, public schools   are necessary evils that need to be funded, and manged properly.  for i.e of bad management  St. louis city schools at one time had 100k students, now they have about 26k.  They still have enough room for 100k and are paying to keep the extra space in maintenance and utility, but every year they come to the people and ask for more money.  How is that proper stewardship of the peoples money.    Our roads are handled on a use tax basis.  I buy gas - I pay tax on gas - I support roads, again not socialistic in nature.     Our local courts are also supported buy property taxes and court fees, and federal highway are supported buy a use tax.    And currency is an invalid point,  we could go back to precious metals or bartering for services.      For us conservatives, it is not about paying taxes.  It is about paying to much taxes.  We want small but necessary government.  And government where it belongs.  The federal side should not control or influence our everyday lives the way it does.      Local - state- federal in that order.|`|jSR318mYaa	Do you mean that I could only have access to private schools where the kids get the better education?  Do you mean that I could only attend private colleges where teachers and students are admitted on merit instead of political correctness and quotas?  Do you mean I would be allowed to protect myself and my family without restrictions by depending on my neighbors, friends, and my own skills?  Do you mean that I could find justice without involving some political appointee?  Do you mean that I wouldn't have to fear a military under the control of some deranged despot?  Do you mean that my roads would be privately maintained?  Do you mean that half of my income would not be extracted from my paycheck to pay for social welfare programs for those who choose to live off of the government?  Do you mean that I would not be tied to a currency that has only the value the government allows?  That I would be able to trade with others based on the quality of my work or merchandise?    Interesting question.|`|Eo8I3fbnaa	nope|`|eu6UQElYaa	No use of currency?  Who the hell is stupid enough to think that currency is a socialist program?   You apparently.
AA10674998	Panic and unruliness always indicates an "end game" scenerio ... like we are seeing with the fear-mongering.    When a racket is going well, the thief tends to keep things steady and unalarming.  I am sure this practice has a pychological name.  But the goal for the racket is to keep it alive for the theif's benefactor (like their children for example.)    Lets say you live next to a dairy, and sneak over at night and get 1 gallon a day for your family.  Well in such a situation, you mend the fence and take only enough to not draw any suspicion.  However, if you continue to try to find a way to pilfer more and more milk ... making an operation of it ... you do so at great peril of being caught with your hand in the cookie jar.  At that point, there is non of the earlier concern not to draw attention.  That "walking on eggshells" is replaced with bandit mindset to smash and grab.  The gig is up, so to speak, and now you just want all you can carry out on your last go at it. You don't care if the dairy goes under or if all the cows are milked dry to the point of death.  All you want is all you can get away with knowing there is no need to salvage the mess, because there is no future in that racket anymore.    See the radical shift?    Now you have insight that few have about what is going on in DC and Wall Street.  They are not "stimulating" any economy.  Their goals are not to preserve it for future generations.  They want only as much grub as possible and they don't care the cost to the future.  The gig is up, and they know it ... The economy is going to burn and they don't care ... the replacement waits in the wings in a global "new world order" and for that to come, this racket must burn.      Watch and see how TARP and other similar plans throw trillions at the problem but none of that trillion gets loaned out to businesses that need it.  It is the bandit mindset.  They don't want to continue, and they won't let it, no matter how much is spent.  All they are doing is lining their pockets as long as they can with as much as they can.      The gig is up.  The end-game is on, so don't be deceived ... not "plan" exists to really "fix" this mess ... only to replace it.|`|SahUDTLnaa	The longer it takes to pass the plan the more and more people find out Obama.s doesn't have a clue what the heck he is doing.  the plan is just as trashy  and unfounded as he is.

Obama is exagerating the situation with the economy and rushing it through with scare tactics, bullying, and the argument that the american people voted for him. The white house is inundated with calls from voters who are protesting the stimulus. How does he put the two together? Maybe he is trying to pay back those who got him into office. After all there is money in there for groups like Acorn. He is a child who should not be allowed out without his mother. He is destroying our country. How do you think the terrorists feel when they hear him say our country is falling apart-they are toasting it!|`|0VZ8zxkVaa	Why are u asking critical questions for?

The faster that they can pass it, the faster they can stick us with the bill and raise our taxes to fund other stupid projects that dont even create jobs.|`|jREXwynVaa	Because politics is a sad, sad thing, and our government has too many ties and backing from the wealthy business owners.

He wants to win and appease his ever increasing ego.  He cares not for the American people or the fact his "stimulus" package won't stimulate much other than to line the pockets of the very interest groups he claims he doesn't like and the pork attached to it.      Obama and his ilk will attempt scare tactics as a way to ram this thing through.  He dares not anyone a long, slow look at the bill.  He doesn't want thinking, reasonable people to expose what is hidden within the pages of this package - not his democrats and especially the republicans.|`|HLHHM4Mtaa	They need to get this trillion dollar plan out of the way so as not to interfere with the three or four trillion dollar plan for next week.

How many new decent paying jobs will be created (at the cost of about one measly trillion dollars?

We even get our Oil from another Country...If we get this Stimulus passed, the money we would get, we will purchase these products and support again, the other Countries.   Our veggies are coming from another Country....Our cars are made from another Country...WalMart sells items from other Countries.....So, I say...if this does get passed and we get some money (from our own taxes that we have already shelled out to them...we're just getting a smidgen back from it), then keep it in OUR COUNTRY...go to yard sales, sports games etc. This is what I got from a friend of mine and it is so true. I'll send you a copy of what she sent in a person message, as some Y/A members may not like what it entails.  Then you'll see why I said this...  :-)    I don't know why our Senate is allowing this pressure, because this money will only go to support other Countries, unless we consumers take control of it and spend it only supporting USA products etc. Otherwise, the money will go NOT to support our Country, but to support others.|`|fAn14yGSaa	Proof that the government is doing the right thing for the economy.....

If people knew what the money was really going for they they would tell their senators, they had better NOT pass this thing. That would make Obama, Pelosi, and Reid look like the socialists they are.  They are trying to pay back the special interests groups that contributed big campaign money and helped them get elected.  It is a Bill of Payola.

I think someone needs to slide them the electoral map from Nov. 4th -- the majority of americans know that republicans have utterly failed and ruined us.

DiDCG9UBaa	I have the best possible solution (seriously) to the Bush Depression. The link is below. As to your proposals:    1) Of course. That's what government's supposed to do.     2) There's no reason not to.    3) I don't really think that would be much of a stimulus, but you are right.    The government wastes billions of dollars everyday. Any "stimulus" shouldn't just include spending, but should also include cuts. There's no question about that.|`|AA11318630	legalize pot tax it heavy i agree with the rest|`|IIIksjjtaa	If you live in San Francisco, you should run against Nancy Pelosi.

Infrastructure:  highways, bridges, telecommunications... ect.    the second count is longer term.  It is the investments in technology like clean energy and scientific pursuits of this nature.  These things will stimulate jobs when science becomes engineering and engineering becomes technology.

Vu7kCPesaa	If we are not in a depression (IE: for those of you lying to yourselves still), one is coming very soon.    Inventing more fake money is not the solution. The problem is bad spending practices to begin with (along with a self destructive economy in the first place thanks to the Federal Reserve Bank). Your solution would cause massive inflation which would increase the problem.|`|eu6UQElYaa	No we're in a recession until the real GDP declines by more than 10%.     Liberals will never give money to the people because liberals believe the government handles our money better than we do.  That's why we can't just take the billions and billions of dollars and give it to people who need it, liberals are in charge so that money must go to "programs".|`|P8CBDLiKaa	So far just the worst recession since the Great Depression.    And you can't just print money and hand it out, that causes inflation, so money is worth less, so the economy gets worse and then we really are in a depression.    The mortgage crises can't be cured just by bringing the mortgages current; so many of the homes are now worth less than what is owed on them that there needs to be a major realignment of how the mortgage industry works.    It took years and years of fiscal stupidity to get us to this point, it's going to take time to get us back out.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	we defiantly are in a depression with deflation.it will get a lot worse before better.the price of things were not determined by the market place but Wall street.and it became bloated with worthless stocks.seems every body thought you could make money from money and not produce a product of any kind.its like a dog chasing its own tail.till it catches it and finds out the chase was useless.|`|i0vcEyJtaa	No, not yet. We are in a severe depression, if we continue to spend and spend, while we create more inflation, and when the bonds, and stock market collapses, then we will be in a depression. With jobs disappearing and people getting laid off is just a huge consequence of a severe recession. IF these bail-outs pass to "stimulate" the economy, it will be nothing more than adding fuel to a fire, which will cause a collapse of the Dollar, interest rates skyrocketing, economy dead, prices of food sky high, and gas very unaffordable.|`|1amF7oNwaa	NOT YET BUT THE FAR LEFT IN CONGRESS ARE WORKING VERY HARD ON IT.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	no, it's a recession|`|3nLypUaiaa	It's a recession.

AA11025669	Now days, government is not for the hardworking tax payers, they support low life's who milk our tax money. Government continues to steal from us and redistribute our wealth to lazy low life's who will not work and who have been taught since birth how to milk the system. Politicians know that whoever they give money to will continue to vote for them, so the cycle is endless.    Now, with the emergence of illegal aliens, they also are taught by liberals how to milk our system for their personal gain.

TANF is only five years as created by the Federal Government, states can have it  go longer.

The reality is the two coexist.      A socialist corporation designing TVs would have very little incentive to provide improvements in their products.  So its best to have many capitalist enterprises performing that function.  They compete to drive down their own costs and add features to do better than their competition.    Capitalism is not appropriate to every situation though.  For example, a Fire Department that charges people to put their house fires out would not be in the best interest of the community, because if your neighbor couldn't pay then your house might catch on fire.    Some situations are more open for debate.  A lot of people feel that you can't trust capitalist medicine.  It results in situations where treatment is very expensive and only the rich get a good quality of care.  Where in a socialized medical system you can provide a better general level of care to everyone.  This system is worse for the wealthy, but good for the masses.|`|ejluOCdTaa	NOUN:     1.

Hayek thats depicts the steps in which socialism lends to serfdom:    http://mises.org/books/TRTS/|`|961PBKmAaa	It's called earning what you get and not being a leech on society.  Socialism blows, so get off your *** and get a job.|`|ghljQhGIaa	if it's sooo good why don't you just explain it so that we can all understand it!|`|U3j7oVflaa	It isn't... you've just been brainwashed to be closed minded and not really think about things.    No major form of government is really and truly superior to any other.    It's all in the implementation and the details.    It can be argued that Capitalism is simply Feudalism again wherein the Kings are CEOs and Serfs are employees...  It's all relative and dependent upon how it's implemented...    People who chant "capitalism" blindly tend to be those who have a lot of money/power or inheritance, so they are defending their "earnings"... or... they are very egotistical people who are caught up in the "dream" of becoming a self-appointed CEO in charge of tons of riches and people...  these people of course are going to blindly chant for what would benefit them in their dreams or keep them on top of the world, nothing wrong with that... but, they aren't correct in arguing that it's better for "everyone"... just "them" (they think ;) ).|`|b2261d1342601255ca19eb8cac0fdf39aa	It isn't!|`|ss0vy4tFaa	in capitalism, the harder you work the more you earn. in socialism, everyone earns the same no matter how hard you work. and this didn't come from fox news.|`|8di5Wn3naa	Actually neither are better.    Capitalism leads to slavery. (as in sweatshops) The only capital resource a company has to play with is labor (all others are fixed), so the most profitable thing would be to pay people next to nothing.    Socialism leads to poverty, since no one wants to put in to the system more than the next guy (if the outcome is always the same). Basic game theory.    But what does work is a mixed economy. Private enterprise where both risk and payoff are privatised mixed with social programs that provide real opportunities for wealth creation, and protect against the excesses of industry.|`|296b3ddd20aa6b7c48fb40d2c187aedfaa	Capitalism is deception about ownership of companies.    There are all new companies, stores, restaurants, and banks every 4 years and an average employment duration of 1 year within false economics capitalism, (that is possibly a secret homelessness-without-health insurance death camp). Remaining solvent does not actually exist within false economics capitalism.    Get rich quick schemes in the capitalist business world, (buyouts, IPOs, conglomerates, acquisitions, mergers, and the stock market), do not actually work. Profit existing in the capitalist business world, or millionaires existing within capitalism, is pathological deception committed by the 21 organizations spying on the population with plain clothes agents, (with covert fake names and fake backgrounds).    Actual economics is the persons that are paying the business loans of companies voting at work in order to control the property they are paying for. The employees of companies are also paying the expenses of companies beyond the salary of the employees.    Capitalism is the psychology of imaginary parents, false economics, and the criminal deception of employees that are paying the bills (including the stocks and bonds, or shares) of companies.

Look, it's not the color that makes a person like they are , it is how they are raised. If you take a black child or mexican child and place it with 2 white doctors and it goes through medical college, do you think it will be in the ghettos? No, it will eventually wind up in a neighborhood like yours.      I am aware that part of what you said is true , at least that whites tend to crave peace more, or outdoors, BUT this is not because we are white, it's because of our white culture and how we have been taught and raised.  So instead of being stuck on the "white" thing, then get stuck on having a good place to live and a nice home..surrounded by nice people.

According to your tired old generalizations, black people are foul-mouthed criminals and Philistines. You really couldn't come up with anything more original?    Would it offend you if I told you that I am mulatto and proud of it and proud that I live in a racially diverse community? One in which both black and white neighbors of mine will help me carry heavy bags, hold doors open for me when my hands are full, and trust each other with the babysitting of their children? One in which, as a person of color, I am free to move about as I please without feeling afraid for my physical safety? One in which I can walk down the street without the fear of being openly discriminated against? One in which the kids of our schools are of all different colors and cultures, and these differences are celebrated in ways which broaden their horizons and allow them to grow up understanding, accepting, and even loving people who are not like them? The kind of place where you can go to sporting events and there's no one saying "Dumb n******". Where the large and varied clientele keeps our stores and other local businesses in business. Where minorities don't have to feel threatened by lynching mobs on the street or at their jobs or in a parking lot.    Do I love a racially diverse America? You bet I do. I love a country in which tolerance, individual liberty, and progressive thought win out over irrational prejudice, misplaced nostalgia, and reactionary conservatism.    Why is it some people think one race carries the monopoly on patriotic thoughts?  There's a big difference between you and me.    Over the past 150 years, America has been making great strides forward in terms of making sure that the Constitution we were founded on isn't a hypocritical joke.  It seems like certain minorities want to prevent that progress in favor of their special interests.    I love my country's ability to reform itself by moving in a progressive direction.  Oh, and don't kid yourself.  As inter-racial marriage becomes more and more common and immigration continues, scientists estimate that whites probably won't be in the majority any more around the year 2050. And people of all races, whether white or not, will defend their rights to live and be free.    I'm afraid that according to science and history, it is actually YOUR way of life is not right for our beloved America.    Now go to bed, little troll. The adults are talking.|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	This Older White Military widow   Voted for Obama   And I am very proud that I did.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	Lucky you. And lucky us.    Ya know, vanilla's a great ice cream, but every day? No thanks.    No, nothing you can do on a computer can offend me. You offend yourself by eliminating most of the world in your narrow little mind.     Say "Hi" to Limbaugh, Coulter, Malkin, Matalin, Hannity and Bill-O next time they visit your trailer park.    I didn't say that to offend you. I hope it opens your heart, your mind and your eyes. You have just painted the rest of the world with a broad brush. Evidently you've never been to Hell's Kitchen in NYC nor to Southy (South Boston). You'd be horrified: all those white hoodlums just waiting for you, your wife, your daughter and your worldly possessions. But hey! they're white, so...    Offended?  No, I'm actually disgusted.    But ya know something? You might live long enough to see 2050 roll around, at which time the demographers and actuaries predict that "whites" will no longer be a majority in the U.S.     And there's NOTHING you can do about it.    My faith tells me that God created us ALLin His image and likeness. Once we slide out of the womb, all bets are off. Oh... by the way: you DO know that Christ was a short guy with a dark olive complexion, a hooked nose and dark long hair, prolly with a beard, too. One more thing: he was a JEW... got any of 'them' in your klaven? Sounds like He'd get driven out of your neighborhood, maybe chased out, maybe lynched, 'cuz it sounds like among the Neanderthals you live with, you might be the most educated. Must be really shallow in your end of the gene pool. Too bad.    But no personal insult intended or implied. You told it like it is for you and I told it like it is for me. We live on the same planet but I don't recognize your world. Maybe Alaska is in your future? You know, the home of unwed white teens and their hotty mamas? For when Appalachia gets overrun by "them" (that's code for you-know-whos and you-know-whats). A swarthy little Zapotec Indian was elected President of Mexico in the 1800's (how long will it take the U.S. to elect a Native American as our President?) and he had a very simple slogan, touchingly true to those whose souls have ears: "El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz." A caso usted no habla espanol (in case you don't speak Spanish), that means "Respect for others' ways is peace."    And you seem stuck on "taking back this country." Taking it back to the 50's? Segregation/ Lynchings? McCarthy? Congressman Nixon? Gas guzzlers? Condoms sold labeled "For the prevention of disease ONLY"? You must be kidding. It's not your country, it's OUR country. Every single one of us, or have you forgotten what "E Pluribus Unum" means? It means "out of many, one." Try living it some time.  .|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	What is offensive is you assumption that all white neighborhoods are safe little paradises, and all black neighborhoods are crime ridden hellholes.

As far as SMA. Im not sure.|`|2ieiGIhTaa	Master Sergeants are usually in technical or administrative jobs, while First Sergeants are the senior NCO in a Company.

As for the Sergeant Major of the Corps, that is a selection that is made by the Commandant of the Corps, so I'm sure that it is made by the Army Chief of Staff.|`|gOuKBfbcaa	Simple answer here    1SG is a company/troop first sergent...  he is actually in charge of people    MSG is the same pay grade as 1SG but does admin work and is not directly responsible for anyone.  In the army you have to do certain thing for a certain amount of time.  So you can be a 1SG for lets say 2 years and then become a MSG because you have completed your time and someone else needs the slot    A CSM is the same as a 1SG only one level higher.      A SGM is the admin like the MSG.  SGM is usually refereed to as the operations Sergeant major.    The Department of the Army decides weather you will become a CSM or a SGM  and you are that until you retire.

Me centrar en el tema que mas ruido esta haciendo para nuestros oidos, el de las negociaciones con ETA.  Las unicas imposiciones de las que hablas que hizo el PP contra ETA fueron la lucha contra una banda de asesinos, s, de ASESINOS, aunque a ti no te hayan matado a nadie gracias a dios, con los unicos medios de los que dispone un estado democrtico de derecho (no de "derechos" como pensais muchos), que son el poder de la Ley con la ayuda de los cuerpos de seguridad del estado.  La unica manera de acabar con esta banda de asesinos, repito, de ASESINOS, es pisarles el pescuezo hasta que el unico hilo de aliento que les quedara fuera para pedir perdon a las victimas y al pais en general; y eso, aunque a algunos no les guste, el PP lo estaba haciendo de perlas.  De hecho, miembros historicos de ETA encarcelados (Pakito por ejemplo) escribieron diversas cartas a la cupula de su organizacin terrorista asegurando que la lucha armada estaba perdida y que si queran seguir con sus ideales, no les quedaba mas remedio que deponer las armas. Pero ahora llega este cretino de ZP como le llaman, y no solo les da alas, sino que pone en sus manos las riendas para que puedan resurgir.  Negociar? Se puede negociar algo sin pagar ningn precio, sin ceder?Pero cuando os senteis para hablar de paz con esa banda de ASESINOS (Lo del termino paz es de risa yo no se que guerra es la que hay cuando en un bando estan las pistolas asesinas y en otro las nucas asesinadas), que creeis que van a pedir para dejar las armas? Pues lo que han pedido siempre, cojones, autodeterminacin, Navarra, pais vasco frances, libertad para presos..., que les damos? Vamos, elegid.  Solo digo que si tenemos que ceder para solucionar esto, deberiamos haber cedido antes, cuando Irene Villa an tena piernas, o cuando mis paisanos los Jimenez Becerril cuidaban de sus hijos, o Miguel Angel Blanco estaba vivo. Con que cara podemos mirar a esta pobre gente para decirles que las muertes de sus familiares no sirvieron de NADA?   El espiritu de ETA es el que se refleja en las caras de los asesinos de Miguel Angel Blanco, la chuleria y el saber que tienen agarrado al pais por los huevos.  Dicen por ahi que el PP no da alternativas? Volvamos a cumplir la Ley de Partidos y el Pacto por las Libertades y Contra el Terrorismo, (inventado por ZP por cierto). No eran esas buenas alternativas?  Todavia recuerdo esas palabras de "Merecemos un Gobierno que no nos mienta" Pues chico, ste se est hartando, que llevan con la negociacin preparada desde que estaban en la oposicin, y aun lo niegan.  Pero bueno, cuando el PP est ganando puntos ya saldrn unos cuantos documentales en la Primera (s, esa TV que se criticaba que manejaba Aznar a traves de Urdaci cuando estaba en el poder el PP, quin la maneja ahora?) de los atentados de Madrid y del Prestige, para refrescar las memorias de la gente con las artima?as que lo catapultaron al poder si ni siquiera esperarlo, y que lo est obligando a gobernar mediante la improvisacin-  Por ltimo, voy a citar unas palabras que dijo el revolucionario mas famoso de todos los tiempos, el Che Guevara, lider comunista por cierto. Dijo: "Prefiero morir de pie a vivir arrodillado", pues bien, los que mueren de pie son las victimas del terrorismo (bueno si no los arrodillan a punta de pistola, claro), asesinados por la espalda pero en definitiva, de pie, defendiendo lo que consideran mejor para Espa?a aun a costa de sus vidas; pero por lo que se ve,  lo que quiere este gobierno es que vivamos arrodillados, ante esta panda de, no me canso de ponerlo en mayusculas, ASESINOS. No puedo creerlo.  Me avergenzo de este pais de borregos, que slo quiere Salsa Rosa, el Hola, los triunfitos y pasin de gavilanes, y que cuando les preguntan sobre la negociacin con ETA responden " A m plin, con que me dejen tranquilo, tengo bastante."   Anda que estamos aviados con el Peta Zeta ste.|`|ec981a7fb9a65d9bb2e5b0ff6cd1ee88aa	Pienso que es el mejor presidente que ha tenido este pas desde que recuper la democracia. A pesar de algunas gilipolleces, como la persecucin a los fumadores, de una ley discriminatoria y seguramente anticonstitucional, como es la de la violencia de gnero y de algunas peque?as chapuzas ms (como la reforma de los impuestos, que empeora un tanto algo que ya es inaceptablemente insolidario), creo que es el primer presidente democrtico que aborda con valenta y sin crispacin (se?ores que opinan lo contrario, disclpenme, la crispacin que sufre este pas proviene nicamente del PP, del Mundo y de la COPE) problemas que han oprimido o enfrentado secularmente a los espa?oles.     Vivimos tiempos de polticas liberales y burguesas, de libertad de mercado rabiosa; tiempos en los que cualquiera que levante la voz contra estas grandes verdades es tachado por los "normales" poco menos que de mentecato y descerebrado. Tiempos de apogeo del Imperio Neoconservador Estadounidense. En esos tiempos, el gobierno socialista de Espa?a nada, hasta cierto punto, contracorriente, cumpliendo, poco a poco, el programa por el que fue elegido. Soldados fuera de Irak, alianza de civilizaciones. Regularizacin de inmigrantes; lucha, a la vez, contra la inmigracin ilegal y contra sus causas ltimas, perdonando deudas externas y aumentando presupuestos de ayuda al desarrollo (aunque sin exagerar). Reformas en los aparatos burocrticos del Estado, como la mejora en la tramitacin del divorcio. Intento de conseguir la igualdad de sexos (curiosamente a la vez que promulgan una ley que discrimina claramente a los hombres) y reconocimiento de los derechos a algunas minoras, como los homosexuales. Reforma de la educacin para hacer frente a la presin religiosa. Intentos ?realistas? de combatir el paro y la precariedad laboral. Mayor descentralizacin regional, con la reforma de los estatutos de autonoma, etc...    Pienso que en estos temas el gobierno va, aunque despacio, muy despacio, por el buen camino. Por supuesto, no voy a comparar su actuacin, su ideologa, con el anterior gobierno del "Espa?a va bien" que consigui meter a Espa?a en el "top ten" de los paises que ms millonarios tienen... y en la guerra de Irak, adems de crear un paraso para la especulacin inmobiliaria. S que lo comparara con el de Felipe Gonzlez, aunque reconozco que las circunstancias histricas eran muy diferentes: la transicin no estaba terminada, acababa de producirse un intento de golpe de estado militar, ETA atentaba cada poco tiempo, saliamos de una crisis econmica (espa?ola y mundial) y todava no estabamos integrados en la UE. Aun contando con todos estos condicionantes, el gobierno de Felipe me parece bastante menos avanzado ideolgica y socialmente, menos valeroso a la hora de imponerse a los tres grandes poderes fcticos:    - iglesia, ejrcito y otros restos de la Espa?a "Imperial"   - grandes empresas y "mercado" en general,    - extremismos nacionalistas, tanto regionales (vasco, cataln, etc...) como centralistas ( de nuevo "imperialistas" en los que sigue sin ponerse el sol).    Me siento orgulloso de ser de este pas cuando Bush o Rajoy llaman con desprecio a Zapatero idealista. Me gusta que el presidente de mi pas, como algunos otros lderes europeos, defienda unos valores que no gustan al emperador Bush ni a sus secuaces. ?Viva la Vieja Europa! Me siento orgulloso de que el presidente de mi pas sea uno de los pocos lderes mundiales que exige a Israel que pare el genocidio de Gaza y ahora la guerra del Lbano. Y posiblemente el que lo dice con voz ms alta. No es que Zapatero est haciendo una revolucin, pero lo que dice y hace lleva, en general, una direccin que a mi me parece correcta y valiente, aunque excesivamente prudente. Tal vez esa prudencia sea achacable a la falta de una mayora absoluta en las Cmaras, debido al estrecho margen de votos obtenido en las elecciones.    Opino que el PP tergiversa (miente, me atrevera a decir en ciertas ocasiones) todo el tema de la negociacin con ETA con fines, supongo, electorales. Ellos negociaron a escondidas y critican que otro negocie a la luz del da, con el mandato del parlamento y la aprobacin judicial. Dicen que se estn haciendo concesiones polticas, pero nunca han sabido citar una. Utilizan de una manera asquerosa el dolor y la rabia de las victimas (ayudados por los dirigentes de algunas de sus asociaciones).     Me temo que no quieren que Zapatero se apunte el "tanto" de lograr el final del terrorismo, aunque ste ya ha dejado muy claro que si se consigue ser un logro del trabajo consecutivo de todos los gobiernos desde la transicin. Estn boicoteando unas negociaciones, un proceso dialctico complejo pero decidido, que puede hacer que en Espa?a, despus de ms de un siglo, deje de haber muertos por motivos ideolgicos y todas las opiniones puedan ser, y sean efectivamente, defendidas con la palabra. Es imperdonable. Como es imperdonable que afirmen que la poltica del PSOE la marca ETA y aprovechen el homenaje a una vctima para publicar un vdeo ignominioso con la imagen de la serpiente de ETA rodeando a la rosa socialista. Asqueroso. Me admira que los socialistas, encabezados por Zapatero, mantengan una relativa calma y "talante" ante tanta bazofia y tanta mezquindad que tienen que escuchar todos los das.|`|9ed682487b16ae80ebbc5321ef6d832faa	Pienso que es un simple.

Con respecto al tema ETA, parece que nadie se acuerda cuando poco despus del vil asesinato de Miguel Angel Blanco, el Sr. Aznar sali hablando por la tele de que iban a tener conversaciones con los "Grupos Vascos de Liberacin Nacional", en lugar de decir "con los terroristas asesinos de ETA" y nadie  lo critic. ?y ahora se rasgan como locos las vestiduras porque Zapatero quiere buscar la paz igual que hizo Aznar!

2253307a6cde390091d89f22e97b600daa	Another hard question.  Probably due to their shared belief that socialism isn't an appropriate method of government.  I believe many who feel this way have confused socialism and communism, which are distinctly different.    Lets make it simple by using a stereotypical example:  The average conservative is likely invested in, let's say, pharmeceutical companies.  If we socialize prescription drugs (because every citizen will need them at some time), the government will want to negotiate a "fair" price since our tax money will foot the bill.  This will cause the pharm invested conservative to receive a much smaller payback from his investment.  A simple matter of greed in this case.|`|cb638eab09cb3998de012f079572d69aaa	Because they are greedy and resent anybody but themselves receiving.  Rich  conservatives accept  'welfare for the rich' in tax subsidies etc. but resent welfare for the "lazy' needy.  They think it is ok for some poor slob to work two ,or even three,  minimum -wage jobs  while they get huge salaries for networking over $200 lunches.  The Christian conservatives resent the "welfare cheats", the unwed mothers etc because they have decided they are NOT their 'brothers' keepers.   I am continually amazed at how UN-Christlike most Christians are.  "Judge not lest ye be judged" seems to be lost on the Bible-belters.  Jesus was a liberal but somehow the conservatives think he is ONLY on their  side.  Conservatives in general are simply greedy and hatefilled people.|`|AA12010393	Social programs mean bigger government.  Conservatives want a much smaller government.  It's all retarded anyway.

Think about it...none of them are run efficiently, the people who need it the most are only getting a portion of it, and the rest goes to fund yet another bureacracy.  American citizens give more money to charities than any other country's citizens.  And those programs, like the American Red Cross, do great things to help people in need, and are run like a business, where costs are watched, postions are down-sized if not needed, etc...  It should be mandatory to give to a charity (OUR choice), and let's not let the government try to run such important things.

I think the Iraqi people are the ones to decide their future not a brutal dictator or an outside power whether that be Iran, Syria or the U.S. If a majority of Iraqis wish to have Islam as a cornerstone of their government then who are we, in the West, to say that they are wrong.     The Sunnis also have to realize that their days as the elite class are over. They can either be part of the current governmental process or continue down the path of civil war. Some Iraqi Sunnis have to realize that "al-Qaeda in Iraq" is a cancer in their country and not worth any type of support. A similar decision is presented to the Shi'a militias as well. Are they a proxy of Iran or do they control their own destiny.|`|f140ae9af793503c74f7e3f978f7da87aa	Yes, no matter how bad Saddam was, Iraq was in a better condition post-2003 than it is now.

But at least in his time it was safe to walk the streets in the knowledge you wouldn't be blown up.    This is NOT hindsight. Everyone (at least everyone outside america) said before the war began, they're going to need a good plan for after the invasion otherwise it will end up in civil war, just like it has.

But, Bush had a vendetta and even said on his first day in office to his intimates that he was going to get Saddam because he had put out a contract on Bush's daddy.  He just used 9/11 as an excuse.  But, Bush, like Napolean, fancies himself as an empire-builder and we all know what happened to Napolean at Waterloo.  Iraq will turn out in the long run to be Bush's Waterloo if it hasn't already.  We have no more business there than we would in any other country - we can't be the world's policemen.|`|eee0be91b8aaee7bfca267f4beb3b16faa	it would've been cheaper both in dollars and in human life (on our side) but i guess you have to look at how many people would have died if we hadn't deposed him......its kinda up to you.|`|81a54a3afec3e38451b1ecfd4b52f2d4aa	Hindsight is 20/20.

I would strongly encourage you to research his background, his rise to power, and his impact on the Iraqi people. Then perhaps you would know better than to ask such a thing.    So many people in this world, especially Americans, just don't get it. They think Iraq was a peaceful place before Saddam was overthrown. Thousands of Iraqis were executed on a MONTHLY basis simply because Saddam suspected they may not be loyal to his regime. How is that okay? How is that anything short of terrorism???????? People were too afraid to speak against him because to speak against Saddam was to sign your own death warrant. And you people think that's being a good leader? That it's keeping things calm?????    Shame on you for being so full of ignorance and arrogance.|`|AA10956721	Well, "Stratman" doesn't know what a contraction is, so you can discount anything he has to say.  I believe that Saddam Hussein was an evil dictator. This made him a peer of about two-thirds of the national leaders on the planet.   The big mistake Saddam made was in believing Daddy Bush's "go ahead" on invading Kuwait. If he had been a tad more skeptical, none of the last 20 years of strife in the Persian Gulf region would have taken place.  So Dubya has a hard-on for the man that cost his papa re-election. So what else is new?  Saddam was a bastard, but so is Dubya, so is Kim Jung Il, so is Tony Blair, so are most of the national leaders on the planet. Just think about the kind of individual who would even set out to become a national leader ... is that someone you would want to spend any amount of time with? I think not.  Saddam deserved to be removed. Sure. So do a lot of tin-pot dictators and "presidents". Were we right to do it? I think not. Have we done a good job of it? I think not.  But that's just my opinion, and if you think differently, you can have sex with yourself at any time that is convenient to you.|`|AA12324350	Stratman--- woh don't use all of your intelligent in one sentence    Bleh--- why don't you ask a Iraqi citizen whether living under a vicious dictator or enjoying some of the rights you enjoy every day is better.    middlefinger--- you must like to be dominated by your man the way you talk.    Richard--- your right Saddam didn't have anything to do with 911 but he was a terrorist backer and he balked all the sanctions put on him because of his warmongering.

The Sunnis don't like the Shiites, the Shiites don't like the Sunnis, and neither likes the Kurds. That's why it takes a tyrant like Saddam Hussein to keep the lid on the violence. When Saddam Hussein was removed the US uncovered a hornets nest. Bush's subsequent incompetence wacked the hornets nest with a big stick.     Most of the crowd that posts here claiming removing Hussein was justified have forgotten or just never knew that the invasion of Iraq was supposed to be low-hanging fruit, a dry run before the real prize, Iran. We are stuck here in Iraq three years later with a civil war and American troops in the way. When President Bush says "Stay the course" he means "run out the clock until January 2009 and dump this mess on my successor."    The world is full of tinpot dictators like Saddam Hussein, most of whom control countries these armchair warriors who support Bush couldn't find on a map and never heard of or care about. Let Iraq split into three countries and let's get the hell out of that hellhole. It's not our fight.

Sono anni che mi domando perch mai, quale sar la causa dell'astio, della diffidenza e della prepotenza delle forze dell'ordine nei confronti dei cittadini. Ho trovato forse due o tre carabinieri gentili, che non mi hanno trattato dall'alto in basso, che non hanno cercato di spaventarmi o di farmi stare sulle spine. Della polizia non ho esperienza, ma dato che voglio credere che non dipenda da qualcosa insito nello specifico corpo armato (l'addestramento? E' un'ipotesi da brividi, la voglio scartare a priori), immagino sia lo stesso.    Ragazzi, io capisco che hanno armi, una divisa e devono tutelare la sicurezza e la legalit, che non sono l con il mitra (rendiamoci conto... li vedo a fare la spesa con il mitra a tracolla: posso capire la pistola, ma c***!!! Vi immaginate se cercano di fermare una macchina con il mitra?? Portiamoci dietro il gas nervino, gi che ci siamo!) senza motivo, per caspita: sono a servizio dello Stato e del cittadino, ho sempre pensato che dietro alla decisione di fare questo lavoro ci sia un senso di dedizione alla patria, una certa etica, degli ideali, no?  Invece sembra che il cittadino senza divisa, soprattutto se giovane e stravaccato su una panchina sia il nemico assoluto.    A me dispiace sentire le barzellette sui Carabinieri, ma soprattutto mi spiace sentire tanto livore contro tutte le forze armate (e non solo dai comunistelli delle superiori, che odiano ci che gli viene detto di odiare), anche perch generalizzare  SEMPRE sbagliato. Per, la maggior parte di loro, che cosa fa per dimostrare al cittadino un po' di disponibilit e di apertura mentale?

What you should have asked is "Why do citizens who don't agree with me (and therefore are wrong-minded) seem so mean or indifferent to MY viewpoint?"   The answer to that is to look within yourself and try to see your attitudes objectively.  To me, an independent, you appear at face value to be a narrow-minded, prejudiced and ill-informed person who casts a single blanket label over myriad people you don't want to bother investigating to find out what they really think, how they act and the fact that they each are distinct individuals with differing thoughts about various issues.

AA12319981	Ok, well you have two questions here, 1) we will become independent of oil when two things happen.  Number one, when we develop a viable alternate source of portable energy.  I personally think hydrogen burning engines are the next viable option and the most environmentally and economically sound idea.  It will also take vast changes in our infrastructure and energy planning.  We'll need alot more electricity to separate the hydrogen from he oxygen to burn, and burning fossil fuels won't cut it if we want to ween ourselves from the proverbial fossil fuel teet.  Nuclear power will be our most likely scenario and if planned correctly can be clean and economical.  2) I doubt we'll ever be completely separated from the Middle East.  We have too much vested in Israels well being and future, and it'll take to long to become disengaged from our oil addiction.  Besides, there are too many people in the US who support the US supporting Israel to disengage.  Besides, as long as we're a supper power, the world will look to us to take the initiative in international disputes.

G7SmEfLdaa	Yes I am happy we "are" through with George Bush.  However, luckily for us, we have just now started snowballing down the hill.    Obama is not going to stop this snowball of debt, he isn't going to end the Bush Doctrine of foreign policy, and he wants to expand the welfare state, by, creating more debt and inflating the currency, which will make the cost of things go up and create the need for MORE welfare. I don't understand his thought process.     How is he going to change anything by doing more of the same and allowing the snowball to get bigger and bigger?    EDIT: Protecting our country by attacking Afghanistan in Iraq when we have hundreds of illegal immigrants coming in right now.  Had we not intervened in Middle-eastern politics from the start, we would have saved ourselves from the many lives lost in 9/11, the soldiers lost in these two wars and all of the civilians lost in the war when terrorists were hiding amongst them.  I don't think it is too late to stop our intervention that has caused so much suffering, it would not be admitting defeat, in fact, it would be a fatal blow to the terrorists if we pull out, because "jihad" can only be construed if somebody is attacking you because of your religion.  If we stop attacking them, and supporting Israel who is attacking them.  then they can not within the bounds of their religion attack us on our own soil.|`|eu6UQElYaa	I'll be happy when Pelosi is gone.|`|1amF7oNwaa	WITH WHAT WE HAVE NOW, YOU ARE JOKING AREN'T YOU?|`|CpTQagJOaa	yes, you are wrong. you haven't seen anything yet.|`|bccc784e462841d316800601e52f1fb9aa	Yes!

Figlio di Alessandro, fabbro ferraio, e di Rosa Maltoni, maestra elementare, visse un'infanzia modesta. Studi nel collegio salesiano di Faenza (1892-93) e poi nel collegio Carducci di Forlimpopoli, conseguendo nel 1901 il diploma di maestro elementare. Quello stesso anno, in dicembre, viene assunto quale "supplente" nella scuola elementare di Pieve di Siliceto. Iscrittosi al Partito Socialista Italiano sin dal 1900, mostr subito un acceso interesse per la politica attiva stimolato tra l'altro dall'esempio del padre, esponente di un certo rilievo del socialismo anarcoide e anticlericale di Romagna. Emigrato in Svizzera (1902) per sottrarsi al servizio militare, entr in rapporto con Serrati, A. Balabanov e altri rivoluzionari, ponendo contemporaneamente le basi della propria cultura politica, in cui si mescolavano gli influssi di Marx, Proudhon e Blanqui insieme a quelli di Nietzsche e Pareto. Ripetutamente espulso da un cantone all'altro per il suo attivismo anticlericale e antimilitarista, rientr in Italia nel 1904 approfittando di un'amnistia che gli permise di sottrarsi alla pena prevista per la renitenza alla leva e comp il servizio militare nel reggimento bersaglieri di stanza a Verona. Ottenuta una supplenza a Caneva di Tolmezzo, il 17 febbraio del 1907 venne posto in congedo dai suoi superiori, dopo una sua anticlericale e rivoluzionaria commemorazione di Giordano Bruno. La Polizia lo sched come "sovversivo" e "pericoloso anarchico".       Dopo aver insegnato francese qualche tempo in una scuola privata a Oneglia (1908), dove collabor attivamente al periodico socialista "La lima" con lo pseudonimo di "Vero Eretico", torn a Predappio, dove si mise a capo dello sciopero dei braccianti agricoli. Il 18 luglio fu arrestato per aver minacciato un dirigente delle organizzazioni padronali. Processato per direttissima, fu condannato a tre mesi di carcere. Dopo 15 giorni  posto in libert provvisoria dietro cauzione. In settembre venne incarcerato per dieci giorni, per aver tenuto a Meldola un comizio non autorizzato.       Ricopr quindi la carica di segretario della Camera del Lavoro di Trento (1909) e diresse il quotidiano "L'avventura del lavoratore". Presto in urto con gli ambienti moderati e cattolici, dopo sei mesi di frenetica attivit propagandistica, non priva di successo, fu espulso anche da qui tra le proteste dei socialisti trentini, suscitando una vasta eco in tutta la sinistra italiana. Tornato a Forl, Mussolini si un, senza vincoli matrimoniali n civili n religiosi, con Rachele Guidi, la figlia della nuova compagna del padre e da essa ebbe, nel settembre 1910, la prima figlia Edda (Vittorio sarebbe nato nel 1916, Bruno nel 1918, Romano nel 1927, Anna Maria nel 1929, mentre nel 1915 sarebbe stato celebrato il matrimonio civile e nel 1925 quello religioso). Contemporaneamente la federazione socialista forlivese gli offriva la direzione del nuovo settimanale "Lotta di classe" e lo nominava proprio segretario. Nei tre anni in cui conserv tali incarichi, M. dette al socialismo romagnolo una sua impronta precisa, fondata su istanze rivoluzionarie e volontaristiche, ben lontane dalla tradizione razionale e positivista del marxismo cos come era interpretato dagli uomini pi rappresentativi del P.S.I.       Dopo il congresso socialista di Milano dell'ottobre 1910 ancora dominato dai riformisti, M. pens di scuotere la minoranza massimalista, anche a rischio di spaccare il partito, provocando l'uscita dal P.S.I. della federazione socialista forlivese, ma nessun altro lo segu nell'iniziativa. Quando sopraggiunse la guerra di Libia a mutare i rapporti di forza tra le correnti del socialismo italiano, M. (che del resto era stato condannato a un anno, poi ridotto a cinque mesi e mezzo, di reclusione per le manifestazioni organizzate in nel settembre del 1911 Romagna contro la guerra in Africa, trasformate in azioni rivoluzionarie di sabotaggio) apparve come l'uomo pi adatto a impersonare il rinnovamento ideale e politico del partito. Nel luglio del 1911 fu uno dei protagonisti del congresso di Reggio nell'Emilia: si pose alla testa degli intransigenti, deplorando i deputati che si erano congratulati con il Re per lo scampato pericolo e riuscendo ad ottenere l'espulsione dei "traditori". Assunse la direzione dell' Avanti! il 1 dicembre del 1912. Lo scoppio del conflitto mondiale lo trov   allineato sulle posizioni ufficiali del partito, di radicale neutralismo. Nel giro di qualche mese, tuttavia, in lui matur il convincimento - comune ad altri settori dell' "estremismo" di sinistra - che l'opposizione alla guerra avrebbe finito per trascinare il PSI a un ruolo sterile e marginale, mentre sarebbe stato opportuno sfruttare l'occasione offerta da questo sconvolgimento internazionale per far percorrere alle masse quella via verso il rinnovamento rivoluzionario dimostratasi altrimenti   impossibile. Dimessosi perci dalla direzione dell'organo socialista il 20 ottobre, due giorni dopo la pubblicazione di un articolo dal titolo chiaramente indicatore del suo mutato programma, "Dalla neutralit assoluta alla neutralit attiva ed operante", pens di realizzare un suo quotidiano. Il giorno dopo l'assemblea straordinaria del PSI milanese approv la linea propugnata da Mussolini. Ma la direzione nazionale la pensava diversamente. Il 15 novembre pertanto, M. accettando l'aiuto di un gruppo di finanziatori facenti capo a Filippo Naldi, pubblic "Il popolo d'Italia", ultranazionalista, radicalmente schierato su posizioni interventiste a fianco dell'Intesa e in grado di conseguire immediatamente un clamoroso successo di vendite. Espulso di conseguenza dal PSI (24-29 novembre 1914), nell'aprile del 1915 fu arrestato a Roma mentre si accingeva a presiedere un comizio interventista.

AA10844741	You simply cant expect from a devil/Beelzebub/Lucifer/Old Nick/Prince of Darkness/the Tempter/VOLDEMORT   to act like a dear person.  People can be recognized by their act.  Well, if those people think that, after killing people for 5 decades, after destroying land country and everything for 5 decades, and after you always behave like a stealer of your wealth, after attacking your religious belief such as coving up from top to bottom, beard, long dress, coverd head by cloths,    if they expect that arabs and muslims should tolerate this facist, let them to think.   If they now decide to change the defination of humanity,let them to change.  If they think that, its now time to change the defination of terrorist"and freedom fighter, let them to change.   You can chage a person's ill activity  if that person doesnt know what he/she is doing. But, you cant change a person who knows what he/she is doing ,aware of his/her activity, but, dont want to change the activity, because he/she is benfited by that activity.   Let them be benefited.  What you think, those people doesnt know about the reality in middle east? They know. What do you think, those people wont horrified if they think about the life and consequences in middle east. They know.   What do you think, why they called terrorists to people who want the right to live in their own country like others.But born and living in a hell, saw fire, bombing, crying, his dead dad/mom,sister, destroyed home, nothing to survive with? who is  raised watching US,Israelis attack , watching loosing home, tank, bomb, blood from the very beginning of their life, and now, watching to destroy a country in a moment, why they called this people terrorist?    Why they called freedom fighter when their ally,and they themsselves attack other country like a annimal in this 21st century, attack grab their country, ruling system, money, oil, everything ?  Yes.they simply have changed the defination too.   NOw, What can I and you do? Fight like freedom fighter or htey called these real freedom fighter according to "unchaged" defination, and be killed, or pray ,pray ,and pray without doing notihng?  Well, I dont know, what to do. They know what to do-to continue the war. because, it is obvious they will win as they have unlimited war equipments, ...well,, though they attack this iraq, lebanon, afganistan.. telling these country has enormous war equipment. well., they will also acknowledge that, whether they will destroy, finish a country and its people by telling lie, none have the ability to act against them.because they are now the most powerful war masters in this world.   And, those who think that, Thesse arabian are or will be benefited by that, will be , May your god will provide same benefit to you. And, excuse me, you cant blame me for my pray. Why you will?YOu people choose this way.After all, you have told that, whatever is happening becuase of peple's benefits. So , may you will enjoy the benefit too. Well, i dont know, whether you people will be "benefited"in the same way or not. But, one thing for sure, your given "benefit" is not welcome or expected by the arab world. And I hope, atleast this thing will match in your future receipt of "benefit"  And, Amgo, the logic is simple---rapaciousness. Israel is only  one agent of US and european nation in the arab world.  Why european are not completely supporting Israael,?because, they wont be as much benefited as US.And why they are not completely against Israel, Beacuse they will be benefited if Israel can capture arab.Arab means -"oil" , wealth to them.   And why many arab countries are quite now. Because, Us has already set its military base in Saudi arabia, so, saudi, and other arab countries cannot survive fighting with biggest VOLDEMORT in the world.  You, and I know why Israel is doing this. Its not only the greediness, but, their religious inspire them to do this things. Their religious says to obey the god, pray is not the only thing to do. Their church  believes in acquirig wealth .They beleive, in this world our purpose is to gain wealth centering church.  And, well, why here is all motivited people supporting inhumanity by US, Israel, find nothing wrong sending war equipment to Israel to destroy other arabs? What else those poor can do? they only hear Israelis voice, US voice. Those poor people are in lack of information. And afterall, they will regain by this capturing killing activity anyway.

hdcLCk8Faa	First of all it will grow jobs not at all. You must give businesses a reason to hire and this bill does nothing to address that. Secondly, tax cuts for tax payers is good, tax gifts to non-tax payers is called Welfare and not a Stimulus to anything but more Welfare payments. Thirdly, Obama has moved very little. He could have shut this "error in judgment" down but has let the loony left run wild and he now has zero creditability as related to any Stimulus plan.     My proposal. a.) Freeze Cap Gains tax for 2 years. b.) declare a tax holiday for all monies currently off shore/out of the US (currently about 19 Trillion) and have it brought back to the US to be used to self fund our deficits and provide investment capital to economic growth. c.) nothing is spent that is not 100% fully US manufactured and installed by Legal US Citizens and US based companies d.) Cut Spending in the Federal Budget by 10% across the board for 2 years e.) Scrap the current Tax system and install the Flat Tax.     There are many more but this space does not provide the forum to do it, but the above would be a start.|`|6nS62bB8aa	You are mistaken.

AA10078866	Hezbollah is an organization that took a parent from the Iranian revolutionary guards and have the same idealogy as Iranians. If you read about them, and be informed correctly about them you see that Hezbollah is not a terrorist group, and is simply a resistant group, and helps in the reconstruction of Lebanon. Iran supports them in their goal. This is a lie that iran urged Hezbollah to take those hostages since Hezbollah didn't even start the war. If you had watched middle east closely before the crisis you would understand that the situation started when the Israeili barbars attacked Gazaa strip, to take down their democratic government.|`|AA10783313	Iran supplies the weapons to the Hezbollah organization|`|AA11856834	TRAINING, INTELLIGENCE and WEAPONS SUPPORT TO HIZBULLAH.|`|1ce06794987899969231b1ce15f40759aa	First of all, Israel isn't fighting Lebanon.

Iran is a terror nation. What do terrorists do? They hide behind innocent people, just like they're doing with the Lebanese. Oh, and not to mention Iran's president keeps saying that Israel doesn't deserve to exist, and should be abolished.

I think that individual rights folks should go international like the socialists/marxists have. Wouldn't that be a hoot? The Brits, the Irish, that French guy.....They exist in every country and I think it's time for an international "meeting at the docks".    >> Actually it does make sense, you just don't get it. The point is that socialist/marxists work on an international scale while those who are for individual liberty stay clustered in their own countries fending off the international marxist/socialist movements. Um, who do you think is winning? It's certainly not the libertarians. What's so hard to understand about that?|`|jyCdeAtNaa	Honestly, very few Americans think about this stuff.  People do not stand against an established order unless there is another established order to stand with and they are absolutely forced to make a decision.  In the American, French and October revolutions, the imperial governments had essentially collapsed already and were no longer able to feed their veteran soldiers, which comprised a large portion of the urban population.  There was very little formidable resistance to the fascist governments of the 30's.  The scale of urban population and destructiveness of modern weaponry make resistance futile because the disturbance would destroy the delicate balance of urban survival.  Therefore, the only weapon is economics.  Modern resistance to a government absolutely will not reach critical mass until the economic system, despite it's best effort, is unable to support the government in question, at which point physical resistance becomes irrelevant.  The fall of the Soviet Union is a good example of this. The pending fall of China will be another.  These took more than 50 years.  How long do you want to wait?|`|lHJlwuqBaa	Hopefully, there are still enough conservatives and Republicans with enough intestinal fortitude to resist all the pork, earmarks and entitlements Mr. O., Barney Frank and Nancy Pelosi are trying to ram through congress and down our throats!

The worst day in a representative democracy like the USA has, is better than the best day in a Socialist dictatorship!

hM6KK5iJaa	A cut in their salaries alone wouldn't make a dent but at least it would be a gesture.  Let's remove their dining rooms, cafeterias, health clubs, and all the other crap-ola we're paying for.  And this is just the icing on the cake:    Today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats in Congress left town for their annual retreat at Kingsmill Resort and Spa in nearby Williamsburg, Va., which offers "unforgettable golf, luxurious accommodations... and an abundance of recreational opportunities."     And before anyone screams that the Republicans just had a retreat, yes they did, but we're not paying for it:    "Republicans spend no public money on their retreat...Democrats spend taxpayer money on their retreat but do not permit lobbyists to accompany them. The public pays for a charter train from Washington to Williamsburg for many of the 200 members who attend, as well as conference rooms, security and catering."    I'm sick of the entire bunch and it's only been a couple of weeks.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Because few of them on either side of the aisle truly care about the people they work for -- us.

You are right on the huge sum a country can save by giving a small contribution from everyone. The executives would rather come up with a package for the salaried class against the increased price instead of a pay cut.  Your suggestion should be heard by all major MNC's in India as well.|`|YnWrmVd1aa	I disagree with this line of reasoning.  George Washington initially offered to serve as the first U.S. President for free.  He later decided that it wasn't a good precedent because it shouldn't be a requirement that one is already wealthy prior to running for office.  Think about it.  In order to become a representative, you actually have to win an election, give up all of your privacy, open your personal life to vicious attacks by your opponent, and potentially quit your day job while you are in the process of campaigning.  We have enough wealthy elitists in congress as it is.  The last thing we need is a change in policy that would make it impossible for working professionals to run for office.  By the way, 39, 590, 000 doesn't even buy one jet for the military.  That particular change in policy would not help with the budget deficit at all.

AA11494150	Hepatitis is probably the most common disease you will come in contact with, but you will receive vaccinations which substantially reduce the risk.     Being a sharpshooter, or becoming a member of SWAT will be determined by the department.

The selection process will vary by department.|`|4t2kd03Waa	Forget the disease. Wear rubber gloves if the situation warrants it.      Move up to sharp shooter? You can apply for the SWAT team after you prove yourself as a good reliable officer.

d60812b54bd94ed9b890bbc6003e6400aa	Start by contesting the debt with "third party."  (The letter will tell you how to do that.)  Simply state that you have fulfilled your end of the settlement agreement with "company," and believe this matter to be resolved.  Send them a copy, and a copy of your proof of payment.    If you hear back from them, you can go from there, but I wouldn't worry just yet about criminal charges.    To be safe, never discuss with anyone (except your attorney) how the debt was incurred.    Good luck.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	Criminal cases give you criminal records. Civil cases do not. That's why they have different names. It is possible to have both Criminal and Civil cases against you for a single incident though.|`|z88IMXNFaa	A criminal record? No.  Charge with a crime?  Yes.  If you go into court and admit to committing crimes, the judge can refer the matter to the prosecutor who can then charge you and your confession is on the record.|`|HpJ4wwC7aa	They're totally separate cases. You  don't get charged criminally unless the DA files charges.    But if you settled it civilly and have a signed settlement agreement, I would think that would be the end of it. Sounds like they're trying to extort money out of you, aka black mail. That is illegal as well.|`|mwEBrwlOaa	You need to look closely at your agreement and how damages are defined. The company may have charged you interest, fees, and other things like loss of income. It may be you have been charged for things that are not your responsibility to pay back. Right now the best thing you can do is hire an attorney and understand your rights. If you do not you may find that you are in 'over your head' and it may come back to haunt you.     Moving on if you have an attorney they can help you ensure that you are not charged, provided that is the agreement you had with the company. The judge cannot give you a criminal record without due process but they can refer the matter to the District Attorney's office for for further investigation. If the District Attorney decides to investigate it could be you are then charged. So it is a good idea to get an attorney. Finally even if the company has agreed not to report the matter to the police there is nothing that can stop them at a later date going to the police. In all honesty you need an attorney.

I do believe if your having trouble having a child. It is ok to go for Inverto  when you don't have any children. To seek Inverto have already have six children.Well the doctor and all who had anything to do with it  should loose there license .  An not allowed to practice medicine again. This is a abuse of the medical aid and services meant to help people who are having a hard time having children. It is not meant to start a freak show for personal gain. No one should be able to do this . the second Inverto should have never been done..

PRI is the historically dominant centrist party, analagous to the DNC in the US or Labor in the UK.
mwEBrwlOaa	A public health care system is much better. In the UK all prescriptions including cancer, orphan drugs, and drugs for HIV/AIDs are about $10. Also in the UK hospitalization, doctor's visits, and medical tests are free too. Thirdly medications unless they are over-the-counter cannot be advertised in the UK. Finally in the UK most non-emergency treatment requires a time to wait and it means less surgery.     America is based on a consumer driven economy which has un-necessarily driven up the price of health care to the point where it is unreachable for many people. If the US is to make health care public like the mail and transport then it will mean taxes. Also it will mean Americans will have to learn to wait and health care companies will have less direct access to the public. For me I believe public health care is the way to but I do not believe America is capable of making the transition to a public system.|`|tu2VbI0zaa	I think a better system is private health care, because it allows for price and service competition...over time people will stop going to those who can't provide quality or timely service...and that's how the market works...    While the idea of national health care may be very appealing, the reality of it, is that costs go down, but far worse the quality and availability goes down as well...    There are major bad consquences to national health care, and there are better ways of improving it, rather than nationalizing it.
IcBdShB1aa	marijuana for medical purposes is fine, but for the general public will always be illegel.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Yes, but with strict regulation.

The Government right now has a very tight leash on us. They do not currently see a way to get financial gains on weed so they ban it. I personally have seen a lot of good from hemp, besides smoking it. I also know Cancer patients and people with chronic back pain and I see a difference when they are "Under the influence." My thought as well as a lot of other fellow smokers "Get the hell out of America and I will see you in Amsterdam."

AA11836472	PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 603   December 10, 1974  THE CHILD AND YOUTH WELFARE CODE      I, FERDINAND E. MARCOS, President of the Philippines, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby order and decree the following:       TITLE I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES      Article 1.  Declaration of Policy. - The Child is one of the most important assets of the nation. Every effort should be exerted to promote his welfare and enhance his opportunities for a useful and happy life.   The child is not a mere creature of the State. Hence, his individual traits and aptitudes should be cultivated to the utmost insofar as they do not conflict with the general welfare.     The molding of the character of the child start at the home. Consequently, every member of the family should strive to make the home a wholesome and harmonious place as its atmosphere and conditions will greatly influence the child's development.     Attachment to the home and strong family ties should be encouraged but not to the extent of making the home isolated and exclusive and unconcerned with the interests of the community and the country.     The natural right and duty of parents in the rearing of the child for civic efficiency should receive the aid and support of the government.     Other institutions, like the school, the church, the guild, and the community in general, should assist the home and the State in the endeavor to prepare the child for the responsibilities of adulthood.     Art. 2. Title and Scope of Code. - The Code shall be known as the "Child and Youth Welfare Code". It shall apply to persons below twenty-one years of age except those emancipated in accordance with law. "Child" or "minor" or "youth" as used in this Code, shall refer to such persons.     Art. 3. Rights of the Child. - All children shall be entitled to the rights herein set forth without distinction as to legitimacy or illegitimacy, sex, social status, religion, political antecedents, and other factors.     (1) Every child is endowed with the dignity and worth of a human being from the moment of his conception, as generally accepted in medical parlance, and has, therefore, the right to be born well.   (2) Every child has the right to a wholesome family life that will provide him with love, care and understanding, guidance and counseling, and moral and material security.     The dependent or abandoned child shall be provided with the nearest substitute for a home.     (3) Every child has the right to a well-rounded development of his personality to the end that he may become a happy, useful and active member of society.     The gifted child shall be given opportunity and encouragement to develop his special talents.     The emotionally disturbed or socially maladjusted child shall be treated with sympathy and understanding, and shall be entitled to treatment and competent care.     The physically or mentally handicapped child shall be given the treatment, education and care required by his particular condition.     (4) Every child has the right to a balanced diet, adequate clothing, sufficient shelter, proper medical attention, and all the basic physical requirements of a healthy and vigorous life.     (5) Every child has the right to be brought up in an atmosphere of morality and rectitude for the enrichment and the strengthening of his character.     (6) Every child has the right to an education commensurate with his abilities and to the development of his skills for the improvement of his capacity for service to himself and to his fellowmen.     (7) Every child has the right to full opportunities for safe and wholesome recreation and activities, individual as well as social, for the wholesome use of his leisure hours.     (8) Every child has the right to protection against exploitation, improper influences, hazards, and other conditions or circumstances prejudicial to his physical, mental, emotional, social and moral development.     (9) Every child has the right to live in a community and a society that can offer him an environment free from pernicious influences and conducive to the promotion of his health and the cultivation of his desirable traits and attributes.     (10) Every child has the right to the care, assistance, and protection of the State, particularly when his parents or guardians fail or are unable to provide him with his fundamental needs for growth, development, and improvement.     (11) Every child has the right to an efficient and honest government that will deepen his faith in democracy and inspire him with the morality of the constituted authorities both in their public and private lives.     (12) Every child has the right to grow up as a free individual, in an atmosphere of peace, understanding, tolerance, and universal brotherhood, and with the determination to contribute his share in the building of a better world.    Art. 4. Responsibilities of the Child. - Every child, regardless of the circumstances of his birth, sex, religion, social status, political antecedents and other factors shall:   (1) Strive to lead an upright and virtuous life in accordance with the tenets of his religion, the teachings of his elders and mentors, and the biddings of a clean conscience;   (2) Love, respect and obey his parents, and cooperate with them in the strengthening of the family;     (3) Extend to his brothers and sisters his love, thoughtfulness, and helpfulness, and endeavor with them to keep the family harmonious and united;     (4) Exert his utmost to develop his potentialities for service, particularly by undergoing a formal education suited to his abilities, in order that he may become an asset to himself and to society;     (5) Respect not only his elders but also the|`|c7253e20cf1ab68e19a8a973654c6ca8aa	That's the "Child and Youth Welfare Code"

With our mastery of CGI and editing, this would not be hard to do and the world would believe it too.|`|a8935c53189ecd93f664d61a88ccf184aa	Stop enacting foreign policy that is excusivley self-serving and isolationist.|`|06a5ad6022eb8b3e8bf0872d581c3064aa	Fighting terror is a compicated game. It would be the same as telling christians to stop there religion. To terrorists what they are doing is (in thier mind) good, these people value death and think it is good. Even today they teach there children to hate us. The only thing we can do is to keep them as far away as possible to us.|`|64d29aeb38105bd9bf6761caa4732583aa	Convert, or die.

Or whatever they think their going, and that's nowhere fast.  I love blowing things up!|`|AA12382591	Well you ask a question that I'm not so sure has any right answer.... but here is my opinion....    First and foremost you have to keep beating down thier doors.  They hate having us in Iraq or anywhere in the Middle East.  If we don't, they will envelope the entire region worse than what has already happened... the alternative... we could fight them here.    Second... the media has to work more closely in understanding that this isn't a purely political issue... I don't care who the President is when it comes to terrorists... There are alot of things in the press that shouldn't be.  I support the Constitution, but what what cost in letting intel and BS loose in the media.  Look at what happened to Gerraldo Rivera....     Third.... BORDER SECURITY... enough said    Fourth... follow the money.... without it they are limited for weapons and movement    Fifth .... We have to have sustainable international policy and yes, that include Israel and Palestine.    Now how do deny them thier cause??  We can't. Yes it is that simple.  Radical Fundamentalist will always find a way to make someone else the villian.  It gives credibility to thier cause. No matter what position we take on anything dealing with the Middle East we will continue to lose... they have been fighting in the region for thousands of years and that won't change anytime soon. Until they realize the full implications of globalization and geo-economics, there will not be signifcant change in the Middle East.  Once Kuwait, Bahrain and Quatar did, they changed alot of thier policies and ways of doing things. They are moving or have moved to the middle ground and they are continuing to make progress.    Okay... I'm done now.... lol.|`|AA12322868	All it takes is to stop reporting it on the news or just get it off the TV.    Pretty simple...|`|df0283826914377221052986770e71a1aa	The key word here is BUSINESS! If you want to stop them, cut off their financing by criminally prosecuting everyone who gives so much as a dime to further any terrorist cause.
AA11134857	I thought the fact that he is Howard Dean was enough proof that he's a bad choice.|`|AA11449024	Your question will back fire given that the choice of the Repubican to lead the nation and free world says things like....     Gynocologist " aren't able to practice their, their love with women all across this country." ...    I could go on...many many many more examples.    Which is why if word choice is the critira for determing bad leadership, then you acknolwede by defualt Bush is a bad choice to lead the nation.....      Dean says what he says, doesn't make him wrong...  regardless of how sensitive you are he still made his point.      MATTHEWS: Would you have ever thought of her as a possible court nominee?    DEAN: No.  You know, she's a person who's very much below the radar screen as the president's legal counsel.  But there's a lot of questions.  I do think the president should make sure the Senate knows about her positions that she took while she was the president's legal counsel because it's the only documentation that we're going to have about what she believes.    MATTHEWS: Do you believe that the president can claim executive privilege?    DEAN: Well, certainly the president can claim executive privilege.  But in the this case, I think with a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court, you can't play, you know, hide the salami, or whatever it's called.  He's got to go out there and say something about this woman who's going to a 20 or 30-year appointment, a 20 or 30-year appointment to influence America.  We deserve to know something about her.|`|8ef75c9b9df9efaf0b5a25982bb11ecaaa	LOL i think howard dean plays hide the salami with rush limbaugh|`|AA11327015	I think a classless piece of crap is the best person to run you group of losers.

But just another faux paux.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	LOL, Howard Dean cracks me up..   But I didn't need to know that he said that to think he was a bad choice.

Harold Ford for pres...|`|c0933722994ded8a8d57655e9f87882caa	LOL    I didn't know about this! That is so funny, but I am not surprised by the source.

They are.|`|9ba5caeebc10589ebfc50621b461ecccaa	The North Koreans have nuclear capability   Thanks in part too former president billy Clinton!  As for a delivery system for them too accurately hit America I am sure they will probably have that some time after 2008 if one of them dumb *** democrat es get into office!|`|AA10430790	Yes. President Bill Clinton signed an agreement with the North Korean government giving the North Koreans the technology & materials to begin a nuclear program. These materials were used to make a "light water works".  This is the first step creating a nuclear processing facility. In return for accepting this technology, the North Korean government promised not to make nuclear weapons, the United States government agreed not to audit, inspect or intrude on the Korean nuclear program. This program has cost the American taxpayers over $800 million. information about the program is contained in US government budget documents & news articles from several years ago. The presidential administration & media, at the time,  hailed the agreement as a "major breakthrough". Those materials are now being used to make weapons grade material. That's why so many countries are now upset.|`|3a20cafc6d378796cf24b48eb003dff4aa	we have them, russia has them, france have them, the FRENCH kid the french SO OF COURSE THEY HAVE THEM|`|02cb534162cb12472bcd91e382055717aa	I wouldnt doubt it..I was stationed near the DMZ and its still on high alert there...

Most contracts have clauses that allow for nullification, but the best way to get the answer to that question would be to contact the State Attourney's General Office|`|AA11142237	Check with the Ohio Attorney General.  Most states have some kind of buyers remorse law, but you should check with them to see what Ohio's law is.|`|22bd6b896ae9c7f8112d9121f4f62283aa	No matter what the dealer says, There is a 72 hour law on any contract. If they try to cheat you or keep some of your money, Take,em to court.|`|5c08618a175037ab751d84002a275e50aa	If the sale is done at your home or office you do have a reversal period but if your transaction took place at the dealership the contract is binding.  Some manufacturers now offer a return policy. For example, Chrysler's new employee discount offer includes a 72 hour period where you can change your mind. There is a catch though.....if you change your mind there is a restock fee that you must pay - 5% of the MSRP (window sticker on the vehicle). Seems awful high, doesn't it.|`|623241ef0fccc2881fa444ccf55b7a96aa	I think you have 30 days to change your mind. You might call the Better Business Bureau in your town to make sure.

There are tons of unemployed and underemployed Americans in technical, IT, engineering, and manufacturing fields because their jobs were outsourced.  We frequently see news of companies laying off another thousands of jobs and closing manufacturing plants.  In the meantime, we buy more and more goods because our population is growing.  We should force our government to stop allowing this.

e4f052c54178dcafa27ef36fa19dd37caa	Que l'on soit d'accord ou non, il y a dj des rgles : l'ONU amis en place un trait de non-prolifration (TNP) : les 5 pays disposant de l'arme nuclaire (France, RU, USA, Chine, Russie) s'engagent  rduire leur arsenal, et les pays non quips et signataires du trait s'engagent  ne pas tenter d'acqurir l'arme nuclaire.     Quant  savoir si ce procd est juste et quitable, on peut bien s?r en douter : il installe un rapport dominant/domin, et interdit l'accs au nuclaire aux pays mergents, notamment. Mais le TNP instaur en 1970 tait plus que ncessaire, dans un contexte mondial pour le moins tendu, sur fond d'affrontement entre les deux blocs.    A l'vidence la raison voudrait que tous les pays se dbarrassent de l'arme nuclaire, mais la menace du terrorisme religieux, par exemple, ne favorise pas le dmantlement gnral.     Aujourd'hui, personne ne dcide "que tel ou tel pays a le droit de possder l'arme nuclaire", elle est tout simplement interdite  ceux qui ne l'ont pas encore, avec des exceptions (Inde, par ex) qui dpendent d'accords stratgiques.     Pour finir, l'volution du nuclaire dans le monde dpend de l'Agence Internationale pour l'Energie Atomique (AIEA), instance cense tre indpendante, qui a obtenu le prix Nobel de la Paix en 2005, et qui est rpute pour faire un excellent travail, dans des conditions difficiles.|`|AA10370161	A mon avis, quoi quon rponde, la ralit est : Oncle Sam dcide encore pendant quelques annes, aprs ?a sera un plus le bordel quand la Chine, puis lInde, doubleront les US en tant que puissance conomique.|`|ebba1f8d8120f57bff4364d560aa7ce0aa	le pire est que tous les armes sont illegal non pas seulement l'arme nuclaire|`|ebe20ca715182e5dc861f844841b7152aa	je ne sais pas mais ce qui est sur c que USA n'a pas le droit de dcider    car on a vu les rsultats ... que des guerres|`|ee1d154e0a389baf708f29e91a723d55aa	israel|`|cd852c96d61e404844b17b67676ef301aa	Mon avis perso : tout le monde devrait l'avoir, comme ?a personne n'oserait plus s'en prvaloir.

Esta lei foi regulamentada pelo Decreto no 59.820, de 20/12/66. Formado por depsitos mensais, efetuados pelas empresas em nome de seus empregados, no valor equivalente ao percentual de 8% das remunera??es que lhes s?o pagas ou devidas; em se tratando de contrato temporrio de trabalho com prazo determinado, o percentual  de 2%, conforme disp?e o inciso II do art. 2o da Lei no 9.601, de 21/01/98.    Atualmente, a Lei que disp?e sobre o FGTS  a de no 8.036, de 11/05/90, republicada em 14/05/90, j tendo sofrido vrias altera??es.    O Fundo constitui-se em um peclio disponibilizado quando da aposentadoria ou morte do trabalhador, e representa uma garantia para a indeniza??o do tempo de servi?o, nos casos de demiss?o imotivada.    A diferen?a bsica em rela??o ao modelo anterior  que esses depsitos integram um Fundo unificado de reservas, com contas individualizadas em nome dos trabalhadores.    Alm de ampliar o direito indenizatrio do trabalhador, que pode, ao final do tempo til de atividade, contar com o valor acumulado dos depsitos feitos em seu nome, o sistema tambm o favorece de forma indireta, ao proporcionar as condi??es necessrias  forma??o de um Fundo de aplica??es, voltado para o financiamento de habita??es, assim como para investimentos em saneamento bsico e infra-estrutura urbana.    Como conseqncia, este mecanismo tambm proporciona a gera??o de empregos na constru??o civil, bem como possibilita aos trabalhadores ganhos indiretos decorrentes da amplia??o da oferta de moradias.    Com o novo sistema, o encargo adicional gerado para as empresas, por ocasi?o da implanta??o do sistema, foi de apenas 2,8%, j que a contribui??o de 8% para o FGTS foi compensada com a extin??o de outras contribui??es at ent?o existentes. Deve-se ressaltar, ainda, o fato de que a contribui??o para o FGTS guarda proporcionalidade com a indeniza??o prevista na CLT, permitindo, assim, que a empresa efetive a cobertura parcelada da indeniza??o a que teria direito o trabalhador, quando de seu desligamento. Esse aspecto pode ser considerado, tambm, como um benefcio para o empregador.      Todos os trabalhadores regidos pela CLT a partir de 05/10/88. Antes dessa data o direito ao FGTS era opcional. Tambm tm direito ao FGTS os trabalhadores rurais, os temporrios, os avulsos, os safreiros e os atletas profissionais (jogadores de futebol, por exemplo).    O diretor n?o empregado poder ser equiparado aos demais trabalhadores sujeitos ao regime do FGTS.     facultado ao empregador domstico recolher ou n?o o FGTS ao seu empregado.

cba1dfd11bfa0d7abc2f4ed943fe04baaa	I've wondered about that, too.  But then celebrities want the media attention and good press their "charity work" gives them.    I think this applies to our own Government as well.  We have poured BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of dollars into Iraq, but where is there any legislation helping our own citizens.  Bush has CUT approrpriations in Medicare, Medicaid and forced this lousy Meicare Part D prescription plan on citizens, many who cannot afford the price of the medications - plus they have to pay to get this "service".  By the way, it was Denny Hastert who came up with this brilliant prescription plan and all of the puppets in Congress went along with it.  I don't see any Republican political leaders in government worried about our own country as much as they are in covering their butts and trying to get the same religious groups to vote for them again this year (let's not worry about our country or our citizens or even the war in Iraq - let's work on "no flag burning", "spending lotsa time on the "Pledge of Allegiance", and golly gee - I'm sure we're all just brimming with excitement about banning gay marriage.

In addition,we could pay teachers what they  deserve.

This is why the kindness of liberals is considered to be far better even at the risk that a few liberal think the world should provide them everything.|`|AA11746917	The poor in the USA do receive all of those things. It's called welfare, and millions of Americans benefit from it. They receive, food stamps, medical care, and  public housing. As a matter of fact, the welfare system provides such a comfortable lifestyle, lots of people see no need to go get a job.|`|AA11321824	It's because the republican Neocon Fascists are in power. They could care less about the little guy, or health care or reason for that matter. It's all about who has the most power and wealth to them.    This country has become so right wing conservative that if it goes any farther that way we will be calling W Heir Furer. They don't give a crap about anything humanitarian. Has W ever done anything to help the down troden, ever? He and his neo-fascists are never going to.    Even Nixon tried to bring national health care to this country. Every other major country in the world has national health care. We are the richest so why don't we? We don't because we spend more money on weapons, the military and defense than ALL the other nations of the world combined.    That's pitiful...

d9c9e60dd51696e96dedd6c890e01055aa	Beh io sono stato, per la durata del militare, dalla parte di chi state "giudicando" e vorrei esporre a tutti quanti la mia esperienza.    Io mi sono trovato molto bene ed ho fatto un'esperienza unica ma, lo dico per essere onesto, non ho continuato perch ci sono delle logiche interne che a me non andavano bene e poi ho studiato per fare dell'altro.    Come in tutte le aggregazioni di persone, ci sono i cretini, su questo non ci piove; ma non bisogna ragionare sugli estremi altrimenti tutti i discorsi cadono.    Ho visto gente che mette a repentaglio la vita per 2 lire ... 2 lire, credetemi ... magari "solo" per aiutare un'altra persona.    Uno dei problemi  che se muore Carlo, i giornali scrivono "Morto Carlo" .. se muore un agente, i giornali scrivono "Morto Agente".    Per evitare che qualche beota violento (e non ho detto tifoso che  un'altra cosa!) faccia casino allo stadio si arriva 4 ore prima e si rientra 4 ore dopo ... 11 ore di servizio per 90 minuti di pallone ... ma stiamo scherzando ... la sicurezza deve essere garantita, lo capisco, ma nelle strade per evitare incidenti e reati e non al chiuso in una struttura sportiva dove la gente dovrebbe essere CIVILE.    Siccome la GENTE non  civile ma il singolo si, bisogna andare dove la GENTE si esprime con la massima irrazionalit .. la violenza.    Se allo stipendio ridicolo aggiungiamo le ferie decise da altri e non pianificabili, gli straordinari non pagati, le attrezzature vecchie e a volte non a norma o inadeguate, la pericolosit della GENTE e dei servizi in generale, i vari politici da scortare, la pericolosit di contrarre qualche malattia a contatto con gentaccia ... direi che non  un bel lavoro; tuttavia regalo loro tutta la stima di cui dispongo e che meriterebbe da ogni cittadino perch  facile dire "che stronzo mi ha dato la multa" e poi "grazie di aver preso i ladri entrati a casa mia"!    Visto che la domanda  stata fatta nella sezione politica aggiungerei anche che grazie ai tagli effettuati dal governo Berlusconi (prima il problema non c'era) non c' abbastanza benzina per coprire tutto il territorio; questo  uno scandalo.    In merito al video, trovo non sia corretto usare la violenza ma alcune persone capiscono solo quella (e poi non basta nemmeno quella) ma vorrei farvi una domanda ... ma se il "delinquente" avesse stuprato vostra sorella o fratello o avesse ammazzato un vostro caro amico ... cambierebbe il modo di vedere quel video?

f661f9f80329f8e36add6bd99f25cc5eaa	They "Chose" themselves. Perhaps that's the reason. The entire notion of a "Chosen" people is moronic.|`|AA11594675	Historically, the "Chosen People" were chosen by God to deliver his heavenly message to all human kind, but look at his message now after thousands of years, it's been mutated into religious enterprise among them and segregated humans to Goys and non-Goys. So, if I am correct, there isn't chosen people anymore, because the monopoly on Gods word was ended by God himself with updated books and messengers who crossed the borders of only one tribe and/or ethnicity.     So, when you run a piece of exclusive religious propaganda, I think people of other faiths will hate you for logical reasons, not dogmatic.|`|8a59c70639a4c28c0138f5d713aa0d44aa	Hold on just a minute please. The chosen was the Jews back in History in the Bible Moses and AAron were sent to free them for they were slaves to Pharoh. Ok God put plaglues on the people of Pharoh. Grasshoppers, or locusts, All the fish died because God turned the rivers to blood. Frogs, read the old testiment about Moses. It will tell you what you need to know concerning the History. The chosen were to get the land of milk and honey. Yes they wondered in the desert for 40 years. They finally saw it and was able to go there. They were still bickering about one thing or something else in the desert and God fed them and kept them safe. Now for some reason every body wants what they got. They have oil on their land of milk and honey, So they fight to protect what God gave them. I am not going any further then this right now. I just thought I would give you a little more history with out preaching. The apostles and desciples were hated too they are God's people. Any time there is good then evil tries to destroy it. Lightness is always over darkness we don't always see it that way. Good does over come evil keep faith. There is truly a light side and a dark side. Light side is full of God's love perfect love casteth out all evil. Dark side leads to hate, lies, doubt, fear and is against love. If we can't learn to love our selves first then we will never learn to love our neighbor. I am not judging any one here. Please don't believe I am trying to do that.  God's people or the chosen remembering Christians no matter what nationality are His chosen we will be hated prosecuted for His name's sake but in the end we will have victory eternal life LOVE in heaven. Maybe this answered why the chosen people are hated is only because Satin hates God. Satin hates God's people as well. Not everyone is God's people some are actually anti christ which does not mean they don't believe in God. Anti christ means not of Christ. Again I am not judging any one I am explaining that this comes from Satin and his followers. Yes Satin has worshipers too just like God does. God loves and Satin Hates. Did that help you with out further confusing you? I hope so. There are some people out there that don't know if God is real or not? They're seeking. I am sure there are those that are seeking answers about Satin too. So see not every one is for God are necessary wanting to be Christians but they don't necessarily want to be Satin's people either. That is why we must be very careful and not judge one another.|`|fccd971d9ba75483be22baf437d89a10aa	I hate no one!|`|d30e1434ac62b8a1509898775917bdf2aa	Help me George--- Who are the Chosen people??

3751a4b1d4b23b35720ed11a646c06ddaa	Our freedom is being taken away in giant swaths and the patriot act had much to add to it .We have had laws in place for years in which terrorists when caught could be dealt with properly . We see so many tactics now to frighten the american people out of their rights in the name of a fight on terrorism it's become daily news. And the mere name of it the patriot act , WOW ! Who could argue with that without being branded a traitor? In both of his presidential campaigns, George W. Bush proclaimed he believed in the strict construction of the U.S. Constitution. In other words, if the Constitution doesnt say it, one cannot read a provision into it.   And, if the Constitution does say it, then the words used in it must be given their literal meaning. He made strict construction a litmus test for his appointment of judges to the federal bench.   However, Bush himself does not strictly construe the Constitution. He ignores those parts of it that limit what he, Vice President Dick Cheney and their advisers believe to be the presidents prerogatives.   The Federalist Papers, written contemporaneously with the U.S. Constitution, indicate that the drafters of our Constitution purposely decided not to put the powers of the chief executive in Article 1. They wanted to make a point of showing that the chief executive was not the primary authority in our new country, that he wasnt a monarch or dictator.   POWER-SHARING IS MANDATORY   The executive branch was to share power with two co-equal branches, the legislative and the judiciary. Article 1 would be reserved for those who would be closest to the citizens, the legislators.   It is to the Congress, not the executive branch, that our founders gave the power to lay and collect taxes, to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States, to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, to raise and support the armed forces and to declare war.   It is this first Article of the U.S. Constitution (Section 7) that describes how a bill becomes a law. Every bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the objections at large on their journal, and proceed to reconsider it.   It goes on to say, If any bill shall not be returned by the President within ten days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the same shall be a law, in like manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return, in which case it shall not be a law.   The president signs a bill, allows it to become law without signing it or vetoes it. The Constitution is clear and unambiguous about this.   Which brings me to a notion called a signing statement. This is a document appended by the president to a bill he signs. The president may not agree with the bill, but he doesnt veto it (which might be a bad political move); instead, he signs it and says he will set whatever limits on it he deems necessary, including not enforcing it at all.   STATEMENTS RARELY RELEASED   These signing statements are rarely made public. Although they have been used by presidents since at least Ronald Reagan, no president has used them as often, or in the same way, as President George W. Bush has. The U.S. Constitution has no provision for such a signing statement. These statements unconstitutionally allow the executive branch to interpret and apply a bill passed by Congress in ways that are contrary to the specific words, and intent, of Congress.   In recent Pentagon appropriation bills, there was a provision passed by Congress that disallowed use of federal funds for any intelligence gathering that violated the Fourth Amendment  Bush signed the bills but added a signing statement stating that the commander-in-chief had the right to collect intelligence in any way he deemed necessary.   So far, Bush has added a signing statement to 750 bills he has signed. He added one to the bill introduced by Sen. John McCain making the use of torture by U.S. forces illegal. After much discussion and dissension, and lobbying by Vice President Cheney against this bill, the Republican majority in Congress finally passed it. President Bush signed it into law.   But attached to it was a signing statement saying that the president reserved the right to allow torture when he felt it was in the best interests of national security.   Congress specifically had considered that exception and rejected it. Yet Bush refused to veto the bill. He simply signed it and then decided he would do what he, not Congress, thought wisest, the Constitution and its balance of powers be damned   SLIPPERY SLOPE TO TYRANNY   I trust no president of either party with that kind of power. I am afraid that if this goes unchecked, we are on the slippery slope to a dictatorship. Yet members of Congress of both parties, afraid of confronting controversy and jeopardizing their re-election, arent fighting back. They would rather seem to have power, to seem to do the right thing, than to have power and do the right thing.   How sad is that for us citizens?|`|d28de74e0fc0f52cbad15448ad310826aa	Yes, I do think that are freedom is being taken, but at chunks at a time.  And it concerns me a lot, because I don't want to live like the people had to live in Nazi Germany.  It would totally suck to have to live in a police state.  I would rather take my chances with the terrorist then with the gestapo.  I can't hardly believe that the people of our country are letting a repeat of Nazi Germany happen:   Right down to believing the fake terrorist attack.    That said,  would  you take a look at about  8 -10 minutes of this interview with Professor Steven Jones ?  It's a 45 minute video and well worth looking at to its end.

These are only examples of the unfettered powers that the new bill would grant to the government; for a complete analysis, please see ACLU's detailed section-by-section summary, available on our website.[3]    2.  Undermining Checks and Balances    Under our Constitution, government powers are subject to control by the courts, the Congress, and ultimately by the American people, informed by a free press.  Checks and balances help ensure both safety and freedom.  They ensure that government actions taken for very important purposes, such as to prevent terrorism or other crime, do not violate the rights of ordinary citizens, and that government is held accountable when they do.  They also help the government, ensuring that its resources are concentrated on arrests of real criminals - not on ineffective, feel-good solutions advanced by political leaders anxious to reassure a frightened public.    This section explains why eroding checks and balances is a false solution to the real problem of terrorism, and then explains just how Patriot Act 2 would further erode three key checks and balances - the courts, Congress, and the free press.    Eroding Checks and Balances Is a False Solution  Anti-terrorism policies that infringe on basic rights - such as ethnically-based roundups of innocent persons, or intrusive surveillance of peaceful political activists - not only make America less free, they make our nation more vulnerable to terrorism.  Such policies waste scarce government resources that should be used to track down real criminals, and help sew the seeds of mistrust among communities that might otherwise be willing to assist the government in arresting terrorists.    As FBI special agent Coleen Rowley observed in a recent letter to Director Robert Mueller, questioning the FBI's priorities in investigating and fighting terrorism:    The vast majority of the one thousand plus persons "detained" in the wake of 9-11 did not turn out to be terrorists. . . . [A]fter 9-11, Headquarters encouraged more and more detentions for what seem to be essentially PR purposes. Field offices were required to report daily the number of detentions in order to supply grist for statements on our progress in fighting terrorism. The balance between individuals' civil liberties and the need for effective investigation is hard to maintain even during so-called normal times, let alone times of increased terrorist threat or war. It is, admittedly, a difficult balancing act. But from what I have observed, particular vigilance may be required to head off undue pressure (including subtle encouragement) to detain or "round up" suspects, particularly those of Arabic origin.[4]    In the same vein, in late 2001, a memorandum was circulated by senior intelligence specialists expressing serious concerns that a focus on racial profiling or other investigative techniques that intrude on civil liberties could undermine security by distracting security officials from less clumsy and more reliable individual suspicion.[5]  At the same time, no fewer than eight high ranking former FBI officials, many from the Reagan and Bush administrations, strongly criticized anti-terrorism proposals that violate civil liberties, saying such tactics were likely to be ineffective and to distract from proven investigative techniques.[6]    While granting new powers to federal agents, the draft bill systematically attacks precisely these basic checks and balances on government power, thus making it harder for professional law enforcement agents to resist pressure by political leaders to implement highly visible policies that violate civil liberties, rather than rely on proven techniques that are effective.|`|AA10026157	Yes, the Patriot Act is ridiculous, and many people now think 9/11 was done by the government so they could establish the Patriot Act.

These Bush loyalists don't know how to pull their heads out of the sand and think for themselves.  We were given the freedoms this Act takes away in order to prevent the government from listening in on the gripes of a disgruntled populace.  Or to prevent them from spying on a revolutionary faction such as the former CSA in the case of a breach of the contract known as the U.S. Constitution on the part of the Federal Government.  This Act is a direct attack on our liberty to speak up for ourselves and defend ourselves from tyranny.  It was designed to strip you of any trace of privacy and leave you standing naked before an all-powerful United Empire of America.  It has done just that, and it's time conservatives saw the light and stopped drinking the Republican Koolade

Precisa de muito mais que isso, e tem de ser tudo feito logo de incio, uma surpresa s,  quando se est com toda a f?r?a popular.     Depois vai ficando impensvel.     1- Aumentaria o salrio mnimo, em 300%, Logo a seguir, fecharia o senado e o congresso para apurar responsabilidades dos seus membros e os manteria  assim, enquanto durasse a apura??o. Promoveria a redu??o salarial geral de funcionrios de alto escal?o ( ajuste a titulo de colabora??o) e da justi?a e aposentados com altos salrios, aumento de sua  carga de trabalho ( dos n?o aposentados, claro), e desviaria estes recursos para gera??o de empregos, sade e educa??o do povo.     2- Convocaria um plebiscito geral para aprovar :    2.1. Reforma agrria, n?o obrigatoriedade  de voto  e de servi?o  militar, integra??o dos civis nas for?as armadas pelo modelo  Sui?o. Ou seja, acabaria com as for?as armadas  parte  da popula??o, e as faria trabalhar metade do tempo na manuten??o e melhoria de escolas,  hospitais, favelas,  estradas, etc..     A outra metade seria de treinamento militar, que seria de tres anos, gerando emprego contnuo  para os que quisessem continuar, indefinidamente, desde que trabalhando, bvio.     2.2. Reforma legislativa,  judiciria e da burocracia reduzindo o nmero drasticamente de leis no pas e  tornando a justi?a eficiente e rpida.      2.3. Reforma poltica e do senado e congresso, com plebiscito para   parlamentarismo e  monarquia aps a apura??o de responsabilidades pelo atual estado do pas, acima.  ( ex-presidentes, ministros, presidentes de estatais, rg?os pblicos, etc..principalmente, includos todos ).     Se aprovado, Restaura??o do trono da famlia Real do Brasil.      2.4. Aprova??o da Lei de Regulamenta??o das grandes fortunas   e revoga??o de todas as emendas constitucionais contra o povo, com a volta definitiva do limite de 12% a.a. das taxas de juros e outras, com aplica??o do arrecadado em gera??o de empregos.    2.5. Reforma do sistema de impostos e financeiro, recolocando os bancos no seu papel de fomentadores de negcios e oportunidades de trabalho, e n?o de lucro financeiro, fazendo-os devolver o lucro que tiraram do povo, ao longo do tempo.       Dedicaria 20% da arrecada??o de impostos de 42% para  o fomento de trabalho ( empregos) e tecnologia, sade  e educa??o, nesta ordem.    Aps algum tempo, diminuiria progressivamenrte a  carga de impostos e a compensaria com   o aumento da produ??o.    2.6. Criaria muitos colgios e centros de esporte e penitencirias   para evitar que os que ainda n?o s?o bandidos se tornem e os que j s?o, mant-los bem trancafiados ( principalmente os de colarinho branco, criminosos e traficantes) em boas e produtivas cadeias, onde possam se recuperar    2.7. Criaria uma CPI sobre a dvida externa e interna, para renegocia??o e apura??o das responsabilidades ao longo dos ultimos anos ( desde sua existncia em maior escala) , n?o para  acabar em pizza, mas para parar de servir nossa pizza pros estrangeiros e empresrios inescrupulosos.     2.8. Criaria uma lei muito dura para casos de corrup??o pblica e propaganda enganosa, crimes de colarinho branco, polticos, manipula??o de m-f dos meios de comunica??o e bens pblicos, etc.. , abuso de poder, crimes hediondos, drogas, jogo,  etc ., corrup??o em geral, principalmente agiotagem.     Algo assim como pris?o por vinte anos, em seguran?a mxima, trabalhando, idem, para tentativas de golpe militar e de altera??o da constitui??o para benefcio proprio ou de minorias poderosas.     2.8. Infelizmente, acho que aps tudo isso, seria quase certo que tambm acabaria morto pelas for?as reacionrias, mas mesmo assim, acho que morreria  feliz.

479871e3d75dcb5abf60e1e4a8629b1faa	Respondendo  quest?o central, acredito que deveria haver uma alternativa (D): "Todas as respostas acima". Porque o fato do povo ter escolhido mal exige, necessariamente, que houvessem polticos mal-intencionados no incio, e o erro de um n?o pode, de forma alguma, eximir o outro. O fato do mandatrio maior da na??o, o presidente, tomar conhecimento de um fato t?o grave quanto o desvio de dinheiro pblico e n?o agir o torna cmplice, e t?o culpado quanto, mesmo que n?o tenha participado diretamente do desvio e que o povo tenha escolhido mal. A resposta mais correta, a que est mais de acordo com a minha opini?o, seria esta, todas as alternativas.    Porm, voc pede que ns escolhamos uma, e vou mudar apenas uma palavra no seu enunciado para responder a quest?o: os MAIS culpados pela morte da crian?a s?o os polticos corruptos. Vou contra a corrente, e contra sua opini?o, por uma raz?o simples: se um cara esquece sua casa aberta, e um ladr?o entra e rouba, voc vai dizer que a maior parte da culpa  do dono? O fato do dono cometer um erro n?o apaga o fato de que, caso n?o existisse primeiro algum disposto a roubar, n?o existiria a necessidade de trancar a casa.    A mesma coisa ocorre no caso da crian?a. O povo  inocente, muito crdulo, escolhe mal, n?o h dvida. Ele tem parte da culpa, sem dvida. O presidente sabia dos desvios e n?o fez nada, ele  culpado tambm. Porm, se n?o houvessem os polticos mal intencionados e dispostos a enganar o povo e a desviar o dinheiro em primeiro lugar, o povo poderia ser crdulo, o presidente poderia ser um homem que n?o age, e ainda assim a crian?a estaria viva. Os maiores culpados, ou os "primeiros" culpados s?o, sem dvida, os polticos corruptos (embora isso n?o tire a culpa dos outros dois).    Por fim, quanto a anular o voto, eu tambm estou inclinado a fazer isso nestas elei??es, o nico problema, o que n?o me faz ter certeza,  saber que, do modo como est a legisla??o eleitoral, n?o h qualquer garantia de que o voto nulo ser interpretado da forma que queremos que seja, e n?o h qualquer garantia de que as elei??es ser?o anuladas caso haja mais de 50% de votos nulos. A legisla??o n?o prev isso, e apesar do STE ter decis?es favorveis a esta interpreta??o, quem garante que ele "aguenta o tranco" quando se tratar de uma elei??o presidencial, com toda a press?o que isso acarreta? Podemos votar nulo com uma inten??o e ver nossos votos ter somente o mesmo efeito dos votos brancos, ou seja, diminuir o nmero de votos necessrios para o mais votado ganhar.|`|c3db87fcc31b8fd0dbc3e288c9fbf22eaa	tambem sempre anulo meu voto|`|50e22e023c7e4d55f0ad2f92b51e8cbaaa	Op??o C.

faaaae350fa538cbe00662ece275b4c2aa	I think that lobbyists serve a vital interest.  Using a lobbyist any group can have their issues and viewpoints heard.  There are lobbists for business and unions, oil companies and conservationists.     If you were a congressman working on tort reform, you need to hear both the insurance side and the trial lawyers agenda.  Should each insurance company and each law firm send employees to Washington to argue their cases?  Some lobbyists are bad apples and play outside the rules.      What we need to stop is the fund raising.  If a politican accepts money from a group, such as teachers unions or auto makers, they should recuse themselves from voting, just like judges.  If it doesn't do any good to try to buy a politican, they will stop trying.|`|AA12337605	The lobby money corrupts our political system, and it should outlawed.

It's basically a bribe.|`|88856d978d2e60bc5a00e15ba247beb9aa	The framers of the Constitution recognized the tendency of people to organize to advance their own interests. They saw the activity of what we today call interest groups as neither sinister nor praiseworthy, just a part of politics in a free society. Their confidence was based on the belief that these interests were so numerous that they would constantly be in competition with one another and that no single group would be dominant.    Even so, the Founding Fathers were not gifted with prophecy, and in today's world of lobbying, the better-organized and the more affluent are more apt to get their case heard by lawmakers, if not always the outcome they seek.    Lobbying's early days     In the early 19th century, when few people were affected by the actions of the federal government, lobbying was a small-scale enterprise. But as the nation grew more populous, more complex and less isolated, the scope of the federal government's activity widened and its policies touched the lives and fortunes of more people. Then as now, when the actions of the federal government have an impact on citizens, they seek to make that impact work to their advantage.    The period of the Civil War saw a huge upsurge in interest group activity. The need to supply a huge army meant that lucrative government contracts were up for grabs. Financiers vied for the right to sell federal government bonds, and entreaties from people seeking government jobs and contracts to supply the army formed a constant parade to the White House. Nonetheless, the humble petitioners seeking government clerkships were overshadowed by aggressive corporations seeking the enormous profits to be made from the war.     The hope of some that the federal government would retreat to its pre-war compactness proved unrealistic. The entrepreneurs made rich by the war did not relinquish their profitable ties to government.     Added to that were new potential beneficiaries of federal programs: the soldiers who had served in the Union Army. In 1866, the nation's first mass-membership interest group was formed, the Grand Army of the Republic. What the former soldiers lacked in money they made up in numbers. GAR, at its peak, boasted a membership of more than 400,000 and was instrumental in lobbying Congress to enact a pension bill, in 1890. President Grover Cleveland, who had vetoed the bill, was defeated for re-election in 1888 in large measure because of the veto.     Economic changes after the Civil War led to demands for government to adopt policies that promoted industrial development. The railroads received huge grants of federal land to build transcontinental rail networks. The postwar growth of commerce resulted in an increase of mail and the hiring of thousands of postal workers, who organized the National Association of Letter Carriers to lobby Congress to improve their work conditions.    The half-century after the Civil War was also a period of congressional ascendancy. A succession of weak presidents and strong congressional leaders made Capitol Hill the logical place to go to seek the favors of government. It also initiated an upsurge in the number of former members of Congress who became lobbyists selling their legislative knowledge, and their close contacts.    Corruption on a scale never imagined by Americans was one byproduct of the frenzied activity of corporate lobbyists. It produced the scandal of Crdit Mobilier of America, in 1872. Officials of the company, which had been created to skim a profit from railroad construction, gave large blocks of stock to Vice President Schuyler Colfax and a number of GOP congressmen to forestall a congressional inquiry.     Ironically, reform efforts have produced heightened lobbying. When farmers from the Plains states urged Congress to protect them from price gouging by the railroad industry that hauled their produce to market, Congress created the Interstate Commerce Commission to regulate rates, which merely led rail officials to target their lobbying at the ICC.     A growth industry     Sometimes, technological innovation has spurred lobbying. The advent of radio and TV provided an avenue for special-interest advertising capable of reaching large audiences. So too has the emergence of the automobile, pharmaceutical and energy industries, which led to government regulations. These, in turn, led these industries to form trade associations and hire lobbyists to influence these regulations.    The flaw in the Founding Fathers' benign view of interest groups is that while no single interest group dominates all areas of policies, the wealthiest groups and the lobbyists with the best inside connections or representing organizations with mass memberships do monopolize individual areas of national policy.     This does not, by itself, promote illegal activity of the sort ascribed to Abramoff. Certainly, there are not many like him among Washington lobbyists. But it is the Abramoffs who are more likely to get the ear of lawmakers than are ordinary citizens who lack the means to buy tickets to their fundraisers.|`|AA11120000	It already is. take away the fancy name and call it what it is.................

Even Clinton aged much more than 8 years while he was in office and he didn't have much to worry about seeing how the evil empire was through and the War on Terrorism was yet to start.    There also aren't any "right" answers.  That is to say there are no answers/choices in which there are no consequences or drawbacks.  Perfect solutions don't exist.  Only trade offs.    The Social Security crisis for example.  The liberals want to keep it like it is but the problem is that it won't work the same way it has because of the baby boomers and the BABY-BUST.  The Baby boomers did not have LOTS AND LOTS of babies like their parents did after WWII.      If they had, there would be no problem. But we are going to have a serious strain on the system when the boomers are retired.  And what folks don't understand is the work force of tomorrow is not going to support the kind of payroll taxes that will be necessary to keep the level of services we have now.  Tomorrow's workers will vote for candidates that will cut benefits and lower their taxes.

2ae7c04d86d73c7def18f4f44fcecff6aa	La domanda che devi farti :  Quale governo ha raccontato pi palle e ha fatto pi danni tra quello di Berlusconi e quello di prodi?  Berlusconi di errori ne ha fatti in 5 anni. Ma il precedente governo viene superato alla grande da quello di prodi che in tre mesi ha fatto uscire delinquenti,ha introdotto delle liberalizzazioni inutili,ha bloccato 2/3 delle opere pubbliche e ha permesso agli immigrati di divenire italiani in soli 5 anni. Complimenti!  Il governo prodi ha fatto girare l'Italia? Certo,infatti ha fatto fare al paese un'inversione a U e lo sta mandando allo sfacelo!
