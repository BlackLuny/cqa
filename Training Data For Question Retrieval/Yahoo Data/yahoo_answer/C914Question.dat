I'm asking a question concerning my mother. 3 years ago someone charged too much on her debit card that left her checking account in a -$76 balance. After "settling" this with her bank, 3 years later Capital Management Services, LP send her a letter (today) demanding $461.65 but are willing to settle for $323.16. She's in the state of Illinois if this helps.      The letter states:      If you notify this office in writing within 30 days of receiving this notice that you dispute the validity of this debt or any portion thereof, this office will obtain verification of the debt or obtain a copy of a judgment...      SO my question is will they actually come after her bank account and freeze her funds over this? Is that even possible or are they trying to scare her into paying? She is so stubborn that she refuses to pay it since she did not make those charges and her old bank supposedly disputed the charges and agreed in her favor.

20090307224154AA99qFh	Business & Finance;Corporations	Stimulate this - First of all let me tell you I'm not as smart as the CEO's that make millions and then almost?	bankrupt their company. I'm just one of the countless people who have been let go after many years of service. So I'm sure their are some flaws to my idea, but it could be at least a good start.       The government pays the salaries of people laid off in the last 6 months to a year, if they are hired back. So instead of paying people unemployment for doing nothing, the government would be paying people to work. It could be a combination of state and federal money. Since the state is already paying about half (in unemployment), the federal government would only have to "match" what the state is paying. If we do this, workers would have jobs and employers would have "free" labor. The government could pay this benefit for a year. After that, if the company retained the employees, they would receive a tax break of some kind. I'm sure some companies would try and cheat the government, but don't a lot of the unemployed do this anyway.   It seems like a win/win/win situation. Workers would have jobs. They'd have money(more than they would if just on unemployment). Be able to spend more money and pay more taxes. Companies would their post lay off payroll, but their pre lay off employee size, without paying any extra. They would be able to produce more products. And with more people having jobs, the companies would be able to increase sales. With more people working and companes increasing sales, the government would be getting more money in taxes. Win/win/win.

Calculate the value of monthly payments (a) if interest is compounded once a year, and (b) if interest is compounded monthly.

20070329223503AA3nh6B	Business & Finance;Personal Finance	What is my best recourse if someone stole and cashed a 3rd party check made out to me?	In USA. Check for several hundred dollars. I have a copy of the returned check from the person that wrote it to me.      It was deposited by ATM into a bank, not endorsed but with "for deposit only" and an account number written on it by whoever stole it. I have the name of the bank it was deposited to, as printed by the ATM.      What do I do next? Try to work through the bank that cashed it? If I didn't endorse the check and my name isn't on the account it was deposited to, they should never have cashed/funded it, right? Are they liable for this? In my initial contact with the bank (due to privacy concerns) they would not tell me whose account it was deposited into.      Or do I call the police? Seems unlikely that they'd do much for something like this. Any thoughts about next steps would be appreciated.

20090227122117AA1g8lX	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Am I obligated to pay this appraisal fee?	I contacted a mortgage broker I have used before about doing a cash out re-finance on my home combining the 1st and 2nd mortgage and getting some cash.  He gave me all the details and sent over a good faith estimate and I provided all of the information in order to proceed.  I later find out I cannot do a re-finance because our house is currently for sale.  Therefore, I opt to go with a HELOC to refinance the existing 2nd mortgage.  He quoted me a rate of prime and said it appears we are below 80% LTV and should have some additional equity to borrow against if we would like.  The appraisal came back at $359K...far lower than the $398K appraisal I have done a few month earlier (that he would not accept) in order to remove my PMI.  Coincidentally, the $359K put us right at 80% LTV and he proceeded to tell me the rate is no longer prime...it is now a 5% floor rate.  I told him I was not interested...since I knew I could get a better deal (and I did with another bank).  When I told him I was not interested and stated the appraisal seems way off...he said I still owe for the appraisal.  Am I still obligated to pay this?  Given my situation it seems like they purposely tried to get my appraisal to come in where I would not be under 80% LTV.  From the recent sales in my area I know the $359K is low.  Regardless, I was not happy with the entire process and was not informed of anything until after the appraisal.  If he would have told me that it did not look like we would be under 80% LTV then he should have said so...instead of SURPRISE...you are not getting prime...the best we can do is a 5% floor.  Another thing I should mention, I did not sign a Good Faith Estimate for the HELOC application...since I was originally applying for conventional loan.  I only signed a Good Faith for the conventional loan.

My boyfriend and I purchased a new house a few months ago and now we just broke up. The deed and mortgage is in both of our names and he has now moved out. He hates confrontation so he will not discuss the situation with me only that he sees it as 1. I get the house, 2.He gets the house 3.we rent it out or 4. we lose it to the bank. I have worked so hard to get where I am and he cheated on me and walked out so I would hate to give up my house (my daughter lives there with me as well). I did not put myself in this situation and my whole world is just up in the air right now. I do not want to give him the house but I cannot afford it on my own. The market is horrible and this is a new townhome so there is no equity and I am pretty sure the house would not sell as there are many available the builder is still even trying to get rid of and offering many incentives. Is it possible to still hold him responsible for half the mortgage or do I have to sell if I cannot refinance on my own?

20090227123122AAKzm95	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	Why is my dad trying to file my taxes with my mom's?	I only worked for 3 months last year and made $2000 total. He says that he wants to file it with my mom (she makes minimum wage also) since I didn't make that much and we'll both get a "bigger refund". Is it true? I keep thinking that he's lying because my dad is nosy. He wants to know a lot of things and I keep thinking that he wants to file my mom and my taxes together so he can see my W2 just to see how much I made at work last summer.      Is it possible to combine taxes between the parent and child? And WILL you get more if you do? Is he lying? Should I just file by myself?

20070418093725AAzolkP	Business & Finance;Credit	Legalized loan sharking, legalized robbery, Is that what this is?	Ok I have had a credit card from a well established bank for years and never used it. They sent it to me with great terms, 7.9% fixed for the life of the card. And thats "they sent it to me, I did not go out of my way to get it. Well I had a balance of over 7k on a loan at 11.25% so I used the credit card to pay it off. Now they send a letter that the interest is increasing to 21.45% and variable. This is no fly by night bank either. Its actually a bunch of BS. What recourse do I have? They have the standard clause in the agreement "We can raise rates for any reason". I guess I have too much faith that if I honor the terms and pay as agreed they will honor them also. And by the way my credit reports are good, Scores all over 720, no late payments of defaults. Nothing on them has changed since they issued the card except overall debt went down so I am not buying their excuse of information obtained from a consumer report

20070528140556AAZ4ILk	Business & Finance;Corporations	Has anybody heard of Cargo Express Company?	They sent me a email through careerbuilder about a merchandising manager position.  Here is an excerpt of the email.-DESCRIPTION-Over the past four years, Cargo Express Company  has emerged as the leading innovator in the merchandise forwarding service with an approach focused on European.       The US take-up of Internet trading is much higher than in the    Europe. Many Internet auctions and stores in the United States of America do not ship the    products overseas.    As the result thousands of customers in Europe are not able to access the large market and purchase high-quality merchandise at so low prices. Cargo Express    provides European customers with US and Canada street addresses that can be used as the shipping addresses. Then our merchandise managers forward the packages to the country where the customer is located. It is the same if they had relatives or friends in the United States and could ask    them about such service.
20070723202640AAgNeGV	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	HOA swimming pool demo?	well about a year ago my parents drained out the pool because they were going to clean it then repaint and fill up the pool.  It was left without water for  a few weeks and one side of the pool came out of the ground.  it rained and HOA sent us a few notices about stagnant water, we drained it but it has been raining alot in houston.  We now got cited and are supposed to appear in court in a couple of weeks.  My dad and brothers demolished the pool then covered it with fill dirt and there is no more stagnant water.  A friend of mine said that we should have got a permit to demo the pool.      My question is can we demolish it ourselves then fill it up?  Did we need any permits?      Should we present photos of finished work at court or just wait and see what they tell us?      Thanks any help would be appreciated

20090227124008AAwQJTE	Business & Finance;Insurance	Health Insurance question- Do you really have to pay the difference?	My dad had a kidney stone surgery recently done and his insurance paid 80%. On the insurance claim it says that he is responsible for the difference. However, my dad heard on the radio before that you don't need to pay for these types of things. I was kinda reluctant to believe him because it says so on the bill. But he went to the doctor that did the procedure and the doctor even said that he shouldn't be billed. (The doctor is not the one billing us, its the lithotriptor company) The doctor says that when the company receives the job, they should know first hand that the insurance wont pay full and basically the company is trying to make us pay an unnecessary bill.       My dad had already had this procedure done before, many years ago. It was a different insurance company back then and also a different doctor, however the lithotriptor place is the same. Back then, we also received a bill for the difference. But when my dad showed the letter to that doctor, he handled it somehow and we did not have to pay.      I just called the company's billing center and the lady said we have to pay because thats what the benefits say, the patient is responsible for the difference. But I mentioned the first time we got the procedure done and I said we didnt have to pay that time. She said she saw that on records but it says that we paid but we didnt. I dunno what the old doctor did that time but is there any ways around this?

Although I make a decent salary that is much higher then my husbands.  I keep getting conflicting advice on how to rebuild my credit, any ideas?
