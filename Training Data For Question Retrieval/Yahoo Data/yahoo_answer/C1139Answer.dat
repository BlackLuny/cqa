f47faeb8ee17f9d7f4a272f33c251bebaa	Here are rules I try to follow:<br>  Less is more (simple outfit + accesories= perfect outfit that looks good but still comfy)<br>  Wear what you feel confident in and rock it to the highest potientiential (i know sounds cheesy) but nothing is more attractive then confidence that's the hottest spice out there<br>  finally wear what you want not what the red carpet offers when you think about it not EVERY celeb has the most amazing outfits|`|KQq4BqkFaa	There are a ton of websites out there that I have used to spice up my wardrobe, but really simple things like wearing layered shirts, or something in the back of your closet or dresser and wear it with maybe a new shirt. Buying a new shirt or two and pair of jeans then wering it with one of your older peices always makes the outfit look new a refreshed. make-up wise, for simple makes it the best. It's fun to play around with make-up and see what works best. I sometimes use blush for eyeshadow. Just experiemnt. It's fun.|`|AA10957847	usually when Im so tired of my wardrobe, I just take a few of my old and untouched clothes and renew them. you know like cutting my long skirt into a mini-skirt. or coloring my white blouse into pink. or cutting parts of my t-shirt to make it into a tank top or something like that.<br>  AS for make up, im not that much of an expert(i prefer to play with my clothes and body, rather than to play with my face), but some thing I like to do if i want to look good without too much efforts are things like using my lip balm or lip gloss as an eyeshadow(natural), and put lipglos after my lipstick(again so it looks natural).
KQq4BqkFaa	Yes. She was actually a very pretty actress in her time. I'd take it as a complement|`|751151eb93619ded4377476379c6dd5eaa	Yes, she was very hot. She was on a TV prog called One Day at a Time in the 70s. She married Eddie Van Halen at the peak of his career, then fell out of sight and most likely on to a couch with a box of cookies. He dropped her eventually, him still being a alchy rock star, and her being a cow. She's recently become a poster child for losing weight (new spokesperson for Jenny Craig), which she has a lot to lose. Just hope you don't turn into a blimp like her. Take a lesson.|`|8xHRpxihaa	Valerie still is considered beautiful by many.<br>  I would half to say Yes.|`|dxXgRAVgaa	Could be meant as a compliment, but it could also just be said as like, a fact, you know what I mean?|`|1Ayb4UK7aa	Yes, she is still pretty.|`|6qGHT77Raa	yes..she was cute when she was younger.|`|23e57bd1ca8f35a8604d6b4cd0dee4c7aa	YES!!!!!

Just the simple cheap stuff will work <br>  <br>  You can shower with the glue in ones, but not the clip on's <br>  <br>  If you get the glue on kind, they last like 3-4 months, but it hurts SO bad to take them out.  I wouldnt recomend getting them weaved in either, its expensive and leaves you with alot of tangles. Clip on's are best :)<br>  <br>  You don't need the $500 jessica simpson hair extensions for them to look real, i get mine at sallys beauty supply and they work fine. And there cheap!
E2GgsxVRaa	I would wait, tattoo's can hurt your immune system.  If you are having surgery, you want your immune system at it's highest!  Also, if you have surgery you might not be able to clean and take care of your tattoo as you should which raises the risk of infection.|`|DF5mmF41aa	It isn't a problem per se, but it is just another thing for your immune system to worry about.<br>  <br>  I would just wait until after surgery, and give your body time to recover before you give it something else to heal.|`|63add21dd7d2f325cfa7bfc8e4ea4958aa	I would hold off.  Your body also needs  to concentrate on healing itself after your surgery.  A tattoo is actually very traumatic to the skin ...more than many people would think - even though it is taken pretty lightly often times.  I would get the tattoo after your surgery is done and healed up...|`|Is47cwSWaa	I'm guessing after back surgury you can't move much...so how would you be able to take care of your back and still monitor your tattoo?  Seems like not the best idea.....|`|My9fl8edaa	not unless you have to give a blood sample.|`|ssQHMKh6aa	no only b/c the ink could cause some false info.  for the Drs. and u dont want that|`|OQ3eow7Jaa	Idk  my guss is NO!!!|`|plXLCZXraa	It shouldnt be a problem, but i wouldnt suggest getting it on your back because that may hurt. Good luck with the surgery!!
KW8SiEqnaa	Stretch marks are completely normal.  Even the skinny, "perfect" models you see everywhere have stretch marks - they're just airbrushed away by people whose job it is to give America the idea that they aren't perfect.  Only about 5% of women don't have them.  If you're looking to get rid of them, I recommend using a product with a high amount of cocoa butter.  Good luck!|`|6d8Zy9ZEaa	They suck. I think almost everyone has them somewhere, if not theyre truly lucky. Lol... i have been going on a hunt lately to get rid of them. The best thing i have tried that isnt expensive, is to use cocoa butter lotion or any lotion and MASSAGE. Trust me it works because the stretch marks in the depth of your skin will straighten up and eventually fade away on the surface of your skin. Its working for me.|`|tTnX75Eiaa	they r nasty.  massage coco butter for stretch marks everyday for at least 20-30 minutes.  they will fade with time|`|JxpCyt8Vaa	Eh, I don't really focus on that area.<br>  I mostly focus people's faces. <br>  Stretch marks may fade if the person uses cocoa butter daily, if it bothers them.
4769b530e02572d6a0c84645a6d398cfaa	Drink lots and lots of water. Water is a natural body cleanser and cleans from the inside out. Wash your face twice a day. I use Neutrogena because it works fast and is dermatologist reccommended. (I use the Oil-Free acne wash: <a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/ProductsDetails_18.asp?lProductLineID=13)." rel="nofollow">http://www.neutrogena.com/ProductsDetail...</a><br>  <br>  1. Wet your face with warm water (even though you're breaking out on one side it's better to clean the entire face to prevent breakouts everywhere else)<br>  2. Dab the facial on your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin and rub all over your face in little circles for about 2 mins.<br>  3. Rinse with cold water.<br>  4. Grab a clean towel and lightly pat your face dry. Then apply the Neutrogena Rapid Clear moisturizer (<a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/ProductsDetails_258.asp?lProductLineID=13)." rel="nofollow">http://www.neutrogena.com/ProductsDetail...</a> Rub it all over your face, especially the effected area.<br>  5. Drink a bottle of water before you go to bed to help brighten and clear skin during the night.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps. Here are some tips to keep away breakouts:<br>  - Avoid eating salty foods (like chips) before bed. This makes acne worse<br>  - Try not to eat 1 hour - 30mins before bed. When you eat directly before bed your body spends the night breaking the food down while you're sleeping and stores the fats and oils from the food in your pores and body (causing pimples when you wake up)<br>  - Wear SPF lotion/moisturizer. Try to block the sun's rays from your skin to avoid dryness which causes redness and itching sometimes, which can make skin peel and look like acne<br>  <br>  That's everything I can think of! Hopefully this helps. It worked for me.|`|46OeMCbXaa	Hi. I had moderate acne and literally spent thousands of dollars on products that either didn't work or burned my skin off. I stumbled upon acne.org and discovered aloe vera gel had an extremely high performance rating. I tried it and my acne has since cleared. <br>  <br>  I use a neutrogena oil free cleanser in the morning and at night I use the same cleanser, followed by a heavy application of aloe vera gel. I hope this helps.|`|68c483568d32e2824d0063eea1c62919aa	water helps out alot with your skin it makes it healthy and clean if you wanted to try some type of acne control product might i suggest proactiv it works really well its a little more expensive then the otc stuff like neutrogena and so forth but it works well

DNYGZkaraa	Three words.<br>  <br>  Exfoliate. Wax. Moisturize.<br>  <br>  A great way to exfoliate your skin and prevent those ingrown hairs is to use a mixture of sugar and olive oil.<br>  <br>  Massage it into your legs while standing in the tub. Then shower or bathe to rinse it all off.<br>  <br>  Waxing is the easiest way to start reducing the hair on your legs.<br>  <br>  I've tried everything on the market, and find the Parisa brand pre-waxed strips to be the best. Easy to use. Not messy. <br>  <br>  After waxing, be sure to moisturize your skin.<br>  <br>  Pamper your body and love it to death and it will treat you well for years to come.|`|2lrN2Ec8aa	Ingrown hairs (which also result in bumps) are usually a result of improper exfoliation after waxing or shaving.  Get a good scrub and make sure to exfoliate your touher skin often with a good netted white body sponge and some exfoliating scrub.<br>  <br>  Getting a good razor helps - and make sure to change your razor often if using a standard razor because they can get dull, which also causes rash.  <br>  <br>  Shaving properly also helps not to stress the skin too much - use even strokes, not scraping too hard, and don't go over the skin in the same exact area too many times.<br>  <br>  Get a good lipid repair oil to smooth on your newly shaved areas - this should also help keep skin supple and help avoid razor burn and rash.|`|5506e34857b2b8f48948d9ed1019e6f3aa	visine helps razor rash  ......... trust me !!!!!! it gets rid of the bumps and it might also help pimples too !!!! ..... you might also want to try a got razor like intuition or a good razor that isnt dull because a dull really cheap razor is known to cause bad razor bumps on me ...... also try to soak yor legs in warm water before you shave too ..... that also might even help ........ but make sure you have a really good razor to stay away from razor bumps and change your blade when needed !!!!|`|75aL8fS9aa	Try a hair removal creme. Test it on your skin first, but usually it reduces the appearance of hair and lasts pretty long. Veet and Nair are two brands that are easy to find *personally i find Nair to smell better and leave my skin smoother, and i have really sensitive skin*|`|AA10784019	If you wear slacks all the time this happens.<br>  Start bathing in sea salt and watch them go away.  True story.  Use a good body oil after you get out of the tub, I like neutragena body oil.

A0W1ezmbaa	no its not avon is not geared for specific skin conditions and there representitives don't really know much about skin, i would go with a professional line i personally suffered from acne and love dermalogica line. its geared for YOUR skin condition and type you may not need the same moisturizer as some one else who has acne or maybe you have more sensitive skin so you need a differnt exfoliater. go to some one who is experienced in treating skin not just some one who wants to sell sell sell. dermalogica is a really great line and i have tried them all :) it is found in both spa's and at the dermatologist office you can go to www.dermalogica.com to find the closest place to you that offers it. good luck:)|`|dbb2871a8394af7a08c8cc5460db987aaa	If you want to use a good acne product, please look into natural remedy listed on this website.

Make sure you always condition after washing your hair.  Also, deep condition with a moisturizing treatment at least once a month (a lot of people do it every week).  A leave-in conditioner or any gloss cream by Paul Mitchell will probably be your life saver.  You've probably heard that washing your hair often is bad for you.  The reason why shampoos are harsh on your hair is because they contain Sodium Laureth Sulfate. Sodium LS provides a foaming quality to shampoos, but it's really bad for you.  Get a new moisturizing shampoo that does not contain this ingredient.<br>  Make sure you are not using any hair products with mineral oil or petrolatum either :D Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Side note, make sure to also not use any facial cleansers with Sodium Laureth Sulfate.  <a href="http://www.natural-health-information-centre.com/sodium-laureth-sulfate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.natural-health-information-ce...</a>

To my surprise my hair felt allot lighter and silkier due the the lack of wax, and my hair is down to my waste and is extremely thick.  It is just expensive. If You are worried about straightening and blow drying your hair, then sleep with large curlers in your hair to flatten any frizzies and give your hair bounce.|`|ve4h5Ff0aa	It can.... use ThermaSilk.

Put a styling product in you hair.<br>  2. Put the diffuser on your blow dryer.<br>  3. Do not use your hands. Let the diffuser do the work for you.

O5YwOMvpaa	If you want to get a tan without using that fake tanner that makes everyone look orange, follow these simple steps<br>  Tan in your own backyard. It's cheaper and possibly healthier than tanning booths. All you need is your tanning lotion and a beach chair. Position the chair in the yard where the sun will hit you directly. <br>  Consider using self tanner which is safer and gives you a real looking tan. Make sure to find one that does not make you look orange. <br>  <br>  Always, always wear sunscreen when you tan! if you are just going to sit on the beach and tan for an hour put spf 8 on. If you don't use sunscreen while tanning, UVA and UVB rays will still harm your skin, even if you don't get burned! *If it's your first time going to a tanning booth, don't go for very long; talk to the cashier about the recommended length. <br>  If you stay out in the sun too long, you could be in danger of heatstroke. <br>  Tanning can cause skin cancer, so be careful to regulate how often you tan! Tanning every day isn't good for you! Also, keep track of any moles, and watch for changes in colour or shape. <br>  Start with a short time in the sun, say 15 minutes / day for a sensitive skin. If you see no problems you can gradually increase your time in the sun. In case of red spots or itching take a few days break from tanning. <br>  Be careful also when exposing new areas of skin to direct sunlight<br>  <br>  Sunburns can be anywhere from 1st degree burns to 3rd degree burns. If you get burned very badly, see a doctor immediately! <br>  Extensive tanning/exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation could cause you to get skin cancer, which in it's worst form is called Melanoma. (Using a spray tan IS more safe. If you must be colored and don't care if you turn slightly orange, you could save your life.) <br>  Using sunbeds, as with all forms of Ultraviolet exposure, can be dangerous. If you can not tan easily because you are naturally pale, do not go to extremes to tan. <br>  As people become more aware of the health risks associated with tanning, they may begin to realize that fair skin is just as attractive as dark skin. Be yourself, and people will accept you as who you are, not because of your complexion.|`|305f986cb88af463a2004247d0fe42c3aa	buy the dove tan cream, very little tan to start with and easy to use.|`|JZQLvGVLaa	Defintely a solarium or tan-spray can thing...um with the solarium i woudntuse it more than three times per year, its very dangerous in the long term.<br>  <br>  Spray cans are usuallyeffectie and spread evenly, i find the moisturizers like Holiday or Dove that have tan within it and build up over time are best if you aply correctlyto avoid streaking. (Apply in a circular motion)<br>  <br>  :-)<br>  <br>  gud luck!|`|wZd7kaX8aa	For all information and details about tanning please check out <a href="http://use-tanning.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://use-tanning.blogspot.com/</a>

A darker color can be used in the fold of the eye. <br>  <br>  Step5 Consider wearing false eyelashes to give your eyes a more wide-eyed, innocent look. Be sure to use natural-looking eyelashes. <br>  <br>  Step6  Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler before applying mascara to give you the same effect as false eyelashes. <br>  <br>  Step7  Try a black mascara if brown does not bring out your eyes enough. <br>  |`|Uz0lfVKRaa	DON'T use eyeliner, it will make your eyes appear smaller, instead use dark eyeshadow close to your lashline, applied with a small brush, and add two layers of darkest mascara, also put some shadow on the botton lashline, and I know you will look GREAT.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|OLWGk6eaaa	you need eye liner (black or brown), eyelash curler and mascara, don't forget the eye shadow, I usually check magazines or online to see how famous artist apply the eye shadow.|`|a8tfYUXyaa	well do not wear eye liner it will make your eyes look smaller use a LIGHT black mascara and a lightly towned brown or your favorite color but keep it light
v9OJus2gaa	Allora, seguimi attentamente....<br>  <br>  Credo che tu ti riferisca a questo tipo di make up...è bello se per una serata si vuole cambiare stupendo un pò tutti....però per il quotidiano è sconsigliatissimo....non è semplice...<br>  <br>  Qui ti descriverò passo passo questo maquillage... :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://eur.i1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/xp/premiere_photo/20050906/07/3550342851.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://eur.i1.yimg.com/eur.yimg.com/xp/p...</a><br>  <br>  Innanzitutto il viso deve essere curato con una buona crema idratante che nutra la pelle e la prepari alle applicazioni successive e poi l'incarnato deve essere chiaro, con effetto a "bambola di porcellana"...dunque procedi così :<br>  <br>  Puoi stendere un antiocchiaie o un correttore per coprire eventuali fastidiose occhiaie; scegli un colore di un tono o due toni più chiari della tua pelle...<br>  <br>  Poi passa al fondotinta, in tono con la propria carnagione (cmq di solito il beige naturale sta bene a tutte), che va steso con una spugnetta dall'interno del viso verso l'esterno (c'è anche chi usa le dita); deve essere coprente ma non troppo per <<eliminare>> i difetti (foruncoletti o altre imperfezioni) , ma soprattutto meglio sceglierlo in una nuance trasparente...<br>  <br>  La cipria, che deve essere rigorosamente trasparente...mettila sopra il fondotinta, così opacizzi e fissi il trucco...<br>  <br>  Ombretto : scegli un colore beige madreperlato come base da stendere su tutta la palpebra...mentre sulla palpebra mobile andrai ad applicare un ombretto porpora con movimenti circolari che non appesantiscono l'occhio...cura in particolare l'angolo esterno...sfuma infine un pò col dito...<br>  <br>  Ora puoi tracciare una linea sottile di eyeliner (meglio quello in gel col pennellino apposito che permette di dosare le quantità giuste evitando così di eccedere) partendo dall'angolo esterno dell'occhio...<br>  <br>  Disegna la linea interna degli occhi con una matita nera morbida e la stessa matita passala immediatamente sotto l'occhio, a livello delle ciglia inferiori...<br>  <br>  Il mascara è il must del make up : non deve mai mancare!!! Applicalo dalle radici fino alle punte con movimenti a zig zag che penetrano nelle ciglia, così <<apri>> lo sguardo....<br>  <br>  Con un mascara consumato invece, pettina le ciglia inferiori e struttura le sopracciglia...altrimenti queste ultime puoi scegliere di disegnarle con un pennellino e farle biondo scuro così come s'è l'è fatte disegnare lei....(dipende se sei bionda o bruna)<br>  <br>  Spolvera un fard rosato su tutta la superficie degli zigomi con sfumature leggere ma estese....<br>  <br>  Sulle labbra prima del rossetto, metti un burro cacao o un balsamo per ammorbidire e per tenere più a lungo il rossetto...applica poi con un pennello un rossetto rosso fuoco o rosso sangue , disegnando bene il centro delle labbra...poi fissa con un tratto di matita in tinta...<br>  <br>  Avrai un incarnato cristallino, zigomi alti e labbra corpose...<br>  <br>  Per il resto, capelli boccolati biondo platino, smalto rigorosamente in tono col rossetto e abitini stretti in vita e che diano valore al seno e ai fianchi...una vera pin up insomma! <br>  <br>  Spero di averti aiutata baci ;-)|`|AQsaeTfbaa	credo che la cosa migliore che tu possa fare è cercare foto di cantanti o attrici anni 50 e copiare da li<br>  buona fortuna|`|ilyawfBpaa	capelli cotonati trucco deciso sugli occhi con una matita nera e vestiti che ricordino quegli anni|`|ovekXlQxaa	ciucciamela

UQnHb6zGaa	 The great thing about style is that you can make it uniquely your own. You do not have to look like everyone else. <br>  What I do is pull looks from different places. Something I see in a catalog or a girl on the street. But a put my own touches to the look.<br>  <br>  It is so easy to get to that place where you just throw on the same old comfortable stuff everyday. There is nothing wrong with comfortable. Just not sloppy.<br>  Since you have a small budget I would try to look for tops that you can wear with your jeans.Tops with a little stretch in them. <br>  One way to update a look is to add accessories. This includes shoes, Jewelry, belts and long scarves. Just do not overload them. 3 to 8 pieces is enough.<br>  Try shopping on-line at Target or Ross you can find cute stuff that is affordable or even down right cheap. Always look for clearance pages.<br>  <br>  After you have done your shopping. First throw away your old stuff, So you do not revert back. Second pull your outfits together in advance.<br>  Know what tops your want to wear w/which bottoms, plus accessories. <br>  |`|3bcC24obaa	Check out Old Navy. The offer some cute styles that aren't complicated and are affordable. I myself hit the sale racks in stores first to stretch my dollar but, I never buy clothes I hate. Buy clothes that mix and match well together and it's like doubling your wardrobe. Simple brown and black dress shoes match most everything. Take some time when you have it and hit the stores. Also try putting your outfit together before you go to bed. You can make sure you match, your mind is clearer and it saves time.|`|pzX3hmgyaa	start chopping up your shirts and jeans, to make that "worn in" look.  my ex did it all the time.  even with new shirts she would cut the collar out and wear it off one shoulder cut slits in the back and stuff, like 80's style i guess.  she would drag her old jeans across the pavement to make them look like Holister "torn" jeans.  all that is free and it looks racey.  streak your hair. all kinds of stuff for relatively cheap.<br>  |`|7kYlDrrbaa	Change you hairstyle; buy some new, funky, stylish clothes.<br>  <br>  But still be you!<br>  <br>  PS. answer my question.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An6ZehAKkPTQmyIj3v9FioYjzKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20081016164617AAtIEtJ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|rIZ5mRucaa	I would say go to forever21 to shop. You can put simple things together that look really good. forever21 is cheap and classy. =D |`|EsgKr5z8aa	Try a more funky look. Get clothes from vintage stores, goodwill, or really cheap places like Chinatown ( I live in L.A.). <br>  Some plastic jewelery, a funky scarf and some cheap but cute shoes. |`|kAvfQ44haa	its easy get naked :)|`|6d98a64816296fe77215f4e289847060aa	Okay honey, <br>  First off, You're Beautiful, clothes don't make you. What they do is make  YOU look even more beautiful. My advice to you is H&M. Very fashionable and wouldn't hurt your pockets.You can get 5 or more outfits with $200 and still be iin fashion, Trust me. Its hard thinking about wasting money, but it's wise to stay in style and still have money. <br>  GO to H&M. They have everything you would need. Please dont pick up any sweats or tee shirts. <br>  Get a pair of skinny jeans,grandpa cardigan(fall color(purple, brown, grey,mustard or black), anywear jean( a jean that can be worn to work or to a social gathering, usually a dark rinse jean), a wool jacket or coat, and shirts that shows off your figure(not too tight, but form fitting). Have fun!!|`|ixcx1WkEaa	Spend some time getting acquainted with your personal style.  Are you a more casual or formal person?  Do you like a cleaner style, or something with more accessories?  Even if you can't buy actual clothes just yet, try getting some fashion magazines or clothing catalogs and see if you can find anything that reminds you of your own style.  In the meantime, try altering the clothes you already have.  An afternoon with some scissors and thread can yield great results--just experiment!  Try looking online for some tutorials on how to alter your old clothing into 'new' styles.  I think you'll be surprised what you can come up with!|`|U8VGvgC1aa	Wanna know my trick? I don't have a lot of time or money for a whole new wardrobe either. I have a little one who comes first. But every time I'm out-whether it be at Target, or the mall or whatever. I pick out one thing for myself. Slowly you build a whole new wardrobe! But as for what you should buy, get what you like. Stay away from sweatshirts, there is no need for 3 at the most!! Then you won't have them to fall back on! Lastly, pick out your outfit the night before. Accessories and everything! You will feel a lot better about yourself when you know you look put together! |`|B4Bu4s0Qaa	well just try going shopping at like belks, JCpennys, rue 21, and target..just get some cute tops and skinny jeans to go with them.<br>  try hitting all the clearance that's what i do, i always try to look cute for as cheap as i can...its easy and fun!<br>  good luck|`|dXQurEZGaa	Sounds like you are in a rut.  We all have them!!  I suggest getting a few friends together and have a swap party!  Bring anything you don't want, and be prepared to trade clothes, makeup, shoes, whatever.  Jewelery might even be an option.  In this party, have the girls do makeovers for each other and just experiment.  You will get lots of ideas, and have a ton of fun!  Good luck!!|`|aPyQ6im8aa	try getting a few key new pieces like some bright undershirts, jewlry and hair things. go to thrift shops and look for interesting things. get a new haircut thats low matinence so it doesnt take forever to style. dont wear sweatshirts often. layer tanks and long sleeves and lots of necklaces. get a few pairs of good jeans and wear lots of mix and match.|`|0tYG30NXaa	Plastic Surgery and Expensive Shopping|`|mm7u00AJaa	Jeans are a good start, and you've already got those. You should focus on getting some cute new shirts and accessories. Some good places for reasonably cheap (but cute) stuff: Target, Old Navy, and Goodwill/other thrift stores. Also, try looking online at the store's website. You can either buy online or at least get an idea of what you want to get, that way you don't need to spend too much time shopping around. For what type of clothes, I would say just try on things that you might not usually pick or things you aren't really sure would look good on you. You might be surprised at how different things can look when you're actually wearing them. The only way to change your style is to try new things!
G60Fx995aa	gosto do neve, mas tem outras do mesmo tipomuito boas.

Compro aqueles pacotes que vem oito pela metade do pre?o de quatro. Aqui, nós usamos a ducha, pois usar o papel pode levar infec??es à vagina se n?o souber limpar direito (infec??o urinária), os homens também precisam lavar-se após usar o banheiro, infec??o urinária em homens é muito difícil, a n?o ser as sexuais, porém é muito bom andar sempre limpo. Quando for ao banheiro, n?o se limpa de tráz para frente e sim de frente para tráz. Mas lavar é a melhor coisa, pode até secar com o papel. N?o esquecer de lavar bem as m?os, porque usar o banheiro e n?o lavar as m?os pode levar infec??es e infesta??es por verminoses para vc mesma (auto-infec??o) e para os outros (infec??o cruzada).é muito importante falar sobre higiene, aprender sobre higiene e ensinar sobre higiene, e, sobretudo, praticar higiene. Um abra?o para você e parabéns, uma perguntinha q pode ser interpretada como bobinha, mas deu margem a muitos conhecimentos. Para nós dois. Beijo!!!

Muita gente acha que cortar nos hidratos de carbono é indispensável, mas isso é um conceito errado. Você perde peso queimando a gordura através de exercício físico intenso, se você cortar os hidratos da sua alimenta??o, você ao invés de queimar gordura vai queimar músculo e o resultado n?o vai ser do seu agrado.<br>  Beber água é indispensável, muita água mesmo. Cerca de 3 litros diários. Confirme com o seu médico e ele vai dizer o mesmo que eu. <br>  Há tempos vi na tv uma compara??o entre mulheres europeias e americanas, e a diferen?a era enorme, estando as europeias muito mais magras e saudáveis mesmo em idades mais avan?adas. Isto porque existe a dieta mediterranea, que utlilizamos desde a era romana, e que consiste em refei??es ligeiras, mas diversas e saudáveis. A utiliza??o de gorduras saudáveis como o azeite, muitas ervas aromáticas, saladas, e todo os tipos de alimentos incluíndo p?o, massas. Informe-se mais na internet sobre esta alimenta??o.<br>  Quanto ao exercício, parece que só depois de uma hora é que come?amos a queimar gordura. Se frequenta um ginásio, pe?a que lhe fa?am um plano de exercícios pessoal. Este será feito por um profissional, tendo em conta o seu tipo de corpo, ajudará a tonificar todo o seu corpo, e até a moldar zonas específicas como o traseiro, as coxas, os bra?os, etc.<br>  <br>  Nunca embarque em dietas radicais, nem em qualquer dieta sem a supervis?o do seu médico, porque estas podem ser perigosas, e embora algumas fa?am perder muito peso muito depressa, o mais comum é passado pouco tempo ganhar ainda mais peso. Além disso, porque cortaram nos hidratos de carbono e queimaram músculo, as pessoas que fizeram dietas drásticas ficam muitas vezes com zonas flácidas no corpo.|`|c2lY1SLraa	Olhe, n?o pode fazer essas coisas por qualquer dieta barata, no seu caso, consulte um nutrisionista, e ele vai lher receitar um diépar especialmente para vc e n?o adianta fazer dieta e nos sábados e domingos deixar ela de lado,pois assim você nunca vai conseguir imagrecer.Ok?.<br>  agora vá logo ao nutucionista e uma dica: quando tiver fome e n?o for a hora de alguma refei??o beba água, bastante água.E nas refei??es espermente comer coisas lever e em pequena quantidade e nunca esute NUNCA REPITA O PRATO.|`|twjoWDMkaa	ola...vc vai mesmo muito bem, caminhadas, exercicio, dieta equilibrada,...vc emagrecerá em menos tempo do q imagina..continue assim e perderá alguns quilos..<br>  <br>  bEEEEij?AAAAo!!!!!|`|w7H0yNc5aa	Certa vez, perdi 05 kg em 20 dias - uma semana, vc vai prejudicar sua saude. <br>  Nestes dias, reduzi todo o a?ucar, todo refrigerante, e massas.

aa7fd049bda4d47a6cfaae45774bf41eaa	I too hate my nose! But unfortunately their is no way of getting it smaller [unless you have surgery] which I reccomend you dont do. Your only hope is makeup. You can accentuate another part of your face with makeup [ like your eyes, lips] to draw away attention from the nose && to the eyes or the lips. This works really well, and makes your nose seem smaller!|`|dqvZmj22aa	hmm..  Logic would say that if you stroked it in the other direction, it would shrink.  :-)|`|97f691c6acaef743c7adb448402b18f5aa	There is absolutely no way that you could have made your nose larger, hon. The good thing is, you can make it LOOK smaller without plastic surgery (sorry, no way to shrink it on its own). You want to draw attention away from your nose, so if you use concealer, use a lighter color on the outside edges of your nose. Draw attention to another feature, such as your eyes by applying some makeup there. More good news: you don't have to actually wear makeup if you don't want to. You can achieve subtle differences by how you wear your hair. By having more volume up top, you will lift attention UP not to the middle of your face. If its big as in LONG, then dont wear your hair stick straight. I also wouldn't recommend going completely pulled back into a tail or ponytail as that will make your nose a prominent feature. Do NOT get bangs that end right below your eyebrows. If you absolutely must have bangs, then go for wispy and side swept. Good luck.|`|ElcUgq0kaa	*blink* You stroked it... and it made it large? <br>  Mmhm.<br>  <br>  Well, I don't know of any natural way to make it smaller, but by using your make-up the right way, I'm sure it can make it appear smaller.|`|Kj4fL9hLaa	There is no way to make your nose smaller w/o 'going under the knife.'<br>  Apply a lighter shade of make-up to the bridge of your nose.

3OS8PF6uaa	Oiii.<br>  Se vc vai utilizar uma camisa azul o ideal eh que a gravata seja algo de tom azul!<br>  <br>  Pode ser um tom mais forte que o azul da gravata. <br>  Uma gravata azul com listras prestas (finas)<br>  Ou ao contrario, gravata preta com listras azuis o que é mais fashion ainda e neste caso a listra<br>  Azul pode ser um pouco mais larga, acho que ficaria mais elegante ainda... <br>  Ai n?o tem erro.. vai ficar um gato!<br>  No caso as listras tem que ser na diagonal ok..<br>  <br>  Sempre a gravata tem que estar sempre  combinando com a camisa e o terno. N?o necessariamente<br>  Na mesma cor, mas a gravata pode tanto fazer o gato virar  perfeitamente um príncipe como ao mesmo <br>  Tempo se n?o for escolhida a cor correta, desentoar todo o modelito e fazer o gato virar borralheiro...<br>  <br>  O mundo masculino esta muito fashion ent?o você pode abusar na cor..<br>  Sendo o terno preto pode combinar com camisa rosa...<br>  Mas se vc faz o tipo mais serio, e quer impressionar acredito que uma camisa verde, de preferência verde<br>  Musgo, verde água azulado que é uma cor perfeita com preto ia ficar maravilhoso tbm. Daí a gravata<br>  Segue o estilo ok... poderia ent?o já que o verde um pouco mais escuro combina muito com o preto colocar<br>  Uma gravata verde um tom mais escuro, e até abusar de uma gravata com bolinhas! O que acha?<br>  A também padrinhos que apostam na cor dos vestidos das madrinhas e v?o com gravata combinando com <br>  A cor do vestido, mas nesse caso ou a camisa eh da mesma cor tbm ou preta e soh a gravata combinando.<br>  <br>  Caso o casamento seja muito formal, um fraque entra na historia, mas neste caso você pode até utilizar uma <br>  Gravata borboleta...<br>  Como acredito que n?o seja esta ocasi?o acredito que minhas dicas podem ajuda-lo!<br>  <br>  Ahhh o mais importante querido!!!!<br>  DIVIRTA-SE, se na hora n?o se sentir bem com a roupa aguente a serimonia e espere pela festa, o resto é conversa<br>  O importante eh você aproveitar o momento..<br>  <br>  Boa festa, boa noite de gala e divirta-se..<br>  <br>  bjusss|`|17407cc742ab28d587f12a7e06dd4980aa	Vá ao site da Istoé (<a href="http://www.terra.com.br/istoe/)," rel="nofollow">http://www.terra.com.br/istoe/),</a> selecione na barra superior "on-line" "testes".

Camisa branca ou azul clara é uma boa.<br>  Se usar camisa branca, n?o use gravata preta ou vermelha, sen?o parecerá um gar?on. Opte por outras mais coloridas, como amarela, verde, roxo, vinho, azul, etc.<br>  Prefira as gravatas de seda, s?o um pouco mais caras (2x) mas s?o muito mais vistosas e bonitas.<br>  <br>  A moda agora é de gravatas largas e listadas na diagonal.<br>  <br>  boa festa e parabéns aos noivos.

Good luck ~  :-)|`|OxqvMuLXaa	ya you should razor it and thin it out, much easier to work with.<br>  also with some hilights up in a bun, then if you have the hair thin out bangs as much as possible and razor it across your for head to the side, kind of like different lengths of bang hair soooort of like riana if thats how the **** you spell it lol<br>  but the would look really good blonde and light brown mix of hilights in a bun then razored bangs. hoped this helped at all. your head your hair your call|`|hsJXI9WZaa	<a href="http://www.free-makeup-tips.com/images/thin-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-makeup-tips.com/images/t...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/side-swept-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <a href="http://theglamourouslife.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/celebrity.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://theglamourouslife.com/wp-content/...</a><br>  <br>  any of these should help...|`|MdVtVDAlaa	<a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/celebritypictures/nicole-richie-3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairfinder.com/celebritypictu...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairymaryswigs.com/Samantha1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairymaryswigs.com/Samantha1....</a>|`|4ux7bIFCaa	Yeah, I could answer better if I had a pic.|`|EUxlgwSVaa	show a pic pweeze.|`|6cbb2ed22a5aa8cd52f52f34c0cbf5d9aa	Well here are some styles of bangs-<br>  <br>  You can get short, side-swept wispy bangs.<br>  Like Reese Witherspoon <br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actress/reese-witherspoon/pictures/reese-witherspoon-picture-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/actre...</a><br>  <br>  Or straight wispy bangs like Alexis Bledel.

Or if you have some additional money go to a artist to have your idea drawn up. If you want more info on that let me know I can give you an email address of someone who is amazing.|`|M8reGNt3aa	What tattooist recommend is for people to pick several pictures online for them to get an idea of what you are looking for. They then create something similar to all the pictures you have given them, and that is how you're unique tattoo will form. <br>  You can try google image search, and type in, "flower tattoo" and "butterfly tattoo." There you will found unlimited pictures of what you're looking for. <br>  ex: <a href="http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/K/l/1/paris01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/K/l/1/pa...</a>|`|jWrRXvGwaa	You should get something small. Something that won't be really really vivid. Get a small butterfly or something. Or even a bunch of flowers around your wrist to look like a tattooed bracelet.<br>  <br>  But just to warn you, if you don't pick what you like you will be stuck with it for life. And if you remove it, there will be this green spot where the tattoo was.<br>  <br>  So think it through, or don't get one at all (better choice)|`|MdVtVDAlaa	these?|`|eapYI11aaa	my girl has the hotest flamingo  on her lower back and is to die for... my advice is for you is to go with something unique!|`|WAl0he3Saa	The perfect tattoo would be none at all!!!

First of all, if you color your hair in a blue color, it will fade very quickly with a semi permenant hair color.  If you want something that will last, then I suggest going to a Redken salon.  They have great colors and it adds shine and doesn't damage your hair.  Whatever you do, don't bleach your hair and then deposit the blue color, it will fade to gray in about 3 shampoos.  I honestly suggests seeking a professional for the best result.  Best of Luck!
cdcc5bd1e7cd458a1cc4a95f146da288aa	i prefer Ralph Lauren to AF & Hollister.  and not because of the "true prep" thing. Though that is one reason.  I think the RL is better quality product and more of a timeless classic style.  It never goes out of date. I also would be wearing J. Crew and Brooks Brothers before I would by AF or Hollister.  I would rather have a few items of very good quality than tons of stuff that falls apart or goes out of date.|`|0cCBoYIoaa	I don't really get where you're going with this, if you already know what you like then who cares what random stangers think.|`|L0MMcEyzaa	Ralph Lauren, definitely. A & F is okay (but it's still no RL), and HCO is basically a joke; they're going to go out of style in like 1 more year TOPS. Ralph Lauren (or any other clothing for a true prep) never goes out of style. Think about Aeropostale and American Eagle, they're still somewhat popular brands, but they used to be king of the hill. They had all the business for people who dress like that, and then after like 2 years people switched to Hollister. Give it another year, and Hollister will be taking the back seat to a new (although amazingly similar) brand. Ralph Lauren will never go out of style, and it never has.|`|kJjbdcZHaa	I personally like Ralph Lauren MUCH better. I'm not a "true prep" as you say, I just like their clothes. They fit well, come in really pretty colors, and feel good on your body. <br>  <br>  A&F and Hollister have never gotten my business. I am not a big girl at all, but I find their clothes just don't fit right when I try to get them in my size. They only look good on girls who are size 0-4. <br>  <br>  Both are really expensive, but I'd much rather spend my hard earned money on Ralph Lauren. |`|y0kqLJqsaa	ralph lauren is so calssy i love it!

wgOzHizAaa	They can cost from $50 to $500 a pair. They come in many different styles and some are hand painted (that's where they start to get expensive.) Most you can get in prescription strength.

For hair, just try to keep it simple and sleek but not overly done (maybe down or half up half down?) <br>  Chances are if you like the store you are probably like their "target" customer so you don't have to do too much extra.<br>  Just be professional and try to dress and look neat and sophisticated and you should be good.|`|71DuYJ2Saa	Check out the link <a href="http://www.prepareinterview.com/tips/tipsdressing.asp." rel="nofollow">http://www.prepareinterview.com/tips/tip...</a> It has everything for interview tips and tricks.<br>  <br>  WOMEN<br>   <br>  Three-piece business suits, blouse and skirt or slacks, and cardigan twin-sets.

7VntnQC7aa	Just go to a Sephora or a MAC and ask for help finding a lipstick. They will be very helpful in finding the right shade for you, and in finding exactly what you're looking for.<br>  I think it's worth it to spend a little bit more money on make up. The ingredients are better, and the pigment and color is more rich and stays on a lot longer.<br>  My favorite lipsticks are Benefit and slimshines from MAC.<br>  I think you're only expected to buy something if they make up your whole face...like give you a 'make over'.<br>  <br>  Have fun and good luck!|`|S730dpLfaa	I couldn't exactly get the point of your question, but you can get a free lipstick here before you buy. a free lipstick sample! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://reviewcommunity.org/free_lipstick_sample_online.html" rel="nofollow">http://reviewcommunity.org/free_lipstick...</a>|`|AA10721374	EO I was the queen of cheap lipsticks at one time; but I found that it really didn't save me any money because I had to put it on more often and it was dry.

I absolutely love this line - it's designed for people w/sensitive skin and their lip colors don't contain lead (you don't want that) - which is why those 'all day' wearing lip colors last all day.<br>  The consultants use disposable lip brushes for trying on their lip colors and once the brush has touched your skin, it doesn't go back in/on the product.  Cleanliness is first and foremost - so watch that.|`|69zCK4WNaa	Most make-up counters at dept stores can be pretty snobby in my experience, so make sure you wear nice clothes and have your hair and face clean - dont look shabby and you'll get good service!<br>  <br>  Yeah definitely go for a consultation.  Ask if they do free make-overs.  Alot of them do.<br>  <br>  The stay-on lipsticks are ok, but often feel quite dry and yukky on your lips.  So if I do wear them I always wear a gloss on top.<br>  <br>  Most cheap lipsticks are fine, but some can taste nasty - you'll know when you try them out.<br>  <br>  I actually like to colour in my lips with a fat lip pencil (a moist one) and then just put some nice coloured gloss over the top.  Looks great, and a bit more natural for everyday looks!

Both of these things (sadly) will dry your hair and increase frizz and damage. <br>  My best advice is to learn to work with your curl (I know that can be a challenge ;) ) there are plenty of amazing products out there at the moment which really help to tame curly hair. "Frizz Ease" syrum (available at most places you can get hair products) is a blessing for those of you with curly hair. Apply a 50p sized blob of this stuff (a little goes a long way) to your hair after washing it and distribute it evenly. As you are srying your hair, use a lower speed and heat setting, this will minimise frizz by a lot. If you can, pick up an ionising hairdryer, these are blessings for curly hair. As you're drying, twirl your curls around your finger. Simple, but this will help to define them and minimise frizz. <br>  My next tip is to ensure your shampoo and conditioner is free from silicones. These things dry out the hair and cause frizz and breakage. <br>  Lastly, make sure you're doing a weekly deep condition. This is a great way to inject moisture into curly hair and will help to stop breakage. Ensure you're snipping any split ends with hairdressing scissors as they appear to stop them splitting up the shaft. <br>  Good luck! :)|`|w4g8R55Zaa	do you use a straightener on it? this damages your hair<br>  Coloring your hair also damages it.<br>  <br>  I use PANTEEN PRO-V<br>  Conditioner AND shampoo. After using it it strengthens your hair. There are different kinds depending on what you need.<br>  Moisture/hydration.<br>  Sleek and smooth <br>  ect.<br>  <br>  Also upon using a good shampoo and conditioner, get your hair trimmed and those split ends taken off.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

5w4IvUEYaa	<a href="http://www.youngnails.com/g?t=video" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngnails.com/g?t=video</a><br>  Ok, back now...<br>  First of all, there are a LOT of people out there who think that acrylic nails are bad for you, and that they ruin your nails. One answerer stated that they look trashy and that every time she sees someone's nails after they have been done, they are red from the tech being too 'rough.' BTW, did you see any glue being used to 'hold' the acrylic? Many people think the acrylic is "glued" on. It's not. Glue is used only on plastic nail tips which many good techs do not use at all.  <br>  Well, the simple fact is this: If you go to an experienced,a nd highly skilled technician who uses nothing but the best available acrylic nail products, your nails will not be ruined in the least bit. Nor will they be red from being too 'rough.'<br>  You will read many answers on Y!A that tell you these same things, and more. Where you go to have your nails done plays a MAJOR role in all of this. In order for you to understand what I mean, you need to have a basic understanding of the different types of nail salons in general. It's really pretty simple. There are basically only two different types of salons: The NSS salon (Non-Standard Salon) and salons which use top quality products, and have experienced and skilled technicians who know their job very well, and are truly dedicated to giving you the best possible nail services. These salons will cost more, and will generally require an appointment, but it is so worth it. The nails you get from a good salon are not trashy looking, not fake looking, and certainly will not damage your natural nails.<br>  An NSS (AKA 'Discount' salon) is loosely defined as any nail salon which charges, say, $25-$30 or less for a full set of acrylic nails. They are everywhere these days - in strip malls, in shopping malls, on the street corners of just about every city in America. These are simply salons which do not do nails in ways that would be considered a 'standard,' or traditional. This is the type of salon that people go to who complain that their nails have been ruined, or that they are in pain during, or after the nails have been applied. Avoid this type of salon at all costs. Seek out a highly reputable salon with top notch technicians. One more thing that is important is that there is not a language barrier between you, and the nail technicians. If there is one, it is very difficult to have any of your questions/concerns addressed and that can lead to many problems for you, or anyone who goes to one of these techs. You need to be able to clearly communicate with the technician. That is very important, IMO.<br>   It's always best to be well informed prior to going to any nail salon. This way you can be certain you are getting not only your money's worth. but also that your personal health is not in jeopardy in any way either.<br>  <a href="http://www.beautytech.info/articles/WhatToLookNailSalon.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautytech.info/articles/What...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.beautytech.info/articles/mmafacts.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautytech.info/articles/mmaf...</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctld8mTZoGI&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctld8mTZo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVqujA_iIwA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVqujA_iI...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlmptKm4lA&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rlmptKm4...</a><br>  Here is another video of acrylic nails being applied...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omon9ccUKzI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Omon9ccUK...</a><br>  I hope this helps...<br>  PS: It is not a fungus which grows under improperly applied acrylic nails, its normally a simple bacterial infection. Fungus rarely grows on fingernails, and is normally found on toenails instead. Anyway, the bacterial infection can be caused by water, or moisture that becomes trapped between the nail enhancement and the natural nail. Or is can be from the tech using dirty files and implements on your nails. Proper sanitation and disinfection is very important in a nail salon. Be sure that wherever you go to have your nails done that they are spotless, and that they use new files on every customer and also disinfect any and all implements between uses on each customer.|`|O0V7xUOnaa	I don't have video but I used to get it done.  Here is a general idea:<br>  <br>  . Glue on fake nails to get length<br>  . Cut to desired length<br>  . Paint on glue for acrylic<br>  . Use little paintbrush to get acrylic powder wet and it makes little balls<br>  . Pat little ball on top of nail<br>  . Paint on white<br>  . Clear coat<br>  <br>  This is just a general idea and there are two ways to get french manicure this is acrylic and there is 'pink and white' where the powder is two different colors. There is A LOT of drilling to get them formed and they need a flat surface for glue to stick so they file your nail down very thin (which is why it took me forever to get normal nails).  I decided not to do it anymore because of the price, pain and time.  But they are pretty :-)  |`|KG08AlXFaa	My sister has acrylic nails with a french manicure! She loves them, but the problem is that they are not good for your nails. They ruin your natural nails. Also, if you don't get the nails done every week, a fungus can grow under it. The fungus is when water builds under the acrylic nail because you haven't gotten them done in a while so they start to come up. |`|FkXt4XLvaa	I have never had these done as every time I see someone's nails after they've had a manicure, they are so red and they always say the person was really rough. I don't trust my hands in anyone else's grip!<br>  <br>  Plus, frankly, I think they look trashy. Even if the person is not so. You can tell they aren't real and if you are going to a wedding where the bride may possibly have hers done like this, it would be tasteless to have yours done the same way unless you are a part of the wedding and that's what she requested.<br>  <br>  If your nails are that bad, try soaking them in warm water with lavender oil (or soap) for a few days, filing them down to just a bit over where it turns white on its own and then putting just a gloss on them...or maybe a light pink or flesh tone.<br>  <br>  YouTube has a selection of videos to watch on getting them done. Here's the page I found when I typed it into the search engine:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=acrylic+nails&search_type=&aq=f" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_qu...</a>

1yn3CMfcaa	Waxing will keep stubble at bay for a week. Using a depilatory like Nair is very similar to just shaving because the hair is disolved only at the surface and the hair will be noticeably back within 3-4 days.

It has to be EXTRA virgin olive oil so it won't clog your pores. This works on me and if it dosen't irratate your skin, use it everyday. After your shower, Your legs will be very very smooth and sikly because the grainy texture of the sugar sloughs away the dry skin, making it very soft and silky. Remember to apply alot of cream onto your legs after you this.|`|nHoIAxTOaa	I have an epillator that leaves them smooth for much longer than shaving...but be prepared for the "ouchiness" until you become less sensitive to having your hairs yanked out by the roots! ;)|`|rj6uPNoIaa	Try using removable hair cream like Nair.

You don't need to do this on the first day, but if you want it to be keep smooth, use lotion on your legs.

5o7ttdRcaa	My advice is to not perm your hair again. Perms are an old fashioned way to give your hair body and/or curl. It doesn't matter if you call it a "body wave" or "spiral perm" the chemical used is the same and extremely damaging to the hair shaft. If you are trying to acheive body and fullness, you should ask your hair stylist to give you some natural highlights. .the bleach used will swell the hair shaft and give your hair a less damaging lift. Also, the highlights should be placed at the crown of your head only. This will give your hair depth. Perms don't just swell the hair shaft, they eventually fry it. After a few perms, your hair could get brittle and frizzed. I would deep condition my hair once a week and speak to a trusted hair stylist before making any changes. <br>  If you MUST perm it again, I would say to be sure and deep condition your hair bi-weekly before and after you perm it. Hair should also never be double processed. Permed and colored..now that's asking for trouble. Good luck girl! :)|`|Y8OHLoBiaa	Perms are never okay!|`|swIxAzlkaa	you have to w8 6 months 2 get it redone (thats when you 1st get it) you have to wait another 2 weeks

PvgpnU42aa	I wouldn't color your whole head, but I suggest going with some redish highlights. Red highlights look gorgeous! Or, you could go with some caremel hightlights! Make sure when you go to the salon, you ask for dyes with no annomia. If you are set on dyeing all your hair, then go for demi-perminate dyes.

That would be pretty expensive but go over to a friends house and use some of her stuff. See how it works, and just keep trying new things. Hair may work with products from this company and not that company....it's all trial and error. <br>  <br>  If I can suggest something, I would suggest you try a hot oil treatment....for a cheaper way to have great soft and silky hair with less frizzies, warm up some olive oil (regular cooking stuff) in the microwave and massage it into your hair while it is dry. Wrap it up in a warm towel from the drier and sit for an hour or so. Maybe give yourself a facial at the same time. Then get in the shower, and shampoo out all the oil (because water won't get the oil out--oil and water don't mix) and then condition your hair. Viola! Beautiful silky hair. <br>  <br>  The most key thing to protecting your locks is to stay away from all heat. Yep, that means no hairdrier, no straightner, no curling iron either....It's very hard not to advert to these products but just try it for a week. Don't blow dry your hair for a week....try it. I know it's hard not to but if you stay away from things with heat such as blow driers, curling irons, straightners, etc....you will notice a HUGE change in the feel and look of your hair. It will be so much more healthy.
nBPDzBktaa	funny u posted this question..doing the same with mine..if u want to go from dark to light, a completly different color like from black to  the chesnut, you WILL have to bleach and bleaching is rough on hair  but u can just condition  condition and use more conditioners..you did the right thing by going to a hair consult. It also depends on if you have have virgin hair (never colored your hair before) take the professionals advice and let them do the work. It's money well spent.|`|2fHWcAdFaa	if its not colored you can get from jet black to medium /light brown with out bleach, but it will be itchy, they need to use a strong color which makes most people itchy. if you have it colored black, then youre screwed basically, slowly start getting light brown highlights and keep getting them till its almost all light brown. bleach its crazy harsh and NOT required if your hair isn't colored yet.you can get from black to a chocolate brown *if theres no color in there* without bleach, she is an old school stylist, find a new one.|`|DYo9d4I1aa	no you just need to get high lights.|`|O4mPJQlkaa	huh, he/she just wants your money.

Li2m8TZ0aa	Try mixing up your outfits by wearing funky accessories and bright bags. You can bring the accessories in your bag and put them on when you leave your job if they are in the way. Sometimes all an outfit needs is a cute hat and some bangles. I get tons of bright/fun bags at Goodwill and Forever 21 is good for cheap but nice accessories. Little barets and bonnets are very in right now so they are easy to find. H&M has really cute ones. I got a houndstooth one there last week.

qz8HPq4Gaa	i just got my hair cut today. My hair is really thick and wavy too. I got my hair about shoulder length, and with side bangs (not across the forehead, but with a center part, down the side of the face). I have found that layering just makes my hair look thicker than it already is.. and I would rather have thinner looking hair than big hair.. My hair stylist kind of angled the front edges of my hair from long bang length all the way to the full length. <br>  <br>  I have a squarish face, and it looks really cute. I dont know what shape face you have, but this hairstyle is pretty on a lot of face shapes. <br>  <br>  Then after you have it cut, use "aquage thermal styling" spray and straighten your hair. <br>  <br>  I'm 14, and i went shopping after i got my hair cut and I got a lot of compliments. So I hope this helps!|`|hEPgUrVHaa	<a href="http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb53/xella_photosx/e2f89126.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i206.photobucket.com/albums/bb53/...</a>|`|889951feacbda6f3efb190bb47fd0597aa	length:to you shoulder<br>  layers:below you cheek bone<br>  bangs:side bangs|`|8f5600cb238ad968d721d77bee05be5faa	check out www.haircut.net<br>  <br>  Or www.cropsforgirls.com|`|Ve8Eh9Hlaa	umm shoulder high cut layered ya i had the same hair but i cut it like i told you and it makesnthe face stand out :]]|`|pijdb3zPaa	<a href="http://www.brides.com/images/editorial/2006_online/10_slideshows/02_beauty_hairtop51/00_main/045_primary.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.brides.com/images/editorial/2...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/gallery/images/long_hairstyles_01_01.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstylesdesign.com/gallery/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wigsalon.com/img/thumb/platinum106t.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.wigsalon.com/img/thumb/platin...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wigs-us.com/ebaypics/777-1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.wigs-us.com/ebaypics/777-1.jp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.glamourhair.com/images/pophairextensions/HH-ClipIn-Extensions---Wavy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.glamourhair.com/images/pophai...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.askmen.com/galleries/singer/carrie-underwood/pictures/carrie-underwood-picture-6.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.askmen.com/galleries/singe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://urbanupdater.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/nicole-richie-in-eley-kishimoto.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://urbanupdater.files.wordpress.com/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/tips/longhairfringe.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairfinder.com/tips/longhairf...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/2315/2005qw5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/2315/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stylebakery.com/celebstyle/mischa.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.stylebakery.com/celebstyle/mi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.timeinc.net/people/i/2006/specials/globes06/show/bwhair/jalba.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.timeinc.net/people/i/2006/spe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x283/yukina_san/ayumihamasaki.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i185.photobucket.com/albums/x283/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/U/I/nicoler.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/U/I/nico...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gabrielhair.co.uk/images/4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.gabrielhair.co.uk/images/4.jp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/I/I/shorth5.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/beauty/1/0/I/I/shor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g119/narsobsessed/NewestStuff/trendnicole.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i54.photobucket.com/albums/g119/n...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.1haircuts.com/haircuts/Windy%20City.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.1haircuts.com/haircuts/Windy%...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairuwear.com/ftp/blue.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairuwear.com/ftp/blue.jpg</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.salonestique.com/tcfiles/cms/385560378819444.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.salonestique.com/tcfiles/cms/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.more-hairstyles.com/long/l17.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.more-hairstyles.com/long/l17....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairuwear.com/ProdImages/Layered-Straight-PIP_03.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairuwear.com/ProdImages/Laye...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/specials/summer_fashion/hair_tips/jacinda_barrett.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/sp...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celoxdesign.net/images/tutorials/36/1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.celoxdesign.net/images/tutori...</a><br>  <br>  I hope that these helped you out!|`|xB9GEzHZaa	Layers, round the face only though.

tHgudIXzaa	I am sorry I can't tell you wear to get them.  But I wanted to tell you what it is like to wear them.  I had a pair from a beauty supply store but they stopped carrying them.  They looked nice but they put a lot of pressure on your earlobes.  If I put them on the wrong spot they seemed to push on a nerve.  It takes some experimentation to find the right spot.  Even then wearing them all day might be a bit much.  If you have a credit card I would search for them online and buy them there.

Nothing to shiny or it will just grease you up. Use a tiny bit and rub it into your fingers until you don't see the color (or else you have to much). Rub through your hair and work your hair around. Try different "messy" looks and styles. This should help get you over the I need a hair cut right now feeling.<br>  Also you are actually supposed to get haircuts while growing out your hair. Just not as often. You may just want to go in about every 8 weeks or so and just have someone trim up your neck and around your ears. It really cleans up and messy haircut.
a57bbf7fb0ee09e249416e26bf24ad12aa	There is a such thing as a relaxer, which basically is a straight perm and is sometimes refered to as a perm. Relaxers are best left to the professionals and sometimes you can't trust them with a relaxer. Trust me on this one. I just recently got my hair cut extremely short and am growing it out naturally (without any chemical processes), due to severe relaxer damage. When I was twelve I got a relaxer. Pre-relaxer,I had hair to the middle of my back. The relaxer straightened my hair to about an inch below my waist. Then all of a sudden my hair began to break off at the ends and approx. 3 months later I had loss over a foot of hair. <br>  NO JOKE! The chemicals in relaxers can be very damaging and drying, and your hair will probably need more work and effort, after getting a relaxer than without one. I have been told by other hairdressers that the hairdresser who originally put mine in may have mixed a relaxer and a curly perm together (A BIG NO-NO). Plus relaxers can get expensive. where I live they usually cost about $60-$80/ per relaxer application, and you have to get them done about every 1-3 months so they do get expensive ( and that's not including getting your hair cut and styled). I know girls with hair like yours and what they do is they straighten their hair with a ceramic straightening iron and as long as you take good care of your hair, it's something that can last for usually 1-2 weeks. It's much cheaper than a relaxer and much more healthier for your hair.|`|wy5SiCS2aa	just use a straightening iron on it, don't put any chemicals in it -that will damage your hair so bad! That way if you want it curly sometimes you just don't use the iron that day.|`|DjPeTaciaa	Well there is no such thing as a straight perm but you can get a relaxer which is then same thing but permenent until your roots grow in.

You should be able to still tong your hair to give it a curl without it staying curly.

0d0706a200db4391c1ff8a757730735faa	How to Start a Clothing Line from scratch?<br>  <br>  Article By Michael J. Harper – Co-author of the Official 3 Book Course on Starting a Clothing Line which consist of The Official Step by Step Guide to Starting a Clothing Line, The Reality of Owning and Operating Your Own Clothing Line and How to Effectively Sell Your Clothing Line to Retailers.<br>  <br>  Many people have always asked my partner and I, “How can I start my own clothing line?” There really wasn't a simple answer that we could just reply with. Despite what some may have people to believe, starting a clothing line is a special business model. Sure the normal business model of registering your business as a D.B.A. or LLC apply and opening a bank account apply but there is so much more to the formula. In this article, I will go over some of the most important points.<br>  <br>  The name of your clothing line is everything. Choose a name that best represents you now and where you would like to go in the future with your clothing line. The next thing or even the first thing you should do at this exact moment is get your web site name for your clothing line. Web sites names are going super fast so get your today’s for as little as $10. We recommend the service below because they are one of the cheapest on the internet when it comes to getting a domain name. Use the link below to see if your name is available. If it is, Register it now!<br>  Register a domain name for your clothing line at GoDaddy.com $1.99 Domain Names Today  <br>   <br>  <br>      * Next, do a search trademark search for your name. If it is available - register it with the United States Trademark Office (about $325).<br>      * Go to your city clerk office and register your business and then open a bank account in your business name.<br>      * Now you should be thinking about what type of clothes you want to make first. Do you want to start with T-shirts, jeans etc. Keep your scope limited at first until you build a name for yourself.<br>      * Buy a fashion design program like Digital Fashion Pro to lay out your fashion designs with (www.DigitalFashionPro.com). Get all of your sketches together and figure out which ones you want to produce first. Show them to friends and family and see which ones people like the most. Next you can use your professional sketches to give to a seamstress, manufacturer, or screen printer who can make your designs for you. (Read article on fashion design software and the fashion design process)<br>      * Next decide how you want to get your clothing made. Do you want to mass produce or just produce a few to see how things go. Producing locally or within the US. is your best bet for small production runs. Use the internet to find contractors or by contractors listing to help you.<br>      * How much money does it cost to start a clothing line? The answer to this question is different for everyone. First you should make your business plan and determine how much money you need to get your line off the ground. To do this, you should find out how much a production run will cost, advertising etc. Coming up with the capital to launch your clothing line can be tricky depending on your situation. Keep this in mind; banks traditionally don't give loans for clothing lines because it is an intangible business. Banks will loan you money if you have collateral such as a house to put up. The Official Guide Book offers creative ways to finance your clothing line plus a better understanding of exactly what it will cost you to get started.<br>      * Now that your clothing is being made it very important that your contractor / manufacturer deliver you quality goods and on time.<br>      * Branding. As a clothing line owner, you have to think about new ways to brand your line everyday. It is important that you give consumers and store owners a reason why they should choose to support your line. Make sure you stand out. Being different and unique is a good thing in the fashion industry.<br>      * Now that you have goods on the way. Begin taking orders for these items if you haven't already. When my partner and I started our line, we would go to summer festivals, church festivals etc. and rent booths to sell our line. One summer we made over $15,000 selling T-shirts. T-shirts are actually an excellent way to market your line. Sell your items to any and everyone you know. People will see them wearing it and ask how they can order. Make sure you offer deals if people buy more than one. This is called building a local selling network. Once you have a network that loves your clothes you can always sell them your new releases. Make sure you maintain a contact list of all of your customers. This is good for cash flow.<br>      * Where can I sell my clothing? First think about putting your line in local stores. Make appointments with them to go in and show the buyer your line. After getting your line in stores locally and learning how things work you can then move on to thinking about national distribution.<br>      * How to Marketing a Clothing Line. Marketing is an essential step in the success of your clothing line. People must know you exist. Make sure you have a professional looking web site first and foremost. Make sure you put out a press release about your line. You can also advertise your line online and in magazines etc. One thing you must have is post cards. Make sure you blanket your city with post cards that advertise your clothing line. The important thing is to build buzz and momentum surrounding your clothing line. Contact your local radio stations and see if you can get them to interview you. You can also think about attending local and national clothing trade shows like Magic International (www.magiconline.com). Attending clothing trade shows that will put you right in front of clothing buyers is the way to go to distribute your line nationally.<br>      * Management. Manage your money, your orders, production, delivery and everything else about your line to perfection. Believe it or not, this is where most new clothing lines falter. Resources like www.startingaclothingline.com was created to help fashion entrepreneurs develop solid strategies to advance their fashion lines and ideas.<br>      * The thing about starting a clothing line is that you must have the passion for it. Sleep, eat and breathe it. Nothing feels better than seeing others wearing your creations. Making money off those creations feels even better. Make sure you have adequate price points on your merchandise that will allow you to make money via wholesale and direct to consumer.|`|6j20wOTcaa	learning how 2 spell and uhh idk
ptRButDmaa	I don't think that you will get a good purple on top of the red, and highlighting and then dyeing sounds like a disaster waiting to happen. Your hair is taking a beating every time you mess with it - why not just dye it black and then leave it for a while.<br>  I presume you will be going to the hairdressers for the extensions? They might be hard to do yourself!|`|qeiMXf71aa	Did you yell at them after they did that to you? That's pretty wrong for them not even to ask you "hey, we don't have that color, do you want your hair red?"....<br>  <br>  I would say strip the color out, but I heard that can make your hair look and feel shitty. Hmmm, I would say maybe dye it a lighter or darker red and then dye the top purple and the bottom black.<br>  <br>  I know you say that you don't trust hairstylist anymore, but for this type of hair you should. It's very complicated and if you want it to look good then go to a salon. Just not the one you went to before. Just because one dude or chick makes a mistake doesn't mean others do. Some are actually really good at what they do. :]<br>  <br>  or if you don't want to get your hair done by a professional again, then just call them and ask what they think you should do.|`|1MNZHNOvaa	Wait for a like a month coz if u dye ur hair agen it will jus fall out, then put prelightner in ur hair or bleach it then u cn start agen n add what ever colour u wnt it work 4 my friend xx gud luck with it|`|59dab329f020fb9d384d24e1de1edc75aa	you're so punk. getting purple hair at the hairdresser... maybe you'd like to set up a spa day to get tattooed?|`|CRXU1Sblaa	go hairdresser, u will muck ur hair up trust  me!|`|CkPQCZqpaa	I think it sounds good if you dye it all black at get the top purple. <br>  If your serious about getting a purple colour, I would dye your whole head black, and then bleach the parts where you want purple. I do this kind of thing all the time, and the best thing to do is separate sections and put them into small hair ties, i usually have 5 or 6, but it depends on how thick your hair is. <br>  Then you dye the hair that are in the pony tails. <br>  <br>  If you wanted to have lighter and darker colours, I would get 2 bottles of the purple/plum colour you like, and get a small bottle of bleach, and if you have any black left from your dye, then use some of that, if not it doesn't matter. <br>  <br>  Separate each bottle in half, and add a small amount of bleach/white to one, a bit more in another, a small bit of black in another, and leave one normal, try and get a little more of the normal colour separated from the rest because the others will have black, or bleach colours added to them, making more dye. <br>  Colour half of each layer that is separated from the rest of your head with the original colour, and leave the rest for the custom colours. I would probably do it with strands all the way around, because if you split the sections in half, and dyed one half purple and one half a lighter or darker purple would look really weird. When your done, take out the hair ties and touch up the roots with whatever colour is closest to the designated area. <br>  <br>  <br>   I would recommend www.hottopic.com for hair dyes, for me it works the best.  (: <br>  <br>  I hope your hair turns out babe! (:|`|WBAGArH7aa	It sounds like you're trying to do a lot to your hair all at once.  If by "colorzapping" you mean bleaching, I would be very careful doing that on your own and after you have just had your hair dyed.  This is for 2 reasons.  1) Depending on your hair type, you may not be able to get any type of coloring to stick in your hair if it is already damaged.  If your hair feels "mushy" when you get it wet...STOP and don't do anything else to it.   2)  If it's not already "mushy" you might make it that way by first bleaching your hair and then putting dye in it again before your hair has been able to recover.<br>  <br>  I know you don't want advice about hairdressers BUT If you really do hate the color, hairdressers have a solution that will take out whatever dye is in your hair and return it to it's natural color (minus bleaching errors).  I made a serious mistake to my own hair with permanent dye and the hairdresser was able to return it to my natural color.  Worth every penny!  <br>  <br>  Just don't overwork your hair because you might make it fall out or, just as bad, start breaking off.|`|qSWoZatoaa	this is a good way to do it......i dyed my hair dark brown and burgundy not to long ago. my sister did it. tell you the truth its a lot better getting someone you know and trust to do it not going to a hairdresser cuz they dont listen. i dyed my hair the brown and streaked it burgundy and put burgundy tips also. what you should do is go to a store get the permanant colors you want and get someone besides the hairdresser to do it. i think that you should dye it black and streak it burgundy or the other way around. its up to you. but if you get the color at a store it will work i promise!|`|thWIahDwaa	i wouldn't do extensions yourself but as for the color - you will get better and truer colors to what you are looking for if you at least use permanent colors instead of demi / semi permanent.  there are some good colors if you go to the beauty supply store - the vivid colors that the punks and goths use is great.  i would just follow the directions - maybe get a friend to help you like with the back and make sure it's separated the way you want and all the hair is colored...

I dont know what it is called, but just telling them what kind of hair style you want wouldnt be that helpful to them because every hair stylist does it differently. You could end up with the wrong hair cut. Your best bet would be to just print it out & take it to a salon.|`|itWQfuIqaa	How about an "asymmetrical pixie" cut?|`|k4dAtVazaa	theres no specific name for it its just cute short hair. try punky short hair. but yeah it doesnt have a name|`|2jnFhr1laa	the "rihanna"<br>  <br>  victoria beckham started it.<br>  <br>  just print it out and take it to the hair salon|`|r21WSgqRaa	a bob haircut?? maybe. idk =P

The way your hair is now layered like it good.|`|KQq4BqkFaa	i love the length and the way it sits for your face. i would try to keep the lenght but put in some shorter layers and try adding color. if you're willing to be a bit risky, maybe a brown-red or someother lowlights would look really good. and if you ant to stick with something more careful, try adding both a lighter and darker brown to your hair. just recently, i was getting a trim and right as i was about to go up, she asked me, "what are we going to do today?" i had been kind of going for maybe side bangs or layers cut to look kind of like bangs, but i stopped when she asked me and i went "i want those bangs that go straight across" very last second, but i do love my bangs. i didn't plan it, and maybe that last second inspiration will happen for you or help to look out for that when you go to do...whatever. good luck! :)|`|jkIowN8daa	Maybe you should straighten your bangs and then  curl the rest like this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/anna-jonas/2284736506/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/anna-jonas/...</a><br>  <br>  Here is some more that ma help<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Simple-and-Cute-Hairstyles" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Do-Simple-and-Cut...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Hot%2C-Simple-Hairstyles" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Hot%2C-Simple...</a><br>  <br>  Or some buns<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Special:LSearch?fulltext=Search&search=hairstyle+bun" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Special:LSearch?f...</a><br>  <br>  Or some vannessa hudgens hair this is the link to all of them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?p=vanessa+hudgens&fr=yfp-t-501&toggle=1&cop=mss&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <br>  Also ashley tisdale<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images;_ylt=A0WTbx_QrpdIHREBfY2JzbkF?p=ashley+tisdale&fr=yfp-t-501&ei=utf-8&js=1&x=wrt">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bosshairstyles.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bosshairstyles.com</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautyriot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyriot.com</a><br>  <br>  I would add more but you know this stupid new format and you can only add 10 websites<br>  <br>  email me at samelilgurl0923@yahoo.com|`|RxLSxs6Zaa	i think you should grow out your hair long :P|`|zkz7A7Wfaa	honestly i think you look great now.

If you have blue eyes it will make them pop so much!  <br>  <br>  As for the style I dont really want to give you a picture because I can just describe it.  Get your hair cut just above your shoulders and give it bunches of layers and straighten it and blow dry it.  <br>  <br>  If you want some suggestions on styling products I use Nexxus.  When I get out of the shower I towel dry it spray Nexxus heat protection spray then put mousse in my hair and sometimes I use the straightening spray to make my hair more straight.

I'm not sure where to get them. I just suggest to walk around every store in the mall that sells shoes and also go to other places that sells shoes and look for it. Maybe even bring a picture to the shoe stores and ask if they know themselves where to get them.<br>  Goodluck!|`|BXtkjrh1aa	That is the sharpest shoe I have seen lately damn i want to know where we can all get them so I hope someone knows I will go looking also and If I find where to get them i will definitely tell you do you know the price?

My hair is one inch and I can't braid or even flat twist it. You might be able to do tiny twists or those tiny plaits. My hair is naturally curly so I just wear a small curly fro and since it's getting longer I add some thin headbands, but other than the styles you mentioned, I can't do anything with it. You can gel it down using a soft gel, it'll look nice if you have curly, coily, or wavy hair (I haven't seen what it looks like on hair that has no curl definition). I haven't tried it myself, but I've seen pictures of other girls who do it and it looks nice (it gives the hair a lot of waves). I don't like putting gel in my hair so that's why I haven't tried it, yet. 
ruUDr1Yaaa	You should tease it.

qFYM6GFtaa	Gosh your hair is soo so pretty now. I would keep it the same, or if you really want a change then add some layers, but i really like your long hair better than the short ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  :)|`|AcsML4Leaa	you shouldnt do either of the two styles i think.. you may regret having it all cut offf. <br>  i would say keep it the length itt is noww && then add a side fringe and choppy layers, go for some really short layers too cos if you wanted a short hair cut, this can be instead of it,<br>  hope i helped:)<br>  x|`|SRT5rMSHaa	don't cut all that hair off  get it cut to your mid back or something|`|A4yM2qc4aa	i like the 2nd one, but maybe not in the color red...before you cut your hair make sure you reeeallllly wanna do it though, because my hair was a bit past shoulder length and when the hairdresser cut off too much it felt like the end of the world to me =P|`|gQu7WbJcaa	i think that you should cut your hair a lot... but not that much.. work with what you have gradually.. you'll probally regret cutting it all off.. that's what happened with me.. go for something at your shoulders..|`|oaQCONT8aa	i personally think the second haircut would look best on you!!! it would bring some color and life into your hair!!! it also look really really pretty on you!!!! :]<br>  <br>  <br>      i hope every thing works out great for you and good luck!!!|`|ruUDr1Yaaa	I don't think either one suits you too well.|`|SJ0gw8Iiaa	You could first try something like this: <a href="http://i216.photobucket.com/albums/cc320/redheaded_nollie/hair/Women_medium_layered_hairstyle_with.jpg." rel="nofollow">http://i216.photobucket.com/albums/cc320...</a> That way it's not so drastic and overwhelming for you. <br>  <br>  BUT, if you really wanna get a short haircut I think number Two would look great on you. But I would be careful about the hair color, you don't want a nasty contrast between your regular style, skin, and hair.<br>  <br>  Be sure to ask the guy who's doing your hair what color and style would be best as well.   Luck!|`|9x8ryDv6aa	try side bangs and shoulder length if not a bit shorter.<br>  Those haircuts are hideous. <br>  You're pretty so why make yourself look ridiculous??|`|DcK5N0cNaa	the second one.<br>  you lookm really good with dark hair but idk about the length of the second one. i would go a bit longer maybe past ur neck but not as long as ur hair is now.|`|dnXRf4Gwaa	wow! ur hair is so long!! Um ok,how do i say this nicely,both these hair styles r rlly ugly,y dont u just get layers or something?That would look pretty!!|`|Z6B2ib0faa	i think you should go short gradualy as u may regret it if you get it all chopped off at once :) x|`|eKNHfPmUaa	the second one and you would look super cute with dark hair!
75a2f2fba5591ccd80c4c0170857a8ddaa	What you need is a salt/sugar scrub. You can mix sugar or salt with almond oil and rub it gently on your elbows and knees. Is also said that if you rub lemon on your elbows and knees it will help a lot. <br>  <br>  If you still looking to whiten your elbows faster, sorry but I really don't know the right answer. But watch out for those harsh chemicals on skin whiteners because it can solve a problem but also create a permanent damage.<br>  <br>  Good luck !
9QyXzqTZaa	here's a similar from a dress like gossip girl site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dlgg.oh-aspiration.org/Jenny%20Humphrey/Season%20Two/Behind%20the%20Scenes/jhbts1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://dlgg.oh-aspiration.org/Jenny%20Hu...</a>|`|v2KhcpJfaa	You won't be able to fin the exact dress because it was made specifically for the show by the costume designer.
l8mVLwI1aa	uhh, have a relaxed attitude because it takes patience. eat healthy & drink plenty of milk. it worked for me,<br>  also if you want to buy something at the story for about $7, you can buy sally hansen's nail growth or nutra nail green tea growth treatment for nails.<br>  that worked on me too ! you can also notice your nail growing. it also makes your nail stronger from getting chipped off or broken.|`|au9MvNQDaa	Take iron capsules.. It works, all the ladies I know that have taken them when they were pregnant got really nice long hard nails!|`|Ipnnj07uaa	dip it in onion juice|`|bcd173d35993f0ffa9da4f1c985072e1aa	apricot oil will help your cuticles and nails.  i don't know if it really makes them grow faster, but they might be healthier-- that's a start.  also, drink lots of milk ( my aunt swears by it for quick-growing and strong nails).<br>  vitamin e, too.  you can actually buy vitamin e in vitamin form, then just use the tip of a a knife (carefully, please) to cut open or puncture (i guess you could use a pin, too) a hole in the vitamin capsule.  the stuff inside is raw vitamin e that you can rub onto/into your skin and nails and its great for them. also, when your cuticles are softened, pushed down, and well-trimmed, it exposes more of your nail-bed which makes your nails look longer.  this really works. good luck! if you see a manicurist, ask them to pay particular attention to trimming down your cuticles.  if you do it at home, soak your hands in warm water for a while until your cuticles are soft.  then put some cuticle softener on there (ask at a pharmacy or beauty supply store-- it comes in a little tube).  apply that and then wait 5 minutes or so and you should be able to brush the cuticle away with an old (but clean) toothbrosh or nailbrush.  good luck!|`|ZvZE6HM1aa	A lot of people have genetically weak nails; I get it from my mom's side of the family.  I don't know of any homemade remedies to make them longer, but you can influence them somewhat by what you ingest.  Take Hair & Nail Vitamins.  I can't remember some names off my head, but you can find many formulas at GNC or online.|`|DrrlCBKiaa	i dont know but i really wish i did know!|`|UbM3d1cSaa	eat a lot of geletin|`|sla8l2wuaa	There is alot of B*** S*** when it comes to growing nails.<br>  Take Vitiamin E tablets and Zinc (This will aslo be good for your skin and hair) Get a cuticle cream, or massage oil and rub into your cuticles everytime you think about it. Keep some by your bed, some in the car, some in your handbag. This will make the cuticles healthy and with out healthy cuticles, you cant have healthy nails. <br>  Get regluar manicures (if you can afford it) file you nails in one dircetion, towards the middle. Try not to see saw, this will cause them to split. Use a nail strenghtner (Revitanail is good) and try not to do work that will put stress on them (gardening, washing up, etc)<br>  But moslty be patient, it wont happen over night, but if you keep with it you will notice a big difference.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  <br>  xXx|`|69zCK4WNaa	rub a little olive oil in them every day.<br>  <br>  also flick each of your nails with your thumb in turn - make it a habit - it increases blood flow to the nails.  Someone told me about this ages ago and I did it for a while and it seemed to work!!<br>  <br>  avoid Nail Varnish/Polish completely (I'm not talking about special nail-strengtheners here - just colour)  They are the worst for weakening your nails when you are trying to grow them.<br>  <br>  Don't file your nails to a point, keep them relatively square.  Dont push your cuticles down when you're trying to grow your nails either.<br>  <br>  Eat lots of carrots for the best source of calcium (better than milk in fact!)|`|mrkVrDmfaa	prenatal vitamins<br>  BUT i'm scared to use them because they help ur hair grow too<br>  & i don't want hair in funny places, know what i mean??<br>  <br>  <br>  AS A RESPONSE TO SOMEONE ABOVE ME------^<br>  iron does NOT make ur nails grow, i take iron b/c i'm anemic.<br>  iron helps the development of red blood cells-nothing to do with nails!<br>  i'm pretty sure those pregnant people had long nail b/c they had to take PRENATAL VITAMINS!! <br>  & u can OD on too much iron, <br>  sounds crazy but its true so if u don't need extra iron,<br>  then i don't think u should take supplements of something u don't need b/c it could be bad for u.<br>  just wanted u to know<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  &sorry, i have OCD with correcting people:D|`|MaiEYBnoaa	At walmart u can buy Mane-and-Tail (its for horses) rub it on ur cuticules twice a day.

KYZAymECaa	Well it all depends on what you look like... in my opinion dresses #1 & #2 were just far too busy. #4 was okay; it just didn't look that comfortable. #5 was 2nd fav but the bow looked like it could be trouble. I personally really like dress #3 though, very classic, simple, yet innovative, nostalgic, and sophisticated. Remember, graduation is a HUGE day and it's important to wear something you will like. People will be taking pictures and someday you may look back on those pictures and you'll want to reflect on what a great dress that was instead "why did I wear THAT?!" The choice is yours. Have fun at graduation! Congrats!|`|YXm0C5ujaa	pick between 3 and 4 those will be ur best =]|`|ReHJAUfRaa	i personally like 2.

It's more conservative and appropriate for the occasion since it is a formal event.  The other ones just seem like party dresses, especially strapless ones.|`|Mem0OQbTaa	number 3 is simple and elegant, and in the same time sexy.<br>  <br>  number 4 downright sexy and sophisticated <br>  <br>  number 5 is simple but attractive..<br>  <br>  I'd go for number 4.|`|96ojhoXvaa	They all look a little to revealing for a graduation but I like number 3 and 5.|`|fpqoQcP2aa	the last one is the only one i like.

SUPER cheap!!! and some shirts there are like $3!|`|hdoOcMFNaa	forever 21 is the BEST store. all the stuff is cute and super cheap and you can mix and match different things|`|uFBXM4rIaa	although it seems like the ugliest things go to clearance, its not always true. sometimes if you look hard enough you can find really cute and cheap stuff. <br>  well for jeans, you can go to forever 21 and get jeans for like 12.80 each so that is pretty cheap. get a couple of basic tees which only go for like 4 dollars and you can layer them to look cute. get a couple of solid colored tanks also to wear with the tees. get a nice cardigan to top a simple outfit off. and really, just keep your eyes open to sales and coupons, that should really help you. and also, it may seem dirty to go to thirft stores, but you can find amazing stuff there for like a dollar.|`|nHCkucoxaa	i have a similar situation, i have my clothes so what i do is get some really cool accessories like jewellery, belts, hats and bags and stuff to take the main focus off the main clothes. also if you know how, you could edit some of the clothes. then when you start making money, shop around a bit, there are some really cool little boutiques around if you know where to look|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	go to a store like forever 21 they have a whole bunch of stuff that is easy to mix and match and it;s pretty cheap.|`|u6IY90Jbaa	shop at cheap stores that are super cute<br>  <br>  aeropostale<br>  <br>  and<br>  <br>  forever 21<br>  <br>  are both really cute and cheap|`|4eI15dylaa	If you shop in clearance, buy clothes that will look cute on you, clothes that you will want to wear, and try to mix and match, so you won't get board with it. Noone will know if you shop in clearance, unless you tell them, and read magazines like seventeen, and cosmo girl. That will give you ideas. hoped I helped!|`|CVze6WTkaa	Buy your basics first - white button-down, dark jeans, neutral colored shoes, etc. Some cheap stores are Aeropostale, Forever 21, Rainbow, Joyce Leslie, DOTS, Steve & Barry's - the list is endless. Buy clothes you can wear when you're older, too. Cardigans and blazers are perfect.|`|M3QjscQdaa	forever 21, ebay(it's good!), gap, and salvation army. salvation army is good if you like vintage, and indie stuff

nXPJ6d7eaa	Because photo's and webcam are not really YOU. YOU look pretty, but your two dimensional image may not because it lacks the substance you see when you look in the mirror. Your friends look at you and see the depth of your character, energy, life and all the other characteristics that make you who you are. Those don't translate too well on camera :)<br>  <br>  A wise woman once said 'It took me too long to realise that I don't take good pictures 'cos I have the kind of beauty that moves.'|`|Vk6s6VTAaa	Lol.. webcams are awful quality. No one looks good on them. The webcam ads you see are fake or they have a lot of lighting and I mean a lot of lighting. <br>  Video cameras and photo cameras that are poor quality exaggerate shadows and it makes people look worse than they really look. Don't worry. If you like what you see in the mirror, then that's good because it's what you really look like to other people.|`|AS2iH3N1aa	thats a good thing.<br>  would you prefer it the other way around?|`|8PRR3soraa	im the same. =/|`|qJxeMVf3aa	Im the same as well. I think i look decent in reality but when it comes to webcam and digital photos I look awful. Well at least i think so. Ive come to think that it has something to do with the lighting and positioning. The amount of pixels the camera has also makes a difference I have found. The more pixels the better. Just try to recreate the same lighting and positioning you have when you look in the mirror. If that doesnt work take your webcam back and say your just not happy with it :).|`|YPogLYscaa	I've been told I'm pretty all my life, but I photograph horribly, too. You know what's funny is that there are some models that photograph beautifully with all the makeup, lighting and enhancements, but when you get the makeup off or see them in person, they are not "all that". And like most women, you're probably incredibly critical of yourself and see flaws that others don't.|`|OHqJYU3Waa	That is a great question!!!  Unfortunately I don't have the answer, I only know that I have the same thing going on!!!  Every once in a while I will find a pic of myself that I think looks good.  Now maybe it's just us being critical about ourselves!  Maybe we do look good in photos and on web cams!  Maybe, let's wait for an Intelligent answer that makes us feel good!  :-))  I'm sure you look fab!!!|`|fSNlyxXpaa	It's because camera phone cameras and webcams SUCK!!!!  I'm not even kidding.  So many people have issues because of them.  Have a friend takes some photos of you with a nice camera, and you'll see what I'm talking about.|`|wUMkRtAkaa	almost everyone has that same problem.<br>  its just about not being so critical<br>  and getting a good picture every now and then.<br>  <br>  btw,<br>  i applaud your love for tokio hotel "]<br>  im a big fan of them.<br>  and their amazingness.|`|zqJl92NMaa	Wow! I've thought the same thing for years now! I'm actually quite relieved to find that I'm not the only girl to feel that she looks good in real life but looks horrible in pictures.|`|l7wbvrqWaa	u noe i have the same thing but like some ppl they are not photogenic and maybe in webcam it is not very clear and make you look bad but i think your very pretty.|`|9a3e79fe63eb3cd967ce9bfba3302b22aa	i think i look decent but when it comes to taking pictures ohh boy are they awful.  so i think a lot of girls have this problem. its just normal i guess|`|nkjGVOQ2aa	same :(<br>  thats why i take mirror pictures :D!!|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	It's all an illusion, it seems that you appear that way but you really don't. When you look into the mirror , you're looking at the opposite side of your body, hold your left hand up and it looks like you're holding up your right. Webcam is never accurate at times, slow movements, deformed body shape , but it's not you it's just the motion of the camera.
6PlfNPCmaa	I really like the one from Forever 21. [:<br>  But it also depends on how YOU actually look, so it depends?<br>  Personally, i like the first one.

bcd173d35993f0ffa9da4f1c985072e1aa	i do not think it is too much makeup for school.  it looks like you really know how to apply makeup ie right amount, right taste, etc.  you are not going overboard.  also, you have really nice skin which means you don't have to use a lot of foundation or anything, which keeps it looking very clean. but the real question is, do you feel comfortable?<br>  you look great, so don't be too hard on yourself!  good luck.  : )|`|iXhjGH4waa	no to be honest ive seen girls younger than me and you at my school and others and outside of school time who wear cake loads of make-up thinkin gthat they look pretty and that they are all that when they aint and look like tarts.|`|LPCfOtiKaa	no not at all, you look very pretty.|`|viQfxWEXaa	wow stop posting this weardrobe sht.|`|gVTK6NhBaa	No not at all!<br>  You look really pretty in that pic|`|fjkXS86Kaa	no|`|AtpMoCH4aa	no i think its ok.

The others don't seem to agree with me though.|`|B6dcHuk3aa	no i think yur lipstick is pretty;<br>  <br>  and yur hair is too;|`|JEsx5eugaa	perfect|`|UfPVZbRxaa	i would change the lip color may be go a little lighter? like pink neutral colors|`|AHHZ5Zwraa	LOL no|`|HyP41qbDaa	Does she even have any on???

47E10snbaa	Here's what you should do:<br>  First start off with your usual makeup routine minus the eye makeup.<br>  <br>  Apply primer all over your eyelids.<br>  Use a eyeshadow closest to your skin tone but a little lighter.<br>  Then do whatever other eyeshadow you would like.<br>  Apply WHITE eyeliner on the inside of your bottom lid.<br>  Now apply black or whatever eyeliner color you use on the outsides, never the insides, it will make your eyes appear smaller. <br>  Lastly curl and apply your mascara. (Here's a suggestion, use Dior Diorshow Iconic Mascara, $24 Sephora)|`|6uYVRaebaa	use light colors<br>  put a white line of eyeliner on your top lid|`|dwzfjlJraa	Making Small Eyes Look Larger <br>  To begin with, apply a light colored shadow on the entire eyelid. <br>  Apply light eye shadow on the inner corner and one shade darker, on the outer corner of your eyes. <br>  In order to blend the shadow, rub it outwards and up, using your index finger or a cotton swab. <br>  Make use of a curler to curl your eyelashes. To give a wider appearance, put false eyelashes on the outer corner of your eyes. <br>  Apply a liquid eye liner, matching the shade of the eye shadow, on the top lash line. Do not draw it in the inner area of your eyes. Start drawing it at the beginning of the growth of eyelash and work to the middle of the eye. Wing it out, to "open up" the eye. <br>  After the liner has dried, apply two coats of mascara. Again, focus it on the outer portions of the lashes. <br>  Your makeup is complete, giving your eyes a bigger look|`|tZ87odQ0aa	You could make your eyes bigger by wearing your make up a certain way..<br>  <br>  I make my eyes look smaller by wearing eyeliner RIGHT on the inner lids.. ahha.<br>  <br>  So just don't wear a lot of eyeliner, and don't wear it very, very close to your eye.

Times are tough now, and that is a difficult age also because there is so much pressure to dress like your peers. I have a couple of ideas:<br>  <br>  (1) My son is 16, and I remember when he was ages 13-15 his friends would come over and trade clothes with him. They were always grabbing stuff out of his closet!!! But do you have any friends about the same size? It helps if you can trade with a few people, basically doubling or tripling the size of your wardrobe!<br>  <br>  (2) Garage sales are a great way to get nice clothes at a very reasonable price. I just started going to garage sales, and I couldn't believe the amazing deals you can get. Get to the sale as early as possible, and don't be afraid to ask the seller if they will accept less than the price on the item.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Hope this helps!|`|QwpRD7DUaa	try getting a job, then you both can have more money.<br>  <br>  krogers hires 14 year olds.<br>  <br>  just call around & try and find jobs for 14 years old.<br>  if your turning 15 any time soon Dairy Queen is hires at 15,<br>  its were me and my friends are getting jobs in May :D<br>  <br>  also, try Platos Closet,<br>  they have really nice clothes & their not expensive,<br>  all their clothes are namebrand too. :D|`|ZPsLuAncaa	well once you get Your job it won't be that bad but you should just try places like tj max or even forever 21 they have cheap stuff|`|dat8eoYyaa	save save save...they even have cute things 4 summer @ places like target, old navy, ross, these places dont cost as much,

y2O1D8q7aa	Well, Im a girl. But I have heard that some guys thinks its hot when girls have belly button rings, I personally an a bit undecided.<br>  A pro is that they are really cute!<br>  but a major con is that its going to hurt really bad and might not even work unless you get it done by a professional(:<br>  <br>  But if you can stand the pain I say go for it(:|`|pgmXNpuOaa	I just got mine done monday and I love it....its so cute<br>  <br>  pros:<br>  sexy, cute, awesome, amazing lol<br>  <br>  cons:<br>  can get infected if not taken care of, but its easy to take care of it.<br>  <br>  just get it done its hot! <br>  <br>  I have heard from alot of guys they think its hot|`|sxP8G12zaa	although it might sound cool now, in 10 years, you'll likely be looking at it like "I really don't need this anymore."  It's something that you might enjoy while you're young, and yets it's just one more thing to worry about when you're getting yourself ready.|`|uaYDfH2Qaa	Like all of this piercing junk, they make a female look trashy, cheap and /or easy :{|`|c5anDswjaa	I like them, then again Ima fan of pretty much any piercings.. People are going to say they are trashy and stuff, but they arent.. A piercing cant be trashy, only a person can be.. I have a bellybutton ring, and Im not even close to being trashy.. Theyre just another adornment on your body like a ring or necklace would be..<br>  <br>  Pros- Theyre pretty cute, nice to look at, will make you happy because you got one, shopping for new jewelry<br>  <br>  Cons- Paying for it, possible infections, having to sacrifice swimming and baths for a while, soreness afterwards for a while|`|MSfsg9dBaa	I'm a girl and I have one and really like it. plus most guys think it's hot. <br>  <br>  pros:<br>  really cute, stylish, good way to show off a toned tummy, look good with bikinis<br>  <br>  cons: <br>  can get infected pretty easily, pretty sore for a few days afterwards<br>  <br>  but overall I'm glad I got it done. As long as you take really good care of it, it's fine. plus it really doesn't hurt as much as people say. it hurt more than my ear lobe and lip piercings but less than my nose and cartalidge if that means anything to you haha<br>  <br>  good luck!

Pamela Anderson, is she beautiful? to some people is, to some other is gross, why? the humongous boobs are away from her body balance, but some people like them humongous. Or Angelina Jolie, well most of the people like her, but some others think that her lips are to big!<br>  So we are not blind, is just the majority like more balanced features in a body or a face.<br>  |`|CoKIxt4Eaa	Err.<br>  <br>  How fake.

I have MANY customers come and ask me what to do with themselves. I can help. =]<br>  <br>  For your eyes, try a nice Purple/Plum shade of eyeshadow. Bring it up to the top of your eyelid. Beyong that, try to smudge in a lighter shade of purple up to the brow. ANd for mascara, use a little bit, not too much, in Soft Smoky Black. Use eyeliner in a soft black. Then smudge it with eggplant eyeshadow.<br>  <br>  For your blusher, try a light sheer pink.<br>  <br>  For lips, use a nice shimmery pink or sometimes even use a golden brown.<br>  <br>  DUst your arms and legs with shimmer powder.<br>  <br>  And your ready to go.<br>  <br>  <br>  Who ever said that Daddy's Little Girl doesn't know how to use makeup? =]<br>  <br>  |`|jwfW6ynEaa	eyeshadow: try light pink or a peach shimmery color eyeshadow<br>  <br>  mascara: i love covergirl lash blast mascara<br>  <br>  eyeliner: try grey or black eyeliner and apply under your lashes as close to them as possible<br>  <br>  blush: get something coral-colored or something light like that. make sure you rub it in.<br>  <br>  foundation: liquid foundation is best. i recommend covergirl clean makeup. put a small amount-about the size of a small button-on a cosmetic sponge and then apply it to your face.<br>  <br>  you should read GL magazine. it has tons of great makeup tips in it.|`|1s5PHN80aa	If you go to seventeen.com, they have lots of tips. If you're able, go out and get beauty magazines or search on line and practice. When i was younger, when  I was bored, i'd practice new colors and tricks to make my eyes really pop.

You sound very pretty and the more natural the look the better.Use lighter eyeshadows such as light peachy browns and golden colors maybe even pinks. Try brown and soft black eyeliners lightly line the top of the eye-lid and the bottom eyelid put on a couple light coats of mascara and make sure your face make-up isn't caked on or too heavy. |`|aegDO9Araa	Since you haven't had a lot of experience with makeup, stick with natural colors like browns, tans, and bronzes. Using brighter colors like purple and blue may end up looking clownish until become more experienced. <br>  If your eyes are your best feature, youre going to want to play them up. Curling your eyelashes before you apply mascara is a good way to open up your eyes to make them stand out. <br>  Since you will be playing up your eyes, you wont want to wear a dark lipstick, otherwise you will look overdone. Stick with a nude lipstick, close to your skin color (either a little lighter or a little darker so your lips still show), and apply a nude or clear gloss. You could even go as simple as just wearing some lip balm or vaseline. <br>  For the rest of your face, if you want to wear a foundation, make sure you find one that matches your skintone. To make your face seem more contoured, you will want to take a contouring powder or a matte bronzer and apply it starting at your temple and curve it down under your cheek bone. Apply a highlighting powder on your brown bone and then on the apple of your cheek. Then blend all of it together so it doesnt look extremely noticeable. While websites and magazines can give you basic tips, the best way to learn how to apply makeup is to practice. When youre bored, just go start messing around. You will learn what styles look the best on you. Good luck :)

You've probably also got some moisture loss since the hair you flat ironed for so long may have become more porous, and that can cause hair to lose moisture faster. I don't know what's in the Tresemme, but if it has a lot of silicones or polyquats in it, you might be experiencing some weird buildup on the ends.|`|B3AUJrtYaa	It is a good idea to get a trim every 6-8 weeks.  It will keep your ends healty and you will maintain a healthier better looking length.  You could get a deep conditioning treatment and use it about once a week.  That will help to keep the moisture in your hair.  If you are using a flat iron you should look for a product that will help protect your hair from the heat.  It will put a barrier between your hair and the heat to keep it from burning up the surface of your hair.|`|LaC6nwpKaa	ohmygodd!<br>  i had the same problem when i used that shampoo and conditioner:O<br>  i now use paul mitchel tea trea lavender mint shampoo and conditioner<br>  and my hair is so freakin soft ! :D|`|F5rOh5SZaa	the heat protection spray is very good basically the best thing you can do <br>  another product you should use is leave in conditioner after you shower so your hair stays soft and a once a week hair mask<br>  i recommend neutrogena triple recovery hair mask(or something like that) <br>  i use it and the most complimented thing about me is my hair

286158035f0bdbcd6406fc818ecc200faa	Before washing it in HOT water, I'd try WARM and dry on "WARM."  You can always shrink it more if necessary.  I would not, however, use HOT water.  Rayon often tends to shrink, and you don't want to have it shrink too much.  Better to wash and dry it several times using the WARM settings to get a more "custom" shrinkage.|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	not much take it to a seamstress get it made smaller |`|kQLKe2qTaa	It will shrink probably to a size small and a half |`|9wmne6lGaa	read the tag and see how it's supposed to be washed because if you don't and you just go ahead you might make it shrink the wrong way. If you can't make it shrink i would say just get a new one and give the ol one away.|`|dh8QUfywaa	It shouldn't shrink at all.  Just use cold water and low heat in the dryer so that you don't melt it.|`|TIGZp5yzaa	maybe a little bit|`|cwsaoLJhaa	i think it would shrink just a little bit. it's a very cute dress..good luck!

IaTmXoLdaa	EXTREMLY. I feel that my clothes and fashion play largely into who I am as a person. They allow me to express myself and my mood with out saying anything. My sense of style allows me to make a statement, and when I'm wearing an outfit that I feel extra confident in - it just boosts my self esteem. Fashion is a passion of mine, and I truely feel it is a complex art form - and for this reason I have a great respect for it. I believe that the way you look on the exterior largely impacts the way people view you on the interior. I think it's amazing that we can be able to put on clothing that expresses who we are as individuals. |`|968KfJjqaa	Very important. Decides my status.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	very important!! i like to look good & my style is portrayed through how i dress. i also went to college for fashion design and i am very interested in it. i used to live in NY so that plays a big part in my fashion sense as well. |`|c4737e29e9f50588794cc0b8ffc45145aa	You have to be a very superficial person NOT to judge by the looks. The clothes you wear and the general style are the best reflection of the kind of person you are. Clothes are very important because you subconsciously choose the look that reflects and completes your personality. And fashion helps by highlighting interesting trends that may (or may not) be completely you. |`|b3c054cf8a809cd78b23404a2feecb7daa	Extremely important. I wouldn't know what to do if I couldn't go out and buy nice clothes/accessories/make-up, etc. I love my fashion!! Its nice when people make an effort with themselves.|`|W3F7xeF5aa	Pretty important but it's not my life you know. I wanna look good but i don't want to look like i just fell off the runway|`|mFCvnvIRaa	Clothes are very important to me.  I am far to modest to walk around naked.  Also, it gets cold where I am and clothes help keep me warm.<br>  When I was younger I cared more about how I looked and fashion was somewhat important to me.  I didnt try to always have the latest look but I tried to not look like a total dork.  Now, I have very little money to spend on things like clothes, hair, etc.  Also, I dont care so much anymore if I look like a dork. I bathe and wear clean clothes.  I know some people probably judge me poorly but thats their problem.|`|xxmxNxULaa	I don't think fashion is a leading concern in my life. However, I think it is a tool of expression. Also, when you feel good about your appearance and are comfortable in your own skin, you can do amazing things. On the other hand, comfort makes me happy. Sometimes I feel better in baggy black sweats than I do in my skinny jeans. Other times, I'd rather look nice. So it is and it isn't, depending on the occasion. I hope this answered your question! |`|WL0GBWIuaa	very important! the cloth tell all about you it is a way to express your Style and a lot of people judge you by your cloth and you cloth give to people firs impression about you |`|UxRMoewWaa	fashion means a lot to me because I myself wants to be a fashion designer someday..and i always want to look presentable.|`|wkWRO8nmaa	It's important for me because my job requires us looking presentable all the time.

And yes, it's a US thing, the UKs consignment/thrift shops are better then many of them in the US to begin with, so your "wore out" likely isn't the same as it is here.  <br>  <br>  As to what I do with them, I repurpose them, steal the buttons or zippers off of them since I sew, use the cloth to copy patterns onto if it will fit, make aprons out of them, cut them up for quilts and donate the squares, offer them to a school (shirts) for painting smocks for the kids.<br>  <br>  Check to see if the charity shops recycle clothing that isn't good enough.  Goodwill sells them to re-sellers for Africa, and my local one actually recycles them, so even bad clothing gets use.|`|ObYj3lYeaa	You could take your clothes to Goodwill thats a different way of recycling. or you could take them to Platos closet and get money for them.|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	recyle them into dusters, draught excluders etc|`|NvhWgFtnaa	salvation army..some i just garbage|`|U02Ku6jpaa	take them to a charity shop

m7eTAJVwaa	Those are called dandruff as well.  For superficial treatment, try using an anti-dandruff shampoo, like selsun blue (be extra careful not to get into your eyes,) rinse it thoroughly.  While it's still wet, try rubbing it gently with a clean towel.  Afterwards, apply a gentle moisturizer using a cotton swab (don't use your finger to apply) .  If moisturizer isn't available, try using coconut oil or virgin oil.  Never try to dig them out with your finger to prevent exacerbation; and to avoid secondary infections like bacterial and fungal infections..It's like: the more you rub it; the more flakes grow.    <br>  <br>  If these suggestions don't work, try consulting it to a dermatologist.  The dermatogist will have a good eye view of the situation and furthermore, she/he will explain it to you what are the necessary treatment and precaution on dealing with it, and prescribing the right medication (Corticosteroid ointment maybe.)<br>  <br>  Know what, it's hard to make any diagnosis on any skin disorders, unless looking at it first.|`|dHLEADn0aa	try putting a little dandruff shampoo on them next time you shower, but keep those eyes closed or it will burn your eyes. hope this helps!|`|cJkcSEzRaa	well, maybe washing with baby shampoo will help, that's what the doctor told my mom. what i do is when i wash my hair with dandruff shampoo, i always scrub my eyebrows too. other times, when i exfoliate my face, i also exfoliate the area around my eyebrows, sometimes that helps too. hope this helps, i have the same problem, and hopefully other people answer your question too, maybe i can get some info myself =]
7ki9mfh6aa	PRO ACTIVE<br>  if you use regularly and correctly.<br>  <br>  it works.<br>  it takes like 2 weeks.<br>  <br>  but it works.|`|nq7QXxIfaa	try a face mask from walmart(there 2 dollers)<br>  and there usually by perfume,or soap.<br>  <br>  i have on that is pink,red and it makes your face feel heated and cleared all my zits in one day<br>  <br>  and try nertizmia (cant spell it im sorry)<br>  it cleared my zits to before in 1 night<br>  <br>  oh the mask is like the one makes your face pink and you wash it off<br>  it makes it really smooth and not red<br>  it is 5 min mask<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|hrlYm4fjaa	oxy pads <br>  works like a charm
6ndM8fNLaa	Try dark purples... those would work perfectly with your complexion and coloring.|`|7AndmAg4aa	because you have dark hair and dark eyes do a lighter verson of smokey eyes. like grey or something like that.|`|47E10snbaa	If you have different colored specks in your eyes (like reddish, brown etc.) try matching your eye makeup with the colors.  If not try a smokey green or blue.  If you do see a different color in your eyes and try using a color that looks well it will make your eyes pop.  I don't know if I'm making too much sense to you haha.  If I'm not, just use either blue or green.  Black would look pretty but it wouldn't go well with your total look.|`|eoVRS0Y8aa	i usually use grey color<br>  try this:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zupy7R4uR2g&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zupy7R4uR...</a>|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Try slate gray. Or maybe do smokey eyes with a fun color, like a darker pink mixed with hot pink?
3zzbCODsaa	Ah girl I feel your pain! I'd say that their probably done growing. However, if you have an increase in weight they possibly could grow. Also, of course if you decided to have kids along the way they'll grow.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	No one can say if they'll get bigger, but I can say, "damn! Thicka than a snicka,  huh."  Pictures, please.  j/k.|`|Br9Ze4EGaa	It's possible, but most of the time, once you're done with puberty, they're done growing. Plus, large boobs aren't all that great, guys tend to have their eyes set more on them than your face, not to mention, the back pain can be a total b&*^%.|`|ahXMYdxnaa	yes, that is very big for your size I was a 36C until I was about 19.  Then, i grew into a 36D. A year later, I went to a 38DD, then a 38DDD(aka F). I had gained weight, which was probably the cause of it. After losing about 5 pounds, I am back to a 36DD at the age of 22. So, yes, they can still grow! I am living proof!|`|2PfMa1XIaa	they might get bigger. my older sister had double D's and she turned to an E. big breasts are actually okay, guys really like boobs, not kidding. there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages to big breasts one of the advantages is guys pay more attention to you.|`|sxP8G12zaa	The only time if your life (past the age of 18) that your breasts will get any bigger is when you are pregnant.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	No, i dont think so.

There is no guarantee that tanning will clear up your skin, a lot of times it will help in the short run but will actually cause more problems since tanning thickens the skin making it more likely to clog and produce more pimples. You can either get a spray tan to try and hide them and/or use make up to cover the really bad spots (what I had to do for prom) or just accept it and don't buy a backless dress.|`|6DszSDt4aa	I know this is not what you want to hear, but there is absolutely no way to tan safely. If you get a tan, that means skin is damaged. <br>  To stay safe from skin cancer, you should never use a tanning bed, and use a high SPF when you go outside, especially in the summer (I use SPF 60 or 80 because I have such pale skin.)<br>  <br>  If you want a nice tan, there are self-tanners that work amazingly on the market today. Do some research on makeupalley.com or totalbeauty.com to look for reviews of products and you'll look beautiful and bronze in no-time!<br>  <br>  Also, try a bronzer to give your face that nice after-beach glow without the damage to your skin.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  -Kay

You can go swimming after a few weeks but you might pick up something from the water although if you cleaned it properly it might not be a problem. Infection could cause it to look "not as pretty" or "odd" so I'd just be on the safe side and wait until you come back then there will be a much smaller chance of anything going wrong with it =]|`|8ZB8ja4Maa	i wouldnt get it pierced just now cuz if ur going to be swimming it can get an infection from the water with chlorine and stuff like that u should just wait till u come back|`|vOB3iVdxaa	I think you have to wait like, 6 to 8 weeks before swimming or taking it out .

p7Zz8rKyaa	You want to get any kind of face wash with salicylic acid or lactic acid. That will help get rid of acne and acne marks or scar's. Try dermalogica's products, Yes they are pricey, but they work. Get their resurfacing cleanser or their multivitamin thermafoliant. Anything that exfoliates will get rid of the scar's or marks faster and will help keep bateria away.

rBjYrdRUaa	its a smart idea if it were to disappear once your married but do you really want that there after you are married and it is no longer forbidden (to your husband atleast) <br>  and if it is there and it is forbidden then wont no one see it except your husband whos not forbidden? and if anyone else ever got that far chances of them understanding latin.. not so much<br>  but if its more for you to know its there and to know the value of it then i think it actually sounds really nice and sexy but not too sexy obviously since the word is forbidden so its not like "come get me" ahah<br>  anyways i think a padlock with the hole as a heart since like it can be unlocked but only by your husband (who you hopefully love) which would be adorable and would take away from the fact that you have a padlock tattoos on yourself it would make it more nice (get it in black and white too and not a big chunky one but a little "delicate" or "graceful" one if that makes sense) and it would be even cuter if your husband got a heart shaped key tattooed small somewhere on his body once you get married but only you and him and maybe a few other will know its significance|`|AA11475575	<br>  it may look awesome now....<br>  <br>  but i also think that something that is going to be there all your life should be something a little more meaningfull to you, something that you dont regret in a couple of years.<br>  <br>  also i think that a tattoo like that doesnt show you as a serious person about yourself, so why should anyone respect you....get what i mean?<br>  <br>  would you take seriously a guy that has "dont touch" in is lower belly??? when everybody knows it means the exactly opposite??|`|GEVO2vTyaa	I have a pelvis tattoo--well its right to the right next to my hair line and i LOVE it--i like the latin idea--as far as the symbol goes--something that means a lot too you!|`|76C3mHHiaa	cool! get one, and then ou can do a pelvis thrust!

F5R3TJEQaa	As of right now Chanel doesnt even sell them because there are SOO-> many i mean SO many fake ones that look authentic.  I personally know how flooded the market is with the fake chanel earrings and many other women know as well.  Everytime I see a girl with chanel earrings I know they are fake even if they look real.  No one 99.9% buys them real.  Why spend $500+ when people will assume they are fake anyway?  I hope you get my point and dont make the rich richer.   Its no secret the black market is huge and flourishing. Thanks China.|`|7UsJhVvRaa	I think if anyone wants past season authentic things (especially Chanel earrings) they go to ebay.

QTyOmk1Naa	For formal/special occasion, I recommend the smokey eye. It looks good on most people. Here are some video tutorials:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWIk5c7jRuw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWIk5c7jR...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zupy7R4uR2g&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zupy7R4uR...</a><br>  Basically you blend eyeliner and eyeshadow to create a smokey, seductive look. It is great for proms, dates, or formal occasions. It is more sophisticated and often very dramatic. It works with dark, smoke colors. You can do a subdued looking smokey eye with a chocolatey brown eyeliner and eyeshadow.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the casual everyday work/school, I recommend natural looking makeup. The basics include a dark eyeliner. I would go for a dark brown because you have green eyes. I personally don't use mascara, but you can add any dark colored mascara to highlight your lighter colored eyes (because of the contrast). <br>  <br>  A bronzer is awesome for a natural looking glow. You can also add blush (pale/medium pink for you), but not too much or you'll look like a clown. I actually recommend and electro-green (almost neon-like) green based on your skin color and complexion, for eyeshadow. It will really make your eyes "pop" and matches your eye color. <br>  <br>  For everyday makeup, you'll often find yourself in a rush, so you'll need to learn to apply eyeliner properly and quickly at the same time. Here's a link I found: <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2034408_properly-apply-eyeliner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2034408_properly...</a><br>  <br>  Important Tips:<br>  **Wash your face before applying any makeup with a gentle face wash or bar soap (like Dove). Be sure to cleanse around your eyes with warm water. Pat your face dry and apply a hydrating moisturizer and lip balm.<br>  <br>  **When doing the smokey eye, I don't recommend pulling attention to your lips as well. Use a lip balm or neutral color, moisturizing lipstick. A tiny bit of lip gloss won't necessarily hurt.<br>  <br>  **Eyeshadows to look for include: Apricots, taupes, chocolatey browns, most neutral colors. Here's two links to help with green eyes: <br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Makeup-Tips-For-Green-Eyes&id=109931" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Makeup-Tips-Fo...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.articleclick.com/Article/Eyeshadow-For-Green-Eyes/924948" rel="nofollow">http://www.articleclick.com/Article/Eyes...</a><br>  <br>  **With green eyes, I recommend to stay far, far away from any sort of blue eye shadow. Light blues, dark blues, and colors with blue undertones often clash with green eyes. The only exception is turquoise because it's a mix of green and blue.<br>  <br>  **Play around with your hair as well. I think that big, flowy curls look great with smokey eye makeup, and just about any hairstyle works for every day makeup, even a messy bun on the top of your head.<br>  <br>  **For the natural look, don't go crazy with the eyeliner. You need just enough to almost "seal" your eyelash, Try a lighter brown eyeyliner for the bottom lid once in a while.<br>  <br>  <br>  **The internet is sometimes hard to find useful information. Try to get the majority of your information and tips on makeup from sites like this, as you can get answers based on experience.|`|q2mzJ48gaa	With green eyes I would use plum colored eye shadows.

Go through your normal cleansing and moisturizing routine before you put anything else on your face. Then get all your make-up together and go into a room with a mirror and some natural light, if that's not available, any bright-ish lighting is good. Plus any stray eyebrow hairs, just don't overdo it today. <br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  <br>  Apply a smaller-than-usual amount of your foundation in small dots on your face, and use your fingers or a sponge to blend from the center out. Make sure it blends up into your hairline and down your neck as well. Nothing kills a look faster than a bi-color jawline. Apply a liquid or cream concealer to any blemishes or discolored spots on your face. <br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  <br>  Brighten your eyes by apply concealer underneath, and onto the lids to act as a primer for your eyeshadow. Apply a neutral colored shadow all over your lid, a light beige is great. Take a darker neutral and carefully blend it into the countour of your eyelid, and then a very light or white shade on the inner corners of your eye to appear more awake<br>   <br>  Step 4<br>  <br>  No liner is necessary for this look, but if you feel you must, make it a thin line and blend it a bit. Go light with your mascara, wiggle the wand back and forth across your lashes. I've found it helps to gently wipe the wand with a tissue prior to applying. Take a translucent powder and gently swipe it everywhere but your eyes, concentrating on your T-zone. <br>  <br>  Step 5<br>  <br>   Save your blush until the very last, so if you went a little heavy on your eyes, you can balance it back out by using less blush, and vice versa. If you have very light lips, apply some nude lipstick, if you have pink-colored lips naturally just wear some clear gloss or chapstick. Now take a good look in the mirror and make sure your look is even and natural-looking. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  or....................................... (this is from me)<br>  <br>  Keep it casual but not sloppy or slutty. Wear a long skirt that does not show a lot or nice pants, they don't have to be dress pants but it couldn't hurt. A nice blouse in a not too bright color or a nice looking t-shirt is also acceptable. Don't have loud jewellry in bright colors, just keep it toned down and quiet. For shoes, just avoid running shoes if you can and tall stilettoes, but some casual flats or small heels would be perfect. One pair of earrings, not anything big and flashy. No nose rings or any piercings that's not in your ears actually! No words on your t-shirt or ripped jeans (or any jeans, unless they're reaaaally nice, dark, fancy ones), and don't go crazy with make-up or your hair. Also no  mini-skirts, or tank-tops; all things to be avoided. It's basically the same thing as for a professional interview, just a little toned down. Go with your best judgement though, and try to keep it as simple and casual as possible.|`|kYPiU1BJaa	DO NOT overdo it!

I lather that on my lips at night to really help them heal without having to worry about it coming off during the day.  To exfoliate your lips, put some vaseline on them, wait about 10 minutes, and lightly scrub with a toothbrush.  works great for me!|`|1yJIifDXaa	Well, that's good that you like it so much, but I think your lips are addicted.

You might look at whether or not you are drinking enough water too.|`|E6jjhNHwaa	First try to not lick your lips. Lots of people (including me) think that it will, help, but all it does is it drys your lips even more.

dHLEADn0aa	It looks like eyeliner wouldn't really work for that. But I would suggest using an angle eye brush and shadow to create that soft, smokey look. I never use eyeliner, only dark shadow with an angle brush. It's much softer, easier to apply and no one can tell it's not liner!|`|7AndmAg4aa	you'll probably have to use liquid liner and have a steady hand. sometimes liquid takes a bit of getting used to. good luck.|`|4A8lGwYJaa	SIGN IN?|`|as6Kid5Iaa	Lols; ohkay; from what i see; i think yuh should put a primer or run some kind of foundation or concealer so that it wont make the eyeliner smudge as much, then use a white eyeliner and try go around yurh eyes with it ; maybe yuh should go over the eyeliner once or twice then smudge it a little bit so it doesn't look that harsh; after that; use the eyeliner ; use a pencil eyeliner for the waterline & use pencil/cream/liquid eyeliner along the lashes so that yuh dont get any infections ; also; use mascara and for the eyeliner; dont worry about mistakes because as yuh see, she put an thick line for the eyelinerrr;|`|bozG3qcFaa	All you need is a black eyeliner.<br>  You can use any black eyeliner a really good cheap drug store brand would be N.Y.C...it's about a dollar or 2 and works great. This is a pencil liner.<br>  <br>  A great retractable liner would be the Maybelline Unstoppable.<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=10450504" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a><br>  <br>  This is a great retractable liner because it doesn't look gray when you put in on your eyes and it literally stays on all day, like i even cried once and it was still on. haha thats how good it is. And the reason i'm telling you it doesn't turn gray is because some retractable liners are not pigmented enough so if they are black (supposedly) they look gray. <br>  <br>  So to get the look all you have to do is apply the liner on your water line and on your top.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1hc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...</a><br>  <br>  This video is perfect for you to learn how to do this, now the gurl in the video doesn't put the eyeliner on the bottom as heavily as i do, i think b/c her eyes water but all you have to do is keep applying it and kind of thicken the line more by going a little below the water line into your lashes. And for the top its not necessary to have a liquid eyeliner, i happen to have the one that she uses the Revolon ColorStay, its ok to use but i'm not good at using liquid lineers and i have very thick top lashes so i don't use eyeliner on the top anyways. <br>  <br>  I think the gurl in the picture you attached has fake top lashes on, which you don't need. Just use a mascara a good one would be CoverGirl Last Blast or any mascara it doesn't need to be anything special...apply it to your top lashes and some on your bottom.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps<br>  <br>  =]<br>  Jasmine|`|l0dMHigQaa	just keep putting alot of eyeliner on and put dark eye shadow to make ur eyes look bigger  and more volumous.<br>  <br>  they also make them look even prettier.|`|y2O1D8q7aa	You have to sign in for that(:|`|MvyFLRBiaa	Its more than eyeliner. Eyeshadow, eyeliner, mascara and probably fake lashes were used as well. It's called a "smokey eye" look.

Least recommended is snipping them off as they tend to grow right back and pose an infection risk.<br>  <br>  You can try Dermasil, an herbal extract product.<br>  fingernail polish applied twice a day for about 2 weeks<br>  OTC wart removal kits <br>  Duct tape - put a piece just big enough to cover it and replace when the tape falls off until the tag falls off<br>  Vitamin E - Pierce a capsule and apply to the tag and cover with a bandaid wait a couple days<br>  <br>  Also there is an herbal remedy called 'blood-root' that can be applied.  This is also known as Indian paint and the blood colored sap was used by Indians to make war paint.  We have tons of it in our yard.<br>  <br>  Another method is to use Milk weed.  Tear off a small piece of a leaf and the white sticky sap will come out.

Make sure they're good, possibly get a recommendation from a friend - they may be expensive, but it's worth it. Tell them what you want - whether you want to keep it long but make it more "manly", or you don't mind if they cut it short to fix it. They should be able to fix your hairstyle to your satisfaction.

7a5ba58a6b673432d643a365648edc24aa	Website: www.viviennewestwood.com <br>  <br>   The most eccentric and influential of Britain's fashion designers who puts out on the runway the most amazing and spectacular clothes. Her Logo is a royal ORB with a cross on top, bejewelled and impressive as befits the Queen of British fashion. <br>  <br>  In 1941, Vivienne Swire was born in Derbyshire, England. Her father was a shoemaker and her mother a cotton weaver. When she was 16, her family moved to London and Vivienne attended the Harrow School of Art. After spending just one term there, she left to become a primary school teacher. She met her first husband Derek Westwood in 1962 and married him. They had a son Ben. In 1965, she met Malcolm McLaren who became her partner in fashion as well as life. He was a very flamboyant man. <br>  <br>  In 1971. together with McLaren, she started up a shop called "Let it Rock" on London's trendy Kings Road. She spent all night stitching rock-inspired clothes, visiting punk clubs and grunge bars. In 1974 the couple opened another boutique called "Sex" selling pornographically printed T-shirts and garments with sexual slogans printed on them. <br>  <br>  In 1977 they changed the name of their boutique to "Seditionaries" and sold garments with a bondage look made of leather. <br>  <br>  In 1980 there was another change of name to "World's End" and Vivienne introduced her Pirate collection, including frilly shirts and romantic swashbuckling styles. It was very successful. <br>  <br>  1982 She introduced the first collection in her own name which proved very popular. Her collections were called Buffalo, Savage, and Punkature. <br>  <br>  1983 She gave a fashion show in Paris, the first British designer to do so since Mary Quant in the 60's. People remember it as one of the best shows ever, but chic Parisiennes were horrified by the riotous behaviour and punky London garments. The collection was called "Punkature". <br>  <br>  Her relationship with McLaren ended and her shops closed but her talent could not be kept down. She opened a studio in London's Camden area, a 19 km bicycle ride from her modest apartment in South London. <br>  <br>  1984 Her collection was called Hypnos, the first sports collection with fluorescent fabrics on the catwalk. <br>  <br>  1985 Vivienne Westwood based her collection on Clint Eastwood, the film star. <br>  <br>  1985 She launched her "mini-crini" a very short crinoline design, which took off like a rocket. <br>  <br>  1987 The Harris tweed collection, thoroughly British tweed, twinsets and pearls (for the men too) <br>  <br>  1988 The Pagan collection, full frocks and Greek drapery. <br>  <br>  1989 Voyage to Cythera, with fig-leaf tights. <br>  <br>  1990 Her "Portraits" collection, used paintings of the old masters such as Boucher. You can see these by clicking on Art and Fashion <br>  <br>  1990 Vivienne Westwoo won her first British Designer of the Year award. <br>  <br>  1991 Cut and Slash, a collection featuring wittily torn cotton and slashed denim clothes. <br>  <br>  1991 Won her second Designer of the year Award. <br>  <br>  1992 She presented a collection based on Hollywood glamour called "You are always on Camera" <br>  <br>   Another collection the same year, parodied French couture. <br>  <br>  1992 She was awarded an O.B.E. and went to receive it from the Queen in a see-through blouse, and a skirt which when swirled around displayed her lack of underwear. She shocked the world. <br>  <br>  1993 She called her collection "Anglomania" and used tartan suits, ball gowns, fake fur corsets, etc. <br>  <br>  1994 Ravishing romanticism with "on liberty" <br>  <br>  1995 Erotic zones collection Assorted pads, hoops and stays pumped up the models contours and allowed them to alter their outlines at whim. Their erotically upholstered frames and playfully leering attitude is vintage Westwood. <br>  <br>  1996 Her collection was inspired by Watteau, the painter of exquisite 18th century women. <br>  <br>  The Cosmopolitan Fashion awards rank her 4th in the British ready-to-wear designers rank. <br>  <br>  1998 She has gone back to her Pirate beginnings, her new collection is called "tied to the mast" and features seamen. <br>  <br>  2000 Vivienne Westwood has become the "old lady of fashion" not yet completely respectable, but yet respected. <br>  <br>  Vivienne's Spring 2002 collection "Fairy Tales" showed pale woodland nymphs in natural muted tones, flowers and brambles with skirts bunched, ruched and drapes. Heavy cottons and suede skirts were worn with cherry leather aprons and sexy nymphs wore handcrafted crochet dresses in black and white, floating at the knee.|`|c76842a4b5075e9b6f08a7c1cc0ecaecaa	Umm the post above is too long. So I'll shorten it up.<br>  Vivianne Westwood is a punk rock designer. And she recently did a collabo with nine west to make supposedly "more affordable" accesories which almost all cost more than $100.

Try its fun lol|`|MjKOBQQqaa	Getting rid of blackheads is a difficult task. And there are many methods out there that simply don't work.<br>  <br>  For example...<br>  <br>  ......squeezing, steaming and popping.<br>  <br>  But here's a method that do work. It's called exfoliation.<br>  <br>  Exfoliation is the removal of the top layer of skin (the epidermis). And is effective for almost every type of facial skin care problem.<br>  <br>  But here's how exfoliation can get rid of blackheads......<br>  <br>  Blackheads form when sebum (natural oils produced by the skin) gets trapped in the skin's pores. And if these pores are partly open, then oxygen reacts with the trapped sebum, turning it black in color.<br>  <br>  Now to remove these blackheads requires you to "un-roof" the heads of the clogged pores.<br>  <br>  And guess what......<br>  <br>  ......that's exactly what exfoliation does when removing the epidermis of the skin.<br>  <br>  And once the head of the pore is removed, the trapped sebum can be taken out via cleansers and toners.<br>  <br>  So how do you exfoliate?<br>  <br>  Well you can visit a doctor's office to have a chemical peel, laser peel or a microdermabrasion procedure.<br>  <br>  But I must warn you that these procedures are expensive. In fact a chemical peel procedure can cost up to $300.<br>  <br>  But there's a cheaper way if you're interested.<br>  <br>  You can purchase the at-home versions of the chemical peels and/or microdermabrasion creams. These work well although you'll take a little longer to get the results your looking for.<br>  <br>  However, once you've removed the top layer of skin (the epidermis), you'll easily get that trapped sebum out of your pores.|`|nQIVg9kVaa	DONT squeeze it. anything but that. you'll get scars<br>  there are special products out there for blackheads.|`|bjuSB8k6aa	their are blackhead facial scrubs u could try....|`|t607jqu5aa	you have what?

HsL0PYNGaa	well it's hard to see becuase its all black, but from what I see they seem to look good!<br>  just watch out what colors your wear. don't go for too light colors if your really worried.|`|TdGbIDH8aa	No if you think they make your legs look big go for a darker color like purple. But I don't think your fat at all :)|`|8rt7OR35aa	nope.<br>  i have this friend that has super huge thighs and she still wears colored skinnies.<br>  and i think she looks good in them.<br>  so no, you can most deff wear skinnies.<br>  they're hott!<br>  ;)|`|8Jl7ql9Saa	You're not too fat at all but I honestly think that even the thinnest people don't look too great in coloured skinny jeans.  They're hideously unflattering!!  Having said that, if you get ones which don't cling to your ankles too much but are a little wider at the bottom (I don't mean bootcut, I mean slightly more straight-leg than skinny), then they could still look good.<br>  <br>  Of course you may decide to wear them anyway, and if this is the case, it's entirely up to you - if you like them, wear them!  But if you do, since your legs aren't straight up-and-down and you have thighs (this is a good thing! You look like a woman, not a pre-pubescent boy!), you could always wear skinny jeans with a tunic or a longer top which skims over the top of them and comes to crotch level.  The volume will balance you out and make the most of your shape.|`|vuRYpPj2aa	You're not too fat, but you have to think about if it would be flattering to your shape. I can't really tell from the picture, but it looks like you're bigger on top & have skinnier legs, but you have hips (not a bad thing). I don't think wearing a bright color on your hips would look good, especially if it's a big contrast to the color in your top. You have the right idea in the pictures, black is slimming and the same color on top & bottom doesn't acentuate anything. I reccomend leaving the bright colors to accessories (shoes, jewelry, bags, etc.) to look good and make the outfit pop.|`|AcsML4Leaa	your not fat what so ever! :S|`|7172f76ec68527ba123843d80455117aaa	oh my..i have the exact same body shape as you and i adore colored skinnies! because you have hips wear them with heels - peep toe or pumps, this makes a whole lot of difference trust me.your  legs will look slimmer and longer. and wear a top that reaches midway of your hips it will cut the roundness into half. if u wear a top this length, your can even pull off flats with ur skinnies.dont wear anything longer it wont show off your shape. try this....i promise you will look awesome!|`|be99e47305df0d68fe5dbd12d160b8fdaa	yeah.. id probably avoid colors especially and jeans.

mT5srUKHaa	1 Wash and condition your hair using a curling shampoo and conditioner combination. Curling shampoos work by stripping the hair of oil and dirt that inhibit curling ability and by providing added volume and bounce to ordinarily limp and lifeless hair. Simply wet your hair, apply the shampoo, work it into a rich lather and allow it to remain on your hair for four or five minutes before rinsing. <br>  <br>  Step2 Towel-dry your hair to remove excess water and comb it using a wide-tooth comb. <br>  <br>  Step3 Apply a light scrunching gel or mousse from the roots to the ends of your hair. While a light mousse will work well for fine hair, you may achieve better results if you use a hair gel or glaze if your hair is naturally thick or heavy. You may have to experiment with different product lines to find the ones that work best for your hair type. <br>  <br>  Step4 Dry your hair for 2 or 3 minutes with a hairdryer equipped with a diffuser. Set your hairdryer to its coolest setting to avoid frizz when you scrunch your hair. <br>  <br>  Step5 Apply gel or mousse to your palms and rub them together to coat your hands and allow even distribution when you scrunch your hair. <br>  <br>  Step6 Start at the bottom of your hair and carefully wad it in small sections (as if you were wadding a piece of paper in your hands) as you work your way to the scalp. Flip your hair over and repeat. <br>  <br>  Step7 Repeat Steps 4, 5 and 6 until your hair is completely dry. <br>  <br>  Step8 Spray the curls lightly with hairspray to make them last all day.|`|MXpW48lFaa	Well to keep the scrunch effect in your going to need mousse and<br>  hairspray. One or the other should be find too.<br>  <br>  First make sure your hair is damp. Not soaking wet or dry but DAMP.<br>  Next run a bit of mousse through your hair, using the tips of your fingertip.<br>  Once you've done that, grab chunks of your hair and just mess it up.<br>  Grab it and then scrunch it. Flip your head upside down and spray a bit<br>  of hairspray in. Keep on scrunching. Flip your head back the right way <br>  and apply more mousse, again using  your fingertips. Once done apply<br>  some more hairspray and let your hair air dry. It gives you a better <br>  effect. If you want wavy-ish hair. If your running short on time, just<br>  blow dry it. I'd suggest before you start applying mousse and <br>  scrunching that you should put in some kind of serum like leave in <br>  conditioner or anti-frizz serum. It will keep your hair looking shiny and<br>  keep it health. Not to mention soft and silky.

It will make your hair thinner :)<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped :)<br>  <br>  [EDIT]<br>  <br>  If your not sure on what getting your hair razored means, then I'll explain. All the hairdresser does is get a comb with a razor on it and basically streak/brush it down your hair. It makes your thick hair, thinner by layering it out. Or else the hairdresser will use a pair of special scissors to do the exact same. Streak/brush it down your hair. Don't worry, they're professionals. They know what they're doing.

You really should use a proper serum (it gives protection during styling, hair manageability, makes it, smooth silky and shiny), i'd also recommend a proper daily regime, shampoo, conditioner and a hair mask (deep conditioning treatment) is a must for dry, chemically damaged or frizzy hair. Please feel free to visit my web-store at <a href="https://www.infashionsense.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.infashionsense.com</a> for more info on HerStyler natural plants-protein and olive oil products - they really give your hair fantastic results! I'd also consider what styling tools i'm using, conventional hair dryers and irons are damaging, again take some time to read more on my site about 'herstyler', they are natural mineral styling tools that won't dry, damage or frizz your hair so you can continue chemically treating your hair and still have great hair!

cc63926e476c6d83d78ef0ed7a0fd541aa	i just used pink lotion and some S-curl wave control pomade, i had waves in only 2.5 weeks. after that its easy just put the stuff in after u ge out the shower and brush for a good 30 mins or so. and put on a du rag, stockin cap or wave cap. and theyll come. but a word of advise dont get waves unless u really want them cause they are permanent, unless u grow ur hair out and they still will kinda be there|`|f17a3a4cbbf1eb96acd790e02f25d0ddaa	wash your hair with a residue free shampoo (one with no smell or color) and while it's towel dry apply a generous amount of wave grease. don't worry about too much you can comb it out later but you need alot. Brush the hair with a good wave brush (at least $4-5) and durag it up. Then use a blow dryer on low till you hair dry. then comb out the excess grease. After one or two of these your waves will be bangin

Generally, with such things there is a temporary euphoria with it because it feels like a big change and everyone notices it and has something to say about it.  After awhile people stop saying much about it as they get used to it and it becomes no big deal.   The euphoria wears off.<br>  <br>  Then, you'll start to want the same rush again and consider getting another piercing.  Only, because this is your 2nd instead of the first, people will not respond as much and your euphoria will be of a shorter duration and less intense.    <br>  <br>  This can lead you with a piercing addiction, but I'm not saying that this WILL happen to you.  There are all kinds of ways to mutilate or disfigure yourself in order to get a buzz/attention or whatever it is you are looking for.    Piercing, implants, tattoos, chains, and even various minor amputations.  Some people have even had their eyes tattooed!  I think they're all gross.  It was all I could do to stay out of it when my daughter had her ears pierced.   I know that pierced ears are a traditional 'acceptable' piercing and I can get used to it, but hey, it's your body so do what you like.<br>  <br>  When my oldest kids were in college they got tattoos.  I told them that tattoos were a sign that they were getting too much financial aid.<br>  Really, you don't need anyone's advice on YA to decide which side to have this piercing.  My guess is that you are seeking attention and this is an easy way to get it.  <br>  <br>  Check out my sources for some interesting photos of people who just couldn't seem to say no to piercings.   Seems pretty extreme to me, but I have never understood the whole piercing phenomenon.<br>  <br>  Best of luck in your decisions.|`|2404nDvSaa	You shouldn't get it, it won't look great on you...

qFvHH6lUaa	You should probably start with a foundation primer if what you're wearing wears off.  Or go for on of the long lasting foundations.  I haven't tried it yet, but when I run out of what I'm using, I want to try Rimmel StayMatte because I have oily skin too.  To stay natural looking, use the base and mascara, but you could also try a sheer lip gloss or one with a touch of pink.  A thin line of black eyeliner on your top lid.  A tiny bit of a light blush or bronzer would be good.  Any combination of these would add a subtle touch.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	If your skin is getting oily through the day, that's probably what's causing your foundation to come off. Try using the TruBlend Pressed Mineral Foundation instead. It's a powder that offers as much coverage as a liquid foundation, but it will help counter-act and absorb the oil in your skin. For waterproof mascara, Maybelline makes a bunch. I personally love Full N Soft, Lash Discovery, and Volume Express, which all have a regular and waterproof version.|`|o01QtRwWaa	First, make sure that you get an oil-free moisturizer if you have really oily skin. You may also want to use an oil-free foundation primer if your makeup wear off. Next, you should try mineral or powder foundation. It holds up longer, and doesn't wear off as easily. But if you like your liquid foundation, make sure that you set it with powder after you apply it.|`|5ci9IZd2aa	I stopped using cream foundation a long time ago because I wanted a more natural look, and a less heavy feeling on my face so I use Loreal <br>  Bare naturals it's a mineral makeup, I also love Mary Kays mineral foundation too.

e9vcMWgnaa	either lash blast or stilletos! lash blast goes for more full look, where as stilletos goes for the longer look.<br>  so if you put them together, you get the full affect :) <br>  <br>  if you dont want to spend alot of mascara, you could always go thru avon and get 'super shock' mascara. it works just as good as lash blast! <br>  <br>  also you can try an eyelash curler after applying mascara. it really gives them more definition!!|`|qB0hgrixaa	CoverGirl Lash Blast...|`|YXAlcNVJaa	Depends really, <br>  what's your budget?<br>  I would say if your willing to go all out and pay around ￡20, Yves Saint Laurent waterproofs are really good for thickening out your eye lashes and making them darker and fuller :)<br>  but if you only want to spend say ￡5, magi-lash (the orange one) is really good because the brush is thin and doesn't cause your eye lashes to clot up :)<br>  I loveee make-up!<br>  the best way to find make-up (mascara in your case) to fit you personally would be to visit shops such as Dingles:<br>  www.dingles.com<br>  or beales:<br>  www.beales.co.uk<br>  Where you can get a make-over appointment- at least that way you know which is the best to buy and what we make you look better :)<br>  hope you find the one you want!<br>  x|`|KwzovnIRaa	Definitely Maybelline XXL EXTENSIONS.<br>  <br>  It has two steps.  The first step is a white gel that you put on your lashes for length and definition, while the second step is the mascara itself.  The trick is to do one eye at a time, because when the white gel dries, it makes your eyelashes clump together.<br>  <br>  I use this every day, it's WONDERFUL!|`|5ci9IZd2aa	Lash Blast by Cover Girl is by far the best mascara I have ever used, and I have tried many, It has a nice fat brush that covers and it makes my lashes look really long. Also if you want an even more dramatic look take your eyelash curler and heat it up a bit with your blow-dryer. Yes! it gets a little warm, I haven't ever burned myself. Hope this helps.

TAgAnfIbaa	when you apply eyeliner get close to your upper lash line and glide across. If you make a mistake you can take a Qtip with a little eye makeup remover and clean it up. For a smokey eye apply on top and bottem of the lash line and smudge it out with a brush,Qtip, or your finger. One to try is bobbi brown gel liner and ultra fine liner brush she has a lot of cool colors to choose from and it lasts all day or all night.|`|pZBq0TKcaa	If it looks good, then it doesn't really matter how you do it.<br>  Everybody does it slightly differently anyway.|`|QesrwtJfaa	I just put it on my water line and then sometimes I only put it on the top lid right in my lashes.

wUIJSSJlaa	That will be a really tender spot.  The first one I got was on the back of my calf and on the pain scale it was probably only a 5 out of ten.  That is one of the least painful places to get a tattoo.<br>  <br>  Yes, a tattoo will hurt but it's all worth it in the end and you will want to go back and get another one.  Just think, millions and millions of people have them so the pain is bearable.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Well it really depends where you get it from if you go to a nicer place sometimes it hurts less :)|`|HUrYSp4oaa	yes they will hurt and probably it will get better if u have future ones done as u will get used to it.  there are probably some places more or less painful ask the tattooist if u dont find out on here. my son is terrified of needles but he got several tattoos done now.  first time he felt faint and they had to keep stopping but advised him to drink sugary drink eg coke and he felt better. also good idea to take yr usual painkiller ibuprofen or paracetamol an hour before u go that can help. good luck.|`|ll5lS1wmaa	Where you get it depends on how much it hurts, and it also depends on your personal level of pain tolerance. Fleshier areas like the arm won't hurt as much whereas a place right on top of the bone will hurt a lot more (for example, the ribs is the worst.) I have a tattoo by my hipbone and it barely hurt at all.|`|fbguVOiQaa	Yes they do hurt but it depends how high your pain thresh hold is to Weaver you can handle it. It its low, then i would go for a simple tattoo without alot of shading. I have a very detailed tattoo for my 1st one, didn't think it would hurt so much but it did, especially when he shaded it. This one was in the small of my back, My 2nd was on the bottom of my spine, less detailed and didn't hut as much. The 3rd was a really simple colour on on my stomach and this for me was agony!!<br>  My partner has them on his arms and didn't even flinch while having them!|`|oOQUba3paa	I'm 18 and have three.

Hope i've been of some help to you.|`|5BIJYTW3aa	Meh, some people will say it hurts, some will say it doesn't really hurt at all. I didn't think it hurt that much personally. It also depends on how big a tattoo you get. Maybe get a small one for your first.<br>  <br>  Kudos for not getting one on your lower back, it looks so trashy now. Which is a pity for anyone who got it while it was still cool and unique.<br>  <br>  Be warned that if you get it on your arm it might be hard to cover up.

Bring some distraction, like a friend or something, to take your mind off of it if you are that worried about it.<br>  <br>  And as far as location, that's your preference.

7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	I think you are speaking of a relaxer, not a perm. Anyway, when you take braids out of your hair, it's very weak and dry. So you shouldn't do any chemical treatments for about a month. Use that time to get your in better shape. I would do an Aphogee protein treatment a week or so before using chemicals on your hair. Use a deep conditioner during this time, and also use a leave-in conditioner after you wash/condition your hair. Once you put the chemicals in your hair, you shouldn't wear braids/weaves because it will cause breakage/hair loss.|`|JcuVOcyjaa	Is your hair damaged? How thick is it? I always relax my hair the same day i take my micros out, but i have thick hair. If you absolutely must have a relaxer after your braids then i would suggest you use a relaxer for sensitive scalps like Soft and Beautiful sensitive scalp formula (regular or mild, I always use regular and it never burns at all like other perms) or even a children's relaxer like Just for Me. I wouldn't suggest anything stronger and make sure you deep condition with a good cholesterol conditioner and/or hot oil treatment. Good luck!

a251tw6caa	I used to work in a store that sold suits.  Each brand is going to different.  Some brands are cut slimmer than others.<br>  I'm not sure how Calvin Klein is cut, but if you're a 40 long I would suggest trying a different brand.  Otherwise if you like Calvin Klein, a tailor will be able to let the sleeves out.  There's usually about 2 inches of fabric on the inside of a suit jacket in the cuffs that's available to work with.|`|uZxAWgaoaa	In theory, a size designation is the same between brands.  That's the theory.  That's now how things work however.<br>  Right now you will find that most clothing is made off-shore (China, mostly) and for some reason accurate measurement is not taught to Chinese factory employees.  So sizes differ between brands.  In fact, sizes differ between production runs.  I have tried trousers with the same label and size that have been more than an inch different in  both waist and leg length.<br>  Quality control just isn't there any more.  Enjoy your search for clothes that fit and make sure you try on everything before you take it home.|`|iIiRVexbaa	They should be similar, but you will always find differences like that between brands/designers.|`|GO43F0mwaa	Not sure I think they differ, you should always try stuff on before buying it and you should go to a tailor and get your measurements|`|0cr9lCzhaa	Most sizes are standard, But with European  designers, some have smaller sizes or athletic cut as well.

CtvesQyEaa	Ask your hairdresser on tips how to straighten your bangs when blow drying. Since she did it perfectly, she could teach you a few tricks on how to do it yourself.

Perhaps stick with the stars but look in tattoo magazines or online, choose a few designs and then speak to your artist and see if they can be made into one new and unique piece.|`|jd1xh6Lhaa	the black and white version of that has been taken up the norcal hardcore and skate scene, so i see my fair share of these tattoos everyone. not gonna lie i wouldnt hate getting one but it means nothing to me so i dont|`|oOQUba3paa	hmm i think they may have lost their style.

WvqRJow1aa	Did you just get it done ? The flaking is normal as it's the skin healing. Once that's done, you don't need any extra care since it's done deep and not at the layer that grows and flakes off.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	How long ago did you get the tattoo? Eventually it should stop flaking and just be like the rest of your skin. This takes longer with some than others. Some are almost back to normal after a week, some take as long as six weeks. The average is about 2-3 weeks before you're totally back to normal. It is always a good idea to keep the tattoo moisturised over your lifetime, but it shouldn't be drying out and flaking if you don't, after a few weeks. If it's been quite a long time, are you prone to eczema or dry skin in general? I know tattoos can occasionally flare up any existing skin problems if your skin is easily irritable, which could be the explanation if this has been going on quite a while.|`|TDtSZLmvaa	uhm well I got mine march 19th 2008 and june 29, 2007 and mine look like I just got them. if you got it in january give it some time to heal. and if it stays all cracked then obviously you did something wrong in the healing process. if you have any problems or questions like this IF it were me I would go to the artist not to yahoo answers.

3002db88900f693bcce9db919b556826aa	You should get the Remington Wet 2 Dry flat iron.  It comes in a wide plate width and a slimmer plate width.  There's also a curved slim plate one.  I actually have all three, but  I would suggest you get the slim plate version, this way you can get your edges and the nape of your neck better.  The curved plated one was a good idea but a waste.  Anyway you'll be able to dry, flat iron/straighten all in one shot.  Use a shampoo like Creme of Nature which softens the hair, a good after shampoo conditioner like Motions with silcone. Lastly a leave in conditioner, I suggest Lustrasilk 30 min manager.  Then section your hair in four.  Put a small amount of any frizz serum or polisher (like  Smooth N' Shine hair polisher, John Frieda's Frizz Ease or Hask Pure Shine) in the palm of your hand, rub your hands together then apply to one of the four sections and pin that section up.  Countinue with each of the other 3 section in the same way.  Then starting with the back sections take a small piece of hair use the Remington and flat iron /dry each piece until your done with that section.  If you dont get the Remington or another type of Wet/Dry flat iron then just blow dry small pieces of hair in each section and then go over the sections with a regular flat iron.   I am a Black American with relaxed long thick hair to the middle of my back.  My daughter has unrelaxed shoulder grazing length thick coarse hair and i use this method for both of our hair.   I have let her kiddie relaxer grow completely out of her hair over the last 9 months ago, so her hair is back in it's natural state.

The chi does work well for straightening hair, but you have to realize that everytime, you are slowly weakening or damaging your hair, everytime you straighten it.   To make it easier you might want to try a natural relaxer. Unlike chemical relaxers with ly and other harsh treatments, it doesn't straigten you hair.  instead it softens the curls so that it's easier to straighten and also your hair stays straight longer.it's not as susceptible to frizzing when it's humid or such.<br>  The regime that the person listed above, will also help to keep your hair in order.

Si usamos una base muy oscura el polvo puede ser mas oclaro, si usamos una base de un tono más que la piel, el polvo puede ser del mismo color que la base.<br>  4) Ojos: <br>  Iluminador: Se aplica con pincel desde la ceja hasta las pesta?as. Siempre usamos un color claro (blanco, beige, etc.). Colores brillantes.<br>  Primera Sombra: Se aplica con pincel desde el borde de las pesta?as hasta donde termina el párpado móvil, saturándolo y esfumándolo. Siempre es un poco más oscura que el iluminador, teniendo en cuenta la vestimenta. Colores brillantes.<br>  Segunda Sombra: Se aplica con pincel de esponja en el párpado fijo, desde el lagrimal hasta el último tercio. Al llegar al último tercio subimos un poco hasta él quiebre del ojo. Se satura desde afuera hacia dentro. Siempre es un poco más oscura que la primera sombra.  Se puede hacer la profundidad un poco mas en punta y dándole un toque mas rasgado a los ojos. Colores brillantes.<br>  Se puede delinear debajo del ojo por fuera con el mismo color de la sombra que usamos para la profundidad, saturando desde afuera hasta llegar al  lagrimal.<br>  Delineador: Se aplica delineador líquido.<br>  Arriba: Se aplica desde el lagrimal y lo subimos en el último tercio del ojo.  (Puede ser un poco más ancho que el maquillaje de tarde, siempre teniendo en cuenta el tama?o del ojo, y continuar un poquito más).<br>  Debajo: Se aplica por fuera del ojo, saturando desde afuera hasta llegar al  lagrimal. (esto siempre que no hayamos delineado con sombra).             <br>  Rimel: Se aplican con el mismo pincel del rimel.<br>  Arriba: Se sostiene con los dedos las cejas tirando hacia arriba, y se aplica con el pincel del mismo rimel por arriba y debajo de las pesta?as bien saturado.<br>  Debajo: Se pincela con la punta del pincel del mismo rimel.<br>  5) Labios: Se puede jugar con los colores y los brillos.<br>  Pasos: <br>  Delinear: Se aplica el delineador sobre el contorno de la boca cerrada.<br>  Rellenar: Se pasa el pincel en el labial y se aplica en la boca.<br>  Fijar: Se aplica con brocha un polvo volátil blanco y luego se vuelve a delinear y rellenar. Así logramos mayor fijación y duración del labial.<br>  6) Rubor: Se aplica con una brocha. Se dibuja una línea imaginaria que va desde donde termina la ceja hasta el pómulo.<br>  7) Polvo Volátil traslucido: Colocar con brocha en toda la cara como toque final, para dar luminosidad (de color opaco)|`|24a86637782b048524c5e56482202818aa	-|`|93b43bc658d90144c22b2879929903fdaa	si la fiesta es de noche el maquillaje debe ser un poco cargado y delineate los labios con un color mas subido que el de el labial.|`|eb430530a1370b8259970b0701dde5a5aa	?De dónde eres, remera?

But, it will all be one color.. Your question is a little confusing.. You can't color the new growth to make it lighter then the color it is now, only darker.. In other words, Don't go get a box of light brown hair color & put it on your dark brown/grey hair and expect to get the results on the box.  Pick a color that is just one shade darker then your new growth but not lighter.. Apply the color to your new growth first. Wait 10 minutes then apply to your highlighted hair for a total of 20 more minutes. Rinse. Good luck!|`|ac42e310ad5bcc9507b1c7716541a914aa	i would just let in grow out and stick with your natural hair color for while|`|bf0ed9359eff6a68cd92a93c7dd88745aa	dye it

Xk2SIv1raa	The regular hair dye that they use is dangerous, but if ou make a trip to Sally's Beauty Supply, they have a special dye made for eyebrows. It's the greatest!

If he/she is willing to do it, go for it!|`|d0fe082908bd39fdd7f696fca2ae0862aa	yeah! get someone professional|`|EWZk0Dscaa	I would go to a beauty therapist instead, for two reasons,<br>  1: they use a vegetable dye that is suited to the eye area instead of the harsh ammonia based dyes from the hairdresser, and<br>  2: Beauty therapists are trained to tint brows into an actual shape to suit your face and features. eyebrows can make or break your look.<br>  good luck!|`|b3430d38fb386238b5e4479a39911ce8aa	well if you cant trust your hairstylist who was taught in making up hair then who else can you trust?|`|vcOiGu6eaa	Not at all!  So many people have their brows colored.  It's as safe as having your hair colored and can completely change your look.  I love having mine done.  It makes such a huge difference!<br>  <br>  If you have it done, it will definitely make them look thicker and frame your face better, especially since they are light currently.

Like a bob, shoulder-length, or hair that's shorter in the back and goes on an angle and longer in the front.<br>  <br>  Also, thick headbands and metallic hair accessories are in.<br>  <br>  And don't use a lot of the shine product. A better idea is to just use white vinegar. Take a little and put in some warm water and pour on your head after shampooing. Then rinse it out with warm water. It gives your hair shine, without product. But if you do use the hair shine product, only use a little or it'll look wet and greasy.<br>  <br>  :)|`|8Ko7vXvWaa	There is no real "in" style, but the style I see most often is straight and smooth, with a little side bang.

06a4f096e4837f12617ece69a77a4af9aa	coucou!<br>      Voila je te réponds puisque j'ai fait l'expérience de l'épilation laser dernièrement. Cependant je ne l'ai fait que pour le maillot... pas pour les jambes. Mais ?a peut quand même servir! Donc voila:<br>      Tout d'abord, je suis allée voir une dermatologue qui m'a dit que je pouvais le faire. Attention, toutes les peaux et tous les poils ne s'y prêtent pas!! Si tu es mate ou bronzée ou si tes poils sont trop clairs, le rayon du laser va être absorbé par la peau et non par le poil, ce qui entra?ne des br?lures.<br>      Suite a l'obtention de l'"autorisation" la dermato m'a dit quelle était habilitée à le faire. L'appareil co?te cher, en général les médecins se mettent a plusieurs pour l'acheter ou utilisent celui d'une clinique.  <br>      Pour la fréquence cela dépend, c'est le doc qui va le déterminer. Suivant la surface a traiter, la couleur des poils, leur densité et surtout s'il partent bien. Moi elle m'a dit que j'en avais pour 4 ou 5 séances (mais elles est restée floue, avant la 2 ème séance, je pense qu'il ne peuvent pas le prédire).<br>     Pour le prix: Elle m'a fait payer 80€ la séance. Je rappelle que c'était pour le maillot! je ne sais pas du tout combien c'est pour les jambe, ?a dépend de la surface.<br>     Douleur? oui un peu, mais c'est supportable (le maillot est en général plus sensible que les jambes!). C'est un peu comme si on nous pin?ait avec une pince à épiler. Par contre ?a sent le poulet!! lol. Le bulbe du poil absorbe la lumière du laser et ?a la fait exploser, ?a sent comme lorsqu'on br?le un cheveu. ?a fait une toute petite étincelle blanche et on voit le poil se coucher. Quand on sort de la séance on n'a donc plus de poil. <br>      La fréquence: Environ tous les 3 mois. Il faut attendre que les poils repoussent. On voit le résultat dés la 1ère séance (la pilosité est moins dense). <br>      En fait j'y suis allée 3 fois. Je n'y suis pas retournée parce que la dermatho n'est pas très agréable et que je n'ai pas assez d'argent en ce moment pour y retourner... :( Mais après 3 séance les poils sont rares. Je peux les enlever juste en tirant dessus et il repoussent beaucoup moins vite après épilation par cire. <br>      Je pense que ?a vaut le coup d'essayer quand même!! mais il faut consulter avant!!<br>      Si vous tardez trop vous ne pourrez pas le faire l'été! Le fait d'être bronzé est rédhibitoire. d'ailleurs ma dermatho m'a fait une séance avant les vacances (Mai) et m'a demandée de revenir que fin octobre quand le bronzage et parti...<br>  <br>     Bon j'espère avoir été utile. et bonne épilation si je vous ai convaincues ;)<br>     Ti l?|`|58d391b25d9a867566b445a64218e843aa	moi je l'ai fait chez mon dermatologue<br>  les poils partent quasi définitivement , il faut une séance d'entretien a peu près tous les 5 ans<br>  pour moi, j'ai fait le maillot à raison de 75 euros par séance, sur une période d'à peu près  un an (une séance ttes les 6 semaines) mais les prix différent selon la taille de la zone à traiter il me semble<br>  et non il faut arrêter les idées re?ues, ?a ne fait pas mal, ?a chauffe bien par contre mais ?a reste plus que supportable|`|b126f8c1ec8aca211fa34a5bb8b655b5aa	non pas definitivement|`|dbc3874a12a783cc8b8498d47b3deb74aa	Je connais bien le pb de l'epilation definitive et il faut savoir que ce n'est jamais definitif ! <br>  J'ai essayé le laser et ?a co?te cher ! en moyenne une centaine d'euros par seance mais ?a depend les zones que tu veux traiter ! <br>  En moyenne il faut 10 à 12 séances pour tuer un bulbe "définitivement" !<br>  l'avantage c'est qu'entre les séance tu ne trouvera pas de poils !<br>  les séances sont espacées soit 2 mois après ta 1ere séance ! <br>  l'inconvenient comme je te l'ai dit c'est que c'est long et que c'est un budget !<br>  après le laser je me suis lancée dans l'epilation electrique et l'avantage c'est que ?a marche mieux !<br>  l'inconvenient c'est que tu aura de toutes petites croutes qui partiront en une semaine environ.<br>  C'est moin cher que le laser car la seance d'une heure est à 50 € (dans le cabinet medical où je vais) mais comme je te l'ai dit même si beaucoup de personnes sont septique par rapport à cette pratique qui etait utilisées bien avant le laser moi je pense continuer encore. Mon medecin m'a dit qu'il fallait piquer 1 poil environ 10 fois pour qu'il ne repousse plus mais beaucoup n'ont pas repoussé à la 1ere séance !<br>  maintenant il faut voir avec le temps ! mais je te conseille de bien te renseigner et si tu compte faire du laser adresse toi a un centre medical ou ce sera des medecin qui te le feront ! parce que beaucoup d'institut pratiquent le laser mais en realité c'est la lumière pulsée qu'ils utilisent car ils n'ont pas l droit d'utiliser le laser medical !<br>  <br>  Demande s'ils utilisent l'alexandrite (c'est le laser que j'ulilisais et il est pratiqué par des medecins) bien s?r je ne les connais pas tous mais celui -la est assez fiable !|`|5294076f4b6d81a9c2bfb1d178309eb0aa	Personnellement, j'y pense très souvant à l'épilation au laser car j'ai les jambes très poilus et je déteste ?a.

cb7fb54f57e95f4c9866196c961367d6aa	Bonjour,<br>  L'huile d'Argan est excellente pour l'entretien des ongles (ainsi que pour la peau, les cheveux...). Il faut vous masser les mains tous les jours en insistant sur les ongles. Vous pouvez également mettre du durcisseur. Cette huile est un peu cher mais elle vaut le coup.

But usually if people stare at you enough they generally know when you wear it whether it looks good or not. The best one so far that I have found is Covergirl's clean make-up. It washes off with water so it doesn't stay that long but it is really light. To make it stick you have to put the matching pressed powder over it to set it and walk out the door. Three minutes tops and you look fresh and natural.

Juniors clothing usually has a younger attitude than misses, but most people can find styles they like in both lines.  If you want more classic conservative go for misses.  If you want more trendy you might want to look at juniors 1st.  I believe juniors is usally odd numbered sizes and misses is usually even numbered.  Juniors can have even numbers sometimes.  Juniors runs a little bit smaller.

VHnVBZhVaa	Why don't you ask the person who gave it to you where it came from.  Without a photo or more details it will be impossible for anyone to know where it came from.
VHnVBZhVaa	It depends on the brand because they vary a little bit.  Twenty-seven to 28 would be the average.
VHnVBZhVaa	I used to work at Macy's when I was in school.  The interview is pretty basic.  What department do you want to work in -or- if one is already assigned are you comfortable in that department?  What attributes do you have that will make you a good fit for this job?  Sometimes they ask you to pretend to sell them something, like your top or cell phone.  They may ask what you will do if you encounter a difficult customer (ask a manager, be polite, do your best to resolve, etc) and they may ask you to describe how you have handled a difficult situation in the past.  Basically they are trying to see if you are polite, well-spoken and mature.  Look nice for your interview and be yourself.  They are basically looking for people who present themselves in a friendly, professional manner.  Good luck!

You can get it at beauty salons (not the ones in the small dinky towns though) or you can get it at beauty supply stores like Sally's. they tend to be cheaper when you go to beauty supply stores. But beware, the CHI can damage your hair very badly if not used properly. you can't just use it like a normal straightner, you must take a small section of your hair and straighten it in a swift quick motion, no longer than 5 seconds.  It's the fastest heating straightner in the world, it'll kill your hair if not used properly. Since you have wavy hair, i would actually just go with a normal $15 straightner from drug stores or wal mart. I used to use one like that, but my hair is so curly and crazy that they will not work for my hair anymore, i had to switch to the CHI! good luck!|`|5da93cb703d7e0ccc2f87ca72b081c98aa	u could straighten it everyday or u could go to a salon and get it straightened.|`|Y4mlbo87aa	This might,might not help because you're getting this from a twelve year old,but have you tried getting a straightener...i mean i use a straightener and it works just fine but if it doesnt help...sorry!!!<br>        Luv alwaz<br>   !ToRi n!|`|AA12360257	chi|`|e8180736fab1d68df48a26360afd8196aa	use a strightener
