bsyBURdFaa	Well in the theatre i imagine it will be warm but outside it will be freezing maybe wear a vest top underneath your shirt?|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	8 degrees will feel like 2 if there's just a slight wind. A cardigan is definetely not enough.<br>  It's 8 outside right now and I'd wear a long sleeve inside + jeans + coat + scarf.<br>  You can wear a tank top + cardi + warm vest it'll be good enough|`|D5lsLbdUaa	f
SrRJNzJOaa	Yes I have. I mixed water and cacao together. Im not sure if it helped though. It felt kindda wierd and was hard to put on. I would not really recomend it.
6aw3naCNaa	Lol<br>  <br>  Strong hold Gel, wax and Hairspray<br>  <br>  And lots of it lol.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	take a picture to the barbers and they will do it for you....  Grant M|`|oENKYc7Kaa	to help hold the style wash or wet the hair and dry it to your style. you can put the hard hold gel in it wet. Then when it's dry put more hard hold gel to complete the look. You really need a good gel that will hold.|`|heVrVDGEaa	Use gel and hairspray, maybe tease the hair if it's on the thin side.|`|dfc1e48c9b6824c1517f4ae1d5945f0aaa	use a HECK of a lot of hair gel and some luck
SrRJNzJOaa	Id go with the red mango. It will look so good on you!|`|tqYpkDyEaa	I've never heard of them - but they look cool!  Anything with natural ingredients are the best things to moisturize.<br>  <br>  Hm, I would definitely go with the peach.  It would be a nice contrast with your skin tone.  Or, if you want to go more pink, try the strawberry.  It would also have nice contrast.  Hope I helped!|`|5Fwuya29aa	i like the natural look, so i'd go for the peach.  it'll suit you, plus you can wear it with anything/any other make up because it is quite a nude tone as well.|`|nZgZWrGWaa	red mango!!! Yummy.....|`|a4ya6aSRaa	I know you like those but maybe try an orange tinit color that would look really pretty with your skin tone!|`|IUGS32wfaa	I'd go with either the red mango, which would make your lips really pop and look colorful, or if you just want a glossy one get the french vanilla. Good luck!|`|FEILPG67aa	I think you should get the french vanilla one. cause its like a gold color and that would look great with your skin color. :D good luck!
EaSEjCMZaa	What the hell? She bit your nipple lmfao what did she think it was?<br>  <br>  Anyways, I can't really decide where the scratch marks came from because I'm not God and watch your every move, but they could most likely be the same scratch marks from 4 months ago. Do you remember leaning up against anything that could've scratched you? Maybe you were so stoned that the girl that was trying to eat your nipple scratched you and you didn't realize it.<br>  <br>  lol @ "so that rules out kinky sex"|`|FhhUylbaaa	Stretch marks are caused by breakage of your skin.  It doesn't hurt.  They are caused by rapid weight gain or loss, and pregnancy.  To prevent them shea,cocao butter will strengthen the skin and make it stronger so that you won't get it.  There are special creams to make the apparance fade.  So just google it.  For more info go to Wikipedia.com God Bless.|`|lVZyP9KMaa	i wake up with an occasional scratch, but never on my back.|`|6aw3naCNaa	I always wake up with scratches on me<br>  <br>  I do them myself in my sleep n when im having a nightmare or something.<br>  <br>  x|`|5jsMY4RIaa	Maybe you get a midnight vistor. *wink wink*<br>  <br>  no, you probably did it to yourself in your sleep.
tqYpkDyEaa	It does actually work!  I used it in the summer every night.<br>  <br>  But if you want to get rid of dark circles I suggest doing these things first:<br>  <br>  1) Make sure you sleep A LOT. 8-10 hours per day.<br>  2) Drink A LOT of water. 8 glasses per day - at least.<br>  3) Moisturize. Before you go to bed (and when you wake up), get a moisturizer and apply a thin layer under each eye, don't rub it all the way in.<br>  4) Tea bags. Get a green tea bag, and soak it in some hot water. Then, put over your eyes for about twenty minutes, or until the bag loses its heat.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Kind of. It feels really good to put it on...the little rollerball is cool to the touch and helps bring down the puffiness. I'm not sure I saw an improvement in the dark circles though.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I've never tried it, but have a friend who has and I don't see results. With dark circles you need tomake sure you are getting enough sleep and drink lots and lots of water.|`|qq0fH3oTaa	hmm.. so so <br>  i used it more a something to wake me up in the morning as its quite a fresh feeling !<br>  <br>  xo heatherrr xo
tqYpkDyEaa	I personally like the HollisterCo Cali Wear Dark Wash the best.  <br>  <br>  Darker jeans give the appearance of a classier girl.  Plus, they look less tacky and you can wear them with anything.  I'd definitely go with those.|`|SrRJNzJOaa	I like the last one. B/C u can never do anything wrong by wearing hollister. Also they are skinny jeans, meaning that you can also wear them with uggs.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I like the distressed ones. I'm a ripped jeans kinda girl, but I really like the last hollister ones. I have always liked the really dark ones.|`|YoY8fyqzaa	I like the darks one better.<br>  The last one.
ERjGLJaEaa	I like the first one. the blue color is really pretty and I like the lace.|`|IUGS32wfaa	I like the first one better. The blue is really pretty and it looks like it's longer, and i tend to like that style better, hahah. The lace looks really pretty too.|`|FEILPG67aa	I like the 1st one. but I don't like the color. I like it better when its like hot pink though. and i reallly like the lace.<br>  :P|`|NVAVj7doaa	I like the first one, because of the lace|`|YoY8fyqzaa	Both are good.<br>  but i like the first one.<br>  this second one looks like it would be kinda short.<br>  ya know?|`|JF343E2Taa	the first one it's pretty|`|vCbM6yJfaa	i like the second one in grey or turquise<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  its really pretty and casual|`|YGMP9nKBaa	I like the first one better because the second one is too plain,but get the first one in a different color|`|v1NfdN1Naa	I love the first one.<br>  I have itt.(:
tqYpkDyEaa	I would definitely say wax them.  I'd rather be looking at a guy with neat eyebrows rather than one with two bushes on his forehead.|`|bet4Cugjaa	The guy probablly think it's "gay" or i'm guessing doesn't wanna have it done? But it's not like that at all, no offense, but it's unattractive if a guy has eyebrows like that. You know? Getting em' waxed would not be a big deal at all.|`|P0qTmwtFaa	it makes him look like a girly sissy boy, men aren't supposed to be so groomed in my oppinion, they're supposed to have hair, but plucking the odd unruly hairs ok as long as it isnt in excess|`|v6un21wYaa	Yes, but be careful with this because sometimes when guys wax it tends to look a little too defined and can look too feminine for they're face. Just be careful with this one. :)|`|F6K4mNBUaa	Why can't he just shave them a little? Getting them waxed makes them look like a pretty boy, and not a man. It's totally a turn off for me...|`|5uHxFJpAaa	I think that it is fine, why shouldn't guys get their eyebrows waxed? If it will make him look better then definately go for it :)|`|KFuyBR8qaa	definately agree with harper. <br>  wax, it shows they care about their appearance at least.|`|nZgZWrGWaa	its alright with me.....if its not good, fix it!|`|sABg7dwCaa	Just neaten them up a little. Don't make it obvious they're waxed. Too thin brows don't look good on anyone, guys or girls, unless you're trying to look like a 1940's pinup girl.|`|6D8BI1ffaa	Very gay|`|ERjGLJaEaa	If my guy was like that I'd rather have him wax than have big ugly brows.|`|iZDsMCghaa	If they are that unruly, that they can be trimmed, NOT shaped|`|UojyaVglaa	wax away! please! guys are so much sexier with two eybrows instead of one.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	weird. guys eyebrows are supposed to be bushy and shiz. I don't want my guys eyebrows to look prettier than mine.|`|TfEBIjxZaa	I think it's fine if guys wax their eyebrows.|`|XyhVhvUuaa	I think great.<br>  Shows he looks after his appearance.<br>  :)

Ich habe auch zwei S?hne (4 und 6), und habe zwar keine Schwangerschaftsstreifen, aber es ist halt nicht mehr so wie vorher. Ich glaube, dass es halt am Selbstbewusstsein nagt, wenn man zwar das gleiche Gewicht hat wie vorher, aber halt alles schlaffer ist. Rausgehen, Leute kennenlernen, etc. .

Try Sally's for one of those.

oiwR103Saa	PUEDES SOLUCIONAR TU PROBLEMA CON SOLO COMPRAR EL ANTI FRIZZ DE MATRIX ESE ES UNICO, LO ENCUENTRAS EN SALONES DE BELLEZA DE PRESTIGIO Y CUESTA COMO 17 DLLS. PERO TE APLACA EL PELO O ME DEJO DE LLAMAR DIANA,|`|3cDj93mtaa	Hola:<br>  Por q no intentas un corte de cabello distinto igual y es lo q necesitas, si solo quieres levantar las puntas con la secadora y un fijador es mas q suficiente, pero si no te da resultado haste la base o no?<br>  Suerte bye.|`|ARh1jNcTaa	Hola.<br>  Me pasa lo mismo.<br>  Lo k te recomiendo es k compres un buen shampoo anti-frizz o anti-sponge, con su balsamo y la crema para peinar.<br>  Tambien comprate un suero especial anti-frizz, que te elimina el frizz y te lo deja brillante.<br>  Despues del banho, en la palma de la mano, ponte unas pocas gotas del suero anti-frizz y una poco cantidad de la crema para peinar, pasatelo de medias a puntas y si tienes frizz en la parte de arriba, pasate una pekenhisima cantidad para k no te vaya a kedar tieso.<br>  Puedes provar tambien, con las siguientes mascarillas, puesto k tu pelo es seco, pero esto no kiere decir k el cuero cabelludo tan bien lo sea.<br>  Tu pelo necesita proteinas, asi k una bna mascarilla de dos huevos te puede servir.<br>  Te la untas en todo el pelo, masajeando en el cuero cabelludo, te pones un gorro y encima una toalla humedecida en agua tibia. Espera de 20 a 30 minutos y enjuagas, para el olor, hazlo antes del shampoo y el balsamo.<br>  Tambien ayuda una mascarilla de aguacate y savila, haz lo mismo k en la anterior.  Ademas la savila lo nutre y suaviza ( el cabello).<br>  Trata de lavarlo con agua templada, no tibia, templada, preferiblemente fria pero no tanto. Y cuando te vayas a dar el ultimo enjuague, hazlo con agua fria, lo k le dara brillo.<br>  No olvides: shampoo y balsamo anti-frizz  o sponge y la crema para peinar tambien anti-frizz. <br>  El suero anti-frizz y las mascarillas.<br>  Espero te sirva.<br>  Suerte !.|`|WfEGJys3aa	yo tambien lo tenia asi. se me demoro para poder mejorarlo use muchos tratamientos. preguntaba y todo me decian en la peluqueria que comprara el anti-frizz  que ellos usaban pero pues costaba muchoooooo. mira yo use mucho el aceite de olvia de aplcas en al parte que esta matratado. te lo tienes que dejas mas d 4 horas pero yo me lo dejaba toda la noche. lo usaba cada 15 dias pero lo puedes usar cada semana y comprate un shampoo para pelo  matratado. yo compre el de pantene restoratives es verde pues ahi tu lo buscas. y tambien ayuda que cortes las puntas antes de empezar hacerte todo eso <br>  la verdad me ha mejorado demasiado. tampoco te lo lavez muy seguido. si lo tienes muy seco y t lo lavas muy seguido estas acabando con la grasa que el pelo produce. tienes que esperar para que recuperes la grasa despues de que te lo lavas. por la noche normalemnte se recobra. intenta lo que te dije. tambien busca mas  en internet ahi encuantras todo. y pues ten paciencia. espro que te halla ayudado. aunque fue u poco larog y enredado pero mira haber si si me entendistes jeje bueno saludos|`|CIb2SSREaa	te podras cortar el pelo un poco y utilizar los productos especiales para tu cabello, por ejem. pantene suele ser muy bueno!!|`|kuEHO2Lkaa	te recomiendo que utilises lo adecuado pregunta en una pelukeria|`|WLDqgRqQaa	Hola..!<br>  te recomiendo que para disumularlo uses mousse en TODO EL PELO...<br>  Para disminuirlo hay que hidratarlo, ponte aguacate, dejatelo 30 minutos y enjuagalo..|`|NFp1mwQtaa	jajajajja....me uno a tu suplica HELP!!!! a mi tambien me ataca el sponch!!!! y me niego rotundamente a secarmelo cada 3 dias.... no tengo ninguna solicion aunque ayuda un poco que te hagas el rollete o la vuelta antes de dormir (es enrollrate el cabello alrededor de tu cabez y sujetarlo con pinzas)
SazACmb8aa	I have a cousin who uses that product, and her hair is the best i've ever seen, u don't need to get fancier stuff<br>  when applying it (to ur DAMP hair if it's too wet, then u'll wash most of the product right out, so it won't have as much effect) take individual strands and twist around fingers gently if hair is not so curly, but if ur hair is really curly than u don't need to<br>  if u have thicker or longer hair, i suggest applying a little more and if its not working still and u have short hair, than apply a little bit more anyway (not too much)<br>  and make sure before ur putting it on, to rub it imbetween ur hands|`|z9yUGK0Raa	don't use it at all and go to your stylist and ask for decent products that she can show you how to use properly.<br>  <br>  that **** is terrible for your hair.  just so you know.
gloORKAMaa	c'è un prodotto buonissimo che si chiama Licaria, è una specie di cremina rossa, devi passarla con costanza sulle pellicine e quella ammorbidisce quelle dure e rimuove le cuticole naturalmente. Costa sui 5 Euro.<br>  Altrimenti ho visto una cosa simile della Deborha in confezione di carta. é alla fragola ed è una specie di gel rosa con le stesse funzioni. Questo costa sugli 8 Euro.<br>  Sono molto buoni anche i prodotti della MAVALA (che sono sempre specifici per unghie)<br>  Comunque se vai in profumeria e chiedi un prodotto rimuovi cuticole avrei una bella scelta...|`|3m3cJC96aa	devi mettere a bagno le punte delle dita in acqua tiepida con un po' di sapone, poi metti un po' di normalissima crema idratante piuttosto corposa sui bordi "interni" dell'unghia- o anche una specifica per ammorbidire le cuticole, se vuoi. poi con un bastoncino di legno d'arancio passi tutto il contorno tra dito e unghia, per staccare le pellicine. quindi asciughi e usi non le forbicine - orrore! - ma un tronchesino per pellicine, reperibile in tutte le profumerie e supermercati. meglio se è di buona qualità altrimenti invece di tagliare le pellicine le strappa! taglia solo la parte "morta" delle cuticole", altrimenti ti riempi di taglietti! di solito si sconsiglia di eliminare le cuticole della parte più interna e si tende a limitarsi ad eliminare le pellicine più vicine alla punta delle dita. è un'operazione semplicissima, basta un po' di pratica: parola di estetista!|`|9193d1c3969909ffcd09e1026ac42da9aa	compra una penna che si compra in profumeria dell'LCN funziona!|`|ac0b04b46790f4ac56f05af9ed05542faa	Metti le unghie in acqua calda cosi le pellicine si ammorbidiscono e poi copri le forbicine apposta per eliminarle una volta finito metti intorno un po di cremina idratante.|`|31f804df8146c8287199bd400c237002aa	Io uso il tagliaunghie...so che c'è un prodotto specifico che si trova facilmente nei negozi specializzati per la cosmetica oppure in profumeria..ammorbidisce le cuticole che poi vanno rimosse con un bastoncino di legno particolare..|`|3e1bf060a2998b4dfb23a5aaf6388638aa	senti senza spendere e spandere, un cotton fioc imbevuto di banale e sano ed utilissimo olio jhonson dei bambini, passato sulle pellicine,|`|60b29b95e0f3beb50ff9568dffbda458aa	esistono delle forbicine apposite<br>  se poi non ci riesci vai da un estetista|`|e01e4da4453f9183bc4ff05d0f30ef43aa	taglia le dita, eliminerai il problema alla radice|`|e83a3bc929dcc6f8e5d52442f5ab97ebaa	io ho sempre fatto con la forbicina, non troppo piccola però perchè se no ci si fa male, e non mi è successo nulla!!!!

e3lXgf7Uaa	NAH.<br>  WHEN YOU SHAVE IT, IT NEVER GROWS BACK.<br>  Same with all hair.<br>  <br>  <br>  your stupid, just sayin'.<br>  <br>  it does grow back.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You only have half a question.  I know you understand the whole situation, but we have nothing to go on.<br>  <br>  Of course hair grows back.  That is what it is supposed to do, which is a good thing.  How often have you pulled out a hair by accident... if that was the end of it, you would be pretty bald in patches, no doubt!<br>  <br>  It all depends on how you remove the hair.  Most are temporary, and when the roots heal, they will grow hair again.  There are permanent methods of removal as well.  Talk to a professional about this.<br>  <br>  To some people, everything is noticeable... and then again, you could shave off all your eyebrows, and they still wouldn't notice.|`|mXpaE6V6aa	any hair you pluck or shave will always grow back. if its really something that bothers you then you will have to be consistent with plucking or waxing it. maybe try laser removal if you can afford it? good luck :)|`|phDTu7c1aa	For awhile it will, but if you pluck it a certain amount of times, some of the hairs will eventually stop growing back.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	keep tweezing it .. every month or so<br>  or try waxing it|`|PmDYyH0naa	yes it does<br>  shaving it makes it grow back thicker<br>  pluck it|`|mqkftyDtaa	If you shave or pluck it once, you have to keep doing it in the future.

jIIHgFC6aa	i dont have black hair..<br>  <br>  but my natural hair color is dark brown. and i had never dyed my hair before but i wanted something different. so i bought the kind of dye that is specifically made for brown hair (im sure its made for black too) and i dyed my hair red. although all my hair isnt red. the dye more or less put red tints to my brown hair. but the red is very noticeable and i love the way it turned out.|`|a59cPOyBaa	mix it with a darker color hair dye it will pick up both the colors and be dark red the way you want it.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You are mixing up a few things here, and it really is not clear what you want, or what you have done already.  You don't seem to grasp the concept of what is going on when you are "dying" hair.<br>  <br>  First, there is "dye" and there are hair colours.  These are not necessarily the same things.  Dyes are used on fabrics, and sometimes on hair, and they do certain things.  Then there are tints, made specifically for changing hair colours, and they do things differently.  You cannot compare the two.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_coloring" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_colori...</a><br>  <br>  You haven't said which you are using.  There are directions for the product and you need to follow them for best results.<br>  <br>  Trying to figure out the results you will get is going to impossible from what you have said.  You really should be having a consultation with a professional hair colourist who can see what hair you have now, and see what colour you wanted.  Then they would know how to get there, and which products to use.  They will have an understanding of the effects of different kinds of products you can use.<br>  <br>  The best advice one can give you is seek the advice of someone that knows what they are doing.  Failing that, you should do a strand test:  mix up a small amount of the colour, and apply according to directions to a strand of the hair, and then see what happens.  You won't know until you do it... and then it might be too late.  Test to be sure.

Don't let them go too skinny, but keep the thickness and have them cleaned up/shaped.  <br>  <br>  I think that your forehead is very nice for NOT having bangs.  However gettting layers in the front of your hair no shorter than your chin might be nice and you can keep it wavy or straight.<br>  <br>  And lastly if you don't like the maintainace of make up keep it simple.  To enhance your lips which you think are small (they aren't they just aren't your dominate feature) use a light gloss with an anything but pink tint to it.  Pink won't work as nicely as other colors with your skin tone.  Use mascara since it makes your dominate feature (Your eyes) just that much better.  And if your skin is acting up you can use cover up and bronzer.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	You look pretty good to me.  I think all you need is just a few things to polish off your look.  First, I think you should shape your eyebrows a bit more.  Make them a little bit thinner but not too much.  Just enough to give them a nice arch and point.  (don't let them get so thin though that they look weird or are too distracting from the rest of your face)  That will really open up your eyes which are gorgeous.  Second, I know you don't want to wear makeup, but you should try this:  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml;jsessionid=IACZX2CRUOQ2ICV0KRRRHOQ?brandID=Bare+Escentuals&id=P220533" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  It will last you a year, it is light, feels like you're not wearing make up and you can touch your face without worrying like you're going to mess it up.  I just convinced my 30yr old makeup hating cousin to buy it by putting it on half her face.  She has great skin, but tends to have dark under eye circles and sometimes she just looks tired.  She saw how subtle it looks and how easy it is to put on and wear and was sold.  Thirdly, you should get some pomade (hair wax) or hair whip to tame those flyaways.  Its not necessary, but you do have gorgeous hair and if you take a pencil eraser sized amount, rub it between your palms and them smooth gently over your hair, it gives your hair a smoother fly-away free look.  And finally 4, get an eyelash curler.  Even if you don't wear makeup, with a nicely shaped brow and curled lashes, your face looks instantly more awake and brighter.  (I like tweezerman curlers  I've tried all the revlon type ones you can get at the drugstore and they just aren't as good)  Oh, and I think you would look very good with both wavy and straight hair.  Lucky you, I wish mine had that versatility!<br>  <br>  ps the startup kit in the link above comes with a very handy how-to dvd.|`|acfd7907edce364d509ad8e43b8f4f0faa	Your face is pretty much round. Round faces are defined by chubby cheeks and a not too well defined chin. I honestly think your nose is just fine. I don't know how it looks from the side view, but from the frontal view it's about normal size and width. Your complexion is rather clear. The only thing I would recommend for makeup would be a concealer. You have very obvious dark eye circles under your eyes. It can help hide it and not make your face appear so tired. If you ever want to wear eye makeup, go with brown colors. Brown eyeliner, brown and gold eyeshadows, brown mascara.<br>  <br>  Your hair is definitely frizzy. Try a leave in hair serum can help prevent frizziness after you wash your hair. I don't know how good straight bangs would look with wavy to curly hair. Wavy hair usually is associated with side bangs, while straight hair usually looks best with full bangs. How do you wear your hair most often? If it's predominately worn natural, I would consider side bangs over straight bangs.

We're all different - they should grow up, accept that and move on instead of spending their sad little lives on forums bugging people about their personal pet hates. What you're after is not my personal cup of tea either, I love tattoos but I wouldn't personally have one for this meaning, but am I you? No! Is your skin mine? No! So how about people either swallow their opinions and attempt to help, or shut up and move to the next question?<br>  <br>  Anyway it really depends what sort of style you're into. I typed in 'girl power symbol' and came up with this - <a href="http://rlv.zcache.com/super_geek_symbol_girl_plaid_photosculpture-p1532350085804963913s98_400.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://rlv.zcache.com/super_geek_symbol_...</a> - I would hate something like that haha but I guess it's an acquired taste!<br>  <br>  You could simply have the female symbol, you know - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/images/2005/05/20/female_sign_lead_203x152.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/derby/content/image...</a> - or a variation I found which is a bit more girl-powerish - <a href="http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl=http://evawhite.com/wp-content/images-blog/female-sign.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.scriboergosum.org.uk/revamp/897&usg=__TCBMM9rWDLpjQbLJTJRZSr33zLE=&h=318&w=283&sz=21&hl=en&start=5&um=1&tbnid=TQHUAAg2SgXaMM:&tbnh=118&tbnw=105&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dfemale%2Bsign%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DG%26um%3D1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.co.uk/imgres?imgurl...</a> (the full size image didn't work but you get the gist).<br>  <br>  Oh here's another take on the female symbol:<br>  <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/thelark06/feminism04.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.freewebs.com/thelark06/femini...</a><br>  <a href="http://harpymarx.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/feminism.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://harpymarx.files.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>  <br>  Similar idea I found: <a href="http://feminist.org/intern/Spring08/Assets/feminist-star.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://feminist.org/intern/Spring08/Asse...</a><br>  <br>  Or you could have a short quote on two lines.<br>  Ideas:<br>  "Never let the hand you hold, hold you down."<br>  "Women belong in the house... and the Senate."<br>  "Feminism is the radical notion that women are people."<br>  "You don't have to be anti-man to be pro-woman."<br>  "History is herstory too."<br>  "Being a lady is an attitude."<br>  "I can't be a rose in any man's lapel."<br>  "Give a woman a job and she grows balls."<br>  "Sexism is a social disease."<br>  "Don't compromise yourself.

Maybe have it more girlish with it done with pink on the inside with black outlining? Since I am a guy, it is hard for me to think of something feminine that deals with strength- I am an artist and design stuff/ideas for people and I don't get women/strength combination that much.

aXqtzNIraa	Hi, infections can happen for many reasons so it's hard to say whether it's because you didn't clean it enough or not.<br>  <br>  Cleaning it more often now is exactly the right way to go to clear up the infection.<br>   a rough guide: <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Body-Piercing" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Clean-a-Body-Pier...</a><br>  <br>  Clean the piercing 1-2 times a day from now on, you should see some improvement fairly quickly, if you don't and are still unsure go back to your piercer for some advice and reassurance or even your doctor for some antibiotics to help clear up the infection.|`|l8yXj7uWaa	Ouchh!  you've properbly introduced the bacteria that is causing you trouble now. <br>  <br>  Here's what I suggest: take a cotton ball and coat one side with an antibiotic ointment (Neosporin or something similar). Then, using a clean washcloth, wrap the cotton ball around your ear lobe where the infection is and apply pressure. Don't squeeze enough to cut off circulation, but enough to cause the pus and lymph (the clear fluids) to drain out. This will probably be uncomfortable, but you don't want it to fester.<br>  <br>  If you want to have your ear remain pierced, you should have a "piercing" stud (which has a heavier shank). Make sure it is clean and disinfected (use rubbing alcohol to clean it). Put it in your piercing and then LEAVE IT THERE for up to six weeks, until your ear has completely healed. Every day, you should apply hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol to the front and back and rotate the earring with your fingers to make sure the liquid gets inside the piercing.|`|SW6fButzaa	First it should be seen if this actually infected, as it is very freente to confuse the sístomas typical process of healing with an infection. <br>  If you are infected pus out "as I have said is dark and you hurt a lot, even without touching it. <br>  According to this if you think that there is no infection, you have to do is cuidartelo washing every day 2 or 3 times with soap and water if there is infection you should separate abonera Put some antibiotic ointment that can pierce your advice.|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	take the earring out, bath with warm salt water and get some anti biotics from doctor|`|IQ0MjIqDaa	What are you using to clean it? I'd do it at least twice a day with peroxide until it stops bleeding. It's just a little infection, but you've GOT to turn the earrings every day, or else your skin could grow around them. Take care of those ears! Claire's sells cheap earrings, so from now on, I'd buy regular earrings elsewhere (I wear mostly silver). But keep using the peroxide, and "twisting" them in the holes twice a day until the infection starts to clear up. If that doesn't work, you might need to see a doctor.|`|CwvoRG3saa	Go to the Dr. and get antibiotics... you don't want to mess with it and risk it getting worse.|`|yl4i5ymmaa	put gass on it|`|67ea71af780ce95553f2ddb1eddee690aa	You're probably allergic to the nickel content in the posts of the earrings. The only ones I can wear are gold and white gold. I can't even wear the stainless or surgical steel or my ears will swell up and become infected. The best thing you can do is remove your earrings and gently wash your earlobes with an antibacterial soap, rinse completely and then put a pair of earrings on that are made of at least 10k gold - minimum. They'll heal in about a week. Just wash them everyday (with the earrings in after the first wash without them).You could also apply Neosporin sparingly to help you avoid infection.|`|pl96lkzIaa	If you weren't cleaning it very often, that's probably why it got infected.  If it's not getting better and you can't get the earring out, you're going to need to go to the doctor.

ybxWfurpaa	To me, theres a difference between cute and hot/sexy.  Cute is as good as a compliment as any but when I call a girl cute I am usually referring to a young pretty face and not necessarily focusing on her body.

szWqfM98aa	Everyone has their own version of a nice body. Live and work with what mother nature gave you. Being confident in your own body is the best sex appeal around regardless of your shape or gender. A flat stomach is nice but there are so many ways you can camouflage the things you don't like about your body with clothing. The key to looking nice is all in what you wear and how you wear it, not if you have a six pack. Exercise and keeping in shape are very important for health reasons not aesthetics. Embrace what you have and hold your head high. If someone doesn't like your body move on, they aren't worth it. I personally like my guys to have some meat on them. Most women I know like to hug teddy bears not hard rocks.|`|AA10239344	personally, i like football players.<br>  if you play football, im sure you'll have a nice body.|`|UgvLTFmSaa	I dont think you need a six pack to have a nice body.<br>  I think people are fine as long as they are not a lot over weight.

Twice a day, if i'm out of my home and when i feel hot or have sweat I will shower before i sleep. If night time, i may use a small wet towel to wipe my body and just wash my face. Sometimes if the weather is hot, then maybe maximum 3 times. Like when i go to do yoga or gym. When sometimes i go massage, after the massage. Sauna or steam. It depends.

8MnjjpJ7aa	Wow, sounds like you are putting alot of thought into it, I would have the Angel sitting on a cloud looking down on the beach w/ the footprints in the sand.

When I got divorced I was angry and went out and got Yosemite Sam with guns drawn.|`|bxlYleZkaa	No such thing as an unlucky tattoo! Footprints are ten a penny at most good studios, have a look on the walls and in their books of "flash" then talk to the tattooist about what you want and see what he comes up with.

I'm not sure even how it would work - what is backwards? Where would you have the tattoo, on your back? If so, which way would be back anyway? I don't think you should listen to superstitions like that, they are obviously not well known and were probably just made up by some paranoid person with too much time on their hands. The only superstition I've heard about a tattoo is 'the curse of the name tattoo' which only refers to partners names - but that's just common sense anyway - but the story goes that people tend to split up fairly soon after having their partners name tattooed. This obviously doesn't apply to your children!<br>  <br>  As for your idea... I'm not sure how big you're wanting this to be but everything you're describing sounds like it's going to end up a scene, which is why I guessed the back? The first thing I envisaged when reading all this was something stretching across the bottom of your back (or if you're silly and discriminatory enough to follow all this 'tramp stamp' pathetic stigmatisation, then perhaps the middle of your back, I can't really see it working at the top) was a line of black footprints half way across the width, as if someone's walked along it, and at the end of the line have your guardian angel kneeling down, with some hints of water in front of him, reaching out to pick up a floating piece of paper or a message in a bottle with your children's names on, as if he's receiving a message to watch over them. And perhaps in the background, above the footprints, the line "The years when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, is when I carried you."|`|fJaZlJQXaa	Your ideas sound so sweet.<br>  Ive never heard that its bad luck to have a tattoo facing backwards. I have a large 'fallen angel' on my back and she's facing outwards! So go for your idea and dont let silly myths put you off.<br>  <br>  As for ideas just google pictures of tattoos and save/print out tattoos that you like or ones that have bits that you like so you can get a drawing done using your fave bits from tattoos.<br>  Also you could go and see a few tattoo artists as alot of the time they will draw up a design for you based on what you've told them. They will probably charge for this but it wont be very much.<br>  A friend of mine drew the design for the tattoo I have after I discussed my ideas with him so ask around and see if any of your friends are creative enough to help you!<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you enjoy your tattoo :)|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	Perhaps the angel could be holding a scroll with your children's names on?<br>  <br>  I have heard the thing about tattoos facing backwards. It's kind of a traditional belief that they should face forwards for the future... I have a koi fish on the top of my foot and this faces forwards (towards my toes) - my artist actually said that he wouldn't do it facing the other way!|`|jCeylLsIaa	Though it would depict something of your belief in the Lord, if you are a Catholic, don't push through with it (it's forbidden for Catholics to put markings on their skin....  .

(Rock of Salvation). The angel could be holding a book open to a page with your kid's names on it. (The Book of Life). Or their names could be on a stone like the one Moses had for the Ten Commandments. As for the footprints maybe you could have them in front of the angel. (Like the angel is looking at someone walk away.) <br>  Most people have their tattoos positioned in such a way that other people can see them. I never heard of it being unlucky, but thats how its typically done. Hope I helped! Good luck!|`|OcY8aV7xaa	Fisrt thing is NO NAMES. over the years your circumstances might change and things that are important to you now may not be in the future. I see no point it having "MUM" or the the kids names or such like, I dont need a reminder of my Mum in such a way, she died many years ago and I still remember her on an almost daily basis. Your kids won't need the reasurance that you seem to think they will, from a tattoo, their reasurance will come from your daily interaction and the way you treat and love them. Tattoo's are not lucky or unlucky but are a manifestation of your feelings for your self and how you think the world views you. One will not change that. Niether does The Lord need your tattoo. <br>  All in all, if YOU want one for artistic reasons or for decoration then go ahead, but to my mind the reasons you are putting forward are best addressed by having more confidence in your self and looking forward, to the lord in needed, to your future and plans.|`|mskwl4zMaa	I am a tattoo artist and I've seen many tattoos like this. Scrolls are always a great way to put names or any words in a tattoo. As for the name superstition... That really only goes for lovers. Having your child's name is very common and special. They say if you get a lovers name you are ginxing the relationship. Then you are left with some dudes name that you don't even care for anymore. You kids will always be your kids.<br>  The best way to get a tattoo that you really like is to look around. Find images online that really stand out to you. Bring as much reference for your tattoo artist that you can. Make sure it makes sense though.<br>  Goodluck|`|AA12103977	Your best bet is to get some pictures of angels/footprints etc. (I'd use google images) Then go to some reputable tattoo artists and ask them how they would put the pictures and your ideas together. Make sure you are comfortable with the artist, and if they are as good as they say they are, they should be able to come up with an idea that you will love. You have to be totally sure of what you are doing as it will be with you forever. Good luck I hope it goes well for you =O)|`|jVjInjjiaa	First of all there won't be one specific site that u can search cause as a tattoo fan I should tell you that a lot of research is what u should do especially if the tat has such an important meaning such as ur children, I can tell you from experience that my first one is the worst one for the fact that I wanted just to get it and I ended up rushing it, so again DO FULL RESEARCH and about the superstitions just don't feed into it because then you will alway have that in your head and you will end up bringing negativity upon urself...

7KDj5bQYaa	? For dark acne scars use lemon juice. Before applying, clean the scars with warm water and dab 1 tsp of lemon juice into a cotton ball and apply it on the scars and leave it for 10-15 minutes.

YjkXyHBuaa	i wouldn't risk it.<br>  you'd probably catch something. :x<br>  but you could always ask around for people who do tattoos at home or something.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Okay, lets spell this out and think a bit logically here...<br>  <br>  <br>  If you have, for example, five businesses.<br>  <br>  Four businesses operate within the law, one doesn't.<br>  <br>  The one that doesn't - why not?<br>  <br>  Why would a tattoo artist, who relies upon his livelihood to provide him with an income, risk losing that business and that income, being chucked out into the street because he can't pay his rent and not having enough money to feed his family, to break the law?<br>  <br>  Hmm...<br>  <br>  He must be pretty desperate, right? To risk his life coming crashing down around his age just to ink up some kids.<br>  <br>  So ask yourself... why is this guy desperate enough to take this risk?<br>  <br>  BECAUSE the alternative is even worse. People only take risks when it is the lesser of two evils. The other evil? He isn't earning enough money doing things the 'proper way' to pay his income and keep his life afloat, so he's taking an all-or-nothing risk.<br>  <br>  Okay so going back to these examples. In this town, why are the four tattoo studios getting enough adult customers to pay their rent, and the other guy not? What makes him different?<br>  <br>  Well, as an adult with all the options - would you pick somewhere that you knew was safe and produced good work, and avoid the unsanitary and unskilled artists?<br>  <br>  Of course you would.<br>  <br>  So, think about it - why is this artist not getting the clients? Because he is unsanitary and/or unskilled. Often both. Not enough adults are choosing to use his studio over the other good studios in the area, so he is resorting to breaking the law and risking his reputation and income to earn a wage.<br>  <br>  These places are businesses. There is reason behind everything. They don't just tattoo underagers because they don't care. They are taking a calculated risk, for the reasons above.<br>  <br>  So, to your situation: Pray, tell me, why on earth would you risk not only your health, but your LIFE (yes, that's right), all to get a crappy tattoo?<br>  <br>  Presuming you don't contract something that sees you off in the meantime... that shitty piece of art will be on your skin for the rest of your years, long after you've grown up and realised a few more years would have been well worth waiting if it meant you could get something GOOD on your skin for the rest of your decades.<br>  <br>  It is common sense. Any intelligent person can see it. Is this REALLY beyond you? REALLY?|`|n68tCJ7zaa	any tattoo parlor that is willing to risk breaking the law for a stupid teenager is desperate and therefore not reputable<br>  <br>  why not wait until you're old enough? i guarantee that when you're of age, you'll have changed your mind on what you want anyways.|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	There are absolutely zero "good underage tattoo parlors" <br>  ....anywhere<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  if a shop will break the law to make a few bucks off of an immature/irresponsible little kid, they (everyone who works there) are idiots.<br>  <br>  if you were mature enough to be permanently marking your body, you'd realize how dumb it is to let one of these people put a needle in your body.|`|wUIJSSJlaa	"good" and "underage tattoo parlors" dont go together.<br>  <br>  any shop that is willing to tattoo minors will not be a good place to go.

Xf03p26laa	Depends on how formal you want it to be.<br>  <br>  Silk duponi, silk jacquard is a good choice since it is a little heavier and typically doesn't wrinkle.  Some polyester/rayon blends will look expensive (and be expensive) and not wrinkle, nor will crepe.<br>  <br>  I also have good luck with crepe backed satin not being too wrinkly.  Style of the dress will also have a lot to do with it: a simple full skirted dress will show any wrinkle less then a complicated column one.

l8yXj7uWaa	The best course of action is to avoid getting them in the first place, if possible. StretchStretchStretch marks have two primary causes: physical and hormonal. StretchStretchStretch marks can be caused by extreme stretching of the skin, which keeps the skin from returning to its original condition. <br>  <br>  Depending on the severity and location of the scar tissue, exfoliation may be helpful. Removing layers of dead skin and unveiling soft, fresh skin can help minimize the appearance of stretch marks. You can use oatmeal or baking soda to make your own preparations, or choose from the many scented, specially prepared formulas available. Be sure to apply plenty of moisturizer to keep the skin soft and hydrated after exfoliation.<br>  <br>  Different types of creams and lotions promise to improve the texture of the skin and make stretch marks less noticeable. Many will provide some relief, but certain preparations are meant for use only on newer scars. Using these preparations on severe stretch marks, or those more than a year old, may not show marked improvement. Read the labels carefully to determine which products are best for you.|`|lfGPmrqdaa	I haven't found anything that removes them completely but to reduces them dramatically, my friends and I swear by Bio-Oil and the sooner the better.

It's taking me forever.|`|7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	It will look messy if you don't use the right products to style it.

I want long back hair but i give up to much to grow mine. There's not enough hair like yours these days, everybody has got short whispy layers and stuff but yours seems natural and healthy sounding. You can do sooo much with long hair, curl it, straighten it, put it up in many different ways. Dont go short, otherwise you'll miss your hair sooo much, believe me :(<br>  <br>  hope i helped.<br>  <br>  x|`|EdB0ghKwaa	No!!  Please don't cut your hair short if you are not sure, you will regret it later (I know I did!!!).<br>  <br>  Your best bet is just to have it trimmed regularly to keep it looking tidy.  Or, just take a few inches off the whole length.  That way you will see if you like it a bit shorter without having to take years to grow it back!|`|Y2ZH2kayaa	i am dying to have long hair back. my current hair is medium length and I cannot do anything with it other than wearing my clip in hair extensions. having real hair is more satisfying than wearing hair extensions so I prefer if you don't cut it. you should give some styles. maybe permanent straight, perm or dye or highlights. =)|`|GDtfZjsiaa	Maintain the length and go far layered cut
FuB7aqI9aa	As mentioned before, you can look at the clearance section. If you can not find your size, don't worry, they will probably have it in the store. They may have stuff online and not in the store, but they also may have things that are not on their website (most  often). So order it online ( I do not recommend it, slow shipping: $10) or hurry in to the store (highly recommended, if you hurry). They usually put their new clothes & clearance  on Thursday & Friday. When going into the store, you will find yourself in a room. Go past the room to the middle room (fitting rooms & registers) or to the next room (which ever comes first) and the second room should be the room with the clearance items (or third if the store has it). Be careful what you buy, some of the clearance items have signs that they are on clearance, but do not have a sticker. The  amount on the sign should be the current price of the item unless some dumb person took a regular item and put it with the clearance.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	look at their clearance section.

Small doses at specific times can go a long way to stopping the cumulative damage of UV rays.<br>  <br>  Mid morning to mid afternoon is the span of time when the sun is the strongest. If you must be outdoors during this period, shade your face with a brimmed hat and cover your arms with long sleeves. The best way to prevent wrinkles begins with this very simple, but effective step.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	I've heard and read that too. It's better to sleep on your back. I've read that past a certain age - you should use a higher concentrate of Retinol-A. You need a prescription from a dermatologist. It's expensive. You can buy a lower dose OTC. Supposedly it's the only stuff that works. Wear sunscreen. That's very important. I wash and apply moisturizer to my face twice a day. <br>  <br>  With creams - it takes time and regular applications to see results. It's temporary. It fills in wrinkles basically.|`|OOYc7Mbfaa	Don't smoke.<br>  Drink plenty of water.<br>  Get lots of exercise.<br>  Use plenty of moisturizer - best is Albolone with or without makup.<br>  Wrinkles are normal and they are going to happen, but these are the things you can do that will prevent them from happening prematurely.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	do not use cocoa butter on your face it can break you out. you should always wear sunblock and get a facial like a glycolic peel or microdermibrasion you can do this at home or at a dermatologist office.and use a good night cream.

How do you even know they are ugg boots? They don't look like ugg boots to me, and they're not on the ugg website.<br>  <br>  2nd. When was this picture taken? If it was taken years ago, chances are, those boots aren't sold any more.<br>  <br>  3rd. It says, 'model-russia'. This means that those boots are probably russian.<br>  <br>  So in the end, the boots you want are probably not sold any more, and if they are, they're most likely not UGG and are only sold in Russia.<br>  <br>  You can find boots that are similair, but now is a stupid time to try and buy boots anyway, because all the shops are selling clothes and footwear for summer.|`|d8EYaNw2aa	<a href="http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=6997525" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/set?id=69975...</a>|`|t5t9rdCpaa	They look like fluff momma, I think you can buy them on <a href="http://www.Ugg-Boot-Sale.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Ugg-Boot-Sale.com</a>|`|xBleAz7oaa	I like boots too
qhKP68eiaa	Avoid "warm" tones.  If you do it at home, then it should be clearly marked on the box.  "Cool" tones usually do not have the red colors in them.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	you could dye your hair blue.... theres no red in that.... my hair is blue|`|W89Q30J7aa	Most hair colours do have an element of red in them, even neutral colours, ash blonde would never have red tones, but it would have a more darker, greyer blonde which would probably suit the more mature skin, Or try a cool brown, unless you use bleach blonde hair dyes ain't the best at covering as they don't have the same depth as a salon would use as they have to make it suitable fro home use, so i suggest light ash blonde or cool light brown!!|`|IPoaeWXPaa	you can buy silver shampoo, i don't know why its called this because its actually a DARK purple colour. Schwarkskopf (i think thats how u spell it) do a good one. For a big bottle its about 7 or 8 pounds but u can also get a smaller bottle for about 2pounds. Its usually beside the hair dyes rather than the shampoos. Just ask as its usually quite hard to find.<br>  I dont have grey hair, mine  is blonde but its great for taking away the brassy tones in blonde hair but my gran also uses it too.|`|V1wDqlvnaa	what color did you have before you started coloring your hair?<br>  <br>  what you can do is strip the color, and then apply a color with a brown base. make sure to stray away from colors with red bases. Keep in mind if you had a red undertone in the past this might be why because red is a very hard color to get rid of|`|iPsJPQ8faa	Stay away from any colors that have the word "Golden" in it.  DO look for the ones that have "Beige" in it.  Problem fixed! :)  (even the ones that say "Natural" blonde, can still give off brassy tones of yellow/red etc.)
oVxr5B3Eaa	House parties are very casual. Jeans and a t-shirt. Don't wear anything white because you don't want to get drinks spilled on it. Don't bring an expensive bag or wear expensive shoes or clothes because they can very easily get wrecked, ripped, stepped on, spilled on, ocassionally burned, and in the case of shoes, purses and coats, stolen. It'll likely be fairly warm as well if it's really going to be a lot of people so if you dress in layers make sure your sweater isn't expensive in case you put it down. <br>  Depends on your style, but I would wear (depending on your style)<br>  1. If your a little more punk/emo/etc, Skinny jeans, a t-shirt or hoodie or something like that, and a tote (to carry all your things, like wallet, cell phone, drinks, sweater if you have one... you don't want to put your things down unless you know the host and can put them in a locked room so you should carry them) and just normal runners (make sure they're clean)<br>  2. If your a little more classier and like to dress up (like me), you could either wear a cute dress (but tone down the accessories) or nice dark jeans, heels (make sure you can walk well in them.. if not, stick to flats) and a cute halter top/tank/top/blouse/bar shirt) and then a bigger purse to carry your things. <br>  <br>  Make sure you don't put down your drink EVER, don't leave your things unattended, don't wear anything expensive or bring anything expensive, don't let things like your cell phone out of your sight... Remember if you bring it it's possible it can get lost/stolen/spilled on/wrecked in some way so make sure your camera is in a case.. things like that. <br>  <br>  Make up.... Just do whatever you would normally do to dress up a little. I would personally wear lip gloss, eyeliner, eyeshadow, mascara, and under eye concealer (I stay away from foundation and powder and stuff but thats your choice)... Hair, just do whatever is comfortable. <br>  <br>  Just make sure your comfortable and wear shoes that you can walk well in because you may have to navigate through a crowd if there are a lot of people. MOst people just wear the same type of thing they would wear to school to house parties, they're really casual, but dress up a little if you want. Don't overdo it with makeup/jewelry/fancy clothes because you'll look out of place and if you wear a skirt or a dress make sure you wear shorts underneath it because drunk boys might want to try and touch your bum (true story). <br>  <br>  Just remember... Party = beerpong/flipcup = booze flying everywhere = all over you = your going to come home covered in liquor.|`|IbnknlP4aa	Anything that you're comfortable with.

W89Q30J7aa	first off u cant strip grey hair, it goes grey because the pigment leaves the hair, so to strip it, it would be useless, it'd just make your hair fall out, yes u can dye grey hair but it is harder to do so i suggest going salon if u cant afford to then go 2 a big department store where there is a large variety of hair dyes and on all box's it will show how the colour will turn out, it will have grey hair in writing underneath and there are some brands which specialise in grey hair...|`|YB63U3Pgaa	you wouldn't need to stip grey hair, stripping hair is bascially getting rid of colour....... natural colour or chemical coloured. There is no pigmentation in grey hair there for no need to strip it. Sometimes you would soften grey hair so that when you apply the colour ( going darker and usually when there is a lot of grey) it will take better and have a better over all colour. To soften grey hair is a low peroxide mixed with warm water and applied to the hair. Since you want to go lighter then yes you can just apply bleach.|`|TAgAnfIbaa	yea try any beauty supply stores like Sally's if you have one where you live.they sell kits you can use to get that rockstar look.but be careful with bleach it could damage your scalp or turn your hair bright orange.|`|wNZ95AK3aa	yes you can|`|4e01ea3c043d72bb0dcd6600971480b9aa	grey/white/silver are trendy at present so any of those colours are great|`|JkJ551iXaa	yup bleach it or get a blond boxed dye|`|ZMWjdKfraa	You would have to get the grey stripped then a tint put on ,  but its not good for your hair.<br>  edit <br>  If your hair is dark grey it means you still have some pigment left in your hair .If your hair is white or silver it means you have little or no pigment left in hair.

I chose it because my theme is the devil's garden so it kinda represents the darkness of the devil.  I'm doing one arm with a good/heavenly theme and then my arm that I've started is the bad/hell theme because we all have both in us, I suppose at this point in time I just represent a bit more of the bad side on my body right now, but that's because I haven't figured out which artist I want to do the other side and I hate starting new projects with unfinished ones.  I love colorful pieces and the skull and bones that I have will ultimately end up a very girly piece because there are flowers all through it too to be able to balance it out.  It probably won't be my last "skull" piece either because I do love sugar skulls as well.  I love what they represent and the fact that they are highly colorful pieces that are very cool when customized.|`|2A7zqTX9aa	People get tattoos for different reasons.  Sometimes you may see a tattoo and think that it symbolizes something "demonic" but it might have a completely different meaning to the wearer.  Things also aren't always what they seem.  For example: A "sugar skull" represents Mexico's "day of the dead" (el dia de los muertos) which is a holiday celebrating one's ancestors.  BUT if you saw a sugar skull on someone's arm roaming the streets...you might view it as demonic, true?|`|AA11632061	Hay, Its a cool question. Any way I don't have any skull or spider tattoo`s. I just have wing tattoo on my legs.<br>  One day a older person told me, this:<br>  -People who have no way to express them self in society on a normal way they are putting a mark on them to show the society who they really are...(Because tattoo/d people are just cool) that's what he told me!<br>  -But in my point of view, tattoo is just personal thing that you do! I respect tattoo as art, but tattoos all over the body is just to much. But I don't judge people like that...because that is what they like and I respect that.<br>  About the skull thing, I can understand some bikers to have this tattoo but girls, who have no idea about what is going and what a skull tattoo is (not that I know, but I don't have a tattoo like this).<br>  There is no history about this kind of tattoos but people did it mostly because people just think is cool!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|No7SLiRfaa	im only 16 and i cant get tattoos yet but i have known what i wanted for years. <br>  I want a tattoo that matches the one that my dad has or one similar to it. it is a skull that is smoking and wearing this mobster looking hat. My dad loves Oingo boingo and so do i and that is where he got the idea for his tattoo. I just really want something that we can share together like. Or maybe he will get another one with me, that would be awesome. <br>  The other one that im sure that i want to get is a flying fish. my grandpa died when i was ten but he always loved fishing. I want to get a really like abstract looking one. i want a bass or a trout looking fish with dove wings. i hope that makes sense...My grandpa was always talking about this fish that got away because it was so big that it broke his fishing line so im concidering writing the one that got away around it.<br>  I love tattoos and im sure that i will get more than just these two. But to answer your first question about skulls and stuff im not sure but i have always loved creepy things. like skulls and gargoyles..you know stuff like that. i have no idea why but they make me happy and i think that they are awesome. I know this sounds weird but they remind me of my childhood. i have listened to Oingo boingo since before i can remember and i love going to Dia De Los Muertos celebrations. So skulls dont always have to mean death they could just remind you of the past.|`|OXOHoISraa	I have several sugar skull tattoos. I have always been kind of enamoured with Dia De Los Muetros and like that it has a lot to do with ancestors.  I am not hispanic at all (actually lebanese) but I like that a symbol which seems macabre and morbid in our culture is used to celebrate life and ancestry in another culture.  Also, I just like that they are colorful. They kind of remind me that not everyone has the same perceptions in life.  Also, I like that they can be worked in with a lot of more traditional stuff, which I am into.|`|UYnMFfglaa	i have ideas for every singal tattoo im gonna get and im still in high school! my dad doesnt like it and i have to move out before i get any but i was planning to do that anyway! i need ink! im planing on being a tattoo artist because i love it and need the employee discount! im planning on getting a memorial tattoo for my cool awesome uncle mark, who died when some cops cornerd him and he took his life. he was on the run for a while and they lied on the news.

He is covered in them and has a wide variety of styles and images ranging from Chinese lettering to skulls. I was a bit scared at first but he talked me into it and I chose to have my son’s name written in Korean on my back. I went with Korean because I was going to a military school with a Korean linguist and I knew it would say what I wanted it to say (as opposed to picking something out of a tattoo shop that is supposed to say something). It didn’t hurt that bad at all and I decided to get another one. My second one I decided to pick out a flash at the shop and went with a cool piece that had a sun/moon/star thing going (I love Ozzy/Black Sabbath and Sabbath has a song with a line about the sun, moon, and stars – you know it if you’re a real fan) and placed that in the tramp stamp area of my lower back. Then running with my love for Ozzy I got one of his stick man guys (the one with the straight jacket) on the calf of my right leg. I have many ideas and want to get more tattoos. I think once you get one you can’t stop.<br>  <br>  I guess people get tattoos as a way to express themselves – it’s an extension of their personality. Some people hang art on their walls and others have it put directly on their bodies.
fIxCRpVFaa	prolly. that sounds better than bleaching your ends and having them come out different, or lighter|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	XXL live blonde doesn't turn your hair from dark brown to light brown it will make your hair go blonde or possibly orange I use to use this on my medium brown hair as a pre lightener to turn it blonde when I was in my blonde hair phase.<br>  <br>  Just go around superdrug, boots and look for the kind of shade you want then match it up to the colour chart provided this gives a rough guide to what colour your hair may go.  Don't pick up a blonde dye to make it go light brown it will not tun out properly!|`|BZbqr9Pyaa	check on the box all the ones iv seen have a chart on the side of the box of how the colour will come out on different hair colours. if u want it to come out light brown and not dark blonde be careful not to get a blonde thats too light|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Ask your hairdresser, am sure that this term is referred to as "tipping".
5ZK9VGPCaa	I used it and it made my hair feel very clean but it basically stripped it of all it's natural oils. It's very strong. I'd use shampoos from the Aussie brand... it smells amazing and it comparatively gentle to your hair. John Frieda is good too, it's known mostly for the Blonde range, but they make one for Brunettes too now (and Red heads, I think). The fact of the matter is that all "cheap" (drugstore) shampoos contain lots of sodium lauryl sulfate. There are better ones which don't and are better for your hair..like Kerastase and Frederic Fekkai.. but they are three times the price. I buy these because I really take care of my hair and I'd rather buy good shampoos than any styling products or straighteners and things like that, but it depends on you, how much you want to pay. x
AA10626727	do you have an old concert t-shirt? buy or borrow one from the 80's, like Van Halen or a group u may like.....thats about the extent I would dress up. people should think that looks cool without overdoing it with fake mullets and whatever!|`|MJU2FkxYaa	Just wear jeans and a tight t-shirt or button down top. Then no one can really tell whether you came in your normal clothes or dressed up. These are things which were popular then and are popular now. If you want to look like you're from the 80's just add some accessories. <br>  <br>  If the rest of your family aren't dressing up then going with something ambiguous is probably the go. That way you don't look out of place either way.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	I"m not a huge fan of dressing up....if my parents weren't I probably wouldn't.

It looks old fashioned and gaudy. so does the colour-there's something wrong with that shade of green. It needs to be either brighter or darker. that silver border lacey thing is not doing the dress any favours. Cut is also very old fashioned.

BOuPi3wDaa	Wearing a corset on occasion is one thing, but it's not good to wear them very often.  Your ribs are the size they are because they are protecting your organs.  A long time ago women wore corsets all the time, and they were very unhealthy.  That's why they've become less common.  It may permanently squeeze in your ribs, but that's definitely not healthy.  I don't think you should worry about your ribs.  Look around, a lot of girls probably have the same thing and you just never noticed.  I know mine stick out, but I guess I've just never been bothered by it and you shouldn't let it bother you either.|`|283tO9j9aa	It could, if you tightlaced every single day for years. That's a really bad idea though. It would be really uncomfortable and it could mess up your organs. Plus it could hurt. Wearing a corset for special occasions won't do you any harm at all though.<br>  <br>  My ribs stick out a little bit but I just learned to accept my body. Funny ribs is not a big deal when you think about it- I bet nobody even notices. The only people who have noticed mine are a couple of boyfriends.<br>  <br>  Corsets are pretty and they look great but please don't hurt yourself.|`|0iAGnjFvaa	youd have to start a young age when your bones are still soft and developing, and you'd have to wear it every single day, but they are very uncomfortable and you can squish your organs making it very dangerous for your health <br>  <br>  i know some people whose lower ribs stick out in the front, it's perfectly normal, it just means your rib cage fans out a little more than usual, theres no reason to try to hide it! i always thought they looked kind of neat... <br>  <br>  you could always gain a little bit of weight to camouflage the ribs, the thinner you are, the more noticeable they are, to eat a cheeseburger <br>  <br>  good luck =D|`|Cjv4L3Reaa	wtf u on bwt?
jbG4IQW3aa	Let me be the first to tell you. Shyness is something that doesnt go away on its own. If you don't take the initiative yourself to overcome it, you'll be shy and timid all your life. Just get out there and talk to guys, and you'll be amazed at how many will admit to you, "I was waiting for you to say something first". What's the worst that could happen? Some jerk call you a bad name? Well, if you meet someone like that, you should be thankful he's showing his true colors up front, then snap your fingers in his face, and walk away with confidence. I'm not really the one to ask for fashion advice. I know what I like when I see it, but don't know how to put it together. lol You know what I mean? Anyway, be yourself, dress and accessorise yourself to suit yourself, and go conquer the day!<br>  <br>  Hubb|`|cHaLRyrmaa	The eyeliner looks really good on you. I'd prefer eyeliner over any other makeup any day, and men are usually attracted to somewhat darker-toned eyes.

(:<br>  <br>  first of all, i think you're beautiful as you are.  you have amazing eyes & beautiful skin.  BUT, since you said you want to go for something different, here's what i'd suggest.<br>  <br>  HAIR:<br>  maybe lighten it up a little bit?  still stay on the darker shades; maybe a medium brown would look good on you.  do you ever try curling it?  depending on the length of your hair (shoulder length and longer would look best), i'd try curling it.  <br>  <br>  EYES:<br>  your eyes are stunning, period.  eyeliner looks good on you though, but if you don't wanna go for a dark liner look like that all the time, try a brown liner.  & brown/golden eyeshadows.  those are the best colors for blue eyes.  play it up a little bit & don't be afraid of mascara.  mascara is a girl's bestfriend.<br>  <br>  and as far as clothing goes, do you have any pictures of what you wear now?  what's your usual style?<br>  <br>  hope i helped some!  <3|`|283tO9j9aa	I thought the eyeliner looked nice actually, and you look just fine as you are. Maybe try experimenting with your makeup a bit- bright eyeshadow or something.<br>  <br>  I think your hair would look good if you dyed it dark red- if you're allowed to do that of course.<br>  <br>  If you don't know what to wear, think about your body shape and famous people who have a similar shape. Look at what they wear, and see if you like it. Don't forget to look at pictures of people from the past like Audrey Hepburn and Marilyn Monroe as well as people who are around now. Ultimately it's not what you wear but how you wear it- someone could be dressed head to toe in designer cl0othes and look awful if the clothes don't suit their shape and don't go well together.|`|0Pf6yvhwaa	you dont really need to do anything, i think your pretty just the way you are.|`|cw2qwk9Uaa	That's exactly it,ur 14.Experiment,find urself,no one else can tell you that!If you really don't know,keep it simple.A white T and jeans with cute accessories always works,is effortless and cute.|`|XOqJoyuYaa	lose the eyeliner for gods sake that looks terrible<br>  and i cant see what you wear but dont dress like a skank|`|btDUzW6caa	ummm...you look perfectly fine to me...Im 19, so hopefully this isnt too creepy ;)<br>  i was going to say soemting about the eye makeup, but i guess thats what eyeliner is lol<br>  <br>  i dunno...you have pretty eyes...maybe you shuold get clothes that bring those out? i dont know what those would be lol...like blue shirts?<br>  i dunno<br>  <br>  grow your hair out some more, and get it layered and like kinda longish...maybe some autumn highlights (redlights?)<br>  <br>  you look ok tho :/<br>  <br>  landon|`|tiEUVhMKaa	actually u are young for ur age and u should just wear the clothes that are u because everyone has theyer own style but then again if u want to change ur apperence get a nice tan, go to hollister or rave, dont wear too much eyeliner though because that just make u look like a racoon trust me i kno people around here where i am over do it, also sweet heart u don't need to think about those guys , because in ur  later teen age years u mite get a bf and he mite be everything u think he is but he isnt dont try to dress to impress guys if t\ur changing ur apperence do it for u most guys in theyer teenage years are imature and have demistic minds and if u wana dress for a guys attention they like exposer if u do happen to make ur appernce sexy dont do it for those guys because a guy see a girl expoising herself they going to think u easy

4ZzLtY9Saa	spend ￡15 and go down to your hairdressers it is a special occasion after all! do you really want to be in photos with frizzy hair?|`|4kk0HaAZaa	Getting curly hair without frizz is always the challenge.  That's because curly hair, with its uneven cuticule (that's the outer layer of hair) can get frizzier easier than straight hair, as the uneven cuticle allows moisture to enter the hair more readily.<br>  <br>  So, what to do to solve the problem?  You definitely need to use a conditioner that adds the right amount of moisture to your curls to keep them smooth.  Scrunching your hair is a good idea, with some kind of styling product that will help your curls hold.  Then, don't brush and don't blow dry without a diffuser!<br>  <br>  If you are looking for some good styles and tips on how to get them, you can check out Daily Makeover.  We have loads of celebrity looks that you can virtually try on by uploading a photo of yourself.  We also review products and you can try on makeup and accessories.  It's fun!

OneqqWZ5aa	Hey!<br>  Well, if may be due to the fact that the straightener, may burn your hair slightly making it smell then when you wash it.<br>  P.S If you straighten your hair too much, like every single day, it can tend to fall out!<br>  <br>  I learnt the hard way lol.<br>  hope this helps.|`|YQxxVdLNaa	It's because of the relaxer in the straightener to keep your hair straight. After you use the straightener, it smells like some thing's burning. When you wash you hair, it combines the smell of the relaxer and the water and that's why you smell wet dog. Next time, wash your hair first, comb through it with a brush or comb, let it air dry (or blow dry if you must), then straighten it. Hope I hepled.|`|FfF86e1maa	That's a shame, I think you need to switch up your shampoo and conditioner! :)|`|IFGSOd16aa	You said i was rude,<br>  <br>  so YOU ARE A DOG!<br>  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>  <br>  (just giving you a hard time :) )|`|AA11893861	Your hair is fried and needs repaired . The smell is the relaxer , your hair can't hold all the chemicals you're putting into it . I suggest you get a good cut . and leave you hair alone for a good long time .

AA11893861	hair breakage is cause because of over lapping the relaxer on previously relaxed hair . DON"T go over the line of demarcation . That means do the roots up to the start of the previously relaxed hair . . Wash your hair gently in cool , not HOT water .Comb your hair out gently starting at the nape of the neck and working your way up. Get the ends trimmed too . Don't flat iron it for at least 24 to 72 hours . And make sure you use a good oil on your hair to protect it from the heat . Also a good hot oil treatment under a hair dryer , would do wonders for the shine , texture and growth .. <br>  Good Luck|`|GqVaHA7Iaa	The not flat ironing before or after is ridiculous, if she were in the salon and didn't have time for a roller set they would curl her with heat.<br>  Overlapping the relaxer can cause breakage, so if you know you're a sloppy applicator you can buy a product called porosity control at sally's, small bottle $2 will get you thru 3-4 retouches. You put on your hair everywhere except the new growth to protect it from the perm.  The cheapo method would be using a little of your own conditioner the same way. <br>  After the relaxer a lot of brands and stylist now condition the hair before neutralizing while the hair folicles are open to add nutrients, but if you're just going by what the box instructs, that is fine.<br>  Neutralize, then a moisturizing shampoo (the kit probably does not have that)<br>  The the deep conditioner or reconstructor is best if one does not come in the kit.<br>  You can blow out and flat iron your hair that day, but too much heat will cause breakage.|`|kqMl0xPAaa	just last week i used the same brand <br>  it works really well but dont put the oil, put vaseline or any petroleum base around your edges and dont put the perm on you edges until you finish the rest because if you do the sides of your hair will break <br>  and dont flat iron you hair before you put the perm in.<br>  <br>  Hope it works....|`|jtbDrlbMaa	If you realx your own hair do not put it on the scalp only on the roots, or new growth only. I used to perm my hair and blow dry it, then flat iron it for a silky finish. Just dont flat iron your hair EVERYDAY while you have a relaxer, major damage!|`|7bf7fbd4987902f29965a776571e4aaaaa	First, you should use the mildest relaxer that will give you the best results.  I use a children's regular and I get great results, but it depends on your hair type. Also, don't leave the chemicals in your hair too long. If you need a haircut or a trim, do this before you relax your hair if possible.<br>  To prevent breakage, there are a few things you should do faithfully. Use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and always use a leave-in conditioner. Do a deep conditioning treatment once a week. You can use heat on your hair, but you should always use a heat protectant before. If you use curling irons or straightener (flat iron) it should have a temperature control. With relaxed hair you can style your hair using a lower heat setting. There are so many goo|`|Vm9JQ6zSaa	Make sure that you grease your scalp really well before you relax your hair. I use DOOGro hair grease & scalp oil & it really does help your hair to grow. But definitely oil your scalp before you relax your hair. And try to grease your scalp every other day.Tying your hair up @ night with a silk scarf also helps. Dont put your hair completely up after just getting a relaxer. Wait at least a week or so you wont put strain on your hair & scalp.

rWsUjaiVaa	if the wings are relatively large, then id say to get one on each shoulder blade. otherwise, have it centered between or slightly above your shoulder blades. to have both on one shoulder would look a bit ridiculous. also, id suggest getting the quote or text centered above the wings. that would be really beautiful. best wishes!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	If the wings are over 5" ish in length then I would say one on each. If they're smaller, personally I'd have them close together but between my shoulder blades so they're still central. I think they'd look a bit odd on one shoulder blade. But then I have an obsessive compulsive need for symmetry haha so if you're happy with the shoulder blade then go for it! But I'd definitely say whichever you choose is size dependant.|`|HeBFxZVCaa	<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_byZz8NXtv1Q/R-t0TMR1oAI/AAAAAAAAAA4/bILIgagwuFg/S660/angel_wings_tattoo_by_cannibol.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_byZz8NXtv1Q/R-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/o/r/kane112104b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/o/r/kane...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/X/s/121804f1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/X/s/1218...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.angelwingstattoo.net/images/fake-wings-tattoo.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelwingstattoo.net/images/f...</a><br>  <br>  thers a few pics i love wings on both sides  and i think you can most differently incorporate words into it you just have to find the right style of wing first|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	Personally if you're going for wings I'd go for one on each shoulder blade so it's anatomically correct - as much as an angel can be!<br>  <br>  Are you talking the whole of your back? I say the bigger the better. if you go to a decent artist then I shouldn't see any problem with incorporating words - perhaps along the tips of the wings. If you're going for all black with shading then perhaps black writing done in a caligraphy style would look nice either between the wings at the top or bottom...<br>  <br>  Sounds like a good choice :)|`|TDtSZLmvaa	I like both of those, just depending on size, if you are getting one on each shoulder blade, to me, they only look good if they are big enough to stretch all the way down your back to where the bottom tip of the wing is on the top part of your butt. If you dont like them that big, i would get the two on one shoulder but kinda medium smallish size.<br>  <br>  depends on what kind of words and where at... but yeah you should be able to.<br>  <br>  good luck =]|`|TZO2jhzFaa	It depends how big the wings are...

Since blonde hair is extremely porous, you just need a dark dye that you can buy at a cvs or something.  Then all you do is follow the directions and completely saturate your hair with it, and there's no mistakes that can be made.  <br>  As for telling your mom, just explain to her that you don't want to live with that color hair and that it just doesn't suit you.|`|eL9NkNZ5aa	I'm 14 too!! <br>  <br>  Buy the dye from a good quality shop, and I suggest that you wait for a while like a month or something before you dye it.. because the dye might ruin your hair eg. split ends and hair fall. <br>  <br>  Good luck! =)
zon13nY2aa	Use a volumising spray when your hair is wet.<br>  <br>  And the key is blow drying it right. Use a vented brush and blow dry the hair from side to side (my hairdresser does this on my side fringe) for several minutes, then sweep it to the side where you want it.<br>  <br>  Secure in place with hairspray.<br>  <br>  If it's not sitting right then it will never look right, so I guess the key is having it cut to sit in the right place. xx

Before my wife & I married, there was another girl I saw sometimes. She was not just a "Tomboy", she was a "Thomasboy", and everyone knew it. She liked to play football with the guys, go fishing; just all the stuff guys normally do. And she couldn't help it, she had two very tough older brothers, and a very strict dad. Nevertheless, she still had those undeniable "girlish" qualities about her that inevetibly attracted some of the guys who knew her pretty well, one of which was yours truly. My then girlfriend (now wife), was far too delicate to play football, or go fishing, or anything that might tarnish her "lady-like" reputation, and I loved that about her. And still do. But when those hormones hit and we wanted to start "he-ing & she-ing", my Tomboy was always ready. Didn't matter what the weather was, nor what either of us was doing, we could meet at the drop of a hat. That was convenient for both of us. But when it came time to get married, who do you suppose I chose? The one who was the most "girly" as you put it. My best girl would always let me open doors for her, pay for meals, lift heavy things, etc.,etc. She did a lot of things just to boost my fragile male ego. I realize that now. But it's been those things that have made me fall deeper in love with her every day. How can you act more girly? I don't know if you are a Tomboy or not, like my friend, but if you are, my best advice to you is to forget everything you know, and start acting like the cute, "snobby" girls in your school act. (Snobby attitude excepted) A guy wants a girl who is pettite, frail, and almost helpless, so he can be her hero, and knight in shinning armour.<br>  <br>  Hubb|`|BVkQzUBZaa	Wear girly colours more.

AA11554123	Well, acting mature sure helps, but other than that, just wear what you normally wear. If the guy notices your dramatic change in style, he might think you're obsessed with him. Just be yourself, that is the best tool of the trade: originality. Hope this helps! :)|`|dxuCoW8Aaa	Now this might come as a shock, but guys don't really pay all that much attention to what women wear.

If he asked you on a date he most likely has no problems with your wardrobe right now.|`|Moe5zGO7aa	Hmm how about a pair of jeans, boots, and a cute sweater. Make up you should keep it minimal because tons of make up can convey u are trying to look older. With your hair it doesnt matter really.

9D6Y4dYuaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  You're right...there are tons of products on the market today and it can become extremely frustrating when trying to find the right one. And although I can't recommend one in particular, I can give you some advice on the subject. <br>  <br>  My best suggestion is to sample a handful of different products and see which one you like the most. This way you can save money while still testing the products on your skin. This is the best way to find out if you have any allergies to a certain product or not. Here are a few lotions that I got s free samples. The process takes a bit longer than I would like, but hey—it's free! Hope this helps and good luck! Send me an e-mail if you want to discuss products further, or if you find anything worth trying. <br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|3f75d47d5a6246cc0cedf5b9350c29abaa	I've never used it,but when i worked at Ulta alot of the customers LOVED it,and said it worked.Also are skin lady there said it was really good...Good Luck!

oVxr5B3Eaa	Ah, make sure there are no crusties on the ring. I know sometimes if they're are and you turn the ring, and the crusties go on the inside they can be sharp and it hurts. <br>  Also, what material is the ring? Sounds like it might be an allergy. This is what it felt like when I was allergic to my nipple rings so i switched just one to gold for a month to see what the difference would be and the gold one healed up waaaaayyy better and feels fine now. <br>  <br>  Gold is the best material for healing so try to find an internally threaded (or cbr) gold ring (or white gold) and it should help...<br>  <br>  But thats what a metal allergy felt like for me. <br>  <br>  And try not to turn it when it's dry. It could be catching on the healing skin inside the hole and ripping it. It needs some sort of lubrication.|`|TeEcR3kcaa	you really should talk to the person that did the piercing with any concerns you have, they will know whats part of the healing and what could be or lead to infection.|`|wSXI64Q7aa	you should see your doctor|`|jeX5VZAtaa	If it still hurts yes...why dont you put a straight bar through it instead of a ring???????

XrcZkt6Haa	Rub the pearls lightly along the biting edge of your upper front teeth. If they feel slightly rough, sandy or gritty, it's likely they are cultured or natural pearls because of the layers of nacre that have formed over time. If they feel smooth or glassy, they are probably imitations. That's because the imitations are made by dipping a plastic or glass bead into some sort of paint, sometimes including iridescent fish scales. You will also get the same result (rough, sandy, or gritty) if two pearls are rubbing together.<br>  <br>  here is more methods to to tell real and fake pearls, <a href="http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=genuine-or-fake-cultured-pearls-article-25" rel="nofollow">http://www.pearlhours.com/index.php?url=...</a>|`|3LvlXDOAaa	put it in vinegar!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ( don't actually cause a real one would dissolve lol)|`|AA10119874	The real pearl will feel like it's dragging on your teeth.|`|AA10063059	you scrape it with your teeth if it marks its fake

SFT3s2dlaa	NEVER match ur eyeshadow to your outfit. Too matchy-matchy.<br>  <br>  Silver and white means u can wear any colour so punch it up a notch and go with a really bright turqouise colour.

I would goto a stylist before hand though and see what they recommend.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	As the other persom said, without using bleach the only way is to leave it grow out.

This is a little hard on the hair but a good trained professional could it and then condition it. Then wait a week or two and get her to go a step lighter....Trying dark brown over it just cost you wasted money.|`|Rw17sVWnaa	what i did MAY or may not damage ur hair. it depends on the current condition of your hair. my hair has been dyed black for about 3 months and i soon became bored of it. it was so dull. i tried to lighten it with colorsilk light brown b/c it's ammonia-free! i used it on my entire head, but avoided the roots! the last thing u want is lighter roots! it DID lighten my hair... but only slightly! a few weeks later i bought garnier colorbreaks for color-treated hair in a caramel color. i used it on about 10 to 15 thin strands of hair. it put light brown, slightly orange high lights in my hair. NOBODY wants that orange look, SO i did a double process in the same day and dyed my entire head AGAIN with the colorsilk light brown. this left my black hair a bit lighter, and took most of the orange out of my streaks. my hair is now a very dark brown with light brown streaks. my hair is still healthy and pretty =) altogether i spent about $15.00 =) if u dont trust yourself, go to a SALON! but it will cost u around $60-$90. hope this helped!|`|EaSEjCMZaa	You can keep washing your hair and after a couple weeks you could buy the shade of brown you want.

Lise Watier is one. After speaking with my cosmetician she suggested Revlon long wearing eye shadows, which come in four to a palette. A way to make any eye wear last longer is to use your foundation or your concealer on the eye first and then powder it next, and add your long lasting colour. Remember a light touch of concealer and foundation then pat with long lasting translucent powder...... It is a cheaper alternative and I have had both my teens done that way and when they have some home from the dance it's still in place.....|`|dhnxlxzjaa	you can get eyeprimers at a drug store like you can get nyx jumbo eyeshadow pencils as a base and use concealer as your eye primer hope this helped =D

5v5pyjfGaa	Same here, I'm a size 7 through 9, depends really on the brands. 138lbs., '5"10, I'm not the most best of shape ever, some brands are looser than others, so just try different brands. If you feel self-conscious, then get one size bigger, and shrink them, wear them around the house for a little while so they stretch out a little and aren't "crazy tight". It's what I do, it works great for me and my friends. I was too, unsure if I should get them, worried about if I'd look fat in them, but no, my  friends said I looked really good in them. So they should for you to, since we're the same size!

Now of course when you get out your going straight to the mirror to squeeze that zit! Take your cloth out with you, don't let any cold air touch your face(this will cause your pores to close) and don't squeeze directly on the head of your pimple, more towards the pimple on both ends(where your fingers are not on the pimple at all but slightly pushing things out) if you feel pain run hot/warm water in the palm of you hand and cuff it over (with water in still in hand) your pimple and let sit there until it loses it's warmth. You want to repeat these steps until you squeezed out as much as you could, when your done keep placing the warm cloth on your face to stop swelling and( I don't know if your familiar with A&D ointment) but before you go to sleep rub on A&D ointment and that should stop bruising.|`|a24ef19d34a8e1a074ec6b3f3983a7e6aa	Wash the area surrounding it after squeezing to prevent it from spreading. Use Neosporin afterwards to help it heal and Mederma or cocoa butter to get rid of any marks or scars. Good luck!|`|jX7Bt0iBaa	If it has a cap on it, after you get out of the shower squeeze the pimple with your fingertip approx. a little under a quarter of an inch distance between your finger tip and the pimple.

After you shower or wash your face is best because your pores are open, push from below the pimple very gently, if it does not want to open let it be and try later.

ARSnCRLbaa	Long term, you'd do more harm than good...you can get problems like hammertoes and bunions, as well as some nerve and tendon problems because you're putting more pressure on the balls of your feet.  If you're planning to wear them all the time, switch to the cute ballet flats from time to time.  Wedge heels aren't as bad on your feet compared to high heels (like stilettos) because your feet aren't so arched in them, which means less pressure on your feet and tendons.  <br>  The benefits of wearing heels, obviously are that they give you height and they make your calves look skinnier, so if the shoes are cute and comfy, go for it!!|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	There are no benefits physically speaking for wearing heels. The angle is bad for your back, ankles and if you wear heels for a long period of time, never changing into flats during the week for example, your feet can change shape making you going back to flats uncomfortable. this is what happens to a lot of girls who are stucked having to wear heels constantly because their feet changed shape. So i suggest you switch from time to time. Wearing heels all week long can make people have a not so positive idea of you too but then that's another story|`|1ioI2py4aa	make you look taller<br>  erm... makes you walk with a better posture somethimes<br>  make you feel good|`|IKrTilqiaa	Heels make your legs look longer and thinner, but that's pretty obvious.<br>  <br>  It's good to vary wearing heels and flats because it stretches the muscley things (or something) on the bottom of your feet. <br>  <br>  Obviously, wearing heels can sometimes hurt your feet because of the pressure points. And it's also much harder to run away from scary people in heels|`|vCbM6yJfaa	taller<br>  shapely legs<br>  thinner legs<br>  <br>  downs-<br>  bad posture (it pushes your **** back and boobs forward)<br>  painfull feet|`|cd4bc6835c8cbe320baeec2d02112f80aa	well, it makes ur legs look longer when u wear heels. it makes u taller (duh, sorry), and it stretches ur calves in an (i think) attractive way. the downs are that they make ur feet sore. :P|`|n9HUANkiaa	the only benefit i know of is you look so damn sexy in them!
cMZEmpp0aa	...I really think a kimono is a terrible choice for prom. If you actually wear it right (which you should, since that would be the respectful thing to do) you're going to find it kind of hard to dance and run around, and if you spill something on it chances are very high that the outfit will be totally ruined. Even if you have access to a professional kimono cleaner, there are some stains that just don't come out. Not to mention that buying the entire kimono ensemble is going to be very expensive. Look at everything you would need to wear it properly:<br>  <br>  - The kimono itself, which should probably be a furisode or houmongi to be formal enough for prom<br>  - An obi, which should definitely be a fukuro obi (or possibly a maru obi) to be formal enough for prom<br>  - An appropriate obi age<br>  - An appropriate obi jime<br>  - A juban<br>  - A minimum of four himo (ties, usually made of something non-slippery like muslin) or a good substitute (and tie or elastic band will do, but make sure you don't use anything that could catch on the kimono fabric)<br>  - A date jime or substitute (ace bandages work well for this)<br>  - An obi makura<br>  - A pair of tabi<br>  - A pair of zori (and I do highly recommend that you wear the proper footwear, because Western footwear just looks ridiculous with kimono)<br>  <br>  You'll probably also want to look into a matching handbag (these often come in sets with zori), some kind of shawl or stole if the weather is going to be cold (no, a Western-style coat will not work, it will just wrinkle your kimono sleeves), and appropriate hair accessories.<br>  <br>  If you're still totally set on getting a kimono, I suggest you look on places like Ichiroya, Yamatoku, Kimono Lily, and Ryu Japan. I also suggest you stop by the Immortal Geisha forums and read some of the info in the Kitsuke threads, particularly in the Kimono and Kitsuke Knowledge Bank. If you're going to do this, you might as well learn the rules for wearing kimono and putting kimono outfits together well.|`|AA10803040	You should sew one yourself, if you know how, but if not, check eBay and specialty websites.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you live near China Town (in CA or NY), you can find great kimono look alikes, along with great accessories.|`|rxepaX6Iaa	you can buy kimono dresses online at...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fs%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref%255F%3Dnb%255Fss%255Fa%26field-keywords%3Dkimono%26url%3Dsearch-alias%253Dapparel&tag=yahanswer-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a>|`|6uYVRaebaa	ok? do you wanna know where or...? <br>  ebaaay
AA11340418	No it is not the blow dryer, there are special products you can purchase in a salon or over the counter that are made especially for blow drying hair, but it is the way you blow-dry and the attachments you use and also the brush you use, a defuser works well, and they attach to the end of theblow-dryerr, and use a round styling brush then you can touch it up with a curling iron.  There are also beauty Supply stores that are open to the public and most of the girls there are licensed stylist,|`|ERjGLJaEaa	They have these ion blow dryers that have a button you can turn on that is supposed to take the frizz out of your hair. I have one and it seems to work. Maybe try buying a stylists blowdryer at like Sally Beauty Supply store. They are more expensive, but they are great and they dry your hair fast. Also have you tried a straightening iron? This gets the flyaways to straighten and also frizziness too.

UojyaVglaa	i love the mane and tail products. just get their regular line. you can get it at sally's. however, it wont make your hair grow any faster. try taking a prenatal vitamin supplement as well. it will help get your hair nice and healthy, and it does wonders for your nails too.|`|qG70SHCDaa	I just bought the conditoner today at a local Wal-Mart. It's in the pet department. You can use it as a leave in conditoner as I do or wash it out. The leave in for me keeps my hair from being dry and frizzy and also keeps it managable. It's a pretty big bottle that will last a while. Only $6.00.|`|8D76XK0Oaa	My friend told me that mane 'n tale works wonders on her hair. She said it helped her scalp heal and it made her hair shiny. You should buy main 'n tale. It's pretty expensive but its an investment.|`|3kkKonRDaa	if you want results! here you go www.hairlogicproducts.com after 6years in the lab. you only get results.|`|xdyM3IVmaa	Mane and Tail shampoo/conditioner is only in a basic line... it's horse hair products, but they sell it for people since it does an amazing job... get the giant bottles at wal mart, or you can go to tractor supply company/etc. and look in the horse section. I personally love the stuff. <br>  <br>  It won't MAKE your hair grow any faster, but it will help improve the overall condition of it... which in turn can make it grow to the best of its ability. Prenatal vitamins can also give it a boost.
ERjGLJaEaa	Your normal hair looks a little washed out and dull. I think the new haircut would look awesome on you and it would have more body and style.

I'm sure you would look great, but even if you dont want highlights, natural colour is always fantastic =)|`|bHcxSUwtaa	go for it! :D because really, your hair is thick by the looks of it, so it'll probly grow fast if you don't like your new hair cut anyway.

With your face short hair would complement ur face nicely!<br>  Considering the last pic isn't u yah short hair would look great on you!

dxuCoW8Aaa	I honestly really think what you wear does affect how you present yourself. I personally feel a lot more confident and out going when I know I look good and like what I'm wearing. <br>  <br>  As for your change of style, it'll just take some time to get used to your new look. Until you become comfortable with it just fake it. Faking confidence usually brings real confidence so keep your head up, shoulders back and walk it out.<br>  <br>  Leighton Meester is my own style icon so I commend you on your taste. :)|`|yP9uPmbKaa	I think style is a personal thing, you cant force yourself to look a certain way...just because someone looks good in something doesn't mean u will.<br>  <br>  Go with your gut and just wear what you feel comfortable in, maybe you can wear skinny jeans and heels, instead of a skirt.|`|qoscLwIqaa	I think you feel uncomfortable because yes, you're not used to it, but also you don't have confirmation that you look good in that style. Wait for someone to say "you look nice in that dress" and you'll feel much more comfortable.<br>  Yes it does make you act in a different way... On days when i don't feel good i wear totally comfy clothes, just jeans, trainers etc, but on a day when i feel sexy i wear nice girly clothes, and act way more confident because of it.<br>  I have a similar problem; when i wear some dresses or girly colours i just think i look ridiculous, but you've just got to think yourself gorgeous in them and it will come off fine.|`|OJWApbmbaa	I think so because when I'm in drab bag clothes I don't feel as good about myslef when I'm wearing make up and I'm all dressed up. So yeah clothing can effect how you percieve yourself.|`|d8EYaNw2aa	well when i wear sweat pants with a sweat shirt i feel lazy and sloppy when i wear stuff that is cheap and doesn't fit i feel itchy and nasty and like ugly when i wear high end designers stuff that fits nice and stuff that i like i feel great my self confident is past the roof and i totally love it!!|`|tIH5XEUhaa	dont let the clothes wear you, you wear the clothes. <br>  i wouldnt try wearing abything your just not comfortable in you should wear stuff that shows off the real you not who you wany to be. <br>  <br>  Becky xXx|`|YGMP9nKBaa	Ok if u wear what u like it will make u feel confident or happier. and if u wear something uncomfortable that is not ur style u might feel akward and act grumpy.|`|hTmbHPsSaa	I think it really does affect you on what you wear and how you act around people <br>  <br>  <X>|`|kAzdk2blaa	Yes you have to feel comfortable in your clothes otherwise you are not going to get the confidence you need but it's about being yourself. you can still look really feminine without wearing skirts or giant heels, just lower the heel right down and perhaps wedges are more to your style. and try wearing skinny jeans or leggings with a skirt on top, this allows you to feel more girly and grandly get used to wearing other types of clothing. It takes a while to sink in that you have change but i think when you know you have gotton used to it is when you step outside the door feeling really good.

When you curl away, hold the hair out to the side of your head with the curling iron straight up and down. Clamp the hair into the iron and roll the iron toward the back of your head.<br>  <br>  Do the same with the last section(top layer).<br>  <br>  These instruction probably seem confusing but try it out. If it feels like the curls on the side of your face are too much, take the amount of hair you'd use for a poof and pin it back with bobby pins.|`|8D76XK0Oaa	Curl from the middle of your hair, down.

zzkmdusEaa	Ink is pricey but it wouldn't be very costly, maybe around the $100 ballpark.<br>  <br>  Also, to be blunt, I would honestly just wait to get a tattoo. Wait until you are 18 where your parents don't have a say in it. You don't want to mark your body for life and not have the blessing of your parents. Think about what you are doing, you just don't seem ready to get a tattoo and if you have to hide it from your mom then you just need to consider waiting until the mature age. Review your ideas and once that day comes when you are old enough, you'll definitely be landed with a unregrettable tattoo.|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	Don't know how you are going to hide it from your parents when it is on your ear. what if you forget it is there and you put the hair behind your ear that has the tat..it will show. Besides starts are way to common.|`|1O1ZyEhpaa	definitely agree with Sara, the stars are HELLA common. A tattoo should be something that signifies apart of you. Not something you saw on a celebrity|`|IkXU06wpaa	u need someone like an uncle or aunt to say its ok u can get a tattoo @ 12 yrz old & if ur parents or guardian say its okay then its okay|`|vZ4NXlBmaa	This exact question gets asked daily<br>  every single part of it. <br>  <br>  You're too young for a tattoo....grow up and wait.<br>  Maybe by the time you're 18+ AND mature enough to permanently mark your body, you'll be able to come up with an idea that isn't done 8,000 times every day across the country<br>  and maybe you'll have enough sense to know that only the artist you'll go to can tell you how much it will cost.<br>  <br>  by then you won't have to hide it from your parents either|`|QcbgIBghaa	it shouldnt be much, the bigger it is, the more $$....there ganna see it eventually, u wanna get 1 like on ur back or something so it be covered by your shirt or w/e...i got a cross on my forarm and i wanted to hide it, i wore long sleeves like everyday, then 1 day i forgot and after a month later they saw it...its best you tell them first, otherwise all hell could break loose lol...but then eventually it die down, took my parents almost 2 yrs to get over it! (got mine when i was 18)|`|xCfHnQBbaa	That sounds cute. I wonder if it would hurt on your ear?  It will probably cost around 50 bucks depending where you go. Are you not of legal age?

It will probably be the shop minimum which ranges from $30 - 100 usually|`|8a46cf985d12bfcd9a6c364a7844b9a6aa	doesn't Rhianna already have that tattoo???|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Keep your hair down. I have a tattoo behind my ear and no one even notices it unless I have my hair up. The stars though are SOOOO common.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	If you keep your hair down your parents won't see it. It will be around  60$ i quote you sixty because that's how much mine was and it was a small butterfly with 3 stars, it has a special meaning behind it by the way. Anyways it also depends on the shop. Good Luck!

tqYpkDyEaa	Yeah, you have to bleach it first.  To go about that just put the bleach on the part of your head that you want to be dyed blue.  After you bleach it dry that part of your hair.  Then, just put the blue dye in.  I would leave the bleach and dye in for about 40-45 minutes each, just to make sure your actually dying it well.<br>  <br>  Tip:  Tin foil is great for dying.  Before you put the bleach in your hair, put tinfoil under that piece of hair, then paint/rub the bleach on your hair.  Fold the tinfoil up once, so it stays in place.  Repeat this for when you're putting the dye in.<br>  <br>  You need to buy bleach and dye and tinfoil.  You can buy bleach and tinfoil at a grocery store.  You can buy the dye from a drugstore, do you have a RiteAid near you?  Or, Hot Topic has some dyes.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|sbh1BM0iaa	You might want to see if you like it first so I'd say buy some of the wash out spray stuff<br>  If you go in New Look they sell it there.<br>  <br>  But yeah, you will need to bleach it blonde if your dying it<br>  Get that done at hairdressers<br>  You can get the blue there if you want<br>  but it's probably easier, when it fades to just buy some blue dye<br>  Stargazer - Coral Blue is a nice colour :)<br>  <br>  Good luck! :D|`|mfVESm0Gaa	i did my hair with red and blue at different times.do not bleach it and spray it. go to the beauty supply shops and buy the product there. fyi i tried blue and it had a hard time taking. they had to do it twice.  i had brown hair at the time|`|G1G9gJj4aa	i definitely agree, go to a hair salon man<br>  they'll hook you up proper :D<br>  i dont really know much about dying hair, but i can sure put up a hawk or liberty spikes....ahhh *reminesces to his younger years* haha<br>  <br>  hey, if everyone could check out my question, i have quite long hair and i want to cut it short but i have no idea how....please help :D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305091403AAR6c1D">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  peace and thanks<br>  ~van|`|boUUnTjnaa	Well You Could go To A Salon and Ask The Hairdresser to Do it Or  if in uk go to superdrug or any shop selling hairdye and buy Schwarzkopf Live Color XXL Then use foil's its easy to do ! good luck|`|tz4MIrF1aa	just leave your hair natural. color on dudes just looks weird...and like you're seeking attention. dont do it dude. dont do it.|`|283tO9j9aa	As your hair is light brown, you probably won't need to bleach your hair unless you want a lighter blue. Bleach does damage your hair so I wouldn't advise doing it at home.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to either go to a salon and get it done or have someone else help you.<br>  <br>  Stargazer, Fudge Paintbox and Manic Panic all have a blue dye. With the Fudge ones, if you want a deeper blue you can mix the blue and purple together. All these dyes are semi-permanent so they will eventually fade if you mess up.|`|i8EMuPJiaa	Go to the local super market or hair shop, they always sell hair dye and it takes about 10 miutes.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	just to do one bit you will need to take the section you want to dye and clip down the rest then apply the dye and seal the section in foils. <br>  you will need some help to do that at home ask someone who dyes their own hair puting your own foils in is very difficult without help.<br>  <br>  you can get blue dye from goth shops and some new look stores have a brand called stargazer. <br>  i have bleached hair and did a blue streak over the top of it. it washed out really quickly so i would just put it on your normal hair colour.|`|MSCWZo2baa	my step moms a beautitian so she did mine professionally for me... my hairs dark brown and we bleached mine to a yellow orange color and then put the blue in....im at school right now but later i can check the brand of hair dye that i use...as long as you get yours done professionally it shouldnt damage your hair unless you go to a cheap place...|`|iRRNMbQKaa	Bleaching first is a must if you want the color to actually show up. Bleaching is pretty easy, but if you have no clue what you're doing, GO TO A HAIR SALON. Bleaching at a salon costs about $30 give or take unless you go to an upscale salon where bleaching will cost $90 and up. Sally Beauty Supply is a great place to get hair colors (Manic Panic, and   Beyond The Zone: Color Jamz are my favorites). <br>  <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallybeauty.com/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YFeznXFOaa	you should go to a hair salon to make sure it gets done right

But definitely depends on your skin tone! I think if you have a darker skin tone, teal might NOT be the best. But if you have a lighter skin tone teal will look great, especially if you have light colored eyes, like hazel, light brown, green, or blue. It will really bring that out.<br>  So, teal for light skin.<br>  And purple should look great with either ;D|`|esXrerTPaa	im thinking the teal. although i like the purple color better, the teal is more happy and spring/summery.congradulate your aunt for me!|`|XDNS53mhaa	I think that you should go with a light spring color pink and wear you're hair up in a twist and wear black high heels.

PbEs5z1Kaa	i'd say yeah, the term exotic is synonymous with at least one dark feature being present. i don't think i would ever call a playboy model (blonde hair, blue eyes, white girl) exotic.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Exotic is a characteristic of another place or part of the world.....I don't think they necessarily have to have a dark feature...just be out of the ordinary. Unusual.|`|FBQOBhqIaa	When I use exotic I mean by there dark, bold, beautiful features they have;)|`|3Z4YFz29aa	yes, because most Europeans are NOT dark, so dark is exotic.<br>  <br>  I bet in Asia, it is NOT considered exotic because it's the norm, but it is not the norm in a euro-centered culture|`|bca7Yds1aa	ha ha to the dude underneath that is so incorrect... Exotic just means alien, strange, unique... so you could be freaking ginger with purple eyes and 15 fingers and be exotic... to be a girl and be called exotic its a mixture of sexy, sassy, mysterious and flirty, but depends on different peoples opinions i suppose x

uHb3q2fdaa	You have to be in shape, so if your thighs are horrible and flabby then they probably won't look good. But if they are in proportion with the rest of your body you'll look fine.<br>  If I'm honest, skinny jeans don't look good if you have big hips a lot of the time - they make them look wider. But that is easily resolved by wearing a tunic-top or a dress-top that comes down to mid-thigh. That looks best.|`|dxuCoW8Aaa	Sounds to me like your friends are snobby little prats. <br>  Skinny jeans are one way to play up a womans natural curves if they're worn correctly. Granted, it does look terrible when real, natural women squeeze themselves into anything that doesn't fit correctly.Skinny jeans look better on some heavier women then a flared leg would be and so on. Don't be worried about wearing skinny jeans, be worried about wearing clothes that don't fit you.|`|BJdTpw97aa	No, you don't have to be skinny. I see many females with curves who look nice in skinny jeans. Mind you, they are the right fit and don't have muffin tops and such. It depends. <br>  <br>  You can wear anything as long as you have confidence and the right size.|`|FdHRzbFAaa	Your size is important with skinny jeeans<br>  <br>  my personal opinion is that skinny legs look horrible in them<br>  im guessing huge legs would look bad too<br>  <br>  Its somewhere in the middle that works for me, but any slight imperfection stands out a mile|`|dat8eoYyaa	they make every little shape n your legs show, so its best 2 just have long thin legs 2 wear them, otherwise even if u dont have fat legs they will make them look that way n e ways|`|XTMLrSzWaa	You don't have to be really tiny, as long as you're quite slim you'll look fine.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	Don't worry, I'm size 11 or 13 and I just ignore people if they say anything about my skinny jeans, hey I'm at school and wearing skinny jeans right now. Just don't buy really really tight skinny jeans.|`|TNTFomKeaa	I think those of us women who have normal size hips look a bit funny in skinny jeans. They're not the most flattering shape, to be honest. I think you can balance them by making your legs look longer (wear heels or tuck the jeans into boots) but we don't all look as good as Kate Moss in skinnies and flat shoes.<br>  If you're not sure if they suit your body shape, take a friend or relative whose opinion you trust along to the store with you when you try them on. Personally I think boot cut jeans with a bit of a flare are way nicer and more flattering.|`|pFslPbkaaa	well, they kind of make peoples legs look bigger anyway, so if someone wears them that isn't already skinny, they look really chunky and awkward.<br>  skinny in skinny jeans:<br>  <a href="http://images.43things.com/entry/210311pw150.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.43things.com/entry/210311p...</a><br>  fat in skinny jeans:<br>  <a href="http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/luv2b4u/newpics069.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i557.photobucket.com/albums/ss18/...</a><br>  <br>  see. just doesn't look good.|`|RbsV1JvSaa	no u just have to be in proportion. nothing looks worse than somebody with skinny legs and a not-so-small belly in those jeans. but if ur that worried, u need to work on ur confidence|`|FYiKgeN8aa	How about you not worry about what somebody else thinks and think about what you would think?|`|OJWApbmbaa	No not in all cases.
LHbdPdg3aa	When you get acne, if you try to peel it or scratch it or pop it, sometimes it leaves a mark because it was scratched too deep. First, try to avoid touching it. If you want to get rid of your acne, you have to make sure that the area around your pimple is soft and just try to squeeze out pus, don't try to make it bleed. Kind of gross, but the best policy is just not to touch it. I found that putting anything with witch hazel (Burt's bees) will help make acne go away much faster, and without the spots. As for the dark spots, try washing your face then using toner and then moisturize the area. The toner should try to get the dark spots off, and the moisturizer helps prevent your skin from drying out too much. Much of it really goes away with time though, but I have those too and I usually use those products to make it go away.|`|a24ef19d34a8e1a074ec6b3f3983a7e6aa	Mederma and cocoa butter are great on scars and marks.

The only problem is, finding one that works right for you. <br>  <br>  That's why I visit various beauty counters and sites to see if they are offering any freebies. You can get the most bang for your buck this way, by testing products before spending the money. Some sites have surveys, and things of the sort, to fill out before you have the free samples sent to you, but it's definitely worth the time.<br>  <br>  Wexler and Olay aren't the only brands that have great anti-aging creams. New technology has allowed many breakthrough products to become available. Simply look for products that have natural ingredients such as, vitamins A, D and E, amino acids, and fruit extracts. These ingredients help stimulate skin regeneration and new skin cell production to tighten the skin by increasing elasticity.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped and send me an e-mail if you happen to find anything worth trying. Here's a website I've used to score some samples, you should check it out. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Stay classy!

I feel like you can't concentrate on the beauty of a person because they choose to cover themselves up with all the metal! Sometimes the small dots remind me of zits! You don't wanna have a bunch of holes in your face when your older, do ya?|`|4coBU4Zvaa	love them!<br>  <br>  not so keen on facial to others, but if it suits, its good! :)<br>  <br>  i have my nose, lower lip (left) and septum on face and 14 others on body and i ain't stopping there haha<br>  <br>  its an addiction tbh haha|`|KFuyBR8qaa	I think it depends on your style. People are going to have many different opinions no matter what. If your going to get them, dont go overboard. <br>  My person opinion is just the ears on guys, nothing to crazy.|`|U4R1J6S8aa	i love piercings!<br>  <br>  i have my tongue, tragus, and rook so far...<br>  <br>  im not done...<br>  <br>  but some people cant pull off piercings.|`|EaSEjCMZaa	I have snakebites.<br>  I think facial piercings are fine unless you have a whole crapload.|`|eBt2wwkFaa	I love them!

But I like them on other people if they have the style to carry it off. My housemate has a labret, and it looks good because she's a little bit gothy-looking, you know? I would like my eyebrow done but I think I might look even stupider than I do already :D<br>  <br>  Did the septum piercing hurt? It sounds like it would.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think you have enough holes in your face. You don't need any more.<br>  I personally don't like them. Nose piercings are not bad because you hardly notice them. But they aren't professional and to me are a sign of immaturity.|`|EcdelIHtaa	i love facial piercings but i dont like it when the rings are all huge!!<br>  i have my snake bites my tongue and my nose.. The septum is a very popular area to get it but it looks like it hurts!!!|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	i have my nose pierced, i love it|`|jmhTOXhcaa	the only kind of pierceings i like are ears, lip, and belly.

Or, on the other hand, use color in fun ways being careful not to go overboard.<br>  <br>  This a nice site for teens: www.cyzone.com<br>  It's got everything--makeup, clothes, accesories, tips, etc.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, remember to not put on too much because it damages the skin and causes it too age faster. Also, keep it moisturized so the makeup lasts longer and looks smoother with a natural glow.<br>  <br>  ;)|`|BTtWAwa7aa	ok well if u have blue eyes, bright colours  go very well, blue and silver would look nice, and with brown eyes more dull colours such as browns, Grey's, light pinks, also silver goes nice on brown eyes as well.<br>  you should also get a glitter eye liner and thinly put it on the top of your eye lid they come in many colours silver,gold,pink, purple, blue,green and so on.<br>  you should also wear eye liner not to thick though, if u are pale and have light skin and blonde hair then were brown eye liner its not so in your face, but if your dark skined and brown hair wear black eye liner, <br>  you should also get a new mascara, one that helps with flicking eye lashes up, or get some eye lash curlers i got mine for 80p from wilkinsons! you can also get colour mascara's such as pink or blue if you wanna wear something different. also a light blusher, pinch ur cheek slightly and see what colour it goes and thats the blusher you need. but dont forget lip gloss, light and shinny lip gloss looks the best, bright lip gloss makes you look like a clown. here are just a few tips i hope i helped also dont wear to much makeup natural always looks better! x|`|EZHZW7QFaa	Alot of women like to use blush but i always think that a shimmer on your cheeks is so beautiful especially with a tan. Get a really shimmery compact or powder (physicians formula is good) and put it on your cheeks its a great way to brighten your face really! <3|`|2I5XqMDzaa	get some new bright make up then!|`|Iq3KGbEoaa	Well i'm a teenager as well(13) and this is what I do:<br>  <br>  For summer you should just wear a light translucent powder, and a little concealer if needed. But if you really want to wear foundation, then I would suggest a mineral foundation. There all the rage at the moment, and I can see why because I have one and there so much better for your skin and give great coverage.<br>  <br>  Add a tiny little bit of bronzer on your face, where the sun would naturally hit it (nose, forehead and chin) to accentuate your tan.<br>  <br>  Then for the eyes. In the summer you need to go light on the make up. Just wear some bright eyeliner like: bleu, purple, plum, green or anethyst. Then just put on a flick of mascara to give you fuller lashes.<br>  <br>  For the lips just wear a little bit of lip balm, like a chapstick, or a clear gloss.<br>  And your good to go!<br>  Hope I helped...x|`|egoZtFPtaa	A good thing to do is go to Sephora and buy their eye shadow palate. Its cheap and had TONS of colors. Take it home and just play dress up. Try different shades and different ways of applying it. You would be suprised how much different you look with different colors. Bright blues and greens are hot this season...the lates Vouge has some great eye shawdows on models. Good luck!!|`|cd4bc6835c8cbe320baeec2d02112f80aa	i always love a silvery eyeshadow with a blak eyeliner. it really makes ur eyes pop. if u put white or silver eyeshadow in the inner corners of ur eyes, it makes u look brighter|`|YKFwm2eQaa	what race are you?

AA11627323	You should get what you want, where you want.<br>  <br>  Think about, distortion over time, whether you need to be able to cover it up, what tattoos you think look good on other guys, what images are meaningful to you, what do you want your tattoo to represent, look through galleries like deviantart and bmezine, etc.  <br>  <br>  You should not worry about how much it will hurt, the pain last a few hours at most, for an image that will last a lifetime.  Suck it up, it's not that bad.|`|IfzmWSevaa	UMM well you wanna get something cool like  maybee consider these <br>  <a href="http://www.jeffhardy.org/images/Jeff-Hardy-Picture.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeffhardy.org/images/Jeff-Har...</a><br>  <a href="http://content6.flixster.com/question/43/44/61/4344612_std.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://content6.flixster.com/question/43...</a>|`|AA12041870	Pick a picture that you can live with for the rest of your life, and go to a reputable tattoo parlor to get it.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Make sure it means something to you. Remember when you are 60 years old you don't want to regret it, you want to be able to look at it and think about the stuff you were going through when you got the tattoo. Good Luck! If it means something special to you then go for it. Also a lot of guys get there mom's name as there first tattoo it's pretty much a classic thing i guess.|`|tqYpkDyEaa	Don't get a stupid tattoo.  A tattoo isn't something you should just ask people and get - it should mean something to you.  <br>  <br>  I think it looks really cool when a guy has a tattoo on his shoulder blade/lower neck.|`|GWhFHqusaa	It's a lifetime commitment.  Make it one you can live with.  This goes with any decision you make for YOUR life.|`|De5Emj4Gaa	Tattoos hurt depending on where you get it. I'd suggest getting a blowpop tattooed on your member.

zDJ26bktaa	Shoulder blade|`|rFMRgHTdaa	if you don't have any tattoo's then you have your whole body to choose a spot it's not that difficult. When you pick a spot think about the pro's and con's.

It shouldn't be that hard.|`|IkXU06wpaa	on the back side of one of your shoulders|`|zzkmdusEaa	If you are a girl I would reccomend on the back of your shoulder.

YtcrB5shaa	I have shoulder length hair and get stuck with how to style my hair too as i get bored of the typical ponytail! I really liked the messy bun look but chavs ruined that look! So I begin by havin my hair straightened and then begin to slightly back comb my hair to give it volume. I then take random pieces of my hair and secure them at the back with kirbigrips and continue to do this with random sections of your hair so your are left with a messy up do look. I leave a few strands down at the front to finish the look! And finally secure it with hairspray. Its such a easy hairstyle to create and normally only takes about 15mins! Hope that has helped!

xjazE0xmaa	While GIA certifies most diamonds, it does not offer cut grading on shapes other than round (brilliants).  <br>  <br>  AGS, the American Gem Society, introduced the industry's first scientific cut grades based on light performance in 2005.  It's mentioned on the GIA Web site, in a back issue of their magazine, Loupe (link below).<br>  <br>  I took a look at the link someone else posted to Pricescope.  It looks like a helpful chart, but I don't see anything on the GIA site saying they've adopted it.

XimQM11taa	you have lovely eyes so make the most of them. with eyelines (different colours look great) you dont just have to always go for black and brown. a green would suit you. and maybe try a little foundation to make you skin look nice a smooth. collection 200 do a good one and its cheap. just make sure its the right colour. ask the shop assistant to help if needed. also a bit of blush just to giv some colour. pinks and browns are great then make the face look slimmer and make the cheekbones look better. it doesnt really matter which product you go for as long as you use a power not cream and a good brush to put it on with. also lots of mascara rimel london do a great one called sexy curls its amazing. hope i help by the way you are a very pretty young girl make the most of it.|`|aHPDAqw0aa	Oh You Are GORGEOUS!!! You are one of those lucky girls that can put on make up and still make it look natural! Good job! The probalem with a lot of younger girls is they put on too much and look a little hoochie. Definitely stay with powder, liquid is more for older women and it clogs your pores (I hate it!). The eyeliner is good, maybe you could try some light mascara. Because you are younger I would go with a soft black or maybe brown (with matching brown eyeliner) to look a little natural. Not too much but just tad to curl your eyelashes. As far as the rest goes...dont use blush, when you are younger you have a natural tint that does a hell of a lot better than putting that store crap on (just watch the power on your cheeks to make sure it doesn't cover to much, if it does rub your cheeks softly with a tissue to rub a little off for that light tint). And last of all for your lips you don't want to add anything too skanky so don't go for color. You'd be shocked at what putting chapstick on will do for your lips!!! If you really want to be different then you can have a little fun and use blue eyeliner every once in a while to change thngs up (my little sister has blue eyes so she likes to use it, it makes her different but even if you dont have blue eyes it will still look good on you, just don't use it too often, you wanna save it for that POP impression when people arent used to it). You're doing a great job so far. Way better than I was at your age.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I would not wear liner on your bottom lid it makes your eyes look too dark and too round.

I think your pretty, but if you put on  a little light pink blush with shimmer in it on the apples of your cheeks, and maybe a peachy lip gloss, you would be a knock-out!!!

If oily skin bothers you, just use blotting papers.|`|iKYNUni0aa	eye shadow|`|KSK22vHUaa	You don't need make up.  You have pretty amazing skin and you're lovely without anything at all.  <br>  <br>  I'm sure that's not what you wanted to hear and what you've probably heard plenty of.  But I'm serious.  Make-up is something to use when you're broken out or going to an opera.  It shouldn't be a daily routine for someone with flawless skin.  And there are plenty of guys who prefer women who leave the make-ups alone.|`|BKxAt8mNaa	Did you apply that makeup? If you did, well done! When I was 13 I was terrible at applying make-up.

UojyaVglaa	you should NEVER match your makeup to you clothes. you should match your makeup to compliment your eye color and hair color. think color wheel. orangish tints compliment blue eyes. if you have brown eyes you can wear most any color shadow you want. redish colors compliment green eyes. matching makeup to clothes just looks tacky and monochromatic, and does nothing to enhance your face.|`|eGoATfMLaa	Well...

I always just wear whatever color looks best with my eye color and skin tone. For example, I have medium skin, hazel eyes and dark brown hair,so i wear gold, purple, white. light pink, browns, SOME greens, and peaches or mauve.<br>  <br>  If you want to match your eyeshadow to your clothes, you can do it, there's just a trick. Don't mach EXACTLY right. Either do and off-shade or a contrasting one. Like, if you're wearing black, wear a white shadow, for red, do pink. For blue, do a golden, or if you wear green, put a purple or mauve shadow on.<br>  <br>  Hope this gives you some ideas:-)!!!!!!|`|z9st8cLvaa	I always wear earthy tones because it suits my complexion best, regardless of what I'm wearing.

Hope I helped! <br>  <br>  And good luck, it can be hard finding the right colour!|`|mgeuli7Naa	Black- brown<br>  Red- black<br>  Pink- hint of purple<br>  Orange- barely some blue<br>  Yellow- purple<br>  Green- pink<br>  Blue- brown<br>  Purple- black<br>  <br>  This is what I wear usually. <br>  Or if I think it would be too tacky then I wear just brown. <br>  Brown goes with everything.|`|mX9z4jHIaa	I just like to wear bronze or natural colors, they look fab and match everything.|`|tjygT8Uzaa	don't wear any, just plain old eye liner and mascara and then u never have to worry about it, nothing goes with everything
UCkluEDTaa	I like the 2nd one, the Miss Sutra. It's cute and can look elegant, too. The other two are too tarty for my taste.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	The first one is my fav......very sexy and sleek, but still not too trampy like looking.|`|IfzmWSevaa	I think the 2nd one it is very cute and ya got great taste in style <3|`|82A8E4yzaa	OMG !! i love the first one...it looks so elegant and covered up..but still sexy.<br>  <br>  But ...if your over a size 12 ..i don't think it would be a good idea as its just a very fitted dress. The 2nd might be best.<br>  <br>  The third is also nice , but i think isn't that nice compared to the 1st..which is really Amazing !|`|Ac0jF74vaa	1st one is my favourite followed by 3rd then the 2nd one|`|0gFdt7VUaa	3|`|ZKw46efXaa	hahaha i have the second one!! <br>  <br>  love the first one too but second is nicest!|`|6xf1GfbUaa	Definitely the 3rd. It has the elegance of the first and the cuteness of the second, so the 3rd is perfect :)|`|4qcXI0niaa	i like number 2 cause it's a nice colour & it looks nice with the netting over it & it's stylish & cute & the bow on it tops it all off.|`|WWanOxHVaa	The first one definitely, the lace is bang on trend.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I like #2 best then #3 and my least favorite would be the first one|`|RbsV1JvSaa	theyre all decent. i like the third the best though|`|2I5XqMDzaa	the 2nd is really cute|`|9QAVNJtWaa	best is 3rd then 2nd then 1st|`|B0CQi0m7aa	I like the third one,I think It's sexy and serious at the same time.|`|xiof3yz6aa	The bottom one looks like it might have a fun back!|`|b7PRtoyxaa	the first!
rTaaIXSuaa	16<br>  To the answerer below me,<br>  My son who is 17 works at Vans in the shopping mall here in out city. He has been with them since he was 16.|`|72b8e259282adf95aac618be249d964daa	usually clothing and shoe stores only hire 18 and up
1ioI2py4aa	on top if it has detailing on the collar or if it is a pretty colour. experiment and see which looks best. also see if you can help make up your mind by putting pieces of jewelery on to see if that makes  a difference
AA11461724	no, don't do that. you should buy a box of "color oops" from walgreens or rite aid, it's like 10 dollars. they make extra strength to remove difficult colors (what i recommend for you) and extra conditioning. it works really good, it removes all hair dye in your hair and brings you back to your natural color. but since all hair dye, dark or not, has peroxide, your natural color under the black may be a little lighter, or brassy than your actual color because 20 volume peroxide alters your color. it recommends that you dye your hair a shade close to your natural color after you use it, to cover up the brassiness. it works really well, you put it in your hair, wait 20 minutes then you have to wash it out, and rinse for about 15-20 minutes because it washes away all the color, just be sure you wash and rinse very well 'cause you could miss some of the color but you won't see it once your hair is dry and any other coloring process after that could re-oxidise the color left in your hair after you re-color. it says the more you rinse, the better your results. i used this stuff the other day, trust me, it works. good luck!|`|oENKYc7Kaa	If it's old color it's there to stay until you take it out. And to do the process at home is going to be messy and your hair is not going to come out. Heck it's hard to do in the salon but there you have all the tools and knowledge. I would go to a salon and get heavy high lights(high lights doesn't mean blond they can be any color) that is usually more cost effective then taking out all the black color(that's considered a corrective color) also with the high lights it's easier on the hair and comes out more even. make sure when you ask that you tell them you want more of the high light color then your black(heavy high lights) also if moneys a issue go to a beauty school. They have salons with older students and teachers over seeing them, to make sure nothing goes wrong. hope this helps|`|xMTkyaRuaa	The only way is to go to a salon and get the black lifted out, & dyed back to your natural colour. Its pricey but better than trying to do it at home and turning carrot.|`|MubMJThHaa	You shouldent have dyed it black. Black ruins your hair go with a dark brown from now on|`|qnd4UbNYaa	DO NOT DO THAT. my friend tried that and they're hair was pretty much ruined
pfgnSDT8aa	I'd stick with accessories- Headbands, scarves, that sort of thing... <br>  <br>  However, if you are determined to tie dye other things, stick with one color dye and white, not that rainbow tie dye that should never have happened.|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	To tie dye clothing and accessories is a little retro, so sounds interesting and fun.  I would tie dye portions of my jeans or other pants but nothing too funky.  That could be retro and stylish.  I would stay away from shirts and blouses as that will stand out too much.  Don't tie dye head bands.  Looks too much like early 80's.<br>  <br>  Have fun......  ;-)|`|yP9uPmbKaa	Personally i think tie dye went out with hitler... dont do it...to any of your clothes, iwhy dont you just dye them in a different colour if you want to make it different.|`|BdbieVyvaa	You can tie dye a hair band. Don't tie dye anything to extreme like a shirt or skirt. Those will really stand out. Start small and work your way big! Have fun!!|`|kBBFbTPiaa	i would tidye like a swim suite ithink that would look cute|`|b3iuhwuPaa	well if u posted a pic on here then I would've checked
d8EYaNw2aa	ummmm China?????????? that means they are fake anything besides coach is made in other places besides china like france and spain and italy yeah so ummmmmm listen to your self please just listen to what you are saying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YUgyMxnbaa	you may try www.favorgoods.com, they are a good compney to buy from and i have been doing  business with them for 2 years, and what i love is their fast shipping. their prices are ok i belive.
OXOHoISraa	no. not that tattoo. that sounds awful.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	The only person you should be asking about this is yourself. These are permanent...for the most part. Unless you have tons of cash to have it removed by laser...which leaves scarring. If this is what you want and its something that you think will be cool for your lifetime then go for it. I personally would NEVER get my name tattood on my own body.|`|rFMRgHTdaa	Yeah on your calf.|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	You should get it on your leg if you want it there. It's basically up to you not us on where you want it. Sounds like a cool tattoo to get.|`|NR1VMmTpaa	To be honset its does hurt to have it on leg, because i got one just other night.....my first name|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I guess if you are over the age of 25 and still think its a wise choice?|`|DWFMM23Caa	I wouldn't do it...its a puma ... its not even in fashion to go out of fashion!|`|0CTNLag4aa	a tattoo on your leg is a good place and if thats what u really want i say go for it. i have one on my arm and one on my back, the problem with the one on my arm is that when i was younger i was pretty muscular and liked to wear tank tops alot and of course the sun over time causes fading and also unfortunatally people do look at u differently because of it being on ur arm. atleast on your leg its protected frm the sun and its also verry easy to get to if you want to show it. its also an easy spot to hide it for professional reasons(work) if you need a certian image to uphold for your profession.|`|8D76XK0Oaa	No, because when you age..the Ink bleeds a little and it looks fuzzy. If you get a tat then you should get a vertical one on your arm. Like someone would have to turn their head to read it.|`|95NXBdWxaa	hello, first of all think of  whether you really want it or not and how will it look in the future...<br>  it is your decision but id recommend you asked some friends or something<br>  hope it helped|`|v6un21wYaa	The only person that can answer that question is YOU. :)
OXOHoISraa	you are probably fine. the top layer will come off. just keep it moist to keep it from cracking too bad.  Don't put neosporin on it. That is awful advice. You can use tattoo healing ointments, but as someone with a lot of huge tattoos, unscented lotion like lubriderm will do just as well and cost less. wash with dial and apply a thin layer of lotion 2-3 times a day.|`|Vrzn4r8Qaa	Tattoos usually scab. Especially if they are big. The one I got last saturday is scabbing a lot. It's normal. And when you shower, you're nit supposed to let the water run on it for a long time.|`|PTmg0dcYaa	yes they do scab.and the dead layer will peel off. the tattoo will look more like a tattoo after that. be sure to use plenty of lotion.|`|8a46cf985d12bfcd9a6c364a7844b9a6aa	It will have some scabbing, but you REALLY need to keep it moisturized! If not, the scabs will get too thick and can actually pull color OUT !!|`|68lLAQnKaa	put lots of neosporin on it and cover it, so its not rubbing against your clothes, I've seen tats scab before, you just want to take good care of it so it won't get worse, or infected.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	It can sometimes scab. I know when I got mine they said that. Mine never did though. Just keep using the tattoo goop they gave you and do not pick at it.|`|c5d771b4a5fe3772df346e3ce4f775d2aa	Sometimes scabs happen.  One way to avoid it next time, or try to avoid it next time, after you wash it, blot it with a papertowel until it's dry.  Your skin will ooze plasma and cause a scab to be heavier.  Also when you wash it, massage it with your fingertips and antibacterial soap, it will feel slimy, massaging it will help rinse off that extra plasma.
tObHGRGDaa	depends what kind of scars but I have a few examples I've learned from.<br>  Oke so my lil 2ed degree burn scar on my hand.. the sun makes it darker i have to drench it in lotion.<br>  Other scars like linear ones / cuts become hardly visable if they get tanned with the rest of my skin.<br>  It really depends on what kind of scar your talking about.<br>  But I think any scars should be lotioned and protected because their more susceptible to the sun|`|2Urd6VLqaa	Scars don't tan.<br>  Tanning will only make them more noticeable.<br>  <br>  ?|`|ZrS4I4lNaa	Try bio-oil it really does work. Great on scars, stretch marks and blemishes. Approx ￡15 a bottle but lasts for ages and you can even use it in your baths.....<br>  <br>  Not sure about the tanning but I should imagine it would tan the same =)

283tO9j9aa	Out of those colours, purple lasts longer. Trust me, I live in a house of metalheads and between us we've had every colour hair you can think of. Purple can look really bright even with a normal hair dye as opposed to an extreme one. Something like Live XXL will lift the black enough for your hair to get a purple shine to it and as you freshen up the dye each time it'll get brighter- partly because your hair is also growing out the black.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you might have to go to a hairdresser and get your hair bleached or stripped first. I definitely wouldn't suggest doing that at home.|`|YFeznXFOaa	if you dye it a bright color eventually its going to fade away and look weird. i have pink streaks but now they're more orangey since its fading away and i got my hair bleached so it  could last longer|`|G1G9gJj4aa	when i was younger i used to dye the **** outta my hair for my liberty spikes, i mean many of them were diff colors than the other ones haha<br>  i find strangely enough that green dye, you can get it from rite aid, i forget the name of it, but its sooo vibrant and like BAM in your face to the point where its almost metallic looking if you have shiny hair...youll know when you see the box its in as i recall its silver<br>  and its not really lime green either, its like a bit darker, in fact i think if you left some of your hair black and dyed parts green in a stylish way, that would look pretty sick<br>  anyway thats my advice :D<br>  now can you give me yours<br>  have really long hair and i want to cut it short but i dont know how...help me please<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305091403AAR6c1D">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|iRRNMbQKaa	Bleach it first, so when the color fades out, you can put new colors in.

xEZclTh4aa	what happened is that your labret stud is now embedded in your lip. go back to your piercer and the they will have to basically scratch of the skin covering the back and pull it out of you, the same thing happened with my snake bites, its because the labret you're using is too short and your lip kinda "ate" the back of it. if you're planning on getting it re done you'll have to wait till your scar tissue heals up, you'll know because there will be a bump where your piercing was and when the bumps go down you can get it re done, but i had my snake bites taken out about 2 and a half weeks ago and they are still bumping up a little bit.|`|XldpadWqaa	Go to the place where you had your piercing done, see what they can do. if not go to the doctors or your GP. they probably have dealt with these things before.|`|N17W5XRQaa	im no expert but see a docter befor you do anything cuz it could be infected...you might have to have it removed|`|br1FB5rraa	Wow, that sounds discusting.

Your face shape is very similar to Kelly Osbourne and there for her style would suit you extremely well. On the other hand you could go for a layered, choppy bob which would frame your face.

twWQwax9aa	I have bought from a few online shops and it works great for me!<br>  <br>  Once you have ordered a piece of clothing from one site and try it on you will know what size you are with that brand. Then you will know what size to order the next time!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	I have bought clothes online. I either buy brands that I know what size I wear, shop at stores with generous return policy (so if it doesn't fit I can send it back, no questions asked), or I buy from individual shops where I send them my measurements and they make a custom garment for me.|`|pfgnSDT8aa	I buy online, but only from stores that I've shopped at before, or tried on clothes from at least. That way, I know what size I wear at that store, and also know the quality. The only time I take a chance is if it's a really good deal, like when I find a shirt on Ebay for $10.<br>  <br>  As for delivery, I've had delays with delivery because of my university's screwy postal system, but I've always gotten the package eventually in good condition.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	i do it all the time. its about a 50/50 chance if it will fit and all that but it works for me

QAM3gVs6aa	Yh try it on your own, see what you think but it takes some time getting used to dying it on your own. That was the situation with me! Now i can do it just fine!|`|PUAUR9Quaa	well considering i have only ever dyed my hair once and that time i got some1 else to do it for me I'm not an expert BUT il try and give you an answer<br>  <br>  i think it's just like washing your hair isn't it? just with dye|`|UhmrCbHuaa	I've had people do it for me before, but i've also done it myself once or twice. I have medium length hair, and i have a lot of it too, but i find, if you just start off at the top smoothing it all down, and then just kind of squeeze it all over and go crazy with it! It's quite easy i guess, kinda like shampooing your hair. You have to be careful it doesn't flick anywhere though, so don't go TOO crazy xD As long as you have a towel wrapped around you, and the gloves on...<br>  Remember to use an old towel after rinsing it out though.<br>  I LOVE your hair colour in that picture btw, i want red hair like that because i like the twin's hair off of skins lol.. (don't know if you know them but yeah..)<br>  Did you have to bleach yours before you put that colour on? because i have quite dark hair, so i'm not sure it would come out.<br>  (Sorry..i'm kind of not answering your question here..) ANYWAY yeah, try doing it yourself! You have more control over it then, so you know which bits you've done and which bits you haven't, and you can get an even coverage..just be careful lke i said, about flick your hair around too much whilst doing it.<br>  Go0o0od Luck ><|`|f75x8aI3aa	Nope, it's very easy, i use the same dye as you and have done for over a year now.<br>  <br>  You said your hair is medium/ long, my hair is quite long, roughly down to my breasts, i had to use 2 hair dyes when i did mine, if that helps at all...?<br>  <br>  I personally find it easier for someone to do mine for me, at home because my hair is quite long. But you should be fine if you do it in front of a mirror and have section clips to clip back the parts you have already done.<br>  <br>  Good luck, i love the colour, i'm sure your hair will look lush (=|`|f85e8c43bc505af3ef679172049bef87aa	It's not hard to do at all. You follow the directions on how to  mix the solution and its easy from there. Use all of the dye and apply it to every area of your hair. Pile your hair at the top of your head and continue adding the dye. Work it into your hair as if you were washing it. That's all there is to it.|`|sOZoonICaa	the best way to dye your own hair is to separate your hair into sections go straight down the middle parting then with clips hold both sides in place then part your hair again down towards the top of your ear and repeat on other side your partings should look like  a hot cross bun then go down your partings then take a section at a time and apply colour to the roots top and underneath hair and so on until you have complete overall coverage sounds hard but very easy|`|kAzdk2blaa	First of all i love you hair colour, my hair is also bright red but i go for a cheaper brand than xxl, it's superdrug Colour Performance, (permanent) it's really easy to use and the dye comes off your skin alot easier to other brands. i have tried alot believe me! but yeah to the point, as long as you have a towel wrapped around you and the gloves on it's easy, it's a liquid base dyed and turns into a light moose once applied, just rubbed the dye into your hair as if you are putting on shampoo and really make sure you get into the parting. with long hair i would wrap your dyed hair in a towel when waiting. to make things easier i have a body shower including washing hair because you then don't splash it everywhere. after you have done it a couple of time it gets easier. don't pay Salon prices unless you are getting different colours put in. that's my advise.|`|803d7a60e642d4a568204ac15d119dd0aa	I do it myself all the time and find it really easy - I've used the exact same colour Live XXL Red Passion and the only advice I will give is put some vaseline all along the edge of your hairline (just skin not hair), doing it yourself can get a bit messy, the vaseline stops the colour from getting on your skin. <br>  <br>  I like to start with my hair parted as it would normally be and going from there as opposed to back to front - too difficult alone.|`|KFuyBR8qaa	I dyed my hair for the first time ever last month by myself, it was easy. Just start at the scalp and work all through your hair and put some on the middle and tips and spread, my hair is pretty long. <br>  If you think you'll run out of dye get two boxes.<br>  <br>  Cant really mess it up just make sure all your hair is covered, good luck.|`|Ilq7WEM5aa	It's not hard at all.. Just make sure you got your gloves on and a towel around you.. Start from your roots and work it down to the ends.. When you're done use a hair  comb and brush the dye through to make sure you get the dye at every part, and massage it through then clip it up and there you go =)!<br>  Good luck x|`|YnEKOJayaa	it is not difficult at all.<br>  i do mine all the time, i have shoulder length hair and its kinda thick and i use two boxes<br>  <br>  and i also wear extensions<br>  <br>  but yea it is no hassle very easy too|`|5KcUyLFRaa	Its not too much hassle. I do it. My hairs medium length, and I find you may need to spend some extra time making sure you've got it all thru the back of your head, but otherwise it's fine.|`|NUPJ9DiKaa	well i personaly don't find it that hard and ur right it's not worth the hassel of having other people do it for u.|`|o1L7Yyr5aa	I think It's pretty easy. Yeah, and it's worth the price too. Red hair is pretty! :D|`|7uqzTFwraa	hey lovey!! :)<br>  i used to dye my hair exactly the same colour.. myself!! its not hard to do.. and actually easier than you think!<br>  only problem is.. doing it yourself.. you might not get every root. i mainly done my parting.. and all around the head first.. but if you split your hair into sections.. it should be a lot easier.<br>  also if possible.. try only to do your roots.. as i have found out.. it dries your hair out and makes it very brittle dying your whole hair each time.<br>  i preferred to dye all my hair again because it brought out the colour more.. as i found that live red.. colour runs out after a few washes.<br>  but its not a problem.. there's no harm in doing it yourself once :) always have that extra dye just in case.. and a mate on standby! :)<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|vb1fIAuEaa	i dye my hair all the time myself, I can use ONE bottle, but my hair is down to my belly button, and it gets really blotchy if you dont have enough hair dye.. if you're only going one color, it shouldnt be as difficult. but two will be a little more challenging. but yeah, the only problem you should have is getting ALL of hair hair with color. I've pretty much had every color in the books, and each time it was so blotchy..|`|rUC7WHLVaa	I have done it before and it was fine..just get it all covered..I had to use 2
sOZoonICaa	a skin test can be done on the inside of your arm or behind the ear i would not recommend you do it your self tho as in a salon they usually add a peroxide and a dark tint mix a little together then put that on your skin.|`|v85qngXNaa	Uhm,  Yeah. Your skin isn't just gonna melt off. But it probably will burn.|`|pTWIhkPtaa	put some behind your ear;)
mDt03eXIaa	If she's getting the eye surgery in a month (meaning this is not a permanent makeup situation) maybe just leave it. If it's something that's been going on for quite a while, she'll be embarassed anyway, knowing she's been walking around with clown paint on her face for however long. <br>  <br>  I guess it depends on the type of person she is. if she's sensitive about going blind, and finding out that her makeup sucks would be another blow to her, don't tell her. If it;s something you think she would be able to laugh off and take in a stride, then tell her, gently, that maybe she should consider laying off the makeup until she gets her surgery.|`|EDiJe38Taa	If it were me I'd want to know. It all depends on her personality though.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I would want to know - but I would want someone to tell me in a really kind, gentle, non-accusatory way.<br>  <br>  You might say something like "Sarah, I think your makeup is a little uneven. I know it's hard for you to see to apply it - is there anything I can do to help?" And be sure to add that she's beautiful without it.|`|JYXDj402aa	i dont wear makeup or anything.<br>  but id want to know if i looked bad. the point of makeup is to make you look better

But I think it would look very elegant to wear a black pencil skirt with black pantyhose and black stilettos ?|`|d8EYaNw2aa	i wear high heels all the time:) and depending on the shoe will wear knee highs and sometimes i will wear pantyhose with a skirt!|`|yP9uPmbKaa	i do but i think all women do|`|AA12177562	high heels all the way!!  and pumps! ohh i wear pantyhose whenever im wearing uncomfy shoes(under jeans..UGH  pantyhose are ugly!) i only wear knee highs!|`|RkJBKQNWaa	I HATE nylons.

AA11896276	we had cosmetology. in school.<br>  That is what they teach you.  Hair , make-up ,nails. Nutrition for beautiful skin. How to take care of your skin etc..<br>  I learned a lot of stuff I still use. I do my own hair ,  and have made a few bucks  for doing other peoples hair, nails,etc.. too. <br>  <br>  I say take those classes, if you can get in one.  They are very popular  and fill  up fast.<br>   It will help you out in the future  with keeping  up your own looks  (cheaply)  and  it might inspire you to go through Beauty School  and get your license. Hair dressers  make great money.<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Yeah, It does. But you can't charge people intill you get your license. It's illegal.<br>  Cosmetology programs in school are like Beauty schools, except there kids in high school, and don't do hair all day. <br>  <br>  and you can't go to beauty school intill you have your HSD. So, unless(Which I'm assuming.), you have a cosmetology program in your school, You won't be able to do hair.|`|jtjISk6qaa	i guess, thats what its for right? my high school used to offer a cosmetology course and those students whould do girls hair nails and makeup for prom. (this was way before i went there though)|`|Dm3AHmG5aa	I say go for it, it will help you out a lot. And besides what anyone else says (SORRY FOLKS) you can make you a little extra money doing your friends hair, just PLEASE stick to simple hair styles. My 13 yr old daughter does her friends hair, my nieces, but I don't let her do perms,relaxers,dye, cutting stuff like that she sticks to braiding, curling and styling. And she makes money which keeps her from hitting me up for all that crap she wants that I'm tired of buying, like those very multi colored tennis shoes and all those big necklaces and bracelets you teens wear these days. Not to mention she has a goal now to finish, school get her license, and open her own salon. And it keeps her occupied on weekends. I'm sure your parents will appreciate all of the above.
4v0Ies06aa	you can like dip your fingers in some really spicy hot sauce just on the tips of your fingers then wipe it off. so later when you start biting them it will taste bad and you wont do it anymore. after a while you wont need to do that anymore and you wont bite them. its an idea..|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Whenever you start to bite them go and find something productive to do. They also have nailpolish that tastes really bad that you can put on your nails.....my 4 year old does this and I use the nailpolish on her and it's helped alot.|`|Dhsyroekaa	get that nailpolish that tastes gross so when you go to bite your nails it will taste gross!!! It worked for me!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Or try to keep busy so you dont have time to bite your nails!  <br>  I use to bite mine until they bled and there was hardly any nail left! now i have long beautiful nails :)|`|drHzNxhxaa	Well there are a few things you can do to stop biting your nails.  <br>  One thing is to paint your nails because that will make you notice if you are biting them more easily.  Also if you get a french manicure of something, it will stop you from biting them because you wont want to waste the money you just spent on your nails,<br>  Or you can put fake nails/ acrylic nails on over your nails because when you go to bite them it wont feel right and eventually you will stop.  <br>  Lastly,  you can try putting something on your fingertips and nails so when you go to bite them it will taste bad.  <br>  The only way these things will work is if you are constantly trying to get over the problem.|`|lf3JqYKjaa	I'm 14 as well<br>  I went and got my nails done (french manicure), and then if i chewed them they would mess up. It worked for me, and whenever i started to bite them then i thought about the nice manicure i got and how i would rui it. This made me stop :)|`|4H5sxsLCaa	concentrate on it, you have to start realizing what your doing to actually stop doing it, Or if that's too hard. then go buy some nail polish that's out there specifically for things like this. It stinks, and you stop. :]|`|lYDQrqaeaa	I actually wear nail polish and I dont bite them otherwise there i go...|`|UlRtt7Wjaa	I have the same problem and im 20! trust me u wanna stop n fast lol... i hate my habit i have tried some things but the best that has seemed to work for me so far is buying nail biting polish it is sold at beauty stores ask about it it has a nasty taste just paint your nails occausionally or as often as you need to  with it and u will taste the horrible taste it projects good luck

If the grey is a lighter color, you could do a dark grey with it.  You could also do light or dark blues depending on the exact color of turquoise you have.|`|cGQWFSXSaa	white could be a nice contrast, as well as black. depends if you wanna draw attention to them. if not then choose black but if they are essential to your outfit, then i say choose the white one. ;) good luck.|`|ex6khUqqaa	Blue|`|qUbJbu64aa	i would say black.

0cfi2HZDaa	Your daughter's makeup wearing is only as healthy or unhealthy as she makes it.<br>  <br>  I teach a skincare education program catered especially to young ladies ages 11-18.  I always tell them that if they really feel they need to wear makeup, then to be sure they have a solid skincare regimen (cleansing, toning, and moisturizing/SPF daily, and exfoliating and masking treatments once or twice a week) and are using quality makeup.  Once your daughter has a proper skincare routine taken care of she will be able to prevent skin problems due to use or abuse of makeup, as well as prevent sun damage.<br>  <br>  As for the makeup itself, I always suggest a high quality pure mineral makeup that is non-comedogenic and has an SPF of at least 15 in it.  This way she won't be clogging her pores or putting harsh chemicals on her face, and will be protecting her face from the sun's harsh rays.|`|mp5Vg7Peaa	It can if you dont look after your skin before and after.<br>  Make sure to:<br>  <br>  Step 1] Cleanse- buy a good cleansing lotion to get rid of any trace of make up that can get stuck in your pores and cause spots.<br>  <br>  Step 2] Tone- Toning is an important, a toner restores the PH balance in your skin,All skin types should be using a alcohol free toner. Alcohol is a drying agent and that isnt the aim for anyones skin, not even oily skins. <br>  <br>  Step 3] Moisturize- Your last stage is to put some moisture back in your skin. Again use a moisturizer that is designed for your skin type, Its best to use 2 seperate moistuizers, one for the day and one for at night <br>  <br>  Use an exfoliator once a week to get rid of dead skin cells|`|o01QtRwWaa	It depends. Most makeup has tons of bad chemicals in it. But there are some brands that are all natural, and that do not contain these chemicals.

If you have to wear it daily then make sure you wash 2 times a day morning and night and use a anti aging cream. The chemicals in make up can ruin your skin and also they say it can make you age quicker.|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Think it depends on the brand of make-up you use and what you use to remove your make-up as well.|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Wearing make-up every day won't affect your skin as long as you wash it off every night and be sure to use a deep-cleansing mask every so often.<br>  There are some brands hat are better than others, I like to use neutrogena foundation, it's formulated for teens and it won't make you break out or clog your pores. It's $12 a bottle @ walmart.<br>  <br>  It won't hurt to not wear make-up every day. Tell your daughter that most guys will prefer natural girls anyway.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	It's bad if you don't wash it off at night as it clogs pores. I haven't heard any proof about it ruining your skin if worn for long term. However, if you're concerned, you can get her the minerals make up. I've been using it for a few months and I think it improved my skin.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	short term: clog pores<br>  long term: chemicals can cause premature aging and many chemicals found in cosmetics (like parabens) have been directly linked to cancer..<br>  <br>  <br>  dont listen to the answers you get here.... 2/3 of them are under the age of 18 and like to shoot off at the mouth wether they know what they are talking about or not|`|KmC0K59taa	I'm 29 and I've worn make up every single day since I was that age.

L9Q6r42Qaa	Red is a VERY hard color to get rid of.(especially if you're blonde naturally) You may need to bleach again or strip it, either are going to fry your hair. I do suggest seeing a professional. Their products are less harsh than box colors.  It can be made the color on the box or close to but your hair will be extremely damage with the all the processing you'll need to do.|`|AA12004844	They should be able to get the color you want, but you have done some SERIOUS damage to your hair and it is not advisable.  If you do go through with it, be upfront and tell them exactly what you used and then be sure to follow whatever aftercare instructions they give you for conditioning, etc.|`|AA11340418	No it is really hard to get the exact color on the boxes cause it is hard to compare with the color you have now, the best way and cheapest way to find the color you want is to go to a supply house open to the public buy a bottle of your developer and the colors you want you will find that this is really simple developer comes in all different sizes. then you take strands of your hair, (not all from the same spot but underneath) then almost all hair dyes are mixed 2b to one read directions or ask before leaving store(these people usually are licensed) then do  a series of strand test till you reach your desired color.  This  is no more time consuming than it takes messing it up and make sure you do a good deep heat conditioning when you are done with your hair because it is really chemically dependent right now [lol] if you have no hair dryer then put your conditioner in then take a wet towel heat it in the microwave then put plastic bag on hair and wrap with hot towel 2 to 5 minutes|`|Ilq7WEM5aa	Well a professional should be able to do it, but it's gonna take more than one trip to the hairdressers. Red is very hard to get to blonde, i've experienced it.. <br>  She will probably need to bleach it again and use toners.. Don't expect a great result the first time, i mean of course it all depends, it could even happen from the first for you, but going blonde from dark, red even takes different stages.|`|bj7bnZ2Baa	Well professional hair dye is much stronger than box dyes. When you die your hair a very bold colour such as red it would stay there for a longer amount of time than a natural colour. Box dyes are not as trust-worthy to receive the hair colour on the box. So I think a professional would be able to achieve a very similar colour.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.<br>  x|`|MorbsRp5aa	my answer go to a hair store and ask question|`|0hgQjpAsaa	Hello!  I think your new haircolor looks great.  Give it some time as you said--about a month.  I do believe you can get it the color on the box.  It's not that far off!  There's a product additive you can add to your haircolor to get certain tones out.  In your case, you just have some extra red tones.  There's something called 'red out' or 'no more red'.  It comes in a packet and you mix it with your desired haircolor.  That should lift out some of the reddishness so that the blonde comes through.  I'm constantly experimenting with my hair and on here for advice, too!  I dyed my hair dark brown (my natural color is blonde with highlights added) with a semi-perm color (loving care).  I used a color remover to get it out, and it came out hulk green...lol.  That is where I'm at now and trying to fix it.  However, I've been in your shoes before.  Your hair looks to be very healthy and shiny, but wait a few weeks anyway just to be safe, and go for your desired look.|`|QljGsjsBaa	Your hair is a nice color now. It's not like it turned green or anything.<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do to make it more blond except for re-dye it, which I think will ruin the texture of your hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck and don't forget to condition!
0cfi2HZDaa	It is recommended that everyone cleanse, tone, and moisturize on a daily basis so  it sounds like you have a pretty good routine down.  I noticed that you're on Accutane so I am glad to hear that you're not exfoliating with anything harsh. <br>  <br>  A few things I would suggest:<br>  - Get some SPF into your moisturizer!  No one should ever, ever leave the house without some SPF.<br>  - Don't tone your face with pure hydrogen peroxide; dilute it with some water before applying to your face. However, I suggest using witch hazel (which is fabulous) or a product specifically created for mens' shaving/toning.<br>  - Try to work a treatment masque into your routine once a week.  If your skin is dry, try to find a light and soothing gel masque that will refresh and hydrate your skin.  If your skin is more oily or prone to breakouts, try something with a bit of clay in it to draw out impurities and refine your pores.  <br>  <br>  As for the vitamins, I am not a doctor or nutritionist so I cannot specifically advise you in that area... but I can say that I take most of those vitamins myself on a daily basis and nothing looks to be out of order.<br>  <br>  Keep up with the skincare regimen.  It's always nice to see men putting time and effort into their skincare.
FxAWhiTWaa	wigs are great! i wear them all the time because they allow me to change my look to suit my mood. No one has ever reacted negatively when i told them it was a wig because they thought i looked good and had in an expensive weave. Also the wigs of today are WAY different than the wigs of our grandparents' time. Have fun! and don't be worried, most people don't even realize when others are wearing wigs.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	Well, I think a wig on a woman is a lot more acceptable than a hairpiece on a man. I think you should just go natural and be confident about it.|`|AA10236694	id actually would wear a quarter wig there more comfortable|`|oFeNwMheaa	no be free! be natural!!|`|yhkEyVXLaa	no, i would not do the same.  If anything, I would work it because you did it to yourself.  You had a style that was ok, not great on you in your opinion and then chopped it off into a style you now hate to the point of getting a wig.<br>  <br>  Look at Beckham's new do.<br>  <a href="http://images.fa-bulo.us/uploads/4039.gif" rel="nofollow">http://images.fa-bulo.us/uploads/4039.gi...</a><br>  <br>  try something like that.  Any style can be girly on a girl as long as you have the style and the confidence down pat.<br>  <br>  Life is too short to worry about things like this.  At least you have hair when others don't.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	1 Wigs can be fun, especially in role play,wink. <br>  <br>  # 2 I think you should not care if people are starring one way or the other, wig or no wig.<br>  <br>  # 3 I would not care if I felt it was right for me. <br>  <br>  Now if you are that unhappy seek other opinions about what you could do with your hair now visit a shop or two or ask someone with a short style you could live with where they go. If you hair is 3 inches long you do have style choices even shorter ones a buzz cut looks good on some ladies and would surely attract attention. Seek professional advice but remember its your hair.
0IniVZNOaa	Deff, the juicy couture it is sooo cute!!! i really hope u buy it! because it looks very chic and dellicatess. the other one looks kinda business and hard core.|`|5v5pyjfGaa	Personally, I would rather have the first one. I zoomed in on it and on the strap it's a copy of alligator/snake skin, which adds style to it. The numbers are lovely, easy to tell the time with the large numbers. The rim of diamonds is cute, gives a feminine lush to it also. I would just be gentle with the strap, doesn't look 'hardy'. If it breaks you could always go to a shop and buy a strap, I recently did so and the workers at the atch shop were very helpful. Good Luck! Hope I helped :)|`|RkJBKQNWaa	The Juicy. Classier, more unique, & just over all cuter.|`|V9PXzTGoaa	The first one.  It's different then normal watches.|`|htD82ij1aa	the first one, i like the shape and look of the face better|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I love the first one. Its cute and stylish and the white really pops! The second one looks more....manly I guess. Its big and a little bulky for my liking.|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	I love the juicy one. The otherone looks too manly with the circle face.|`|czAbrzcUaa	I prefer the second because I don't like he diamante bits on the first one. But I'm not keen on the white straps tbh, they look a bit tacky even though they're quite expensive. Black would look much classier.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	number 2 because thats more my style thing.<br>  it looks sheeker, the other one looks too old fashioned.<br>  i didnt look at prices or brands so its based on looks.<br>  how vain? lol|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	the first one- I like the style better|`|IBqjTKfWaa	the first one. it's more glamorous and stands out more. :)
ezT7xruoaa	in general, those hair/nail vitamins, sometimes called vitamin H or biotin. BUT: a lot of companies are making a lot of money from this, and you don't really need it, unless you are on an unhealthy diet. (you know, like a vegan, or cutting out a whole food group) You will get enough of this in your normal diet. <br>  <br>  I have found that, personally, my hair has grown longer and stronger since I started using a special conditioning mask after shampooing, and before using normal conditioner. Its meant for people who's hair never seems to grown beyond a certain length, and its making a huge difference.|`|9Fq3jyykaa	I can not say for sure but I have been taking Biotin for about 1 month now. I have not seen much of a difference yet but Im hopeful.<br>  Good luck|`|273vsUezaa	Just take a multivitamin.<br>  <br>  nothing but actual pregnancy (NOT the prenatal vitamins) will make your hair grow FASTER. There are some times where your hair will grow SLOWER than normal, but that is almost always a sign of poor health or diet.<br>  <br>   Just fill in the cracks by taking vitamins and your hair will grow as it should.|`|bjuSB8k6aa	these two should work|`|IDcIww7Baa	Biotin. Do not take prenatals unless you are pregnant, lactating or plan to become pregnant. They can contribute to the growth of kidney stones if you take them when they are not needed.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I have tried all three...Biotin should help, but it needs to be taken for a reeeeally loooong time before you start to see the results. Like a year or more.|`|c4AJTvuPaa	Rosemary and sage supplements will be best for hair growth and nail growth. I have personal experience with this and it works.  It will also give your hair a remarkable natural shine. You can purchase these @ any healthfood store. Try them.
xUy7B5vDaa	Go to your hairdressers and possibly get it relaxed and thinned out so its easier to manage.<br>  <br>  I recommend GHD Straighteners and rinse you hair in cold water once you've finished shampooing and conditioning as this smooths your hair follicles and you'll notice added shine - really does work! and its free :D <br>  <br>  Also, what products do you use? I don't think smoothing balms / serums work personally, just bog down your hair and make it greasy! But i do really recommend a good shampoo & conditioner, even if it means digging a little deeper into your pockets.<br>  <br>  The L'oreal brand is fantastic for my hair, which is thick and prone to be dry at times too! You can buy these from hairdressers or off eBay! I use the pink bottled one for dry hair, it gives me good results! Try this product, or shop around and try different ones to see what suits your hair!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|159b24ad2cea2ed0e8f59b46099c5829aa	i'm a hairdresser so i can help чou!<br>  use a citric shampoo with lemon and fruit's in this is the correct shampoo! it also tame's the hair and control the frizz also if чou use hairstraightners,hairdrчers or curling tongs make sure that чou use a strong heat protection spraч before чou start!|`|XlxQoVU2aa	that's what my hair used to look like until i started using these products:<br>  -andrew collinge simply no frizz shampoo and conditioner,restores natural oils in your hair to get rid of frizz<br>  -pantene time renewal nourishing mist,takes care of heat damaged frizzy hair,leave it in over night after you've washed your hair<br>  -johns frieda frizz ease curl reviver mousse ,keeps your hair in place all day,makes it nice and shiny and keeps frizz away all day even if it rains!<br>  -pantene smooth and sleek styling milk,great for if tour hair is a little frizzy and your putting it in as you go out the door,also it smells great:)<br>  <br>  hope i've helped|`|U3GjgcItaa	right when you get out of the shower put about a dime size amout of conditiner in your hair and rub it threw and then comb it threw and it will deffintley help your damage hair out alot.<br>  Hope i helped =]|`|AA11208986	use conditioner|`|88ababd1e9191bd2edc85721d51568e7aa	olive oil|`|l6s1DMB6aa	Hi Sweetie :) <br>  Don't cut it - lol!

9qxQtLYTaa	thanks for ur review- i happened to buy the covergirl professional loose powder yesterday, b.c i rele needed a loose powder, and it was only $6! its the first covergirl face product ive ever bought, and i was skeptical about bbuying it because i have oily skin, and i usually prefer more expensive brands like clinique. but, if ur gonna buy a loose powder, it would be kinda pointless to buy a rele expensive one that costs $20+ b.c its basically transparent, not to be seen... so ya the cg powder was pretty inexpensive and for the price i think its great, there seems to be alot of powder in the container so its sure to last for a long time. it kinda has some shimmery stuff in it, but it isnt overaly shimmery in a bad way, it gives luminosity to your skin, w/ a matte finish-it rele sets my makeup and gives such a nice finish to my skin, better than the finish you would usually get with pressed powders=)<br>  ?|`|2ZtKyUoLaa	omg i know! <br>  i love that foundation! i buy the cream kind<br>  <br>  its soooo perfect<br>  <br>  i spent so much money on the stupid MAC Studio Tech foundation, and its great but its breaking me out badly and the sponge sucks!<br>  <br>  waste of money <br>  thank you for your advice but i already knew, i think thats nice of you to want to help|`|a122b01b1756aff821e49bd8aa9c60d0aa	Thanks!

sZYvKohcaa	I absolutely love it. I used to be like many on here and thought it was so gay until an ex-boyfriend and I were goofing around. I put some on him and thought it made him look incredibly hot. I have now convinced my current boyfriend to wear it also.  The trick? I VERY thin line above the upper eyelash. Don't smudge this line or if you do, smudge very slightly. A slightly thin line of eyeliner below the lower eyelashes. Smudge this line or you can use a wet q-tip and eyeshadow to create more of a smokey look under his eye. <br>  Mascara on men is great also. Just don't put it on too thick. A light coat - one or two passes - will completely accent a mans eye!|`|ns1F0p8Laa	I don't think its natural for a man to where makeup.|`|lGF9GpI1aa	gay, gay, gay.|`|sFASHCNRaa	it's hot but only when applied messily...i don't know how to better explain it lmao.<br>  <br>  like when it's a PERFECT line...it's just gay. you know?<br>  <br>  not that being gay is wrong...but you asked what a girl would think about it lmao. :P<br>  <br>  like when you put on eyeliner, smudge it.|`|60668e20144a7d7b9a1bd023ec2a40fcaa	It should only be used by rock stars and cross dressers!

7Pq8k3bbaa	First, buy a watch from a legitimate company.  Second, buy something that you can actually afford.  A replica watch is a throw away watch.  If it breaks, no reputable watchmaker or jeweler is going to service or repair it.<br>  <br>  If your boyfriend likes a specific Rolex model, consider buying a "homage" watch instead.  Generally, "homage" watches are manufactured and warranteed by legitimate watch companies (ie. Invicta, Defaubre, Suttomarina Italy, etc.) They also use reliable and serviceable automatic or quartz movements -- Japanese (Citizen/Miyota) or Swiss.|`|FYiKgeN8aa	Wow...you want to get your boyfriend a replica watch for his birthday...how tacky is that?<br>  <br>  Why not just get him a nice looking watch that is real?|`|rKaUdhLUaa	Aww come on Heather, she's probably like 15.

Even a "cheap" rolex will cost you over a grand in most cases and it will probably be an older one and maybe in need of service or repair (service is about $600).

KOpzPTDcaa	If you go to an optician or an optometrist they can help you find a color that you like.  Just go to your local mall and find a Pearle Vision and make an appointment.

Ilq7WEM5aa	Um that's sorta hard but another way to get your hair curly without using all those is to put all your hair in plaits while wet use a little mouse for volume and a lil hairspray and when you wake up take them out.<br>  And there you go|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Nope. II'd say chemicals, Bust since you don't want to use Curlers or anything, I'm assuming you don't want to use Chemicals. But there isn't anything else. (And scrunching doesn't work, It's suppose to bring out the natural curl, not make it curly.).|`|jtjISk6qaa	braid it at night when its wet, put a little gel in it. take them out in the morning|`|tzXSxTDKaa	well a good way is to put pleats into damp hair and sleep with them in over night, how big you make the pleats determines how big the waves will be. Another way for curly hair is to put one or two twist buns in it - to do this take a large section of hair and twist untill it goes into a spiral then clip it and do the same with the rest of your hair then in the morning you should have nice curls.|`|aElNZoaKaa	well my hairs naturally curly [ im not bragging, its awful and a nightmare to straighten!] but my friend likes her hair curly so when she gets out the shower before school she uses hair curling mousse scrunches it and lets it dy and it gives it nice waves/curls. ino you said no scrunching but you dont have to scrucnh it proper. i mean squirt it in you hands and squeeze.scrunch it in, theres no other way really xD<br>  <br>  im not sure what brand it is, its either tresemme or vo5 but i would imagine any brand should work, good luck :)|`|DfJ1fHEBaa	get a perm if you really want curly hair, its a nightmare trust me.
eYiq6OBKaa	Where as it is very unprofessional to leave stains on clients, Im sorry to say some stylists just don't pay attention. If you have the time, go back to the salon and politely ask them to try to remove it. In most salons, we have color remover that is made specifically for doing so. I wouldn't exactly cause a fuss yet, unless of course it cannot come out, which is rare. By going back, you let the stylist, who may have been inexperienced, know that they need to pay attention. The manager will most likely, and should, compensate you for your troubles. (coupons, discounts, etc)<br>  <br>  <br>  If you don't have the time to return to the salon, you can go to your local beauty supply and ask for color stain remover. its not very expensive and you may even be able to find some in your local drug store in the hair color aisle. I prefer to use use Roux Color Remover. Works great. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IxWNkLtzaa	Did you go to a reputable salon or not, that makes all the difference. Go back tell them whats happened,they should be able to get rid. Best thing is to put a layer of vaseline around the hair line before you die it, this stops any stains, the salon if they care about there customers should fix it.|`|J1kJb98Maa	you say you "don't want to make a big deal out of nothing"<br>  but then you want to go complain about it???<br>  you cant be a nasty and nice <br>  so which are you?|`|flahjTR9aa	Yes!!!!!!!!!  That is really bad|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No, I wouldn't bother. Color stains skin, whether you wipe it off, or not. It's like permanent marker.

66SYpKzNaa	The best thing to use is sea salt solution. I'm no expert, but I don't think it's infected. If you're really worried just go back to the place you got it pierced and ask for some advice. It stays red for quite a while - a few weeks. Mine didn't go red for a couple of days after I got it but then it got really sore.<br>  <br>  It should be fine, don't worry.|`|ezzSeBnLaa	3 weeks isn't enough time for it to be healed. Your body is still trying to reject the piercing. You also might be allergic to the jewelry. Another option is that you tore it or pulled it (maybe in your sleep) and damaged the hole. <br>  <br>  If you have pus coming out of the piercing, then it's infected and you're going to have to take it out. Just keep cleaning it and it should heal up. However, I would suggest that if it doesn't improve in a few days, contact the piercer and/or a doctor.|`|vCn5leQqaa	use tea tree oil to wash it twice a day. and after havin a bath/shower, bathe it in sea salt water to help the skin harden and heal it|`|1evqSw67aa	sounds like it is infected, savlon should help but I preferwarm salt water<br>  <br>  good luck|`|JPa0GzDjaa	Use salt and boiled water, I believed that worked best with me for all my piercings.<br>  <br>  Navel piercings are quite common for getting infections due to the dust and dirt that falls off of your clothes.

I didn't even know about the salt soak things then. But if your going to do the salt thing then use pure sea salt. in hot water but not to where it's burning you. Do it for about 10 minutes. It should be as salty as ones tears. Then wash it off with warm water.<br>  I'd say it's most likely infected. You might be able to clear it up with the salt soaks. Wash your hands too before you do anything to it.|`|AZYvuU6Uaa	Aww - ouch hun, sounds sore :(<br>  <br>  If you are really worried about it - which it sounds like you are - go and see your doc. Better to be safe than sorry and it will put your mind at rest. If it is some kind of infection the doctor will be able to prescribe anti-biotics that will clear it up in no time :)|`|PeNTl6KOaa	it sounds like its infected, use salt water, its much better<br>  <br>  mine got infected but i didn't go and see a doctor so it kinda ripped out and now i got a reallly big scar there.<br>  <br>  go see they doctor to se what he says to be safe :)

Changing hair color to what is best on you can be determined by your skin tone, whether it is golden undertone (which is probably is) or bluish.

OyKrB63waa	The best thing to do is to go to a sally beauty supply store or one like that and buy a bleach kit that suits your needs. After you have bleached your hair, you can put a semi-permanent on it to tone out the brassiness or to make it whatever shade you prefer. <br>  <br>  I suggest you do a lot of research online about how to apply bleach to your own hair online. Watching youtube applications helps as well. A lot of people will tell you on here not to bleach it at all bc you'll destroy your hair, but if you know what you're doing and take the time to learn then you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  I went from black to blonde. My pics are at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/madyabyum" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/madyabyum</a>|`|j3Gs9wkeaa	yes u should.  If it's Ginger n ur not liking that tone try a semi permanent light ash brown.  It will look so nice.   <br>  <br>  I had done my own highlights n they turned out too bright n with reddish tones.  I applied a semipermanent light ash brown n it looks great.   It's fading off a lil but looks nothing like the mess it was n it blends beautifully with my dark growing roots    <br>  <br>  I tried. Light golden brown before light ash brown. N I found it still look reddish.    Supposedly.  Ash colors cancel out red tones<br>  <br>  Good luck

ERjGLJaEaa	I don't have dental insurance and I got mine done at my dentist. It was $600 and it was called Zoom clean or something like that. It was a long day, but they look great and they gave me a mouth piece and lots of my own whitener to bring home with me. I do that every couple of weeks. There really is a difference...and they look GREAT. I recommend anyone to do this. Its totally worth the money.|`|AA11950233	many people are happy with whitening strips. <br>  <br>  I got a custom mold from my dentist & use whitening gel.|`|XTepTcoCaa	Los Angeles Procedures For Teeth Whitening<br>   <br>   The teeth whitening business is doing great in Los Angeles; it is truly an industry of million dollars. If truth be told the dentistry business earns the lion's share of its revenues through teeth whitening as people take great pride in flaunting whiter teeth and glowing smile. Los Angeles in one such state where the organic produces are a craze, the method of natural teeth whitening is also gaining popularity over time.<br>   <br>   Los Angeles is the home for all the fashionable people and celebrities in the business. This is probably the biggest reason why the teeth whitening procedures here in the city is the in thing right now and is here to stay for ages. The inhabitants of this state are indeed some of the big names in the glamour world and are persistently scrutinized; the people here are the ones who need to keep their teeth whiter and better to portray their confidence and complement their looks. A dazzling smile makes your appearance younger, better and nicer to look at.<br>   <br>   <br>   The dentists here in Los Angeles have brought in a revolution in the teeth whitening market with their advanced options, such as:<br>   <br>   Laser Teeth Whitening<br>   Zoom Teeth Whitening<br>   One Hour Teeth Whitening, and<br>   ? <br>   <br>   The above mentioned procedures are indeed some of the best in office teeth whitening options available till date and can show you instant results. However, these teeth whitening treatments are a bit expensive and might not fit the budget of most of the people in the state.<br>   <br>   The price constraint has giving a leap to the at home teeth whitening procedures and kits available in the state. Though all of us would love to have smile like that of our favorite Hollywood stars, but not all of us can afford to spend so much for the cause. So the ones who want to get teeth whitening done in less-expensive way, it would be the at-home solutions for you. Some of the best and the widely used at-home choices for teeth whitening include:<br>   <br>   Perfecta Teeth Whitening Kit<br>   Crest White strips Dental Whitening System<br>   Rembrandt Teeth Whitening System<br>   <br>   Though these kits are inexpensive, but these aren't the best alternative however. These procedures aren't really as potent as the ones recommended by the dentists and would not produce the same results, which is a disadvantage. Also, these products are to be used over weeks and months to get the kind of effect that you want which is very much unlike the treatments and procedures carried out by the dentists.<br>   <br>   Apart from all these treatment procedures, you can always use teeth whitening toothpastes and gels on a regular basis to get whiter teeth, but the actual results might not really manifest.<br>   <br>   The choice here, though unlimited, has some associated constraints as well for the common mass. So it is the people of the sate who will have to decide what to opt for regarding their procedure of treatment. Also, teeth whitening become essential when people have stains and marks in their teeth. Such stains aren't just ugly to look at but might as well have some other hidden cause. It is definitely important to identify the cause of the problem. Sometimes, the stains in the teeth are caused due to damaged tooth nerves also.<br>   <br>   Besides all the treatment procedures mentioned in this piece, there are several other available alternatives as well, like Composite fillings, Porcelain Veneers, Crowns, Fixed Bridges and Dental Implants which the dentists here in Los Angeles often use for treating dental patients. Though these procedures involve a lot of cost, but can give you the best results.<br>   By: Matt Wittchow.<br>   Dramatic Smile's dental  Teeth whitening  are a great way to whiten your teeth.

The bleaching agent in these products is usually carbamide peroxide, which is available in 10, 16 and 22 percent concentrations.<br>  <br>  Whiteners that contain peroxide typically come in gel form and are placed in a mouthguard. Some products are used twice a day for 2 weeks while others are intended for overnight use for a 1 to 2 weeks period. If you can obtain the bleaching solution from your dentist, he will be able to construct a custom mouth guard to fit your teeth precisely. Currently, the American Dental Association endorses only dentist-dispensed home-use percent carbamide peroxide tray-applied gels. <br>  <br>  In addition to bleaching solution, whitening strips are increasingly being used as a preferred tooth whitening product. For instance, you are now able to get your hands on a set of Crest Whitestrips Supreme from any convenience store. The flexible, invisible strips are coated with an enamel-safe tooth bleaching gel. To whiten your teeth, you simply place the strips on your teeth and wear them for about 15 to 30 minutes each day. After a period of about 21 days, you should be able to see a significant difference on the brightness of your teeth. <br>  <br>  For other effective home teeth whitening solutions, you may wish to read about them here :  <a href="http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house.com/Articles/Home_Teeth_Whitening.php" rel="nofollow">http://teeth-whitening.my-fashion-house....</a>|`|PTWnWkPRaa	If you are 18+ you should go with zoom whitening. It is very painful but you get great results, from what i have seen and heard. Call Dentists around your area and see what products they have. Some dentists have websites you can go to see their work they have done with teeth whitening and or other work.|`|Yn80qqX8aa	It can be a good or bad result.
gIgbQVVEaa	The mascaras that I would highly recommend are Maybelline's Define-a-Lash Volume Waterproof Mascara in Very Black or Rimmel's GlamEyes in Extreme Black, although I'm not quite sure if it's available in waterproof formula. Both of these mascaras emphasized my lashes that now I do not have to wear eyeliner anymore because these two mascaras define each and every lash and the color is so bold that you don't have to worry about it fading away. They both will volumize and lengthen your lashes, but you always want to try and curl your lashes so your eyes seem bigger and more awake. I will guarantee that these mascaras will give you the results that you are looking for because I've had a hard time looking for great mascaras and I've finally found them. Hope this helped!|`|zzkmdusEaa	Lash Blast Mascera....anything by covergirl is also good too|`|yLY8B4scaa	get waterproof Maybelline Colassal mascara in black or get waterproof Lash Blast Covergirl|`|HIwJFtNlaa	Bobbi Brown's new Long Lasting No Smudge Mascara.<br>  Water resistant and it really lengthens very nicely i love it.<br>  but i also recommendthat you bring an old mascara brush or an eyelash comb because it can get a little goopy when you first apply it.<br>  But when I wear it and I then put on my contacts, and my fingers are wet, my mascara resists smudging.

That's because my body caught up with my feet so it can all balance out.|`|B5QD6GzSaa	I am 15, and i am 5'4" and I think that you are about average height.

At least a former adult girlfriend of mine told me her shoe size which is 6-1/2 or 7 was what a 9th grader (14 year old) would wear and she seemed certain. Don't worry about shoe size, smaller is better anyway for a female. Consider yourself lucky to have a smaller than average shoe size.

pn9q0JkXaa	Revitols stretch mark cream works great as a prevention and it can also remove existing stretch marks. <br>  It carries all of the natural ingredients you need to keep your skin in a decent enough condition, allowing preventive measures to be taken.<br>  <br>  The natural ingredients include Vitamins A, D3 and E, aloe vera extracts and grapefruit seed extracts. These ingredients together help to stimulate skin regeneration and new skin cell production plus to tighten the skin by increasing its elasticity.<br>  There are no harmful substances in the cream so it's great for pregnant women.<br>  Women have seen results within TWO weeks when applying the cream three times a day.<br>  <br>  So yes, it really does work,  and it's not too expensive as well!<br>  If you want to know more click on my source. <br>  <br>  Good luck

MPztCHj0aa	Bootleg jeans help to balance out "large" hips, although flared might also be a good option.  Dark jeans are best here--ie, no faded ones, etc, which really just draw the eye down and make your hips look bigger.  Dark wash jeans are the type I like the best.<br>  I would suggest button up shirts left untucked, as well.  High-heel boots can also provide a great slimming effect along with the dark jeans.<br>  <br>  Also, anyone who answered "less food" is a moron who didn't read your question.  Sorry to comment on that, but it pissed me off that some people can be so incredibly dense.|`|33ZElB2iaa	try wearing your pants a little lower or higher that always worked for me. or you can try wearing a bigger pant size too.|`|MnaTP8wzaa	just don't wear anything.|`|b6461d8a8d3d34ce5dac5c4052085372aa	Don't argue with nature and genetics!

uC55n3HIaa	Well, you should take some classes in textiles, sewing, and design. These will be helpful for later on. Also get good grades so you can go to a good fashion college like FIT. You should check out <a href="http://www.designerbloc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.designerbloc.com/</a> as well. It's a community for aspiring fashion designers to display their designs, get community feedback, and meet other designers. Good place to show your designs. Good luck!|`|S6h1qsQ4aa	omg, im 14 and would love to be a fashion designer too ! xD<br>  lol.,x|`|dxuCoW8Aaa	There's a lot more to being a designer than just being able to draw pretty clothes. You'll need to go to fashion school, you'll probably want to go to school for business as well if you plan on having your own business and being your own boss. Success as a fashion designer is rare and you'll probably lose money before you make it. Before committing to something like that I would suggest you make sure that that's something that would fit your life style.|`|qUbJbu64aa	GO TO SCHOOL, then go to New York. You will deff get a job there. HAHAHA that iss so cool that you want to do that as a job. Good luck girl :)
fD8FbikHaa	Your verry pretty! maybe some blue eyeliner. Let your hair down with nice layers. Light Pink lip gloss. A bit of mascara. Do not put too much eye makeup on it might look bad. Other than that you are very pretty and do not need much makeup!|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Umm well to start with the hair. I think a good cut with some layers and some color. Its very pale and dull. Maybe some light brown highlights or even ash blonde. As far as makeup...nothing too drastic...maybe just a little eyeliner and some mascara with a nice glossy lip gloss. Clothing wise...anything trendy. Charlotte Russe.com, forever21.com, americaneagle.com.....Good luck!|`|AZYvuU6Uaa	i really think your pretty katy, your skin is flawless!<br>  <br>  if anything i would say grow your brows in a little fuller, but that really is just a very minor thing - you're lovely :)|`|zDqlHcGSaa	Well, you need some color, so I would suggest a lght pink blush with shimmer in it, and maybe some bronzer. Definitily a soft pink lipstick, and some eyshadow, maybe a white or silver or pink.<br>  For your hair, let it down and blow-dry it, then flat iron it. You would look cute with side swept bangs or layers around the face.|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Here are some suggestions but to enhance your beauty your a very beautiful girl just plain, hair ideas maybe a layered casual cut and a darker tone, and make-up ideas brown tones for mascara, eye-shadows, and a peachy lip color;)|`|PQzDFcMOaa	i think you look fine the way you are.  you have great skin.  Maybe a more sun kissed look.   Browns and golds with some eyeliner.   and maybe go a little bit blonder|`|W5eqw3lVaa	Let your hair down<br>  put some curles in!<br>  Wear brown eyeliner, mascara<br>  and pink lipgloss<br>  great skin btw :)|`|ydHU7gYIaa	well, youve got a lighter skin tone and hair color (which i love), so i would counteract that by using golds and bronzes on the cheeks and eyes. girls think they have to go by "cool" or "warm", which is untrue- the opposite is actually more flattering half the time. think "warm" tones like orangey browns and golds. you dont need much though, so just use it sparingly|`|MIRQscqcaa	Starting with make-up ... I think you should use a bright blue eyeliner as your hair is quite light. The eyeliner will also make your eyes POP! You can get it from AVON for under ￡4. <br>  <br>  Hair... If you took your hair down and maybe straightened or curled it, it would look fab! If you haven't got layers or it its not feathered then i think you should get this done. Please DONT get a fringe. You might not like it and it takes ages to grow back! TRUST ME !! <br>  <br>  I think blues and reds would suit you but you could also try light green. Stay away from lighter colours as your only fair and this could make you looked faded whereas you want to stand out! <br>  <br>  hope i helped!    Maddie xx|`|jtAJyz2haa	:) <br>  <br>  you have all really great features. so you would look good in alot of colors ect.<br>  but i def think you should get your hair cut with bangs. <br>  they would really accent your face and eyes. i also think you should wear eyeliner on the bottom. buy green and blue clothes. you skin and hair goes good with those colors :) <br>  <br>  and girl you hawt|`|hdFSt0xNaa	Your already pretty the way you are, but to put the icing on the cake, I suggest....<br>  <br>  More fuller mascara, a little eyeliner, put your hair ash blonde as its a little pale....ash blonde just enhances the blonde and makes it look a lot more colourful and some blistex roll on (it has a metal roll on ball tip). (: It makes them nice and shiny while caring for them! (:|`|KGJHXvflaa	Layers!
AA11461724	with hair and thc, (the stuff in marijuana that gets you high) thc is deposited in your body and shows up in your hair. it can never be washed out out or even bleached out. it can only be cut out. i have never been hair tested so I don't know how much of the actual hair they take they test; just the root or the entire strand. that i don't know but if you haven't submitted the hair to be tested yet, i would get a trim. but since you smoked more in the summer, the hair that would have any thc traces in it isn't grown out that far. but if you never really smoked a lot, i don't know if it would have deposited in your hair enough to be found. the only way to really know is just wait and see. good luck though!|`|KTO7rJuqaa	Toxin wash is your best choice there..<br>  Shaving your head isn't going to get you anywhere, as they can test hair from other parts of your body; or test the hair follicle.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, click the link below, should help you out.<br>  ;]<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|QX4SEHg7aa	your screwed...<br>  <br>  unless you shave it all off....<br>  Trust me.

vZ4NXlBmaa	no<br>  <br>  you want to wait until it has completely healed...even though you're excited about getting it done (price of doing business)|`|rFMRgHTdaa	I think that once the tattoo artist sees how it looks he/she will let you know if you should wait longer or if it is safe to finish the tattoo. I would recommend that you wait 2 weeks after you got it that way its completely healed. Good Luck!|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	You need to wait till that one is completely healed before you move on to the next part.|`|zzkmdusEaa	No.<br>  <br>  Your tattoo is still in the healing process. If you want a good turnout then it would be smart to wait until you are completely healed and then go get it finished. You don't want your body to start rejecting the ink, I doubt your artist will even touch a needle to you until you are completely done peeling.<br>  <br>  I would wait up to a month tops when it feels like a regular part of your skin. Tattoos aren't something to become impatient with, this will be on your body forever and your just going to screw it up by getting it finished when it's not done mending.<br>  <br>  Not trying to be a jerk about it, i'm just telling you the reality of it and the consequences of thoughtless actions such as this. Wait until you are completely healed dude.|`|c5d771b4a5fe3772df346e3ce4f775d2aa	No you shouldn't do anything to the tattoo until it's texture is the same as normal skin.  After a tattoo starts to heal the skin will look thin and shiny and may continue to peel.  Remember... not till the texture of the tattoo looks like normal skin.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	yea. you are supposed to wait 2-3 weeks go get a tattoo touched up or worked on some more.|`|OXOHoISraa	It really depends on your tattooer and what your tattooer thinks. We went in 2 week sessions regardless of the healing on my back piece just because he rarely hit areas he had already done. If your tattooer is a professional, then they can tell by looking at it. <br>  <br>  That being said, I am always itchy the 3rd and 4th week after getting a tattoo and it has fully healed. I don't know what is up with that.
YHXEF2YQaa	yes i agree with that...|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I think that people are always going to have their opinion of you. Us as people are just usually judgemental. Its life I guess. Me personally..I always try to look at the good of people and let them know. I think though sometimes you may think that a flaw that you have is just unbearable, but to other people it really isn't that bad. Sometimes we are really harsh on ourselves..more than we need to be.|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Yes, in every way and it's odd;)<br>  -just one of those things we won't ever quite understand;)|`|UojyaVglaa	of course i believe that's true. haven't you ever heard the expression " you are your own worst critic"? stop being so hard on yourself. having some self-confidence will make anyone seem more beautiful. people pick up on that. stop downing yourself by scrutinizing every single flaw and tell yourself your beautiful, then you will be.|`|SRVXka9Iaa	YES<br>  its because we notice all our imperfections<br>  where as others dont look as closely<br>  :)|`|oZODexjaaa	Yup, i definitely agree with your answer :D<br>  It really does make sense no matter what...:D<br>  I see myself OKAYISH..<br>  and others think I'm cute and pretty...=/|`|Xtj4kvwsaa	oh of corse. we all look for our own flaws before people can find them first and comment on them but usually they dont even care all that much cause their caring about their own appearences.  think about it, that one bad day when you woke up late so you just threw on what ever you found and brushed your hair for school,  you were worried about what you looked so much that you didnt even notice the girl across the room had the same problem.
thF7daiZaa	Try washing your hands with dandruff shampoo every day instead of regular hand soap (unless you're pregnant). Or ask your pharmacist. They can give you something otc that will help reduce oil production. If that doesn't work, ask your doc.
Ilq7WEM5aa	Yeah it's safe to do it yourself, of course there WILL be different shades to your hair, like where the blonde highlights were they might come out a little lighter but it'll look good trust me.<br>  Maybe try getting a dye without ammonia so it causes less damage to your hair. <br>  An ammonia free dye i love to use is L'oreal Casting here's a pic..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beautyheaven.com.au/product_images/12626/im_1.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.beautyheaven.com.au/product_i...</a><br>  <br>  It gives you a very natural shiny colour and doesn't fade too easy.|`|vb1fIAuEaa	its deffinataly safe.. my aunt is a hair dresser and color wont damage your hair at all. only bleaches.

Au4gWgEiaa	I have always just used regular anti-bacterial soap or any unscented soap and all my piercings turned out fine.  Try not to use soaps with irritants in them (dyes, scents, etc) and you should be fine.  <br>  <br>  As a side note, you can take it or leave it....<br>  <br>  For the saline solution, you can just mix up 1/8 teaspoon sea salt (its a couple bucks for a thing of it) in 1 cup water and heat up as hot as you can take without burning yourself.  Soak your piercing for at least 10 minutes.  For your septum you can throw some cotton balls into the water and use those to soak, changing them when they cool.  For his anti-eyebrow he can use an inverted shot glass...|`|m2Q2099Vaa	You can just mix 1 teaspoon of salt water with 1 cup of boiling water and wait fro it to cool down and use that, and replace it every day.|`|foGsTKpOaa	i just used salt + water and it's obviously cheap and fast.<br>  it's 1 tablespoon of salt to 1 cup of water. and you just put it on the sides of it and rub it in|`|8D76XK0Oaa	Cetaphil will work...its very gentile also|`|ERjGLJaEaa	I always just use antibacterial soap. I've never had a problem. I just make sure I keep the area clean and washed.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	I only use saline soaks.<br>  Never used soap, as noone really uses it here, and everybodys turn out fine. Satin and provon soap are the only ones used here, but as I'd have to import it. Its really not worth it.<br>  <br>  I find homemade sea salt soaks are a teeny bit better, just cause they're warm, and help soak off crusties more easily. But big bottles of saline are cheap enough, and you don't have to worry about too much salt.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'v never used Cetaphil or Spectro Gel (or entirely knw what they are), so I can't really offer much about that....

You could try that, too.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Diet and Excersise.......you are not going to lose alot of weght in two weeks. The average weight loss is like 1-3 pounds a week.|`|2Urd6VLqaa	When I want to lose some weight I just eat ONLY Special K cereal.<br>  Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.<br>  <br>  They also make these body wraps that make you loose weight. I've never tried it though.<br>  <br>  ?|`|ptDkPkd8aa	It's all about the calories my man, like crisp celery stalks literally has like no calories (most veggies don't for that matter) but celery has bunches of fiber used to make people feel full, and celery tastes good with peanut butter. To get skinny you need to run a lot too (burns calories fast). I suggest running long distances in combination with sprints. One thing I remember in track was my varsity long distance coach jog 5 min sprint (all you have) 30 seconds. It really shredded the excess fat I had in a relatively short time.|`|gBPaNfUcaa	Put your finger down your throat and puke up everywhere You fat bastard!<br>  <br>  then go eat some maccy d's.<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  PS: Cos i'm hard.|`|RkJBKQNWaa	Adderall, cut out pop, drink a lot of water, and EXERCISE.
twWQwax9aa	I wish I was taller but I'm only 5'2!<br>  <br>  You should be confident and embrace your height! At least you'll stand out in a crowd!<br>  <br>  All I get is aww you're so sweet, you're so cute or you're just like a little doll!<br>  Patronising!!<br>  <br>  So YES wear heels your heels with pride!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|YsAEPYwOaa	No you are perfect, plus most guys love a girl in heels because it shows you have confidence, class, and sass.|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	Firstly, you are not tall. lol. When I saw this question I thought u were going to say you are 5'10. I am 5'7 and when I wear heels it makes me around 5'10 or so..depending on how high the heels are. It's great feeling tall and having people notice you. I don't like short guys anyway, so it wouldn't bother me that I was taller than random guys who I wouldn't date anyway....|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	How can you wear heels and not feel tall?  Did you really just ask that?<br>  <br>  Well, if it was evidentt to you, you could:<br>  <br>  Wear shorter heels or<br>  Not wear heels at all!<br>  <br>  I'm 6' tall, and I still wear heels.  Must be a self confidence thing.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	Your never too tall to wear heels. I'm 5'7" and love wearing heels as high as 4". But if you still feel uncomfortable go for a pair of kitten heels. That way you get a little height without a significant height difference.|`|VrjF986Aaa	5'5" isn't tall<br>  i'm 5'7" and I wear heels all the time<br>  they are so fab|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	you are never to tall to wear heels|`|t3w3cDduaa	I think you should just have confidence and wear pumps all you want!  I admit that I do sometimes feel insecure when I wear pumps, but I'm 5'9".  My roommate is 5'7" and she wears them all the time!  If I were your height I would wear them all the time!  Don't worry about being taller than guys, just work it!  You'll look sexy because pumps make your legs look great!|`|nidCgr73aa	Course not, I'm fourteen and 5 foot 7 and wear any size of heels I want (and can walk in). I tend to wear 3 and a half inch heels.<br>  <br>  Just wear your heels, the boys must be tiny where you live if you feel much taller than them with heels! Have confidence!<br>  <br>  I plan on wearing heels no matter what height I end up.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|vCbM6yJfaa	im 5'9 and i wear heels<br>  and i don't feel to tall<br>  i like it<br>  X]<br>  <br>  also if you don't like them you can wear Kitty heels and they make your legs look good like in heels except the heel is like an inch max|`|ngDjTbTnaa	No, not at all. If you really feel uncomfortable you can wear short heeled shoes but I'm 5'4 and I think it's the best height to enjoy pumps ;)|`|FYiKgeN8aa	No way!  I'm 5'7" and I wear heels!  My husband is 6'3".|`|bed4c33bdb3017e1a505b0d8611e0264aa	You're definitely not too tall to wear heels!|`|oKZZ3vxLaa	It doesn't matter if you're 5'5" or 6'4".....<br>  as long as you stand straight and not hunched over<br>  like your embarrassed of your height, then even the<br>  highest of heels are perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Men can SEE you're in heels and they KNOW your<br>  not really that tall...so don't let the fact that heels <br>  make you taller than most of them intimidate you.<br>  Men LOVE  to see a proud statuesque woman with<br>  a great set of legs in heels.<br>  <br>  My best friend is 6'1" barefooted and you would not<br>  believe the amount of men between 5'7" to 5'10"<br>  adore going out with her....even when she wears<br>  high heels!<br>  <br>  Wear your heels with pride and guys won't care how<br>  tall you are or aren't....they will just be transfixed by<br>  your beauty.|`|dxuCoW8Aaa	No one, I repeat, NO ONE is too tall to wear heels. A friend of mine thinks the same way as you but I am a true believe in the power of a good pair of heels. They do wonders for your legs and take any outfit from 0 to 50. If you're really self concious in them than go for a nice kitten heel.|`|5v5pyjfGaa	Not at all. I'm 6"1 and still wear them, they give women the appearance of being intelligent and feminine. If you feel embarassed of being "too tall" then just get a small heel. Hope I helped. :)|`|5vtZVLdIaa	No way 5'5 isnt tall at all. Plus you can always choose shorter heels. I have the same problem, Im the same height as my boyfriend without heels. I hate that! But heels are amazing, they make people look so much skinnier|`|SVwljA6maa	well no im 5'7 and i wear 5 inch heels. i say the taller the better ... and if you still think your to tall and unconfterble wear flats ... or grandma shoes|`|tcKt7vl2aa	Don't wear heels and you will be more healthy and you will get better guys !|`|8D76XK0Oaa	No, your not too tall for heels. Just don't wear really high one (like 6'' ones).|`|3yesYdBAaa	no your not to tall.|`|F8zjiOJ4aa	just wear short heals
ERjGLJaEaa	Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes...|`|AZYvuU6Uaa	I think it does affect it but not always in a negative way. And from the front you cant really tell if it is pointy or not as you really need to see it in profile.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend has a, not pointy, but prominent italian nose also and he hates it. I however dont think it is anything out of the ordinary and i dont even see "a nose" when i look at him. I just see him! And if im being biased, his big gorgeous blue eyes :) (which he also hates lol)|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i think the most prominent feature on your face is your nose and your eyes<br>  think about how drastically the structure changes when you get a nose job<br>  the seen aesthetic of beauty is not merely to have a pointy nose, but also a straight nose<br>  you can see this in many magazines and how people who want plastic surgery wish to remake their nose<br>  <br>  beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but standards in fashion usually set beauty by the nose then the cheek and facial structure|`|hX1Qfs3qaa	It depends on if their nose is obvious or not. If there's nothing too noticeable about the nose, then I don't think it affects beauty. If it's big or pointy, sometimes I think it actually makes the person more beautiful. I think it depends just on how someone's nose works with their face. Prominent noses aren't always a bad thing, but sometimes they are.<br>  <br>  Haha, that probably doesn't answer much.|`|3Z4YFz29aa	like Nicole Kidman's new nose? I don't like that, but she also shortened it.<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer noses that are a bit long and straight, <br>  <br>  Ashlee simpson looked better pre-nose job.
FYiKgeN8aa	All of the "you can't" answers are right.  Even if they did look real, how are you going to feel knowing that they are fake?|`|ERjGLJaEaa	You can't. There are characteristics of the real boots that make them real....the ugg label on the back..the materials used. You can never make a fake real.....just buy the real thing.|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	Find/make a lable with ugg on it and sew on?|`|M1PYqC3qaa	You can't, sorry, it's as simple as that.<br>  My friends always notice a pair of "FUGGS" as we call them ... if there is no UGG label on the back, then everyone walking behind you will know that they aren't real.<br>  I used to have FUGGS, I didn't like them. I saved up for the real thing, and they are 100% better - I think you should just get a job or save pocket money, and it will feel so much better when you get the real thing.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	You can't.<br>  Fuggs aren't bad, the only bad thing is when people try and make them look real.<br>  It makes them look cheap.<br>  Just either wear the as fakes or get the real thing.<br>  <br>  The main thing that gives it away, is that they lean inwards, so walk properly.|`|PwHQSAxvaa	The genuine article is hideous enough, but at least it is high quality tat.|`|czAbrzcUaa	I saw one girl who wrote UGG on the back of hers in biro, don't do that.<br>  You can buy face UGG sticker type things on ebay.|`|oA5n28FAaa	U can actually if u look well enough.  I have Uggs and they brown chocolatey pair and im not actually sure if they real or fake as i was told they were fake when i gt told about them but the gal who sold them said they real but they look real as lots or ppl have asked me where myne are from as ppl think they look lovely and real but i think they actually from australia as she gt them abroad!|`|Gwtmvcmlaa	You swap them for some real ones :D<br>  Otherwise you can try nicking a label off a friend's and sewing them on|`|VEgv5NhSaa	You can't<br>  <br>  If their Fake, their Fake.<br>  <br>  They will always be fake<br>  <br>  <br>  * unless * you buy the real thing.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	Sell them on ebay and put the money towards some real ones.|`|d8EYaNw2aa	nope it is impossible somebody will always be able to tell that they are fake! Why do you want to know?|`|AA10453526	no|`|2QyAMsrfaa	u mad cheap.. just buy real ones|`|jQxlZP6paa	1) you cannot<br>  2) it does not matter if they are real or fake<br>  3) if friends think so get new friends<br>  4) if you are worried about it remember the style is you, be comfortable in both fake and real items.<br>  5) it is no ones business how you choose to spend your money-unless it's illegal of course.|`|4YjSx6Fyaa	you cant. <br>  <br>  unless you try and sew a fake label on, but then if someone see;s there gonna notice and you;ll just look stupid. <br>  <br>  buy next ones, theyre nicer, and have a label on the back, so it looks less cheap.|`|S6MQesQCaa	See infomation here:<a href="http://www.topabuy.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.topabuy.com</a>|`|AA12177562	make sure they are soft, slouchy,and at least suede.....remember fake's look good on the receipt, but maybe not on you!
FYiKgeN8aa	Lunges, lunges, and more lunges!  Try doing them with 3 lbs weights in each hand.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	CARDIO... anything that gets your heart beating fasts burns calories and sheds fat. to slim your thighs you need to loose more calories then you take in. there are 3500 calories in a pound so if you want to drop a pound a week you need to cut that many calories out of your weekly diet. overall this is a really reasonable goal. good luck
kFFgSZJ2aa	Have you thought about having her razor your ends? I have really long thick hair and that's what I have my lady do. It looks wonderful and makes the layers blend nicely.

J9raZzriaa	I have been there before. I don't know if you are a religious person but when I feel this way about anything, I take it to GOD.  I always ask GOD to guide and direct my foot steps. I tell GOD that I am confused about what I want to do or go. Note my answer don't come over night but it do come. The doors will start to open for me out of no where. <br>  <br>  Every time I start to feel confused before GOD answer, I just say to myself GOD please help me.<br>  I hope this helps you because it works for me.<br>  Good Luck!|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Honestly you have to think it through, imagine the possible outcomes of the good & bad to see if it's you, I rather do what I love than be miserable;)|`|h6cAhPs6aa	the best thing i did when i graduated was to take a year off to try to decide what i really wanted to do in life.  i took a small job as a receptionist,  i really didn't want to sit on my rump all the time.  so i have always liked the medical field.  in the medical field everyday is different.  and its a very interesting field. so i worked in clinic and hospitals and when i found out that i really love the medical field i became a nurse.  so sit down and think about what you really LOVE to do and you will be fine.  SIT DOWN AND THINK ABOUT IT AND THEN DECIDE.   and you will be fine|`|ydHU7gYIaa	oh geez, SO many times! ive gone from one career aspiration to another to another, and the only way i figured out what i truly wanted was by looking inside and actually outside as well. by that i mean that i stepped back at the things i did in my leisure time- what books i was reading, what tv shows i was watching, etc- and realized that i was so passionate about medicine, and thought of it as pleasurable, so i never even thought of it as being a possible job because i was under the impression  jobs werent meant to be "pleasurable". now i know that that was stupid, and have gone into medical school. for a long time i thought i wanted to be a professional model, and although i do still model occasionally, i found that it is great for the time being, on the side (although it does take a lot of work), but it is a very limited career and i would only be able to do it for a few years anyway. just take a step outside yourself and look at the things that you truly find fascinating. do you love fashion magazines? do you like shows about forensics or us history, etc etc? youll find your way if you listen to your heart|`|dyktmfg4aa	Yes, I have been. In fact, I changed my mind several times before college because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do - and that's ok.  In the end I decided to do what I loved - go to college to become an art teacher.  No, it will never pay well, and no, I don't care.  <br>  Some people chose their job based on money and other based on what they want to do.<br>  I will love my job and that's what I care about.<br>  Do what you love - and if you are not sure, go into college undecided and take a bunch of different classes!  Talk to your teachers and find your interests.  <br>  Take a social work class, history, math, art, spanish - educate yourself and find what you love!  It is a difficult talk, I know.  But you can do it! :) good luck.
AA11461724	i think it's a little short. you would probably see where the extensions are weaved/sewn/clipped/glued in. i had my hair cut that short once, i hated it but all i could really do was wear it. i had a really natural looking wig i wore every now and then, but that was it. i tried extensions too, you could see my clips and the short hair sticking out.|`|QjM16GBKaa	I just did the same exact thing! My hair is 3" long. I hate it! I called about extensions. It has to be 6". I went and got a wig. LOL I love it! I just wash my real hair, let it dry and put my wig on. I feel like people know though. I am self conscious about it. I don't care that much though. It's fun! You can get all kinds of hairdos. I am going to get another one soon. I can now have long hair without having to blow dry it straight. Yay! Prenatal vitamins will make it grow like crazy! Good luck!|`|AA10835302	2 - 3 inches is long enough but you might want to hold off on the extensions and try to just allow your hair to grow out.  Extensions put a lot of stress on the scalp and causes your real hair to fall out.  In many cases, hair can become very thin because hair follicles are unable to grow new hair due to excessive damage.  Give yourself 6 months, take vitamins, exercise, eat a diet well stocked with protein and good oils like omega 3, and take good care of the hair you have.  It should grow in no time.|`|63a5263489efd09b002b83caf0e1b446aa	yeah its way too short right now...you may need to do a wig...  mine is just now grown out to about 5-6 inches on the top layers and i can barely get the extesnions to look okay and the only reason they do is b/c my extensions are in layers to blend into my own hair...sorry but it seems you will need to grow it out some more b4 you can get the extensions|`|bjuSB8k6aa	u can still use hair extensions just as long as you get hair extensions that are not too straight if your hair is  layered.<br>  Get the right colour and clip them in right and im sure they would be ok. Styling the hair hair extensions and cutting them yourself might help them to blend in.

ddXQeEvNaa	I dye my hair black. First you have to make sure you're not  using too much dye, cause if you use too much the excess will wash out. 2nd switch to a shampoo with absolutely no sulfate, a lot of stuff says "color safe" but still has sulfate and isn't good enough for black hair. Leave your conditioner in a little longer, cause healthy hair is less likely to fade. If you want to go even further, pick up a bottle of semi-permanent haircolor from Sally's and mix it into your conditioner, then let it sit for 5-10 minutes a week to refresh it.|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	Well, that's really what you get with box dye. You could try a color safe shampoo and conditioner. I would definitely recommend getting it dyed black. It will last you so much longer, and probably make you alot happier.|`|bb2e6db0583b5e85ef4ab88cbbeba26baa	use permanent dye as it lasts PERMANTLY. All black dyes will fade though-there is nothing you can do about this.

zDJ26bktaa	16 with your parents, 19 without, some places are different, no reputable artist is going to risk their livelihood tattooing a minor.
tFoSy2YRaa	Ok, I'm a 32F, so I have your problem and then some!<br>  Some clothes that work for me: bootcut jeans with heels, skirts that flare out just slightly, fitted tops, lowish necklines (really high ones WILL make your chest look bigger, its true), wrap tops...just try on different things. My most flattering outfit is a scoop neck vest top with a 3 quarter length sleeved cropped cardigan - makes them look like a C sometimes! Don't wear lots of detail or patterns around your chest. <br>  Always wear good bras.<br>  have a look at bravissimo - they do clothes specially cut for big breasted girls|`|FBQOBhqIaa	Try maybe first getting a right bra fitting, then maybe it'll feel comfortable to suit your style;)|`|dyktmfg4aa	I have the same problem - kind of big boobs but a small waste.  I find that stright-across tanks look bad and baby dolls make me look pregnant, too!<br>  What I have found looks good are V-neck tops that are tighter around the waste.  Halters look good, too,  because you can kind of adjust how big the bust is.  Stores like Aero and American eagle make clothes for flat-chested girl and never look good on me.  <br>  Forever 21 is a good store, their clothes are made for more mature girls.  Good luck, I know it sucks sometimes but find the right clothes and you will look great.|`|qb01Zuseaa	I live in fl which is super hot & i wear bra size f with a very small waist,, i have the same problem buh i usually wear tanks there comfortable, cute and fitting.. i get the stretchy ones so that there tight at the waist and lose at the busts,, hope this helps|`|obE9Md17aa	no definatly not wear a dress. you need to duct tape those things down first|`|bFfWFsFWaa	Two things. I have huge boobs as well. Always look for halter tops with thick straps and tops that don't show a lot of clevage. <br>  <br>  Also, invest in taking a class in sewing or something. It sounds silly but if you learn how to tailor your own clothes it saves a lot of money and you're able to fix a lot of clothes for you. I thought this was a silly idea at first. But I'm 6'0, with decent sized hips, small waist and huge boobs. Society is constantly drilling into people a perfect look...BUT THEY NEVER PROVIDE CLOTHES FOR US WHO SUFFER FROM IT!!!!!!!! I have enough trouble finding clothes. My grandma showed me a few things then took me to classes to learn how to do it and let me tell you, being able to fix my own clothes are great. Go to a community collage for Home Economics. OR, go to a store like Joann Fabrics or Micheals or some place where they sell crafts and suing supplys and stuff. Typically they have classes there. Even if they don't or the classes arn't what you're looking for, they can give you names of people and places that could help!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit*  Also, you may want to go to stores that sell clothing to people who are overweight. Look in the departments for heavier people. You may not be fat, but you could perhaps find small sized tops in the heavy department that fit you. That's what I do. Usually I'm an Xtra large or larger in regular departments, but xtra small in heavy departments.

foGsTKpOaa	you could bleach it out or you could go to a salon and ask them to strip it out with bleach. but this depends on how light you want to go. if your hair is nearly black, it might take a long time before you can get to a certain point where you can dye it like blonde. i think they sell stripping/bleaching kits in stores but you might wanna let pros do it.|`|qUbJbu64aa	you have to bleach it out.

4fc129ccfffdb16cb2d28a6fe0c55cdeaa	You should skip school 2-3 days for the skin to close a bit around your pierce, not to mention not risking getting an infection if you take it out.<br>  <br>  Then, it is all a matter of how fast you can get the piercing out of your lip. you should practice taking it off and putting it back. A pocket mirror might be handy.<br>  <br>  Though rather risking it, you should wait for easter or summer break. this way it has more time to heal.|`|uQVbKCgKaa	I soo want my Lip peirced,i havent had it done yet.but you might want to keep it in for a few weeks,because i know it hurts when its still sore and you try to put it in.I've did that when i had my ears peirced before,and it hurts.But yeah my school allows Lip piercings =]..Which is awesome,and even if i wasent allowed to have it,i would still wear it,they wont be able to do anything to me.Anyways i hope this helps.!|`|KjVKNjwNaa	why in the world would you go against school policy?? wait until your out of high school then you can do what you want!  i can say from experience that its not good to take it out the first few weeks until its completely healed...infection may occur & then there will be alot of pain & problems!|`|6uYVRaebaa	worst that could happen is uit closing or infection....go for it if we cant change your mind lol why ask?|`|a9oABXhOaa	ugh my school is like that too.<br>  its a bunch of b*llsh*t !<br>  ha i honestly dont care what my school thinks. <br>  im getting my industrial and lips peirced so their gonna have to deal with it.<br>  hahaha =]|`|AA10873763	Wait until summer break.<br>  You'll want to leave it in for a few weeks while it heals.|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	They start closing pretty much straight away when new.

However, it clears up my dry skin almost overnight, and it won't make the situation worse or give you zits, so it's worth a try.|`|c5anDswjaa	I get dry flaky skin too, and what I do is get a black shirt and rub it all over my face to get all of that crap off..

c58a69c1e58034fe1ac3b379dcc20502aa	There can be a single reason, or a multitude.  Women have this problem, also, but typically on a smaller scale.  Below is some information that I pass to people now and again that I found does work.  Really.  I paid for this information, it works for me, and I pass it on.  I have no NO financial tie to any of the products or methods I describe below.  Good luck!!<br>  <br>  Below you will read of multiple approaches to tackling the dilemma of hair loss.  I personally went through a program that utilized nearly all of these techniques, all on-going at the same time.  That program cost me $1600 for the 6 month program.  Lucky you gets this info for FREE!<br>   <br>  First of all, either you need to have strong evidence of hair loss on yourself, or a fairly strong family history of it.  None of these products or techniques will grow thicker hair than you have historically had, nor will produce new hair in areas you never had hair before.  The sooner you begin, the greater & quicker the results.  Women generally see greater and quicker results.<br>   <br>  Disclaimer:  As with any product or technique, everyone has different and unique health predispositions.  Always consult a physician before undertaking any of these products or techniques if you have or may have a history of allergies to any, or are under a doctor's care utilizing over-the-counter or prescription drugs, as interactions (contraindications ) may occur which can be detrimental to your health.<br>  <br>  Internal:<br>  The herb of Saw Palmetto:  Generally suggested to men for prostrate health, women can take this herb with no complications.  This is taken as a DHT inhibitor.  DHT is the natural occurring hormone we produce to lose hair. <br>  Biotin:  This is from the B-Vitamin family.  It accelerates hair growth.<br>   <br>  External / Topical:<br>  Minoxidil:  Men - 5%, Women - not over 2%.  Found in most products (like Rogain) advertised for hair loss regrowth.  You can purchase it under it's true name - Minoxidil - through the internet (ebay).  Strong precautions in use of this product.  Once you take it,  it will become a part of your life, as if you decide to stop taking it, the hair will regain it's original state, and you will lose all of the hair you regained.<br>   <br>  Natural Shampoos & Conditioners:  Try the natural food or product stores.  These products will not build up on your scalp and "suffocate" the follicles.  I use the product Equalizing Shampoo by Hair Solutions (Step 1), 12 oz. (*NOTE) The Conditioner is under the name of Bio Harmonix Lite Rinse Conditioner with Sun Screen (Step 3), 10.6 oz. through LH Technologies, Boca Raton, Fl  33431, phone 888-446-3747. Then, (Step 2) is the Hair and Scalp Live Enzyme Cleanser, 11 oz. (*NOTE) The enzyme product will help to strip the old buildup off of the scalp and hair.  I originally used these products exclusively, but came across the product below that I use WITH the above mentioned Step1,2,3 products.  See explanation below.<br>  <br>  (*NOTE) The company I used was closed down or went out of business per BBB on May 2, 2006.  The products they sold are still available, though, thru the original distributor.  I was told that the products can be ordered via phone 1-888-446-3747 or the website:<br>  www.harmonixhairsolutions.com<br>  <br>  Conditioner:<br>  These are horse-care products that I have taken to replace using Minoxidil.  Have not looked back: It is called Mega-Tek Rebuilder, 16 oz.  By Eqyss Grooming Products.<br>  The outside of the bottle reads:  "Eqyss Grooming Product's Mega-Tek Equine Rebuilder. Thicker Fuller Longer Mane & Tails. Coat Blanket rubs disappear. Hoof..."It is labeled suitable for human use.  It re-grows hair on horses where tack can rub the hair off of the coat.<br>  Here is a direct link:<br>  <a href="http://www.shop.store.yahoo.com/eqyss-online/16ounmegreb.html">http://www.shop.store.yahoo.com/eqyss-on...</a><br>   <br>  I use the Eqyss Mega-Tek Rebuilder directly on my scalp every time I shampoo (2-3x per wk).  Then I place my regular conditioner on the hairs as they are distanced from the scalp. I leave it in while I finish washing, giving it some time to be absorbed. Then I rinse it out.  I have had no problems with it.  Some people elect to not wash the Eqyss conditioner out, but I do.  People have noticed that after a while the hair not only thickens, less hair evidenced going down the drain, but the hair can become "brittle" to the touch.  That is why I also utilize the other conditioner, and that has helped alleviate that for the most part, along with using the LaserComb.<br>   <br>  It's shampoo mate is called the Eqyss Premier Color Intensifying Shampoo  I believe that it is the same as their "Eqyss Premier Natural Botanical Equine Shampoo, Conditioner & Moisterizer, PH Balanced, Enhances Color, High Gloss & Shine" which is the exact reading on the bottle of the product I use. The size is 22 oz., and it runs around $16-18. I use it in conjunction with the conditioner - every time I wash my hair.<br>  <br>  Hairbrushes:<br>  Boar Bristle brushes are the most gentle, and tend to not break hair off.  A 100% boar bristle  brush may not be your preference, since it does not pull on the hair shaft, and to the inexperienced user, it is like turning the brush backwards and brushing with the handle portion - you feel like you are NOT brushing your hair...but with experience, you will learn the "touch and feel" of the bristles gliding through your hair.  It's that gentle.  You can instead elect to buy a brush that has nylon or other type bristles mixed with the boar bristle, but remember that you will continue to break off hairs using nylon or any other material.  The Boar Bristle brush not only keeps down the hair breakage, but it also more freely distributes the natural oils you have on your scalp.  If you wash your hair often, this will not be an issue.  It also will bring shine to your hair.<br>  There are new brushes out on the market that are "ion" based, using a negative charged plate attached to the brush to help keep static out of hair and keep natural moisture in the hair shaft.  I have not tried this product, so I can not testify as to it's merit.  I keep static out of my hairbrush by just running it under the water tap.  And remember to keep your brush clean and free from debris.<br>  In addition to "ion" brushes, there are also ionic hair dryers.  I did purchase an 850 watt travel dryer.  The manufacturer claims that the hair shaft will somehow not splinter or dry out; claims that the moisture will be somehow sealed back within the hair shaft.  In my experience, all I noticed is that the ionic dryers run incredibly hot-burning your scalp, if you aren't careful.  I would suggest NOT using an ionic dryer on children, the elderly, or anyone who can not adequately communicate with you that the dryer is causing them discomfort.  My hairdresser concurs with my observation.  Treat it as a very hot hairdryer, maintaining a generous distance from dryer to subject.  The further away, the better, and use to a minimum.<br>  And lastly, the most expensive product - and it DOES work:<br>  The Laser Comb.  It is a cool laser with a red diode that you gently, very very slowly comb across your scalp.  Usually 15 minutes a session for 2-3x per week.  Overuse will render it less effective, and it may begin to undo your hard work.  I have kept with the original Laser Comb company (Lexington HairMax) because I am confident with it's quality and integrity.  I purchased mine directly from the manufacturer, although you can bid for it on Ebay.  The laser comb will do this:  Thicken up your scalp (you will need to be patient - takes sometimes 3 full months before results are seen) and little baby fuzz will begin to grow, which will change over to small hairs, then fuller, longer hairs.  Next good thing about it is that your scalp will feel like it received a great stimulating massage.  It will feel tingly and warm like your scalp is "alive".  And the sensation can last almost a full day.  Another nice thing is that your hair will lighten up in color a bit, but it will begin to soften, become silky to the feel.  The hair will feel cooler to the touch, thicker, stronger, more manageable.  It will become more shiny and have the "healthy" look and glow that you see with children and teens hair.  I paid $600 plus shipping for mine when I purchased it Fall of 2003.  Here is your link to the one I own:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.lasercomb.net/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.lasercomb.net/default.aspx</a><br>   <br>  Filtered Water:  Some people elect to do a final rinse with purified water.  Some have special filters on their showerhead that remove chlorine and other chemicals.<br>   <br>  What do I use today?<br>  Lexington HairMax Laser Comb<br>  Boar Bristle Brush<br>  Eqyss Shampoo and Conditioner<br>  Harmonix' brand Shampoo & Conditioner and their Enzyme spray - periodically<br>  Saw Palmetto supplemental herb (a by-product of this herb is that it helps with depression, so I continue to use under that primary premise)<br>   <br>  My hair loss started slow.  I had to clean out the tub drain about every 6 months.  Then, I was having to clean it out every time I showered.  My hairdresser commented that I needed to change the part on my scalp because I was thinning on one side. Eek!  I began to count, yes count the hairs, and when I started the program, I would average 380 per washing, and now, maybe 80.  I stopped coloring my hair.<br>  I found a hair catcher basket at Home Depot that was made of latex rubber that could be placed over or inside the drain hole.  You may want to do that to monitor your progress.  Keep some beginning samples and set aside, then try a few after one month, two, three months.  You should notice a big change, determined by how severely you were loosing your hair. It starts as a little fuzz, like the down on a bird, then the hair folicle is baby fine, then it thickens to be like a regular shaft of hair.  You will see it starting to work when the "peach fuzz" ...see below|`|SMsprdMfaa	I would say not to use chemicals on your hair.Why don't you go for some home remedies. Egg whites, lemon juice, oil massages, reducing stress and diet changes can reduce hair fall and make it healthier.

Are you getting plenty of vitamin e? This actually prevents hair loss!<br>  <br>  I strongly advise you to consult a doctor about this; it's not normal for this to be happening to you if you are relatively young.|`|IIztioS3aa	the average person loses 80 strands of hair a day.<br>  <br>  it could be stress related. it could be unhealthy changes in your diet. it could be change of seasons. if your hair is curly and you don't brush it daily it could just be that your 80 strands for a few days are coming out all at once.<br>  <br>  sometimes when i need a hair cut i notice that i shed more. has it been a long time since your last one?<br>  <br>  good luck! if your really concerned about it mention it next time you see your doctor. or ask your hair stylist if your concerned about it. they might have some more ideas for you.|`|rg2qMxT5aa	drink protein drinks<br>  also go to dr.<br>  maybe be hereditary<br>  maybe be stress|`|aL2gQ1R8aa	Yes, it could be stress related because the same thing happened to me. I think you should see a doctor.|`|74769YPKaa	My dad had been suffering from hair loss and only recently he started to see a huge difference with his hair (lots of fine hair growing out especially at the temple area) after trying out the various natural techniques taught to grow hair for 1 week at this website <a href="http://www.regrowmyhair.info" rel="nofollow">http://www.regrowmyhair.info</a> <br>  <br>  I must say its a very informative, effective and easy to follow step-by-step guide.

B6cOlFU9aa	It doesn't sound like you are over washing, since you are only washing once or twice a day. Over washing is usually washing more than 3 or 4 times a day, because this will give you dry skin and break down your hair folicles, plus it will make you color fade faster (if you color your hair). Just make sure your shampoo is gentle enough for daily use, and you should be fine.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	Showering multiple times is ok, but washing your hair multiple times isn't. The products that are in shampoo and conditioner are only meant to go in your hair once a day (certain chemicals.) My suggestion would be only shampoo once/day, but if you take another shower, just use conditioner.|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Yes, your hair dries out from over washing and unless you have oily hair twice a week is recommended by hair salons. As for your body..if you play sports or sweat excessively you may need to take a shower more often or sponge off quickly in the shower. Just remember to use a good shower gel with cocoa-butter and cocoa-butter lotion when you get out. There are so many pollutes in the air that we need to keep our skin moisturized and protected with sunscreen daily. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T
vVka4ZA0aa	If you're having an issue with cellulite, you need more cardio in your diet to help shed the excess fat.<br>  Also toning with some exercise like yoga and pilates will help reduce cellulite.<br>  You try a Celluloss type dietary supplement or cellulite creams, but to get the best effect, you really need a better diet along with exercise. You can try the surgical route, but unless you get into a healthier routine, it's only going to come back.

They are a little expensive, but they are the best!|`|kHLwlNA5aa	Instead of worrying about what you feel you don't have, why not emphasize those things that you feel you do have. Big boobs aren't the focal point. Remember that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Why try to be fake and someone who you're not.|`|RTojCgVPaa	go to victoria's secret and get a push up swimsuit. yes they do have them and they rock because they sell the miracle bra swimsuit (you can get it online too) and you can pick your size and color that you like and have it shipped or you can go to your local store. they work really well.|`|vPkAjWoJaa	Well I'm no swim suite expert but I'm sure you are pretty young lady. Just remember to be confident in yourself the more you are negative towards your size, the more people will realize it because of "the law of attraction." If you bring negative to yourself then you will get negative if you bring positive to yourself and others then positive will happen. Good luck with this and remember if guys don't want to date you because of your cup size then they aren't worth dating right.|`|pA1M2HSoaa	of course there id! suprising as it may seem, alot of girls are flat. they make swimsuits with inserts to make you look more 'proportionate'. just go to wherever you buy your bathing suits and ask an employee to help you out :) best of luck. also the padding can be gel or cloth inserts|`|IYjAD0dyaa	okay well get bathing suits with bold prints and bold colors . Bandeau tops only put emphasis on small chests so that's a no-no. <br>  Look for decoration on the top where the bust is. The more "intricate" the top part is, the more proportioned you will look. Look for sweetheart, V-neck, or scoop necklines. There are some lightly padded bra suits, but be careful. You don't want to look like a 12-year-old who's stuffed their top.<br>  <br>  example: <a href="http://store.delias.com/item.do?categoryID=1750&itemID=48856&sizeFilter=&colorFilter=&brandFilter=" rel="nofollow">http://store.delias.com/item.do?category...</a><br>  <br>  with the outline of the bust it makes it look like you have one.
