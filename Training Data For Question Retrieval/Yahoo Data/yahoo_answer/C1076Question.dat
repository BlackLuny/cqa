He's been playen pretty consistantly, getten about 7 passes a week... Going by Welker and Chamber's recent #'s, I'd just take one of em out, and put in Bowe...

The thing is, Gore is battling a sprained ankle, so it's a tough call... Any feedback on these to sitch's is appreciated

Why do the best gunsmiths drill screwholes slightly under the minor size of the screw tap (say .009 or so) before using the tap?      2.)  If baking lacquer makes too dull a finish, how should it be brought to a tough, bright shine? Is there any additional step needed other than buffing? What is the biggest caution other than safety regarding quality?      3.) Other than 100% buffing, what other method is used to remove pits and scratches from a barrel prior to blueing?      4.) You have to lightly grind a receiver but don’t have a grinder. Can you do it with your drill press? How? Any concerns in doing this?      5) Re-crowning a barrel with shallow rifling often causes chatter. How can you prevent this, and what usually causes it?      6) If you can’t find an action wrench for a rifle with a flat bottomed action, such as a Mauser, how can you work on the action?      7.) How do you remove a grip screw caught in it’s bushing (assuming they are both outside the gun) without drilling or destroying either piece?
20090131094008AASdZSt	Sports;Martial Arts	Do you think this would be a good motivator?	Excitement and spirit s lacking in my kids  karate class right now because of the bad weather. Normally I hold classes outside but in temperatures below freazing thats not possible for small kids so were stuck in a small place with limited options for advanced training. so I thought I would create a competition. Where I would divide the class into two teams and then every class they can earn points by achieving goals (preforming a kata by themselves) and loose points by forgetting gear and not coming to class. and then in 1 month the group with the most points wins (i was thinking an extra stripe for their belt which counts as 20 pushups credit for the winners and the other team would get rising sun head bands but i wouldn't tell them the prizes.)      But for the groups I thought I would do white- through orange belts (7-8) with goals like      do 25 pushups in a row   do a kata by themselves   come to a sparing class    enter a  practice tournament   lead exercises 1 day   make a poster to help advertise the class   practice journal with 3 days a week of 15 minutes outside of class (signed by parents)      for the green- purple (10-12 year olds)   enter a tournament (just points for going)   join demo team   help a younger student with their kata   do 50 pushups in a row   lead  the class through a kata   come up with t shirt ideas   practice journal 5 days a week 20 minutes or more outside of class(signed by parents)      then have like  weakily things like award points to the group with the most spirit, to the group who brought all materials to class. But kind of work on some confidene, and enthusiasm boosting. Should I just stop this idea right now?

20090131100526AAzwMJy	Sports;Martial Arts	How do I get a personal fighting/defense instructor?	I've always wanted to learn how to fight. Not because I like to fight, but because it will help me to feel more secure in my day-to-day rather then so helpless. I'm not talking self defense like what we see on tv and I'm not talking cage style fighting. I am a women and I want to fight like a women. I may not have a man's strength, but I am small, agile, and I could use my brain. The best example of this is in the movie 'Enough' with Jennifer Lopez. She has a personal trainer and learns how to fight, defend, and all by excepting that she is a women-- no drugs and bulky muscles. Where can I find a trainer like the one she had? Where can I even start to look? Remember, I'm not talking just self defense, I'm talking about fighting back.

David Lee won the MVP as a Sophomore in that game and his teammates were CP3, D.Will, and Granger - that was a sick team and D.Lee was sick and stole the show. Dunks left and right 30 points, 14/14 for the field, and he grabbed 9 boards 2.      Does Wilson Chandler - who is having a sick Sophomore season have a chance @ Sophomore MVP? Also, David Lee should be in the dunk contest instead of Nate. Not only is Lee the better all-around player. But, he is also a better all-around dunker. Nate gets the benefit of the doubt cause of his height and he missed a lot of dunks the year he won. Lee finishes from further and because he is ambidextrous can finish w/ both hands. David Lee beat James White, a sicker dunker in the McDonald's All-star High-school game Classic - in the dunk contest.

Despite her great career which spanned over 15 years, former 3XWWE Champion and 1XAWA champion Madusa Miceli, sometimes known as Alundra Blayze will be unfortunately most remembered for the infamous belt dumping incident on Nitro in 1995.  Many fans remain incensed to this day over what she did; some really have gone off the rails. These are my questions:      1. Should Madusa return the belt to WWE?      2. Which of the following, if any, does she owe an apology:      1. Vince McMahon;   2. The WWE fans who supported her;   3. Bull Nakano and the late Bertha Faye who also wore that belt as woman's champion?      My answer: She is long overdue returning the belt;      1. Believer me I hate to say this but she owes Don Vinnie an apology   2. The Fans   3. Bull and Bertha--she dissed them as former champions big time like they were nothing winning a nothing belt--of course, they beat her to do it; Nakano practically kicked her azz.

20081023115351AAsjU65	Sports;Basketball	Kobe and the 2008 NBA GM poll...?	For those of you who don't know, the NBA releases a poll of standard questions to the 30 GMs in the league.  You can find the 2008 poll here:         http://www.nba.com/2008/tipoff/10/21/gms...       Now, regardless of your personal feelings of Mr. Bryant, doesn't this GM poll establish him as the best player in the league right now?  I mean, when the GMs of other teams pick Kobe as number 1 in three different categories (and overwhelmingly so), isn't this the most objective standard to prove that Kobe is the current best player in the NBA?      I'll award the best answer for the most thorough response.  If you disagree with me, by all means, do so -- but regardless of your answer, I want to see some rationale behind the response.      Which player is the best at getting his own shot?   1. Kobe Bryant - 81.5%      Which player in the NBA would you want taking a shot with the game on the line?   1. Kobe Bryant -- 88.9%      Who is the best on-the-ball defender in the NBA?   1. Kobe Bryant -- 26.9%   
20090131132733AAGuqJF	Sports;Football (American)	Who else could care less about this year's Superbowl?	Arizona and Pittsburgh? Really? Match-ups like this make me understand why the BCS is used in college. Seriously, a 9-7 team vs. the most boring football team ever. The Cardinals are hot, but right underneath that skin of fortune is the fact that they really are average at best. The Steelers have no offense and often relied on luck and their defense/st to win games. I'd rather watch a root canal. I hope there is something on tomorrow better than this crap.

20090131142638AArpiQ6	Sports;Football (American)	What do you think of my 2009 NFL mock draft?	This is more for fun than anything. I tried to be realistic, but I also used what I feel like is the best football logic.      1: Detroit Lions      Matthew Stafford, QB, Georgia      The QB carousel in Detroit will end this year. Although I disagree with this pick, I can’t blame the Lions for trying to get a franchise QB to lead them. It worries me that Stafford could bust due to the not so great line he’ll be playing behind, and lack of a supporting cast. He does have a few pieces in Kevin Smith, MEGATRON, and Gosder Cherilus, but leading this team will be on his shoulders. I sincerely hope the Lions don’t end up with David Carr V.2.      Alternate pick: Eugene Monroe, the best offensive tackle in this draft in my opinion. Would shore up the left side of the line to help the run game and protect whatever QB is thrown into the fire.      2: St. Louis Rams      OT, Eugene Monroe, Virginia      Alex Barron is terrible, and Orlando Pace’s knees are shot. Monroe can come in and start on either side of the line day 1 and be an improvement. He’s a good pass blocker and a pretty good run blocker, so he’d help in both aspects of the game. It all starts in the trenches, and this would be the right pick.      Alternate pick: Michael Crabtree, WR, Texas Tech      St. Louis, in my eyes, has always been a sort of glitz and glam team. Bringing in Crabtree along with Holt and Avery(who will be a franchise wideout, no doubt in my mind) would bring excitement to this franchise again, having a nice triplet of wide receivers and a talented RB if he can stay healthy. Could bring new life to Bulger and make this team have a potent passing attack. Crabtree can play in the slot and then move outside once Holt retires.      3: Kansas City Chiefs      Before I tell you who I picked, let me just tell you this pick gave me a ton of trouble.      Duke Robinson, OG, Oklahoma      With Pioli coming in, he wants to start fresh. That likely means getting rid of Brian Waters for fresh blood. Albert could still be moved inside, but I think they’ll keep him at tackle and take a guard. It all starts in the trenches, and I feel like Thigpen will be a franchise quarterback. This would be a good step in building a line to help protect Thigpen. He might need some technique work to get better at pass blocking, so he might not be great for protecting Thigpen all the time in that aspect, but he can protect Thigpen by helping the run game to produce.      Alternate pick: Andre Smith, Alabama      Move Albert inside or to right tackle and then you have a franchise left tackle, and guard or right tackle. I don’t know how the current right tackle is, but if nothing else, move Albert to right tackle, take Smith and move the right tackle inside in place of Brian Waters and maximize the effectiveness of the O-line.      4: Seattle Seahawks      Michael Crabtree, WR, Texas Tech      No playmakers at the wide receiver position for the Seahawks, so this seems like a consensus pick. Crabtree is a guy who doesn’t have elite timed speed, so I don’t know if he can uncover at the pro level. I see Crabtree as a guy who could easily bust, especially in Seattle. I like Crabtree, I really do, but the only other receiving threat is John Carlson at tight end. With that, Crabtree could end up being double covered and not being very productive as there are no other receiving threats. He could help open it up for other receivers just due to his presence, but he would still be looked at as a bust if he doesn’t produce himself.      Alternate pick: William Moore, S, Mizzou      This would definitely be a stretch, but let’s be honest, Brian Russell is awful. Just awful. William Moore may well be the best safety in this draft, he may not be, I don’t know. But I do believe he would be the second best pick for Seattle here.      5: Cleveland Browns      Aaron Curry, LB, Wake Forest      McGinest has a good chance of retiring, and Andra Davis is going to be a free agent. Kamerion Wimbley is a bust. The Browns have a good offense, but their defense not so much. A lot of drafts have them taking Malcolm Jenkins, but a good front 7 can make a back 4 better. Ask Antonio “I’m a product of Shawne Merriman” Cromartie. Having an improved pass rush would definitely make everyone on the defense better, and Curry can play the run as well. A lot of people consider him more of an ILB prospect in the 3-4, but I think he can play outside.      Alternate pick: Beanie Wells, RB, Ohio State      Lewis is getting a little long in the tooth. Wells is a very talented back, and he’s a local product. He could become a face of the franchise along with Brady Quinn, and be an exciting triplet with Quinn and Edwards(if Edwards gets over his case of the dropsies).      6: Cincinnati Bengals      Beanie Wells, RB, OSU      A local prospect who’s very talented. He could become the face of the franchise which doesn’t have a whole lot of positive things going for it. They also need a runningback, Benson looked like he did well down the stretch, but really, he averag

20081008184820AA4M1PO	Sports;Volleyball	How to ref a vball game, help needed now?	Okay, I am reffing a volleyball game tomorrow. I really want to try it and I am also planning on taking a course on how to ref pretty soon. However, I've never been a referee before. It's only a Juniors game so it won't be too hard I hope.      So, all I have to call is:   - obvious double hits   - a ball not making it over the net   - 4 hits   - throws/catches      - people being in the net?   - foot faults when serving?   - lifts/carries?      At the beginning of a game when do I call the captains? Whenever?      Then when I flip a coin and whoever "wins" gets to pick if they want to serve, does the other team then have the option of what side to play on?        After this set, the other team gets the serve, and so on, right?      Then, who gets 5 minutes of hitting first and does it matter what side they are on?       It's 5 minutes of hitting, and 1 minute serving, right? For each team? So there is a total warm-up time of 12 minutes?      What do I do to make the game start (to make the players run to shake hands)?      During the game, I blow the whistle briefly, indicate whose point it is, then indicate why. When the game ends, subs, or time outs, the whistle should be louder, right?      They have one minute time outs and 8 seconds to serve?      Other than that, I need to be really attentive, no day dreaming, correct? ;)      Any tips or corrections are very very much appreciated!!

Terrel Owens Vs St. Louis    Laveranues Coles Vs Oakland   Calvin Johnson Vs Houston   Marques Colston Vs Carolina      I am leaning towards starting Owens, Coles and Johnson. Carolina's D is pretty solid and Colston is coming off an injury even though I know he is a featured reciever. Do you agree with my choice? Let me know what your thoughts are. Thanks!

20081027203350AAd6oJ8	Sports;Other - Sports	I really don't like cheerleading anymore.?	Hi...   I really really wanted to try out for cheerleading. So i did. I really really liked it at first. Then it started getting too serious, and now i hate it. I have no friends on the team, the coaches are extremely not understanding and rude, and I really wish that i had known from the beginning that they were fake. I injured myself and they yelled at me. The other girls don't act like it's a team and they are all extremely cliqueish. I just don't want to do it anymore, it's ruining my life because i have better things to be doing. And i'd rather quit than make up different excuses for every practice. So what do you think I should do? Thanks.

A lot of people have been saying the Nadal-Verdasco match was one of the best matches ever in the history of tennis, and I agree. It was amazing to watch and really inspiring. Verdasco fought hard and showed brilliant skill (90+ winners!) but Rafa fought equally hard and prevailed. Not to discredit the AO semifinal, but I think that the Roger and Rafa show during Wimbledon was the best match ever.. the all-time greatest tennis match. I mean come on, it was the final of Wimbledon.. between the two greatest players alive... they were both fighting for records.. that amazing fifth set... it was an epic, epic match.

20090131110918AAGxS23	Sports;Wrestling	What if a scewjob, involving The Undertaker, happened at Wrestlemania? *more inside*?	Okay, we all love The Undertakers streak, and i believe that it was pretty obvious, after 12-0, it would never end. So, what if a scewjob like thing happened at Mania and the result was Taker being screwed out of his streak? Vince wanted to end the streak, but never told The Undertaker. And The Undertaker was screwed out of his streak, just like Bret Hart was screwed in Montreal. I'd hate for this to happen, but lets say Vince went behind Takers back, and got someone like Triple H to end it, do you think this is possible? I can never see it ending, ever, i can only see it ending though through a screwjob type thing.      Granted, Taker is willing to end it for anyone, (eg, he offered to end it for Orton, but Orton declined out of respect for Taker), but what if happened? What if The Undertaker was screwed out of his Streak, how would you react? How would Wrestling fans react? Your thoughts? I know this will probably never happen, but what if it did?      PS; The Undertaker = Greatness tbh :)      Thanks.

20090131105253AAk5SvM	Sports;Basketball	Jason Thompson on a comeback tour?	After the Kings fired Theus, the new coach, Natt, did not put much stock in Thompson, he cut his playing time and did not play him in important situations. But it seems since the middle of January that has changed, and since he started playing Thompson more, he has flourished. In the last ten game he has averaged 15.2 ppg, 7.8 rpg, 1 apg, and .5 bpg. In those games he also averaged 87% from the free throw line and almost 59% from the field. He did this averaging 30 minutes per game.       My question is, if Thompson continues to get these minutes, will he continue to put up these numbers; and if Brad Miller gets traded, will Thompson get more time and put up even better numbers?

20090131110328AAIIN95	Sports;Basketball	What can be done to improve the officiating in basketball?	I've watched and played a lot of basketball. Everywhere, at every level, officiating is one of the most frustrating things about the game for players and fans. In my experience, basketball truly is the hardest of the major sports to officiate (with American football second). Although there is a lot of misinformation among fans about what the rulebook says, there is seemingly "callable" contact on every play with what actually gets called varying from ref to ref and from game to game. People who play officiated basketball, in my experience, always feel 'wronged' by the officials, claiming that they never see what really happens.      Take the NBA for example. Officials are paid good money to be impartial and perform at a high level, but mistakes are still made in every game. What can be done about this?
