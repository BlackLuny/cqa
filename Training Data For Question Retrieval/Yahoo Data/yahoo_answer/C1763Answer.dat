5bce13acdb24903c787f259062abd973aa	I think anybody with a heart grieves the loss of innocent human life, whether it be Israeli or Arab or otherwise. I wouldn't agree with the statement that the Israeli's have "all the sympathy in the world". I think there are a lot of great people in Israel, but I strongly question some of the actions of the Israeli government (and now so are the Israeli people). And if "all the people in the world" are sympathetic to the Israeli's, where do the Arabs fit into that picture? I've noticed that no matter how hard any news media source tries to be unbiased they just can't help it simply because they are human (the personnel) and have their own perspective on the way the world works. I think you do have a point, but I also don't think its as bad as you say.|`|AA10489318	It is because of the policy of the Muslim people as a whole.  They are divided and fight amongst themselves.

Hay otras pobres muchachas que cometen un error o son forzadas a tener relaciones sexuales. La despenalización del aborto no aboga por MAS abortos, simplemente por mejores condiciones para las personas que decidan tomar ese camino. Es como el condón que no garantiza más relaciones sexuales, sino simplemente protección. <br>  En el caso del aborto, con toda la polémica moralista de si se está dando luz verde para que se cometa "homicidio"...el tema pasa simplemente por asumir que el problema EXISTE... o sea mis adorados, con o sin pena para el aborto se van a seguir realizando miles o millones de abortos al anio. Y es una realidad que no se puede cambiar con discursos baratos, ni posturas moralistas...ni rasgándonos las vestiduras. La única diferencia será la capacidad de estructurar un marco de ayuda a estas mujeres (QUE SI, mis queridos buenos cristianos, también son seres humanos y la necesitan) y que tengan la opción de además de realizarse el procedimiento en condiciones adecuadas, se les informe sobre el tema y de alguna manera sepan en lo que se están metiendo para tomar una decisión conciente.<br>  Está comprobado que el aborto en países en que es legal, ni ha aumentado, ni ha disminuido...por lo que es absurdo y pacato pensar que la despenalización lo aumentará.|`|NTIdXvAoaa	pues la vdd yo si estoy a favor EN ALGUNOS CASOS:<br>  estaba leyendo en periódico las diferentes razones por las que se puede practicar el aborto, algunas eran razonables, por ejemplo "en caso de que peligre la vida de la mujer o del bebe"...

El aborto si es por causas justificadas lo encuentro perfectamente legal y son muchas las "causas justificadas" no sólo la violación, también la malformación del feto, el peligro para la madre o hasta la incapacidad de poder criar a ese hijo, esta última es muy cuestionable, ya que muchas, se lo pueden tomar como una norma, "no tomo precauciones y si me quedo embarazada lo pierdo y ya está" que bonito. En Espa?a hay clínicas de Planificación Familiar que lo practican, en cualquiera de los casos anteriores, eso sí, llevan un control muy estricto y en cuanto hay una repetidora toman medidas.

I doubt they're parents or teachers would tell them to act kindly towards the Palestinians, or sympathize with them.

When the games resumed last week, the fans had come up with a new chant: “Why have the schools in Gaza been shut down?” sang the crowd. “Because all the children were gunned down!” came the answer.<br>  <br>  Aside from its sheer barbarism, this chant reflects the widespread belief among Israeli Jews that Israel scored an impressive victory in Gaza — a victory measured, not least, by the death toll.<br>  <br>  Israeli pilots and tank commanders could not really discriminate between the adults and the children who hid in their homes or huddled in the UNRWA shelters, and yet they chose to press the trigger. Therefore, it is not at all surprising that the lethal onslaught left 1,314 Palestinians dead, of which 412 — or nearly one third of all of the casualties — were children.<br>  <br>  We emphasize the Palestinian children because so many of them have been killed and terrorized in the past month. Yet it is clear that Israeli children are suffering as well, particularly those who have spent long periods in shelters for fear of being hit by rockets.<br>  <br>  The one message that is being conveyed to children on both sides of this fray is that the other side is a bloodthirsty monster. In Israel, this was instantly translated into gains for the hate-mongering Yisrael Beytenu party headed by the xenophobic Avigdor Lieberman, who is now the front-runner in mock polls being held in many Jewish high schools, with the hawkish Binyamin Netanyahu coming in second.<br>  <br>  Hatred, in other words, is the great winner of this war. It has helped mobilize racist mobs, and as the soccer chant indicates it has left absolutely no place for the other, undermining even basic empathy for innocent children. Israel’s masters of war must be happy: the seeds of the next wars have certainly been sown.

And that devalues the money already in circulation. That causes inflation and makes the recession worse. Worthless money was what started the recession in the first place.|`|YTasscmKaa	Because that leads to what they call "inflation" and that means the more money you print, the less its worth. Look it up. In Zimbabwe you need a wheel barrow full of money to get a loaf of bread.

So sad isn't it?  |`|7Zwp1dswaa	Well... I'll try to keep this simple. Money is NOT paper. Yes it's made of paper, but what it really is in short is a promise note saying "This note is guarenteed by X amount of gold" though it has been a long while since people exchanged it direct with the government. The problem with printing money is that the amount of gold backing the dollar really didn't change, so this would mean the buying power per dollar actually drops. Lets say you have $1 worth of gold backing one $1 note. Now you print another one. Now there is $1 worth of gold trying to back $2 worth of money, so in reality, your $1 is now worth only $0.50 cents. Shop prices will rise to reflect this, hence "inflation". Randomly printing money without anything to back it is a dangerous game, see the Japanese WWII "Banana Notes".|`|T4ke8qhsaa	That will result to uncontrolled inflation where the Dollar will become mere tissue paper.

GDwMdfqjaa	Further supporting what paperback has stated, as a Jewish person myself and one with several hundreds of Jewish friends, I've yet to see a Jewish person who sees himself as a victim or uses the holocaust to portray himself as such. Nor is it used to expain actions in the present. As a matter of fact, the only times I've seen anyone using the holocaust as a jumping board to playing a victim, it was people who claim Jews are using it to portray themself as victims. I'm still trying to find who are those mysterious hidden-in-the-shadows Jews they are talking about, because I've yet to see any.<br>  <br>  The only thing Jewish people still hold from the holocaust is the powerful phrase "Never again". 6 million Jews died because even when it was obvious there's someone who wants to wipe them out, they didn't take it seriously and took no action against it. <br>  <br>  Never again.<br>  <br>  If someone makes speeches talking about his desire to kill Jews or erase Israel, we'll be wary. If someone actually puts it as an agenda and begins working on it, like Hamas does by taking aggressive measures in every possible opportunity, we'll respond. Simple, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Edit: My bad, missed that part.<br>  As for - "Dark Al- don't get out much?" - Read in the beginning where I stated I  base my information on several hundreds of Jewish friends I have. I suggest you try to develop a sense of logic prior to giving comments so you'll actually have some connection between the two. Let me know how that works out for you.<br>  <br>  Edit 2: I was simply stating a fact. If having a couple hundred of people you've met throughout life and you're on good terms with is something so miraculous for you, perhaps it is you who needs to get out more.|`|6Lcn1aLsaa	If you live in Britain you will see that it is Muslims who claim they are the victims.

Wait till their numbers are larger in the USA it will happen there then.<br>  i heard of students who are moving college in England because of harrassment and bullying by Muslims over Gaza.They victimised anyone who would not give them money to send to Hamas.|`|InW0bIkwaa	So, the muslims living in Gaza are victims but only if they are killed by Israeli retaliation to Hamas rockets?<br>  <br>  So, what you are saying is that it is ok for Hamas to use women and children as human shields?  And that it is only ok for people to shoot back at the wimpy worthless pieces of garbage Hamas militants when they come out from behind their human shields?|`|N1isny2oaa	Nations never stop pursuing the Jews and this will go on until Jesus comes back. And that is because whether or not we believe or not Jesus is real and so is his Prophesy.  Satan will never stop trying to wipe out the Jews and he uses the world powers to do so.  Every time  we get rid of One Hitler another is there to take his place.  So no we don't see ourselves as victims our enemies wants us never to rest.<br>  <br>  Smooches<br>  <br>  WonderWoman|`|BCRNnk8Gaa	the way I see it, if someone beats up your mom, will you not retaliate?|`|mjE08gVNaa	You've answered your own question- history has proven that they were and are victims!

The Holocaust is a remembrance for that to not happen again, Never Again!<br>  <br>  That means that we defend ourselves and I personally do it vehemently. :) I'm a woman too, and if someone messes with me physically I'm going to kick *** without smearing my eyeliner and take names later!  So can you complain to me that "because I'm a woman wearing eyeliner" therefore I must have some complex that means I cannot defend myself?  Oh why stop there?  Let's go back to some childhood trauma that you think I might have had and then say oh that's why she defends herself so vehemently.  Screw the people that want to get in the head of people that defend and the actions required to defend and bring up some old event and say that they are overgeneralizing and projecting it onto the current event.  The point is, we DO defend and we're going to continue to defend ourselves vehemently against any attack and what was then was then, we learned from it, and we're onto a very difficult current event as these people have declared war on us and want to "itbach al yahoud" down to the very last one, and we are not going to remain passive and let that occur and screw the people that think otherwise:<br>  America and Israel will be annihilated and kill them all down to the very last one. -- Sheik Ahmad Bahr, Palestinian Leglislative Council, Acting Speaker Iran TV, 6/15/07<br>  The annihilation of the Jews is one of the most splendid blessings for Palestine. -- Muhsen Abu 'Ita, Hamas Cleric, Hamas TV 10/15/08<br>  Hamas In Their Own Voices<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_sg." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i08L09V0_...</a><br>  <br>  As far as the Muslims claiming victim status they do it all over the place and they have a propaganda campaign set up for them to "push" their victim card like it's a drug and they're the dealers and some unsusupecting fools lapped it up.  Did you know they're pushing victim status with Bashir in Sudan? ----><br>  <br>  Iran's Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki has condemned the recent arrest warrant for the Sudanese President as 'politically motivated'. Mottaki said in a Thursday meeting with the Sudanese parliament speaker Ahmed Ibrahim al-Tahir that certain political reasons including the 'disintegration' of Sudan were behind the arrest warrant for the President Omar Hassan al-Bashir. Iran's Foreign Ministry Spokesman Hassan Qashqavi on Thursday condemned the ICC's move, calling it "unjust!". Qashqavi said.<br>  <a href="http://www.rushmoredrive.com/LatestNews/Iran_Bashir_ICC_case_politically_motivated.aspx?ArticleId=10743089630825686780" rel="nofollow">http://www.rushmoredrive.com/LatestNews/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  They will continue to play victim and push that card as long as people buy it and it helps them in the political realms. There is a distinct axis and the people that support Hamas are also allied up with Syria and Iran and Bashir over there in Sudan who are spreading their global hegemony and are actually making victims out of indigenous peoples to kill themselves for their greater cause.<br>  <br>  Iran launched a "Digital Intifada" and is known as the "nation of bloggers" and people really need to look harder towards the global scheme of things as this conflict is much wide than the Gaza war.  <br>  <br>  "The Digital Intifada" Promises to Fight Zionism Online<br>  <a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128527" rel="nofollow">http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/N...</a><br>  <br>  Iran during the Iran Iraq war sent thousands of her Persian children into the Iraqi minefields so theycould clear it for the adult soldiers to pass.  Those children were armed with "plastic keys to paradise" and if that nation can do that to their own children there is no limit to what they will do with the rest of us.<br>  <br>  It makes your support for Gaza war CHICKEN FEED to what they plan on doing with the rest of our lives.  There is a greater cause than what you are considering, and militarily, the loss of civilian lives in conflict has to be lessor than the military strategic gain.  In our particular case, it was.  There are 1million residents of Southern Israel being shelled by over 10,000 rockets and 1.4million residents in Gaza that need liberation from their fascist dictators that rule over them.  Globally, we are all fighting against Islamofascism that is making it's move for global dominion.  You my dear, as a resident in the Western world, are playing right into their Islamofascist hands.

That poor mom trying to care for 6 kids at her age.  She looks exhausted.   Octomom will take the money that people are sending to her for the kids and probably have liposuction and skin reduction with the money.  Why can't someone do something to stop this weirdo.  Those kids are going to die if she is left with them.  I feel so strongly about this whole thing.  Lets hope someone does something.  And who is paying the cost of the hospital for all those babies?  The taxpayers as usual.  What a pain.|`|cPuicv06aa	How shocking!!  I'm sure the agency will have to look into this situation now.  This is really crazy!|`|hfodUPg9aa	That women is an irresponsible lunatic. I have never heard of such ridiculousness in all my life. Why should she be allowed to screw up eight more lives in her selfish, vain, and twisted world. No job! 14 kids (through in vitro fertilization), lives with her parents in a three bedroom home and spent most of the money that the government gave her not on her kids but on PLASTIC SURGERY to look like Angelina Jolie. I hope that a rich wonderful person would come forward and offer to adopt those children.  She needs a team of psychiatrists the poor thing.|`|mhvb9eFkaa	Once she signs the $1M porn deal, she won't need it!

Art comes in many forms but I my opinion this it not art. I am revolted by the entire idea. Skinning human beings and putting their dead bodies on display can be justified to train doctors but certainly no for "art".|`|CmG8oTH0aa	It is an absolutely fantastic exhibition.  The most informative and educational expo that I've ever attended.<br>  <br>  Every child was completely engaged and fascinated by the science of the Human body.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So when are you holding the witch trials and have you condemned Galileo to death yet?|`|dGiYVfw6aa	Hugo Chavez has also taken control over the media in Venezuela. He wants to silence anyone talking against him. And he just changed their constitution so that he can run for president as long as he wants to . That means he will "win" all the elections for the next 40 years, or however long he lives. Just think, he came out the other day and invited Obama to follow in his socialist footsteps.<br>  Chavez will probably keep the bodies and the owners won't be able to do anything about it. Except give Venezuela a bunch of Money. But Chavez wants to be "ethical". Yeah right. <br>  <br>  The exhibition came through Dallas a couple of years ago. It is fascinating. The people donated their bodies for the exhibit.

I mean with Obama trying to wrap up this Iraq thing, won't our military be bored out of their minds if we don't?|`|8bGHFpsnaa	North Korea is smart enough not to make a dumb move such as that.  They will definitely not shoot nukes because they know the USA can outgun them and crush them.  They just are trying to strike fear into the free world by getting us on edge, so that we submit to them out of fear.  Nope, no war; we do need to go to war with them thought but it just will not happen any time soon.
9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	One is saying something about science the other is saying something about the funding of such research.  Two different things.<br>  Researchers have found that adult stem cells are having good results while embryonic stem cells have had very poor results so I doubt that Obama has any understanding of the science.<br>  Former President Bush was right about using federal dollars for this or any research.  Private funding is much preferable.  Therefore, I agree with Former President Bush.|`|4bqm1zTCaa	Embryonic stem cells have helped absolutely NOTHING while adult stem cells have helped around 90 diseases so far.

What you got were Bush's lies and propaganda. Leave North Korea alone, it won't do you any harm to stay in the USA, nice and quiet instead of waging war on another country yet again.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	just wait and see|`|N8wNmQShaa	The only threat Iraq is to us, is a failing Government. We have started the process of removing troops from Iraq, and hopefully for a good reason.<br>  <br>  Don't you think it's kind of ironic we decide to bring 12,000 troops home a day before North Korea threatens us with War, it might be worse than what the media knows.<br>  <br>  Also, last time they fired a test missile, it landed just short of Hawaii... if they had one with longer range... it could possibly hit the West Coast. If that is the case, we need to take IMMEDIATE action.<br>  <br>  I'm hoping they action do send a satellite into space, and not fire a long range missile. But if that missile does get fired, immediate action has to happen.<br>  <br>  At least, other countries would be backing us this time, and not against us physically or believing we are wrong.|`|AA10153636	Yes we should take action..<br>  We should be prepared if they launch a rocket, and do nothing if it really is a satellite launch..   <br>  We don't need any new wars.<br>  Japan is the one that should worry as N Korea always launches over their heads and they don't know what will happen.   Rocket could fail and take out Tokyo, or just do damage to them by accident.    We wouldn't let another country launch rockets in our airspace.  That is why most try to launch over the ocean.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	We are stretched a bit thin with our military to be doing much of anything.  N.Korea seems to do this every time they need humanitarian supplies for their country.  We should not trust them and they should be watched very carefully.|`|D3e3teRSaa	No worries.

XuP0QwFtaa	I am going to quit for sure.  I think it is absolutely ridiculous.  I feel like the government is dictating what people should do because of the very high increase.  I am not even quitting because of the price, I am quitting out of pure principle that I do not want the government to touch a penny of mine because of this tax.<br>  I think a lot of smoker's will finally wise up and plan to quit.  There will probably be some people who will not quit but I hope at lease 30 percent decide to quit.  I think the government made a big mistake on raising cigarettes this much.  Some would say that it will save money in the long run because of health problems but, you could debate that forever.  For example, you could say that the government should tax fast food because it could save money in the long run.  <br>  The government is going to hurt more business because of this, something which is probably not a good idea now.  The government is just going to find something else to tax after they find out this does not work and probably think why they did this to smokers in the first place.   So come on anti-smokers, TELL ME HOW WRONG I AM AND GIVE ME A THUMBS DOWN!!!!|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	I quit four years ago, good luck.|`|FomIa9jQaa	I think some people are gonna stop smokin|`|4eLzY2hfaa	what's next big macs?|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	That's one thing I don't understand.  One of the justifications you hear for raising the tax on tobacco is that it will discourage people from picking up the habit or encourage current smokers to quit.  But then if they quit, doesn't that mean their revenue source would dry up and they would no longer have the money to pay for this new social program they have expanded?  So when that happens, who pays for the program now that people have gotten used to it and feel they are entitled to it?|`|ildgJVJoaa	We were just talking about this in my current issues class today. I agree that it's a good way to make money since so many people smoke, and a good way to make people stop doing a bad thing since the price is so high, but I don't think it's fair to make just smokers pay for the stimulus package (to which it's going). It's like punishing them for something that's not illegal, which is very wrong.|`|gsTpQmGfaa	Rising the prices doesn't solve anything, it just takes more money from people.|`|b6a091811b28070a1bddd2f561070d4baa	If it actually was going to healthcare I wouldn't mind so much.
