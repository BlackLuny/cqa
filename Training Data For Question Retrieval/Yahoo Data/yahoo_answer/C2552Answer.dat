igYM91eRaa	Just fix it you already own it|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	1. You do not have a 5.0. You have a 4.9. A 302 engine, is a 4.9L, not a 5.0. A 305 cu in, is 5.0. It was simply advertised as a 5.0, because uneducated people think it sounds better.    2. Your car is reasonably worth around $2 grand. Consumer guide auto for a 1995 Mustang: $1,700-2,100. Seeing as it needs tires, probably closer to $1800. And each year, it's value drops another $300-500 or so.    So, if you do sell it, at least know what you're selling, and what it's worth.    Edit: KBB Value, for a good condition 1995 Mustang for a private party sale: $2565. And your point is....? $3500 is still vastly overpriced. Nevermind that KBB is a value representation. Not a confirmed value. Actual market value of vehicles is generally 10-15% less than KBB reporting.|`|mTwn8p79aa	I think $3,500 is extremely optimistic with today's market.  KBB is over adjusting for the low mileage.  It'll be very hard to convince someone to pay that much for a 14 year old car.  If you take their condition quiz I'm sure the car would qualify as fair, not good or excellent.  It's just too old not to have at least cosmetic flaws and the tires alone would make it "fair."  It's more realistically worth about $2,500 or so.    If it runs well, keep it.|`|Fr6GdIQ3aa	I would sell your car in fear of Obama's proposed flat-gas-tax. Where the price of gas will be yearly set at intervals like $4.00 or $5.00/gal. If you have your mustang when this bill passes, you're going to be HOSED with gas prices that and you wont be able to sell your gas guzzler. Better off to convince somebody to buy it now while gas is cheap and get a civic, focus, or corolla while the 09 offers are still available.    Best of luck to you.

Nothing but Details  High Line and Performance Detailing Service    Or be creative outside the box of the normal names.    The Wax Spot    Impressions    The best way to name a company is to write down all the words that pertain to that industry. Then pick one or a combination of two to create your name. As a company name needs to speak what it does.    Wal-Mart = a mart within walls  Circuit City = a city that is of circuits  Burger King = king of making burgers    Now if Wal-Mart for example was called John's Store. Would it get the attention it does? Now look at other detail shops. Do the ones called Tommy's Detail get any business or look worth driving a Lexus up too? But a place that is clean, sharp, and has a catchy name such as The Wax Spot or The Wax Shop. One would feel comfortable driving a Lexus in. As the name alone gives the illusion they know what they are doing and that it is a business. Not some back yard guy trying to make a buck.    When I left detail and went into touch up paint work. The name I used is what made me the best known in town. Cause all the others were Paint by Steve, or such names. Where mine gave the illusion of a company and many workers. Often I was asked where I bought the franchise from. Yet it was no franchise.    Look at the industry, see what it needs, then fill it. And be the odd man out, for that is what will bring in the business. When my paint business grew I gained a custom shop. Within the shop I made up a cigar bar area for my rich customers. In turn my shop then became their private den or cave to hide from their wives. To look at other cars, to read car magazines, to watch auto racing on satellite tv.

That is what 2008 was all about. Right now they are offering 0% financing, rebates as much as 10k and even free deals on top of that like maintenance and other items for the first year. That is for new cars.    Used cars have also dropped in their prices. Sure there are a few car dealers who are sticking to blue book, hoping to recoup some of their losses. And those who don't bargain shop, in turn are the suckers who pay the old blue book value.    I myself have been shopping for a Honda Civic or an Accord. Something in the 1996-2000 range. This time last year, a 98 Civic EX went for an easy $7000 or a 98 Accord EX would go for an easy $10k. Today, that Civic is running around $3200 and the Accord is normally just under $4k. I would call that a HUGE drop in prices.    The price drop has been so huge. Those who use to service dealerships for their jobs. Such as touch up people, detail people, pin strip people, those who fixed windshields, removed smells from cars, etc. The prices are now so low, the dealers can't do any services to the cars. In turn all of us who use to service dealers, are now out of work. That alone shows me how much the prices have dropped.

I would go to autotrader.com and search for what you want within the distance your willing to drive. Make a list of the 4runners that you like then call the dealership and ask them if it is still available and what is the bottom line they will sell it to you for. CAR FAX IS GARBAGE if your buying from a new car dealership ask as many questions as possible about the history you do not want to get stuck with a used car that has not been taken care off BIG HEADACHES down the road. Get pre-approved at your local bank to ensure your best interest rate. The best way is go to Toyota dealerships and make sure it is Toyota certified not the dealer certified there is a big difference between Toyota certified  than abc motors certified. Hope this helped
ZasNwdXaaa	If you are putting in brake fluid, then that means you have a leak. Find the leak in the brake lines and have it repaired. Not wise to drive with a leaking brake line.

Looking through the panel you have to disconnect the wiring cable before you begin by squeezing the locking tab and pull.  You will then need a 8 mill socket screw driver preferably a magnetic type or you will possibly loose the nuts there is one at the top and two at the bottom. Once you've removed the nuts carefully remove the broken lamp from the vehicle and replace with the new one installing the nuts and then the bulb holder cable as removed.
9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	To little information.  What is the impedance of the subs?  Are they DVC or SVC?  What amp are you using or what are the specs of the amp?    You can typically hook up two subs with no problems but there are a lot of issues other then the power handling.  The impedance is a big deal because it will determine if the subs both get the same amount of power.  Current will take the path of least resistance so if one sub has a lower impedance then another it means that it will get more power then the other sub.    You have to know that the RMS rating is just a power handling rating.  It just means that you can safely power the sub with up to 600w RMS or 1000w RMS.  If you give both subs 600w RMS then they will both be fine.    Hooking up two different subs is almost always a bad idea.  It will lead to cancellation and just overall bad sound.  There are too many problems you will encounter when trying to hook up two seperate subs.  Not to mention that both subs will need different size enclosures to sound good.      All in all, just hook up one sub.  You may have a slightly louder setup but at the loss to sound quality.  It will be a much better setup in the end.    Good Luck!!!|`|gstBWswfaa	Yes.  Better question will it sound good?  Nope not at all|`|zeNcmyxIaa	Can you wire them both up? - Yes  Can you wire them both up to the same amp without blowing them? - Yes..as long as its low.   For best results, and for the safety of your subwoofers, its best to run them on seperate amplifiers. Also, try matching the ohms for the best sound.|`|mwcVzDjlaa	Its all about balance. Your amp looks at it like one speaker or one resistance. Depending on how you wire them it will see a single 2,4,6,8 or whatever ohm resistance. The power will be distributed equally between the drivers. Say you have a two 4 ohm woofers rated at 500 rms.You wire them in parallel to get a final resistance of 2 ohms at one channel. You also have an amplifier rated at 1000 watts rms at 2 ohms at one channel. Each woofer in this system would only get 500 watts. If you replaced one of the woofers with a 400 watt unit (same resistance) both will still receive 500 watts.   I'm assuming this is a one channel amp. If it is a two channel then the woofers will still receive the same amount of power. Peak power for a woofer is almost never achieved. Those numbers are more for show. IMHO i would just get a pair of matching subs.  Hope this helps.
0lBwS4QFaa	So you saying it is getting HOT and the radiator is still cold.  Who put in the thermostat?  You know there is a certain direction to install the thermostat.  It is actually stamped right on the thermostat itself telling which side should be facing the radiator.  It seems like no coolant is circulating to the radiator now.  Also you do not have to worry about the car heating up, but only need to worry if it gets into the red.       You pu in a new thermostat so it will run hotter than before because the old one was junk.  So if it is just running warmer that is ok, but if it overheats (RED) you have a problem.|`|p8UAIAisaa	I used to have a 98 Cavalier Z24 and I had an over heating problem while it was idling.. you may want to check the O2 sensor, seemed that was my problem.

e54245b949fc37ae37c1c0d76403714daa	Yes, Florida matters.  Yes, definately keep your tag.  Do not let the person you sell it to take them.  If you are buying from a dealership, then they will issue you a temporary tag.  They may do the motor vehicle paperwork for you, using your old tags, if they can be transferred to the new car.  If it is a private sale, and you will be doing your own motor vehicle, then you wil have to get all the paperwork and forms to your DMV to transfer the tags, if they can be transferred.  I wouldn't drive the new (or newer) car until I transfer the title and get the registration  to the vehicle you just purchased.  The reason I say "if they can be transferred" is the type of vehicle you have and the type of vehicle you are buying may be different and can not be transferred.|`|EGE0EAMtaa	yes , you must do that

XLXncQu9aa	It sounds like you hit the person in the red car from behind.  In most cases when you hit someone from behind you are at fault.  There are few exceptions but from what you are saying you are at fault here.  The best thing I can tell you is to tell the truth about what happened, and provide any evidence which would be the pictures taken at the scene of the accident.  The only way to prove your innocence is to prove that the other person the driver of the red vehicle started the accident by speeding.  Now if you look at it in that perspective then the driver of the red car is at fault because if it were for that person speeding and using the brakes so quickly then the accident wouldn't have happened.  But also note that this kind of accident can have multiple variables.  What I mean is, was there any changes in weather patterns?  Were you too close to the red vehicle?  I think you need to prove the innocence by showing pictures and telling the truth.

I have seen tire companies pull your leg to get a sale. <br>  Good companies will walk you out to the car and SHOW you the damage. <br>  Tires can be patched as a repair. ONLY if it is in a safe area to do so. <br>  Sidewalls are NOT repairable. Tire plugs are LAST resort only. <br>  If possible, jack each tire one at a time, run your hand around the backside to feel for tire separation (steel wires exposed). Then across treads to feel for belt slippage ( uneven feel along treads ..hilly).<br>    <br>  If you have to buy tires, and are on a fixed income, try to get two new for front and put best two on rear. Also, for cost purposes, check your drivers door for correct tire size and speed rating.

Or #2, drive a beater, don't fix anything you can live with, drive it into the ground, junk it or sell it cheap and find another clunker.  This choice is the cheapest by far.

I have 2 misdemeanors and I also have a Class A from Indiana.|`|AA11264416	i don't see why you couldn't, never know until you try and go ask whoever is in charge of classes|`|7PIQ2yyDaa	I believe the answer is yes. Holding a valid drivers license isn't based upon misdemeanor convictions or even felonies. That issue is more directed to whether you will be hired after obtaining your cdl. You should check with local employers to determine the guidelines of being hired The average determination is based on the age and severity of a conviction. i.e. a robber ought not apply for a job in a bank and a cdl holder should look for other work having a vehicular manslaughter conviction. Get the point?|`|lZsbIEo8aa	You are still eligible to obtain a CDL. You may not qualify for Haz-Mat endorsement though.
fe896c388193778daefac15405693e34aa	Its possible, but you will owe the remainder of the corolla PLUS the sale price for the 4 runner.|`|GHd84xipaa	yes it is can be done.they will roll over the amount you still owe on the other car in to your loan.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	It is possible in fact its done all the time. You take your Corolla to the car dealer. He will appraise the car, basically see what they think it is worth. The salesperson will call and get a payoff on your current loan. and see where your at on it. If you owe more then the car is worth the balance will be added to your next loan or you can pay that difference in cash. Be sure to do your homework. Have an approximate value of what the car is worth before you go. That way the dealer can't offer you to low of an amount. You may have equity in your trade so that will serve as a down payment on your next car. The best way really is to sell your car on your own. A dealer is going to give you wholesale for your car and sell it for retail. That is how they make there money. So if you sell it yourself you will get retail for it. Then you can buy your 4runner without a trade and keep it simple.

InWC84mgaa	You are legally correct. However, if the situation creates anxieties within you then I would advise you to expedite your pass and put yourself in a more relaxed mood. Driving is a full-time job and if you are distracted by the idiot tailgater behind you then you are compromising your full attention to driving as safely as you could without the distraction. Also, if you complain verbally to the other passengers in your car, they are most likely tired of hearing it.Sounds like you are a defensive driver but a slight improvement can't hurt.|`|ejAidBp9aa	I know it sounds stupid (and technically illegal), but if your gonna be anywhere but the far far far far right lane, go the speed of traffic, not 10mph slower just to drive the limit.<br>  Thats the simple solution to tailgaters...<br>  If your adamant about driving the speed limit AND overtaking cars by using the left lanes, get used to them flashy headlights.|`|KgHKlqjNaa	Well maybe if you didnt pass someone at 1 MPH faster than they are you wouldnt irritate so many people .  <br>  The sign says " Slower traffic keep right" for a reason.  <br>  You are actually the one causing the unsafe condition.  <br>  If you are going to pass......pass with authority.  You dont have to be mario andretti but a 5 - 10 MPH increase is acceptable.<br>  If you wont go that much faster you dont need to pass.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I maintain my speed but I put on the lights so it will appear that I have put on my brakes.|`|tUeH8HDdaa	I normally stick my fingers up at them and slow down on purpose.|`|AA11264416	i usually do the "brake test" i get on the brake a little to give them a clue to back the f*ck off, i hit the brake just enough to make the back end of my truck raise up just a little and slow down but not enough where they would run into me, and just hit the brake for a second, funny how when i do that they actually get mad because if you really do have to get on the brake then they will run right into the back of you so it would be their fault and still blame it on your even though they were 2 feet behind you going 50 ot more, but i bet if they did run into the back of someone they still wouldn't learn and keep doing it ........... but just for future reference, when you pass someone don't take forever, your supposed to pass as fast as you can, even though when your passing the person behind you is supposed to wait for you to get back over before they pass the car you just passed, but when you pass don't pass like a 90 year old woman, pass as fast as you can|`|TdrgZwnoaa	I ignore them. There is absolutely nothing that they can do about you being in the passing lane if you are indeed passing a slower car. Do not tap the brake and do not slow down. Up to this point you are holding them up a bit but if you slow down that will only aggravate the situation and they may retaliate. You may be within your rights but are you willing to cause an accident to prove your point. Just pull back into your lane as soon as you can and they will be gone. And you will be the better person for it.<br>  <br>   Never get into a pyssing match with another motorists. If anythings happens as a result you could be held as liable as the other driver.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Tailgaters are one of my pet peeves. <br>  I won't even ride anymore with some people because they simply make me grit my teeth by following way to close to the vehicle in front regardless of the speed.<br>  Whenever I have someone following so close that I can see the color of their retarded eyes and dumbfounded look in my rear view mirror, I constantly suppress my urge to stuff ny rear bumper through their grill and simply pull over and let the self appointed exalted one pass.|`|FmhUZLgoaa	Usually I get a little road rage..........you know slow down on purpose! I know it's not right but they tick me off!|`|Xl7UHNB1aa	slow down till they get really mad, or let them pass you?|`|XLXncQu9aa	The best way to deal with a person that is tail gating you is to remain calm.  Do not make any sudden movements and stay at the posted speed limit.  The reason why they tail gate is because they want to force you to speed up but what they don't realize is that they may cause an accident by following to closely.  They are impatient and you should deal with them as such, but do it in a way that does not cause them to react in road rage.  In addition to going at the posted speed limit, tap your brakes lightly every few seconds.  If they see that you are doing this they will likely back off of you some because they aren't sure whether you will stop suddenly or not.  If you do stop suddenly and they hit you because they were following too closely then you will not have to pay for damages and they would be at fault.  But the main things here is to continue the posted speed limit, and tap your brakes lightly.
AA11264416	if your talking about just a picture ID card that looks like a license then all you have to pay for is whatever the state charges to make then, basically the fee you pay anytime you renew your license, your just paying to get the license made, here in NC its $10 but could be different in your state|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Yes.

And no driver's license for a long time (years) or you may never be able to legally drive again. If it's just property damage, you will have to pay for the damages and might serve a few months in jail or if you're lucky, you might get probation and community service.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	probably some jail time, and if the ped dies, its worser...is that a word?|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	Hopefully they will catch you and heavily fine or suspend your license, why should the person that you hit have to pay for the damage that you caused with your careless driving.|`|0TiCSGKtaa	while it is a serious crime most municipalities are too busy w/real criminals to deal with hit and runs but yes technically you can get locked up specially if someone gets hurt

AA11885973	The Ford 302 was/is a pantywaist engine and should never have been put in a truck.  It was OK for my girlfriends Granada. My '90 Bronco had the 351 and I never could chirp the tires on dry pavement. The gearing is meant for towing  and off-road dependability.  If you want to burn rubber, get a rice burner.|`|TsJoADGPaa	sounds like you may have a clogged up catalytic converter.<br>  <br>  Also, if you change the air filter, spark plugs, distributor, spark plug wires, and fuel filter you can probably restore a lot of your lost power as well.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Judging solely on your obvious concern with spinning the tires, I'll give it a week, maybe two at best.|`|k55p1pKraa	That small block v-8 want spin tires on that heavy bronco, now if that 302 was in a small car it would spin tires, but back to your bronco if it's not running hot or smoking out of the tail pipe you should be able to get some more time out of it, you might need to change the fuel filters & put new spark plugs , plug wires , reset the timing to make sure it still in good timing|`|Slj0dfaqaa	My 302 never spun tires.  Just cause it won't spin tires doesn't mean it needs a new engine.  If you got money to be burning rubber all the time maybe you should look into more power.  Broncos are designed as more or less a SUV, not a sports car.  If you want power consider another choice.|`|tV64O8cdaa	If i were you i would replace the timing chain because it is sure to jump soon after you do that set your distributor timing throw some new sparkplugs and wires in it maybe a carb tuneup and it will run like no other any further questions email me at trenton11194@yahoo.com|`|SZBwwMGYaa	200,000 is a lot of miles, vehicles don't really last much after that, I would say you might get 250,000 max out of it before you have to replace your engine and transmission. I would say for your spinning tire problem you might see if it's times right, or clean/replace your air filter. I would say that it's up to you, depending on how much your getting it for and how much you feel is worth putting into it, if your going to make it into a off road toy you are looking at 2 grand, but I would rebuild/change the engine before you off road with it! :)<br>  <br>  I know how that's a need! I'm getting my car to do the same right now! :)
AAUjRGUmaa	It all depends on how well you maintain and take care of the car. If you keep up with the routine maintenance, and dont drive hard, the car can last you a while. But if you abuse the car, and beat the crap out of it, you might not have a long time left.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	my parent's 91 toyota previa is at around 450 000 km's.<br>  <br>  when it reaches 500 000 we're taking a picture lol<br>  <br>  <br>  remember how long it last also depends greatly on how well the owner takes care of the car!|`|AoNBI840aa	Toyota makes very good quality cars, you can get 350K+ on the odometer before it starts seriously screwing up, if you take care of it it could breach 400K, it all depends on current condition, and whether you bag on it or drive like a little old lady.|`|0TiCSGKtaa	it all depends on the maintance you give it and the past maintnance i've seen as high as 500k miles but again it depends on maintnance and your driving habits how much you abuse the car or take care of it.
c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	There's no magic figure on a used car.  How much do they have invested in the car (what they paid for it, what repairs/cosmetics they spent, plus paying the salesperson)?  They would like to make some profit to stay in business.<br>  How long have they had it?  Smart dealers work on turnover.  If it's been there longer than they like, they may entertain taking a small loss.<br>  I question if a Nissan dealer really wants a BMW in their inventory for long.<br>  What's KBB say on retail vs trade?  Figure on working somewhere between the two.|`|AA12399021	Most car purchasers haggle with the salesman to get them to come down on their price.
OLpWRv2uaa	Your Dad is mostly right.. starting out in 2nd gear is bad for your crankshaft and transmission. If you vehicle has tons of torque and a close ratio gearbox you can sometimes skip a gear or two, but it's not a good idea.  Your Dad is wrong, however making you shut off your car in neutral. Always put your car in 1st gear with the emergency brake on.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	-Always start out in 1st. Starting in 2nd is hard on the clutch.<br>  <br>  -Always leave it in 1st OR Reverse when you park. Leaving it in nuetral is just crazy!!! It could roll away.<br>  <br>  -If you have the speed, there's nothing wrong with shifting from 2nd to 4th. You typically won't find yourself doing that very often though.|`|GkB8tJnQaa	yeah, your dad is rightt.<br>  and its better to park with the car in first, with the e brake on, because if the e brake ever fails, then your car wont roll away.|`|hm6HQvqNaa	Mom's trying to save your gas Dad's trying to save your clutch. If you ever read your drivers training manual you would remember that when parking uphill you place the vehicle in reverse with the parking brake set and if there is a curb the wheels are pointed out. wheels pointed in without a curb. When pointed down hill 1st gear brake set wheels pointed in. When starting from a stop unless you are a clutch rider it will always be easier on the vehicle to start out in 1st gear. As far as skipping gears that depends on load-engine torque- and road conditions as well as vehicle speed. Some modern 6 speed high performance cars will actually block some intermediate gears if there is a danger of damage to the drive line because of excessive torque. As in 2000 corvettes and Camero's. The bottom line is this ask your parents to explain their reasons for their driving differences and explain to them Calmly that yelling to enforce their "Style" is not helpfull. Oh and never park any vehicle in neutral without applying the parking brake. When you have to leave a vehicle running while parked because of extreme cold or because you are having starting problems these would be the only times you would leave a vehicle in neutral. Some states will issue a ticket for an unattended vehicle that is left running.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Ask your mother.......Ask your father  Oh boy....<br>  Lets compromise the first thing.  On a flat or down hill start out in second this is less wear on the syncros  First on a up hill. The difference in clutch wear like this is minimal. <br>  Ok on the how to park.  Dad is totally right.  If you park in gear the timing belt or chain will most of the time have a little pulling stress on it and over time it can stretch.  I see this in a lot with peoples cars where they rely more on the compression of the engine to hold the car than the brake.  Its not very smart to rely on the compression of the engine to hold the car still.  This is why all cars ( and trucks) have a parking brake.  Its not really an "emergency brake" it may never be used in an emergency where its your only brake to stop.<br>  As to the gear changes do what you want as long as you don't red line the motor.
qjg0g5WMaa	yes its worth restoring unlike a rice burner it holds its value and any corvette will always appreciate in value<br>  good luck|`|JLayHNZCaa	What is wrong with your engine?  I had a red 92 and it ran strong and got decent gas mileage.  Go to corvetteforum.com for more free info on vettes, or if you decide to sell it.  They are always selling and buying there.|`|cnUKrcmuaa	I would agree it would be a worthy car to restore, however 92 was the first year that the LT1 350 was used. Some complaints I got about the engine are: its a bit of a screwy application, difficult to work on, and parts are more expensive than a regular first generation small block chevy.

o5KbZk1saa	That depends on the airline. I have personally seen United make a person buy a second ticket at the gate because the gate agent decided that they were too big for one seat.<br>  On the other hand we have a family Friend who is 5 ft tall and weighs about 300 and she has never been forced to buy a second seat.<br>  Call the airline first and confirm it.<br>  The other option is to buy a first class ticket.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  russ|`|BiFw6EWEaa	haha who ever told you that you have to buy two tickets coz your that large is full of it! the only way you would want to buy two tickets would be coz you cant fit on one seat. but if you cant fit on one seat, then you cant fly. coz you have to wear a seat belt. and i dont think your butt would be that huge? so you will be fine|`|AOPuoo16aa	That is going to be up to the airline. Some airlines will require you to buy two tickets if you can't fit comfortably in the seat with the arm rest down or if they feel that it would be uncomfortable for the other passengers to sit next to you. It can also be for safety reasons. You should start by calling the airline and asking them or be prepared to have to buy an extra seat.|`|1b037047daa5a242ff98379ffe8e03e1aa	Only your airline can answer that question. Typically, however, this would only come up on a full flight. If it is possible, they will seat you in an empty seat. (You may have to request this, as they won't want to assume anything or offend you.)<br>  <br>  If it is a full flight, and the only way to accomodate you is in two seats, then I believe the airline can charge you for the second seat. Doesn't necessarily mean that they will though. Ask your airline.

You could get by without a license at college. Bikes and skateboards are better to get around campus as it is. Don't sweat not having a car. Cars can get very expensive very quick. When you turn 18, go down to the DMV and see what you have to do to get a license. At 18 you are officially an adult and can take care of stuff like that without the help of your mother.|`|hm6HQvqNaa	The way the economy is going we may all be riding bicycles and skateboards soon. So don't sweat it.Life will unfold as it always does. With or without cars.|`|ffaH5Oz2aa	dude, just relax.  Just so you know, skateboards and long boards are one of the very popular ways of travel around a college campus and bikes are still used by 1000s of college students.   If you are going to college then are going to have a lot of exspenses, if you dont have to have a car, then dont get one.  Gas, car insurance, mechanics, ect... all cost money while riding a bike is free and healthy which can keep off the freshman 15.  You should get your drivers license though, my mother did the same thing to me.  If she doesn't you can get it on your own at 18.  Don't worry about the car.  Not having one does not make you a baby.  If you do get one, make sure you save the money for it, if you want to be grown up, then you should pay for it, not your parents.

2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Here's the way they think:<br>  <br>  They are very highly skilled manipulators.  If they have survived their business for more than 6 months, then they have found that they have a gift, to some degree, for manipulating and persuading.  They are working on commission, so the dealer is giving them a strong incentive to use that gift to get as much profit as possible from you.<br>  <br>  So how you deal with them is this.  You need to IGNORE everything that they say.  Remember you are dealing with somebody whose persuasive skill is much greater than yours.  They will use every bit of your nature and your training in politeness against you.  You must not vary based on anything SAID at all.<br>  <br>  Decide ahead of time what you will pay, and don't pay any more than that.  That's about the best you can do.  It sometimes helps to buy the car by email.<br>  <br>  Why are these people telling you to get a mechanic to check out a brand new car?  That's nuts.  As far as asking a salesman questions about the car, that's the last thing I'd do.  I'd be careful to ignore whatever the answer was anyway.  Even if the salesman knows something about cars (most don't) he doesn't have any incentive to answer truthfully.  His incentive is to tell you what you want to hear.|`|ye6Buzneaa	this is what you do. Heres an example.<br>  <br>  Lets say you want to buy a brand new Nissan Maxima<br>  The price is 30,000.<br>  Tell the salesman ill give you 27,000 for it.<br>  <br>  Due to struggling auto sales, you will most likely get an okay.|`|1YUNabs7aa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com|`|gaciwothaa	what kind of car?<br>  in this economy we have buying power.<br>  <br>  First do your research. All the major car manufacturers have online websites. Many used dealerships also have online websites that show their current inventory and prices. After you decide on what you want a car or truck and some models or years, do your research online and in local papers or by phone and find the going prices along with the lowest price. Keep in mind that mileage and options will greatly affect the price.  check all sites. <br>  <br>  Next pay a visit the to dealer who has the vehicle you want. Go armed with all your data, but keep in under wraps. <br>  <br>  A sales person will approach you and the dealerships rule is whoever approaches you first - you're his/hers customer and cannot work with another sales person without a lot of red tape. <br>  <br>  When the sales person approaches you, point out the vehicle you are interested in. Look it over and take it for a test drive. <br>  <br>  When you return the sales person will be ready to set the deal. Ask the price and ask what is the lowest price. The sales person will give you their lowest price. This is a price he is allowed to sell at. Remember for every dollar he lowers the price he is lessening his commission. To go past a certain point he must get a manager's approval, but it can be done.<br>  <br>  If the low price he gives you doesn't match the data you've collected, proceed to quote him the data without showing it to him. For example: If he says he will sell Car X to you for $18,000, tell him that Car X only has a blue book for $17,000 in the condition and mileage it is in. OR - Car X is only $16,000 at Bob's Car Lot across town and $16,500 at Jane's Car Lot in the next town and you will drive for the savings. Then ask him to beat their deals. (Remember, this is data you've collected in advance and not stuff you are making up). <br>  <br>  The salesman will try to tell you that his car has more options or better mileage. Or he may tell you to go to the other lots because that's the price he gets from his cars. <br>  <br>  Now you have a decision to make. Stick to your guns and buy from a cheaper lot if you can find one or give in and buy from this location. I have stuck to my guns and given dealers my phone number and told them to call me when they are ready to sell. I've had dealers tap on my window while I was pulling out of their driveway to tell me they would sell. If you can find out when the sales person gets paid, end of month etc., then you can decide when to go. Maybe he's had a bad month and will deal with you. Or, maybe he's had a good month and won't. <br>  <br>  Either way, shop around. You shop around for home furnishing, appliances, and more why would you let someone rip you off on a car? If you decide to buy, ALWAYS ask for a car history report before signing any papers. Never pay for this the dealership should provide it for you for free. If they don't, they are worth doing business with.|`|5ToEDcn3aa	I would ask to test drive it first. After you have obtained the vehicle for a test drive, drive it to the nearest garage or service center and have a technician or mechanic check it out ( this would work also if you have a family member who knows cars or trucks inside and out... imports would be a plus too). After the vehicle checks out okay, then drive it back to the dealership and haggle the price down to where you would feel comfortable paying.... sometimes you can talk the dealer into a deal, or maybe bring the price down a few thousand dollars. It always helps to test it out first..... talk money later.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Ask questions about the vehicle first.  Then when you walk inside to sit down at the desk, that is the time to tell them that this is gonna be a cash deal with no financing involved.  In this market, they should be happy to have a customer like you.<br>  BUT<br>  For a backup it never hurts to use an outside company to find out what the actual dealer cost was on the car/truck and then allow a REASONABLE amount ($150 or so) for them to finish prepping it for sale.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	The hardest part will be finding a true professional salesperson.  First, shop at a reputable dealership.  Not necessarily one that advertises all the time but one you hear good things about from your contacts.  Secondly, observe how they treat you.  Do they ask pertinent questions like what type of vehicle you had in mind, how you'll be using it, options, price/payment range, etc.?  Do they go over the features of the vehicle & how it may best fit your needs?  Do they offer a test drive?  Expect them to ask for your business without high pressure.  A smart salesperson knows this will not be the last car you & your family buys; repeat business is how one makes good money in any business.<br>  Now, if they push, immediately want to get your credit, show you vehicles out of your price range, totally different than you wish, etc., GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.

I am not 100% sure of this but its not the first time I've heard of something like that. I'd say, newer vehicles, they try to cut cost so they make no differences between motors and trannys so they fit together. This means less parts to manufacture. So I'd say your probably good, but it never hurts to call and ask an acura/honda person, I'd say try the parts guy.|`|hRDHF6SEaa	of course it will.the engine is cast to fit any application.you have to lose the torque inverter and flywheel and replace with your stick parts.pressure plate clutch etc.if i were you since its on the floor please change the rear main seal.talk to the autoparts guy and a call to the dealer is free.listen to them.|`|kY3waNn1aa	the motor is all the same but all computerizing system is different you will have a check Eng light|`|5ITR6x6gaa	No it wont|`|tV64O8cdaa	That depends on the bolt pattern on the back of the engine and the bolt pattern on the belllhousing of the transmission for any further information email me at trenton11194@yahoo.com

JLyYjBOJaa	That guy above me must not know wrx's...<br>  <br>  You won't get too much HP from the uppipe, but boost will be much quicker. It's also a grand idea to change out the uppipe to a non catted uppipe because any added boost from stock pressure could cause your cat to be damaged and then; damaging your turbo. With the downpipe and 'cat back' exhaust you will notice a lot of gains. Especially from the downpipe, it's a wonderful feeling!<br>  <br>  All-in-all; if you are doing your exhaust on a WRX and are going for turbo back, definitely change out that uppipe!|`|OgvkF5mvaa	U mean  a Down Pipe????<br>  Get a full exhaust with headers 10-50hp|`|k6u1Kka0aa	Good answer from fullthrottlehp. I own an 04 with a Helix catless uppipe and catted downpipe. The uppipe will create boost about 500 rpm sooner which makes it more enjoyable to drive. It frees up the breathing of the motor. Plus you will not have the chance of the cat breaking up from the stock uppipe and entering the turbo. Research forums below for more info.

I am certain the one for driving his girlfriends car will not cover him and I doubt if  the one for work will but the one covering his taxi business may. In any event he needs all three policies to show a solicitor because he needs someone to give a good plea in mitigation.

s9zefBbvaa	Go back to the police and see if they can track the person down. It is a crime to give false information to the police, so they will be fined, and the police should be able to track them down. Also, does your state require you to fill out an accident report? If so, the other party had to fill one out - ask the police for a copy of it because it should contain a license number and address.

Some of the older vans had the rear seat mounts break ejecting the rear seat. Modern designs are much better, yet the middle seat would be safer simply since its further away from a rear impact.

Gn0nR2S1aa	basically you can just leave the shifter in od, its to help with fuel economy|`|FsT54qh1aa	Overdrive is just a way to use the transmission for the best fuel economy. It is most useful on the highway. If your car was in D or (drive) on the highway, it might be at 4000rpm in 3rd gear at 70mph. It might not shift into 4th gear until you were going 90mph. By using overdrive, the transmission shifts to 4th gear to increase fuel economy and your cruising at 70mph is now done at say, 2200rpm in 4th gear. If you were to floor the pedal it would drop back into 3rd to give you passing power, but by remaining in 4th at a lower rpm....you save more fuel since your engine requires less of it to move your car when the engine is at a steady lower RPM.|`|lHLDvVALaa	Overdrive is a gear in the transmission in which the output shaft turns at a faster rate than the input shaft. <br>  <br>  This is good when you're cruising at a steady speed, as it allows your engine to run at lower RPMs, saving gas and reducing wear and tear. <br>  <br>  It's lousy for accelerating, since multiplying the rotational speed of the output shaft also decreased the torque transferred to the wheels. Since torque translates directly into acceleration(Newton's second law of motion), the lower the gear the better for acceleration. <br>  <br>  As for when to use it: basically, with an automatic transmission, you should leave it on all the time. The only exception to this would be where you need a lot of torque, such as when pulling a trailer. You can also turn it off to force a downshift when you're about to pass, or to help slow you down when going down a steep hill.|`|fDDgFrtNaa	overdrive is part of the transmission that is the last and gear possible to reach. it should be used when driving at high speed such as on the highway to keep your engine at a low RPM. some overdrives can be manually operated by just pushing a button and some are simply the last gear on standard transmissions.|`|MTkXXOsjaa	It's basically a fuel economy gear when traveling around highway speeds.

mwu6aJuyaa	the lexus is cheap because that's all it's worth. Expensive luxury cars depreciate REALLY fast once they are out of warranty because they are so much more expensive to repair.

The lexus on the other hand would have a 5 grand transmission, (these are just examples) when you need to fix your tranny, it's a grand for a new one. When the lexus needs a new tranny..guess what...5 grand.<br>  <br>  hope that example helps with your decision. People wont pay a ton of money for a car that is expensive to fix.

fhfKOKjgaa	Harleys use a scavenging oil system and when they sit for a while, they can wet sump from oil that leaks past the oil pump check valve and into the crankcase. When you first start it up it will puke oil for a while.<br>  It's also possible that it's over-filled and oil is coming out of the crankcase ventilator (breather.) It sounds like the bike might have an aftermarket engine breather oil collector like this on it: <a href="http://img.jpcycles.com/product/431-335_A.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.jpcycles.com/product/431-335_...</a><br>  If so; drain all the oil out of this unit before starting the bike. (some water may come out too when you drain it.)<br>  Check the oil with the bike upright and level. The oil level should be between the two marks on the stick. If it's over-filled, drain a bit from the drain hose that comes from the oil tank and has a plug at the end of it. Then start it up. If it pukes more than a quart or so shut it off and check that you have the right oil filter.<br>  <br>  Edit: You said; "I didn't get 1/2 pint out in all. I only put 3 qts in it to begin with, although it requires 4 qts to be full."<br>   It sounds like the oil sumped from the oil tank into the crankcase and it might puke more than a quart out of the breather before the oil in the crankcase is scavenged back into the oil tank.<br>  Don't expect to get 4 quarts in it. <br>  I have a 96 FXSTC. It won't take more than about 3 quarts.|`|JLBcdRwCaa	This sounds like a crankcase breather filter from your description. Look at the link to the J&P oil collector filter in these answers. If it looks like the little filter on the top of that then it's just a crankcase breather filter. When a Harley sits for a good while oil could sump into the crankcase and will literally puke out when the bike is started. That's not an uncommon condition. Also from your oil change description it sounds like you put in too much oil. . By the way there is a oil filter on the front of the engine, did you change that when you changed the oil? Make sure to get one for an EVO engine and not a Twin Cam.  When you change the oil only start with two(2) quarts in the oil tank. Crank it up and make sure that you can see oil circulating when you look inside of the oil tank filler cap. With that part complete turn off the engine and add no more than a half a quart and check the level it should be mid-way on the stick. It's better to need to add a little as you go than to have too much oil in the tank . I hope this helps you out. Good Luck.|`|LPsmRI5Oaa	That's a new one on me. Could be as simple as you over filled it. Or like golden rider said some of the old models did do things like that more I think about it. Between that and the chain oiler that's where the legend of Harley's leaking so much oil came from.|`|G5zN12dbaa	Check to see if its overfilled, check to see if oil has a hint of gasoline odor to it, if so, needle valve in carb may be stuck open flooding gas into engine.|`|WsKUEgQraa	Sounds like something is missing.The oil cooler doesn't have a breather on it.The oil cooler is part of the closed loop return system back to the tank.The return line does not have a breather on it.<br>  Edit If it looks like a little filter then Scooter is probably correct about the sump filling with oil.It will pump oil out the breather til the crankcase is empty.There might be a piece of crud on the check valve ball seat that is letting the oil fill the crank.As soon as the crankcase is empty is should stop puking oil but if it sits again it will probably happen again as soon as it's started.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Some of the older Harley's just do that, but if it has high miles on it, it may be time for a ring job.

5JI64hBnaa	Start by trying a replacement switch for that door from a junkyard if you can get one. Or check ebay. If that doesn't work, it's the window motor and that is a b*tch. Again, junkyard. You will need a riveter to replace that. Probably better left to a mechanic or someone with experience. You can also get a voltmeter or circuit tester and use it to learn how the working rear switch operates, then see if the non-working window switch operates the same. If it doesn't, it's bad. If it does - you guessed it - it's the motor. If the switch is bad and you can't find a replacement, run a jumper between the wires at the switch and the window will at least go up for the time being. Of course you will have to understand how the switch is operating to do this. <br>  <br>  It's definitely NOT your battery, though. And it's not related to your clock. I can guarantee those.|`|yI5ldlc1aa	Maybe its the battery going bad. Cause of your problems with the starting. maybe you have fuses bad?

But it's the only way for you to get another car.|`|9AGTYeU7aa	You need to apply for a loan at a dealership with a Special Finance Department. They will try to find a lender to finance you.

They will match you up with a dealer in your area that can help you. Good luck.|`|Nl2U569eaa	Well, of course the best option is to pay cash.  Maybe you should buy a bomber privately and drive it for a year (maybe two) and save $ to buy a better car. Stay close to home though. Those cars don't last long. Or, if you really need a car that'll get you around you may need to go to a buy here pay here. J.D.Byrider is pretty good about getting people financed. i don't know how high of a score you would have to have. Can't hurt to go in and ask. Remember that interest rates are higher than typical lenders because of the risk they take in financing people with bad credit.

I turned the A/C on full blast and made sure it was on fresh air(not recirculate) then poored warm bleach water into the "vents" on the windsheild wiper cowl(the vents around the windshield wiper). This is where the HVAC pulls in air from the outside. I did the bleach water twice and then used fresh cool water twice to flush it out. You should also try to get someone to see if your evaporator drain is clogged which will cause mildew to form if water builds up.|`|333a8b96e50ca7be29e4122a1437a3d4aa	I would pull the heater box apart and pull the heater core out and wash as much of it as you can with bleach and even spray some bleach or mildew remover into the vents, bleach kills most microbes, hopefully it will help the smell.|`|b3Abersiaa	My dad has the same car. Hi five :) and his for a while had a mildewey smell too. It just went away, but we live in a cold climate so the cold might have killed the mildew or whatever was causing the smell.

qjjmsNCxaa	If you use a 350 crank in a 400 it will be a de-stroked 400 commonly referred to as a 377,the 383 is a 350 using a 400 crankshaft and requires turning the 400 crank on an offset radius to fit the smaller 350 journals,to install a 350 crank in a 400 you would need to use a spacer bearing,if you bore the 327 0.40 you would be at 332.6 cid, so you would round up to 333 cid,however if all you intend to do is bore the block you will not see significant power gains from adding 5-6 ci but the rebuild would restore some lost power.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	No, it would be close to a 340cid. To get a 383 you need to start with a small block 400, de-stroke it with a 350cid crank shaft. The 400 crank has a long stroke and does not turn the rpm`s that the shorter 350 does. then put a  good cam and camel back heads, Eldelbrock performer intake, 650 Holley carb. you wil have a very fun engine. I know I built one of these. It came out to 350hp. A real good tire burner. Just go first over on the 327.  0.10" to clean it up the build it up good from there. If you do the crank & rods right you will be able to get 7500 rpm`s out of the engine. It was a screamer engine. My friend shifted his at 7800 rpm`s.

gEw83TRTaa	I hate to tell ya, but those numbers are almost always off.<br>  <br>  As a dealer, we have to look at a car and decide what we plan to do with it.  That will help to determine what we will give on trade.<br>  <br>  If we plan to retail the car, we look at what needs to be done to make it 'retail ready'.  Tires, detail, paint work, etc.  Any cost of reconditioning is going to com off our offer.<br>  <br>  If the car is likely to go to wholesale or auction, we look at the latest auction sale results for similar cars.

It has software issues also. Control modules shut down or fail sometimes (most important control modules start at $800 for the cheaper ones). Window regulators also have problems sometimes. You just have to be prepared to put money into it, especially with that high mileage. Definitely the first thing you have to do is a timing belt.

FsT54qh1aa	A good rule to follow for oil changes on anything is 3 months or 3000 miles. For everything else, you should consult your owners manual and service everything else at the proper mileage intervals indicated.|`|S2LjGZC1aa	if your mileage is 6000kms OR you pass a certain amount of months, then you go in for service. so no matter what, its recommended you take care of it.
iosLyJcKaa	What exactly is your question? By Federal Rules here in the United States, you must have a CDL for certain vehicles. I'm not sure what you mean by heavy vehicle? If a vehicle is 26,000 or less, you do not need a CDL, even if it has air brakes, unless your transporting hazerdous material or passengers. If it is over 26,000 you will need a CDL regardless of it's brake type. And if you need a CDL for the vehicle you will need an air brake endorsement if the vehicle is so equiped. <br>  As far as the other part, of course it makes sense that if you have a CDL and are driving a vehicle that needs a CDL you will make more money then someone driving a non-CDL vehicle. If I have a CDL and am driving a 40,000 pound motorcoach with 60 people on board, I sure as heck better be making more money then a taxi driver, carrying 2 people in a 2,000 pound car.<br>  As a CDL driver you are subject to random drug/alcohol tests, must have a medical certificate proving you are fit to operate the vehcile, must have special knowledge, training and skills, must pay more for your license renewal, are held to stricter standards, are expected to be more professional, etc.  So yes, of course it makes sense that you would get paid more.|`|AA11264416	yes it makes sense because the bigger trucks makes the company more money, at one of my last jobs i delivered building materials to construction job sites, all but 2 trucks required a CDL, all class B though, 3 were flatbeds with a 24 foot bed and with forklifts on the back, one was a box truck, the 2 that didn't require a CDL was a small flatbed that had a 18 foot bed and then the other was a Ford work van, which do you think made the most profit? more weight you can haul means more money, oh and also teh small flatbed that didn't require a CDL had air brakes so its not air brakes, its basically soley on weight rather it needs a CDL or not, and yes its 26,001 or more you need a CDL|`|lM9NvSwnaa	It depends on your state and federal guidelines.  But generally there is no concenous between states as to how heavy a vehicle is before you need a cdl.  I learned that when I worked driving a 15 seat bus in PA with no cdl but found I needed one here in TN to drive the same size bus.<br>  <br>  Federal guidelines seem to be taken by most states as "strong suggestions" rather than absolutes.  If the vehicle comes from the factory with certain features then it is technically a cdl vehicle and should only be driven by a licensed cdl driver, even though an identical vehicle may have the same features but the title says it is not a cdl vehicle.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	with out a cdl you are not legal to drive a vehicle with over a 17,000 lb gvwr. air brakes is a endorsement on the cdl if you qualify. At lease where i live.
bPfXAHt8aa	no, it is not legal on a vehicle pre-1975. there are several ways around this, such as a test pipe or a ecu tune that clears the codes. both of these will trick the testing facility, but only if they don't do a visual inspection for the cats. i'd run at least one cat simply to not have the rich exhaust smell. one high flow cat will have almost the same amount of flow as no cat at all. might as well save yourself the hassle and go with a cat.|`|JTv7fx9Baa	If your car previously had a car on it, then no it is not legal. If your car did not have a cat on it then your fine. If you really want to run a catless system, then you want to look into a hi-flow cat. it will do pretty much the same thing as no cat.|`|755ece7feef9ddfd8ec966cf315dc95baa	The only problem you will have is at mot time but all you need to do is fit the cat back on for this. If you dont tell anybody how will they know?  Never heard of anyone ever being done for it.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	It is against federal regulations to have anything other than the OEM cats on any car.  With that said, most states just do an OBD scan for emissions testing and they can be easily fooled.

My niece bought a nice little used Aveo this summer and paid $5000 for it after it was fixed up.  She has no debt.   She's driving a car that's easy on gas and less expensive to insure.<br>  <br>  ... you can do the math.|`|RWjvcCYoaa	No. No lender will consider anyone at 620 or less. That's just the way it is today. Our economy is in the worst state since the Great Depression. No lender will take a chance on high risk applicants anymore. <br>  <br>  I deal with lenders every day. They don't want to see any credit apps that are not backed by a 621 or higher FICO score. If they meet that, there are many more stipulations they must pass before the lender will approve the loan. <br>  <br>  Your best bet is to work at improving your credit score. It may take a couple years but getting a loan will also be difficult to get for the next few years too. By the time the economy turns around, you'll be in a much better position to qualify for a new car loan.|`|NlYGbqnkaa	Most banks have an internal scoring system. Which means they are taking into account several factors to determine the risk you present when you apply for a loan. Things such as job time, income, time at your current address and so on. With most banks there is a Fico based teir system in place to determine your interest rate but not to determine if you get the loan or not. Not to mention the car your looking at. They will have to make sure the value of the car is more then what your paying for it. If your paying 22000 for a car that is worth 15000 you will likely get turned down. The best thing to do is sit down with a loan officer at a local credit union and explain your situation and see what they tell you. After all is there money and they ultimately will say where it goes.|`|2ee9ba3f8fa52a8c3bd583c6f12f11b8aa	Why would you want to do that to yourself?  Sounds like misery to me, making huge car payments for basically the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Of course, you could make some other people rich if you keep spending and paying high interest rates for your whole life.

d7oxOMT6aa	Lots of Rovers in my family, and they have, on the whole, been very reliable.<br>  <br>  The Rover 100 is basically the same as the Austin Metro launched back in 1980, so they rust lots, and are terrible in an accident, on the plus side, they have very good handling and steering, and are good fun to drive. they are also very light compared to more modern cars so you get very good fuel consumption. <br>  <br>  Many people have fitted the VVC engine from a MGZR into the 100, its almost a sraight swap, and makes a very fast car.<br>  <br>  The 200 is a better car, the wiring is mostly Honda spec, and very reliable, the only problem is where the wiring enters the tailgate at the top, so check there. alarm problems are usually caused by a short circuit there. No real rust problems that I have seen.<br>  <br>  The K series engine is well renowned for head gasket failure, but this is usually caused by a fault elsewhere, often the waterpump or radiator leak and cause the engine to overheat. the latest payen multilayer headgasket has improved matters here, but check the coolant regulaly, and investigate any losses. no other real problems exist with the K series, and they are capable of high mileages if they are looked after. They can be abit tappy at times, but this is usually nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  People will tell you that you can't get parts anymore, but this is wrong. aside from a few rover 45 / MGZS body parts, and some VVC engine parts, its all available from Xpart, and well priced. plenty of rovers in breakers yards as well, and second hand parts are available on EBAY all the time.<br>  <br>  You get a lot of car for your money with rovers thanks to their bad reputation. those of us who know the truth about these cars, are doing very well out of it.|`|ECiwZVe1aa	if you would consider a rover100, then why not go for an older Nissan micra.

But the finish could be better. It seems they spent millions designing 99% of the car then went cheap on the finishing touches. <br>  <br>  Don't get one with a sunroof, they all leak (prime example of the cost cutter build quality)|`|V3GD1Awxaa	if you have a chose then avoid rovers they will cost you more in the long run when it breaks down (not if).<br>  <br>  avoid anything french and rovers.<br>  <br>  go for German or jap, they might be more initially but will be cheaper to run and maintain|`|rQdMan31aa	For the money you`re talking any cars condition would be an issue but  a 25 or 100 would be an excellent choice as long as it has a long mot and no history of head gasket failior.

uL5772kCaa	Both will work, but attaching it to the car chassis is better because most factory grounds are crap. They could create alternator whine due to bad grounding. If you really have problems grounding to chassis, then just ground it with the harness and check if everything works fine.

It could possibly interfere with the ABS and the speedo/odometer, and possibly cause the transmission to shift a bit differently for a while. I believe you can get the speedometer recalibrated but I'm not sure where.
w2PDUIXpaa	Since this is an aviation area, I'll describe the two primary forms of propulsion in use in aviation - internal combustion engines, and turbojet/turbofan/turboprop engines<br>  <br>  Internal Combustion Engines, 4-Cycle, Magnetos: <br>  <br>  Cycle 1: The intake valve is opened and a precise mixture of fuel and air is drawn into the cylinder by the vacuum caused by the downstroke of the piston.<br>  Cycle 2: The intake valve closes, and the piston begins its travel upwards, compressing the fuel/air mixture above the piston head compression continues to the top of the piston travel. <br>  Cycle 3: The magnetos cycle per the preset firing order, sending a charge to a set of spark plugs (2 per cylinder) causing an arc of electricity at the electrode tip of each spark plug, igniting the volatile fuel/air mixture that has been compressed in the cylinder, forcing the piston down due to thermal expansion. <br>  Cycle 4. The exhaust valve opens as the piston reaches the bottom of its travel and the piston returns to the top of the cylinder with the rotational momentum of the crankshaft, forcing exhaust gases out of the cylinder and resetting the cylinder for another combustion intake cycle.<br>  <br>  Turbojet/fan/prop/shaft<br>  <br>  Air is drawn into a compressor stage of a turbine increasing its pressure through each of several stages. Compression is achieved by forcing air driven by the turbine blades against stators in the compression stage with density of stators increasing through the stages to increase the compression. As air is compressed, it heats proportionally. This superheated air is forced into a combustion chamber igniting fuel in the chamber which rapidly expands and is forced through a final turbine section driving an output shaft to power the compressor section and finally out of the engine as thrust. In the case of a turboprop or turboshaft, the turbine is used to both power the compressor section and an external propeller or rotor.|`|U24VtSlZaa	In general, fuel vapor mixed with air in the proper proportion is compressed then heated beyond it's autoignition temperature, either with a flame (in the case of a turbine engine), or an electrical spark (in the case of a gasoline- or alcohol-powered piston engine).  In a diesel engine, a source of heat is not necessary because the compression is enough to heat the fuel/air to the point of ignition.|`|Tiph3lQcaa	In a turbine engine, the supply air is compressed to a condition of high static pressure and temperature by the compressors. It is introduced into the combustor through a series of louvers and holes that provide a thin boundary layer of cool air to protect the combustor sheet metal from direct contact with the flame front. Fuel is sprayed into the combustor in a fine mist (liquid fuel does not burn, only fuel vapor does). There is an igniter that is either an electrical spark or a pyro ignition device (depending on whether the engine is for aviation or for missile applications). This lights the vapor mixture to start the engine. Once the engine has started and is running in a stable fashion, the igniter is generally no longer needed, since the flame will keep burning as long as fuel is provided.|`|aDpWkGIwaa	if you are talking about a normally aspirated internal combustion egine, then basically when the piston compresses the air in the crankshaft it mixes it with air/fuel and then sends a spark through the spark plug thus igniting it. but if you want diagrams and videos check out how stuff works.

Overdrive on you have a 4 speed automatic, with it off it's a 3 speed. With overdrive off you will notice a little quicker response from the transmission. launching from a dead stop, some say that OD doesn't make a difference, but I always felt that od off, PWR was the fasted combination. If you hit the highway, turn OD on, or your revs will be unnecessarily high, and your trans will get hotter than it needs to be, not to mention you will waste gas.

At your age kids whom are dating may have a bad home life, or a not one at all.  You have a home, that's key  keep focused on school, talk to girls just be polite but not to.

You are thirteen, stop analysing yourself because you have yet to find who you will become. If your temper is an issue perhaps look at some techniques to control it or maybe some help - it doesnt have to prevent you from having friends. I grew up with two brothers with very bad anger issues and they found techniques suchas counting to ten in your head or breathing really helped. Making friends is not a question of how, if you are friendly and nice people will like. Try to be more open and friendly say hi and how are you, mae conversation with people perhaps you have meant once before. If you dont like how your friends are acting, drugs, racism, then try to distance yourself becoming closer to the ones who are nicer and make new ones. Remember you are thirteen, this may seem like a huge dealnow and trust me ive been there, but friendships change around alot at this age when people are trying to find their place, its a confusing time.

Some go to make friends, but other are there to "do" life.  Some just don't see it as the "background" people of life do.They take it like a drug and consume it.  <br>  <br>  Starting a new life wouldn't be the best idea in the world because eventually that "new" life will turn old and it will be the same all over.<br>  <br>  I think you just need to look at life not from the begging, but with new eyes...find someone that is "different"  (usually someone that feels the same, but can bring him/her self upward...the quiet ones that don't stand out most out of everyone )   (most common is a person's girl/boy friend)<br>  Resemblence<br>  Your life seems trapped like an animal in a cage nothing "new" to see and nothing "new" to discover...<br>  <br>   <br>  Try going trough another path and change the route ...<br>  <br>  Sometimes i feel like killing myself, but i know I haven't seen much yet...when i reach 16 i'll barely be able to see things a little diffrent       People should enjoy their lives and live it like their going to die tommorrow ,becouse we won't stay one age forever and time flies     make your life worth while and rememberable...you'll too die someday|`|QODJNf1oaa	Maybe if you got some help professionally things in your life would get better.

(i know, i hate it when people say that. its like okay great, you diagnosed the problem now how am i supposed to deal with it?)instead of thinking negative things about yourself try (yes, put some effort into it) to think possitive about yourself. if you dont stop putting yourself down then you will eventualy fall into a deep dark hole called depression. (trust me, i should know) as for your friends you should definately distance yourself from them. if they're doing druggs then most likely you will start doing them (hopefuly not, but its possible) and that will pull you deeper into the hole until you eventualy feel like you cant get out. to make new friends try to keep your temper under control and just say hi and smile. thats a good way to make friends. as for the girls who hate you, its probably because you hang out with the boys. as long as the boys arent doing anything like drugs then keep hangin with them. the girls are just jelous. hope i helped! hang in there! email me if you need anymore help.|`|OmNiQuK5aa	Ahh man where would i start. i have basically the same life. Try hanging around with younger or older people that don't know much about you and get them into liking you as a friend. Then other people should begin accepting you a little more at a time. That's what i'm doing and it's working so far. If that doesn't work Here's my backup strategy, have a long talk with your parents about how boring your life is, and get them to really believe you. And don't let them trick you with that " Oh i always thought that too and now look at me" crap, because it's more than likely a lie. The next day tell your teacher whats going on (If your teacher won't care, don't bother) and tell him/her only about the people abusing your short temper.  The thing about the girls i cant help you with. Girls are just made that way, nothing we can do about that (Unfortunately). Im in grade seven and i cant wait to go to grade 8 because then i will be able to hang around with the people who aren't going to be idiots and those ones are much more mature than the people that dont like me. Hope this helps :)

HQrMEkm0aa	In the long run, you don't save any money and it will only cost you more to maintain and service.  Not too many mechanics out there know much about hybrid,a backyard mechanic won't be able to help you.  Once the hybrid breaks down, it's going to cost a huge fortune to keep it running.  the money you save from on fuel doesn't make up for the cost of maintenance and the cost of the vehicle itself.|`|giEc5I1Oaa	Hybrids not worth the cost your better off getting a used small fuel efficient car Trying to calculate how long it will take you to recoup your up-front premium when buying a Prius for example is problematic, because there is nothing to compare it to. The Prius only comes as a hybrid, so you can't compare it to, say, "a V6 gas-only version" of the Prius. The Prius's MSRP is $20,950 - $23,220, depending on level of equipment, and has a fuel economy rating of 48/45/46 (city/hwy/combined).However, it is possible to compare a Toyota Camry Hybrid to a "regular Camry."The Camry Hybrid is powered by a 4-cylinder engine, but for comparison purposes, Toyota spokesman John McCandless claims that, "if you take into account the equipment level of the Camry Hybrid -- and that it has the performance of a V-6 -- the best apples-to-apples comparison is to compare the hybrid to a V-6 Camry LE. Those base prices are less than $2,000 apart -- $23,640 for the Camry V6 LE, vs. $25,000 for the Hybrid."Toyota reports that the Camry Hybrid's fuel economy rating is 33 mpg city/34 mpg highway. Meanwhile, the Camry V6 gets 21/31 mpg, city/hwy.For purposes of comparison, McCandless used a combined fuel economy rating, splitting the difference between highway and city mileage."So if you drive 15,000 miles a year, and you buy the Hybrid version, you'll be using about 454 gallons a year," says McCandless. "Meanwhile, if you get the V6 LE, you'll be burning 635 gallons a year. At $3.20 a gallon, that's a fuel-cost saving of about $547 a year. So it should take you three or four years to recoup the up-front premium you paid to buy the Hybrid. Plus, you get the satisfaction that you are easing the emission imprint on the planet." Oh and I didn't even mention how expensive it is to repair a hybrid compared to a non hybrid

A boat with less than 80% or so of it's maximum horsepower is underpowered -- if that boat would take 225, then it was at 51%,  it would've been so lame -- nobody would've bought it.<br>  <br>  The US Coast Guard guidelines say length times transom width (in feet), times 2 minus 90, rounded up to the next multiple of 5, which for an 18.5' boat with a 6' transom would be 135;  that puts 115 at 85%, which is reasonable.<br>  <br>  If your boat is 8'5" wide at the transom, then 225 is ok.|`|csmEH6qsaa	Capacity plates can generally be found on the inside transom, or next to the helm station. If removed due to repairs you can only estimate the power required and weight capacity.  I believe that the 225 will be way too much for your boat.  <br>  A motor larger than recommended will make the stern too heavy and can cause the boat to flip. The transom will ride too low in the water and you could be swamped by your own wake or a passing boat's wake. Your boat will not sit properly in the water and will be difficult to handle.<br>  <br>  The standard became effective for applicable boats manufactured of mono-hull boats less than 20 feet in length, except sailboats, canoes, kayaks and inflatables. The standard became effective for applicable boats manufactured after November 1, 1972.<br>  <br>  While it is not a Federal violation for a boat owner to exceed the listed capacities, many states do have statutes prohibiting the carriage of people and gear in excess of the stated capacity, or the installation<br>  of a motor that exceeds the recommended horse power limit.<br>  <br>  A 225 Mercury is a big and heavy outboard - have one on our 24'.   chase skiff.|`|4KvLIa6Saa	At the vintage of the Glasstron and a rebuilt trans> 115 is more than enough> 150hp increases the weight and torque on the entire boat> and more hp means more speed and that will pound the old hull apart> Beside if stopped and they check the rated Hp was 115 you might have issues if over powered> Also the trans height makes a difference>So check what you have as it will probably be 20" and today's engine are mostly 25"|`|iTj5NdH1aa	Take a peak around your boat for a maximum rating plate. It will say the max number of people, and max horsepower for your boat.<br>  <br>  Since your boat is old though, it probably won't have one...<br>  <br>  For an 18.5 footer, my best approximate guess would be a 175 horse... because those tri-hull Glasstrons are fairly light boats.
9oiZ6Rmbaa	Here's a guess...<br>  <br>  Low 15s in the quarter, maybe high 14s on a cool day, at low to mid 90s mph.<br>  <br>  350 hp and 350 lb-ft torque would be a good rating.  Could be more with the right cam for those heads.<br>  <br>  This might sound conservative, but is respectable for a full sized truck I think.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and have fun at the track!
2kR4sX48aa	it should be fine pulling,<br>  <br>  but stopping is why it is rated at 1500 lbs<br>  <br>  i had a 22re toyota pickup and pulled another pickup same year which was 4400 lbs.<br>  <br>  just from experience it pulls ok goes slow, but its really hard to slow down.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	A small U-haul trailer weighs about 1000lbs without anything inside, so it should work.|`|txoXobsAaa	yeah i've seen small cars towing huge things|`|1OKjARTEaa	My 4 cylinder Camry's rated at 2000 pounds, but I routenly haul 3800 pounds.

f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	With the stock tire/wheel still mounted in the swingarm, look at the widest part of the tire where it gets closest to the swingarm on both sides. If you can put the tip (1/2 inch) of your finger in that gap, thats about 10mm. Take the stock width and add 10mm (5 for each side) and if there is a tire made in that configuration in the compound/tread design you want, your in business. You may have trouble mounting the new tire/wheel back up with the brake caliper bracket, but if you don't break the bead you can let almost all the air out of the tire, then re-inflate it after getting it all tied back down.|`|AYvFuGzjaa	The largest I have seen is 250 with stock everything, beyond that I do believe you have clearance issues with swing arm and fender.
EGE0EAMtaa	come to MVA office which one nearest to your home and tell them, if you don't report to them, you are in trouble if someone use your license|`|31Ttgqlbaa	I've seen on the TV show COPS that police can verify a license driver (without their license) by providing their name and birth date and maybe their social security number. You won't go to jail if you be honest and provide police with your correct information.|`|lM9NvSwnaa	Depends on your state, but mostly no, because if it was that easy than anyone with a computer could just down load anybody elses license and raise all kinds of trouble.<br>  <br>  If you get stopped before you get to your local DMV to report it lost, the police can indeed check to make sure you have a current one that is not suspended.  It may take a few more minutes, but they can do it.  And it would be a good idea to report your license missing to the cops anyway in case it turns up at a crime.|`|WlFSaOpQaa	dont think so but if you get pulled over i think you ave a day or so to produce your license and if you tell the cop that you are on your way to getting your license they may let you slide. if your really that concerned about it drive carefully and obey all the traffic laws or have someone else drive you. also if you drive yourself park several blocks away from the building a lot of times cops will hang out by those buildings to pop people in your situation|`|SUlkDzn3aa	Do you get pulled over that often? LOL<br>  <br>  You should be OK till tomorrow or for a few days.  Carry some other form of ID.  You might have some 'splaining to if you get pulled over but I doubt they haul you to jail unless you are commiting an illegal act in the process or getting pulled over.|`|pZvJpuJTaa	Nothing online...you just have to wait, not drive.....if you get pulled over, explain the situation.  If you still get a ticket, you'll have to go to court and show your license for the infraction to be removed.
JuP5VB37aa	I recommend you visit a nearby car insurance agent to assist you. Since I live in Nevada I can't recommend an agent in Michigan, but here is an online resource that can help you. <a href="http://www.autoadviceonline.com/Auto-Insurance-Quote.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.autoadviceonline.com/Auto-Ins...</a> <br> <br> Good Luck.|`|31Ttgqlbaa	Normally, you'll have to be on somebody's insurance policy (it doesn't matter what company) to be insured to drive other people's cars. If he doesn't have his own insurance or he's not on someone's policy, then no he's not covered. But it depends on your policy; there might be an exception (rare) in your case. Call your insurance company.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	You'll have to ask your agent.  There are a lot more questions that would have to be asked, to make a final determination.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	Generally, yes, a person that doesn't live with you at your same residence can barrow your car and be covered under your insurance policy. They must be licensed, as you stated your friend was, and they must have permission to use your car. They must also not use it on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  If your friend got in an accident and they were going to work or something, you might have some explaining to do because going to work would imply that your friend barrows the car on an almost daily basis.|`|pZvJpuJTaa	You have to check your policy.  Normally if they have permissive use, insurance will follow the vehicle.<br>  <br>  Some policies have exclusions on non rated or non listed drivers.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	That depends on the terms of your insurance policy.<br>  <br>  Either study your policy, or call and discuss with your insurance agent.|`|WlFSaOpQaa	It depends on your insurance company, but generally no.|`|VUXrAYu4aa	making use of the SE such as google or yahoo to generate some ideas first if you would like to get the massive information,nonetheless if you would not  want to put so much time,here <a href="http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-auto-insurance.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.AutoInsuranceFree.info/free-a...</a>  is a direct and useful resource for your questions.
bY4DLWboaa	I'll give you some engine-wise stuff later, but first know that the C-Class is a 4-door sedan and the CLK is a 2-dour coupe/convertible. The CLK is on it's way out, to be replaced by the new E-Class Coupe.<br>  <br>  Here are some engines used on these cars:<br>  <br>  C-Class:<br>  <br>  C300- 228 HP, 221 lb-ft torque 3.0 L V6 Engine, 0-60 MPH in 7.1 seconds-MSRP $33,000-$35,000<br>  C300 4MATIC- Same as above, but all wheel drive.-MSRP $36,000<br>  C350: 268 HP, 258 lb-ft torque, 3.5 L V6 engine. 0-60 MPH in 6.1 seconds.

The C-Class has been around since '94 and the CLK has been around since '98.<br>  <br>  For the current model year ( which is also incidentally the final year for the CLK.  There will be a next generation coupe coming up but it will be called the E-Class coupe but it is still considered the CLK replacement ), the CLK comes with either a 3.5L V6 or a choice of V8's, either the 5.5L V8 or the AMG version of the 6.2L<br>  The C-Class comes with a choice of V6 engines, a 2.5L ( Canada only ), a 3.0L or a 3.5L.  The 6.2L AMG V8 has also made its way into the C63|`|k8iZatoxaa	A clk is what happens when a C class and an E class get drunk and have a love child.

ocjqgn6Maa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - autoinsurance.noneto.com|`|PRx6j6YQaa	whatever car you buy have it checked out by a mechanic well worth the money|`|7da25fkTaa	The cars in the 2-4 thousand range are often considered the less reliable cars, cause they'll be a little older.  For that reason alone, unless you do your own mechanic work, I would opt for a car that's been proven for reliability.  What first comes to mind would be anything from Honda or Toyota, like a civic or an echo, depending on what you like.  My wife has a Ford escort ZX2, those are also cheap cars and it's highly rated in Consumer Reports.  I would stay away from any chevrolet cavalier, pontiac sunfire, dodge neons, grand ams, grand prix... there reliablity really sucks ask anyone who own them!|`|qJkRPhIKaa	some piece of crap.<br>  <br>  That wau if you get in an accident the repairs is only like $5.

CNIfCmn2aa	It'd probably be partially his/your fault. If I remember correctly, you're suppose to go into the turning lane only when the markings indicate you can. So you'd be at fault for doing so before the lines appeared and he'd be at fault for turning without signaling first.|`|a6FNJGFMaa	If you were in your own separate lane then it would have been the other drivers fault, especially if there was no turn signal, but his or her fault none the less.  If it was one lane and you thought everyone was going straight but you went around them and a car trned to go right, then it would be your fault.|`|AA11729285	you would have been at fault because you went over the white line and also you were behind that car. well, it probably wouldnt have been all your fault, but it wouldnt have been all their fault either.|`|13a4553edcd55e39e57a5e00dc71c8edaa	I think the other driver would be at fault for the reasons you gave. It could be partly your fault if you were not driving in a lane.|`|0TiCSGKtaa	it sounds like you were going straight and someone switch lanes into yours so yeah i would say it was the other partys fault.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	It would depend on where the damage was.  As long as the damage was to the drivers side of your car, it would be his fault - failure to use caution while changing lanes.

But shouldnt be too hard about 20-30 years from now, but right now we just have to stick with the Veyron for 1k horses|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	No.<br>  <br>  Some newer cars lower there displacement with newer generations.<br>  <br>  The next Z could be a 320z with a turbo kit. You never know.<br>  <br>  For example, there is the VW R32. That is the AWD, 240-250HP 3.2L V6 version of the VW GTI. The next one to come out in a couple of years might be called the R20 with a 2.0L turbo engine making 265HP.
7BLJ45cVaa	I have a 94 Wrangler with a 4.0 and a manual transmission. I plan to list it for $5000. My experience is that the automatics are not as desirable as the manual. I would offer maybe $4800 if thats what you want. You also want to make sure it has not been beat to hell and that the transfer case works properly. The np231 transfer case is chain driven and can wear out with normal driving.|`|tXS3fdxraa	Depends on where you live.... It has a lot of perks...

They didn't bring it over because it's not practical.  You're talking about a very small group of mullet heads that are trying to relive their youth by buying an El Camino type vehicle.  You could make the argument that it could possibly replace the Ranger and Colorado that auto parts stores use.  Ford can sell the Ranger so cheap and having a Pontiac steal sales from Chevy accomplishes nothing.<br>  <br>  GM isn't in a position to offer a new vehicle in hopes that it sells.  The G8 has a market, the Solstice has a market...having an El Camino type vehicle isn't going to make them any $$$.

This way you dont end up spending the money on something else, you can put that money as a down payment.<br>  If you don't wanna do that call the DMV and they can offer you a proof of ownership, or you can use previous registration papers as the other person said, but you can save both time and effort by giving the dealer the car.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|SuZbBnycaa	Calif rules: <br>  IF the junkyard insists on a title, you need REG 227 Duplicate title form, it will be mailed to you in about 4-6 weeks.<br>  <br>  MAKE SURE YOU FILE A RELEASE OF LIABILITY.

fQBfjdz1aa	i'm not sure what the question is.  You totaled the vehicle.  you have a state farm policy.  <br>  <br>  The claims adjuster owes you fair market value.  NOT NADA or KBB or any other value you can find.  they will take into consideration year,  make,model, mileage. condition, prior damage unrepaired, intereior, exterior, dash, windshield, tires, basically everything and given a value for this.  Your "agent" isn't an adjuster and most know no more than you do  as to what the value is.  As far as faxing it to your agent, it shoudn't matter where you have it faxed to.  you can have it faxed to the pope if you want to.  Agents aren't able to do more than  you can normally on your own.  At least this is my experience.  And to be honest with you most of them know nothing about claims.  I don't pretend to know how to sell a policy.  They shouldn't  pretend to know how to adjust one either.  That's they the two are separate jobs, most of the time at least.

TdrgZwnoaa	If the driver is not a registered airport limo he can drop passengers at the airport but cannot pick up at the airport.

0Th3lvynaa	If i was you then I would go to college and get a four year degree in something besides aviation. Go to a regular flight school and get all your rating done there.  If you do all your flight training in college then it will take you a lot longer to get done.    Get a degree in something else just in case you loose your medical later on in life for some odd reason.  Always have a backup.  If you need a flight school you can check out this link: http://www.flightschoollist.com  Hope this helps.
qMicmG94aa	i think its funny, in New York State you can get your Pilots licenses at 14 but drivers at 16 people can USUALLY do more damage in a plane then a car|`|AZmzHV5Qaa	well... see there are two types of flying, privately i mean, glider and power, glider is flying without an engine and staying uploft by air currents and thermals, etc. Power on the other hand is with an engine. Now for glider you must be at least 16 to go and at least 17 for power. Not everybody gets into flying courses and such. You must give an exam and if you get higher than the average[ around 84%], you must go to boards; if you want a scholarship,write a one page essay why you should be chosen and then they will decide from your marks from school and so forth and then send you away for glider or power. Glider is 6 weeks and power is 7 weeks away from home. Flying is harder and not harder at the same time compared to driving.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!<br>  P.S. scholarships are awarded mostly in cadets.|`|illEyGMoaa	yes it should be, the only type of people who train for their PPL are the ones who have a passion for flying whether you start training at 10 or 50. Why would they want to jeopardize having their pilots license.|`|55vO5aCqaa	No... I dont think you should get a pilot license the same year you get a drivers license bucause it just seems too young to have a 16 year old flying a plane.|`|10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	First if you are in the US the licenses are granted by the FAA and not any state!<br>  <br>  The FAA requirements are listed in Federal Aviation Regulations part 61<br>  They state the following.<br>      * Be at least 16 years of age for a student pilot license and 17 for a full pilot’s license.<br>      * Have a current FAA third-class medical certificate.<br>      * Log at least 40 hours of flight.<br>      * Have at least 20 hours of flight with an instructor.<br>      * Have at least 10 hours of solo flight.<br>      * Pass the FAA Private Pilot Airmen Knowledge written test.<br>      * Pass the FAA Private Pilot flight exam.<br>  <br>  So there can only be student pilots licenses issued to 16 year olds. With that they can solo but can't carry passengers. The solo's can only be done with an instructors approval.<br>  <br>  Is it too young. If they complete the required training and flight tests then they know how to fly.  Would I fly with them? Depends on the person.|`|0Th3lvynaa	You have to be 17 years old to get your private pilot certificate.  You can solo an airplane at 16 but that's about it.  I started flying when I was 14.  By the time I was 16 I was flying all over the place with my instructor.  If you can pass the test at 16 then you should be able to get your pilots license.  That's what I think.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Age is not the issue.  If tests of piloting ability are adequate, then anyone passing the test should be able to fly.  In practice, though, tests tend to be imperfect, especially in a psychometric sense, and so they cannot identify pilots who may be reckless or dangerous due to their behavior.  Placing a minimum age limit on who may fly is a crude measure that tends to reduce recklessness (because many teenagers are exceptionally reckless, due to inexperience and hormonal influences), and perhaps it is better than nothing, although it is very inferior to, albeit much easier than, comprehensive testing <br>  <br>  The same principles apply to licensing for other types of vehicles.  It's not age, it's behavior—but since testing behavior reliably and completely is very difficult, and since there is a loose correlation between age and behavior for many people, an age limit is put in place as a compromise.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't know whether 16 is an appropriate limit or not, because there are 16-year-olds who could easily be trusted to safely fly a 747, and there are others who should not be let anywhere near the driver's seat of any type of vehicle.|`|NCvX4I0baa	I think that if they could then a series of very complicated testing should go along with that because a teen who's spending time to study so much for something most likely won't screw it up by "drinking and flying". <br>  <br>  Many 16 yr olds legally or not drink and drive. That kills a couple of people in the car the hit and such. Drink and flying? They're going to hit a plane with hundreds of people in there.|`|lEFEKi6Qaa	Very good question. not old enough to vote, not old enough to drink...... but old enough to fly solo?   hadn't given it any thought but you are right it is worth consideration.  The only saving grace may be that if takes effort to go through the required rituals so maybe only the serious make it.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	The FAA system is far better for the training of pilots seeking certification than States are at training drivers for their licenses.<br>  <br>  Deaths on the highway vs deaths from air travel bear this out, even on a per capita basis for miles traveled.

Your looking for anywhere that is adding power or ground depending on what is actually doing the control of the circuit.  If I saw the diagram I could probably help more.

The 2009 has the 3.7 liter. All that was changed was the stroke. The engine block is the same. And the G37 has a 7 speed automatic now. So the best way to go is the G37.

Mostly because of the new styling, and the larger displacement.|`|cnUKrcmuaa	You have to love Nissan and how they make figuring out the displacement of vehicles so in your face. Personally, as a starter vehicle, I would go with the G35 over the G37. The reason behind it is, that the G35 I am willing to bet would have a 3.5 liter engine versus the G37 would have a 3.7 liter engine, with a slightly higher displacement. Stereotypically a larger displacement engine would produce more power which would result in an excuse for the insurance companies to charge more being more "sportier". Also the displacement would typically be a factor in using more gas. I would suggest looking into other factors, like cost of maintaining and what safety features each vehicle would come with.

qjg0g5WMaa	1Check that your car battery is fully charged before beginning these tests. <br>  Step2Move the gear to neutral if you are diagnosing a car with a standard transmission or park if you are diagnosing a car with an automatic transmission. <br>  Step3Apply the parking brake and make sure to stay away from moving engine parts as you proceed with these tests. <br>  Step4Disconnect the coil high tension cable form the distributor cap and ground it using a short jumper wire. <br>  Step5Ask your assistant to turn the ignition key to start while you listen for a click at the starter solenoid. If you hear a firm click, go to step 9 if you have an on-starter solenoid; go to steps 10 and 11 if you have a remote-mounted solenoid. If you hear a weak click or repeated click sounds, go to the next step. <br>  Step6Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. If there are two small wires, disconnect the one marked with an S, otherwise check the wiring diagram for your particular vehicle to locate this wire. <br>  Step7Connect a jumper wire to the battery positive terminal. As you bring the other jumper wire’s end in touch with the solenoid’s control circuit terminal you should hear a solid click; if you do not hear any sounds or hear a weak or chattering sound, make sure the solenoid is properly grounded and there is no corrosion or other substance preventing a good ground. Repeat the test. If you still don’t hear a solid click, replace the solenoid. <br>  Step8Unplug the small control circuit wire at the solenoid terminal. Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Using a voltmeter, test for voltage at the control circuit wire. If the meter reads 0 volts, there is an open in that part of the circuit preventing the solenoid from operating the starter. Locate and fix the open. <br>  Step9Ask your assistant to turn the key to start. Check for a voltage drop between the solenoid's battery terminal and the starter motor strap. The voltage|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	You are not getting fire to the starter. Check all of the starting connections first.

This does not covers any problems that come due to vehicle being in some accident.<br>  <br>  Auto Insurance: This provides coverage against damage caused to your vehicle, or caused by you to some other vehicles in case of an accident. Any such damage to the vehicle is not covered in Auto Warranty. <br>  <br>  So, both of them are totally different.

The warranty covers mechanical breakdown.<br>  <br>  <br>  You are much more likely to have an INSURANCE claim, than a WARRANTY claim.|`|3G33CWJEaa	it depends, auto warranty is something you get for your car for it's engine and all that, but an auto insurance covers if you were in a collision and helps you to cover up your costs. It's two different paths. But if you have both you are on the safe side.

kNJbZeCgaa	sure, dryer hose and hose clamps will do a lot for the plumbing, the heat under the engine can be taken care of by wrapping the hose in exhaust insulation, used to be asbestos, not anymore but still good, you can use just about any type of pipe for the outside pickup, however, it is going to look terrible, unless you route it up the back of the cab, like an exhaust pipe, however, with a prefilter off of any tractor or farm implement you can find, I once made one for a diesel powered pickup which was made with 3 inch exhaust pipe, unioned with rubber hose from a cloths dryer, routed the pipe up the outside of the back side of the cab, got a precleaner off of a freeman 2 wire baler, then tied everything to the frame and body with copius amounts of baleing wire...it worked, was butt ugly, and everyone made fun of it, but it allowed an old style diesel 4x4 to run with water over the hood, and cross streams with impunity...good luck.
fNbCeyF6aa	Check to be sure that the rotors you are using are correct for your vehicle.  There are two types available and they are not interchangeable.  There are cast rotors and composite rotors.  Check by comparing them with your old rotors.|`|skfHV92caa	I work on Jeeps frequently and have never heard of your situation.  You may want to check to see if you have the brakes installed correctly, but first check to see if the parts store gave you the right products.  I have seen parts stores just give people the first thing on their list and not reading the applications.  If you have the same caliper bolts that came off, then you have a problem with the product or an installation problem.  I would try matching up your old pads and rotors to ensure they are the same size and type.  Also make sure you did depress the caliper piston all the way in.  I hope this helps.|`|KPFQBQa1aa	Like Mike J says, there are different hat heights on the rotors.  They will appear to fit but will not have the right back spacing and the caliper bolts will hit.

JwUHCwcJaa	The VR-4s were relegated to the 3000 GTs and the Galants. Sam was right in saying that the 3000 GT VR-4 came with twin turbos. The Galant VR-4 on the other hand, came with both standard and twin turbos. The earlier Galant VR-4 came with turbocharged inline 4 engines. When the Galant acquired a V6 engine in the later model years, the VR-4 of those model years had V6 twin turbos (1992-1996 model years and 1996-2003 model years).|`|4qurIEtpaa	The VR4's are equipped with twin turbo v6 engine and all wheel drive with 330 hp.

If not more, depending on any custom parts you need. And that's keeping it stock. With upgrades, you quickly start looking at $10k-15k, upwards towards 20k.    And the car will be 100% illegal to be on the road, and all it takes is one person popping your hood, to have your vehicle impounded, and you heavily fined.    Is it worth it? Not in the slightest.    Edit: It's illegal, because the engine was never designed for the US Market. In order to install it, you must remove your engine (with emissions equipment) and replace it with the RB (no emissions equipment). Both actions are a violation of federal law.    You can put whatever you want on the road. Doesn't mean it will stay there long. It will fail inspection, plain and simple. You can always pay someone to pass you, but that in itself is a federal offense.
w5oQJpDwaa	No. If you need a little extra room you can remove the fan blade. Very easy job.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	You probably do and getting access to the radiator will be much easier. Hoods are pretty easy to remove generally. you will need 1 helper who can lift half of the hood. Its not as heavy as it looks. i suggest taking a marker and circling the hood hinge washers so you can get the adjustment easier when you put it back on. your helper holds one side - loosen the hinge. you now go loosen the other side while supporting the hood. put a cover or pad over the roof of the car first. when you have the hinges loose flip the hood upside down and put it on the car roof on the pad. that way it wont get edges dinged up.    to reinstall, reverse the process, and tighten the bolts and washers in the patterns you marked. lower hood carefully to make sure clears - may have to fine tune adjustment.|`|iTwFGskIaa	i have a 1967 lincoln and did not have 2 remove the hood. if your rad attachments were like mine there is a splash pan located under rad. remove the pa. n and you will find 2 nuts holding the rad in 2 brackets. remove the upper and lower rad hose after draining the rad remove the tranny cooling lines and the rad should slide upwards. the problem removing the hood is when you install it again its a ***** 2 line up. if the alignment is not right and you close the hood it is very difficult 2 open because of the location of the latch. do yourself a favour and replace all the hoses with a new thermostat. flush the system also.  good luck mike
7MDSf3odaa	This is not a bolt on part.  Some things are best left to the professional, this is one of them.  Replacement/repair, may require cutting and welding. This brings special risks to a DIY operation, like setting fire to the car, and maybe even a house.  A professional might be able to repair it with out replacement, and some welding.  In the long run, it will be money well spent (IMHO).
mTwn8p79aa	Then you need to find someone else who's over 18 to do it.  Be careful who you choose, it'd be awfully easy to take advantage of you in this situation.

You should feel very proud of yourself for being a decent human being!|`|MWEn7fcwaa	If you're 20 you're excess is likely to be 500. Yeah, seriously. That's what mine was. Check that her quotes are from a local garage, rather than a big chain because it'll likely be less, and offer her what you think is reasonable to cover the damages. Ask your Dad, if you can, Dad's always know about this stuff.   Like someone else said, most would probably just drive off, so don't pay over the odds for it. Don't go through your insurance, it will definately not be worth it.|`|GPrw1JZkaa	Your insurance excess will be higher than the repair, tell   the other party you don't want to go through the insurance and ask them to get quote for you.  but you get one also you might find one cheaper than there's however if they want to go through the insurance you don't have a choice. you have to do what they want.|`|mlrXQWZBaa	Dont answer the phone & forget about it.

Don't go the insurance route unless the driver tells you she need the whole side of the car replaced.    Don't sweat it.|`|t1WOxnI8aa	I hope the drive of the other car is an honest person other wise he or she could try and get you for more than a scratch.|`|mTwn8p79aa	There's no deductible for your PD (property damage) so your insurance can take care of it with no cost out of pocket to you but they may (and probably will) increase your premiums.    If I were you I'd take care of it if it's under about $400 and I'd get my insurance to take care of it if it's anything over that.  Legally, you're responsible for her rental car while it gets fixed too so that could get expensive if they need a rental car.  Even on a fancy car a door ding should be less than $300.    Thank you for being a responsible person and doing the right thing.  We need more people like you in the world.    I'm not sure about all of the "excess" I'm reading about.  Maybe it's how it's done in Europe.  Here in the US there's no deductible for liability coverages, like PD.|`|ncwQ6IYlaa	Your insurance might refuse to cover that under just a parking lot door ding - normal wear and tear. your insurance company is NOT obligated to pay a claim just because you ask them too - or just because - the person you ding asks them to. Your insurance policy is to DEFEND you against claims. They will only pay the claim if they deem it necessary.   Since you seem to be so honest maybe the dingee will let you off for $50-100 and an apology. i wouldn't go any more than that.|`|ffAmoqFTaa	A claim stays on your insurance for three years, so your rates will be higher for all three of those years.  Since you are a young driver they will stick it to you for having an accident, even if you didn't actually have one.  The best thing to do would be pay for the damage to keep your rates from going up.  Good luck!|`|2536a43e8762c853996d1cfdf73bd0f7aa	Well done for leaving your details. Get the owner to get a quote from chips away who do a mobile scratch repair service at a reasonable cost. It would probably be best if you paid for the repair yourself rather than involving your insurance company as using your insurance company will mean you have to pay a higher premium next year and you will still have to pay the excess on your policy.|`|EopteDzsaa	just wait until she gets an estimate, you should have taken a pic and done your own investigation to see if she will try to rip you off.  If it seems excessive then contact your insurance co.|`|jI85GYGoaa	You are one in a million for doing the right thing but I doubt in this case if the damage was as minor as you describe you have done yourself any favours.    Car parks are notorious for minor bumps and scrapes and only to be expected.    You may be lucky and hear nothing further however if I had done it in similar circumstances with the luck I have I'd be looking at a 6 person whiplash claim.  You must take into account that there is a good chance you are not dealing with a reasonable person.  You instructed her to get an invoice for.. what exactly??. She may in the worst case insist the entire panel be removed and resprayed at a Main Dealer. That could be an expensive cash transaction.  Further by instructing her so I would have thought that you had done something your Insurer tells you not to do which is admit liability.    I have seen countless bumps, shunts, scratches and dents  some quite severe caused by 'middle class respectable' types who should know better casually ignore the damage they have caused and blithely drive away as if it were the other often absent motorists fault.    Anyway - Deny involvement- Its not worth setting the wheels in motion.  There are going to be hundreds of thousands of claims going in over the next few days due to snow.    Best Wishes|`|mKVFIklaaa	The chances are that the cost of any repair will be less than any excess you'd have to pay: Check your excess & wait for her to get in touch with an amount.
t2XRy9G5aa	always start with a fresh spark plug.  sometimes the porcelain can have a hairline crack, appears to be getting a spark while grounded outside but when installed can go directly to ground not causing good spark... and of course, this is cheapest, quickest and fastest thing to check...     after new spark plug, more than likely you have trash / water in the fuel system OR had some which is now clogging up jets ... or the bike sat a while and formed residue commonly referred to as varnish in the carb... easiest is to drop float bowl gently to check for any trash in the float bowl... I usually would merely pull the carb off the bike and fully disassemble in a container with some carb cleaner (chemtool b12 is an example of common carb cleaner) and get an old tooth brush and carefully scrub every little part including the float bowl and carb body... reassemble... pull the air cleaner and thoroughly clean and re-oil...    once all that is accomplished, your bike should run... if not, get a compression tester and check compression of the cylinder.      another thought with these new high performance 4 strokes, is valve adjustment is very critical and will make a bike extremely hard to start if these are out of tolerance... good idea to also check these too and adjust accordingly...    fuel, air, spark, compression ... all at the right mixture and the correct time...|`|AA10408111	don,t know to much about yzf450 but on afew of my dirt bikes setting in the garare for a while i,ve had  mice  build nest in my exhaust and strangled it out  like your 2min. running time  check that its cheep.the rest of the ansewers on crab  are good too start basic good luck|`|AA10582974	Check for clogged pilot jet in the carburetor.

FIG58FVpaa	Look in the door jam or in the owner's manual to see what the recommended size is and then go up from there. Don't go too much bigger or you can throw your speedometer too far off as well as cause the tires to rub on something.    Edited to add an explaination on tire sizes.    The first part (from the example the 205 part) is the width in mm. You probably won't want to change this because making the tire wider would probably slightly lower your gas mileage.    The second part (65) is the % of the height of sidewall to the tread width. (The side of the tire will be 65% of the width.) This is what you'd want to change to make the tire taller for better gas mileage. Maybe try a P205/70/R15 tire if P205/65/R15 is what the car is supposed to use?    The last part (15) is the size of the wheel in inches. You CAN'T change this without buying new wheels.

I'd suspect a bad brake switch or an  improperly adjusted brake switch on the brake pedal.|`|ND1nFEWSaa	do you mean the rear brake tail light or the light in the dash?<br>  <br>  I'll assume the rear brake light in the back of the car, <br>  <br>  to fix this you have a switch under the dash above the brake lever, the metal piece that holds the brake pedal.<br>  this switch needs adjusting, a shop can do for $ 20-25 dollars<br>  <br>  if it is the light on the dash---check your brake fluid level--add to full|`|auW4Kwxcaa	yea your brake fluid might be low, open the engine n look for a box thingy that holds liquid n it should say brake fluid on it  look at the meter if its low get some brake fluid n fill it up|`|SZBwwMGYaa	wow, the first two guys have no idea what there talking about, I would see if the wiring is worn out, or your sensor is getting dirty or is worn out|`|0TiCSGKtaa	you might be low on brake fluid|`|RTBvQJHbaa	Your fluid in your master cylinder is low.  This is usually caused by your brake pads in the front being low/needing to be changed.|`|k55p1pKraa	Your brakes may have air in the lines & need to be bleed out, you may also be low on brake fluid. Raise the hood and see if your brake master cylinder is low on fluid , if so just fill it up.
wPHY7E6aaa	for sure go for the 6speed,  becouse it has one extra gear, and in higher speed your RPM is going to be much lower!!  you can go faster.   and also the most important thing is there is much less pressure on your engine!  in higher speed  there is no pressure on your engine.|`|SZBwwMGYaa	Okay, first off scions are the gayest car to make into anything (that's my opinion at least) the 6 speed normally has lower gears and gets better gas mileage, the 5 speed goes faster I think but gets worse gas mileage.
AA12023445	Mazdas are a good car. they will usually last as long as a toyota . but when you need repairs they are also as expensive to fix as toyotas. they are among the most expensive do to having foreign components made overseas and not being able to easily obtain them. but overall i think you will like the car and if you have to put 1000.00 into it and it lasts ten years or more you got more than your moneys worth.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	It is a great car.<br>  <br>  Sporty sedan. Handles like a sports car. Fun to drive, reliable, but a little expensive to maintain.
FQiqtP33aa	Thickened Glass for protection (bullet proof) causes polarisation of light thus appear green.|`|EvodAqEkaa	green is in <br>  design|`|KdXEpDc1aa	He wanted to tell environmentalists he drives in a "green" vehicle?
J6cq8j9jaa	Good questions!<br>  Not really sure but I would assume it would smell like nothing? The body isn't in there long enough to make it smell.|`|7a5085b19b90c46573ae023bb4086356aa	Why would they smell? The caskets are sealed, and I would certainly hope the Hearse drivin' dudes would wash them down after every load, so to speak.|`|PuMpS7fLaa	The smell of a dead body is usually rancid when it has been sitting somewhere rotting. People that are in a hearse have had the fluids drained from the body and filled with embalming fluid. They wouldn't smell otherwise no one would have an open casket funeral.(unless the driver stinks..)|`|SZBwwMGYaa	I would say no, but if you really wanted to find out go to a funeral home had open the door and find out, or email them and ask.
TLzYoO8Laa	This is normal. every one of them does it. its very aggrivating but you'll get used to it.
mKVFIklaaa	Take it back. It could be something simple, or it could be a leak due to a failed heater matrix, or due to a misaligned shell or badly replaced windscreen.|`|FWDRZJBiaa	check the corner of the windscreen, could be a piece missing. (like my clio) or check your sun roof if you have one.|`|nP92OdBzaa	Take it back to the garage as soon as possible. Your heater core is probably leaking. That can be pretty expensive to fix, depending on the car model.  To get rid of the smell and wetness, first use paper towels to soak up the coolant (really press it on the carpet to get as much out as possible. Then get a carpet cleaner foam from Kragen, Auto Zone, etc.  Spray that on and work it into the carpet with a brush and then soak it up (follow instructions on can). That should get rid of the smell.  Or have the garage pay for the cleaning of the carpet by a detail shop.|`|InLhfJ6Daa	Of course you are drying the carpet out but you will have to find out where it is coming in. Obvious places are windows and doors but it could be from the car heater.  Another place to look is where the water runs down from the front screen at top of bonnet, there are gullies to take away the water and sometimes these become jammed with leaves etc.|`|8tnKpZcoaa	Close sun roof.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	leave the windows open and the front seat tilted up so the air can get to it. a small fan would help.    if it's leaking though you're gonna need to find the leak. if it gets wet every time it rains it'll start to stink after a while.|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi  Start with a shop vac. Then put your heater on the floor and leave a window open to get rid of the last of the dampness. At max heat.
PlcKGtrgaa	of course, it improves your hand and eye cordination there fore will enhance your awareness and abilities to operated a vehicle.<br>  <br>  pretty much basic skills of focus and operation-<br>  hope this helps|`|3G33CWJEaa	it sure does. trust me the thing you learn from riding a bike really helps. It took me 10 years to realise that, but thanks to my dad I was able to ride my bike when i turned 10 and it helped me to get the license when i turned 16. It does helps you to think all the handling balance an most of all braking.....
hRDHF6SEaa	i bought a chevy suburban 4x4 and put 6 in.lift on.awesome monster truck.anyway,go to quality auto parts store or 3 and price the stuff.it gets pretty spendy.i personally went with dick cepak and rancho.pretty easy install.be wary of coil springs.remember when your done your tires look like shopping cart wheels so be prepared to spend.most important,do NOT GO CHEAP on steering stabilizer shocks.i use two.or those 300 buck tires will be shot before you pay them off.more important,the lift raises your center of gravity.turn slow or roll over.dont be cool,be smart.seatbelts please.|`|bvCkplELaa	Question is way too vague, what kind of truck is it. If you want answers you need to think about your question. Is this a 2 wheel drive subaru or a four wheel drive Excursion with 24" rims.|`|AA10021250	Rancho is good but remember that when you lift a vehicle you might have to replace your stock brake lines with longer ones,and you might run into drive shaft issues also you will have to buy longer shocks.When you do it be sure to pay attention to pinion angle so you don't get anything in a bind and cause problems|`|aysOuR83aa	Depends on your ride .Some are easy and can be done in your driveway. I have a 96 Z71 and for 6 inches you have to cut the entire front end out from under the truck. It costs about 4000|`|SZBwwMGYaa	I don't know what kind of tools you would need, I have never done it ether :) go to places like www.4wheelparts.com, they have great lift kits on there, and I think they come with instructions on how to do it, but I think you would need one of those things that lifts the entire vehicle in the air, I don't know just a guess. But I would defiantly do it my self, it saves on money and like you said, you get the experience :)
TgofxBFfaa	Depends on the level of performance chip your wanting but generally no. All the chip does is adjust certain parameters in you computers preloaded maps or if its a high end could have all new maps for it.  It could shorten the life of the engine slightly just due to extra stress but not dramatically or even anything worth worrying about.|`|RTBvQJHbaa	The chip seller should be able to answer.  Some require a higher grade of gas and a performance exhaust, intake, ignition, and lower temp thermostat.|`|AHygXkmfaa	It depends entirely on the programming of the chip.<br>  <br>  eg. If joe blow had an eprom chip burned for his 93 Turbo AWD Eclipse, that runs 28 pounds of boost with forged 9:1 pistons, a JMfab manifold, 1200cc Fuel Injector Clinic low-Z injectors, 4" exhaust out the fender, and a giant ball bearing Holset turbo that feeds on small pets, you would NOT want to run that particular chip in your unmodified car. It would run so lean that your pistons would melt, and the timing curve would be so conservative that you would have a considerable decrease in power even if you could get the right air fuel ratio.|`|JFqcr5Ggaa	NO <br>  GO.....    BULLY DOG.COM<br>  IT WILL RUN YOU ABOUT 400.00<br>  WELL WORTH IT <br>  I HAVE A 4X4 DODGE  350  MY MILEAGE WENT UP PER GALLON<br>  GO FOR IT!
YLajQcFkaa	Well you covered the first thing to do well.  Check all the vac hoses between the engine and the firewall if not that then ANY of the following is possible.  <br>  Sounds like the computer went on a vacation.  OR the little control box under the black plastic cover over the radiator is bad.  But then again it can be the MAP sensor.  I'ed start with the MAP sensor thats on the fire wall on the passenger side more toward the middle.|`|hRDHF6SEaa	you have gas in your oil.when you pull the dipstick oil drip rite off.spend a few and get a compression pressure check.you have one or more bad piston rings.if so with a ford,buy a for sale sign.|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	Ok...a tune up and fuel injection service may help some about the black smoke.<br>  <br>  But gas in the oil means you've got problems and those problems may be pricey to fix. <br>  <br>  Fuel pressure regulator is out on the car.|`|bvCkplELaa	I'd look at the O2 sensors, they wont set a code on a car that old with Obd1. Glad to Finally see someone on this site that has common sense enough to know what KOEO is. Good luck man.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Sounds like something has gone horribly wrong with the emission reduction system or your cold starter injector is stuck on.|`|RTBvQJHbaa	Bad engine compression rings on piston, or leaking fuel injectors.
o5KbZk1saa	Who cares what others think. Sounds to me that the hang -up is their problem not yours. You did nothing wrong.<br>  Go for it. <br>  <br>  see ya there<br>  <br>  <br>  russ|`|246c4887a1d51a98dcfd5795d476a2fcaa	Why not? She's going to have to start getting on with her life .... And it's probably going to be hard to keep trying to avoid people that she and her EX both knew and liked. I say go to the Air show and enjoy yourself!|`|yrit570Jaa	don't worry about rest of people, and what they think, because they are going to think about it anyway. go and enjoy yourself. you may even find another man.|`|AA11452160	Don't forget the sunblock!!  :)  Have fun!|`|OcCMzT0uaa	Go. If you run into him, give a courtesy hug, look him in the eye and say "have a good time". Then go on your merry way and enjoy! You are both ADULTS aren't you?
0TiCSGKtaa	ask the person teaching you to drive while they are in the car with you|`|3sWAdwcfaa	i dnt want to sound dumb but i learned a little from toy cars, make a parking lot and try to park the car without lifting it or sliding it. visualize that in you head next time you try to park.|`|m1F3SRlWaa	leave lots of space between you and the spot like hug the other side of the row of cars or something then turn it hard and straighten it out. if your to close you will go in weird or maybe not fit
0TiCSGKtaa	the clock spring has to do with your airbag and to replace it you have to remove the steering wheel airbag cover and the airbag make sure you disc the battery b4 you do it or you might deploy the bag<br>  <br>  best advise have a profesional fix the vehicle.
