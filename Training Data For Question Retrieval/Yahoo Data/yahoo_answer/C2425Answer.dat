MeDMU4uAaa	just do loads of different things i do     tap (Which is quite hard to become gd at unless your really dedicated)  jazz ( which is really fun)  ballet (amazing love it but probabley hard to learn through a pc :D)  contempory( really really fun)  bhangra ( its a kind of belly dancing sort of )  and rock and roll (which there aren't many classes for and i don't think youtube will have much of that :D)     i think if you just try lots of different ones then you can find one which you might find easier or more challenging for you and it will be more fun :D    Good luck :D xx    btw i think you'd have to work really hard to try and look masculine so i wouldn't worry about that    and also i'm 14 as well|`|TdIx5uRLaa	im a 14 year old girl  i do street/jazz|`|KouNp7yUaa	you should learn how to break dance and like spin on your head and stuff that would be so cool|`|wkuCydzRaa	if your 'more street' then surely the anwser is simple. Street dancing?|`|oKWe4rueaa	Guarantee you'll love this...and there are great tutorials on youtube!! I'm 15 and I got all my friends doing this at school & it was great fun...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHKrZ0E6e...    Jumpstyle!!|`|cz97QmpTaa	Break dance, Hip hop...  i want to learn hip hop in Viet Nam. I'm Vietnamese|`|TEGL1HPUaa	First off....you don't have enough testosterone in your body to look "too" masculine. Expert Village on youtube has really good beginner videos that break down lots of good steps together that you can put together yourself.  Just remember that when danceing...everything is by the count of 8!!|`|r5hNoQAgaa	I would say - HipHop Or Street|`|JMEghB3Zaa	if ur more street why not take street dancing or hiphop? a 14 year old can take any kind of dance she wants. So just take what u think u would enjoy.|`|6aw3naCNaa	Hip hop/ disco!!|`|OTxCCXa5aa	Just do what you think is best! There's no point in doing something if you don't enjoy it!|`|rYX6Owfraa	Belly dancing!!|`|FI4Z0jYcaa	If you don't want to look all "masculine" then I would suggest Jazz.  It comprises of less punishing (sudden) moves and change of directions, but still has the street edge where you can perform it alongside street and break dance, and along with the hip-hop beats of today.|`|7atxRdXeaa	If I had to choose, it would probably be hip hop or street. Just do what you think is the best. Make sure you enjoy it as well. No point in doing something that you don't like. Join a club in school or in your local area might help other than using the web.     Hope this helps :)
U5aJy4Skaa	That sounds like a really fun class. There are really several ways to improve musical talent. Oviously the first one is the one that everyone says, which is to practice, as much as you can whenever you can. That is the key to directly improve yourself. Another thing you can do is observe other musicians. Maybe watch the techinques of the other people in your class, and get influenced by them. Or maybe watch a professional performer that you like, and pick up on something they do that you like. Sometimes you can amaze yourself with learning new things just by watching those around you. But don't ever stop singing out in class. Doing what you love, and having confidence over what you do is really a very powerful tool. A lot of people who might have incredible talents, can't let them shine out sometimes because they get nervous or are worried about their ablilties. Let your talents show, and you won't have to worry, because you will be good. A show of confidence and pride in your art is a natural born talent and with it you will be just as good as the other kids in your class, and maybe even better.  I hope I could help.|`|3PbKeg2uaa	Try to use more of your chestvoice which is often used for Pop andRB singers,and pull your stomach in with every few notes. nothing to worry about because if you were in Choir/Chorus,you are used to using your headvoice so you can blend in with  the choir and not be so powerful.
63TLmh8uaa	Illustrator doesn't really deal in dpi. It's a vector program meaning that it uses points and curves. When you save things for web, you can adjust the dpi there; and when you create a new document you can set the raster effects for dpi. But that's all I know of that you can do in regards to dpi settings in Illustrator. Maybe I'm just not well informed, though...
km1vuLUzaa	the good ones. [=<br>  btw i really hope Carlisle exists so he can adopt me lol<br>  i'd love to be able to stop the time, rewind or forward it|`|m33uUyRYaa	i would be like the cullens and i think i would want to either be a shield like bella or be able to read peoples minds those seem very useful and seeing in the future would upset me :)|`|Z19gRYZwaa	Knowing myself, probably like the Cullens, since I don't have the mindset for killing people offhand. Also it would let me live somewhere more permanently (just because most of the good vampires in the books are flat and shallow doesn't mean I would be). I would want to be able to see other people's memories: I like trying to figure people out, and as such it would be enormously convenient. Probably only if they I touched them or something though, rather than just seeing them all the time.|`|AA10209040	Those aren't vampires. They're just cold stone-creatures who drink blood. Look up "vampire" in the dictionary.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	I know you don't want to hear it, but this is a pretty silly question. I mean, what's the point?|`|SYKGIiQkaa	I would be exactly like a vampire should. Kill and eat hookers, and die if I step into the sun light.|`|Re2wzUO0aa	I think I would strive to be like the Cullens but then again I would want to check out the dark side. Hopefully like the Cullens. And power hmmm... I like Bella's the best. But we must remember that its just fiction and not real. But i do love the series. And Vampire books in general.|`|SJvbro3Uaa	I think i would be A good vampire, But it would probably be very difficult for me. I give in to things way too much. I think i'd behave like jasper does.<br>  <br>  I would really like to be able to control peoples emotions. That would be pretty sweet =]|`|WfbZrIRDaa	i would want mind reading.<br>  or alice's power of seeing the future.!<br>  <br>  -Shay?|`|TOAiSbPYaa	Good like my family.<br>  If I could have any power it would be to hmmm...read minds like Edward or I cant pick between Renesmee's power and Alice's, lol it would be cool to have eather or tho.<br>  <br>  <br>  Esme Cullen|`|8PchhhIIaa	i would also do what any vampire does kill but who knows i dont realy think of that!!!

MlZay5VHaa	I'd choose Jacob because Edward's big mistake is overreaction. It's in his nature to be too extreme. He's a very all-or-nothing kind of person, and it makes him unreasonable. In the beginning of Eclipse, he's too overprotective. When he sees the error of his ways, he goes too far in the other direction. He could have chosen a middle groundmaybe admitted to his jealousy and asked Bella to choose him, rather than watching her get in deeper with Jacob. Of course, he has other issues that make forcing this issue problematic. What if Jacob is better for her? What if Bella could have a more complete life with him? Should Edward really insist that Bella give everything up for vampire life? Or would it be better to let her make a fully informed choice? Can you see his dilemma? Part of Edward wants Bella to choose Jacob.    Jacob doesn't have a tragic flaw. He has one goal and one hope. His goal is to save Bella's life. His hope is that he'll win her heart in the process. He fails at both. But that doesn't mean he regrets trying. If he could do it over again, he'd do the same thing. Jacob couldn't live with himself if he didn't give saving Bella his best efforthe knows it's going to hurt when he loses, but he knows it would hurt worse if he didn't try. Does he do everything right? Heck, no! But he's sixteen and he's making it up as he goes along. Those who are upset by some of his tactics should consider his youth and the fact that he is, after all, right. Bella is in love with him. (In the end, it's truly healthier for her to be aware of this as she goes forward with unalterable decisions.) Also, I like Jacob because he doesn't baby Bella like Edward does. Jacob knows that Bella is capable of handling dangerous situations. I wouldn't want my boyfriend treating me like a helpless kid would you?    Oh I almost forgot. There is a downside to choosing Jacob. If Bella chose Jacob instead of Edward, she would always have to worry about Jacob imprinting later on. What if he did imprint on someone else? Even though Jacob said that if he did imprint he wouldn't leave Bella, if he did end up imprinting, he would have no choice but to do just that: leave Bella. It happened to Sam. What makes you think that Jacob's situation would be different?    Edward manipulated Bella into marrying him. You should NOT get married unless it is something that you wholeheartedly want to do. Edward knows that she doesn't want to get married, but he uses sex as a bargaining tool to get her to marry him! Jake is also a bit manipulative. He manipulated Bella into asking him to kiss her, but this is good for her in the end because she accepts the fact that she loves him.  Edward is way too controlling over Bella. He dismantles her car and forcefully prevents her from visiting Jake and he makes his sister kidnap her. Jacob always gives Bella a choice in every matter and he never forces her to do anything (except kiss him lol which is pretty bad.)  Edward is WAY too overprotective. He never gives Bella any space and he always has to be her eyes and her brain and her hands and her legs...you get my point. He never lets Bella solve her own problems, while Jacob lets Bella have fun and take risks.  Edward doesn't care about those around him. Like in New Moon when he decides to pull a Romeo and kill himself. He knows that his death will devastate his family, yet he attempts to get himself killed anyway. Jacob cares for his family. He takes care of his Dad all the time and he would never abandon him for a long period of time (he left once but only for a little while).    ****BREAKING DAWN SPOILER BELOW****      A lot of people say they hate Jake because he imprinted of Renesmee, and I have to come to Jacob's defense here. First of all, it's not his fault that he imprinted on a child. A werewolf never gets to choose who he imprints on. Take Sam for example. He loved Leah before he loved Emily. If he had the ability to choose to imprint on someone, he would've chosen Leah long before Emily came into the picture. Secondly, imprinting on a child doesn't mean that Jacob is attracted to that child in a romantic or a sexual way. It just means that he wants with all his heart to protect that child and to make her happy....like a really loving big brother. Jacob won't have any romantic feelings towards Renesmee for a VERY long time. Meyer clearly states this in New Moon and on her website.|`|0K9p9OPfaa	TEAM EDWARD!!!  OCD= obssessive cullen disorder.|`|5t0DYU6Baa	I love Jasper,  Emmett and Edward.  Carlisle is okay too.|`|bfw1AtAtaa	Jacob is my favorite character in the whole book.  He kicks butt|`|lGF9GpI1aa	Jacob might have to be my absolute favorite... until 'Breaking Dawn' where he sorta creeps me out. I love Emmett is all of the books. And Jasper. Edward has just never been my favorite. I think I just never got over that he left Bella in 'New Moon'.|`|SFxQyTfJaa	Edward of cause ;D  I hate Jacob .... Especially in the movie...  Carlisle is also a good character ^^  But I like Emmet more than Jasper ( also when Jasper looks much better in movie)..Emmet is more...funny ^^|`|nikli8fyaa	Favorite in general? Or between Edward and Emmet? I definitely love Edward(i'm a fanatic too, my freinds are scared of me), But am oddly attracted to Jasper. Especially in the movie. Can you say HOT??!!!

You are only are in high school once so don't miss out on the fun things just because of other people.|`|G2mJppm0aa	.... You came online for a moral question?

People may ask you to go or ask why not, but that is about it.

Good Luck!|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Send them round to all the reputable agencies in the country. If you're right for modelling then you'll be taken on. If you're not taken on by a single reputable agency then you'll have to accept you haven't got the right look for it (and it's not about being "pretty").  You can just send snap shots to agencies and they'll be able to tell whether you have the right look. You don't need professional photos. If you get a contract they'll arrange a portfolio for you. Or you could find out whether they do walk ins, and just travel round the agencies in person.    P.S. Don't ever pay money to register with an agency. Agencies who ask for money are DODGY and you could end up meeting some very unsavoury characters.

It is for a second soprano, I think. I went to a performing arts camp this summer, and sang a solo of that song, and a lot of the instructors loved that musical in general.<br>  <br>  Then again, it is a very common audition song, so I would sing it depending on how competitive the camp is.<br>  <br>  Just look around YouTube or something for different musicals. As far as other songs go, I suggest older songs. (That's what my choral director told me before I auditioned).<br>  <br>  Hopefully I helped, and good luck!|`|aLXvhSNKaa	I agree that On My Own from Les Miserables is a very good audition song.

Even if you aren't into the vampires and all, I think you could like it, because I never liked vampires, just Harry Potter. At first, I thought twilight was stupid, but when I actually read it, I really liked it. One of the girls above is right.

And no 18 is not an old age to read Twilight. There are moms that 30 and 40 reading this book. Twilight appeals to all ages. So run to your library and check out this book.

I mean, I kept on falling asleep. And I'm not exaggerating or anything.<br>  <br>  As for Harry Potter, I have all 7 audiobooks on my iPod and whenever I get bored I listen to them.

My advice would be to write a letter or contact one of the magazine designers to ask for an informal interview ~ or ask if you could spend a day "interning" for them so you could see what the job entails.  Wish you the best :)|`|0qYY7cdzaa	I'm not a photographer there, but I have done work for them and other travel magazines.<br>  If you are interested you need to be familiar with the company, their magazine and the website. They are kind enough to provide portfolio submission information online and they are listed in 'Photographer's Market'.

It is the imperfections that make people so wonderful.<br>  <br>  i found the guy of my dreams, who was everything i ever longed for, so there is hope!|`|KJt9XSY4aa	I've done the same thing.

She has just started seventh grade at Elston Prep, and she and her best friend Stacey aren't getting along. Stacy is all caught up in who's wearing what to whose Bar Mitzvah, and has even become friends with Annabella and Pia, two of the biggest snobs at Elston! At home, things are no better: there's a new mother's helper to contend with, and Penelope's little brother Nathaniel just won't leave her alone. And when her parents are at home — which is rare — all they do is fight. <br>  <br>  I really like this book because im in 7th grade, I can really relate to her. this is a "teen" book but w/e its fine to me, it teaches how kids feel and i just like it. read it!|`|NhPSz1kHaa	Dracula by Bram Stoker and others listed at<br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/vampiretales" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/vampiretales</a><br>  <br>  anything by Sarah Dessen, Ann Brashares, Meg Cabot, Jodi Picoult, Nicholas Sparks, Ellen Hopkins, or Laurie Halse Anderson - Titles at the 1st link below.<br>  <br>  Go Ask Alice by Anonymous<br>  The Perks of Being a Wallflower<br>  13 Reason Why by Jay Asher<br>  The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold<br>  A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith<br>  Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger<br>  A Separate Peace by John Knowles<br>  Looking for Alaska by John Green<br>  <br>  Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier<br>  The Other Boleyn Girl and others by Philippa Gregory<br>  The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan<br>  I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou<br>  The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency by Alexander McCall Smith<br>  The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd<br>  <br>  Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell<br>  Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy<br>  Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, Persuasion, and Mansfield Park by Jane Austen<br>  Wuthering Heights by Emily Bronte<br>  Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte<br>  Little Women, Little Men, and Jo's Boys by Louisa May Alcott<br>  My Antonia by Willa Cather<br>  The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne<br>  <br>  The Wee Free Men, A Hat Full of Sky, and Wintersmith by Terry Pratchett<br>  The Belgariad and The Mallorean by David Eddings<br>  The Chronicles of Narnia by CS Lewis<br>  The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings Trilogy by JRR Tolkien<br>  Odd Thomas series by Dean Koontz<br>  Inkheart series by Cornelia Funke<br>  Fablehaven series by Brandon Mull<br>  Eragon, Eldest, and Brisingr by Christopher Paolini<br>  Storms of Vengeance by John Beachem<br>  Wake and Fade by Lisa McMann<br>  The Giver and sequels by Lois Lowry<br>  A Great and Terrible Beauty and sequels by Libba Bray<br>  Howl's Moving Castle<br>  Maxiumum Ride series by James Patterson<br>  Pendragon series by DJ MacHale<br>  <br>  anything by Anne McCaffrey, Andre Norton, Ursula K.

You could try the popularized "Twilight".. or I like "The Rescue" by Nicholas Sparks.. it's slow at first, but it's good once you get into it.

Some of them, like Harry Potter, are so descriptive, that when I stopped reading it, i felt awkward. The Shopaholic Series is just so modern, and realistic, like any of it could happen. Pride and Prejudice is just a classic, and Twilight is slightly sexy, to a point where, frankly, it's too much. Anyway, these are the reasons I love all of these books! <br>  <br>  I hope it answered your question!|`|pLirJP9Taa	I love all of Sarah Dessen's books. Obviously I am a huge Twilight freak, so all of those books are my favorites. I love the author Eddie de Oliveira, also Melissa de la Cruz's Blue Blood's series. There is a new vampire series called Evernight, which is the first book, and the second one is coming out soon. Kevin Brooks is also a good author. He writes this really good book called Martin Pyg. Anne Rice's novels are good, such as her Vampire series.|`|M7PikLeOaa	Twilight series or Harry potter series :)<br>  <br>  I like the twilight series just because it's so cute and sweet and keeps your interest ALL the way through and i love harry potter because when i read it and then stop i feel almost disoriented like i wonder where i am..kind of like when you're sleeping over at a friend's and you wake up in the morning and you're like where am I?..kinda like that. it takes me to hogwarts :)|`|DgAOboZNaa	The twilight series and the harry potter series. I find myself hooked to them by the light of my alarm clock an hour after bedtime. I think it is because they have a lot f action and they are interesting. Vampires, werewolves, wizards...

The way he has been treated has done much to make him what he is, as he explains, and not just in that famous "Hath not..." speech.<br>  <br>  BTW, did you notice how, well after Antonio has been saved, they change the rules on him?<br>  <br>  Go read the play, with this and the other answers in mind.|`|dlJpSnBiaa	i think shylock is a victim because he is forced to change his religion by way of a unfair trial, he hates christians because he has been wrongly treated by them for example when Antonio spat in his face and he always calls him a dog and such. He puts his ducats before his daughter  because they are his livelihood without them he has no job because at the time of the play in venice if you were a jew then the only profession you could up hold was that of a money lender<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope ive helped|`|jE5TI4zqaa	Shylock may not have the best intentions, but he is certainly not a complete villain, and the other characters, such as Antonio and Bassanio are guilty too. You have to understand that Shylock, like Dickens' Fagin in Oliver Twist, represents a nation of people oppressed and humilated by the society in which they live. Shylock hates Christians not for their religion and beliefs but for their actions towards him and his people: Christians forced them to live in ghettos under strict rules; Jews were forced to become money-lenders (no other jobs were made available to them) and then made into criminals for doing so; in some places (including Rome) they were even hanged for merely being Jewish. This was all due to the misconception that all Jews had killed Jesus, due to Judas Iscariot, etc. About his daughter and the ducats, this may be due to grief. In devout Judaism, a child is proclaimed as dead if they marry out of the religion, as this is not allowed. To Shylock, Jessica's act would have been of greatest deceit and shame. It becomes perhaps more understandable that he wanted human flesh, in return for all the human flesh he may have believed the Christians had cost him and the Jews in these centuries. It is impossible to tell if Shakespeare is representing 16th Century Europe as disgustingly anti-semitic or if he was actually anti-semitic himself.

YA36FUf1aa	I'm not sure but I certainly agree with you. I got into a debate over this when I dabbled in classics and it would appear that many people hadn't even thought of it before. I interpret the whole story as sympathetic to her in that her actions are easily understandable but unfortunately, most of the texts around the myth tend to use language which says the opposite.|`|NR3YnkVPaa	Well, there is a difference between "killing" and sacrificing (especially when it is at the demand of a goddess). Also, there is the variant story that she really wasn't killed, but rescued at the last moment by the goddess and spirited away to Taurus (I think). It has some similarities with the story of Isaac in the bible. So this doesn't make her look too good. Plus the way she killed Agamemnon leaves something to be desired (and all of his trusty men, too). Adding to her down sides, she hooked up with Aegisthus mighty quickly (adultery) who was his cousin. <br>  And she was killed by her own son. She doesn't get much sympathy for some pretty good reasons. HOWEVER, that just makes it that much more of a challenge. None of the above mentioned is insurmountable to a talented writer and imaginer. I'd say go for it.

0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	Between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot (18 m) carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history. These presidents were selected by Borglum because of their role in preserving the Republic and expanding its territory.[8][10] The image of Thomas Jefferson was originally intended to appear in the area at Washington's right, but after the work there was begun, the rock was found to be unsuitable, so the work on the Jefferson figure was dynamited, and a new figure was sculpted to Washington's left.[8]<br>  <br>  In 1933, the National Park Service took Mount Rushmore under its jurisdiction. Engineer Julian Spotts helped with the project by improving its infrastructure. For example, he had the tram upgraded so that it could reach the top of Mount Rushmore for the ease of workers. By July 4, 1934, Washington's face had been completed and was dedicated. The face of Thomas Jefferson was dedicated in 1936, and the face of Abraham Lincoln was dedicated on September 17, 1937. In 1937, a bill was introduced in Congress to add the head of civil-rights leader Susan B. Anthony, but a rider was passed on an appropriations bill requiring that federal funds be used to finish only those heads that had already been started at that time.[11] In 1939, the face of Theodore Roosevelt was dedicated.|`|wqadTarpaa	ur face|`|bdnMQnVHaa	Artistic purposes.|`|eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	Just the way the rocks were.<br>  Between October 4, 1927, and October 31, 1941, Gutzon Borglum and 400 workers sculpted the colossal 60-foot (18 m) carvings of U.S. presidents George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln to represent the first 150 years of American history.

8asG4WCwaa	Well, first off, you are unlikely to find self-published books on the shelves at a book store. iUniverse is a self publsiher.<br>  <br>  Book stores actually make the most off the sale a book, but it's not all profit.<br>  <br>  Let's say the book retails to the reader for $20.  Bookstores buy books for the wholesale price (50% of retail is average).  Some chain stores get an even bigger discount because of the sheer volume of sales they can achieve.<br>  <br>  The store sells the book for $20.  They make $10"profit"  out of which they have to pay overhead expenses like building costs, utilities, phone, salaries, advertising, etc.  Unsold books can be returned for credit (except with self published books, one of many reasons bookstores do not carry them). Actual profit after expenses is about $2 per book sold, if they are lucky. <br>  <br>  The wholesaler, if separate from the publisher, makes his share (10%) out of which he has to pay his expenses (warehouse, trucks, cartons, gasoline, salaries, etc). Unsold books can be returned for credit (except with self published books).  His profit is about 50 cents per book, if he's lucky.<br>  <br>  The publisher is left with 40% of the retail price.  Out of that he has to pay his overhead expenses - building costs, utilities, salaries, equipment maintenance, production supplies, and royalties.  He has to buy back those returned books, too.  Some of those can be pulped and recycled.  Others can be wholesaled to places like half-price books (for about 10% of the cover price). If the author gets 15%, that $3 per book sold out of which you have to pay your bills (and returns are charged back agsinst royalties, but not the advance, which means if you have earned out your advance and are earning royalties, books returned for credit are subtracted from your next earnings), leaving the publisher with a free profit of about $1.50 per book, if he's lucky.<br>  <br>  For most authors, that $3 a book is a loss if they expect to be able to pay all their expenses with it. That's why most authors have jobs outside of writing (or spouses with jobs).  Until your sales make your royalties enough to pay you bills, it's more bonus money to buy the extras - which, truth be told, should go right back into your writing (computer upgrades, covention attendance, etc).  Let you books pay their share of the writing costs (which self published books do not do for you).<br>  <br>  For the publisher, books that sell well often earn enough to help cover the expenses/losses of poor selling books.  Too many "loosers" and there are serious problems.  <br>  <br>  For a self published book, after the store gets their cut, and you pay whatever your expenses will be (which will be higher than a traditional publisher because you are not dealing in large enough numbers to be cost effective), you would get the remaining 20%-40%.  Unfortunately, since few book stores will carry self published books, your actual sales are slim to none, making 40% of nothing is still nothing.<br>  <br>  Being "available to order online" with a self-publishing POD, does cut the actual expenses of warehousing down, but since printing one book at a time raises it's production and distribution costs, the book can end up retailing for $30, which makes the so called savings worthless.  The book costs more than you theorhetically saved.<br>  <br>  Most self published titles sell less than 50 copies ever.  The have limited distribution possibilities unless the author wants to spend even more money doing his own advertising.  That $2000 to print the books is less than a quater of what promoting it will cost (advertisement is expensive, attending book faires is expensive, shipping copies to chain store reviewers/buyers is expensive).  You can easy sink $10,000 into it.<br>  <br>  Traditional books generally sell over 1000 copies.  They do not cost the author anything in production, advertisiement or distribution, plus, the publisher pays the author an advance on royalties.  You can make $2000 to $10,000, with traditional publishing instead of spending it on self publishing.  <br>  <br>  Welcome to the realities of publishing :-)|`|wYF6U6qlaa	But look at all the work the publisher does that the author could not do on their own.  Those thousands of books don't print themselves, advertise themselves, bind themselves, transport themselves, etc.  Plus, if the books on the shelves don't get sold, the author doesn't end up losing tens of thousands of dollars and or storing 10,000 unread books in their guest bedroom.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The bottom line is that if you're publishing for profit,  self-publishing is not an alternative to commercial publishing.  The single author simply does not have the resources to move the quantity of books a publisher does, or make the investment or take the risks.  Self-publishing buys you the satisfaction of seeing your work in print - but YOU are the consumer, putting money in someone else's hands.  I'm not saying it doesn't have a place in the publishing world.  If you labor over a piece of work for months, you deserve to see it in print, who cares if some corporate bigwig thinks it's 'marketable' or not? If that's the case, go for it!!!<br>  <br>  In my opinion, anyone who tells you that you should self-publish to 'keep those greedy publishers and agents out of your honey-pot' either doesn't know what they're talking about or are defending their own decision to self-publish.|`|w3uYxwiraa	The publishers typically get 90%.<br>  <br>  Stinks, huh?
i0rKPYLJaa	No, it's not from the book. They're just being stupid and trying to make it funny, when it should be DARK. But to the first person who posted, it's actually "SHE'S only interested in you," but for this one sneak peak they did in Japan when they were focusing on Slughorn, they cut the S and made it "He's only interested in you..." to show that Slughorn only wants Harry in his Slug Club because Harry is famous.<br>  <br>  And what in the world are you talking about, person above? The movies have never been M. The last ones were rated PG 13 but they rated HBP PG, which is really dumb because the books get DARKER as they go. But they are cutting out a lot scenes, like Dumbledore's funeral and stuff. They are being idiots.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	No, its not in the book.<br>  <br>  The thing is, they chopped up the scene for the trailer, and hermione is actually saying "HE'S only interested because HE thinks youre the chosen one" which is referring to Slughorn|`|MMmv06Ynaa	its not, the producers have tried to make a funny remark in the movie. i am actually very suprised that the movie is only rated PG 13 +, it has always been an M, except for the Philosopher's Stone.
Ne2l5qrEaa	The actual death certificate will not be on-line.<br>  <br>  A certified copy of his death certificate can be obtained from the  Health/Vital Statistics Department of the State in which he died, via a request and the cost.<br>  Each State has a website, containing rules and regulations concerning the purchase of a death certificate and who is allowed to do so, as well as on-line ordering.<br>  <br>  The funeral home usually supplies the immediate family (spouse, child/children or legal representative) with certified copies, with the cost added to the cost of the funeral.<br>  <br>  The Social Security Death Index (on-line) is free, but it only shows a small amount of info, cause of death not being one of them.<br>  It takes a while for more recent deaths to be posted.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to contact the family member who has a certified copy and ask him/her to send you a copy.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I couldn't be of more help.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Unless you put it in your question, we can't tell what country you are in. It is the most frustrating thing Yahoo does. It doesn't matter if you go into domestic (USA) Yahoo, Yahoo UK, Yahoo Australia, Yahoo India, etc., all of the questions in English go into one big "pot".<br>  <br>  In the USA, if the SSA paid burial benefits, he will show up on the SSDI<br>  <a href="http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bi...</a><br>  in a couple of months.<br>  <br>  The newspaper in the town he was living in at the time of his death may run an obituary, which may be on-line for 7, 30, 90 or 365 days after the death. Note that is the town he was living in; if he lived in Beloit and died while on vacation in Maui, the Beloit newspaper is the place to look. Look quick, in case they are a 7-day newspaper.<br>  <br>  A "Death Record" usually means a Death Certificate with a notary's seal, that you use to sell his car, open his safe deposit box, take possession of his house (until probate settles), etc, if you are the next of kin. I suspect you don't mean that. If you did, you have to buy a copy from the county clerk. It is one of the saddest purchases you will ever make.<br>  <br>  You have my sympathy.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I am very sorry for your loss, and you are right.. it can be very hard to accept. The notice in the paper (obit) is normally the first record and was normally used to allow people to attend the services. Filing the death certificate is handled by the funeral home.. who sends the information to the state, and the official document takes a while to be issued. The death certificate won't be online, dear. <br>  All of us that have been where you are right now, send you our hugs.|`|mcpu4ZDtaa	Hi there!<br>  <br>  Oh condolence if it's really true, sorry to hear that. I know how it feels when someone passed away especially if he's really close to you.<br>  <br>  Ahmmm... I'm sorry to inform you but I guess there's no free site where you can have or view the death records of anyone. <br>  <br>  But I would recommend Web Detective <a href="http://www.web-detective.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.web-detective.com/</a><br>  It's internet' #1 investigative source since 1995. Most professionals used this and even private investigator. By using Web Detective you'll be able to view and get the death record of someone. <br>  <br>  I tried this site since last year and I was amazed on how easy this site to use. In less than a minute I can have all the information I needed. <br>  Juts give it a try. <br>  <br>  Best of luck!

Who said it is? Why did they say that? If your the the perpetrator, it is not bad, if you are the victim you can probably think of many reasons. I can't think of any. Darwin.
Hzf3QK9faa	That's pretty normal considering your life sounds like it is in transition. Some of it starts in your emotions before you know what to change concretely. It is a waiting and holding pattern. Waiting on God for some answers and pieces to your puzzle so you can progress. Life isin't just a destination it is a journey. Try to enjoy something each day and it might help the process not feel so blecch!|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Yes, I've been hovering around my life for a year now. Time to pick myself up by the bootstraps and get on with it.|`|t9htoO50aa	I know what you mean. I went through that before I met my wife. Don't let it get you down there are better times ahead.|`|mggll8dRaa	No, I cruising ahead....!!|`|b08f23f64cf67ed7e34f8ed0781dfd16aa	Ohh yea, definitely. When I moved half way across the world from where I grew up everyone was new and I couldn't keep up with them. I hated where I lived, I made no friends and I did bad in school after having everything before I moved. I was an honor student, had lots of friends, I was happy. So it took me a really really long time to get over.<br>  <br>  At times I felt like it was so surreal, I didn't know what to do anymore, it felt like I kept going in circles and winding up int he same place.<br>  <br>  I couldn't leave the past behind, therefore I just didn't care about my life for awhile and everything was passing by and I was still not over the past. It took me about 4 yrs to get over unfortunately, but now I'm doing a lot better and I realize that I should have stood up to do something about it.. I regret it now, but then I also realize that the more circles you go through, you actually learn more and more and get stronger.. and feel pain as such.<br>  <br>  I hope I'm answering this the right way, but I do know how it feels.|`|aT5jaFX8aa	I know what you mean. Like yesterday, there was so much to do. You were stressed, worried there wouldn't be enough time. You get through the day. The next couple days, its like everything stopped. <br>  <br>  You don't know what to do with yourself, you keep remembering things that happened, and its like, oh! lets go do that. But once you start doing it, its just not right any more. You feel like everyone around you is doing something, and you just can't. Your in slow mo. Its a horrible feeling, I've been feeling like that for a week now. Its not depression, but its just like a sad, dark cloud over me.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	I do feel like that but i know why .. it's because i'm taking a year off before going to college and it seems like a bad idea now ...hmmm<br>  do you relate to this<br>  "I'm fifteen years old<br>  And I feel it's already too late to live."<br>   its some lyrics from M83 graveyard girl .. i feel this way but I'm not 15..

I called it being a human but not a human being.  You need to find a way to connect with life and to become involved in feeling it and being alive.  For me, finding ways to communicate in an honest and valid way and finding people who encouraged me to be what I truly was --not what others expected me to be-- was my answer for feeling more connected to life and to feel like I was again onboard its moving progess.|`|sGhEl7YSaa	yep, but I just figure things are in motion just moving very slowly. so be patient and make sure your doing what you can to move tord your goals in life. And definitely set goals no matter how small and you will feel you start moving again, even if it is slow motion.|`|9eMJsBoZaa	Kinda need more information. Are you not getting anywhere with your career or relationships? That could make you feel like life is passing you by as you watch other people advance in their lives.|`|yOK32PM9aa	Yes, everyone does.

G2mJppm0aa	I was on the dance team in high school and a judge when I graduated. Lots of fun, bring a certain uniqueness to the table, that they couldn't refuse, make sure not to involve your personal life, as well as vendettas, be easy going and bring school spirit, and a great personality. <br>  <br>  Makes sure you have great facials when you perform and look at your crowd, and don't be scared to mess up, if you do mess up make sure not to let the judges know. <br>  <br>  Jazz and Hip Hop will help the most. Lyrical if the team is really technical. <br>  <br>  We had our own style, it was jazz funk with elements of choreography, when we went to a competition, they didn't know how to categorize us.|`|xnDcmV1xaa	I would back up those choices..<br>  <br>  Jazz, Hip Hop, and Lyrical would all probably help.<br>  <br>  However, I'm not an expert at this because my school does not have any kind of dance team lol. :)<br>  <br>  I am just guessing this from years of dance lessons.<br>  <br>  Good luck making the team :)

rOY2J0UAaa	In 1893 women in NZ won the right to vote. following this in 1919 women were eligble to be elected to parliament, and in 1933 Elizabeth McCombs was the first woman elected to parliament. <br>  <br>  A petition favouring women's suffrage was presented to parliament by the Women's Christian Temperance Union in 1891. The following year another petition was presented to parliament which was much larger than the fist, then finally in 1893 a third petition was presented and finally passed, giving women full rights to vote.|`|AwjmyLJcaa	I believe the first female member of the New Zealand Parliament was Elizabeth McCombs elected in 1933.

jA1nfMeyaa	They can't just fly up, because the eagles they were divine and sent from Valinor by Manwe to watch over Morgoth (the original badass of Middle-Earth).  Like Gandalf, being of a divine nature they CANNOT take matters into their own hands and dictate the fate of the inhabitants of Middle-Earth.  It is up to the people of Middle-Earth to decide upon their own fate.  The Maiar can only aid and advise them, but they are forbidden from doing anything huge that would change the tide in their favor and dictate the fate of Middle-Earth.  <br>  <br>  They can do things every once in a while, like saving Gandalf at Isengard, but going off to destroy the Ring is the responsibility of the people of Middle-Earth, not the "gods."  Once the Ring was destroyed, then it was okay to go there to save Sam and Frodo.<br>  <br>  The Lord of the Rings doesn't go much into the history and mythology of Tolkien's world.  This stuff is better explained in the Silmarillion and his other works.|`|w3uYxwiraa	There were evil winged thingies.

W1h3w5gdaa	As someone who is already in the music business, let me say "Welcome!" The first step is deciding that this is your chosen career path and dedicating yourself to the goal.<br>  <br>  Being in the business can mean a great many things, however. Are you wanting only to perform, or would you like to learn the recording, engineering, producing, promoting aspects as well?<br>  <br>  I'll tell you what. The best thing I can do for you is put you in touch with the guy who launched my career. His name is David McLean and his website is <a href="http://www.skinnydevil.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.skinnydevil.com.</a>  A direct link to the Careers page is <a href="http://www.skinnydevil.com/jobs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinnydevil.com/jobs.html</a><br>  <br>  Now, if you're looking only at being a performer, than my advice is simple: Get really good and get really busy. The ones who make it are the ones who work the hardest. (I stole that line from David.)<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope to see you out there!|`|zN2w981naa	First, work on a demo and then get yourself a manager.

La llegada de Cristóbal Colón supuso el comienzo de la conquista de América, cuya primera campa?a fue la de Cuba por Velázquez, a la que siguió la del Imperio Mexica por Cortés, la del Inca por Pizarro,etc hasta su finalización definitiva tras los decretos de Felipe II de abolición de la conquista. A partir de aquí comenzará la llamada colonizacion de América, abierta por holandeses, franceses,etc, cuya diferencia radica en el hecho de no establecerse por campa?as, sino por factorías de interés comercial(contrario a la Monarquía Hispánica, con deseos de crear otras Espa?as en todos los sentidos, tanto jurídicamente, administrativamente,etc.)<br>  <br>  El contagio de las enfermedades que los europeos llevaron consigo (viruela, tifus, fiebre amarilla, etc.) produjo un colapso de la población americana que produjo un gran impacto en la mortandad.<br>  <br>  Los idiomas posteriores que se impusieron obligatoriamente fueron el idioma espa?ol y portugués en sus respectivas zonas de influencia y la religión católica paso a ser oficial; se generó una población con altos niveles de mestizaje genético y cultural entre pueblos originarios, africanos subsaharianos, y los europeos.<br>  <br>  La principal riqueza generada por los territorios espa?oles y colonias portuguesas en América fue la extracción del oro y la plata. ?En los primeros 150 a?os de conquista, 17 mil toneladas de plata y unos 200 toneladas de oro arribaron a Espa?a?.<br>  <br>  Otra importante consecuencia de la llegada de los europeos a América, fue la difusión mundial de los alimentos que habían sido desarrollados por las culturas americanas y que hoy se estima constituyen el 75% de los alimentos consumidos por la Humanidad, entre ellos el maíz, la papa (o patata como se denomina en Espa?a), la batata, la calabaza, el tomate, el chocolate, la vainilla, los ajíes, la palta (o aguacate). Otros productos importantes desarrollados en América son la goma, el tabaco, etc.<br>  <br>  La llegada de Colón a América causó también una gran expansión de la navegación y el comercio entre pueblos que se volvió mundial.<br>  <br>  Los colonos ingleses en América terminaron organizando a partir de 1776 un nuevo tipo de sociedad a partir de conceptos novedosos como independencia, constitución, federalismo y dieron origen a los Estados Unidos que, en el siglo XX, reemplazaría a Gran Breta?a como potencia mundial dominante.<br>  <br>  Un saludo.|`|42145162f534fd4fb8d205cbb0400698aa	Llenar sus arcas de oro,masacrar indigenas e infectar con nuevas enfermedades ,como los indigenas no tenian anticuerpos muerte por espada y muerte por negligencia...|`|CkvT977naa	Que se llenaron de oro, enga?ando a los Indigenas con espejos..que bajeza|`|ZZhr7JaYaa	Enriquecimiento de sus arcas a costo de indigenas, para Espa?a, principal colonizador no trajo principales enriquecimientos, las flotas de corsarios saqueaban los embarques de metales preciosos, una de las obras que en gran mayoria fue patrocinada por America fueron los acabados del palacio de Versalles, las escuadras de mar de Espa?a, Portugal, Francia, Holanda y Breta?a. <br>  La corrupcion y despilfarro de un sistema monarquico no trajo mayores beneficios.|`|sexhmA6Baa	Se llenaron de riquezas, expansion de territorios, fama, y la autoridad plena de exterminar cuanto ser humano se les pusiera delante en oposicion a sus nefastos fines, y a los que no lo hicieron la misma autoridad plena de esclavizarlos.

El "modelo "social" vigente indica rutas a seguir por los televidentes, por los consumidores de prensa manipulada, por ropa, autos u objetos de moda. El sentido de estas acciones para quienes están detrás de todo es obtener poder económico, dinero y disponer a su gusto de países enteros. Todo por egolatría, vanagloria, codicia o avaricia.<br>  No obstante, el "sentido" puede ser más libre en la medida en que tú se lo confieres a aquello que te mueve a estar vivo: luchar por evitar mayor sufrimiento en el mundo, realizar una colección de pinturas al óleo, escribir un libro, realizar una caminata por toda América, ir a convivir con los huicholes, qué sé yo!, todo lo que te sea gratificante.<br>  No hay "sentido" en lo general y colectivo, en efecto, ese es un invento de los "agentes Smith" de la Matrix.<br>  Lo real es lo que ocurre en tu proceso como entidad conciente y vibrante. <br>  Olvídate de los demás.<br>  Un saludo
cfbe97bb6126a63111659f2892cf2e63aa	Creo que si, Un palacio no es cosa de reyes sino es en terminos simples la sede gobierno. La ciudad de México es la sede de gobierno desde el imperio azteca de la triple alianza. Por lo tantos los palacios legislativo H. CU), judicial (SCJN) y ejecutivo (pal. nacional) estan ahi. Ademas d ela sede de muchas otras empresas, dependencia gubernamentales, religiosas y de todo tipo. El palacio es la sede de un poder viene de la colina palatina donde estaba la residencia del emperador en Roma.

Desde luego la cd. de México tiene obras arquitectónicas envidiables, pero hay otras ciudades en Asia y Europa que le quitarían el aliento. Yo no sólo no creo que aún es válido, sino que nunca lo fue. No por no tener palacios, sino por no ser digna de ser LA ciudad de los palacios.<br>  <br>  Y eso de "muy leal" supongo que viene de la época en que las colonias espa?olas en América debían permanecer fieles a Espa?a.

Some wish to be everything but the current circumstances and some are actually in touch with reality as to understand and adapt to its unpredictability..

dQXu6DCSaa	I pretty much agree with Stephenie Meyer's dream cast. Especially Rachel Leigh Cook for Alice. She's perfect.<br>  On the other hand, I have no idea who should play Edward.|`|245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	I'm not sure about the other characters, but I would absolutely LOVE it if Daniel Panabaker played the part of Bella. She looks perfect for the part, I think.<br>  <br>  And it is NOT official, that there is going to be a movie. They're trying to make it happen, but it is NOT official at all. It might not even happen at all. This is in response to the first person who answered.|`|DFJGwDljaa	I know this is a popular sujestion for Bella but i think Emily Browning would be great as Bella. For Jacob i think that Steven Strait would do and awesome job playing that role. For Alice I think that Rachel Leigh Cook looks like her. For Carlisle, Charlie Hunnam would be really good. For James, Cillian Murphy. For Charlie i'm not sure he is a pretty easy role to choose any old guy could play him lol. I don't think there is anyone out there who can play Edward he's just to perfect. Although Stephenie Meyer said that no one over 21 is allowed to play Edward. On Stephenie Meyer's website she has her dream Twilight cast on there if you want to check it out <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_movie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_m...</a>|`|0v6sJmPSaa	Idk, but I can't believe there's gonna be a movie!

Well, me and my friends. =P<br>  Edward- Henry Cavill. He's just stuck in my mind as Edward!<br>  Jacob- Steven Strait. I loved him in The Covenant!<br>  Carlisle- Charlie Hunnam. I have him pictured as Carlisle.<br>  Alice- Rachel Leigh Cook. I think she can work short, pixie-ish hair.<br>  Rosalie- I'm not sure. I can't really think of anybody, so I'll go along with Joanna Kruppa.<br>  Emmett- TOM WELLING! <3 I LOVE Smallville, and I think Tom Welling would be perfect for the role.<br>  Esme- Kate Beckinsale. She's gorgeous.<br>  Jasper- I have no idea who should play Jasper... I haven't seen anyone that just screams "Jasper". I'll have to keep looking. =)|`|Q0WqmbhVaa	I agree with the most of Meyer's list. As for Bella, I'd choose Emily Browning because her profile matches the most with Meyer's description of our heroine ("heartshaped face"; this was from the Midnight Sun chapter on her website). But I would be fine with Danielle Panabaker too, because she's so talented. There is a lot of young talent these days, so who knows!

AA10394685	Oh, Ward Stradlater all the way. Ackley could whistle, but Stradlater was a 'secret slob', which I can relate to, and who was surely much more fun (even though a pain). I had both a Stradlater and an Ackley as roommates in prep school. I like the presumed reference to George HW Bush (former President, Phillips Andover Academy, Class of 1942) who is seen with Sally Hayes: "She was with some Joe-Yale-looking type...His name was George something, and he went Andover. Big deal." This book was written in the 40's and there is much speculation that JD Salinger actually met George HW Bush during school break in NYC in the mid 1940's, when Bush was at Yale (after Andover).<br>  <br>  Although I also got a kick out of "Commander Blop". Pretty hilarious.|`|ese1gBZuaa	Ackley.  Stradlater is more tolerable a human being in the book, because he understands social cues.  While Ackley must look and act gross, at least he isn't fake and part of the "crowd."  Stradlater goes out with Jane, doesn't say what he does, and punches Holden, he's more of a backstabber that the "what you see is what you get" Ackley.|`|3oEFsp2Xaa	Im not a fan of either really.

Pero en Adán, era preciso tomar partido por una de las dos posturas. Unos le atribuyeron ombligo, y otros no. Miguel Angel, como para compensar la taca?ería de otros, le otorgó ombligo a Adán, y como pintaba para la capilla privada del Papa (la Capilla Sixtina) y estaba en estrecho contacto con el pontífice entonces reinante, se podría pensar que esto había zanjado la cuestión. Pero como veremos no fue así, porque en 1646, el doctor sir Thomas Browne se encuentra envuelto en la controversia del lado "antiombliguísta". La atribución a Adán, dice, de "esa tortuosidad o complicada nudosidad que usualmente llamamos ombligo" es un error espantoso, no obstante "los auténticos dibujos de Angelo y otros", de los que se infiere que "el Creador afectó superfluidades o partes ordenadas sin uso ni oficio". Algunos sabios, sin embargo, sostuvieron que Dios podía haberles puesto ombligos a Adán y a Eva, con el solo fin de poner a prueba la fe de hombres posteriores que dudaran de ello, eso es, para ver si preferían ser razonables o devotos. En la Biblia no se menciona ni una vez si Adán y Eva tenían ombligo. El pensamiento que quedó en pie fue, que sí tenían ombligo. Pero la cuestión no quedo olvidada, y volvió a salir a la luz nada menos que en 1944. ?Dónde?, en donde iba a ser, en EE.UU. El Congreso de Estados Unidos revivió al ombligo milenario cuando una subcomisión de la Comisión de Asuntos Militares de la Cámara de Representantes, presidida por el representante Durham, de Carolina del Norte, se opuso a la distribución de "Las razas de la humanidad" a los soldados, sosteniendo (entre otras cosas) que en una de sus ilustraciones, "Adán y Eva estaban representados con ombligos". El problema era una cuestión de racismo, que se convirtió en un problema de religión, y en un ejemplo de tontería yanqui.|`|4f9f4e5f4180b8888b19b193d34538acaa	Adan y Eva son personajes simbolicos y/o mitologicos, como lo quieras ver.

Jadis attachés à la cour des souverains, les griots devaient retenir et transmettre scrupuleusement leur généalogie, source de leur légitimité (? Ma parole est pure et dépouillée de tout mensonge, c’est la parole de mon père, […] les griots du roi ignorent le mensonge ?). Publié au moment de l’indépendance, Soundiata a eu un retentissement considérable car un ensemble territorial éphémère regroupant l’ancien Soudan fran?ais et le Sénégal venait de voir le jour sous le nom de fédération du Mali (1959-1960).<br>  <br>  En recueillant les paroles du célèbre griot, Djibril Tamsir Niane n’a pas seulement fait ?uvre d’historien ; il a aussi perpétré la tradition et fixé à tout jamais un récit sur le point d’être altéré par la perte de crédibilité des griots sous l’influence des médias modernes. Soundiata est plus qu’un récit historique ; à travers cet ouvrage, rédigé par un auteur qui sait, comme les griots, que ? tout nom à un sens et une signification secrète ?, passe le souffle des grandes épopées transmises par des générations ininterrompues d’? historiens de la parole ?, sachant raviver l’intérêt du public par une anecdote sans jamais altérer le contenu du récit.

OK, so let's start analyzing your evaluation.<br>  <br>  Ideas--Um, first of all not one book in the history of writing (except the first one ever written) does not have ideas from previously written books.  If an idea is good, it will be used time and time again, though it will be transformed and evolved to fit each author's individual style.  And no matter what names she has taken, she definitely didn't take "Harry Potter" from another story.  If you haven't heard about how the idea came into her head, you should find it.  She was sitting on a late train without pen and paper, and a skinny black haired kid with glasses popped into her head.  She thought about the name, and, wanting to use something simple, she chose Harry.  Potter just seemed to fit.  And Rowling's idea of a Horcrux is changed from the "original story" you speak of.  If this is true, Horcruxes refer to splitting the soul into 7.  In Rowling's story, a Horcrux is an object in which a torn portion of soul is concealed.  And besides, Voldemort's soul was split into 8, not 7.  And just out of curiosity, was the name "Horcrux" ever used in that story?  And did it say how the soul was split?  By the evil act of murder?  My score: 24/25<br>  <br>  I agree with you on the English--all good.  My score: 20/20<br>  <br>  The plot of each book is absolutely fantastic.  How else do you think she could keep people entranced and on their toes for 10 years?  And as for having things mixed up, (let me just add something here before I go on: I don't know exactly what you're talking about...everything seemed pretty straightforward throughout the entire DH to me) JKR has openly admitted that she has made classrooms jump floors from year to year and Montague was at school for 8 years instead of 7.  Did you really expect her to be able to keep absolutely everything she has said in 3000 pages straight?  I didn't and I wouldn't expect it of anyone.  If someone could do that they should earn some type of award.  But her main plot essentials have been constant.  Harry's eyes have always been Lily's, those subtle hints about Snape's true nature have always been constant and correct, even through chapters like "Spinner's End" and "The Dark Lord Ascending" and "The Lighting Struck Tower".  I'll give you to some extent random, but she ALWAYS explains her reasoning and it turns out that such events were not random.  Take the sword ending up near Harry and Hermione in the Forest of Dean.  That seems so bogus and cheesy when we first see it, but in "The Prince's Tale" it becomes clear why the sword was there.  And the Epilogue--what did you expect, another book?  She had 10 pages to describe their lives after Hogwarts and Voldemort.  She captured the most important aspects:  Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione.  She showed how Teddy Lupin turned out all right even though both his parents died--a very powerful message.  She even includes Draco and his feelings toward Harry--exactly what they should be.  And she shows that Harry's scar is no longer important and that his love has conquered all.  Oh, but I'll give you that his kids' names are a tiny bit cheesy.  Seems pretty inconsequential compared to the big messages she's hitting on in the epilogue.  My score: 25/25<br>  <br>  Style--Wow.  Did you read the books?  I already explained my take on her randomness, so I won't say any more here.  Her take on relationships is quite good, actually.  She shows Ron's immaturity and how that plays into Hermione's feelings about him throughout GoF, OotP, and HBP.  We can see that relationship developing and turning into what it is going to be just like we would in real life.  She did not write this as a fairy tale love story with scenarios that could never happen.  Two best friends who know deep down that they care for each other, one of them very immature, the other more mature than her age, and they finally come together, not at a sunny, happy celebration where they just kind of see each other and say, well, let's go!  They come together and close over the death of a mentor and friend.  Finally they realize that they need each other.  Ginny and Harry is probably more developed and real life that Ron/Hermione.  Ginny acts just like any young girl with a crush and Harry acts like a typical boy throughout the entire series: he sees the superficial relationships without realizing what he wants.  Ginny almost forgets Harry too.  Finally they realize what they want.  It's very developed, very complex, and very realistic.  My score: 24/25<br>  <br>  Overview:  My score: 5/5<br>  <br>  Therefore my overall score of JKR is 98/100<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you wanted to explain yourself more, you could have submitted the max characters and then added additional details.<br>  <br>  Thank you, Willy.  I'll take that as a compliment. :-)|`|S749Bbp9aa	thats good i agree with most of it but all in all i think shes just a little bit better then u make her out to be....the 19 years later thing is kind of a joke...i can see Ron and Hermine together but not harry and Ginny...they only kissed twice and it didn't look to me like that was going anywhere ...there are lots of stories about wizards and magic out there she just got lucky with hers...id probably give her an 80/100   she was pretty good with keeping you in suspense .....i thought  every book was confusing at the beginning... i think u need to read them beck to back to back to get the full feeling of her story|`|cdtnsvYLaa	Personally, I thought her books were very good. She tied together 7 books very well together, but each book could stand on its own without having to read another to make sense of it. I thought it was very good that she took ideas from other places that one might be familiar with as it made it much easier to make the story believable.<br>  I thought it was also well done the way she told the story because the plot was not predictable. It was also cool because it was written in such a way that everyone was trying to guess the clues, which were there, but not glaringly obvious. All in all, I think she did a remarkable job as she managed to write 7 books in a row which all were bestsellers. That was a remarkable feat. How many authors out there can boast that they can do that? I say, all in all, well done.|`|hlLGMsRCaa	i'd say meh

xIMO0JAyaa	beh...la passione e l innamoramento nascono dalla momentanea volonta d sospendere il giudizio, anche a costo di chiudere gli occhi. cio che sorprende è quanto si possa idealizzare un altro mentre si hanno problemi anche ad accettare se stessi...E' sempe di sconosciuti che ci innamoriamo, è sempre con sconosciuti che nasce la vera passione. La pulsione iniziale parte necessariamente dalla non conoscenza... <br>  Nell amare qualcuno, il bene e il male, con l andar del tempo girano. Ci si puo illudere della stabilita della passione e delle emozioni umane; operando una divisione netta tra amore e non-amore...La verita è che dentro di noi nascondiamo una quantita di inconfessate, contrastanti emozioni, stratificazioni di comportamenti infantili, su cui abbiamo scarso o nullo controllo. Collere, impulsi cannibaleschi,fantasie distruttive, bisessualita e paronia infantile si intrecciano tutte a piu rispettabili pulsioni. La nostra vita è quindi scandita dalle vertiginose 'rivoluzioni dell orologio', per cui il 'cosa vuole' cambia cosi rapidamnte che il 'chi è' viene posto costantemente in discussione. Nonostante in contrapposizione alle discontinuita cè sempre una naturale esigenza omeostatica(il mantenimento della sabilita nel contesto emozionale)-e non voletemene ma io sono convinta che il matrimonio sia uno dei tanti tentativi di costringere il cuore all amore eterno- la tragedia dell amore e della passione amorosa è che non sfugge alle dimensioni temporali.  basta pensare all'orribile ma cosi vera idea secondo cui la persona per cui oggi sacrificheresti tutto, tra pochi mesi potrebbe indurti, pur di evitarla, ad attraversare la strada.|`|B69ZcagZaa	Ciao,<br>  Il rispetto, la dolcezza e l'attrazione fisica e mantale.|`|TWYnmHgXaa	La passione va vissuta fino in fondo, forse è proprio il destino che te la propone.<br>  Si può tenerla viva con l' aggiunta dell'amore.<br>  Va vissuta fino a che non ti accorgi che può danneggiarti.|`|6jYqaiZAaa	se s intende la passione amorosa, beh sono gli ormoni! e va vissuta|`|dZeXWZGeaa	Siamo noi i responsabili della passione e la dobbiamo vivere fino a spremerla del tutto per poi renderla infinita.<br>  <br>  Essa è indispensabile per una vita consapevole, il controllo di essa vien da sé se ci si convive bene.|`|kjZOaooyaa	la passione può essere una componente dell'amore ,ma puo  anche esistere senza amore ,pensando che lo sia.,Credo sia un'alchimia ,qualcosa di chimico,come una corrente elettrica ,che ti fa sentire vivo , ti eccita. ti dà una grande energia,e nasce dalla libido,cioè energia sessuale.Credo che vada vissuta sia per esaurirla e procedere oltre,coè nel trasformarla in amore oppure  esaurirla e chiudere.,è cmq un'esperienza unica.Altro invece è vivere con passione la vita,cioè il proprio lavoro,le attività ,gli interessi e la conoscenza in generale,la religione ,la ricerca interiore,la passione ti fa vivere sempre con grande entusiasmo tutto ,ti fa buttare a capofitto in ciò che fai con perenne entusiasmo,è qualcosa di innato,di spontaneo,di genetico.,e può morire se  ti  delude ,cioè perde interesse la cosa in cui credevi ciecamente.|`|NaqmsIkCaa	LA passione, a mio avviso, và sempre vissuta perchè spesso è un attimo che non torna...<br>  tenerla viva non è facile...non devi cadere nella routine , devi cercare di non inquadrarla e viverla in modo sempre diverso...
DcCSIAGzaa	One suggestion: seeing the plays performed, in a (true-to-the-play) movie adaptation or in a theater, or listening to them on tape and reading along will most likely be more rewarding.  Plays were meant to be acted out, not read.  So with my suggestions, I'll point out a good movie version if there is one.<br>  <br>  Twelfth Night is great, possibly my favorite movie Shakespeare.  There's a movie with Helena Bonham Carter that is excellent.<br>  Macbeth is excellent, my favorite play, very complex.  I don't think you'll really have too much with the language in any of these plays, though.  There are weird phrases and archaic words, but usually you can guess pretty easily, and most books have annotations anyway.<br>  Hamlet is also very complex and a very good play, lots of psychology going on there, and some nice soliloquoys.  Kenneth Branagh did a great, complete version of Hamlet.  Stay away from the Mel Gibson version.<br>  Midsummer Night's Dream is a really fun play, and there's the movie with Stanley Tucci as Puck.  <br>  Much Ado about Nothing I have only seen in movie version, but it is laugh-out-loud funny, Emma Thompson stars in the movie.  It's a light comedy, but with some excellent displays of wit and foolishness, and an interesting look at their social norms.<br>  Romeo and Juliet is a less complex but very popular play.  It has some great language, but I tend to like it less than the story around it.<br>  Merchant in Venice-this is okay, but I liked it less than most of the others.<br>  Othello-I actually think this is kind of a bad play except for the character Iago who is the evil one.  Race issues go back, though.<br>  The Tempest is quite nice, but not necessarily an introductory play.  I would start with something else.<br>  <br>  Once you become a fan of the Bard, you can enjoy The Complete Works of William Shakespeare (Abridged) and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.  The first and parts of the movie version of the second are on YouTube, naturally.<br>  <br>  On a side note, you should look into Muse magazine, with a "fan site" at www.musefanpage.com  There's a great community of precocious and startlingly inventive kids and teens there, who were my kind of people back then, and I suspect may be your kind of people.|`|D0QlsYAOaa	I'm in 12th grade. I've read four plays and seen one additional one. I think it might be hard to understand Shakespeare without some kind of plot-synopsis along with it (language makes it harder to follow the relatively simple plots), but it's great that you want to try! I love Shakespeare.<br>  <br>  There are three categories: histories, tragedies, and comedies. <br>  <br>  I don't know about the histories, but I love the comedies. My favorite all-time is A Midsummer Night's Dream. I would also recommend Twelfth Night or What You Will. Romeo and Juliet is good too and probably one of the better-known plays. It also has elements of comedy, particularly if you have one of the texts that have annotations on the opposite page explaining words, phrases, and allusions. <br>  <br>  Twelfth Night is hilarious though. In Shakespeare's time, there would have been an actor pretending to be a girl who was pretending to be a boy.<br>  <br>  The play I saw was As You Like It. Great actors, great play. I don't know how easy it is to read, but I followed pretty well watching it, although ESL students had a harder time.|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	1.) Well, you're going to probably read Romeo & Juliet in high school, so you could read it now to "get it over with"...none of Shakespeare plays are really "easy". The language is difficult, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. I can't say that you could understand it because I don't know you personally, but I definitely think you should try - I know people who started reading Shakespeare in sixth or seventh grade.<br>  2.) As You Like It was my favorite - you should read that one, if Romeo and Juliet doesn't work for you.|`|iF5CS457aa	No they will not be easy, you will understand it for the most part, but miss a great deal no matter which play you choose.<br>  <br>  No Fear shakespeare helps tho, makes it very easy.<br>  <br>  Romeo and Juliet is the easiest, and/or midsummers night dream... both of which are a bit cheesy romantic... MSND has alot of humor in it though you might find funny. <br>  <br>  My favorite is Macbeth.|`|bC0X25u7aa	1. I'd recommend reading The Winter's Tale or The Taming of the Shrew. They might be easier - although I wouldn't really call anything by Shakespeare "easy" - than the tragedies. You could give Macbeth a try as well. <br>  2. My favorite Shakespearean play has to be either Othello or The Merchant Of Venice. I can never pick between those two. |`|erwO9hnjaa	Much Ado About Nothing<br>  <br>  I had to read Romeo and Juliet twice before appreciating it. The first time I kept criticizing it. ("This is stupid!" "Why are they such dumb people?") I was so mature freshman year.<br>  <br>  The Folger Theatre prints versions of Shakespeare plays with definitions and explantion on each page, if you're looking for some help understanding him. (I use them. They're wonderful.)|`|XJWeuLPoaa	with shakespeare there isnt any easy ones.. lol ive read 12night & much ado about nothing they were both good loved them<br>  but 12night was my favorite! :) |`|TE7foNwMaa	Hey Eva!<br>  I've (at least attempted) to read a few Shakespeare plays in the past... The easiest one, was definitely Romeo and Juliet, but they are really hard to follow... We had to act out a play on that one, too... haha, I was the friar, but he's not supposed to be a girl... it was pretty awkward. <br>  <br>  As to my favorite, I'd have to stick with Romeo and Juliet. It's a classic. Macbeth was pretty good, too... but I think it's even harder to understand. My sister's reading that one right now, and my brother had to actually BE Shakespeare in his english class. <br>  <br>  I actually don't think these books are too fun to read while you're reading them, but once you've finished and gotten through most of it, they're cool to think about...and try to decipher... :P But good luck with the reading. I also recommend "The Miracle Worker"... I'm not exactly sure who it's by, but it's one of the books about Helen Keller... it's in screenplay format, but it was really (surprisingly) good. "Deathwatch" was even better... we had to read a ton of books in my english class last year...and this year, but this year's books are insanely boring (like The Old Man and the Sea.... Oh my gosh, it took him 94 pages before he finally caught a fish that he had been trying to catch throughout the WHOLE book!!!)<br>  <br>  Heh, well good luck, hope you find the right play / book! Sorry, I ramble like crazy. ;)|`|VlEftzx7aa	My favorite when I was your age was A Midsummer's Nights Dream. It's filled with fairies, unrequited love and the consequences of naughty pranks.|`|d59940d88cb243925d59f301eb2f8710aa	Romeo and Juliet. I still don't get it, but I like it.<br>  Is Intense and passionate, and a bit crazy./|`|kCb09PAWaa	read Romeo and Juliet i read it in 9th grade. It is the only one i've read so  far but it was pretty good.|`|a6Sg9ghVaa	I'm in 8th grade two and I have the same thing I though that the Romeo and Juliet was a good play |`|I6hJYj2maa	 I like the twelfth night, and I'm in 8th grade.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	I wanted to try Shakespeare when I was younger, and my dad told me to read A Midsummer Night's Dream. It was good, but it was a lot better after I'd taken classes in literary analysis and experienced a bit more life. There's a LOT of innuendo in Midsummer, so if you're good with catching double meanings, feel free to give it a go - it's really funny. I would advise getting a book that has footnotes explaining unfamiliar words - if you have No Fear Shakespeare, you'll use the plain English as a crutch. The language isn't that hard once you get used to it.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for something simple, I would say Romeo and Juliet has the most straightforward plot that I've read. (And there are several movie versions you can watch after you finish to make sure you understood.)|`|lsKEbeacaa	Hamlet is really cool; there's even a great film adaptation called "Hamlet" starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close that you can watch afterwords. |`|YdoH6cKmaa	Hi Eva.  While my favorite Shakespearean play is Macbeth, I wouldn't advise anyone to read that one first unless you like weird, dangerous, violent, and scary things.  For a first Shakespearean read I would suggest Romeo and Juliet--which is also tragic, but not as warped as Macbeth.  If you prefer comedy I suggest As You Like It and/or Midsummer Night's Dream.  Hamlet?  Hamlet's a pretty intense Shakespearean play.  Of course you mention you are advanced for your age, and that may be no problem for you. The problem, however, that I sense for an advanced thirteen year old young lady is Shakespeare's Early Modern English.  It's easier to understand that the old forms, but it is not we are used to these days.  Perhaps, a guide with translations would you help you grasp his English so that you can enjoy the plays.  You can also buy (rent?) the movies in their original Shakespearean English which I find helps me and my students appreciate and more deeply comprehend what Shakespeare's plays are all about.  I wish you much adventure, fun, and insight as you embark on your bold and very commendable journey.  Truly "Specialist"|`|nwi9Fv9Baa	1. Romeo and Juliet is a really good play.  The "Henry" series was enjoyable too (from what I remember of it.)(Note: You may need to know a bit of history to read this series, or another other "biography" of a king.)  MacBeth is interesting, but kinda dark.  <br>  <br>  2. Mine favorite has always been Hamlet.<br>  <br>  I took a Shakespearean Play class in college, in which we had to read a series of plays.  I found it easiest to play the audio track of the play while reading it.  (There was a collection of Shakespearean plays on albums at LSU, where I went to college.)|`|J5ZfC1ILaa	hey <br>  <br>  i read romeo and juliet which was good but only if you like that sort of thing. but my friend read much ado about nothing which is a comedy which she said was good. <br>  <br>  i wouldnt reccomend macbeth though it was very long-winded and the change in characters from the beginning to the end of the play was very extreme. but give it a try it did have some ok points. but mainly i would go for much ado about nothing.|`|9CN0ZvAVaa	Well i'd say start with Romeo and Juliet since you will read it when you get to ninth. Romeo and Juliet was the easiest one for me. But my persnal favourite is Hamlet and Macbeth is right next to it.
JpfBoRggaa	Yes. As we are right now, our "consciousness", our sense of self, is of  a physical body, with a cellular structure. With difficult psychological work on oneself, one may be able to create a second body, called a "soul" by various religions, that can live much, much longer than the physical body. We are not given a soul when we are born, it must be created BY THE PERSON who is to have one. The soul has a molecular nature, rather than cellular. It can go anywhere air can go, including, obviously, inside other bodies, since all animal life forms breathe. Thus, we could live other peoples lives by entering into their physical body. <br>  <br>  With continued work on oneself, one might eventually develop a body with an electronic structure to it, called a "spirit" by various religions. An electronic body is essentially a body of light. Since light actually IS indestructable, omnipresent and eternal, so would a persons spirit. Of course, this means ones sense of self is a part of that body. [A cellular body is basically a body of water. A soul is basically a body of air ("I come like water and like the wind I go" Omar Khayyam). They have different venues. A body of light can leave the galaxy. <br>  <br>  We can know, to a certain extent, what type of work we need to do to grow a soul. But the creation of a spirit is much more subtle and little is known. The  ideas are so outside of our experience that they appear magical or religious to ordinary thinking.|`|9XysmLqHaa	Well it depends what your standards of immortal are.  If you're talking about never dying, as in living forever in the same body you have now, I would say that's impossible.<br>  <br>  But if you're talking about living forever, as in your soul living forever, but not your body, then I would say that it's very possible.  Most religions have their beliefs on what it takes to be immortal in that sense.  They also have many different views on what immortality means.<br>  <br>  I personally am highly convinced that this world is not the only thing there is, and physically dying does not mean mortality.|`|SccdOuO6aa	Hmmm. Immortal would suggest eternal life and immunity to all causes of death. I guess it is 'possible'..but I think it would be better to ask is it possible to keep people dying from old age, which in the future will most likely occur. As soon as they can make a passable heart, etc then I think this will happen. People will slowly transform into a kind of robot. Maybe even in our lifetime. Just think about how long the internet has been around. How much smarter will the next generation be? What kind of technology will be thrust into the world? What kind of illnesses will be cured? I definately think it is possible, but in my personal opinion, undesirable.<br>  <br>  Then of course there is the religious approach. Many religions can offer you some immortality. Christianity, Islam, etc..the list is quite infinite. You could even create your own religion that offers you immortality =D!|`|gy4hYyK2aa	Our souls are immortal, but our bodies are not.<br>  But I guess your question was really referring to whether or not our bodies can become immortal or not. I'm not sure if that's really possible, but I saw this movie once (Bicentennial Man) where, if a part of someones body wasn't working anymore, they would just implant an artificial part that their bodies didn't reject (don't know how they did that). For example, if someone had heart problems, they would simply take that heart out and put an artificial heart in. I'm not sure if that would work, and I'm sure it would prolong life. But there comes a point in life, that people know it's their time to die, and stop accepting medical care, because they don't want to live forever, they want to go ahead and die, and go on to the next journey.|`|zPBIxjPOaa	its possible but i don't think it would be right for any number of people to be immortal but the idea of being immortal is a perverse topic.<br>   <br>  Because nothing lasts forever even gods and time will end but after that the end of every thing cant stay the same perhaps the only thing that continues to exist no mater what is that changing will always occur because obviously i just said nothing is forever that is a paradox we will find out eventually.<br>  <br>   Any ways if "immortality" were achievable by humans i would not allow that person to continue to exist i would kill them or imprison them till they die its not right for humans to have that because we would abuse it i would like to say we did but its some thing humans cant ever have or shouldn't have because obviously our existence as mortals cant be forever i hope we will not be human when that day comes|`|JiDxYq2gaa	I don't think you can become immortal but it's an interesting concept to think about. I mean what would you do if you could live forever? I think you would feel pretty alone after a while. Even if you got close to people they would eventually die and you wouldn't..I honestly don't know but if you find anything interesting out let me know. C:|`|7dCWbvKIaa	I think it's completely impossible to become immortal in our bodies, due to the fact that they cannot survive that long no matter what. Unless we were in outer space and didn't need oxygen there is no way. Oxygen is what makes us live and it's also what breaks us down and kills us, so even if there was a way our bodies would eventually fall apart. Unless someone finds out how to preserve them.|`|z0K8pgZiaa	no, we cant jump high or do any 'super' stuff.<br>  |`|8OjEcDyBaa	Nobody has ever done it. At the moment, the idea is considered to be within the realm of fantasy. <br>  <br>  Some scientists are beginning to study the processes in the body that cause us to age, but nothing is in the works as far as a means to stop it, and even ending the bodies ability to age (which is a ridiculous prospect in and of itself) would not necessarily mean immortality. There's nothing to say that your body would not continue to wear down, despite not aging, You could still die in all the ways anybody else dies, such as injury, disease, or hear attack, or just plain living so long that your body stops working. <br>  <br>  For all we know, that natural process of aging is what allows such long life. <br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  -Fox|`|UkxBPVJNaa	i guess it depends on what religion u are. some religions believe that after you die u become immortal. i dont no much about other religions. personally, i am catholic. and as a catholic, i believe that after death, our human souls either go to heaven or hell. <br>  <br>  the dictionary definition for immortal is "living forever, never dying or decaying". i believe that after our initial human death, we do live forever; either in eternal damnation, or eternal paradise. <br>  <br>  so, to answer ur question, YES!!!! good luck finding the right answer. lol :) :) :)|`|puw8Ff6Iaa	   If by immortal you mean incapable of dying, then no. Plants and animals live on for millions of years through reproduction. People live on in history through their words and deeds. Live forever?

So in each life, we gain new experiences and in turn the soul grows wiser and stronger. I believe since the world is forever changing, we will continue to reincarnate.<br>  <br>  I have often wondered about immortality. I believe it to be possible through perhaps a freak accident in a medical breakthrough, and why i say accident is cos surely it would be a marvelous discovery however a disaster all the same to the human race. <br>  <br>  I also believe that in the past Gods were just immortal beings, living forever until something killed them. but this is just a belief and a theory, whether they actually existed or not is entirely up to ones belief.|`|Hhxs0mRxaa	No, but some scientists are working on it. They came up with this thing where, right before you die, they freeze your body up, and contain you in this big silver cylinder. It stays exactly the same for a really long time (like a couple of hundred years). When they find a cure your whatever you were dying of, they take you back out, unfreeze you, and cure you before you actually die. It costs like a million dollars to do it though. (There are only like fifteen people in the whole world who are actually signed up for this experiment.) They're not even close to beings sure if it works or not, and I'm not sure what it's called. I just saw a show about it on the Discover Channel, or maybe it was the History Channel. (I'm not sure.) Oh, well, hope this helps.|`|wUDxd5eDaa	I'd very much be interested to find this out myself. I'm assuming (sorry I have no proven facts) that if there was a possibility it would have been put to use. Or (another assumption) like some discoveries with cloning, making people immortal could be too dangerous to expose if it has already been discovered.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	"For God so loved the world, He gave His only begotten son, that whoever believes in Him shall never perish but have eternal life." --John 3:16<br>  <br>  Physically speaking, no, there is no way to get our bodies to live forever. We have found that by studying science. We have also found by studying science that there is a God and that the Bible is accurate.
M2UWOTAjaa	On a very mundane level, art can be sold, and the proceeds given to charity. That's direct. Indirectly, interior decorating, a minor art, is very important in places like hospitals, where people feel much more comfortable in rooms and corridors that are as homelike as possible. This reduces anxiety in some patients, especially children.<br>  Some art is of great historical interest. The cave art of Les Trois Scorciers has universal importance, as it shows us magical ritual in practice. Art from the ancient world tells us a great deal about the people of the time; antique Greek vases are particularly beautiful. Sometimes the achievements of artists is awesome. The Sistine <br>  Chapel rightly holds honors as one of the greatest works of art in the world. The Aztec sculptors who carved jade (a very hard mineral) with whatever tools they had (they certainly had no steel or iron tools) also deserve our respect. Unicorn and fairy wallpaper can make a child feel happy in her bedroom.<br>  As for music, music is truly universal. You don't need to know anything about India in order to appreciate the music, all you need to to is to listen to it with an  open mind.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Yes, we need to eat. Sleep. Breathe. We need shelter. But a person who lives on these things alone is a person who goes insane. If all there was was stocks, business, mail, news, war, how would we get by? Besides Jesus and free will, I think art is God's best gift to man.<br>  <br>  What is art? Art, most simply, is communication. Everyone has something to say. As humans we have a basic need to share these things with one another, through music, writing, visual arts, and so much more.<br>  <br>  Art touches the soul. We work and eat and sleep and breathe so we can keep on living, but if we had no art, why would we live? (short of religion)<br>

J'aurais voulu te répondre en poésie, mais tous ce que je peux dire c'est une réponse scientifique.  <br>  Il y a longtemps qu'il y a une guerre entre le c?ur et l'esprit.  On croyait même avant peu, une couple de centaines d'année, que l'ame se situait dans le c?ur.  Que le c?ur était la source de nos émotions, de notre volonté, de notre raison. Cela d? probablement au fluide qui est pompé et réparti dans tout le corps et qui donne vie. Plus tard, la majorité des attributs que l'on donnait au c?ur ont été transférés au cerveau: les émotions, la raison, la mémoire.  Toutefois, la guerre du c?ur (émotion) et de l'esprit (raison) se passe en fait qu'à un seul endroit, le cerveau.  Nous jouons entre nos attributs ancestral très instinctifs, l'émotion , et celui acquis par notre évolution en homme moderne, la  raison.  Les deux sont en partie innés et acquis lors d'expérience de la vie, géré par les hormones et neurotransmetteurs. <br>  La vie serait plus simple sans ce complexe cérébral qui nous a permis de construire, d'analyser et de comprendre. Oui, Hélas! Comprendre,  cela dépends tellement du point de vu que du sujets. Des paramètres que l'on croit être vrai.  De l'intérêt que l'on a dans une situation et du sentiment de conservation.  La guerre  est devenu une science complexe et plus sauvage et cruelle qu'elle ne l'aurait été  si nous serions resté à un stade beaucoup moins avancé de notre évolution. Je suis une scientifique et je suis porté à croire que si l'humain existe telle qu'il est, c'est qu'il a sa place.  La diversité des organismes sur la terre est due entre autres par la multiplication des milieux de vie et des sources d'alimentation.  L'humain existe car il semble être le seul  capable d'utiliser les éléments autour de lui pour construire.  Par la suite, il semble être le seul à être capable de faire des raisonnements profonds, existentiels et d'analyse de haut niveau.

It tells an unhappy tale about three unlucky children. Even though they are charming and clever, the Baudelaire siblings lead lives filled with misery and woe. From the very first page of this book when the children are at the beach and receive terrible news, continuing on through the entire story, disaster lurks at their heels. One might say they are magnets for misfortune<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead<br>  <br>  Discription: Vampire Academy (first book)<br>  Lissa Dragomir is a Moroi princess: a mortal vampire with an unbreakable bond to the earth's magic. She must be protected at all times from Strigoi; the fiercest and most dangerous vampires--the ones who never die.<br>  <br>  The powerful blend of human and vampire blood that flows through Rose Hathaway, Lissa's best friend, makes her a Dhampir; she is dedicated to a dangerous life of protecting Lissa from the Strigoi, who are hell-bent on making her one of them.<br>  <br>  After two years of illicit freedom, Rose and Lissa are caught and dragged back to St. Vladimir's Academy, hidden in the deep forests of Montana. Rose will continue her Dhampir education. Lissa will go back to being Queen of the elite Moroi social scene. And both girls will resume breaking hearts.<br>  <br>  Fear made Lissa and Rose run away from St. Vladimir's--but their world is fraught with danger both inside and out of the Academy's iron gates. Here, the cutthroat ranks of the Moroi perform unspeakable rituals and their secretive nature and love of the night creates an enigmatic world full of social complexities. Rose and Lissa must navigate through<br>  <br>  this dangerous world, confront the temptation of forbidden romance, and never once let their guard down, lest the Strigoi make Lissa one of them forever...<br>  <br>  <br>  The Host By Stephenie Meyer<br>  <br>  Discription:<br>  Melanie Stryder refuses to fade away.<br>  <br>  Our world has been invaded by an unseen enemy. Humans become hosts for these invaders, their minds taken over while their bodies remain intact and continue their lives apparently unchanged. Most of humanity has succumbed.<br>  <br>  When Melanie, one of the few remaining "wild" humans is captured, she is certain it is her end. Wanderer, the invading "soul" who has been given Melanie's body, was warned about the challenges of living inside a human: the overwhelming emotions, the glut of senses, the too vivid memories. But there was one difficulty Wanderer didn't expect: the former tenant of her body refusing to relinquish possession of her mind.<br>  <br>  Wanderer probes Melanie's thoughts, hoping to discover the whereabouts of the remaining human resistance. Instead, Melanie fills Wanderer's mind with visions of the man Melanie loves—Jared, a human who still lives in hiding. Unable to separate herself from her body's desires, Wanderer begins to yearn for a man she has been tasked with exposing. When outside forces make Wanderer and Melanie unwilling allies, they set off on a dangerous and uncertain search for the man they both love.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Janna Mystories: by Felocoty Pulman<br>  Rosemary for Remembrance (first book)<br>  Janna lives at the edge of a forest in medieval England. Her whole world turns upside down following the death of her mother. Accident? Janna doesn't think so, but the dark and powerful forces ranged against her will stop at nothing to prevent her from finding out the truth.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Last Vampire: Christopher Pike<br>  The Last Vampire (first book)<br>  A bind-up edition of two vampire stories.

CjPtAEzmaa	First, talk to your teacher about it. Make sure you are polite. Say something like, "I really enjoy playing piano, but I haven't been enjoying it as much lately because I don't enjoy the songs I'm learning. I feel like you won't let me play songs that I do like." If she still won't budge, I would definitely consider getting a new teacher. Who is she to tell you what songs to play? You're not taking piano FOR her, you're taking piano FROM her. Find a teacher who suits your taste and has a teaching style that fits you better.|`|nBaHzNbRaa	i sympathsises with you...well i play the violin and had a teacher that picked everything she wanted me to play, which i hated because i didnt like the songs she picked for me. i really like her, but i hated practicing for the same reason as you. and my teacher would get mad at me cause she could tell i wasnt practicing, and my mom was mad because of the wasted money. i ended up switching, i mean thats kinda the only option, or at least start looking around and setting up trial appoinements with other teachers. i lucked out and got an awesome one that really listens to my input and helps me alot more than my other teacher ever did. good luck and keep playing!|`|twLZBTIPaa	i have been playing piano for about the same span of time as you. my teacher is the same way. she picks out songs that are not particularly to my interest. haha. well, i figured out after a while, that the songs that she gives me is to practice and strengthen my skill. i've been playing for a while that it is easier to learn songs that i am interested in on my own. maybe you should try that. i thought i could never teach myself a song with out my teacher. but i've learned so many by trying. if you can read the notes, know the rhythms, i'm pretty sure you can learn them. I say stick to your teacher if you like her. thats what i did. i'm telling you, i had the same situation... haha<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer my question?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081120202749AA3v5pz">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|bF8oF3teaa	1) Be honest with your teacher. Explain that you aren't practicing because of the choice of songs. Teachers aren't mind readers and she can't know what is bothering you until you tell her.<br>  <br>  2) Present her with a song you'd like to play, and ask what songs you must learn to get to the skill level to play it.<br>  <br>  3) Have a discussion with her about your and her musical tastes. Bring in songs that you like, and ask her to find some that are like those songs that she likes.<br>  <br>  4) When she assigns you a song, ask her what this song is supposed to accomplish for you--specifically why she picked this particular song. If you hate it, ask if there's a different song you can play instead. I know I suffered through Stephen Heller for a whole semester because my teacher wouldn't discuss my repertoire with me.<br>  <br>  5) Repertoire (especially after ten years) should be a collaborative effort between the student and the teacher. The teacher has more experience in knowing what is playable and will benefit you in the future, but you need to take some responsibility as well. If you can find a song that accomplishes the same task as the song she picked for you, and you like it better, she should be willing to adapt. My students pick their repertoire after they finish the first eighteen pieces (about a year) from a fairly exhaustive list (thirty-five feet of shelf space of sheet music) with guidance from me.<br>  <br>  You don't say what level these are (ten years of not practicing much and you could still be at grade 2) but I'm sure there are songs to fit your skill level that will be fun and challenging.|`|XOgvpDiZaa	A friend of mine takes piano and wants to learn songs of her choosing, but is scared to ask since the songs she wants to learn are HARD. There must be a reason why piano teachers don't tell their students to bring in music of their own to learn...since you're teacher isn't the only one who does this.<br>  <br>  You could ask your teacher this, "Do you think I can bring in something I want to learn?" See what she says.<br>  <br>  Everything your teacher gives you is for a reson. My guitar teacher gives me exercises in the book I use (and used to give me songs) to practice that he chose, and each one was given for a reason. It wasn't to torture me, but to help me. (But then again, I didn't have the mentality of "I don't want to play this!" I just did it).|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	I would talk to her about it, ask if perhaps you can play some of your songs. But bear in mind, she probably has some very good reasons why she is making you play those songs. Maybe the songs you choose are not at your skill level. Ask her, and maybe you two can figure out a compromise. 
j5Apt8hWaa	You may want to look at your notes again.<br>  <br>  Abstract art is from the Renaissance starting in the middle of the 19th century.  It is also known sometimes as non-representational art.<br>  <br>  Therefore abstract photography would include close-ups of shapes, tonal values and patterns.  Ernst Haas is one of the most well known from the 20th century <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ernst-haas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ernst-haas.com/</a>|`|C77c0OE2aa	You are probably going to get as many different answers as people answering. That is because it is sort of like defining art. Much of it is in the eye of the beholder. What is abstract to one person may not be to another.<br>  <br>  But to try to give it definition. I would say it is any photo that is a distortion of reality, and yet, is still real. A close up shot of a wavy reflection in water would be abstract. Oftentimes, an extreme close up, (macro), shot of an object can show it in detail and an abstract way that is not normally seen. So I always have seen abstracts as reality, but not TRULY reality, if that makes sense. <br>  <br>  Like I said, you will get different answers, probably all of them correct!<br>  <br>  steve|`|PKhIXkJAaa	Abstract means non-representational, not representing or imitating external reality or the objects of nature.<br>  Here are some examples of abstract, however a few of the images are representational of something, therefore they are not abstract.They can be of part of an object etc, but they should not be recognizable. With the information I have just given you, you should be able to distinguish which are and which are not amongst the following...<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=en&safe=off&rls=com.microsoft%3Aen-us%3AIE-SearchBox&rlz=1I7SUNA&q=abstract+photo" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?um=1&hl=...</a>|`|WaJdOaFKaa	Abstraction is quite possibly one of the most difficult forms of artistic expression to define, as Steve P wrote in his answer.  Put simply, abstraction uses the relationship between form, color, and lines as a form of visual language or expression.  People go to school for years to fully understand what it means.  Abstract art is the aesthetic quality of an object, whether implied or explicit that can represent more than the object seen in any other way, depending on the viewer.  And, what is seen in one way by someone may be seen in a completely different way by someone else.  That's why there are so many different interpretations of the meaning, it's largely subjective.  You could photograph anything and it could be considered abstract to someone.  But the themes are the same, a relationship between form, color, and lines.  Find the right combination, and you'll be the next Vincent Van Gogh.<br>  <br>  Here's a website that may shed light on abstract photography:<br>  <a href="http://tedvancleave.com/abstractphotographers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tedvancleave.com/abstractphotogra...</a>|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	T.O.Rider,<br>  <br>  I like Mr. Parrot's answer. Excellent way to describe it.<br>  <br>  You might try searching for "Abstract Art", that may give you more hits/examples and it all applies to artistic photography.<br>  <br>  Historically, "Abstract" and "Photography" were never used in the same phrase because of the real or "recorded" nature of photography. Today, photography can and is any type of art you can describe. Including abstract.<br>  <br>  Enjoy and have fun.....<br>  <br>  <br>  j

Concí al guarda de un Ministerio en San José, capital de Costa Rica, mi país, que teníe sus valores firmes, sabía cuál era su deber y en una ocasión, un fin de semana,  después que los demás funcionarios habían salido del trabajo, sorprendió al Oficial Mayor (3o en poder en el Ministerio, de arriba hacia abajo) con una funcionaria jugando a girar una botella a ver a quién le tocaba quitarse una prenda de vestir, ambos ya en prendas menores y denunció a ambos ante el Ministro. No le tembló la mano aunque aquello podía significar el despido para él. Sus valores, como el de cumplir con el deber, determinó su comportamiento.

Ti garantisco che il saper scrivere correttamente è una combinazione di diversi fattori: lettura + comunicazione + apertura mentale.<br>  <br>  Ps - Dante e grandi autori a parte, ovviamente... c'è chi nasce pure con tal dono... ^_^<br>  <br>  Buon pomeriggio,<br>  Stefano.|`|qM0RIGcSaa	la prima|`|25e05c3c6f3c5cbd7a8bc1aeee048a8caa	è una pianticella cui bisogna averne molta cura|`|Pxykg5F5aa	Credo sinceramente sia un dono innato, una particolare predisposizione con cui si nasce e che non deve essere sprecata..<br>  <br>  ciao Zia!|`|BPevsYVeaa	Si impara, a scrivere.<br>  Si impara leggendo bene. Si impara ascoltando. Si impara, vogliate crederci o meno, sin dalla piu' tenera eta'.<br>  Lo scrittore "bravo" e' solo 1% d'ispirazione. Il resto, sono i continenti di cultura e criptocitazioni che si porta appresso. Lo scrittore "bravo" tesse ogni singola parola accordando ogni singolo suono. Lo scrittore "bravo" era bravo gia' in prima elementare, quando scriveva i "pensierini" piu' colorati e originali.|`|NLfhXMKRaa	Per me vale la prima...<br>  Però da sola non basta, ci vuole tanta lettura, tanto esercizio, tanta curiosità ed impegno e, forse, si riesce a scrivere decentemente...<br>  Amo scrivere perchè ho sempre amato leggere, fin da piccola, non volevo i libri con le figure ed a 5 anni leggevo già i libri di Salgari...<br>  Buona domenica, cara amaraMiao...|`|c4f6ea51c611e4f2579483a73bba738eaa	Assieme ad una pressochè assoluta mancanza di modestia - :-D -, il saper scrivere m'è sempre appartenuto, sin da bambino.<br>  E' stato un gradevole ed entusiasmante modo di esprimermi, sfogarmi, correre a perdifiato in spazi infiniti.<br>  Modo per sognare volontariamente le mie fantasie più piacevoli, eccellente sistema per comunicare, condividere anche intimamente ciò che sono, e ciò che penso.<br>  Grande facilità di esecuzione: mi basta percepire i miei pensieri e quasi si riversano da soli dalla penna, o dalla tastiera.<br>  <br>  Quindi, per me, dono innato, che mai ho dovuto manutenere o "concimare". Non volontariamente almeno, come se, ciò che sono, fosse di per sè portatore di fertilità.<br>  <br>  E, figùrati, qui in Answers ho trovato un elemento a me congeniale: ritmo "epistolare", argomenti come se piovesse, controparti sconosciute quindi oltremodo stimolanti.<br>  <br>  Mi sento di consigliare lo scrivere a chiunque, con serenità e voglia di confrontarsi CHIUNQUE - per quel che mi riguarda - è bravissimo nello scrivere.<br>  E al diavolo la grammatica, lo slang, le "K" al posto del "C", e quant'altro.<br>  Scrivere è bellissimo SEMPRE.<br>  <br>  Tante buone cose, buona giornata, e a presto.<br>  <br>  .|`|pvdWwSq9aa	Tutto si coltiva, però la scrittura bisogna coltivarla presto, dopo un po' i difetti sono difficili da correggere. Io sono convinto che nessuno è negato a niente, è tutta una questione di educazione...|`|2yttBrhXaa	Come tutto in alcuni e' un dono innato ma e' un abilita' che si puo' benissimo coltivare.<br>  <br>  Io l'ho dovuta coltivare da zero come pure ho dovuto coltivare da zero il disegno, ma per la musica avevo un dono innato. <br>  <br>  Cioe' per la musica ho dovuto lottare poco o niente mentre per le altre due e' stata una lunga strada. <br>  <br>  Cmq a volte il dono innato puo' anche essere un ostacolo perche' la facilita' con cui si impara o si esegue  un' arte non ti sprona a lottare o a dedicarti.<br>  <br>  L' importante di ogni arte e' avere buone influenze o guide. Per esempio nella scrittura leggere scrittori giusti il cui stile e maniera di pensare e' un po' come il tuo e prendere esempio da loro.  Bisogna anche imparare a essere oggettivi sul prorio lavoro.<br>  <br>  Cmq per concludere tutto si puo' imparare ma detto cio' ci vuole un po' di disposizione e passione per il soggetto.|`|3711cb723ce1005799e7f93966d59f5faa	Saper scrivere è una pianta da coltivare. Tutti possono imparare a scrivere bene. Bisogna aver qualcosa da dire e dirlo brevemente. Bisogna scrivere chiaro. Chi si nasconde dietro tanti giri di parole non sa scrivere. Chi non raggiunge lo scopo non sa scrivere. A chi vorrebbe migliorare la propria scrittura, raccomando “L’italiano – lezioni semiserie” di Beppe Severgnini. Si ride pure.|`|4549c5ea73fa553d0378e8131dd8bc03aa	Saper scrivere è sicuramente un dono innato, un talento che si ha dalla nascita. Ma solo il talento non basta occorre anche coltivare questo dono per far si che divenga una qualità unica e completa!!!!|`|CFvk6Eucaa	Mia figlia, pur avendo solo 17 anni, scrive talmente bene da lasciarmi ogni volta basita. Forse è un dono che ha ereditato da mio padre che era giornalista e scrittore, o forse è dovuto al fatto che, fin da piccolissima, divora libri come fossero noccioline. Probabilmente entrambe le cose.<br>  Qualsiasi dono, comunque, va coltivato... E se non lo si possiede, con l'impegno e la determinazione è sempre possibile acquisirlo|`|gGeJomlQaa	Certamente c'è chi è più predisposto di altri, proprio come chi sa dipingere, chi sa suonare bene uno strumento o chi sa giocare bene a calcio. però bisogna saperlo far "rendere": smussare gli spigoli, perfezionare la tecnica.<br>  il talento da solo non basta se non è disciplinato dalla dedizione, dalla pratica, dallo studio.<br>  <br>  l'esempio lampante? Guarda Cassano: un giocatore con un talento cristallino, ma senza disciplina e abnegazione rischia di rimanere una promessa mancata del calcio.<br>  Per quel che riguarda lo scrivere vale lo stesso principio.<br>  <br>  ciao,Marco|`|hE2U9Q6eaa	Un dono innato che va coltivato.<br>  Come la maggior parte delle cose.|`|kuzIjIWWaa	è un dono che và coltivato.<br>  la vena poetica prescinde un'anima pulita, spesso sofferente.<br>  <br>  solo chi soffre conosce veramente l'amore, e con esso,<br>  tutte le gioie e i dolori che provoca.<br>  <br>  chi non è aperto, sensibile, e soprattutto altruista,<br>  non riesce a scrivere che:<br>  "con tanta allegria qui ti lascio la firma mia"|`|zPQCipoBaa	La penso come Well.  <br>  <br>  Sicuramente è utile avere una certa predisposizione, ma io credo che tutti "in nuce" abbiano la capacità di saper esrimere i propri pensieri, narrare le proprie vicende, esporre le prorie riflessioni in modo chiaro, corretto e personale. <br>  Lo stile "inconfondibile" di una certa voce rispetto ad un'altra è, sì, un dono ma un dono che va coltivato,  sviluppato, curato, se no si spegne e muore. <br>  Nemici del "saper scrivere" sono le fretta e la sciatteria. <br>  <br>  Ci si deve un po' vergognare a mettere sotto gli occhi di tutti un testo scorretto, raffazzonato e confuso, dote che mi sembra appannaggio di pochi, ormai.  <br>  Se non si prova questa sana e salutare vergogna le proprie capacità di comunicazione non andranno oltre il "passami il sale" e il il "ri sr mi sn dvrt un ca.sino!"
AA10084471	"Richard Cory"  It is a poem by Edwin Arlington Robinson<br>  <br>  Whenever Richard Cory went down town,<br>  We people on the pavement looked at him:<br>  He was a gentleman from sole to crown,<br>  Clean favored, and imperially slim.<br>  <br>  And he was always quietly arrayed,<br>  And he was always human when he talked;<br>  But still he fluttered pulses when he said,<br>  "Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.<br>  <br>  And he was rich, richer than a king—<br>  And admirably schooled in every grace:<br>  In fine, we thought that he was everything<br>  To make us wish that we were in his place.<br>  <br>  So on we worked, and waited for the light,<br>  And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;<br>  And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,<br>  Went home and put a bullet through his head.<br>  <br>  It was also made into a folk song by Simon and Garfunkle.|`|6LGqNGHJaa	it's a book called "Turning Tables" by John Finch|`|Saqfoijxaa	IT'S A SONG ABOUT CORY|`|dHREVNXDaa	Beauty In the Beast. jk I dont Know Why dont You look for Quotes that say THat.|`|eiyQCLLVaa	Turning Tables: John Finch|`|JZi1H4BZaa	Not a fairy tale...

cnj6fqpyaa	I once had a theory that we are a story going on in a schitzophrenic frogs head because he is bored, sitting on a lilly pad with nobody to talk to. He actually believes this is all real because he is schitzophrenic. One day, the frogs doctors will come up with a cure and that is when this world will end.<br>  <br>  Everything is possible and you are definitely not the first person to think this. I personally feel that rationally, everything that exists once started as an idea. Take your computer for instance. Even you. Your parents had the idea to have sex and make you (sorry). Everything you see with your eyes must have come from the mind of something or someone. For something to be created, it has to have been thought of first. Maybe what we see now is just the thought and one day it will be created and made real...<br>  <br>  Keep your mind open and let the mysteries of life give it a little kiss every once in a while.|`|5bkmSQ3Raa	Hey, it could be like that, but, let's face it, if it's just a figment of someone's imagination, it's a pretty darn good and very real figment.

u0zEutf1aa	Basically, Erik is a genius, but he has a hideous face that makes the world fear him (that's the answer to the mask question). He lives alone under an opera house, until he falls in love with a young woman named Christine, and will do anything to keep her with him.<br>  <br>  The play and book are pretty different. Without giving much away, the book focuses more on dark aspects, while the musical is more about the romance. The book also has some characters the play omits. I suggest you read the book first.<br>  <br>  If the show will be playing in your hometown, that's the best thing. (It's going to be here in San Francisco soon! Woohoo!) If not, you can buy the Original London soundtrack. Michael Crawford has the most awesome voice as Erik. You can also rent the 2004 movie, which isn't perfect, but is pretty good. I'd suggest you read the book or see the musical before watching it, though. <br>  <br>  (I also recommend the Chaney 1925 silent film. It doesn't follow the book all that well in some parts, but it's still a great classic film. The actors do a great job considering it's silent.)<br>  <br>  ?M?|`|aMORxV6yaa	The Phantom (Erik) wears the mask because he was born with a horrible deformity all over his face and his mother made him the mask.

He falls in love with Christine, one of the dancers.<br>  I saw the musical first, and I wish I would have read the book first.<br>  I dont know what versions of the musical you can watch, but the movie from like, 2005? is really good.|`|E8MUtC52aa	i would watch the movie. i havent read the book, but the most recent movie they made a couple years back was really really good!<br>  <br>  the phantom lives in the opera house and falls in love with a new singer and she falls in love with another guy.<br>  <br>  i dont want to ruin too much, but just watch it.|`|UWIVOidYaa	I would watch the movie first. That will get you excited-- but that's just what I did. I like the 2004 movie adaptation of the musical the best (with Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler), but that's just me. I haven't seen all of them, mind you.<br>  I started reading the book, and I really like it so far. I can't tell you a whole lot about it, because I don't know a whole lot about it. Ask Magda! Here's a link to read it for free, legally: <a href="http://www.webliterature.net/literature/Leroux/WL1-phantom_opera/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webliterature.net/literature/...</a> That site's great by the way-- it has a ton of classics.<br>  The movie, however, I can tell you about. It's probably my favorite movie ever, ever, ever. I even have my avatar styled after the Phantom. It's about a Parisian opera house. There is a phantom who lives in the basement-type area. The managers give him what he wants and humor him. But when the opera house comes under new management, the Phantom's requests are no longer met, and he gets angry. Various things go wrong. Meanwhile, the Phantom takes on a protegee for singing lessons: Christine Daae the ballet girl. Christine takes the stage by storm, being a newly Phantom-trained soprano, and soon Raol falls in love with her. The Phantom doesn't like that. Complications ensue (I don't want to spoil everything!). All this takes place to a great, dramatic soundtrack that I never get tired of. It's a very dramatic movie, and I like it a lot. I want to see the actual musical on stage.<br>  The Phantom wears a mask because his face is deformed by acid (at least in the 2004 movie). Plus, it's pretty mysterious and adds to the story.|`|nVvYTvbbaa	You should absolutely watch the movie version with Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum. They were amazing! <br>  Here's a summary that won't spoil the ending for you:<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Phantom-of-the-Opera/Gaston-Leroux/e/9780060809249/?itm=1" rel="nofollow">http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Pha...</a>|`|HsAhBHy2aa	It's a very, very beautiful story and I think you should read Gaston Leroux's novel "Phantom of the Opera", then Susan Kay's "Phantom". You should ABSOLUTELY watch the Musical by Andrew Lloyd Webber FIRST. THEN watch the movie or Yeston and Kopit or Ken Hill's Musical Version.<br>  <br>  Deff. start with the books and the movie with Gerard and Emmy last.<br>  <br>  Basic Plot:<br>  <br>  A young girl named Christine Daae is visisted by a mysterious voice who she thinks is the "Angel of Music" her dead Father promised to send her once he was in Heaven.<br>  The voice teaches her how to sing like an Angel and she soon triumphs at the Paris Opera, ooutshining the current star soprano, Carlotta.<br>  It is at the Opera that her former childhood friend and sweetheart Raoul de Chagny hears her and is once again taken by her sweetness and beauty. He wants a relationship with Christine, but she has already promised her heart and soul to the mysterious Angel of Music.<br>  But Christine soon finds out he is no Angel...he is the myserious Phantom of the Opera who has been playing tricks and haunting the Paris Opera for years...and he has fallen terribly in love with Christine.<br>  <br>  He kidnaps her and brings her to his lair below the Opera house. He wears a mask and will not let Christine look at his face. Over taken by curiosity, Christine unmasks him, wanting to see the beautiful face that should go along with his Angelic voice. She is very mistaken. She is caught up in a desperate love triangle between the two men. The Phantom who she fears but cannot bring herself to hate him, and her childhood sweetheart who she cannot deny.<br>  <br>  She is given an ultimatum by the mysterious Phantom, and her choice could kill or save many people's lives..including Raouls.<br>  <br>  It is a tragic and wonderful story. Especially Susan Kay's Phantom, because she gives you a look at Erik's (The Phantom) life from beginning to end. Why he is the way he is, that kind of thing. You WILL be moved by his story.<br>  <br>  The Phantom wears a mask because he is terribly deformed and ugly.<br>  <br>  Please, don't watch the Emmy/Gerard movie first. They took such a beautiful, tragic story and ruined its message. They made the Phantom into a hot, gorgeous hunk when he is exactly the opposite. They made Christine seem stupid and spacey the entire movie. You are supposed to realize that true beauty lies within and you are supposed to see Erik for what he REALLY is.<br>  Please, please, PLEASE read Gaston Leroux and Susan Kay and watch the musical first. Trust me on this....you will get the full message of the story and see how amazing it is in comparison to the 2004 abomination they call a movie.|`|RRTetjJ4aa	My opinion. I saw the 2004 movie and loved it (the one with gerald butler and emmy rossum). I know that many people did not like it for several reasons and I have seen where they are coming from but I disagree. I thought that acting was wonderful and the singing was great! I have even listened unbelievably closely to try to see if they sing off note but still it all seems fine to me. So I would recommend watching that movie and then judging it yourself. <br>  <br>  Anyway, read the book. Make sure to get the original novel by Gaston Leroux. There are a lot of different stories based on it adn if you read those first I don't think the original novel will be as good. <br>  <br>  You get a lot more from the book than you get from the movie and the events are a bit different. <br>  <br>  This is how I figure: <br>  If you see the movie and then read the book (what happened to me) you will probably like the movie because you have nothing to compare it too. You will like the whole plot and see nothing wrong with it. Then read the book and it adds details you can't get from the movie. Some of which are different. <br>  <br>  If you read the book first, you may be a bit confused but you will probably still like it. If you don't know the plot it may appear boring but just keep reading. THe only problem is then, when you are watching the movie, you will pick out all the differences between the movie and the book and therefore become annoyed with the movie and hate it. <br>  <br>  Not saying either of those things will happen, just my guess. <br>  <br>  Moving on: basic plot: <br>  There is a man who is the phantom of the opera. (his name is erik, but in the movie, they never say his name they just call him the phantom, Opera Ghost, etc. in the book, his name is Erik.) He is a man, not a ghost. They call him this because some of the things he does is "ghost-like" <br>  <br>  He lives under the opera house next to the underground lake. He moves his way through the opera through trapdoors. 2 new managers, take over the opera house. Erik writes them letters asking for 20,000 francs and for him to always sit in box 5. But they don't believe in "the opera ghost" <br>  <br>  Erik is obsessed with a young soprano named chistine daae. She is a chorus girl. But Christine reconizes her childhood friend, Raoul. They fall in love but Erik still loves Christine and will do anything for her. <br>  <br>  I will leave it at this because I don't want to spoil the whole thing. <br>  And the phantom wears his mask because he is severly deformed and is shun out of society because of it. In the book, he has a full mask. In the movie, he has half of one. He looks like a "death's face". <br>  <br>  The movie verison that is most like the book is the 1925 silent verison. That is a good one to see as well. Some things are changed though. <br>  <br>  Oh, another cool thing is, this is based on a true story.<br>  <br>  Wow, I really rambled on. Well, I hope this was enough info. You may become obsessed and be able to write that same amount of info that I just did. I could write more but this is taking to long. :)|`|qEh84eqNaa	Others have given detailed answers on the book, so I'll focus on the musical.<br>  <br>  Personally, I ADORE the Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum movie that was released a few years ago. It's amazing. Gerard's voice isn't perfect, but I prefer him over any other Phantom because his voice is so full of passion-- listening to him sing touches my soul (oh my gosh, how corny can a person sound? But, hey, it's true). He makes me feel the emotion of the Phantom so well that it's scary. His voice just really affects me in a profound way. Emmy Rossum has an amazing voice as well. IMO, she's much, MUCH better than Sarah Brightman, who played Christine in the original version. I love the Emmy and Gerard together. The music in the movie is also really good (here I am referring to the instrumental, not the voices), since they had a budget. I think the movie is amazing-- it's one of my all time favorites. It's the kind of movie that I can watch over and over again and still get something new out of it each time. I don't really like the Broadway version, though-- Sarah's voice annoys me too much.<br>  <br>  The movie focuses on the Phantom and the object of his obsessive love, Christine. The Phantom has a horrible face deformity and has been shunned all of his life because of it. He lives in the bottom of the Opera house and is a musical genius. Christine came to live at the Opera House after the death of her father and is training to be a ballerina. Before her father died, he promised her he'd send her the "Angel of Music". The Phantom loves Christine and hence pretends to be the Angel of Music. He teaches her how to sing. I personally feel that Christine is also in love with him, to an extent, or at least cares deeply for him (not really in the book, but I get that impression in the musical). After the dramatic lead of the Opera storms out of the Opera house, Christine is cast as the lead. Afterwards she meets her childhood sweetheart, Raoul, and they start to develop a relationship again. The Phantom obviously isn't very happy with that, and Christine feels torn, because she feels obligated to and compassion for the Phantom, but knows she will be happiest with Raoul. Everything starts to unfold from there.<br>  <br>  The book is really good, but I prefer the musical. I saw the musical first, though, which is probably why I like it better. The book focuses more of the injustice done to the Phantom because of his physical appearance, whereas the musical is more about the romance. Both versions are beautiful, touching, and awe-inspiring stories.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT WATCH THE 2004 MOVIE FIRST. Horrible acting/singing, ruined the whole thing. Okay, now that that's over with, let's move on. XD<br>  <br>  I would recommend reading the book first. The book and the musical are very different, but the plots are pretty much the same.<br>  <br>  The Phantom wears a mask because his face is deformed. In the musical, half of his face is deformed. In the book, his entire face is deformed, but not as drastically, more like a skeleton. He was born that way, and no one has loved him throughout his life because of it.<br>  <br>  Christine Daae is a young opera singer/chorus girl (depends on version) who starts receiving voice lessons from an unknown source (Erik, the Phantom). The Phantom is in love with her. (He lives under the opera house.) It is his mission to further her opera career and also to eventually have her live with him. The trouble starts up when Christine meets an old childhood friend/lover (again, version differences), Raoul. They soon fall in love, and Christine is caught up in the wrong vertex of a love triangle like no other.<br>  <br>  Beware: You may become obsessed. This is one of the most beautiful stories of all time. The book is darker and less romantic, the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is more mushy-gooshy. I love both. As I said before, the 2004 movie version of the ALW musical is horrible. It was ruined by bad acting and lack of singing skills. I do not recommend it, as it is an insult to Gaston Leroux.<br>  <br>  Look for tour dates of the actual musical in your area, and in the meantime, check out the book. Enjoy!

r2xBRMBcaa	To Kill a Mockingbird by  Harper Lee<br>  <br>  CHARACTER ANALYSIS <br>  <br>  Atticus Finch <br>  <br>  Atticus Finch, the father of Scout and Jem, is a highly respected and responsible citizen of Maycomb County. An attorney by profession, he has always tried to instill good values and a sense of moral propriety in his children. <br>  <br>  Atticus’ relation with his children is unique. He lets them call him by his name. Though outwardly detached and always busy with his work, he does manage to find the time and patience to explain the intricacies of human nature to his children. When Scout comes home from school, upset at being reprimanded for already knowing how to read, Atticus teaches her to compromise with the situation. By continuing to take lessons from the teacher, and at the same time, reading with her father at home, both could be kept happy. Thus, Atticus teaches his daughter, in her impressionable years itself, the mature demeanor of how to conduct oneself in public, and at the same time luxuriate in one’s own decisions.

Fluiv8Zraa	Terminology is such a language barrier. If I understand what you are saying you equate double beats with part of a paradiddle? If so, double beat is when the stick hits twice on one hand. This pattern is a paraddidle; RLRRLRLL and so on. All strokes are evenly spaced. Another pattern is a double stroke roll, or RRLLRRLL etc. Other than that I have no idea what you mean. Check with a drum teacher at a local music store. Heck, even take a few lessons.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I think you mean "double strokes" RRLLRRLL.

You start off with a slow tempo first until you can do it real fast. After you master the slow "flam" correctly, then you increase your tempo slowly until you do it lightning fast.  This is a very common drum trick in doing drum solos...doing flams on the Toms with your hands and flams with your feet on the Bass Drums simultaneously.  I hope that was what you were looking for.

Nel 1933 è invasa la provincia dello Jehol, ai confini con la Mongolia interna. Nel maggio dello stesso anno, con una tregua siglata a Tangku, il Giappone ottiene la demilitarizzazione di una larga fascia di territorio cinese a sud della Grande Muraglia.<br>  <br>  Per Sabrymitica: volevo chiederti da dove ti è uscita la data che hai scritto e  soprattutto a quale armistizio ti riferisci?<br>  <br>  Per shinichi: devi aver fatto un po' di confusione perché l'armistizio dell' 8 settembre 1943 riguardava l’Italia e gli angloamericani.|`|HP1Oe8Wxaa	8 settembre 1993 facile no?<br>  Ma perchè non cerchi qui<br>  su wikipedia è la migliore<br>  10 punti please

47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	i totally agree with you.  Meyers writing style is flat, boring, dull, and repetitive compared to Rowlings.  the characters in the harry potter books just seem so much more developed, ya know? they actually have real history about them.  you get to know pretty much everything about them over the course of the books.  you just dont get that with twilight.  so i like the plot line to harry potter better, and the depth to which everything is developed.  i mean, for god sakes there are suppliment  books to harry potter.  you can read some of his text books! (magical beasts and where to find them along with one other, and now Tales of Beedle the Bard have all been published).  i mean, what author does that? has ADITIONAL books based soley on the history of her books?<br>  <br>  ps, to all the twilighters, screeching "omg, lyk, twilight is better because edward is so hot" isnt going to help you, because if you remember correctly, robert pattenson played character in a harry potter movie before twilight was ever even THOUGHT to be turned into a movie<br>  <br>  edit: im bored at work, so here we go. this is in response to an answer below me<br>  1.) Rowling came out before Meyer.  No one as far as i know has tried comparing Rowling to Meyer, other then the fact that  both books got wildly popular.   how can rowling be humble about meyer in any way when no one has compared rowling to meyer? its all meyer being compared to rowling.<br>  <br>  2.) Rowling is far from cliched and mediocre. im not even sure what about her writing style you find cliched and mediocre.  meanwhile, meyer apparently couldnt find her thesaurus while she was writing because there were so many words she over used, to the point where i wanted to MAIL her a thesaurus and say "here, use this next time".  as for everyone reading twilight, all types of people read harry potter too.  i went to the midnight release parties. i saw little kids begging their parents to stay up late and read it to them when they got home.  i saw 18-22 year olds like me excited to continue reading the stories we started in middle school. i saw the 60 year old manager of the book store DANCING because he was so happy the newest book was out and mad that the store owner wouldnt let him throw a shindig as big as they did for the sixth book.  harry potter's audience is just as diverse as meyers.  my town alone is enough to prove it, let alone compareing it to the rest of the world<br>  <br>  3.)No man as seemingly perfect as edward  cullen exist,  he is a womans idea of a perfect man.  therefor all the little girls falling in love with him are in for a world of disapointment when they realize one day that there are no real edward cullens.  plus edward is borderline abusive.  you have to be blind not to see it. <br>  <br>  4.) Stephanie Meyer was published after Harry Potter.  the market for fantasy books is much bigger now because of harry potter.  the book company was obviously hoping that twilight would  be as much of a success as harry potter.  notice the large amount of fantasy books that have been published SINCE harry potter.  without potter to open that market, Meyer would be in the same position as Rowling was when she first wrote harry potter<br>  <br>  5.) see 4.  no one saw a market for that type of fantasy when she went to publish harry potter.  now there is a market so its much  easier for fantasy books to get picked up on<br>  <br>  6.) she sued her fans because it was indeed proven that they were breaking copyrights.  midnight sun had not been copywritten at the time it was leaked, therefor, even if meyer wanted to sue, she wouldnt have been able to because it hadnt been copywritten yet<br>  <br>  6.) ya ever happen to notice the dedication pages at the start of every harry potter book? you think the publisher just makes up all that **** about her thanking everyone?  plus i have read and watched interviews with her.  she has thanked the fans, millions of times over.  your just overlooking it because it doesnt help your arguments<br>  <br>  7.)rowling is involved in ONE lawsuit.  over OBVIOUS breaches in copyrights.  other authors in the past have done the same, authors in the future will do the same as well.  this type of thing is hardly anything new.  <br>  <br>  8.) once again, your acting like rowling is the  first person ever to talk about such stuff.  loads of famous people and not famous people talk about this sort of thing.  people like sharing their successes in that way hoping it inspires someone else to do something.  besides that, fans are  curious about where she came from, who she is.  this is part of her story, why SHOULDNT she share it?  this argument has absolutly no relevance to proving that meyer is the better author.<br>  <br>  9.) A)what the **** is a jumped up woman? B)look at divorce statistics.  LOTS of people get divorced. how in ANY way does this argument help you determine that meyer is a better AUTHOR?  ooo, she got divorced. so did nine million other couples in this world.  <br>  <br>  10.) rowling is awsome.  her books created a whole new world, with differant creatures than had previously been created, new ideas, new places, new things.  stephanie meyer took characters and stuck them in a world that already existed.  the only thing she thought of that was new is that vampires apparently sparkle.  <br>  <br>  all around fail there darling.  you repeated your points several times, just in differant words.  a lot of your points were not even relevant to who was the better author, which is what the question was about.  plus you had two 6)s.|`|Rc4Chlw3aa	Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* Rowling! *clap clap clap* <br>  <br>  LMAO.

Stephenie Meyers advocates obsession, weak heroines, and domineering males. <br>  <br>  After reading Twilight, teenage girls get the impression that if you find out some guy has been coming in your bedroom at night, instead of worrying that he might be dangerous, you should be concerned that he might have heard you say something embarrassing in your sleep. <br>  <br>  J.K. Rowling isn't perfect, but at least Hermione Granger has some sense, and confidence.|`|ykVzJsc6aa	I would go for Twilight...though Harry Potter did keep me up all night as did the Twilight Series....but just personally, I find Twilight a bit more entertaining at times, while Harry Potter sometimes got a bit confusing with what goes where and who got killed why...<br>  + when Harry hooked up with Ginny, it just screwed up everything for me....|`|BzMQejGxaa	A few problems with Natalie's answer:<br>  1.) Why would Rowling care about Stephenie Meyer? This isn't a dinner party- you don't have to return the compliment.<br>  <br>  2.) Meyer's writing style is pretentious tosh that makes no sense. Rowling's might not be wonderful but she doesn't just pick words out of the thesaurus and she concentrates on weaving a complex story, not fiddling about with adjectives.<br>  <br>  3.) Meyer has ripped off classic authors by stealing their romantic heroes and then has the audacity to say that Eddie Cullen is better than all of them. Bella is a Mary Sue- everybody wants to be Bella. Eddie is 2-dimentional- the character is defined by their beauty (and Meyer has to convince us of this ALL THE TIME) and them being a vampire. Poor Harry may not be the most complex character, but it's the adventure that is interesting and the details of the world.<br>  <br>  4.) Never even heard of Little and Brown, but I'll take your word for it's size. Meyer was accepted because the company wanted an American version of Rowling to get them lots of money.<br>  <br>  5.) Exactly the same reason.<br>  <br>  6.) You do too much research. Anyhow you don't even know Stephenie Meyer so who are you to judge?<br>  <br>  6.) Rude assumption. Lots of authors don't and I think it's self indulgent.<br>  <br>  7.)Again you don't know Meyer. Stop calling her Steph, it's impertinent.<br>  <br>  8.) You can't dislike someone because they're a single mother.<br>  <br>  9.) Meyer's religious. It's different in bible belt america.|`|JD6NikJjaa	I don't like comparing them but I will this time. Harry Potter and Twilight are totally different, people compare them because of the two huge fanbases . Although, I have to admit, Twilights fanbaze is getting out of hand. One of my friend told Edward Cullen was a stupid fictious character and my other friend slapped her and cried.<br>  Anyway, Harry Potter is a legend, the character are really well- developed and you really get to know them well. I have grown up with them. There part of my life. J.K Rowling is one lucky gal but she is a genius and I really admire her for this world she's created, and what she's been through. Thes tory as a whole is really good although personally I don't like her writing style, it's a bit slow and tiresome.<br>  Twilight, on the other hand is a great book to, not the best, but still a great book. Stephanie writes really good dialogue in my opinion, and her writing style I really like, it's sort of edgy and fluid. Twilight a romance novel. Harry Potter's a fantasy novel, witha bit of everything; surrealness, mythical creatures, drop of romance, ystery, action. <br>  Harry Potter here to stay, I know it will in my heart. It's a clasic.Time will tell about Twilight, it might be a fad but that doesn't really matter, it's still a really good book and Edward and Bella are really interesting characters too although Harry Potter character's have alot of history too them. I love tonks!
Uyf8Kkq1aa	yes i do have the same problem i can't believe edward isn't real lol<br>  <br>  anyway you got to say to your self ' twilight is not real' ' it's fictional'<br>  <br>  and get rid of those books well don't like burn them or something giev them to a friend so she can hang on to them and talk to her about your habit.<br>  <br>  hope it helps it helps me now friend won't give tehm back becouse now she is an twilght addict too lol<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|Xc02z608aa	Read the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind.

Personally, I loved it - but, it's a matter of taste.<br>  <br>  You could also try "Crown Duel" by Sherwood Smith, which has a lot of action and some great romance, or "Sabriel" by Garth Nix, which is the first book in the "Abhorsen Trilogy." Both are fantastic examples of YA fantasy. <br>  <br>  The Wrinkle in Time books are good, but might be too easy, considering they were written, for the most part, with children - and not teens - in mind.<br>  <br>  Stephenie Meyer also has "The Host" out. It's more Sci-fi than Fantasy, but it's definitely worth looking into - especially if you enjoyed the Twilight series. <br>  <br>  There's also "The Pellinor"series, by Alison Croggon - which begins with "The Naming." It's actually a fairly decent series, and most people who've read it have enjoyed it immensely. <br>  <br>  I've also heard good things about the author Tamora Pierce, who wrote "Trickster's Choice" - among various other novels. Her style is refreshing, and her books are really good at grabbing your attention.<br>  <br>  If you're into vampires, there's also the "Vampire Academy" series by Richelle Mead, the "Last Vampire" series by Christopher Pike, or the "Blue Bloods" books by Melissa de la Cruz.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

xopIi2Vfaa	there is no best. Just like there is no best medicine. It depends what disease you have which is the best. <br>  The best material for you depends on what you want to express, what you want to do (size, color, texture, weight), what experience you have and what facilities you have (access to kiln, access to foundry, access to tools ).<br>  <br>  You can use drawings or photographs to help you to make a head. You can take actual measurements of somebodies head (how far from the nose to the mouth/chin, how far the eyes are apart, circumference of the head and so on). <br>  Depending on the material you use you will need an armature. <br>  <br>  Just head to the library, there are likely to be books about modeling a bust.

Think about it, a massive amount of suicides or genocide will not fix the over population of the Earth by people, with your plan we would have to keep doing that over and over. You would have to exercise population control by reducing "breeding," China actually has laws to limit the number of children a family can have. True, people cause the earth's problems because without us their is no one to care about the problems or cause many of the problems in the first place, but killing people, even without discrimination, will not fix the problems.

Just burying them sounds daunting, not to mention the collection and registration of those deaths. 72,771,500 people died in world war 2, a fraction of what this mass suicide would bring about.<br>  <br>  Also it'd be a very temporary solution. The worlds birth rate is about 134 million babies per year. Based on the 62 million deaths in 2006, <br>  one could deduce that about 42% of the births that happen in a year are canceled out by another persons death. We could reasonably expect the world's population back up to 6.7 billion in 46 years.<br>  <br>  Based on that, I'd have to say I'd be one of the people that would be "selfish" or smart rather. <br>  <br>  I'd also have to talk about the social ramifications.

XD I can't help but looking at this from my religion's point of view, so I'm sorry if that creeps in. I'll do my best to be unbiased...<br>  <br>  I've never bought this whole 'more people is the problem' thing. No, more people is the SOLUTION. Ever heard the saying 'two heads are better than one'? Every person has a unique talent inside of them that can help the world. Very few people die in this world without contributing to it somehow. The murder of anyone takes away a little bit of good that could have happened.<br>  <br>  Ghandi once said, "Nature has enough to supply every man's need, but not every man's greed." The problem is not that there's not enough food/resources to go around. It's just that they're not going around. Of course, oil is going to run out eventually. That's why I support alternative energy solutions to fervently (we're not going to run out of wind, sunlight, moving water, etc). In many richer countries obesity is a major problem, while in most of Africa people are starving to death every day. Killing people won't solve this. Getting people to band together to treat everyone equally and distributing the world's resources more evenly will. This is hard, because it is in our nature to want things for ourselves. But we are perfectly capable of rising above this. People prove it every day.<br>  <br>  Volunteering yourself to die isn't really selfless...in fact, it's almost selfish. You could be a missionary in third world countries, or start an organization that helps get clean water to people who don't have it, etc. But instead dying seems more like to me you just want to get out of all the problems.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe God solves problems, than who does? Animals? The stars? No. People solve problems. Having less people won't solve anything.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to insult your intelligence or your ideas. Your ideas are good, and you're really looking at the big picture here. Remember: change starts with you. As Ghandi (have you noticed I really like him? XD) said, "Be the change you wish to see in the world."<br>  <br>  Have a wonderful day!<br>  <br>  |`|fynzkVK4aa	Hmm I kinda see what you are getting at, but human nature being what it is I think the only things your policy would be likely to achieve would be war as people tried to stand up to the rules, or corruption, as people paid to get out of "the draft" or whatever you want to call it (historical precedent for that from aristocrats in both WWs paying to avoid their relatives being drafted), and if it was random weirdly an increase in the birth rate as studies have shown that people faced with death get a bit randy!<br>  <br>  Also for the randomness thing, what if it threw up a disproportionate number of nurses, or doctors, or teachers, etc., even say binmen, or other important roles in society..what if you exterminated all the "useful" people and were only left with dregs, who sat around popping out babies whilst fiddling the black market to raise cash to avoid being in the random drafts?!!?<br>  <br>  In all honesty, I don't think it is numbers so much as attitudes that cause the problems; for example, someone in a third world country living hand to mouth with no "modern luxuries" really is not having a huge impact on the planet; in fact 100 such people probably make about the same amount of negative impact on the planet as 1 modern living westerner, so perhaps a "back to basics" approach, reducing our reliance on modern technologies for luxury's sake, would have a better and more effective impact than simply culling random people...|`|10Q2oeD6aa	It is known that the resources on earth can support only 2 billion people and we have already reached the 6.5 billion, so yeah, mass extermination could be a perfect solution (as horrible as it may sound).<br>  <br>  btw... have you heard about Social Cannibalism?|`|b97fed3d13f4b14ab8585aa05b8457e5aa	earth is just a stepping stone my friend you can end your life here but what happens after|`|iz5cP6l8aa	how would we benfit thou<br>  sure less resources being used<br>  but does that solve the problem<br>  so instead of 50 years from the oil is used up<br>  now it would 150 years<br>  this wouldnt solve our basic problem|`|4028712e620e658c94a48c6d10f37b2daa	I remember many years ago a computer program, I think it was called Fox and geese. or something like that. it was from a scientific journal.  the program was designed to create models of complex nature and interactions.  I think it was research into the mathematics of population masses of different species and how they had developed in nature.   there seemed to be a direct correlation in the data, that all species go through a period of growth that goes beyond the capacity of which it can be sustained.  Nature always seems to have a way or balancing this out.  I think the fox and gees reference was looking at predators and prey as an obvious example. more foxes need more geese. the fewer geese the fewer foxes, or some such.<br>  <br>  how or if this applies to humanity is probably another theory. But there are always things like influenza, bird flue, aids, etc... and who knows what diseases nature may throw at us in the future.<br>  <br>  as far as suicide is concerned. that's still quite a contentious subject. however I feel that it should be a matter of choice for the individual.<br>  <br>  the reason most of society objects to it is for religious reasons, as it is considered a sin by many faiths. though in war, self sacrifice is considered a noble thing?|`|HENguBYaaa	So you think that the thousands of people dieing every day from starvation, disease and natural disasters is not enough?  Removal of 50 % of the worlds population right now would cause more problems than solutions. And what if someone you loved became part of that  'random mass extermination' could you honestly just sit back and say 'Oh well it's all for the good human kind'. No matter what way you dress it up it is a more selfish idea to want to kill others for your own survival than it is for people to want the right to their life.Wanting to live is not selfish. Would you willingly give up your life? Sure you could make room for brilliant scientists or doctors but you would also be giving up your life for murderers an thieves.<br>  Even if this did happen, the 50% left would continue to consume resources and with hardly any competition would continue to multiply until the Earth was once again filled with 'far too many humans'
54ZnThnQaa	I used to have this problem to, for me it was because i hade the wrong type of pointe shoes, as the balls of my feet are big i got bloch sonata and it's alot better now|`|lHSEmMtxaa	a few ideas:<br>  a) try a little less padding. cramming too much into your pointe shoes is never a good idea. <br>  b) stretch out your calves and tendons (tense legs/muscles lead to tense feet and toes)<br>  c) do a lot of work on demi-pointe. it might be that your trying to do too much on pointe. the more you work on demi-pointe, the more your feet will adjust to the feeling. <br>  d) pointe hurts-- as you probably know. good luck!|`|3QK8Kbzkaa	ill give you a foot massage :) |`|pWlVHm6kaa	Either not enough cushion in the toe of the shoe (you are adding something right?) or you'll just have to get use to it.

9yAo9Jdnaa	Hello<br>  <br>  During my family history research I had a similar problem as yourself.  <br>  <br>  Firstly you say you are applying for a copy of the Birth Certificate for the baby of your Great Aunt - As this is in the 1960s for this you would need the exact date of birth and the original birth name registered (possibly registered under the Surname of your Great Aunt as she was unmarried at this time).  If you have these details you will be able to obtain a copy of the original birth certificate<br>  <br>  To apply for a copy of an adoption certificate certain criteria has to be met to receive a copy of the certificate and there are two versions of certificate (full & short), both require the exact date of birth and adoptive name of the child.<br>  <br>  If you know the full name of the child taken after adoption, together with the full date of birth you will be able to obtain a copy of the adoption certificate. If you don't know these details it will not be possible.<br>  <br>  I hope the above may help as relatives of an 'adopted person' have the hardest time finding out answers - I know from experience.  <br>  <br>  After trawling the web and speaking with certain 'advisors' (who appeared 'indifferent' to my plight - SO disheartening),  I found the following website and spoke with a 'real person' who really understood my need and offered real information.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.certifiedcertificatesuk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.certifiedcertificatesuk.com</a><br>  <br>  |`|nssP8Lp0aa	Adoption Records Search Form<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.govtregistry.com/uk.php?sk=Adoption&tc=ml25l101" rel="nofollow">http://www.govtregistry.com/uk.php?sk=Ad...</a><br>  <br>  
AA11621125	coincidentally, i have gone through the same experience (my uncle past away three and a half years ago)<br>  first, i am so sorry for your loss, and i really hope and believe writing can help the mourning process.<br>  second, in terms of writing: <br>  what i found really helpful is writing a sort letter to my uncle. i wrote about what i missed about  him, his most memorable traits, his funny habits, his strength (he lived for many years past what was predicted with a genetic disease), and how much i truly loved him in my life.<br>  i have started to notice that his life surfaces in my poetry often because it had an impact on my spiritual life and the way i value the world. for example, here's part of a poem i wrote around his birthday recently: <br>  <br>  Today<br>  was/is <br>  his birthday<br>  placed there/ plopped there<br>  on a house made of <br>  wooden boards<br>  and raised onto silts <br>  like a strangley awkward <br>  animal<br>  maybe a bird, <br>  or a goat<br>  His mother believed <br>  that the two laundry mats <br>  colored and whites,<br>  were for separate <br>  dyes of clothing<br>  she muddles through mathematics<br>  like that goat/bird<br>  with three legs<br>  a di-pod <br>  becomes a tri-pod<br>  when the marrow dissolves.<br>  <br>  It doesnt have to make sense, it just has to mean something to you. good luck.
lzEuuseJaa	Warm up, warm up, warm up! It really helps! It's especially important if your voice hasn't fully changed or recently changed. <br>  <br>  You should have a CD or ipod of exercises that you warm up to. It should work on your full range. If you don't have a warm up CD, ask your voice teacher or a teacher at school to help you with one. My son's is a voice teacher playing the piano and doing the exercises, and him doing the exercises with piano, and with just piano. You know, the whole Gug gug gugs and neh neh nehs etc. = )<br>  <br>  Also, if you have a voice teacher, ask how to hit the note. There are little *tricks*, certain ways to pronounce, ways to keep your vocal cords open if your voice isn't finished changing.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Not sure if this is what you were looking for, but I've heard that pineapple juice is good for your voice.
CjPtAEzmaa	For me?<br>  <br>  1. I think the children are looking up and holding (as in grasping), onto wonder (or curiosity, hope, or belief, or all of those things that we are able to believe in so faithfully when we are children but gradually fade away). The simile 'like a cup' makes me picture them wanting their cup to be filled, as in, they are asking the world, "Do you really have beauty? Love? Magic? I want wonder, it seems to be fading." <br>  <br>  2. Gold, while valuable and precious, is also very malleable (can be bent and formed easily). 'Music like a curve of gold' makes me think that music can be thought of many different ways by different people and can affect each person differently (in other words, it is malleable) and perhaps because of this it is precious and valuable (gold).|`|eAcIYryyaa	1) I think it's a child looking up to see suprises in thier life.<br>  <br>  2) I think it's reffering to the sound of music.
CjPtAEzmaa	I'm assuming you're talking about singing.<br>  <br>  You can use vibrato in pretty much any song; it is most common in opera though, so you might check out some arias. "Not a Day Goes By" from Merrily We Roll Along is a good song to showcase your vibrato, because it has a lot of long notes.

snrdDbLAaa	Hello.  I think you have mitigated the difficulty of the villanelle in an interesting way, rendering each stanza as a variation on a theme, rather than attempting to write a more linear poem.  The gradual narrative strategy reminds me of your recent ghazal (which I have also read); I thought was a very pure interpretation of the form into English, because the couplets also brushed around the main idea quite gently as they progressed.        Here are a few thoughts on your changes.    s1: I prefer features to complexity because it is more specific, while complexity adds no new information.  s2: Safe in is a great improvement over within   s4: Deep in is likewise an improvement over within; I also find villanelles too wooden without such variation.  The Dylan Thomas poem is among the few that succeed without it; but his is rhetorically and conceptually very simple.  I also agree that the shift to the present tense (became -> becomes) is helpful.  s5: Pride is an excellent capstone to this poem because it is the only `internal' description of the poem's subject.    I found another commentator's comparison to the Tyger to be curiously relevant; both poems, I think, are obscurely evocative.  I personally find the substitution of dare for could a partial artistic blemish in that poem, but `protecting her pride' is a good answer to this parallel.  A difference is that your poem is not dominated by the speaker's personality and wonder, as the Tyger is; I think this is fitting the private tone of the poem, and ultimately the poet's respectful attitiude is as clearly conveyed.    The inconsistent verb tense (`kept blowing,' `lived there forever,' versus the present tenses) is not too bad; the poem's ambivalence to a strict view of time is reflected in some of its ambivalencies to grammar.  Less pleasing are some of the choices about when to omit the definite article; `tone of the forest becomes derisive' grated somewhat, and `in attempt to be somewhat delusive' moreso, it partly because the construction is uncharacteristically garrulous.    I took some pleasure in reading this poem; thank you for sharing it.    (Forgive me if as a side note, I have trouble not remarking on ottava rima (the third poem of yours which I read).  I think you had trouble wit the couplets because the verbal bite at the conclusion of each stanza is typically used to emphasise the artificiality of the narration (cf. in Byron, of course), bringing the poet obtrusively to the reader's attention.  Therefore, I think it is, if not unsuited, at least a very difficult fit for that poem's stream-of-consciousness voice.)|`|IvrZyjrPaa	I will not even try to comment on your poem in the way Hypo...did, but to say that this Villanella has much improved on your first entry. I do not profess to know the reason why such styles of poetry are written, certainly not for the pleasure of the common man. But they do demand a certain amount of intelligence enabling the reader to stimulate their brain so that some acceptable answer may be given.  I did not even know what style a Villanella was until I looked the word up. This added some light to your poem to which I tried to give a reasonable intelligent comment.  So with all of that blathering over and done with I say that this is an improvement on your first entry. I will admit that my attention is always drawn to the last words of each line which is somewhat off putting. This however does not diminish the excellence of the work.    Robert|`|dS3XHvaoaa	Beautiful as always...|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I don't know what you have changed.  I looked at the other, but can only see, becomes/e'en, so I'm no help other than to say that this is as lovely yesterday.|`|JOChNigNaa	I do  not know that in changing the modifiers in the repeated lines that you have conformed to structure for a villanelle, but your flow and expression are beautiful  and show improvement over the first which did conform, but didn't build a coherent picture as this does.  I somehow see the elusive Mother Nature in the now, under constant pursuit and maltreatment in our present day.  Contradictory forces are at play.

Pq8gQsl2aa	I definitely don't agree with the part about it being boring. Authors write because they love to and love what they do. They WANT to write for 8 hours a day. They enjoy it, that's why they do it. If you don't want to put in the work then why even bother? You'll get no where.|`|DCjyVQGJaa	Everyone gets board at some point with their job, or sometimes its just not possibly to work that much. but at the very least you should e doing one hour a day, or 6 hours a week, so you don't lose the flow. good luck.

tKFO3u60aa	it's dancer.<br>  seeing as they are a band, and bands are generally involved in music, and people tend to dance to music, 'dancer' makes much more sense than 'denser'. also, i believe that is how they published the lyrics. of course, it could all be a giant conspiracy to subliminally divert the minds of our generation so we turn into a race of self deprecating people. however, i like The Killers too much to think that about them. <br>  :) lol|`|yuuvBSKsaa	lol.<br>  <br>  If you think it's denser....you are denser.<br>  <br>  I hope you dance.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTQfERb9HVk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTQfERb9H...</a>|`|B8cLlmI4aa	im pretty sure its denser.<br>  <br>  dancer doesnt really make any sense...|`|OFQoL7H9aa	it makes more sense with denser, but this lyrics sight metrolyrics.com says it's dancer|`|bMk6xZaSaa	dancer.

"Are we human, or are we purveyors of vaguely portentous-sounding lyrics".  This is how pop lyrics often work - they are deliberately vague with important sounding phrases so that people can read anything into them they like.
FLAtdWrmaa	There's nothing wrong with a single-word title, especially one that's so broad that just about any designs you can think up would fit the title.  About the only category you wouldn't want designs from would be children's-wear.  Oh, and maybe uniforms.<br>  <br>  But if you're just looking to try out other title ideas, here goes:<br>  <br>  "Passion On Edge"?<br>  <br>  "(color) Passion"?  ie:  Red Passion (talk about cliches), Black Passion, Bronze Passion, Hot Pink Passion, etc.<br>  <br>  "(thing) Passion" or "Passion of (thing)"? -- with the (thing) setting the tone for the collection  ie:  Play of Passion, Ice Passion, Iced Passion, Passion in Velvet, Fruit Passion, Fey Passion, Moonlight Passion (more cliches), Passion of the Wind, etc.  These aren't really great examples, just ideas to play with.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other design categories:<br>  Your scrapbook is Passion, but you don't have Lingerie?  :-D<br>  Swimwear <br>  Cruise-wear, vacation-wear<br>  Bridal & Special Occasion<br>  Evening wear<br>  Sportswear<br>  Athletic wear (Includes things like figure-skating & gymnastics wear, as well as team uniforms and bike shorts)<br>  Men's wear<br>  Outerwear<br>  Wearable Art<br>  Dance wear<br>  <br>  Give yourself a break, and specify the categories.  Two of your three are much too general.<br>  <br>  Break up the Accessories category -- there are whole industries devoted to just shoes -- just hats -- just handbags -- just special-occasion accessories, such as gloves, ties, ceremonial things (think graduation stuff)<br>  <br>  Everyday Wear is also too broad a category.  Usually, the industry refers to the clothes we relax in (hanging around the house, going shopping, visiting friends) as Sportswear. This includes casual pants, shorts, sundresses, casual dresses, sweater-knits (cardigans, vests, and pullovers), light shirts, dressier T-shirts, etc.<br>  <br>  Other everyday wear these days, though, includes work clothes for a huge variety of job types, from business suits to better dresses for professionals to workmen's one-pieces or sturdy pants and shirts, and so on.<br>  <br>  Fashion categories are also divided according to what their intended uses or occasions are, not what the garments are made of.  So, your line of metallic dresses might actually cover several categories, such as evening wear, casual wear (maybe even sportswear), and cruise-wear.  Or all of your metallic dresses might be only one part of a single, larger category, such as evening wear, which has other designs in it as well.<br>  <br>  BTW, you might impress your teacher by knowing that the industry term for the finished design sketches you display (and which your company might even work from to actually make the garment) are called "croquis"  (each one is a "croquie") -- pronounced CRO-kees.<br>  <br>  And a collection of your own designs gathered into a single group is your portfolio. <br>  <br>  A collection of inspirational motifs and designs which you collect together into one book, some of them imperfect or incomplete designs of your own, some of them pictures you've collected from elsewhere, is also a portfolio, but not *your* portfolio -- unless you want to call it your working portfolio (implying that the things in it aren't meant to be publicly displayed by you).  <br>  <br>  A collection of ideas you've collected from all over, not your own designs, is called your reference library or design library.  If you want to pursue fashion design as a career, start building your design library now, and don't fill it only with school in mind.  A designer's own design library is a very personal thing, and working designers always keep adding to theirs.<br>  <br>  And a related group of designs is called a "line" -- and the relationship can be anything:  the Winter 2009 line, the Metallic Dress line, the swimwear line, the Spandex line, etc.  A company or designer might have several "lines" within a single season, or a "line" of similar designs that change every season, but they carry designs in that line for several years, or they may want a specialty "line," such as the metallic dresses.<br>  <br>  This got very long.  Hmmm. Oh, well, it's probably waaay more than you even wanted, but I'll post it all, now, and hope it helps you out a bit.  Good luck, and have fun!|`|37481c754fce479d3f9f7da4eba53beaaa	i think "passion" sounds a little cliche. like there's a saying "a passion for fashion".<br>  why don't you use deviant. or something with that word in it. because its a little beyond what you had before. or synonyms like twist(ed) or sporadic or anomaly is better.<br>  i don't know. just use something different to stand out more.

lVAe2SLXaa	Science can adapt and change as facts appear. Your definition is a fallacy, and science is based on factual information and not on blind faith. You should study the science of psychology where the emotions are covered very well, thank you.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	It isn't, the very notion of science is an open mind, only believing in what one can prove, but always admitting that you may never truly know if your right about anything.    P.S. most great scientists are also very religious, including Einstein and Hawkin|`|AA11635601	Nope, you have these ideas all wadded up like a shirt in a washing machine.  First of all science does not require that it prove itself false.  It requires that it's proposals be falsifiable IF THEY ARE FALSE.  If they are true, they won't be found to be false.    Second, emotion is certainly acknowledged by science.  It would be foolish and contrary to what we observe to deny emotion.  That would be unscientific.    To make your argument, which is incorrect in my opinion, more convincingly, you should specify "measurable by machine" as your criterion for a thing being scientific.  Then you could argue that if something can't be measured by a machine, such as emotion, then it is not recognized by science, and that would be a lot more convincing, although still wrong.    Anyway, what would you recommend instead of science?  Believe in whatever we dreamt last night?  Deny anything in reality you don't like?    Science is our ongoing attempt to keep track of what we really do know and what really is true, in the storm of BS that blows around us daily.  Abandon it, and shortly you'll know nothing.|`|d265DZbHaa	Science does explain emotions. You obviously have not read anything on psychology    As to why science has the final word, it is because it is fact and they override guesses and superstition.|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	Science cannot take itself as the final word otherwise we'd still be the center of the solar system if not the universe.  However, if the provisional truths of science take a long time to change then people will tend to fall back on those conclusions. Especially since science has bribed people with all its goodies; from television, to microwaves to advances in medicines that have kept a few of my friends and relatives alive.|`|cxDbdhELaa	The fact that underlying "science" is dynamic flexibility, not dogma.|`|4XlWLeSsaa	science is the pursuit of answers...but if the question is faulty so is the answer....P.H|`|8UP6iQ5Zaa	What makes science the final word for so many is because we are a people who seek after a sign. If we cannot see and perceive and process and intellectualize it, it is not reality, and therefore has no substance. I find it amazing that the things that are the most valuable (even to the die-hard "show me's") is that which cannot be seen or physically touched. Like friendship, and love, and trust....etc.|`|AUoWzwNraa	There is a community of scientist that accept a new word or knowledge.  If it was already accepted they had the scientific procedure to market and expose this knowledge for useful living of the people. and it become part of the culture and belief of the people.  It will be updated or change when somebody had brought to those scientist community validated evidence from the current IMPERIAL data.  Science evolve when people change their pattern and it become a phenomena.

First of all the line starting with If should be connected not separated from the line starting with to, because their part of the same thought, and not part of the same thought of the other line in the second group, and more with each other than in the beginning of the first grouping.    The word blind is far too vague of a connection to what youre writing about earlier.    The ... at the end should be gotten rid of.    Their are all around better analogies, and structure you could use, and you should either be far broader or far more concise.|`|BzMQejGxaa	blurry and hurry don't rhyme.|`|DSgmbkgeaa	delete all of it, leave it blank|`|5zsPHQKwaa	I think you could add some more to it, as I think it has potential to be more lengthy and deeper :)|`|199TdYlvaa	I agree with Zaid.

ErGQOhjqaa	I'm not sure you can, or need, to improve it.  I'm no expert, but I know what I like, and I like your poem.  It tells a story that I have struggled with many times, so I relate to it.  I suspect many others will also.  I'd say get it down on paper for posterity, and keep writing!|`|Sxlcyua5aa	The poem is great.   If you take out the word "But"  in the verse "But every word I write, sounds all wrong"   Makes it flow better.   You can leave it if you like.   There is nothing wrong with it.   I just feel that if you take that one word out and leave the rest in that line then it flows better.   Nice job.|`|d8h5h8IVaa	Most prolific poets don't write poems that rhyme.  It's very difficult to write a poem that rhymes without it sounding juvenile.  My suggestion would be to go online and look at poems written by great poets, this site lists some: http://www.xs4all.nl/~pwessel/writers.ht...    Another suggestion is to write something that has your "voice," in it, not just what you think people want, because it comes off artificial and silly when people read a poem like this.  People want emotion and imagery when they read a poem, this poem offers no imagery whatsoever.  I think you should start over and write something else, something more evocative, remember to add imagery, people want to be able to see, hear, and smell what you write.    For example:    Her hair dripped  golden dust  across the city's  grey and sallow  sea of   drowned and  determined.    People want fantasy and alliteration, they want to be enchanted and intrigued, they want to feel.    Good luck.|`|blbV8NKMaa	2nd line -  maybe say "All I write, sounds all wrong" b/c it sounds kind of long w/ the 1st line (just an idea)     IDK its really good.    Were you trying to write about not being able to think or you actually could not think and wrote that?
YxEwDCquaa	i really like the book. i hate it that the 'emos' are trying to go overboard on it though. i really hope it doesn't end up in one of those categories. It so much better than harry potter because it is believable. In a way you think "Wow this could actually be happening in the world" which is so much better than a secret wizard school and people flying on broomsticks. Ive read all of the books around four times now ha ha. <br>  It's a shame that Stephenie Meyer doesn't know if she will carry on writing 'Midnight Sun' cos some idiots put it on the internet.

yOK32PM9aa	All we can say is that you kill yourself.  If you are asking questions about the afterlife, we have no more evidence in the case of suicide than we do for any other death.

When someone commits suicide he basically leaves his body like every one else at the time of death.  However he does not get another material body immediately like everyone else but he stays in a ghostly condition ( which is not so pleasant because he wants to do things but he does not have the material body to do it.  For instance he wants to taste but he does not have a tongue and so on....) until the real time for his old body is finished.  However, there is a way to end the cycle of birth in to material world and death and rebirth....altogether and achieve liberation.|`|7aK81hsbaa	you go to heaven, paradise, valhalla, nirvana, xanadu along with every other soul. god/dess never judges, hence no sin,  no hell, devil, or other boogiemen. god/dess is love and therefor so are we for we are her creations. all his creations are perfect. love is eternal and we are love. here in space/time however,  there are consequences to every action.|`|tKFO3u60aa	I have to say, Burning Gold Memories's answer made me smile a little, just because it was funny. As for the people who say, 'you die and we don't know any more than that,' well, duh. It's what you think, not what you know. It's about opinion, not evidence. Cee T, if you're going to get your grammar half correct, you might as well get it all correct. 'Their' does not modify 'a person'. <br>  sorry if i'm being a complete b*tch:(<br>  <br>  i think that we pass on, like everybody else, not really with any marks against us for our bad decisions and mistakes. it's more about our mindset, and how well we function under conditions and stresses. For example, many suicides are depressed people. depression takes their minds and contorts every possible nuance into a paranoia web of hatred and distrust. they are not in full possession of their senses, and to damn them for eternity because of it doesn't make sense.|`|AA11489001	ADDED after reading the answers here.. do NONE of you CARE what you would do to the people YOU left behind.

AND, if god is all, then he is also the burrito and would be eating himself and turning himself into himself and himself would be "Burritohood".and we would have to worship burritos,, and if he made us in his image then we would all be burritos; and if we were all burritos who would be playing the Salsa music? cause we all know that burritos can play guitars.|`|reeZXp4Maa	heck yeah! if god were to microwave a burrito past its normal thermal energy (cant say "heat" sgro would keelhaul me) capacity it would explode, therefor become uneatable; even to god.|`|F5bT2wAraa	What makes you perceive the concept of too hot is GOD.

6SwaWSoyaa	I had this same issue about a week ago and I realized that I needed to get an inexpensive decent mic and a camcorder. Digital cameras and phones have awful mics built in them and they distort your voice. Also they distort somewhat the sound of instruments in case you try to play something at the same time. Go to Target or Best Buy and get something that you can trust, you know that will last, but won't be expensive. Cameras in the Canon series are good and while you are at it ask about the mics.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Phones and digital cameras are not made for creating fine reproductions of the human voice.  You need a real microphone and some way to record yourself.|`|pgn2eSpwaa	phones and DIgital cams are notoriously bad recoding Devices for audio, since they have no external microphone<br>  if you want to post audio files, get a remote mic or find a laptop with a good self-contained mic in the webcam or something like that<br>  just like in all music, the instrument you use determines the quality of sound<br>  a great violin produces crisp sound, while an old rough fiddle plays the same song, just not a pretty a result<br>  <br>  get a quality mic and your sound will be accurately recorded|`|W1h3w5gdaa	The "best" way would be to get into a multi-million dollar recording studio with the top-notch engineers and producers of the world. <br>  <br>  Assuming this is outside your abilities and you're looking for an affordable way to do it, then I'd recommend getting some cheap recording software, a $10 computer microphone, and record yourself to the PC.

502de2cc3792d16d3d9fb9314dac8743aa	From your description, it doesn't sound like you're from the U.S.    I am, though and i have studied acting at the university level.  It was a great experience...coming out of high school, you think you know things but most of the time, you know very little. Even once you graduate college, you'll still have a LOT to learn but it is necessary to have adequate preparation.    Best advice: Get very involved with the theatre dept but not so involved that you forget to enjoy the college experience in general and make other friends outside your major...|`|cLKkbPPoaa	um.... from people who i know that major in theater, what you do is read different plays and scrips and the anylize them and act them out|`|g4rDDsVwaa	You will likely be reading many, many plays.  You will also be studying theater history the first year (probably).  Expect your time to be filled with rehearsals for plays and monologues or dramatic scenes.  My experience was that I had plenty of time to get to know the other people in the Theater Department, but I had almost no time to socialize with folks doing other things.  For example, while everyone else was going out on the weekend, I spent time at rehearsals.    There are many interesting people you will meet while doing theater.  I found that it was a good thing, because I had very little time to spend outside of the theater.  If you have the passion for the work, you will probably love it.  If you are unsure, you will probably be tested and come out of your first year knowing whether or not this is for you.  Best of luck.

jTh0Vf7saa	Friends I have are into graffiti, I mentioned doing some of it myself and they told me it takes years to define a particular style so be prepared to do a lot of practise. They said that the best place to start is by thinking up a tag name that obviously isnt your own name. Get a pad of paper and do some scribbling before you go out there and spray, this is good practise too. They mentioned doing what's called a "throw-up" too, where you allocate yourself say a couple of minutes or even 30 seconds to do a quick piece on a wall. This is the best place to start. As far as meeting people who like graffiti, your best bet is to take art class with a bunch of teenagers, at least A few will be into it. Do graffiti in quiet empty areas but be prepared to pay a bit of a fine in the unlikely event that you are busted! It takes time to define a writing style and spray paint is by no means an easy medium for conveying your art. While it takes lots of practise to get into it, graffiti is one of the most pure forms of expression and dates back to tens of thousands of years ago, although not everyone agrees with this! Good luck buddy and watch out for the fuzz!!|`|cdwWaNkJaa	i got the same dream homie...hit me up and we cud tag 2gether or sumtn. we shud start a crew so we cud be famous where you live n where i live...dat wud be a start

9dd2ac44728dd565acf459d4a4e730d0aa	I like proper endings. I read Charlotte Bronte's "Villette" in a very old edition in the school library (so old that it was stated to be by "Currer Bell"!) from which someone had torn out the last few pages. I imagined the ending and some time later, when I came across a more modern edition, I read the contents of the missing pages. What a disappointment (it ended in grief)! Had it all been there in the first place, I could have come to terms with it.<br>  <br>  Life is unpredictable and perhaps that is why I like my books to say what happens in the end.
xU7AaQOdaa	Plot Summary<br>  Set during World War II, the story describes the plight of a group of British schoolboys stranded on a Pacific island after their plane was shot down en route to England. Two of the boys, Ralph and Piggy, discover a conch in the lagoon near the beach and use it to call all the other survivors, setting up a mock democratic government with Ralph as leader. Piggy continues to advise and give logic and reason to Ralph's rule. A signal fire, kindled with the lens of Piggy's glasses, is established on the mountain to call passing ships to their rescue while shelters are constructed.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  However, the school's choir leader, Jack, soon becomes obsessed with hunting the pigs of the island and loses sight of Ralph's democratic vision. Further discord results with an increasing fear of a supposed "beast" on the island, stemming particularly from the younger boys dubbed the "littluns." Jack eventually abandons any thought of being rescued, content instead with hunting and killing pigs with his choir boys turned into hunters. Jack later speaks out of turn during their assembly meetings and eventually leaves the group to start a "tribe." Other children gradually defect to his side except for Ralph, Piggy, Simon and the twins Samneric (Sam and Eric). One by one these children are eliminated from the opposition.<br>  <br>  Upon discovering the beast the boys had all feared on the mountain is only the rotting corpse of a pilot whose plane had been shot down near the island, Simon runs down from the mountain to share this happy news. However the boys (including Ralph, Piggy, and Samneric) are all, following Jack's example, caught up in a primal ritual celebrating the murder of a pig they have just eaten and Simon runs into the midst of this. Mistaken to be the beast, Simon is killed by the boys' spears.<br>  <br>  Ralph, Piggy, and Samneric remain resistant to joining Jack's tribe. They attempt to cling to the democracy they had set up, still using the conch to call an assembly and struggling to keep a signal fire burning on the beach. Then Jack and his hunters attack the four and steal Piggy's glasses to kindle the fire he needs for pig-roasting fires. Angry and blinded, Piggy decides to go to the place on the island called Castle Rock where the hunters have set up a base. Reluctantly, Ralph and Samneric agree and upon arriving Roger stops them at the gate. Jack emerges from the forest and begins to fight with Ralph while Piggy stands nearby shrieking in fear, wanting only for his sight be restored by retrieving his glasses. Samneric are seized at Jack's command by the hunters and Roger, Jack's second-in-command, drops a large boulder on the head of Piggy, killing him and shattering the conch which he holds in his hands. Ralph alone is left to flee, with no friends left to aid him. Samneric have become hunters as well and betray the secret of his hiding place in the forest to Jack. The island is set ablaze and hunters fan out to kill Ralph with their spears, the sole remaining opposition to their tribe, as even now he tries to cling to his old democratic ideas.<br>  <br>  Running wildly and suddenly becoming savage himself, Ralph stabs with his spear at the hunters pursuing him, chased by all until he at last comes to the beach. The shelters he had built with such labor are in flames and, falling at last upon the sand with the sea before him and nowhere left to run, Ralph looks up to see a naval officer. Rescue comes at last to the boys' aid, seeing the smoke from the mighty blaze set by Jack's hunters after Ralph's signal fire had earlier failed to alert anyone of their presence. When the officer expresses disapproval for the savage state and chaos to which the boys have reverted, Ralph breaks down in tears. Soon, all the hunters begin crying at the sight of grown-ups on the beach. Ralph weeps for "the end of innocence" and "the darkness of man's heart."<br>  <br>  Now look at the link below for more detail and character analysis.|`|SYKGIiQkaa	Go to Wikipedia and type it in.

EXQzhRBjaa	The apple on the cover of Twilight represents "forbidden fruit." I used the scripture from Genesis (located just after the table of contents) because I loved the phrase "the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." Isn't this exactly what Bella ends up with? A working knowledge of what good is, and what evil is. The nice thing about the apple is it has so many symbolic roots. You've got the apple in Snow White, one bite and you're frozen forever in a state of not-quite-death... Then you have Paris and the golden apple in Greek mythology—look how much trouble that started. Apples are quite the versatile fruit. In the end, I love the beautiful simplicity of the picture.

I read the Sookie Stackhouse books (Southern Vampire Mysteries I think the series is called) and they were ok, but a little smutty and indulgent.

Criticism will hurt if people say it about you or about a false persona. <br>  <br>  Most authors do not use pen names and those that do often have a reason for doing so (their non-writing work could be negatively affected by their book - such as a detective who writes crime fiction as a hobby; to prove a point - King wrote under the name Bachman when people said King's work had become stale; or to remain anonymous and avoid fame, not to avoid criticism, which will find you regardless). <br>  <br>  And the name Mystic...it is a little too made-up. It's what you name a My Pretty Pony doll, not an author. You want a name people respond positively to and the honest truth is "Mystic" is not a name I'd see and think "Man, I want to read a book written by a girl named Mystic!" sorry, but that's the truth.|`|Pq8gQsl2aa	Changing your name is not going to stop people from saying bad things about your book, it's still going to hurt.

It is when you start to use more water, painting wet in wet, or with a lot of washes that painting on a block (unless it is of 300 lb paper) that the paper can start to buckle,. Many people think that the paper on a Block is stretched (to its maximum size and thus will not warp)_ this is not true. It is necessary to open up or "release" at least three sides when painting on a block, in order to help alleviate the buckling that will come from painting in a wet approach on the paper while it is bound. If you use 300 lb paper in a block this will not happen. If you use 90 lb or 140 it will.<br>  <br>  As with any art, you are best to buy the better materials right from the start. "Artist grade" paper is always a better choice to work on.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped answer your question.<br>  <br>  Robin Miltner<br>  Educational Art Director<br>  <a href="http://www.snca.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.snca.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.robinmiltner.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.robinmiltner.com</a>|`|EyL6Pic3aa	Quality water color paper usually comes in large single sheets, and needs to be stretched before you paint on it. Stretching your paper involves, first soaking it in water. Then either taping, or stapling it to a board. This keeps the paper from warping when you paint on it. When your painting is finished you simply cut it free from the board. <br>  <br>  Water color pads are just like drawing pads, but with inexpensive, and light weight water color paper. They're really better for doing charcoal drawings on than painting.<br>  <br>  Water color blocks are kind of like a pad, but usually made of better paper, and they're bound all the way around with wax. Blocks are typically used when you want to work on smaller pieces. There is no need to stretch paper from a block. The wax binding will keep everything in place, and keep your paper from warping. You just paint directly on the top sheet. When you're finished, separate the top sheet from the block by inserting an X-acto knife between the sheets, and run it all the way around the block.|`|AA11868652	paper is the sheets of paper, a pad is like any pad - sheets glued or wiered together, and a block is usually the same as a pad... sometimes there is more paper in a block, hence its name.|`|413ee09d955875dba8ae05421b67f00daa	Agreed with Ninde, watercolor paper is water , pad is smaller and few pieces easy to carry any where, block is larger and more pieces glue together, but watercolor paper usually is a large sheet of paper, many type and thickness, and material, and only the artist use them because it is very expensive, for good watercolor painting you should use paper 180-200 gsm. Good luck.
7ONKVbbiaa	Ancestry.com will have no info concerning coats of arms, for the simple reason that they KNOW it is not a valid part of genealogy. Houseofnames is fairly well known with the regulars here, for just the opposite.. they know it isn't, but they want to sell you something that is a basic rip off. <br>  Coats of arms DO NOT belong to "families".

These were issued to INDIVIDUAL PERSONS, and only go to the direct heir.  <br>  There are decent sources on the topic of heraldry, and the one you mention is most likely included somewhere.

rT22hTL0aa	I don't make fanvids, but I am an amateur movie producer.  I can relate to the problem of friends not wanting to put in the work.  Organizing all of that is part of being a movie director.  I tend to write scripts (I'm also a writer) with only a few human characters to limit the problems with friends who aren't interested in putting in work on a project they are not getting paid for (and you have to face that fact, they don't always share your vision and enthusiasm and don't want give up their time for free).  I often use imaginary creatures (still animations and 3D computer models) to fill in some more characters.  My movies are very low budget.  I spent money only on equipment (movie software, camera, and some props) - you can watch some on youtube...  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/earthshinemusic4u" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/earthshinemu...</a> (my feature length movie "Intergalactic Archeology is there -- though it's divided up into 8 parts).  I start with a script (which I usually write).  I write it keeping in mind what I am capable of producing with what I have.  I then find "friends" to help with any characters needed (and we often play more than one character).  Then, of course, the hard part is getting people together to film, but remember a movie isn't usually filmed all at once or even in order.  Try to arrange a shoot schedule around your friends schedules and try to do all the scenes that the friend is in all together (even if it's scene 2, 5, and 20 -- you don't have to do them in order!)   Then I design and animate fictional characters.  I use a digital still camera to take pictures of a model (often made out of Legos, to tell the truth) and then run the pictures together in a super fast slide show on the computer to make the animation. I do 3D models on a free program called anim8or...  <a href="http://www.anim8or.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.anim8or.com</a>     I only ask my friends to do filming, I do all the tedious editing myself.   I use Pinnacle Studio 11plus(with the "ultimate upgrade") for my final editing which allows me to do blue/green screen effect (where you film in front of a blue or green screen and then remove the screen on the computer and put whatever background you want behind it).   My blue and green screens are pieces of cloth I bought at a craft store (you need lots of light to make them work right).  I also use a free photoshop-like program called The Gimp for special effects <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/</a>  and I have access to a powerful special effects program (thanks to my work with "The Virginia Film Co." called "Adobe After Effects (it's about an $800 program).  <br>      For filming I use a Digital Camcorder with a built in hard drive, and so I can upload the movies directly to the computer for editing.
dNl2ooz7aa	None of the listed choices are adequate. The first two are exactly backwards. The latter two are misleading, because Genghis was the unique leader of the Mongols who had forced unification of the tribes/families of the steppes.      It would be Genghis's death that stopped the Mongol generals from overrunning all of Europe, because they had to return home to resolve the leadership issue.     The reason? Genghis's death. His successors did govern well, and for one example, the great medieval Indian dynasty was founded by the Mongels, and ruled the land for centuries, until the Europeans arrived with thier armies.|`|AA10729675	They were better at war than government.

644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	At the beginning of WW2, Morocco, Algeria, & Tunisia were French colonies, Libya was an Italian colony and Egypt was a British Protectorate (a de facto colony).    LIBYA: A number of major battles took place in Libya during the North African campaign of World War II. In September 1940, the Italian invasion of Egypt was launched from Libya. Starting in December of the same year, the British launched a counterattack called Operation Compass and the Italian forces were pushed back into Libya. After losing all of Cyrenaica and almost all of its Tenth Army, Italy asked for German assistance to aide the failing North African Campaign.    With German support, the lost Libyan territory was regained and by the conclusion of Operation Brevity, German and Italian forces were entering Egypt. The Siege of Tobruk in April 1941, where German General Erwin Rommel's forces were defeated, marked the first failure of Blitzkrieg tactics. Defeat during the Second Battle of El Alamein in Egypt spelled the doom of the Axis forces in Libya and meant the end of the Western Desert Campaign.    In February 1943, retreating German and Italian forces were forced to abandon Libya as they were pushed out of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, thus ending Italian jurisdiction and control over Libya.     USA: When it became evident by mid-1942 that there could be no cross-channel attack in September, American planners acceded to a plan the British had been urging. This was to use the means that would be accumulated in England by the fall of 1942, plus additional forces from the United States, to invade North Africa, where, it was hoped, French forces might lend support to the operation.    The primary objective was to utilize ready Allied forces in an operation commensurate with current capabilities to relieve pressure on the Russians. Other objectives of the operation were to gain French Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia as a base for enlisting the French colonial empire in the war, to assist the British in destroying Axis forces threatening Egypt and Suez, to open the Mediterranean to Allied shipping, to shorten the route to the Far East, and to prepare the way for further operations against the European Axis. The Combined Chiefs of Staff ratified the plan and named General Eisenhower as commander in chief of the Allied Expeditionary Force that was to invade North Africa. Code name for this operation was Torch.     EGYPT: Although Egypt was technically neutral, Cairo soon became a major military base for the British forces leading up to World War II. This was because of a 1936 treaty by which the United Kingdom maintained that it had the right to station troops on Egyptian soil in order to protect the Suez Canal.    At that time Egypt was ruled by King Farouk I, who had ascended the throne in 1936 and would remain in power until 1952. During the hardships of World War II, criticism was leveled at Farouk for his lavish lifestyle. His decision to keep all the lights burning at his palace in Alexandria, during a time when the city was under blackout due to Italian bombing, particularly angered some. The royal Italian servants of Farouk were not interned and there is an unconfirmed story that Farouk had told Sir Miles Lampson, "I'll get rid of my Italians, when you get rid of yours." This remark was a reference to the ambassador's Italian wife.    After the war, King Farouk brought large numbers of German military and intelligence personnel and ranking ex-Nazis to Egypt as "advisors". The Germans realized Farouk's political weakness and began conspiring with Nasser and the Free Officers Movement who were also working closely with the Muslim Brotherhood, to overthrow Farouk, which finally happened in 1952. This move infuriated the British, who had been training and assisting the Egyptian Army since the creation of the Kingdom of Egypt in 1922. In 1943, the British Army surrounded the Abdeen Palace and threatened to overthrow the government after there were reports that King Farouk openly supported the German Army.

There were units formed from British colonies such as Sudan and Egypt but they were small in numbers, not especially well armed and served mostly as guides, scouts and such. However at least as many Northern Africans aided the Germans under the premise that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.     Colonial armies in North Africa melted away the second Germans appeared. What few actually stood and fought lacked air power, armor and  heavy artillary. As such they were badly overmatched, their numbers small and their economies unindustrialized. There were no significant guerilla efforts. In fact guerilla efforts organized against the French and British often aided the Germans either intentionally or by taking advantage of the German prescence to strike out against those they felt aided the French and British.

Technique meaning using voice variation, movement, visual and vocal technique and using your intent on stage. Always having an objective. "Playing an emotion" is not believable and is boring. Good trick when acting: your character always has a secret. It provides more possible objectives toward other characters.

Also peoples form all across the country moved there when it opened up.    I'm not sure how much of that helps over the last 50-yrs. I would assume it would be related to people form the NE and other sections of the country moving there.    If this is for an assignment I would guess that your teacher has a very narrow focus and is looking for a very specific answer would need to be in the class, or know him, to know what it is.    Such teachers are usually convinced that their answer is the only possible correct answer, and will use whatever breadcrumbs they've left you as evidence of that; in H.S. and College I had teachers like that and can tell you beating themin a debate over this and proving them wrong in this assumption- or even proving your answer was better than theirs- will only make things worse for you for the rest of your class and won't even get you your way, so I would suggest that you go to the teacher or go over your notes on his classes and reread the material for those breadcrumbs

The justices never make any references to the Constitution per se, but to previous law, including both the Selective Service Act and to previous opinions. You can read the opinion at the link. You'll have to trace the previous opinions if you wish to find a Constitutional link.     Note that Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power to raise an army and navy, so I assume the Selective Slavery Act falls under this section.

4b5IQWcFaa	Robert A. Heinlein's Tunnel in the Sky, published in 1955, can be seen as a rebuttal to Lord of the Flies as it concerns a group of teenagers stranded on an uninhabited planet who manage to create a functional tribal society.[7]    Stephen King has stated that the Castle Rock in Lord of the Flies was the inspiration for the town of the same name that has appeared in a number of his novels. The book itself also appears prominently in his novels Hearts in Atlantis and Cujo.[8] King's fictional town in turn inspired the name of Rob Reiner's production company, Castle Rock Entertainment.    The young adult novel Gone, by Michael Grant, is closely related, with all of the adults and teens above 14 disappearing, leaving the rest to fend for and attempt to govern themselves.  Lord of the Flies inspired Sunrise Animation's classic anime series Infinite Ryvius, which follows the lives of nearly 500 teenagers stranded aboard a space battleship.    Also the "Das Bus" episode of The Simpsons is based on this book. The episode Kamp Krusty also has several elements from Lord of the Flies as well (a pig's head on a spear, kids using primitive weapons and wearing war paint and a burning effigy).    The ABC television show Lost has also shown loose similarities to the book.    The South Park episode The Wacky Molestation Adventure parodies Lord of the Flies, in which Eric Cartman represents Ralph, while Stan Marsh and Kyle Broflovski both represent Jack. In a twist of irony, the civilised tribe in the episode (Cartman's tribe) is more evil than the savage tribe. Kenny McCormick may have represented Simon, since he was killed because he was seen dead by the two adults.  The English heavy metal band Iron Maiden composed a song about the novel, with the title "Lord of the Flies".   The American hard rock band Aerosmith composed a song about a pimp and his stable of women, with the title "Lord of the Thighs" which was a take off and play on Lord of the Flies.   The debut studio album, Boy, by Irish rock band U2 was loosely based on the novel's theme of childhood corruption, and the final song on the album, "Shadows and Tall Trees," takes its title from the novel's chapter of the same name. Additionally, some printings of the book's cover are similar to the cover of the album.[9]   American punk rock band Bad Religion referenced the novel in the song "1000 More Fools", from their 1988 album Suffer: "I've seen the rapture in a starving baby's eyes, Inchoate beatitude, the Lord of the Flies".   American punk rock group The Offspring referenced the title of the book on their song "You're Gonna Go Far, Kid" off their latest studio effort, Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace|`|6GdeuiCgaa	I did some cool stuff with the face-painting chapter earlier this year. What does a person's face mean, and what is the significance of covering the face? When Jack & the hunters do it, it allows a certain savage part of their personalities to emerge.    I used examples of the rock band KISS (painted faces & stage personas vs. un-painted faces in the '80s), pro wrestlers (specifically, the Road Warriors from '80s/'90s), and African & South Pacific warriors.    My most successful example was Batman/Bruce Wayne. The students really liked that because "The Dark Knight" came out over the summer.    EDIT: I also used that Iron Maiden during the unit; it went rather well, too.|`|zuZntfiwaa	Well, since you already have a song and a show, I see that some of the answers you've received are, though well-meaning, unfortunately not helpful.    You could take a look at the political struggle going on in Zimbabwe between Robert Mugabe and his democratically elected challenger, who Mugabe refused to give up power to. They only recently reached a rapprochement of sorts, but the situation in the country is still horrible, with inflation running rampant and internecine conflicts/murders....    The mother who set up a MySpace account expressly for bullying one of her daughter's classmates, a girl who subsequently killed herself, was sentenced within the past couple of months. There's also been a lot of controversy over the high schoolers who get into fights, video them, and then post them on the Internet. (One case recently was particularly heinous; a girl was invited over to one of her "friend's" homes, where she was pummeled over and over, punched in the face, etc.---and the whole thing was recorded and put online, where the brazenly displayed evidence helped put several of the girls away for a number of years....I think they were tried as adults....)    Thailand also went through massive political turmoil recently.... Myanmar, too, about a year ago....China has been having to quell rebellions in the countryside for the past 18 months or so....     The actions of Blackwater (and other private contractors, such as KBR/Halliburton) in Iraq and New Orleans during the chaos in those places have been extremely violent and devastating for civil liberties and the reputation of the U.S.      Maybe a contrast between the Bush administration's increasingly hostile stance toward Iran vs. Obama's coming into office and bringing more "sanity" and a more "civilized posture" toward Iran (and torture and Gitmo and such) could be compared to the very end of the novel....    All the events surrounding the ouster of Pervez Musharraf as dictator of Pakistan to the election of Bhutto's husband (thoroughly corrupt as he is, though) might be good, esp. since Bhutto was assassinated before she would have been elected and another former prime minister (the one overthrown by Musharraf) was also a contender for     An American citizen of Latin American descent was beaten to death by a group of teens (in Ohio? Pennsylvania? Indiana?) sometime last year because they thought he was an illegal immigrant. A couple of similar incidents have happened within the past 6 to 12 months, too. And several people who were perceived to be Arab or Muslim were killed right after 9/11 by individuals or groups who lashed out at them b/c of the hijackers. (I remember one was a Sikh, therefore of course NOT Muslim OR Arab.)     Then there was that transit system cop who, just a week or two ago, killed a suspect who was already face down on the floor and handcuffed.....     Or there are the times when a sports team wins a championship and the fans go on a gleeful rampage through the streets, turning over cars and burning them, smashing windows and looting stores, etc.     Good luck....

If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken  Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,  Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,  And stoop and build'em up with worn-out tools;    If you can make one heap of all your winnings  And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,  And lose, and start again at your beginnings,  And never breathe a word about your loss:  If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew  To serve your turn long after they are gone,  And so hold on when there is nothing in you  Except the Will which says to them: "Hold on!"    If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,  Or walk with Kings---nor lose the common touch,  If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,  If all men count with you, but none too much:  If you can fill the unforgiving minute  With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,  Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,  And---which is more---you'll be a Man, my son!     *****  ......or is it this one......    *****  If  by E.E.

If earth was heaven, and now was hence,  And past was present, and false was true,  There might be some sense       But I'd be in suspense  For on such a pretense  You wouldn't be you.    If fear was plucky, and globes were square,  And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee  Things would seem fair,-  Yet they'd all despair,  For if here was there  We wouldn't be we.     *****|`|n9hRyHpqaa	Janet Waking    Beautifully Janet slept  Till it was deeply morning. She woke then  And thought about her dainty-feathered hen,  To see how it had kept.    One kiss she gave to her mother.  Only a small one gave she to her daddy  Who would have kissed each curl of his shining baby;  No kiss at all for her brother.    "Old Chucky, old Chucky!" she cried,  Running across the world upon the grass  To Chucky's house, and listening. But alas,  Her Chucky had died.    It was a transmogrifying bee  Came droning down on Chucky's old bald head  And sat and put the poison. It scarely bled,  But how exceedingly    And purply did the knot  Swell with the venom and communicate  It's rigor! Now the poor comb stood up straight  But Chucky did not.    So there was Janet  Kneeling on the wet grass, crying her brown hen  (Translated far beyond the daughters of men)  To rise and walk upon it.    And weeping fast as she had breath  Janet implored us, "Wake her from her sleep!"  And would not be instructed in how deep  Was the forgetful kingdom of death.    -John Crowe Ransom|`|AA11510999	here is a website with poems about growing up|`|AA11226842	Natures First Green is Gold by Robert Frost|`|b42dde3b8bf259a89160959c1849c2b0aa	Apathy  When I grow up  I want to be just like Daddy  Wasting away as an empty slave  Who worked himself into  An all-American grave    When I grow up  I want to be just like Mommy  From a broken heart  To a broken home  As America tears her apart    When I grow up  I want to be just like Christ  Such a plastic martyr  To be sacrificed  To swallow this water    Then I grew up  And I lost myself  Such a hopeful boy  But after this  I became just another toy|`|YbwDFvEaaa	Check out the poetry of Shel Silverstein.
