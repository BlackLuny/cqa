20090205140839AA0xKLp	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Transferring ringtones to another verizon phone?	I have an old phone from last year that has about $60 worth of ringtones on it that I still want. The old phone is some LG blue camera flip phone, and my new one is the old model of the EnV.    Before when I got new phones, Verizon would just tell me to re-download the ringtones, call customer service letting them know it was a new phone and the money I paid to buy the ringtones would be credited to my account on my next bill. However I was told too many people we're trying to rip Verizon off by buying ringtones and claiming it was on an old phone, so they no longer did that and any ringtones I bought I would be charged for again and they wouldn't credit my account.      I called the local Verizon store asking what I could do, the sales associate wasn't helpful at all....she said if I had an SD card (which I do) I could just save ringtones to that and upload them to my new one however in my ringtones menu there is no option to save ringtones to another place.      Is there another way to get my ringtones from my old phone to my new one? I'd rather not spend anymore money than I already have, the point of spending $30 on a SD card was to trasnfer pictures and ringtones, and going into a Verizon store and having them do something is out of the question since I'm 8 months pregnant, can no longer fit behind the wheel and my husband is in the army and usually works until 7 at night (by that point he is 100% against going ANYWHERE, and he hates going anywhere on weekends).

Then, when i go to play a song from a CD, it won't play. If i finally do get it to play, then it plays that song and skips to song 12 then song 5 w/o playing them. It's really strange. Now it is just stuck after i synced it to my computer on the screen that says OK to disconnect. I can't even turn it off or anything.      Is there something I can do to fix it? Also, if i restore my iPod to it's original settings, will i lose all of my music/movies, etc. that are on my itunes, or will they just be gone from my iPod? and will i lose the stuff I downloaded from Itunes?

20090205145347AAe8pXQ	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	House Phone (cordless) questions..?	So, I've had this same phone for many a years, probably atleast 4 or 5.  Never had issues until a couple of months ago, when I came home, and started to make a call, and noticed that all the numbers stored in memory had been erased.  Also, all the previous calls had been deleted. The problem persisted to Not sending calls out correctly, as in, I would correctly enter the number, but, it would come up with an error tone. Or sometimes, it take it a few seconds to even dial.        I'm guessing its a bad battery, and, all I need to do is just go purchase a new phone, which is no big deal.      My question is... How long do cordless phone batteries last, when they are constantly sitting on the charger, day in and out?      Just for reference of the type of phone... its an old GE cordless phone.

20090205154049AAJBe8j	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Down-grading to broadcast TV  service; will we still need an antenna after the digital tv transition?	We currently have digital cable and an analog TV.  So I know we'll be fine after the digital TV switch, because we pay for service.    However, we're thinking of escaping from those cable bills and just going with broadcast instead (for free).  I know we will need a digital converter box, but here's my question -- do those boxes still work by connection to an antenna, or does the service come through the cable in the wall that our current cable TV comes through?      We live in an apartment block, so we can't put an antenna outside anywhere, as far as I know... Unless it's all there already and I just don't know about it.    Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I've never lived somewhere where we haven't paid for cable, so I don't know how broadcast works anyway, let alone now that it's going to be digital.  (I do know my boyfriend's family has broadcast, and they have an antenna on the roof that they adjust from time to time... Hence my question about whether that will still be necessary post-DTV switch.)    Thanks.

20090205132419AAOvJnU	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why does my ipod's battery last only 7 hours?	This last Christmas, I got a brand new shiny blue ipod nano (4th generation). I was thrilled at first, but as I began to use it, I realized that the batter lasts only about 7 hours, instead of the 24 hours advertised by apple. I only listen to music on it, and don't look at pictures or watch videos, so the back light is not turned on very often. Also, I only charge my ipod when it's completely dead, and I charge it for the required full 3 hours, or until the plug symbol appears. Does anyone else have this problem?     Did anyone try replacing their battery and how much does it cost? I am considering replacing mine; hopefully, it should be covered by warranty...
