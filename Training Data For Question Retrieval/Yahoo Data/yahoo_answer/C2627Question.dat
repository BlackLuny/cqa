About ten miles ago I put 1 qt rislone in the oil, that just made the lifter much louder. Few people have told me that rslone will actually thin the oil thus making it louder.       Does rislone thin the oil and will it make it louder?      How long should I continue to drive with the oil thinned before I change the oil again?      What wieght of oil should I put in, and should I also add lucas oil stabilser?      Will thicker oil and lucas quiet the valve, if not will it hurt the vehicle to drive it with a loud lifter?      How much would an average mechanic charge to repair this, and how many hours should the job take?

I had some work done to my car at my local dealership (warranty covered is the only reason it went to the dealership) and I asked them to clean my injectors and they said it would be $100.00 so I figured that they would actually clean them by hand but when I looked over the invoice I found out all they did was pour a $20.00 bottle of solution into the tank.

"HEI shielding - an open ground ckt 453 may result in EMI, will result in induced electrical "noise". The ECM looks at this noise as reference pulses. The additional pulses result in a higher than actual engine speed signal. The ECM then delivers too much fuel, causing the system to go rich. The engine tachometer will, also, show higher than actual engine speed, which can help in diagnosing this problem."   What does hei shielding mean? is that ignition? my old chevy has that with a dist.  But my car is DIS. so that doesn't apply to me right?  how should my fuel injector sound? it seems loud, but it has a good spray pattern and doesn't seem to leak. my car is an 88 chevy celebrtiy with the 2.5fi.

20090129115215AAMOyTs	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How common is a missing cabin air filter?  Is the shop ripping me off?	I went in for an oil change as I have several times before. Sat in the waiting room eating some fast food, the technician comes in and holds a dirty air filter directly over our food, showing me it needs to be replaced.  He then takes me out to my car and shows me my glove box and neighboring parts torn apart and lying in the foot well.  Explains that they checked the cabin air filter and it wasn't even there!  They recommend replacing it at a cost of $35, because of the labor.  Not a huge cost, I almost did it, until I started wondering why they seemed suspicious to me.       Before servicing the car, they never even mentioned checking the cabin air filter or asked permission to open the glove box full of personal information, let alone tear half of the inside of the car apart.  Afterward, they went on a story about how they just started carrying the filters in stock, that one of their cars was missing a filter once, and tried to sell me on how they are important for people with asthma or babies, etc.  Of course, they had seen me unload our baby from the back seat earlier!  They asked if there had been any bad smells, etc.  I told them it has never been a problem and we just finished a long trip with the heater on the whole time.        I told them I could not pay $35 for a filter and would go to Autozone to get one and put it in myself.  Since leaving, there has been the burning oil smell they asked about.  Never smelled that before now!      The fact is, my wife bought the vehicle brand new 8 years ago and has been the only owner.  She has never had anyone check the cabin air filter and is sure it has never been serviced or replaced.  I’m quite confident they don’t sell this vehicle without the filter!  Is there any chance they really did just go to check it and it wasn’t there?!  Is that standard procedure for any other shops?  Should I report them to the BBB, online reviews, etc?

It'll switch gears later than it's supposed to, sometimes we even have to lift off the gas for a second to help it switch. Sometimes it won't even switch into 5th gear (but sometimes it does).

20090128114312AA1OLnD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Infiniti	Ok, so i want to buy a newer car something like a 2003 Infiniti G35. I know millage on a car makes a big ?	difference in price. For instance a 2003 with 30,000 miles might cost something like $17,000 but a 2003 with 99,000 might cost $9,000. Here's my question. Being that Infinit is a strong japanese car and most people will tell you it can easily hit 150,000 why would i care if it has 99,000 when i buy it? I only average 8,000 miles per year so even if i had the car for 4 years that would only put on about 32,000 which would leave me with a total of 131,000 if i decide to get rid of it then...I dont care about the miles or taking a loss when i sell it but does it really have any affect on the actual driving or condition of the car?

What?  a repair may not be possible, as this machine's motor is no longer made.  if we found a second hand motor, not knowing how well it works, repair prices in the capitol city where i live are often extremely high for electrical repairs.  i definitely wouldn't repair it if were mine. the repair person seemed certain that it wasn't my fault. but i think my friend is expecting some kind of reembursement from me.  i feel unlucky, as i didn't even finish the task i had borrowed the machine for, but willing to give some money, just to do what's right. in reality, i don't think i would ask for money for a 35 year old appliance that breaks down, in her shoes. but she says she only used it once a year and it worked fine. (the repair place said they had had one that worked fine and then just broke down from age-it just happens).        i new cheap machine would be about 150 euros and a repair possibly impossible and more expensive with second-hand motor.      what should i offer. i'm sure the friend will take whatever i offer. she is not a close friend and tends to be quite concerned about caring for her own welfare.  i don't want to be cheap or cheesy nor to give excessively either.

20090128120807AA9oGCq	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Question about Liability Insurance.?	My mother has insurance on a car I drive, but do to a horrible driving record State Farm - her car insurance company - won't carry me, and when they will again it won't be cheap. I recently found some cheap liability insurance but I was curious - the insurance companies won't give me a straight answer - does my mom have to switch all the insurance for the car, or can I have insurance just for when I drive. If so should I get PIP - personal injury protection instead of liability?      Pretty much can there be 2 forms of insurance from 2 seperate companies on one car? Full Coverage for the car and my mom, and Liability for me?

20090128103814AAp0hBr	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	No CEL flash when jumping diag. port terminals on a 94 Camaro.?	Yes this is a repost but I wanted to get the people on the east coast at a good time.  So anyway, my check engine light won't flash when I jump the A&B terminals at  the diagnostic port on my 94 Z28 Camaro it either stays on or off depending on when I jump it with the key on or key it up after its jumped.  It should at least flash a code 11 saying that the PCM can communicate.  But nothing.  It does turn on the fans and smog pump and all when jumped so I know the wires to the PCM are good, but no flashy flashy.  You shouldn't need a scan tool for this car since it's OBD1.  Thanks for the help.

20090128100631AAqpDfc	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	How can I start my own limosine / taxi company in NJ?	My wife and I would like to start our own business and we came up with the idea of a limo service company would be a real good one to benefit from. We all know that a limo or a taxi is always going to be needed no matter if the economy is up or down. I was thinking of maybe finding a job with one just to see how it all works. (which i don't think its rocket science either but who knows) So if any one who knows and can break it down for me as far as where would i get a license or certificate, is there a limit to how many cars, possible cost of insurance, equipment needed for the base and cars, etc.... Thanx so much :)
20090128094809AAnisYJ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Ever since I ran out of gas, car has been running funny. Now won't start.?	First off, it's a 2000 Grand Prix with 96,000 miles.I ran out of gas about a month and a half ago and the car has been having trouble starting ever since. It always starts, but it coughs for a while first.      When I turn my steering wheel the power in the car dims, lights go low and the AC slows down, this also happens when I put down the windows.       Today I went to start the car and this time the car did not start, it just keeps trying to turn over. Any suggestions?

20090128095007AAQrYHT	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Who misses full sized cars?	Okay, so there's still a few out there, like the Impala and 300C.  But in my opinion, those are NOT full sizes.        In my opinion, full sizes have to be at least 17 or 18 feet long, have V8s, rear wheel drive and six seats, with a column gearshift.        They seats have to be super plush, and the ride as smooth as possible.  By these standards, the only ones out there are the Mercury Grand Marquis and the Lincoln Town Car.  What happened, Detroit?  North America has lost it's signature car.      The last Impala I rode in, an '08, had none of those.  It wasn't big enough inside.  The ride was too stiff.  There was a CENTER CONSOLE D: and it had a V6 front wheel drive.

So I take my Audi  (98 A6 Quattro automatic) in to get fixed big time, new timing belt/chain, new brakes for the front, some transmission repairs, and a totally new AC/heater system, oil seals, o ring,  They say its all great and fixed.
