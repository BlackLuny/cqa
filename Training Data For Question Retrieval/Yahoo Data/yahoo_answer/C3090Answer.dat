AA11370460	If you like surfing the net and spending time on it, why not do social networking for your favorite company. Many companies don't have the time to sit on the net and chat with it's customers. You could pick your favorite company, maybe a clothing store, or hobby store- video games, restaurant, etc... and ask the owner if they would like for you to create a social club online for their store... you host the site, get friends to join, then have them spread the word to join. Use Facebook or MySpace to create it and have fun things like comments from people who bought items at the store, get updates from the manager about new things coming out, and post it on the site so the people who have joined the page learn about it first, have fun quizzes daily. The key to the success of any business is in keeping the customers happy and staying present to them. If you offer this service to managers and they see a great response from it, you could work from home and do this for many businesses! We're business owners and know how critical it is to stay current.|`|0boTBFEVaa	the person that just answer your question isnt yahoo staff you should report them|`|gaXUIduMaa	Mowing lawns (girls can do that too you know), housecleaning, run errands, private tutor, dog walker/sitter, paint walls (only for private individuals), busing tables for a small restaurant.  Anything that involves a business, you will need a work permit with your parents and schools permission.|`|6f744d0e67105d5078de04689dc78900aa	Mowing lawns, washing cars, helping people with their chores (cleaning their garage, raking leaves, etc.), proofreading younger kids' homework.  Hope that helps.  And good for you for looking for ways to earn some cash.
bru2xnlRaa	Stolen? Can't find it? Call the police after you check with the school. <br>  Very possible the school gives them to charity after the bike sits in their rack for a while. It becomes blight on their property if no one claims it.|`|5ddcafd96cc37651091167fd6bbdb57daa	I am interested as to where you may have lost the keys? At a friends house, or maybe out with friends or family? Anyway, the first place to look at would be who may have had access to the keys left behind. Secondly, Does the school know anything ref: Bike? Third, contact the local police department with the bikes serial number and descriptive information. A bike like that seen riding around town or in a bike shop/pawn shop doesn't happen every day. Best of luck.<br>  <br>  halo75

OK7dtsRqaa	When planning a big party we usually look into renting from the most central location of the Royal Canadian Legion. They rent out their hall for  very minimal fee you can decorate the hall yourselves to save even more. We have had some real good parties such as anniversary's, birthdays  and weddings at the Legion on Cyr St. in Vanier. Good luck and have fun.
7V8Fb0tIaa	Definitely a scam! <br>  <br>  I think I'm been targeted by them too. I got a call from a guy in America today asking me if i was still interested in the job and to complete and send back the employment agreement. The voice sounded Mexican but i cant be too sure plus the english was horrible on the other end. The number was - +12396037660. They have been using the following details for contact <br>  <br>  Claire Booker, HR Manager (apply@startendfin.com) <br>  <br>  I researched and found out that startendfin.com is a non operational website.<br>  <br>  The company's name is U-world LLC which does not seem to exist. <br>  <br>  What i did was googled their address which they had provided in the employment agreement - 211 West 92nd Street, Suite 57, New York, NY, 10025, USA<br>  <br>  Now check this out. One of the search results led to this- <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bobbear.co.uk/hlb-services-llc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bobbear.co.uk/hlb-services-ll...</a><br>  <br>  It seems that the same address has been used for many internet scams related to money laundering. My guess is that U-world LLC is the new name of hlb- services(major scam entity).<br>  <br>  STAY AWAY FROM THEM!<br>  <br>  Hope this information helps all the people targeted by them.
