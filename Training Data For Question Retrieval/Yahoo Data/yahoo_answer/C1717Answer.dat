gW0nD5cEaa	I don't know a lot about nickelodeons, or really silent movies, but they would have been the first time, especially with the movies that people saw anything outside of what was around them. It must have been shocking in a way. Today with television, ipods, radios, movies, CD's, we have everything in the world at our fingertips. Before that entertainment was music people played or sang themselves, a piano, a banjo. Now, they at least could see other things. <br>  <br>  I don't know that Charlie Chaplin movies changed the world in some ways, but since it was what they had, they saw things in a new light <br>  <br>  I don't know that silent films would have a direct effect on modern times, but I know so little about the actual work I don't know. But it started the whole movie and entertainment industry for one thing, the studios, etc. Movies led to TV, TV led to videos, etc. <br>  <br>  You have to write your own essay. I suggest doing a little research on your own, too.

DEglvDGDaa	I think Numpty is the correct term<br>  <br>  You are totally correct i what you ae saying about councils but I think it is more wide spread than that and a pandemic through the whole financial system.<br>  <br>  Banks will not lend to each other People who wish to buy cars are unable to do so, not because of their inability to pay but the inability to secure credit.<br>  <br>   Councils are panicking about the loss of revenue of council tax so their solution is to raise it to cover the shortfall causing more misery and more debt for people.<br>  <br>  One point I do wish to make is that the credit crunch has not fully come down from the banks yet and the repossessions we are seeing ae mainly due to highly irresponsible lending, people buying houses on 125 percent mortgages, 3 years later remortgaging and getting 20,,000 30,000 to help them by pay off a few debts buy a new car etc.<br>  <br>  In my opinion the starts and ends with the banks the govt must take some responsibility for the lack of regulation and the main opposition parties must share the same responsibility.<br>  <br>  If the banks went back to doing what they where doing 1 yr ago but more responsibly this mess would be sorted out within months.<br>  <br>  But if this matter is not dealt with now it could start a major snowball effect which would be devastating for this country.<br>  <br>  When this country last had such a recession it took us going to war for it to end, the recession of the 70s and 90s are not comparable today as there was not the effects of the markets and especially the Banks as we have today|`|AA12349988	So who is going to pay the extra that street lighting has cost your council this year with huge increases of electricity?<br>  <br>  Or what about the diesel in the trucks that empty your bin? or to take the meals on wheels round?<br>  <br>  Maybe we shouldn't give the school dinner lady a pay rise, or the receptionist at the local leisure centre?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh no screw everyone and everything else your tax burden is going up ￡0.86p a week.<br>  <br>  <br>  Many people who have lost their homes signed into debt that they had no chance of paying back unless their houses continued to rise in price at the levels that it was doing.  It is thereown fault and the banks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit <br>  <br>  Yes your interpretation is correct.  Many people will lose their homes becuase they didn't do there homework and signed into a 125% mortgage on a low interest rate for 3 years.  They expected their house to go up in value and then at the end they would remortgage.  Only now they cant they are stuck on the lenders standard rate and cant afford to pay.  The banks that offered this have been nationalised and the customers will have their houses taken off them.    And no I dont have  a lot of sympathy because now I am not only paying my own mortgage and providing for my own family but due to the greed of bankers and their customers I am stuck with a tax burden that I dont want and never ordered.  <br>  <br>  Look at the link below for a typical person who will have their house taken off them this year.<br>  <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlfO2K60FSVIh2387ikDEbkhBgx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090122072759AA3XxPq">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Of course it was the government who MADE them take this deal!!

The council and the water companies will be facing rising costs, which i would bet money on are more than they are passing on to the general public.  You have to ask yourself the question, would you rather a small raise in council tax or a reduction in the services it pays for? Same with water rates.  ￡45 per year is only ￡3.75 per month.  My rent is going up ￡5 per week but when I think of all the servies i get for it, its a good deal really.  And an increase of just over ￡2 per month water rates seems like a good deal too from where i am standing.<br>  <br>  Your very welcome, i am glad that my reply helped you to understand this better :)|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Serious times indeed, there is no magic wand that anyone can wave to make things better for home buyers and people that are about to lose their homes, and I often wonder if whatever Gordon Brown says is adding to the problem or a part of the solution at all. The whole govt is deluded it seems when you look at the difference between them and us how very little help will be given to a mortgage payer, yet a cabinet minister can claim over 100K living expenses on a home that wasn't even hers. The repercussions of the financial crisis are only beginning to manifest now, but really, the increases in council tax and water, though they don't help matters, are only small when you look at the bigger picture. Fuel and energy prices are still way too high, so everyone's operating costs have gone up tremendously, so all bills must be increased to offset the energy and transport costs. I actually work in the water industry, and our biggest outlay after wages is energy costs. What people forget is that water has to be pumped and pressure maintained by pumps that are powered by electricity. Industry generally has similar on-costs and this will be hitting other industries even harder than the water industry, hence all the redundancies.<br>  <br>  I despair, I don't see where this is all going, we are in deep trouble for sure with a national debt announced this morning at 2 TRILLION ￡. What can one say, but OMG?

viqIb6X7aa	It is hard to understand Israeli politics but the majority of people voted for a right wing government. Although the Likuid did not win (they lost by one seat) they are wanted by the public. Left wing parties did not have enough votes to properly represent the Israeli public. Also Gaza is run by terrorist who use children as barriers so it makes it a little difficult for Israel to make peace talks. As Golda Meir once said Israel will be able to make peace as soon as the Palestinians love their children more then they hate us.|`|9SB2Y5r8aa	In fact peace is so far even if talks held Between winners or losers : Palestinians were always ready to accept peace despite it's shameful to Palestinians; as they are pigging peace from the coward Israeli leaders without getting a minimum interest to any needs of Palestinian people. <br>  Now after Israeli  ignorance of peace agreements, the majority of Palestinians believe that what was taken by force will be redeemed only by force. <br>  To clarify Palestinians position of their crises; here is a summary of the story:<br>  Palestine was under the British occupation after 1st world war  .  1<br>     1  Britain and the European countries arranged to get red of the Jewish and send them away of Europe and encouraged and gave support to introduce Jewish from Europe to Palestine.<br>  In 1948 the British army delivered part of Palestine and most of British weapons hand to hand to Jewish troops .2<br>  2 2  Any Palestinian reported to has a knife or small gun may be hanged by the British army.<br>  Jewish troops built a terrorist organization called Israel by The USA and Europe full support .In 1967 Israeli troops occupied the rest of Palestine. Since that time any one says a word or makes any action regarding freedom of Palestine will be arrested or killed .Other Palestinians became refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, 1n 1993 Arafat & Abbas made a shameful peace agreement with Israel without taking any action towards implementing of any item of this agreement. HAMAS is an Islamic party who got majority of the votes in Palestinian 2006 elections. Hamas objectives to liberate Palestine from Israeli occupation .But Abbas party supported by USA and Israel tried to get red of Hamas Islamic power .Hamas has a national people support in Gaza succeeded in minimizing Abbas party influence in Gaza and get full power in Gaza since June 2007.Now Israel trying to get rid of Hamas but by killing children and women and destroying the infrastructure in Gaza using phosphorus mortars and chemical weapons.<br>  Palestinians had suffered in loosing their lives, homes and land and still suffering in many aspects such as -  for example only:<br>  1- Millions of refugees living in a very terrible situation.<br>  2- Hundreds thousands of martyrs, injures, disables and prisoners among the Palestinian community. <br>  3- Thousands of destroyed villages, buildings (homes, schools, mosques, hospitals,).<br>  4- Millions of destroyed trees.<br>  5- Hundreds of Settlements surrounding Palestinian cities and villages <br>  6- The Racist wall crossing the heart of Palestine destroying thousands of acres of Palestinians' lands. <br>  7- Others.<br>  Now the Palestinians have a collection of issues needs immediate solutions such as – for example only: <br>  1- International announcement to identify all Palestinian fighting parties as freedom fighters and stop any indication, reference or mentioning of terrorism or similar words directly or indirectly in relation to any Palestinian. <br>  2- Free all prisoners.<br>  3- Let all refugees return back to homes, properties and land in Palestine, and get the right to practice normal liberal and free life with full influence on land, seaports and airports of Palestine.<br>  4-  Have full indemnification in respect of all aspects of suffering to be paid for every person related directly or indirectly to any aspect of suffering.<br>  5- Remove all the settlements. <br>  6- Remove the Racist wall completely.<br>  7- Others.<br>  Then Palestinians can begin peace negotiation, otherwise peace is so far.|`|Uac9AXmDaa	I do not get it|`|GDwMdfqjaa	First of all - No one in Israel will ever recognize Hamas until it drops its objection of seeking the destuction of Israel.<br>  <br>  When Hamas was elected, before the coupe in which they completely took over Gaza, Israel and the US said they're willing to negotiate with the Hamas, but only if Hamas drops its alledged goal of "pushing the Jews into the sea". Hamas refused.<br>  <br>  And as for your answer - the losing parties which won't become part of the government will go into the parliamental opposition. That means that they won't have anything to do with with the politics other than parliament voting. I have no idea where you heard that thing, but it's false.|`|InW0bIkwaa	Some people need to get a clue.  Many Arab nations, including Egypt which has a border with Gaza, do not recognize Hamas as a legitimate ruling power in the region.  They have stated on numerous occasions that they will continue to keep the border crossings closed with Gaza until Abbas is able to get Hamas under control.<br>  <br>  You talk about peace for the Palestinians, when they already fight amongst themselves...killing each other everyday.
zN1uPBAxaa	Israel is continuously attacked by Hamas, Hezbollah, or any other fanatical groups in Palestine and Lebanon They are only trying to live peacefully, and mind their own business. Middle eastern fanatics typically hate America for supporting Israel. Americans are fighting in Afghanistan because the local fanatics in Afghanistan claimed responsibilityfor the Sep. 11th attacks. Americans invaded Iraq to remove a corrupt, and dangerous government, and assist the Iraqi people to set up their own democracy.   In my opinion, having been to some of these places, everything is justified, and the progress is great too. Although, I believe that instead of replacing a corrupt government, and reviving a country half a world away, we should have done so with a poor, failing, corrupt country just south of our own border. God bless America, United Kingdom, Europe, and Israel!|`|2pvAbIDUaa	nobody does. not even the ones that are fighting|`|H3zTS7khaa	Read a little,you might get a glimps of whats going on.
bcc9b2244c635c5b359d3c88d4d14878aa	Was trying to think of an answer like a politician would give, but can't think of one.

Lbulud8raa	I have read similar outlines regarding this before.  I find it pretty fair.    How about a deal?  Once I can go to places in the Mid East, Hong Kong, India and Africa and NOT hear similar pejorative terms about white people, such as "gweilo" in Hong Kong (just to mention one), then I will take all this anti-Golliwog thing a bit more seriously.  It seems to me that only whites have to feel guilty about racism and only whites are normally labelled as racist.  You will find that it is normally only whites who go out of their way not to be racist in actions or words.    I reject the idea that racisn is caused of mostly done by whites, having travelled to more than 130 countries and I spend my time actually amongst the people.  Most of the world is racist....I don't let it bother me because I treat others as idividuals.    Vacant Lot:  Hehehe, great answer,  well thought out and it speaks to the logical conclusion that all cultures place themselves as unique and special.  Mind you, not sure about the Santa-Jesus connection in the minds of most people.|`|AA10310496	I'd just like to say that I had a Golliwog doll when I was a young un...it was just a doll, nothing more and nothing less...just like my other rag dolls were.|`|oMF6bXCZaa	You seem to be fascinated with this subject.  Why???|`|hZIVKiFdaa	Or maybe it just answers your own question.|`|TqP2bhu2aa	if you think golliwog is bad just try naming a bear Mohamed     the world has gone pc mad|`|HUlyRTrraa	I think it's a pretty good explanation.    As I read it , it occurred to me that I have never seen a skinhead (stereotyping sorry) BNP supporter charging down the road with a Gollywog on a stick - have you?    Imagine the BNP getting their dollies out!? lol..|`|PNFjOSRoaa	I'm not sure how long you will last on here with that avatar but there are much worse getting away with such things.    I think Golliwogs are really cool and are sadly missed.    The kids loved them. We could easily ban Santa Claus  because of the relevance to a Saint hence being too Pro Christian  and also the massive corporate connection with Coca Cola = Sugar and Cocoa = Slave Trade.    We could say a Snowman discriminates against Eskimo people or those from the Icelandic or Polar regions.    The Leprachaun and tricolours daubed everywhere around St.Patrick's Day could be deemed Pro Irish Republican = IRA.    It could go on and on and is a total load of useless negative garbage.  I have many many black friends and they find no offence whatsoever in Golliwogs.    BRING BACK GOLLIWOGS NOW !!!
AA11226180	Ironic and infuriating .v.  (that little sign there is two eyeballs with mad eye brows in case you didn't know !!)    But yea, I would love to see the TRUE tax report on obama and his wife. I bet it gives these low life's a run for their money....or should I say OUR money?    This is a hideous joke on "US" and it really makes me mad.    I know no one is perfect and everyone has things in their past that we wouldn't be 'proud' of but give me a break ! These idiots are supposed to be 'professionals' . They darn well know that people are going to look at them in a different light.They can't be plain stupid,that would be too easy and you aren't going to get where they are if you are just 'dumb' you know what I mean.    This is nothing less than pure arrogance,thinking that YOU are better than the average tax paying citizen,thinking you deserve to be treated better...you get the idea. These people make me sick.    Any regular person would be in a heap of trouble for doing what they have ALL done. These people didn't just over look say,a years worth of taxes, or a quarter or what ever...no, they have simply chose NOT to pay taxes and they have gotten away with it and they only paid back when they were caught red handed.    Then they act all apologetic ??? Bull crap ! The only thing they are sorry for is their law breaking ways caught up to them.  And I might buy that they are a little sorry for embarrassing themselves. But othe rthan that,nope, don't think they are sorry for what they have done and most probably still are evading their responsibility.  Yeah, no wonder some of these freaks are so willing to raise taxes.    The other ironic thing is this last clown,daschle, has been QUOTED saying how people should pay their taxes and if they don't the law should be followed by the letter when punishing them...you can look it up on the news,Iw atched the clip just this morning.    What a JOKE.  and NO obama....I don't beleive for ONE second that 'you just had no idea' of the kind of crooks you are bringing in the White House.|`|lqVhxD3xaa	Yep - the demorats are a menace to society.|`|4Rh1qQAoaa	My goodness you have hit the liberal on the flat head! It truly is sickening, eh, that Obama can elect officials to be the HEAD OF THE NATIONS FINANCES when they owe the nation money themselves!! Let me just say a big AMEN that Dimwit Daschle dropped out. If i wasn't a Christian, i hate to think this, but i woudn't pay my taxes becuase of the A] abortion money issue B] Head of Finances who would use my money to pay his OWN back taxes. I find it sickening. Is Canada any better?    No..|`|YxwA5sjwaa	I think it's hilarious!  Just watching the Obama Administration fall apart is worth all the drama.  I knew this was going to happen months ago, when it seemed inevitable that he was going to be elected.  I just didn't know it would happen so fast.  Obama is so in love with himself that he thinks he can do no wrong.  Including getting his own boys in high places, no matter what!  Watch as he implodes.  I just hope and pray that someone out there can save the world from the damage he will do.|`|bxxwhP04aa	Kinda fun watching the new administration continually shooting themselves in the feet.|`|09409387b5e563591bca040cbb27b777aa	Patriotism and religion are only for the poor and middle class.

DypTl9Zdaa	I have to comment on some of the answers who state that Obama promised to remove troops from Iraq and not Afghanistan.  What most people don't understand is that Obama made an empty promise to his uninformed voters because the agreement to start removing troops from Iraq had already been signed by Bush beforehand.  But I guess that's what politicians do.  They say things that sound good and most of the time they count on their voters not really doing their homework and learning what the truth is.<br>  <br>  As far as Afghanistan goes...he really never said he would remove troops from there.  He said that he saw a problem that needed to be dealt with.  It is good that you are questioning things though so you can learn.  I don't know what your thoughts are on the Israel/Gaza thing but were you aware that Israel was one of the US's biggest allies?  Until Obama was elected that is.  Israel stopped allowing the Hamas terrorize them as soon as they saw who we elected President because they knew that we would no longer help them.  Did you also know that the Hamas are a terrorist group and that Obama signed a bill sending them 20.3 million dollars.  The argument could be said that it wasn't being sent to Hamas but to the civilians in Gaza but everyone already knew that the Hamas was stealing all supplies from the civilians and Obama sent it anyway.|`|nkA5NMUsaa	i don't recall him saying that.he was going to withdraw from iraq.<br>  i doubt he will do that either until it's stable.the increase in afghanistan<br>  is to try surge like bush did in iraq.it worked there.<br>  politicians seldom do what they say they are going to do.|`|uJhrqJCDaa	There is the matter of a war that is ongoing.<br>  <br>  Just because you no longer have the stomach for it doesn't mean the enemy doesn't.|`|t27SvIPbaa	You are surprised that a politician lies?<br>  WATCH - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAH3AeFy0SY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAH3AeFy0...</a><br>  (Most popular you tube video of politician’s lying)<br>  <br>  Bush said that the troops would be there for the next hundred years but that was not reported in the mainstream media because they do not want you to know the truth about anything.<br>  <br>  WATCH - and see that the troops are in Afghanistan to profit from the opium trade.  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3HYu4CcgU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W3HYu4Cc...</a><br>  (Afganisatan opium and bin laden)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWDthX7SFU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enWDthX7S...</a><br>  (CIA World war 3)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aoihQtyRYo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aoihQtyR...</a><br>  (Who funds wars)<br>  <br>  WATCH the evidence about Clinton kept from the public, womanising, drug baron and murder.

vgPH9Engaa	People like to think that America is moving away from caring about skin color.  But then this happens and people like Al Sharpton scream racism, even though there is no mention of skin color in the cartoon.  The double standard arises from their faulty logic.  They want to promote equality by focusing on how we're different.  In the process, they limit words and images other people can use.<br>  <br>  When someone says something, it conjures up an image in our minds, subjectively.  And when something is compared to something else, the correlation is subjective.  In this case, a wide group of people subjectively correlated the derogatory statement, "Black people are monkeys" with the image, rather than the intended context (as has been in use since 2000), "The President is as smart as a monkey."  Because this group of people falsely correlated the image, they protested, claiming that their interpretation was that of the cartoonist's as well.  It would be akin to me interpreting their protests as a fight against free speech.  It is not their intent, but it could be read that way.  <br>  <br>  The cartoonist could have foreseen the possible interpretation.  Should have foreseen it.  But then again, he shouldn't not-write it for the simple fact that some people will be upset.  It's impossible to keep everyone happy.  Someone will be angry no matter what you do.  It will probably be Al Sharpton.<br>  <br>  I have basically done nothing but agree with the comments made by the questioner.  However, I disagree that "this says more about the condition of racism in America..."  This direct instance is about racism, yes.  But the overall issue is not racism.  It's really about what type of language and images can be used by certain people.  It just becomes clearest in racism issues.  But the issue arises in non-racist scenarios as well.<br>  <br>  Books are banned on racist accounts, but also if they contain drug use, violence, sexual content, or thoughts contrary to a religious perspective.  People think they have the right to be comfortable.  But they don't.  The reason that right is not allowed is because different things make us uncomfortable.  People are afraid of heights...does it mean we should tear down skyscrapers?  Of course not.  People don't like crowded places, but we shouldn't destroy every baseball stadium in America, cancel every concert, stop every subway.  The proper way to handle it is to accept that certain situations and words and images convey different things to different people.  The improper way to handle it is to take our ideas and generalize them onto others.<br>  <br>  Certainly it's possible that the cartoonist DID have racial intentions.  It's just as possible that he didn't.  But what happened to 'innocent until proven guilty?'  The protestors have taken their interpretation and generalized it onto the author and the Post.  They have accused the cartoonist without just cause.  There's a thousand reasons to hate the New York Post.  This cartoon is not one of them.  Just like there's a thousand reasons to hate Al Sharpton.  Right now, his reaction to the cartoon is number one on the list.|`|qvuQSQvpaa	because of the history of relating blacks to being something less than human. its xxtra racist. and most of the blame should go to the editors for not realizing the potential of what would be stirred up in releasing it. too stupid|`|IqUbpid6aa	You can see that there is a subliminal conscience in many people.

It was a  shot at Nancy Pelosi NOT the Bamster!  Everybody is just so quick to read racism into anything and everything regarding Obama and the current edition of our so-called leaders.  It's bordering on nauseating and actually I would say that there is an excessive amount of reverse racism these days.  It's perfectly fine for black people to call each other derogatory terms but if a white person does that ( either on purpose or inadvertently) or makes any reference to anything that someone may deem "color and/or race oriented" then they are a racist and they should be held accountable.  It's not fair and it's not right.  <br>  <br>  More LIBERAL do as I say NOT as I DO! B.S.|`|FUcYuZ8saa	you say " in the case of Dubya, its all gravy, but when it is done to a black man, it is racist and should be punished??? Why the double standard?"<br>  <br>  Because it's permissable to degrade a white man, but not a black man. It's only racism if it's done to a minority.  White people can't claim racism, even though by definition it is EXACTLY THE SAME THING.<br>  <br>  Go figure.|`|f6qmRicQaa	Their point, if I understand it, is that there was a time in American history, not all that long ago, that black men were referred to as apes, chimps, and monkeys simply for the color of their skin.  It was done so through the media in political cartoons and through laws that relegated African Americans to second class citizenship.  When Bush was compared to a monkey it was done so with the intention of insulting his intelligence, his bumbling of words, his general  appearance of ignorance.  Now if someone was to compare Obama to a monkey there are racist undertones just because of the history involved.<br>  <br>  Now with all that being said I think the hoopla being made over the Post cartoon is a big giant stinking pile of horse crap!  It was obvious to any person with one iota of intelligence that it was taking a stab at the dim whits that are making the stimulus bill, not Obama personally.  I think Sharpton and his cronies are making mountains out of mole hills and just need something to keep their names in the news.  Shame on him, and shame on the people who see racism where there simply is none.  And where is the Post's backbone anyway?  The are caving in to these instigators, shame on them too.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I know the cartoon you're on about and I thought it was very funny.

After all a dead monkey shot by a policeman and the other officer asking who will write the other stimulus bill could not suggest anything else.<br>  <br>  for shame<br>  <br>  Edit<br>  "You've never heard racists call black people monkeys? Doubtful. That comic was indeed disgusting, in my opinion. "<br>  Wow - so it was fine to portray former Pres.Bush as a monkey based on his views and actions? <br>  But to do so with Pres.Obama is a no no? Why?<br>  <br>  You ASSUME a racist slant to the cartoon because it showed a monkey shot with the police officer asking who was going to write the next stimulus bill<br>  <br>  I DO NOT ASSUME a racist slant to the cartoon because of the officer asking who is going to write the next stimulus bill.<br>  Why? Congress was the one bickering on the stimulus bill. Pres.Obama was the one who signed and authorized it.<br>  If the cartoon had the officer say "Who's going to sign the next stimulus bill", then yes, I would say that the cartoon is racist.<br>  <br>  But as it stands, the only person that knows exactly what the intent is behind the cartoon is the artist.<br>  <br>  Everything else that people are saying is an assumption.<br>  Including my own personal opinion.|`|QlQYGlifaa	You've never heard racists call black people monkeys?

GWB was the most simple minded, intellectually deficient man to take the white house....ever.  <br>  <br>  so he is worthy of being compared to a chimp.  but obama has done nothing yet worthy of chimp-comparison.  so they are not  comparing him to a chimp based on him being a moron.  so what are they comparing him to a chimp for?<br>  <br>  i mean rip on the stimulus package if and when it fails.  not before we know its results, eh?

I am on the side of the guy that was out there making a living.|`|aGcRB3pyaa	If the dog was vicious, and went after the worker, I believe he had every right to defend himself.<br>  The Utility company is making the offer, to avoid a lawsuit.|`|Ao3Fl3iSaa	how do you know that he didn't have a psychological issue with dogs?|`|WsMXhqcZaa	It seems that there are people here who haven't been bitten by a dog. <br>  <br>  Those little dogs don't just nip and their teeth aren't straight. The teeth are sharp and curved which makes the bite all the worse as it tears at the muscle.  It was the misfortune of the dog for being so small. It doesn't take much effort to hurt or kill them. Heck, they can break their own leg just jumping down. <br>  <br>  Yes, the worker had a right to kick the dog. It was an accident that it was killed due to its small size.<br>  <br>  Owner said she didn't have time to put down the baby and get to the dog. What if the dog was after a little kid and got in the kids face? What kind of story would we have then?   <br>  Sorry. You don't let your dog "get out" and then get upset when bad things happen.|`|23F70N1Raa	Any animal that will attack is considered dangerous.  Just because it is small, the animal can still cause damage.  Many people have the misconception that size makes a difference in how vicious a dog can be... but it is more "how much" damage a dog can do based on size.  Small dogs tend to be easily intimidated and sometimes can be crabbier than larger dogs.  It is not uncommon to find dogs attacking at all different sizes... it is just again the matter of how much damage the animal can do.  A small dog has the ability to still break skin... this makes it able to be vicious and a person has a right to defend themselves against a dog of any size.  Sure, we see little chihuahuas and think they are cute and cuddly... but in reality they can be just as dangerous as a large dog.... lets be honest... they are not human... they are animals... and like humans... they all have different personalities and behaviors.|`|7e0356e9b4ce8ac13f39c23ba748f638aa	My dad had a psycho Chihuahua.<br>  If anyone, other than my dad, went near him he'd growl and start snapping at you.<br>  And once they start biting they don't stop, like Pit bulls.<br>  <br>  That utility worker had every right to defend himself.<br>  And that was pretty generous of him to offer $500 for a mutt that costs half that much by breeders.|`|f6qmRicQaa	A tea cup Chihuahua, come on dangerous?  Sounds like the man was an ******, but the lady should have put the dog up.  His kicking the dog was way out of line.

After they left snipers from Gaza started shooting across the border at Israeli farmers. When Israel retaliated for these shootings everyone said "oh look... Israel broke the ceasefire!!" Then Hamas started shooting rockets into Israel. Even when Israel pulls out of an occupied territory, Palestinians still want to fight. Israel waited years before responding to the rocket attacks. And Israel even warned Hamas that they would attack if the rockets didn't stop. Another thing that no one seems to remember is the reason for the security fences and blockades is because of the years of terrorist attacks inside Israel. Maybe some people on here aren't old enough to remember, but when I was growing up I heard news reports all the time about Buses and schools and markets being blown up by Palestinian terrorists. I can understand why they put up fences. Israel was tired of innocent civilians being murdered by terrorists.|`|HQKuzxulaa	Israelis should have ended all their operations in Gaza and the West Bank over 5 decades ago, but Israel isn't interested in peace.

They have no right to put pressure on Israel to open boarder crossings with grenades and mortar rockets. It hasn't worked in the past, and will only create more resistance as it persists in the future. Israel has already started a process of changing to a more right-winged leadership due to these attacks, and peace talks look to be a distant memory. Fatah is the link to peace.
