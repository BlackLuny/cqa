20090205045627AAyAjVu	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Im 23 years old.Should i go back to bartending (Long but interesting and simple story)?	I started bartending at age 22.I got hired at a local bar in Riverside califoria.I was so exited because i never did it before and its my type of job.i could really connect to anyone and im super friendly, sarcastic and passionate. Plus i love meeting new people. However,the down side was this bar was real empty most of the time.PlusI had to deal with a bunch of rude wyno drunk *** old regulars and i hated most of them.The manager of the place just threw me behind the bar without giving me a good understanding of what bartnding was about. When i got hired i had zero experience and did not know that handling the crowd was part of the job so i let a lot of rude drunk customers get away with their loud mouths..Would i have known that i am in control  i would have never tolerated their rude assds and would have demanded my respect.I let the customers get rude with me and get away with it.In that bar i had no security and the bosses were not there most of the time so i had to deal with situations on my own.Well after working there i got real discouraged about going back behind the bar again.Point is, i recently i moved to San Francisco and i have been thinking about bartending out here because i heard its really good money.I could be making from 100- 300 a night.. I mean it wasnt bad all the time..I hated it only because of the drunk regulers who got comfortable beinng rude and getting away with it and since that bar was the slowest bar in the world, the drunkies had enough room to do it.the fact that we didnt have security during the day bothered me a lot too.Had i known that they wouldnt fire me for setting those rude customers straight and i would have done it!! There was a lot of upsides too.At times I had really good times and i would be having so much fun. And not to mention on fridays (our only busy dayz) the tips were great..I would leave with $150-$200. Well out here I heard i could be making so much more money ..And i would most likely always have security. ..And the busier it is the less room anyone has to be rude or say anything at all other than the drink they want.. and the busier it is the more money...It seems to be  different ball game..and Now that i got the experience i know how to set a rude customer straight if needed to do so..Should i try bartending out out here?

20090205063540AAqazRu	Food & Drink;Beer, Wine & Spirits	Do I have to have a bartender? Can we still BYO with a bartender?	I rented a little township-owned house in NJ to have my wedding at. The person we initially spoke to told us we were responsible for buying alcohol separately because it wasn't part of the package, and gave me the name of a recommended vendor. The person who has since taken over for her now tells us that the vendor is required. She says he has the liquor license, we must purchase from him, and he must bartend. I thought since we were going to bring our own, we didn't need a license or bartender. The wedding is small and I can get a better deal elsewhere. We submitted payment for the house already and the township mailed us a contract, listing only name, location, date/time, party size, and the house's caterer's info. No bartender is mentioned. Can someone explain to me why it would be required (other than because they say so)?

20090205075918AAJChMa	Food & Drink;Other - Food & Drink	Do you think coffee drinkers like a variety of coffees?	What are your thoughts on coffee?  I'm not necessarily interested in Starbucks foo-foo coffees, just your basic coffee you make at home and your different additives...  IE:  Folgers, Tasters Choice, Maxwell House... and which blends... If you buy only Starbucks off the shelf to make at home, I want to know why.    Drinking coffee is as personal to me, as having your favorite mixed drink, yes the one that contains alcohol.  That first one and about   the first have of your second taste delicious... There's a distinctness about each of these that makes us choose them over and over.      I like Yuban Dark Roast... it's got a flavor that appeals to me.  However, I get tired of the same old thing and have found myself buying smaller containers, and trying out different brands lately.  Like currently, I have Folgers Medium Roast in my pantry.  I like it, but I like a darker roast, I've found... Folgers isn't the worst I've had, but it's a trusty stand by in a pinch.     Anyway... I'm interested in others opinions or suggestions of coffees to try, and why do you like them?  :o)  Thanks!
