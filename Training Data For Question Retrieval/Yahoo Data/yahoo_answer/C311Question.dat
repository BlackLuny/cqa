He is a Pisces, and he broke up with me awhile ago. When we broke up, he said we'd still be friends. However, I think because I still had feelings for him back then, we couldn't be. I've dated a lot of other guys since our break-up and am completely over him. Anyway, I still would like to be his friend, and I think now we can be. I just don't know how to go about doing it. I've sent him a short email every few months. He stopped responding with the exception of one time when it was my birthday. I was bummed he forgot, so I called him on it. He wrote back and said happy birthday. I'll call you when I'm in Cali next; he lives in Texas. He never called. Anyway, like I said, tomorrow is his birthday. Usually I'd send him an email. I'm tired of feeling like I'm wasting my time, though. I bet he won't respond, and I'm wondering if we could ever be friends. Pisces, how could I go about being his friend? Also, regardless of your sign, would you guys write him? Please say what sign you are; thank you:)

20090307150917AAAe12B	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	How do you become a child or teen actress?	I have always been interested in theater and love to dance, sing, and act. Everybody has always said I have really great potential and I have good looks too. I am a hard worker and like challenges big or small. At school I get straight A's on my report card except for the occasional B+. I'm good at changing rolls and personalities quickly and still get back to my normal self after the rehearsal, audition, etc. I work well with others and know when to be funny and when to get serious. I would love to become a young actress like Miranda Cosgrove or Abigail Breslin, however; I am only in my early teens and don't know how to get to an audition for a movie( much less hear about one) or how to contact an agent. I am trying to gather as much information as possible and was wondering if there was anyone out there that could supply me with some knowledge about the acting world.   Thank you for your time.

20090227084223AAi6Kmi	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	I giggled at this joke?will u?	A blonde went to a flight school insisting she wanted to learn to fly.       As all the planes were currently in use, the owner agreed to instruct her by radio on how to pilot the solo helicopter.       He took her out, showed her how to start it and gave her the basics, and sent her on her way. After she climbed 1000 feet, she radioed in. "I'm doing great! I love it!       The view is so beautiful, and I'm starting to get the hang of this."       After 2000 feet, she radioed again, saying how easy it was to fly. The instructor watched her climb over 3000 feet, and was beginning to worry that she hadn't radioed in.       A few minutes later, he watched in horror as she crashed about half a mile away.       He ran over and pulled her from the wreckage.    When he asked what happened, she said,    "I don't know! Everything was going fine, but as I got higher, I was starting to get cold.       I can barely remember anything after I turned off the big fan!"

20090307160044AA3TeJo	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What do you think of of what i've written and do you think it has song potential?	Okay, so here goes. This is just a poem thus far but a few tweaks here and there, and some additions and subtractions, i think i could make into a song. Here is the main gist; tell me what you think:      Change   I am ready to change and become a new person.    A redefined version of the girl that I was.   I’m ready to live and to dare and excursion.    And scream to the world ‘I’m alive!’ just because   I’m ready to breathe in the stench that arises    from bridges I’ve burned and the love I’ve let die   I’m ready to bask in the wake of surprises    and never choke back any tears that I’ll cry.   I’m ready to love and ready to fight,    and ready to choose from my wrong and my right   And so now, as time, with her cool gentle hand,    guides me through fate in a strange foreign land,   Beckoning me with a mysterious smile,    coaxing me on as I cover the miles,   I realize maybe she’s not on my side,    yet she is the only one in which I confide.          if you hate it, that's fine, but tell me WHY you hate it instead of just bashing   thanks!

20090307155005AAuP1UB	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Did Chris Brown just make a mistake?	Some young girls have been hysterical over the situation between Chris Brown and Rihanna. They're not hysterical because of what he did to her, they're hysterical over how people are perceiving him now. These young ladies go on to excuse this punk's behavior by saying everybody makes mistakes. Huh? What? A mistake is forgetting to put baking powder in your cake or putting salt instead of sugar in the kool aid not pounding a woman's face with your fist and biting her. That mess was deliberate. And, this wasn't the first time. This was just the first time that it was made public. My question is, why are so many young girls so smitten by an obvious woman beater?  It makes me sad and scared for thier future relationships. I shudder to think of what would happen if they were ever in a situation like that of Rihanna and Chris. Would it still be just a mistake?

20090227084632AAxVqMm	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Sex Scene: What is the name of this movie?	Could anyone tell me the name of this movie? Here we go:      In the movie there was a sex scene. The man was lying on the bed and the woman was on the top. She was using a bed-sheet to pull herself up on the top of the man. (bed-sheet attached to a ring on the top wall) After that she started spinning around herself while he is still inside of her.      So, the woman is pulling something like a bed-sheet and turns around herself while still he is inside of her.      Basically, she pulls herself up to sex with him. And she is spinning around herself.      That's the only thing i remember from this movie.      Sorry for my English. I hope you get the idea.      Thanks in advance.

20090307114403AAs2XE8	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Are you growing up to fast?	Wake one morning, feel like I'm not myself   Concerned about everything, even my health   My mind with all this complex thinking   My adulthood rising and my childhood sinking   As I told myself I ain't a kid anymore   Get dressed and pick my books off the floor   Only fifteen with my future in my sights   Its plain to see like its in my headlights   No childish thoughts provoke what I say   Just trying to get up and get through another day   Whats wrong with me, am I growing up to fast   Time to get ready, no time too rejoice in ones past   Why am I doing this, I wish I can turn back time   I wish I could relive the childhood that was once mine      Shave that beard, and put on some cologne   Working with what I can, pretty much all alone   Put my wristwatch on, and say a little prayer   Remember me if you want, I really don't care   Put on my new blue suit and tie that tie tight   If I could relive my childhood, everything would be alright      Entered the world a boy, and now I'm a man   It was like a flash of light, was it a part of His plan   What do I think of my past, I begin to wonder   Did I make use of it, or was it just a blunder   Was it put to good use, or just a waste of life   Did I do good, and did I do what was right   All these thoughts penetrate like ax through wood   As I remember that what I lived was pretty good   The childhood I had was f**ked up but not bad   So I'll remember all the good times that I had   If your young, remember your youth is gold   Never take anything for granted, or let be sold   Childhood is short lived, so make it last   Or you'll end up like me, and idiot looking at his own past      Shave that beard, and put on some cologne   Working with what I can, pretty much all alone   Put my wristwatch on, and say a little prayer   Remember me if you want, I really don't care   Put on my new blue suit and tie that tie tight   If I could relive my childhood, everything would be alright      The Midwest Arsonist

20090227085232AApi8tj	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Would a one armed TV host/hostess scare or offend you?	I saw in the news where a one armed British TV hostess of a children's show is being criticized because some parents believe that she will scare their children when they see that she has a missing arm, at least part of it.      The woman was born that way and I think it's great that she has carved out a normal life and is not embarrassed to show her arm.  It should serve a a great example of perseverance, acceptance and pride to children.  Instead, these parents are making ugly comments and want the woman removed from the show.       I can't believe that many British people are so closed-minded that they would want to get rid of the woman rather than use the opportunity to teach their children that some people are "different" yet still acceptable and normal.      Question for Americans and other non-British people:  Is this woman so offensive to you?  What are your views on the whole thing?

So does it make sense for Canadians in Canada to choose to pay outrageous high prices for their own Canadian goods when American goods are available to them and cheaper by 50% compared to their own products?         During recession in Canada it's the people in Canada that are effected for example if they are paying $2.99 for Colgate extra whitening toothpaste in 130ml size instead of paying only $1.49 for Creat extra whitening toothepaste at 130ml they of course would be deeper in recession.

While many people join them purely out of curiosity or for a laugh, would you be happy if your partner visits them?    Do you expect your partner to erase them once you two are exclusive?   Would you be suspicious if your guy/gal was frequenting them, do you think it means they are looking to cheat, even if there are no other signs in the relationship?   At what point for you would you call it cheating? Is it advertising yourself there as available, not until you start corresponding with someone, or not unless you develop feelings for them or meet them in person?   Do you think it's okay to talk to people online in [sexual] manner that in person would be inappropriate if you're taken? Any ideas why some people think the anonymity of online sites let them believe it is always innocent.

I remembered he made this famous soprano singer sing chamber music on a social event and it went marvelous... The composer was also active in polictics something like that... there was a scene where him and the soprano sang in a horseride something about love... in the end he was suppose to run away with the soprano singer but the girl decided to let him go since his wife loved him so much... the scene of the wife was really heartwarming since she let go of the composer also... the ending was they were old and there was this huge crowd praising the now also old prince..          i think the composer was Johan Sebastian Bach?? or something that sounds like that... ive googled this but no movie...      PLEASE HELP      thank you

20090227085443AAM2yh8	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Can anyone come with an ORIGINAL argument against hip hop? (INTELLIGENT DEBATE ONLY!!!)?	This isn't a intended to be confrontational... I'm genuinely curious about why some people still, in 2009, make the "rap isn't music" argument.    I still have yet to read anyone's criticism that isn't simply a rehash of the same things every generation says about the music that emerges after their "time" or isn't based on the premise that all hip hop has violent, misogynistic or materialistic themes. This is incorrect, as has been proven thousands of times before since anyone who's a serious fan of hip hop could name 10 MC's off the top of their head who don't fit that category.      So... as the title asks... can anyone make an ORIGINAL argument against hip hop?

20090307095858AAiBenF	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is the name of these scary movies?	I remember seeing trailers for them, but I can't remember the names.      One was a movie where these people's friend died, but is trying to contact them through videos on the computer and technology. I remember seeing Christina Milian in it. A scene with her was that she was doing laundry and there was something in the washer and it attacked her or something.      The next one is a movie about this girl who is baby sitting one or two kids and gets this creepy call. She keeps getting calls from this person and the kids go missing or something. I think Camilla Belle was it in, I'm not sure.      If you can help me, thanks!

20090227085410AANpVD6	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are some good not-so-commonly-known rock bands?	There's just so many out there these days and it's hard sometimes to discover 'em.  A few that I highly recommend are:      Machinae Supremacy - like a mix between linkin park and static-x, I just came across them recently and I'm just blown away by how good they are, you have to check this one out.  Check out the album "Overworld" first      The 69 Eyes - Somewhat well know, Gothic rock.  Unbelievable sound with a powerful spirit built into it.  Truly a rock and roll gem.       Anberlin - Not sure exactly how well know they are, but I hadn't heard of them until recently.  They're on the lighter side but are unbelievably talented and grow on you big time.  Check out "Cities" first.      Type O Negative - Pretty well known but if you haven't heard much of them, you should.
20090227085453AASLazQ	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	What do you think about the show "LOST"?	Last September, I watched an episode of Lost and was a little interested. But, a friend had all the first 3 seasons on DVD. So, I watched them from episode 1-the end of season 3. Of course Season 4 didn't come out on DVD until December. So, I had to wait to see that. But I was honestly traumatized. I "Needed" to see the next season. And then I found the season on the Website. So, I was caught up. Then this season started. And I am traumatized again. See, I was always able to watch them with no worries of waiting a week. LOL This is even silly to write out. But I am completely addicted to this show. After watching last night's episode, I am honestly upset that I have to wait a week for the next episode. LOL       SO, now you know what I think about the show. What do you think? And better yet, Who on the show (past and present) do you think you relate to the most? ME? I relate to John Locke the most. Can't wait to hear your answers..

20090307114324AAdr1zP	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Help on Junior High Dance! Easy 10 points!?	Hi! I'm coordinating my junior high dance and need some help. so far, we have the following ideas for our theme "under the sea"-      1)Formal, not required for dress up, however!      2)Students can buy paper fishes ( at a dollar) and draw on them, sign name, etc. Later, these can go on a blue wall.      3)At top of gym, have blue, yellow, green, pink, and orange colored lights that will move around      4)Have a projection of some fish swimming around...      5)Bleachers covered in blue shimmery fabric and basketball hoops covered in fish net (party store)      6)Floor covered in blue and silver tinsel or string      7)At the ends of the gym, there can be blue shimmery fabric on top of some soft flashlights. Seaweed, and fish net can also be added      8)Fish cookies, blue punch, pizza, blue cotton candy is on the list for food items!      9)Outside, carnival games related to ocean such as “Barnacle basketball’ or “starfish toss” outside. Admission doesn’t cover, 25 cents a game, can earn candy (chaperones for this!)      10)Backdrop of mermaid for photos in MPR       11)Raise price of admission by 1 dollar       12)DJ could definitely play all requested songs, each 50 cents, with a name and personalized message.       13)Overall, the dance should be bright and fun      14)bubble machine       15)Crepe paper (green) for seaweed and green, blue, yellow, pink, orange balloons in each corner of room (spread freely) can get pack at dollar tree or party supply store      16)Anchor- in one of the corners!      17)Coral Archway- Great for the entrance into the dance floor!!!!       Questions-   1) We were decided whether to rent a sno cone or cotton candy machine...which would be better for the dance?   2) Any other ideas????

Right now, here in Tulsa, we spend just over $600 a month for about a 715 sq ft. 2 bedroom apt.       We want to move somewhere close to San Diego, but maybe not right in the middle of the city. And maybe a little more inland.       Also, what are the job prospects like in Southern California right now? Part of the reason we are leaving Oklahoma is because I have a college degree and the best job I can find is working in a gas station.

Ugh...I've decided that alarm clocks are the most annoying things on this planet. I hit the snooze button, desperately trying to delve back into the dream I was having about, sigh, him… After a while, frustrated, I flipped off my polka-dot covers and got out of bed. I walked, half-asleep, to the bathroom to wash my face. As the water heated up, I had a half a second of time to think. Mason…Just the thought of him set my heart racing 100 miles and hour. I picked up my pink wash cloth when the water was done heating up and began to wipe off my morning face. “Annalee! Are you almost done, sweetie?” my mom called from downstairs. “Yeah!” I yelled. I wrung out the wash cloth and hung it up on the edge of the tub to dry then started down the stairs. I’d leave my pajamas on and get dressed later. Yessss, chocolate Pop-tarts, I thought as I eyed the box on the counter. I grabbed a couple and threw them in the toaster then poured myself a glass of milk. I sat down at the counter and realized that I had almost fallen asleep waiting when my Pop-tarts popped up in the toaster. I ate quickly so I would have enough time to make myself look presentable.         Any suggestions? Don't be too harsh, please. This is a garbage draft (the even lower form of a rough draft). Thanks!

20090307135449AA2zksp	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Did I overreact in this situation.....?	Today I was getting my haircut and my dad got a phonecall from my sister saying that our mom was very sick at the mall and she called the ambulance. My dad and I drove over there and I ran to the girls bathroom where she was at. I got kicked out at first but then the nurse and security guard let me in and I saw my mom laying up against the wall crying holding her stomach and half conscious. I basically freaked out and started balling my eyes out with my sister. While they were carrying her on the stretcher I was telling her how much I loved her and they let me ride in the ambulance with her. The whole time I was just crying and telling her how everything was going to be okay. When we were at the hospital I kept freaking out the whole time and asking nurses to help. They have her stabilized and my dad took my sister and me home. Did I overreact? Because I wish I could have been stronger for my dad and my sister but I really thought I lost my mom at one point...heck I still might and I'm freaking out.

20090307145405AA9Jz0p	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Does it sound like my business partner is taking advantage of me?	Some of you know that my wife* and I run the Abandoned Squirrel Society. (A.S.S.)-  a non profit shelter for displaced or low impact hit and run accident survivors.      Since the stimulus package awarded us a great deal of money to carry on this great institution, we decided to take on a local businessman to help with the day to day operations.  My wife* and I went on a goodwill search looking for more helpless animals.  We traveled to Bermuda, Key West, the Cayman Islands, Aruba and many other tropical islands in this gut wrenching search.  I am sorry to say, we were not able to return with them. Unbeknownst to us, Carnival Cruise lines has a rule about bringing animals on board.       But back to my original problem. Our partner, Lil' Donng ,runs a chinese eatery in town.  Lately, his business has tripled in size. Word on the street is that his new menu features some of the most exotic dishes ever created.  I was very happy for him, until I recently visited the shelter and found only 2-3 dozen squirrels.  Normally at this time , there are hundreds in the shelter waiting for spring release.        Even more disturbing was the fact he traded our Tahoe in for a Mini Cooper.      I was like " Donng, Donng, where is my automobile?"         He stated that we no longer needed the bigger truck since the animals were shipped directly to the restaurant.     So my question to you, is  30% a big enough cut on the restaurants profits? My wife* says at least 40%.

He's got some growing up to do for sure, but I think he can do it. I want to see him and Chloe together.

20090307131307AAHBplS	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	If parents in the U.S. had a choice of sending their kids public or private schools, what would they choose?	In the United States, parents have a choice on if they want to send their children to a public school or a private school to get their K-12 education. If they send them to public school, they pay for it through their tax dollars but if they send them to a private school, they have to pay for tuition.      In your opinion, do you believe if parents had a choice on if their children went to school, would they choose a public school or a private school?      I believe most parents would send their children to a private school because private schools have better benefits suchs as smaller class size, school safety, class curriculum and they know where they money is spent.

20090227090230AA9bF1R	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Does anyone else think that the Joker would have been scarier if his plans weren't so convoluted?	Think about it, in the first bank robbery, there just happened to be a line of school buses waiting for his bus.  How could you get it that well timed or count on that happening.  And even if that did happen, is it unreasonable to assume somebody would probably notice that one of the school buses coming out of a big hole in the wall in the bank.  How the hell would the Joker have the foresight to put a finger print on that bullet Batman examines to lead him to a certain point.  Also, how'd did the Joker plant a burning fire truck in the middle of a street without anyone noticing or know that the police would be dumb enough to change their route to a much more dangerous one.  How did the Joker know to put the bomb in the guy and how did he know he would get caught.  How the hell did he move all those explosives onto the boats with absolutely no one noticing.  It's not a question of how rich or how far ahead of time he planned it, it's question of how 100's of barrels of nitroglycerin were moved into one location without anyone raising an eyebrow.  This was all done by someone who supposedly "doesn't have a plan."  Not that Heath Ledger wasn't good, but the plans were just so complex and unlikely that it took away his menace.  I know it's a comic book movie, but it's one that totes itself as a more realistic batman.  Now just as a contrast, look at Anton Chigurh, the bad guy from no country for old men.  His plans were creative (i.e. the pneumatic gun) but simple and effective.  That's what made him so menacing and it's why he haunts my nightmares every night.

I went to Walmart the other day with a friend, and ran in to grab something while she waited in the car. As i was walking to find the right aisle of what i was looking for, i saw this guy sitting on a bench in the store, and walked past him. I noticed when i walked past him, that he looked at me up and down a couple times, and checked me out i guess you could say? Than had a big smile on his face. He clearly knew i saw him, but i just ignored it and walked away. I just thought it was really rude, and it kinda grossed me out. As a female, if i see a cute guy i dont just stare at him up and down like a piece of meat. So if this happens when i go places, should i just ignore it or say something?

All I remember was this young teenage girl with curly golden/black hair who kept watching this guy and she would call him and then hang up (I think). I remember her being stuck in the back of his car or trunk once. This dude she was stalking turned out to be a nut and one time she called him and he picked up and she asked him out on a date (and I don't remember if he agreed or disagreed on it) But all I remember is that this girl lived with her single mother and her mother was constantly behind her back about doing things. Well anyways..at the end of the movie I remember the mother and daughter fighting off the madman because he somehow entered their house (the house was filled with candles btw) and I think the mother/daughter threw him outside of the appartment bedroom window. And that's how it ended.      I think this was a lifetime movie but I'm not sure. sorry if the description is confusing, I can only remember bits and pieces. please help me figure out this movie. thanks.
20090307125746AAOEFd6	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What movie is this, It's from the 80's, had a yoda looking guy in it?	I think it was from the 80's.  It had a little yoda looking guy in it, as well as guys with long hair straight from the 80's who were dressed like mad max.   The movie was based around a thing called a "key" I think, which was this cylinder that had keys on it, when pressed made musical notes, that had some importance. It was a futuristic movie I think. Please help me out, it's been bugging me for a long time!

Yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. Why do you suppose that is?"      "Jeez," said the stranger. "I have no idea."      "Well, then," said Little Johnny, "How is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know sh*t?"

What's Next? A German company called Optimal Media Production makes a variety of novelty CDs. Could one of these be the next big musical format?      1...The Freestyle Disc. Utilizing the CD player's laser - reading function   , this disc makes full - color, 3 - D images float through the room, as the music plays      2.The Perfume Disc. A Scent is enbedded in the disc, and when the CD player shines a laser light on the disc to play the music a pleasing aroma is released.      3..The Vinyl - Look Disc.  It's a CD that plays on standard CD players, but it's made out of black Polycarbonate. Result: it looks and feel like a tiny, old fashioned recor.      4....The Vinyl Disc. One side is a CD, Flip it over and you can play it on a record player [if you still have one].      which of the four would love to own, if any at all.    I like the Freestyle Disc.

20090307161634AA1Z20u	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How Much Would Someone Have to Weigh For You to Consider Them 'Fat'?	To me, it really depends on proportion. A girl who is 5'5 and 150 could indeed look thinner then someone who is 5'5 and 135, if proportioned right. I was 5'5, 150 lbs before I got pregnant and while I wasn't skinny, I wasn't fat. I was average. When I think of fat, I think obese(taking up more than one seat obese).      I also hate when people who are around my height and 120 lbs complain about being fat.  :/

20090307162836AAxh8sW	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Funny joke..........?	A male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen mask over his mouth and nose, still heavily sedated from a difficult four hour, surgical procedure. A young student nurse appears to give him a partial sponge bath.      "Nurse", he mumbles, from behind the mask. "Are my testicles black?"      Embarrassed, the young nurse replies "I don't know, Sir. I'm only here to wash your upper body and feet."      He struggles to ask again, "Nurse, are my testicles black?"      Concerned that he may elevate his vitals from worry about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment and sheepishly pulls back the covers. She raises his gown, holds his penis in one hand and his testicles in the other, lifting and moving them around.      Then, she takes a close look and says, "There's nothing wrong with them, Sir !!"      The man pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her and says very slowly,      "Thank you very much. That was wonderful, but listen very, very closely......      A r e - m y - t e s t - r e s u l t s - b a c k ? "

20090307163040AAPMoxi	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Question about Watchmen?	I went to buy tickets today, and since I'm 17, they wouldn't sell it to me, so I sent my 'rents to pick some up for my friends and I.  I'm just worried that, though we have the tickets, we'll get stopped and asked for ID?  Though, I'm hoping it's a bit busy, so they don't look over everything.      I've read the book a few times, so I know what it's about, and I know there's violence and nudity, but that's life.  I would just be pissed if we got stopped, as I've been looking forward to seeing this movie in theatres for months.      So, what do you think?  Think we'll be okay, or will I have to try and look older (which is impossible as they still ask if I'm a child).

I suppose I like all types of music from Britney Spears to Carolina Liar. My playlist only consists of basically the good songs of Ashlee Simpson (La la la, Didn't steal your boyfriend, pieces of me), fast songs of Beyonce, loveee Britney Spears' old ones like (Stronger, & Everytime), Forever the Sickest Kids is pretty good, Hedley, Jason Mraz, Leona Lewis, Making April, Relient K, Click Five, The Fray, and Yellowcard. I'm looking for a new obsession of a group, or person that my friends haven't heard of, just because I like being able to have favorite songs that no one has heard of so they can't sing them with me, hah. (: If you could include which band or person the new artist resembles, that would be awesome too. Thanks! (Ps. it doesn't have to be a new band just created or noticed, just a band that I've probably never heard of, maybe got lost between the new stuff! Thanks again)

20090307164010AAAqlve	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What do you think this song means?	blind winter by missy higgins      It was a blind winter when she headed off,   written on her head was "failure to conform"   She had her left hand apon a stick but she'd had enough   so she threw away her one way home.      She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go."   She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go..."      It was a black winter night as she stumbled on   and with every step grew closer to the ground.   She knew her one chance of living on was to strip away   [ Find more Lyrics on www.mp3lyrics.org/994s ]   all the colours that were casting her astray.      She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go."   She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go..."      So with a fever of 43 she surrendered there,   ready for the world to take her as their own.   But as she lay there the people stared as they carried on,   feeling terrified of her stripped to the bone...      She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go."   She said "I'm just another girl who wants to know   just where you think it's written down,   this way that we should go..."      I'm trying to think of something and all I am coming up with is, she's afraid to conform, she doesnt want what everyone is pushing on her. And as she's falling, and failing she's still willing to fight, and even though she's broken and afraid while people pass her she still won't give up.   Is anyone else coming up with that conclusion??

Since first reading the mini series as a 12 year old in 1987, to rereading the graphic novel yesterday, I've never been able to shake the feeling that while Watchmen is sort of an enjoyable read, it's far from the work of work of genius everyone seems to revere.       Even when I was 12, I thought the dystopian nihilism of Watchmen was a pretty hackneyed setting. I've always found the tone and messages to be pretty cliche, and have never understood why it's always praised for its originality.       And while the mystery story is enjoyable , I've never found much emotional resonance in the characters and their stiff, overly expositional and awkward dialog.      Anyway, I think it's a decent book, but nowhere near being the best comic ever created--But after asking dozens of friends over the years, I've never encountered anyone who found Watchmen to be less than total genius.       Is there anyone else out there who isn't on the Watchmen bandwagon?      (again, I'm referring to the comic, not the movie)

20090307162551AAQqrGf	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Does Chris Brown/Rhianna case shows a double standard?	As a male I see domestic violence as being wrong.  If Chris Brown attacked out of self defense then he deserves what sentence is handed out.  However the problem I have is thatsociety seems to see violence against women as more severe as men. Two excuses are men are stronger than women.  Two women are more emotional than men.  However not all men are stronger than women and when women use or throw objects it can hit as hard or harder as men.  Two I dont buy the emotional excuse by women.  If women are more emotional than men then they should not be allowed to be not to get as much top positions as men in jobs or politics.  I am sorry if you disagree with me but what is good is for thegoose should be good for the gander.

We have always wanted to go to one of his shows together, but unfortunately have never been able to. We live in Georgia. I heard that Toby is going to do another tour called the "That Don't Make Me A Bad Guy" tour. I was very excited to find that one of the shows would be on a Friday, May 15, at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in Charlotte, NC. Since this would be a weekend and I wouldn't have school, my dad and I decided we would go. However, when I searched for tickets, I found that George Strait was performing there on this night. It said Julianne Hough and Blake Shelton would open for George. I checked, but I didn't see anywhere that said Toby was included in George's opening acts, however, I did find somewhere that Julianne was opening on a few of Toby's shows as well. I found that all of the dates listed for Toby's upcoming tour are exactly the same as George's (and at the same place). Does anyone know anything about this? Any info would be appreciated as we would really love to see Toby! Thanks!

Do you feel cheated that he chose the UK over the USA?       It's just that I was watching a video on youtube, by 'The Skorpion Show' and a guy called Makel said he felt cheated because he thinks he should perform in his home country or around the world ... not just London.      I can personally understand why he's performing here, because of all the false allegations etc and bad publicity in the US but what are your opinions? This question is especially for the Americans!

20090307172823AAfYXd5	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Is it illegal to resell music that you cannot buy anymore? Rare Underground Rap Music?	I have a lot of rips that are remastered from original cassettes rap tapes from the 1990s. From all underground rappers, that all do not rap anymore. They were never sold in any Walmart, Circuit City, Fye, Best Buy or any big retailers. Only sold in the city they where made in , in like local car audio shops and music stores. They are impossible to buy now or find online unless you download them off of forums, and they aren't remastered. I bought the remastered rips off a friend, who remastered them himself. Most of these rap tapes were made at home. And I was wondering if it is illegal to resell them, but as remastered on audio cassettes? Like I said they are impossible to buy anymore (og tapes, non remastered), and you would be 100% lucky if you went to the town they were made in and actually found one or any of them in the places they were sold in, now about 11 -20 years later from when they were made.
