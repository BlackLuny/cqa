20090227120827AAMLyrL	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Three Network mobile phone theft repair centre. Why cant they just give me back my phone?	I booked my k660i for repair.  the day(wednesday 18feb09) it was being collected, i was not at home and instead of my k660i, my unlocked N73 was sent(with a 3 simcard in it).   I quickly alerted 3 about this and they said they would send the phone by friday 20feb 09.   Nothing came on friday. I called and the agent on the phone said it in the repair but they would dispatch it for delivery. Saturday I called and talked to another agent who took my case and said he would get back to me in 3days, meaning on tuesday.   it was me who kept calling them. then i called on monday, they said its being investigated. it takes 3days.  They didnt even contact to tell me they lost my phone, bastards!   then that saturday agent called on wednesday saying they cant do anyfing unless i provide the IMEI number.  I dont have the IMEI number since I bought it on ebay and I already asked the seller and he doesnt have it.   Ok..i appreciate the fact that they wont find a nokia n73 out of mayb a million n73 coming at their one single repair centre(only if they have 1 million customers in one region, LOL), and it would be difficult to find a phone without a IMEI number.   OK, BUT my n73 had a sim card in it.  A sim card has a UNIQUE number which should thus prove that out of those so called one million N73, my N73 is present as well.   on top of that, its unlocked with O2 software still embedded in it.   These details do provide them with some sense and logic to understand that my N73 is there in the repair centre.   Why cant they just grab it and give it to me?   I paid ￡65 for that phone and they are giving ￡20 credit only!   WTF?   I want my phone, not the stupid ￡20 credit!   The parcel company has a consignment number which shows that the phone was sent to the repair centre and IT IS WITH THREE.   It is a case of theft, I have sent an item with a reference + my sim, the item is delivered, they have it and now they claim to have lost it and wont give it to me unless i give the IMEI, ridiculous!      What would you do if you were in my position?

20090227160254AAKK0Nz	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Do you really like your SLR camera?	Hi! Ok, so I'm starting to think seriously about purchasing one, I have a stupid little point and shoot right now. To be honest, I never use it. I think the pictures come out crummy and I feel like it's a burden to be taking the pictures (almost like I'm ruining the moment for myself and all I get out of it is a stupid picture that is blury and I don't even want to look at). I've been considering an SLR (I've never used one before) and am starting to seriously think about buying one. My question is how much do you really like your SLR? If I'm going to buy one I want to almost be addicted to it, and have to have it by me at all times to take pictures. It's a lot of money and in the past I have spent decent amounts of money on technology that I rarely use. I just don't want this to be the case. I don't want to just take it out on a special occassion, I want to really love it and use it all the time. Odviously, there's no way of telling if this will happen, which is why I'm asking. What was your experience?      Thanks for any help, it's alot of money and I really want to think about before spending. Sorry the question was so long!!

20090227154556AAifJ1w	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 scratched game question...?	I just got a 60 gb Xbox on Monday. I also got Skate (1) and Halo 3 (both new). I've been playing Skate, and all of a sudden the Hellavator area and outside of the train stations are weird. I tried to play it today and it froze on the loading screen in the very beginning. I see a ringed scratch (just one) around the whole thing. How could this have happened? I didn't move the Xbox while the game was playing, and I definitely didn't scratch it with anything. Since I got it Monday, can I return it to GameStop?      Thank you for answering any of my questions.

When we turn on the TV and coverter box,it shows up this menu to set up channels and check your antenna, ao we did that and the antenna said that it was weak. So, we got out of the menu and put it to where it would show the picture, If it was working and it says, No Signal. We've done moved the antenna, which was rabbit ears, done tried the other too. We've tried unpluging cord, putting them in different places and putting them back where it goes. I've done everything. Any ideas? Is it where we are living at that we're not getting any signal? I live in the Mountain State, the Northern East coast. I need your help! Sorry so long! Thanks though! =)

20090227162636AADudUF	Consumer Electronics;Home Theater	I have a weird picture issue on my HDTV & PS3. Please help.?	Hi everyone.      I wonder if you offer any advice for a picture issue I have with my TV.      When I watch a Blu-Ray movie I get this really weird fuzziness that appears around people. Its almost like a halo that appears around them. Its only obvious when the people on screen are walking and it only happens for a split second, though its obvious enough to spoil the viewing pleasure of a movie. I have a full 1080 HDTV, PS3, and an Onkyo 606 Receiver.    I also have SKY HD, and Apple TV (which I watch HD shows through)  and this never happens when watching these.   So I am trying to find out if its a setting on the PS3, or HDMI cables, or maybe something else.   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. I hope I have made sense with what I am asking.

I guess that's what I get for falling for a fancy dancy cheaper version of  a blackberry so I could pretend I was cool phone.      Anyone else have any dash problems?

20090225102009AAdae62	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	AT&T contract question.?	i bought into a 2 year contract with AT&T a year ago. i quickly decided the BlackJack 2 wasn't the phone for me and returned it, keeping my old CellularOne phone.      recently, i had a rep mention to me that by taking that BJ2 back and NOT getting another phone with my new contract discount, I shouldn't be under contract at all; said I SHOULD be month-to-month. this isn't the case as my account states that my contract has an "end date" (next January).       can you help me with solving this? do i have a leg to stand on in trying to get out of my contract (which is a little more pricey than i want for my old phone that can't send/ receive date or pics)?      thanks.

I think some of the songs on my iPod are malware, or some other sort of infection, and I want to put the songs back on my PC so I can put it on a CD and then remove it from my PC, so i can still listen to it on a CD player and if it is infected can it affect my stereo or CD player? I'm using Windows Media Player for this because iTunes is B.S., but not sure how to do it, if anyone can help, I'd appreciate it.

20090225103503AAYDgNm	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	Help Needed Buying SD Memory Cards?	I want to buy some new memory cards for new digital camera (a Panasonic FZ50.) I know that I want them to be 8Gb SDHC but I'm not sure what brand to buy.      I can go for the Sandisk Extreme 3 SD or the Transcend brand. Both are class 6, SDHC, and 8Gb. But the Transcend one is less than half the price of the Sandisk.      I was wondering if there was any real advantage going for the more expensive brand. I wouldn't mind paying more if it was better, but I'm not sure what the difference is.      Any advice ???
