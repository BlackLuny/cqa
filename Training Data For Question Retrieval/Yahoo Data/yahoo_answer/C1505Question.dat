20090304091828AA3yR62	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Questions on Jesus???	I was reading an article on Jesus to know whether Jesus was a liar or not and there I found something that hit my mind.      In John 8:29 Jesus said      29 And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.      But at the time of His death on cross, He cried out, saying "My God, My God, Why have you forsaken me?"      So if He knew that the Father was about to leave Him at the time of His death, why did Jesus say so in John 8:29      Also when He was accused of breaking the Sabbath, He said that His Father was always at work till then. But in Genesis we see that God took rest from His work on the 7th day. What did Jesus actually mean to say?

20090304092941AALDDeL	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: If Sahih Bukhari has only Sahih Hadiths then why do you deny them?	Urwa b. Zabair reported that 'Abdullah b. Zubair (Allah be pleased with him) stood up (and delivered an address) in Mecca saying: Allah has made blind the hearts of some people as He has deprived them of eyesight that they give religious verdict in favour of temporary marriage, while he was alluding to a person (Ibn 'Abbas). Ibn Abbas called him and said: You are an uncouth person, devoid of sense. By my life, Mut'a was practiced during the lifetime of the leader of the pious (he meant Allah's Messenger, may peace be upon him), and Ibn Zubair said to him: just do it yourselves, and by Allah, if you do that I will stone you with your stones.   Sahih Muslim, Book 008, Number 3261      Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325:      Narrated 'Aisha: (mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle.      Ibn Abbas:      "The Messenger of God said bring me a tablet (lawh) and an inkpot (dawat), so that I can write for you a document, after which you will not go astray ... Some people said that The Messenger of God was talking deliriously".      But, even though Muhammad was unable to write his will because of the commotion, he did get three statements out:      "Then the Prophet ordered them to do three things saying, 'Turn out all the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates by giving them gifts as I used to do.' " The sub-narrator added, "The third order was something beneficial which either Ibn 'Abbas did not mention or he mentioned but I (the narrator) forgot.(see second link from reference 1).      When Umar claimed that there was no need for Muhammad's statement since the Muslims had the Qur'an, Ibn Abbas allegedly rushed out crying. There he met Ubaidullah ibn Abdullah. According to him, Ibn Abbas used to say,      '"No doubt, it was a great disaster that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise."      1. ^ Sahih Bukhari, 70.573   2. ^ Tarikh al-Tabari, Volume 9 translated by Ismail.

Whoa..what? Yes I am from a neighborhood where people speak with an dialect that people like to call Ebonics or AAVE. I am a Sophomore in college! I have clearly had the teachings of English and Grammar while in school. I speak this way because it's the way the people in my family speak. It has nothing to do with how well I read and write. A person never asks a Harvard graduate who still speaks with a deep Southern accent, why they speak that way. People call those type of people uneducated as well. When will we learn that dialects, accents and the place we live (sometimes) does not determine our education level and where we end in life? Also, I do change my speaking style from when I am at home to being in an environment like work, school, or in public! It's a shame I have to hide my natural accent while being in public because of a fear of being called ignorant. Plus, being from Chicago on top of my inner city accent, I might as well be speaking another language.       Also, with my dad being from Alabama, he brought his accent up here and I caught on to some of his accent so it's all just a huge blur..lol. Thanks people.

20090304094006AAECeXD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I want to be open minded about Catholicism?	I have met some very nice Catholics who love Jesus, but I have a couple of questions that I can't get real clear answers to.       1. In the Bible, Jesus said not to call anyone on earth "father" or "rabbi" because there is but one Father and one Teacher. It was in a spiritual context, so as far as I know, it wasn't referring to natural fathers. In other words, why do Catholics disregard this and call priests "father" regardless?       2. Jesus told us not to pray as the heathen, who use vain repetitions. I realize Catholics are asking intercession, not praying to Mary. However, how is "Hail Mary" not a vain repetition, especially when you're told to say a certain number of them (repeat them)?       3. Every instance of baptizing believers in the Bible occurred after they believed and involved immersion, which is why they sought out bodies of water big enough to immerse people in for baptism. If it is symbolic of dying to self and being alive in Christ, then shouldn't they be buried in the water fully and raised up out of it? Only believers were allowed to be baptized. How can a baby believe?       4. What Scriptural basis is there for purgatory?       5. Jesus said that if anyone wants to be great, he should be our servant. The Pope is adorned in fine clothing, accepts praise from men, and sits on a throne. Is that Scriptural?      6. This one's more of a random question, and I don't claim it to be true, but I'm curious. In Revelation, some kind of religious system is being condemned. They are described as wearing purple and scarlet. Does that have any correlation to this?  http://kenraggio.com/archbishopscardinal...        Thanks.
20090304093152AAL2zw4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I desire the Sweetness Jesus! How do I go about getting it or changing?!?	I was once always called a sweetheart. Over the past few years, and after being treated poorly and having some heartbreaks…I feel I have become a little withdrawn or bitter. I want to be sweet again! I am dating such a sweet amazingly soft and sensitive man, and I am a little worried that my recent “protective cold heartedness” might hurt him. Plus, I want my sweet self back! How can I have the Love of God help change me and bring back sweet selflessness?

However, I feel like he should compensate me in some way, and since the sex wouldn't cost him anything, it's not like I'll be taking advantage of the situation.  Should I just proposition him or wait until the time is right and tell him to give it up or else take his own mom to dialysis?

20090304071455AA2FEaG	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;People with Disabilities	When accusing my lawyer of doing probono work consider this please?	A lawyer that specializing in SSI and SSDI claims is technically a pro-bono lawyer. People who apply are typically poor with little resources. So they can't afford a "normal lawyer". A Disability lawyer gets paid by taking a small portion (normally 1/4) of your backpay. So this is the reason why if you don't or have very little chance of qualifying for SSI or SSDI a lawyer normally will not take your case.       So in other words, I have faith that the lawyer I picked to represent me knows what he's doing. Typically, most people are rejected twice before receiving payments. My lawyer told me 90% of people are rejected for a second time, I'm currently on my third try and awaiting for a hearing date to be set.      I personally knew someone with scizophrenia once that it took about 5 years to get his SSI and on average it'll take 3 or 4 times. Sometimes it can take years.

So it makes me think and wonder, if you aren't Asian do you generally know that a lot of East Asia is probably the only large part of the world that is non-religious, agnostic, and atheistic?      I'm sure that there is a lot of problems with government/economic development that needs to be fixed but otherwise we seem to be on the right track?

I am afraid there will be drama and kind of said that... but she insisted that she would be cool. I know that she will get to the party and will stay at my side all night complaining about the girlfriend. I just want to have a good time with my guy and his friends, I don't want drama.

20090304075559AA5WHQ4	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Abdullah bin sabaa the jew founder of shiites sect ; complete story (by there own words)?	'ABDULLAH IBN SABA - FOUNDER OF SHI'ISM      There have been a growing tendency amongst modern Shi`ah scholars to dismiss the role of `Abdullah ibn Saba (sometimes called ibn Sauda) of San'a, a city of Yemen, in the origin of Shi'ism debate. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, the modern Shi'ah state now wishes to ground its origins on something more concrete, rather than upon the mischief of Jew, in order to gain official recognition as a legitimate Islamic state amongst Muslims.      Upto the classical age of Shi'ism, all of the erudite Shi'ite scholars attributed the origin of Shi'ism to this same ibn Saba. `Allamah Majlisi said: "Some scholars have asserted that ibn Saba was a Jew who accepted Islam and started voicing his opinion of the `wilayat' (divine appointment) of `Ali. While a Jew, he propounded the exaggerative notion that Yusha ibn Nun was divinely appointed to succeed Prophet Musa, he thus adopted a similar stance with regard to `Ali in relation to the Holy Prophet. He was the first to subscribe to the belief of Imamate, and he openly vitriolated his enemies (i.e. the first three Caliphs) and branded them as infidels. The origin of Shi'ism is thus based on Judaism." (Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 25, p. 287). Other Shi`ah scholars who have affirmed this was `Allamah Kashi in his Rijal al-Kashi and `Allamah Mamaqani in his Tanqih al-Maqal.      Amongst Sunni scholars, `Allamah ibn Taimiyyah had confirmed this in his Minhaj al-Sunnah. He wrote: "More than one Shi`ah scholar have affirmed that that the first one to start disparaging the Sahabah and who introduced the doctrine of wilayah was a hypocrite and a zindiq who intended to corrode Islam from within. He wished to scheme as Baulus had schemed against Christianity. Prophet Jesus was raised to the heavens, and there were a precious few who followed his teachings. His teachings thus weakened the fabric of Christianity and many started adopting his exaggerated notions and many kings were won over to their side. When their scholars tried to oppose them, they were killed, some were exiled, while some were confined to life-long sentences in remote monasteries. On the other hand, this ummah will always have a group of staunch followers who will uphold the truth. No corrupt person will be able to destroy Islam, he will only gain some followers." (Minhaj al-Sunnah, vol. 3, p. 261). `Allamah Shahristani has confirmed this too, saying that when `Ali heard the claim of his divinity directly from the mouth of ibn Saba, he exiled him to Mada'in (Al-Milal wa al-Nihal, vol. 2, p. 11).      Hafiz ibn Hajar threw more light on the dialogue between `Ali and ibn Saba on this occasion: "Abul Ijlas says that I heard `Ali telling `Abdullah ibn Saba: "By Allah, I have not hidden any secret from anyone which the Holy Prophet told me. I heard the Holy Prophet saying that there would appear thirty liars before the last day, and you are one of them." Once Suwaid ibn Ghafalah visited `Ali during his reign and told him that he had passed a few people amongst whom was ibn Saba speaking ill of Abu Bakr. They claimed that you also held the same opinion." `Ali retorted: "I have nothing to do with this black filthy creature. I seek refuge from Allah that I hold any opinion other than the best for Abu Bakr and `Umar." He then exiled ibn Saba saying that he could not tolerate to live with him in one city. `Ali then ascended the pulpit, and after relating the story said: "I will lash anyone who prefers me over Abu Bakr and `Umar, the lashing of a slanderer." (Lisan al-Mizan, vol. 3, p. 290).      Beliefs of Ibn Saba in a nutshell      `Ali was divinely appointed to be the Holy Prophet's successor, and that `Ali had hid this knowledge from the people.      He later called for the divinity of `Ali. Having said so, he proclaimed himself as `Ali's Prophet. Even Shi`ah scholars have gawked at his audacity. He initially did not openly preach these beliefs, but he later abandoned his secret and started a vigorous campaign. (Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 25, p. 286)      He preferred `Ali over Caliph Abu Bakr, `Umar and `Uthman, saying that they usurped the Caliphate form `Ali. He declared open enmity towards all those who did not subscribe to such a belief and branded them as kuffar.      His devious scheme      Speaking of the devious scheme which ibn Saba gradually implemented to achieve his aims, Shah `Abd al-`Aziz has written: "Ibn Saba first called the masses to show their love and devotion to the ahl al-Bait (Prophetic Household). He then started claiming that none could excel the ahl al-Bait in status. When he gained some popularity at this, he boldly claimed that `Ali was the most superior person after the Holy Prophet. When he saw that some of his followers had indeed believed him, he confided in them that `Ali was in reality the appointed successor of the Holy Prophet, but the Sahabah had usurped this right from him. He then unleashed a campaign of vilification against all the Sahabah, and the first three Cali

20090227061454AA6DePN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Am I racist? Or do I merely dislike racist people?	This is mainly involving blacks & whites.      I'm just a regular white guy and would like to think that I'm not racist. Whenever I see a black person or family, I don't get angry or wish them harm by any means. I know that our cultures and tastes are greatly different, but it doesn't bother me one bit.      My problem is this: The only time I really get upset is when I see entities like Fubu (For Us, By Us), BET (Black Entertainment Television), Black History Month, and Al Sharpton. These, imo, are what keeps this hidden animosity alive. I feel that a white guy like me is not wanted to participate/watch BET; Thus, I feel that I'm being racist for disliking such things.      I know that many white underground groups cause great negative heat. However, it's not publicized like Fubu, BET, and Shaprton's radio. Can you imagine what would happen if we had something like WET (White Entertainment Television)?      Does disliking such entities title me as a racist? Or does this merely mean I dislike racism in general?      Thanks!

She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house. You must purge the evil from among you.        22 If a man is found sleeping with another man's wife, both the man who slept with her and the woman must die. You must purge the evil from Israel.        23 If a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her, 24 you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death—the girl because she was in a town and did not scream for help, and the man because he violated another man's wife.

He sits alone and as far as I have seen, he is a loner.   I personally would not want anything to do with him either, but why do christians preach forgiveness yet when they are tested, they don't.   I am not a christian and I am not bashing christianity but I know for someone like this guy it would be hard to forgive but how do you cope with forgiving someone who is a convicted sex offender?

Salam,      please don't take this as a "bashing" type of question, just wondering.....      why is it that sunni books are full of hadiths narrated by Hathrat Ayesha, Abu Hurraira and Abdullah Ibne Umar, but they have so little hadiths narratedd by Imam Ali (as), or Bibi Fatima (as), or Imam Hasan (as) and Imam Hussain (as)?      i mean even since Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) said "I am the City of Knowledge and Ali (as) is it's Gate", why is it that the knowlede of this Holy Person isn't bein used so much in sunni books?   didn't Imam Ali (as) benefit enought from Prophet Mohammad (PBUH&HF)?      and wasn't Imam Ali (as) the only person who asked people to ask him any questions they have as long as they haven't lost him?      so why is it that in sunni books, the hadihs which are narrated by Ayesha and others are a lot and the hadiths narrated by these Holy People are so little?      Peace.

Many religions teach that if you don't follow THEIR specific teachings you are going to burn forever in hell. For example, if someone followed the Southern Baptist doctrine as opposed to the Roman Catholic doctrine, that person would go to hell according to the Catholic teachings and vice versa. In addition to so called 'Christian' religions, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and most other religions have a version of hell to strike fear in the hearts of their laity. This has always been my biggest beef with the fire and brimstone crowd.
20090304085144AARLYQS	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you prefer? A hard truth, or a comforting fantasy?	Personally I'll take a hard, bitter truth over a comforting fantasy any day of the week.   Take the fantasy of Heaven for example. Here we have a happy, comforting make believe land where, after we die, we get to see our mommies and daddies again. Perhaps meet a grandpa who died before we were born. Maybe meet a famous actor or astronaut you always admired. And that's just 10 minutes after signing the guest-book!   But the hard reality is that there is no such place. No more so than there is an Oz or a Narnia or a Hell.   When we die, the electrical activity in our brains cease. And everything we've ever done, seen, felt, heard, wished ect becomes as so much rotten meat.    Some of you will take this negatively. Don't. I find it to be a good motivator for me to leave this place a bit better than I found it.      So? How about it? Hard truth, or comfortable fairy tale?

Sahih Bukhari Volume 4, Book 53, Number 325:      Narrated 'Aisha: (mother of the believers) After the death of Allah 's Apostle Fatima the daughter of Allah's Apostle asked Abu Bakr As-Siddiq to give her, her share of inheritance from what Allah's Apostle had left of the Fai (i.e. booty gained without fighting) which Allah had given him. Abu Bakr said to her, "Allah's Apostle said, 'Our property will not be inherited, whatever we (i.e. prophets) leave is Sadaqa (to be used for charity)." Fatima, the daughter of Allah's Apostle got angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude till she died. Fatima remained alive for six months after the death of Allah's Apostle.      Sahih al Bukhari Bab al Adab, Volume 8, Book 73, Number 100:      "Narrated Abu Aiyub Al-Ansari:   Allah's Apostle said, "It is not lawful for a man to desert his brother Muslim for more than three nights. (It is unlawful for them that) when they meet, one of them turns his face away from the other, and the other turns his face from the former, and the better of the two will be the one who greets the other first.".

The words used here 'Thanaza" -dispute will have significance later      Note: Do not dispute with Rasoolallah (saww)         Surah Nisa verse 59 "O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the Messenger, and those charged with authority among you. If ye differ in anything among yourselves, refer it to Allah and His Messenger, if ye do believe in Allah and the Last Day: That is best, and most suitable for final determination."      Surah Hashr verse 7 "And whatsoever the messenger giveth you, take it. And whatsoever he forbiddeth, abstain (from it). And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is stern in reprisal."      Ibn Abbas:      "The Messenger of God said bring me a tablet (lawh) and an inkpot (dawat), so that I can write for you a document, after which you will not go astray ... Some people said that The Messenger of God was talking deliriously".      But, even though Muhammad was unable to write his will because of the commotion, he did get three statements out:      "Then the Prophet ordered them to do three things saying, 'Turn out all the pagans from the Arabian Peninsula, show respect to all foreign delegates by giving them gifts as I used to do.' " The sub-narrator added, "The third order was something beneficial which either Ibn 'Abbas did not mention or he mentioned but I (the narrator) forgot.(see second link from reference 1).      When Umar claimed that there was no need for Muhammad's statement since the Muslims had the Qur'an, Ibn Abbas allegedly rushed out crying. There he met Ubaidullah ibn Abdullah. According to him, Ibn Abbas used to say,      '"No doubt, it was a great disaster that Allah's Apostle was prevented from writing for them that writing because of their differences and noise."      1. ^ Sahih Bukhari, 70.573   2. ^ Tarikh al-Tabari, Volume 9 translated by Ismail.

20090304091302AA1UuOW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If God knows everything and that includes the future, then wouldn't he have known?	First off, I am a Christian. Just throwing that out there. So I'm not some atheist trying to bash away at Christian ideals and ideas.       When God was creating the heavens and the earth and all that is and was, then wouldn't he have known from the very get go that his creation was going to be flawed to a degree? By that I mean that the humans that he would place upon the earth would 'soon,' (whatever amount of time that is) disobey him and fall from grace. From there sin would enter into the world and then we would get to where we are today and in order to correct this problem he would have to sacrifice his only son for our salvation.       However, since God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent, wouldn't have be able to know the future and see that there was going to be that problem? It seems to me that it was irresponsible of God to continue on his way and make the world, even though there was going to be flaws in it. Along with every other artist, would not God want his creation to be perfect? The Lord even took the 7th day to rest, after pronouncing that 'It was good.' Would he not have wanted it to stay good?       Technically any correction would not have infringed upon the whole free will thing because God would have been able to make the changes before our free will or even humanity itself came into existence.

20090227064118AAYmTBa	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why do you believe some whites find Gangsta Rap to be so fascinating?	I asked this in another group and I was hoping to get some good answers here. Not all Hip Hop is bad. As a white male, I listen to a little bit. But I prefer R&B, Rock, Pop, Jazz, and Reggae.      First off, in my opinion there are some whites who like to listen to Gangsta Rap because they feel that they are being open-minded by reaching out to black people who grew up poor and made it big despite being oppressed by society and their elders.      But truth is most rappers are not from the ghetto and never lived the life that they rap about. In other words, they are just playing a character and promoting the worse stereotypes of blacks. Read Cora Daniels book Ghetto Nation.      To me, whites do more harm than good by buying this stuff and watching some of these shows on BET like Original Gangster or shows like the one with that thug Chance on VH1.   Nearly 80% of the people who buy rap albums are white teens and the CEO's making the most money off this industry are often white or Jewish.      For example, 50 cent, a guy many whites praise, dropped out of high school and said in an interview that he only went to school to show off his new clothes and not to learn. Why does society support people like him who degrade an education?        And the thing that I find bizarre is how a lot of whites who buy Gangsta Rap are the same ones who have a problem with blacks who live in the ghetto on welfare and who are selling drugs on the street corners. The same whites who love Gamgsta Rap are also the same ones who take their kids out of public schools that they believe are too black or too ghetto.      So why are they supporting Gangsta Rap if they have a problem with these things?      As I said. I believe some of it is white guilt, some is peer pressure, and some are being brainwashed by the thug fantasy where they show these so-called thugs and hustlers living the good life with all these hot women. Sorry but most people who live that life do not get a ton of hot women and have a very stressful life.      There are better ways for whites to reach out to blacks.

I am 18 years old and i left school about 2 years ago when i was 16.   I never really hung out with people but i chatted to most people in my class its just it never really went further than class chat.   I stood on my own at breaks and went home from lunch but everyone still chatted to me in class. There was a few people who were unpopular below me and the odd person above me, i wasnt at all popular which tbh im cool with.   Anyway so i decided to set up a myspace and add people from school, people i chatted to etc. But i keep get emails from them asking who i am and do they know me. I have told them we went to the same school and they dont rememeber i even had to say to someone i sat beside them, which made me feel like an idiot.   I read on a friends website a quote "forget those who forgot you" does this sound wise? Should i just delete everyone and start a complete fresh with people who do remember me?   I want to become an actress but have no confidence (was shy quiet girl at school) and i seem to want it really bad and really want to see their faces if i make it big to see if they remember me then.

He screamed at me, and said I was disrespectful and inconsiderate, and should put it back where it belongs. He told me to put it back where it's supposed to be, but I said no, so he got me by the arm and dragged mre to where the aisle was, and made me put it there.

Most people went to church on Sunday's. The stores were closed on Sunday so there was no shopping or going out to eat. It was a day of worship and rest and visiting.How was your younger years?

20090304084920AAwtiUx	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why would someone enter my home just to steal papers?	Not ID theft in the conventional sense, since my net worth is below 0.      Some of my neighbors have been entering my apartment with a key and have stolen at least 50 percent of all my papers.  Apart from government tax forms, pay stubs and bills, there are also photographs and one illustration from a book I'd kept since I was 6, that I was looking to frame and display. I'm 50 now, and no longer have it.  That probably upsets me most of all.      I'm not worried about identity theft from a credit point of view, but I find it very disturbing that someone would be profiling me in this way.  Why would anyone do this?       Even a governing body would produce a warrant and come when I'm home?      I know they want to find anything to get me out so they can give this apt. to their own people... let me say at this point I am very quiet and keep to myself and don't bother anyone.  Yet just for putting my dishes away the other day, the police were called!      I spend my life online... who could I be bothering?  I'm into photography and graphic arts, it doesn't get any more interesting than that!      When I discovered what was going on, which amounts to a continuous exchange of documents back and forth up and down the street, I became terrified to leave my apt.  For the last few months, I have only been going out twice a month when I absolutely have to, and come right back within a couple of hours. Even in that short time, they were still coming in.  I also believe there is some kind of monitoring going on in here.      I've since had an alarm installed, there's an extra expense I didn't need, as I am currently unemployed. And, to tell you the truth, I still don't really feel secure.      Everyone thinks they're James Bond these days.      I am located in Montreal, Canada.  If anyone knows where I can get a free bug sweep, I'd really appreciate it.      I want to sue for harassment, but  feel I have to wait until I am formally confronted with something, because the proof I have is not enough yet.      There are too many of them who are in it together, against just me, although I have told everyone I know what is going on and that if some strange thing happens to me, where to look first.      If anyone has any advice... please.

But on the other hand, my friend john who has been one of my good friends since the 7th grade- who revealed to me sophomore year that he has always had feelings for me.

20090304094630AAhBsmS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	I like this girl but i dont know if she likes me back...?	In september, i noticed this girl (il call her A) kept looking at me. When i caught shed sometimes shyly smile when i looked away. We both know who each other are cos we go to the same school, but wed never spoke to each other or anything.   Then about a month later while this was still going on, me an her were put into the same group that we had to stay in for the whole day. I didn't know anyone in the group, and i was on my own. A was with her friend (i'll call her B). The teacher gave me the work for my group to do. Everyone chose what work they wanted to do, then A and B came and got the work and sat next to me. A spent the whole day only speaking with me and paying only attention to me.   The next time we were put in the same group, A did the same thing again. And when we had to sit down she seemed to make sure that she was next to me. When we were told to get into partners, she came and stood next to me.   Whenever i look at A, and her friends notice, one of them says somwething, and they all look. At the end of IT, A always looks at me.   Whenever we have History together, she sometimes looks behind her at me, then quickly looks away. Then at the end of History, when we walk downstairs and she is with B, she walks really slow so she is walking in between me and B.   Usually, when on the rare occasion we do get to talk to each other, she always plays with her hair.      In History the other day, we were allowed to sit where we want, and cos A was on her own i asked A to sit next to me. But the next day, when i got to lesson, she was sitting near where i would be, but on her own. I think it was because the desk she was sitting on had been moved. So i moved the desk back to where it was before and asked her if she wanted to sit there, and she did. Then later, my friend who was sitting next to me, started talkign with me about celebrities we think are hot (i didnt mention any girl celebs though). I asked A who she liked, and she said she didnt know.      I always notice her friends giving me wierd looks. I know that A must know or at least suspect i fancy her, especcialy as hermates seem to know whats going on. A and her friends are all quiet and dont seem bitchy.      What do you think?      How do i know that shes not just being friendly, not realising i like her in that way?

If the Bible is nothing more than made-up fairy tales (as mentioned repeatedly in R/S), how come this police officer said that he had seen a demon at police headquarters, lost 40 pounds in six months by fasting, and urinated on himself because he refused to stop praying to go to the bathroom?       http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1...

20090304103540AABC7nz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why Should I Trust God, After What Happened To Lucifer?	Christians often cite Ezekiel 28 as a description of Lucifer before he fell.      In this description Lucifer was the “cherub” that covered God’s glory.  He had built-in musical instruments that expressed the very glory of God.      If God created Lucifer, and God created you and me and everybody else.      And when God created Lucifer, I’m sure that Lucifer trusted God to some extent.      Lucifer was created with free-will.      The Bible says that sin was “found” in him – and immediately Lucifer was cast down and every imaginable horror and indignity was brought upon him.      Not only this, but 1/3 of the angels in Heaven apparently thought this was such an injustice that they joined Lucifer.        Every Heavenly creature was close to God – with Lucifer being the closest.      They saw God in a way that humans do not see God.  It was not through a ‘glass darkly’ rather more like face to face.      If GOD is so wonderful, fulfilling, completing, secure, safe, trustworthy, loving, then why?      What did Lucifer and 1/3 of the angels in Heaven see that made them CHOOSE something else?      GOD obviously made them.  God knew what the challenges of free-will would present.      “POOF!” all these Heavenly creatures suddenly appeared in Heaven.  They had jobs, like, Lucifer did, making music, etc…  I’m sure every job had something to do with praising God.      So God created beings, with Lucifer as an example, for the express purpose of GLORIFYING HIMSELF.      But something went wrong, didn’t it?  Suddenly, it became rather ridiculous doing this 24/7.  Because GOD put into these creatures this thing called FREE-WILL – (AND most important, that even though they had free will, they HAD to use it to PRAISE and WORSHIP GOD).      And the same is true today.  We were created - by God - with free-will also.  BUT the catch is, that we MUST use it the way GOD wants us to use it.      If free-will is the hallmark of God’s exemplary love for His creation, why is it that it is the sole instrument for every imaginable evil?  When God created free-will, did He not know all of the evil that would be spawned as a result?      If GOD merely demands eternal PRAISE and WORSHIP, why did He not simply create robots?  That way, GOD’s exemplary LOVE would not have caused so much suffering?      Is is not true that if you love something, you set it free?  Was Lucifer ever truly loved?  Was Lucifer set free, when Lucifer decided to use his free-will for something other than ceaseless praise of God?      It is my Biblical opinion that Lucifer and all the angels who used their free-will were not loved, or set free, but merely enslaved. (according to the Biblical narrative).      A man who is set free is nothing but a freed man – a dog, dragging a piece of chain behind him.      Can you explain this?

20090304111910AArFk73	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Lord Butters II - How does it feel that a gay man disproved your ridiculous and false theory?	This answer was provided by J.P.      Link -  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...       As a gay man and an atheist, I kinda need to stop you.      There is no evidence that homosexuality is genetically determined any more than there is evidence that homosexuality is chosen.      Please stop falling into the Nature Vs. Nuture trap. Any person with a basic education in psychology can tell you that very little is 100% Nature or 100% Nurture.      The results discovered so far indicate that there are certain genes that can contribute to a predisposition towards homosexuality or heterosexuality. There is no evidence that these genes are absolute, there is no evidence that you are born set one way or the other.      On the flip side, there is no evidence that you choose it. Indeed, the neurological evidence suggests that the physical structures in the brain that influence the orientation of the person finalize during the first 18 months of life and are generally non-maleable once formed.      What it boils down to is this:      Nature provides a push, environment provides the rest, and neither is the determining factor, nor is it a choice.

20090304105434AAKCC1i	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do Catholics believe it is possible to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?	I don't know much about Catholicism or their beliefs. I understand that Catholicism is technically the beginning the Church, but why do they believe that we need a priest to absolve us of sin? Don't they believe in having a one-on-one relationship with Jesus Christ? Can't we be forgiven of sin just by asking Jesus ourselves, instead of going through a "middle man". I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but what is the Catholics definition of Salvation? Do they believe in personally asking Jesus into their hearts as their personal Lord and Savior? Isn't that what we're all supposed to do? I'm a Protestant by "definition", but I find the beliefs so different and confusing in the Catholic faith from what I believe. I'm interested in how Christianity itself became so skewed and divided.    Also, do Catholics have a different Bible than Protestants? I heard that they aren't permitted to interpret the Scriptures themselves, only through a priest..is this true? I'm just curious, please no rude comments..I CAN"T TAKE IT TODAY!!!   LOL!

In no way did our dates show that i wanted to rush into anything...we spoke less and soon stopped talking.       A week ago he called and i returned his call. I explained how i was disappointed in his behavior and he once again apologized. we met for drinks.       During the time we were out i received several calls and texts from work, inquiries that i did NOT respond to. . I SIMPLY LEFT THE PHONE IN MY PURSE.      as we left, he said that we should call it a night...because clearly i wanted to be somewhere else. I said "ok" and walked off.      He called me in the AM, and i returned his call only to have him say it was an accidental call. 30 min later i received a text from him explaing that the call WAS intentional....but he was unsure of me. .       seriously...what am i supposed to do with all of that?!?!?

20090304094741AA7aFgB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: Baptism. What do Scriptures say about the importance & relevance of Baptism?	Do you believe the scriptural teachings or some other doctrine? Almost nobody teaches what scriptures teach about baptism these days… & Scriptures are full of teachings on the subject.      Examples of common things not taught in scriptures:   "I think or feel it’s just an outward sign... a ceremonial thing like hand washing."    or "I think or feel it's legalistic"...      I'm not interested in opinionations like these...       Scripture says there's a change of the law, an atonement according to the law not a doing away with the law… The man of lawlessness is not of God.   If the law is done away, then how’s it said there’s a judgment, or the love of many grow cold b/c lawlessness abounds… or according to what is there sin?      Heb 7:11-14    12 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a CHANGE also of the law.    13 For he of whom these things are spoken pertains to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.    14 For it’s evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.      I posted this question but received a high number of emails from people who could not answer it do to technical problems.   Some Scriptures already shared have been:   Acts 2:38 - ...be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins      Acts 22:16 - ...arise & be baptized, & wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord."      Mk 16:16 Whoever believes & is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned.      1 Pet 1:21 ...baptism doth also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:   &   2 Kings 5:10-14    10 & Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go & wash in Jordan seven times, & thy flesh shall come again to thee, & thou shall be clean.    11 But Naaman was wroth, & went away, & said, Behold, I thought, He will surely come out to me, & stand, & call on the name of YHWH his God, & strike his hand over the place, & recover the leper.    12 Are not Abana & Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash in them, & be clean? So he turned & went away in a rage.    13 & his servants came near, & spoke to him, & said, My father, if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing, would thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he says to thee, Wash, & be clean?    14 Then went he down, & dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: & his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, & he was clean.

That all there is, is life and nature and once it is over it is really over.  On top of that I saw how Christians and others on this board and in life acted.  And it was not at all in the way that Jesus and other “Spiritual” people told us to act when I was growing up.  So I realized that all “Spiritual religions” are really a joke and that no one even practices any of it any way.  That the Carnal side of humans always win out over the so called spiritual side, because in reality there is no spiritual side.      So to make a long story short I have since left my Christian lifestyle and have come to realize that I am an atheist in every way.  I also converted to Satanism which as every one knows is “Religious Atheism” and life worship.  So my question is has anyone else here ever been converted either from this board or maybe elsewhere?

20090304095923AA2liOn	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can anyone in their right mind equate homophobia with racism or sexism?	I love how people equate disapproval of homosexual conduct with racism or sexism, yet they seem to be forgetting one of the most common arguments against homosexuality, "Hate the sin, love the sinner." "Hate the sin, love the sinner" is NOT applicable to race or sex in ANY manner because there's no behavior involved in being a woman or being black. There's NO way ANYONE could EVER say, "I don't hate blacks. I just hate the color of their skin," or "I don't hate women. I just hate their female gender or womanlike appearance." However, there IS such a thing as homosexual behavior and you CAN DEFINITELY say, "I don't hate gays. I just don't approve of the act of sex between two people of the same gender. However, if they want to do it, it's their business." That's no different than saying, "I don't hate unwed mothers. I just hate the act of fornicating and having children out of wedlock. However, if they want to do it, it's their business." THAT makes sense, doesn't it? Do you understand the distinction?

20090304095739AA0eqVE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did moses make the whole thing up?	It is widely accepted that Moses wrote the Pentateuch. (the first five books of the bible) It is believed by most Christians that the bible is the word of God, never reading the Torah. When moses came around, Jews had been following the word of God already. (the Torah) So, moses freed the slaves and then wrote his books. If the creation events were so important why didn't God leave that up to Abraham? (who wrote the Torah in part) So here comes along Moses to tell what God forgot to with Abraham, or improve on the story.(his story) Does that sound right? Such a shame you God is so illusive.   He is Kinda like big foot. So many people claim to have seen him yet any time someone claims to have proof their proved a fraud.

20090304101932AAwqJHt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can you breakthrough my confusions?	I'm a bit confused while reading the Bible. The Bible sometimes seems to say that God doesn't change His mind or repent because He has never sinned.       Numbers 3:19    God is not a man that he should lie; neither the son of a man that he should repent.       1 Samuel 15:29    The Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.      Why is it then written in the same book that God repents of the evil things He thought about His chosen people?      Exodus 32:14    And the Lord repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people.      EVIL THOUGHTS IN GOD'S MIND? HOW CAN GOD THINK OF EVIL THINGS.      Another point where I'm a little confused is that the word "DEATH" is often used in the Bible. It's mostly used for condemning the unrighteous. It clearly says that the righteous must not perish & the unrighteous must perish. It also states that DEATH entered through Sin. What kind of death is it? Death of flesh or death of spirit? If it's the death of flesh, then we all die. But the Bible tells us that if we remain in Christ, we are righteous & according to God's own law, righteous doesn't perish [die]. Christ even said that anyone believed in Him would never see the death. But since there have been so many Christians who truthfully followed Christ & yet died. In fact Christ, who is known to be without Sin, also had the death of flesh. So what is this DEATH supposed to mean? Is it the second death spoken in Revelation?      Another point, which is often considered to be a failed prophecy in the Bible.      Jesus said to His disciples that some of the people of His time would not taste the death unless they had seen Jesus coming into His kingdom with all the Glory of God.      I tell you the truth, some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." Matthew 16:28 (NIV)    When you are persecuted in one place, flee to another. I tell you the truth, you will not finish going through the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes. Matthew 10:23 (NIV)    So be on your guard; I have told you everything ahead of time. "But in those days, following that distress, "`the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' [1] "At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens."Now learn this lesson from the fig tree: As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see these things happening, you know that it is near, right at the door. I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Mark 13:23-30 (NIV)       Did Jesus return? Was He speaking of His second coming to judge the world? Jesus even claimed that His disciples wouldn't finish going until Christ returned. He even mentioned that all those things spoken concerning the end of the world would happen in the time of His generation [I think that’s why He used the word “THIS GENERATION”]. He didn’t only mention the destruction of Jerusalem, but also of the entire world. He boldly said that the end would happen in the generation of Christ since He said that none knew the hour & the day of the end, not even Himself, but the Father alone. How could He say it since the end was also unknown to Him? And if He really remained in God [which means He knew everything God knew], how could He then be unknown to the hour? Didn’t He contradict Himself?         Jesus cried out, saying “MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?”      It seemed that Jesus was without help at that time & He got no help from God. How can this be possible since Jesus Himself claimed to be the one who could supply all kinds of helps? A helper needs help?

By contrast, nearly 70% of child victimizers were white, while just over 25% of child victimizers were black.      *White inmates were nearly 3 times more likely than black inmates to have had a child victim.

She started smiling at me (even though I had never seen her before), so I started to smile back out of politeness, and then we started saying “hi” to each other etc and she makes a point of waving at me if she sees me. She tries to make eye contact to say hi if we walk through the same building, and tries to strike up conversation if I see her at the gym (where she works). This has been going on for some weeks now and it happens everytime she sees me and her friends always seem to make a big deal of it too - i heard one girl say "naomi, look!" when I walked round the corner. I was walking with my group of friends last friday, and she was with hers, and they were saying to her “go on, just do it” and I heard Naomi say “but what if she isn’t, what if she says no?”. I can’t be sure they were talking about me, because I was right in front of them, so I was sure they wouldn’t have said it so loudly and blatantly! But then today, my friend Katie said to me “Naomi was talking about you to some girls in the canteen, she was saying you really fancy her and follow her around.” I was so shocked because this isn’t true! I do like her, and do fancy her, but it’s her who makes a point of speaking to me and not the other way round! What do you guys think?? Thanks, Sav x

I'm not trying to offend anyone who is Atheist by my questions, I'm just curious.       When and where did Atheism begin?   What are some positive and negative experiences you've had being Atheist?   Since most people base their morals on religion, what do Atheists base their morals on?   Would you say there is a certain way to become an Atheist? Another words does it take a while to become one, or does it happen more suddenly?       Thanks! :)

20090304095644AAEFg00	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	To all Muslims out there...?	(NO offense to any other religion it has nothing to do with anyone other than a muslim)   Don't you think Dr Zakir Naik should stop portraying islam in wrong way, And at least don't do it at international level.    I mean All his answers are like "Islam says this..... But that religion says............... which is worst". He Compare islam with any other religion and try to justify his answer. Does not that mean comparing Allah to other gods. Other religions may say or do bad stuff that does not mean Allah needs to just be better than them. Allah is the GOD he should do the right thing he should not be compared to bad teachings of other GODs. I mean he makes islam looks like "someone justifying robbery by saying that man murdered." That's not what we want our religion to look like.    I know  some questions are hard to answer, If you don't have a good answer back off but don't make our religion look bad by constantly saying it is at least not like that religion.  For instance one of his question was   Why is a man allowed to have more than one wife in Islam? i.e. why is polygamy allowed in Islam?   and he answered .......Hindus are more polygamous than Muslims    I know Islam has a reason for that and we all respect it.   But according to Dr Naik's argument if hindus were not more polygamous, then Islam were to be wrong? Does that what he means? If hinduism did not exist islam would have been a bad religion? It was just one question. He answers almost every question that way.   We need to stop him, at least not acknowledge him because if I can ask this question today. Tomorrow someone else would, I wonder many has already. If this question arises it would be adisgracee to our pure religion. You don't proove yourself right by saying others are wrong. Allah is right because he is right not because someone else is bad.

I am not Mormon, but grew up in Utah, and am very fond of the LDS who were my friends.  My character is a less active Mormon, coming back from war, and for the first time in years goes to a meeting where he tells a strange story, but a beautiful one full of faith. But before him a few others will speak.      The only places I could find this was on exmormon website -- and I think those are pretty skewed.  I just wondered what kinds of things regular, nice, LDS people say.

20090304115938AA7pHcN	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Asking a friend on a date (a question in a question)?	I will say up front that I am a bit inexperienced when it comes to dating. Somehow I always seem to end up finding myself more the guy 'friend' than a boyfriend.      So, there is this young woman I know who I really like and we have been friends about four months now. About a month ago she broke off with a long time boyfriend. After that, we've seen each other more, hung out, done things in groups, and even just spent time together, having meals, watching movies, having a drink, visiting places etc, but none of them have really been thought of as 'dates' by either of us. We've talked a lot, shared a lot, and helped each other through some stuff. I REALLY like her. I like her as a friend and I would like her to be more than that. The problem is that I don't know if she really feels the same way and I am a bit scared to ask her and tell her how I feel in case it ruins the friendship, so I sort of feel trapped. I feel like if I never say anything and she finds another boyfriend, then I will be pretty sick, but if I say something and she feels we can't be friends, then I will be sick at that too.      Should I just keep going as a friend and hope we somehow just draw closer and both realize together. Or should I press it and make a move and risk it? Are there signs I should be watching off that would tell me whether I am doing the right thing or not.      Related to that, what is the difference in a guy that you see as a friend vs a guy that you would see as a boyfriend?

20090304120543AANY1RB	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	In your opinion is rp (role playing) a waste of time and why? (please answer in a non sarcastic manner)?	i just want to see the pros and cons of rp (role playing) from the thoughts of others      i am not talking about role playing sex i am talking about just living in a fantasy world you control and can be anybody and do anything..      example: 5 people are role playing in a yahoo conference one is a dragon/human who can change back and forth at will one is a tiny pink winged pixie but has a spell to grow in height and excels in herbal healing another is a nasty little goblin always picking on the poor pixie as well as others another is a demon/angel and finally there is a sweet shadow dragon who can teleport within others shadows and transform between his dragon self and human self and also has a secret crush on the pixie but they in the end all get along and have fun together and sometimes the occasional battle with strangers and trespassers......      well that was a taste of what type of rp im talking about and every character is played by the person who created it so the question is................         what are your views on that type of rp and why??               AND REMEMBER I AM LOOKING FOR REAL ANSWERS NOT SARCASM OR BASHING BECAUSE THOSE COMMENTS WILL BE REPORTED!!!!!!!!
