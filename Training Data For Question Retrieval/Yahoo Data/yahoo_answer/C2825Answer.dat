DbCO4ThNaa	Are you opening a restaurant? Hmm when it comes to like casual dining I like a dim light and just comfortable seating. Plus the wait staff has to be really friendly. Its nice when you go to family owned restaurants and they have pictures of there family and what not on the walls. The outside decor doesnt have to be great. Because you shouldnt judge a book by its cover. In the end though I would say the most important would be customer satisfaction and great food at decent prices.|`|JfVxCDb7aa	good tasting food<br>  in a non sterile atmosphere<br>  nor do I want sickening elevator music being piped in<br>  I also want fast service and an<br>  attentive waitress who stops by the table often...|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	No kids!!!<br>  <br>  Now THAT would make for a pleasant dining experience!|`|30ecbe20cb8d75d58c2d766f12003e87aa	tables, chairs.

o1J2OAdUaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I think you should go to Hyde Park after the museums! it's beautiful and best around this time of year. It's about a 10 minute walk from the museums (check out google maps), or you can take a bus from South Ken Station. Also, High Street Kensington is nearby (again about 10 mins walk from Hyde Park, 20 from the museums), and there are some great little restaurants there! My favourites are Wagamama's (great vege options!) and Giraffe. also there's a place called foubert's taht does home-made ice-cream! good as an ice-cream place, not so much as a restaurant.<br>  <br>  Finally, the Haagen Daaz place is in one of the corners of the actual square of leicester square lol (depends which exit you take, ask around when u get there if you need to...). but i would recommend checking out some of the oterh ice cream places; they're pricey, but pretty good!<br>  <br>  have fun!|`|CMsceWkUaa	the haagen daaz restaurant is actually in the main square. you won't miss it. i think it's next to the bella italia restaurant, but i haven't been there in a while. all the restaurants around there are lovely, why not go for a walk and find a restaurant that caters for veggies?have fun.|`|IUw0f5u5aa	Will try and look up some, and then let you know.|`|Y47WgY4Laa	You could go for dinner at Beatroot on Berwick Street (Soho) which is vegetarian.<br>  <a href="http://www.beatroot.org.uk/intro.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatroot.org.uk/intro.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.london-eating.co.uk/6125.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.london-eating.co.uk/6125.htm</a><br>  <br>  You could also try Maoz on Old Compton Street, which is Mediterranean veggie.<br>  <a href="http://www.london-eating.co.uk/6897.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.london-eating.co.uk/6897.htm</a><br>  <br>  If you like Indian food, Sagar on Percy Street has great vegetarian food:<br>  <a href="http://www.london-eating.co.uk/30216.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.london-eating.co.uk/30216.htm</a><br>  <br>  The VeganLondon website has good restaurants listings for vegetarians and vegans:<br>  <a href="http://www.veganlondon.co.uk/eat/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.veganlondon.co.uk/eat/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  The Haagen Daz Cafe is on Leicester Square, near the Vue cinema.<br>  <a href="http://www.haagen-dazs.co.uk/cafes/locator.htm#" rel="nofollow">http://www.haagen-dazs.co.uk/cafes/locat...</a>|`|Kiq9LSmtaa	When I was stationed there in the 80's, I had the fortune to go to the "Queens Moat house" in london - it was fantastic!!!<br>  <br>  Although It was expensive :(|`|dYI2r7Ylaa	For a genuinely nice and memorable day or evening in London, I would steer clear of Leicester Square if I where you....|`|gq0iay9Caa	go to chiquitos! its a good mexican place right in leicester square, you wont miss it..<br>  <br>   there were plenty of vegetarian options and if you like mexican food i would really recommend it, fun atmosphere and yummy food!

But really and truely im often disappointed when i go there. yes i love the salad and the breadsticks. why do they bring out three breadsticks when there is two of you? whos just going to eat one? But the food i think is just average. im not sure if i ever had anything there i just loved. I would rather go to macaroni grill or johnny carinos for italian. have the italian nachos at johnny carinos. your heart will melt.|`|3804c41362b69be635d5ce9b2c2404d3aa	I do, mainly because my wife loves the unlimited soup,salad,and breadsticks-- talk about an inexpensive date!

Y47WgY4Laa	A lot of London's best tearooms stock wu-yi and other oolong teas. You could try Tea Palace, TeaSmith, Postcard Teas or have a look at their online shops.<br>  <br>  South of the river, try Orange Pekoe (Barnes), Tea Box (Richmond), Royal Teas (Greenwich) or Teapod (Shad Thames).<br>  <br>  Links, address and more info here:<br>  <a href="http://blog.city-eating.com/2009/02/time-for-tea-londons-loveliest-local-tearooms.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.city-eating.com/2009/02/time...</a><br>  <br>  Buying online might be easier. You can usually get free trial sachets. Do a Google search and see what you can find.<br>  <br>  p.s. Wu-yi is basically an expensive type of oolong tea, so if you've seen the 'magical weightloss cure' claims about it - don't believe the hype. It's very good for you, but won't do much for your waistline!|`|llxvKN27aa	o 78th street there is ths fabulous little place with the most darling little crumpets and wu-yi-tea<br>  gud luq!

Or Santee Falafel for Middle Eastern food, you can share the food and be more connected.

RDQittNDaa	Many companies do this to verify that the account exists in the first place.  Oftentimes you'll see this happen with credit card usage at gas stations where you are pre-approved for a small amount (usually between $1.00-$2.00) which is then credited back to your account upon your transaction clearing with the company a day or two later.|`|n6NthDxwaa	It's not just restaurants...I did the same thing, and called the card company. The first is the actual transaction date, and the second is the withdrawal of funds date. You are only charged once. If you run the transaction as a debit(which most places don't unless you tell them to), it will only appear once on your statement.|`|PLREayzdaa	Some restaurants are on a dial up connection where the transaction goes to your account twice, just to make sure it connected to your bank and went through, in the end you only have one posted charge and the hold is released on the other charge, but it can look a little funny at first.|`|pUzJiMUcaa	Usually a pre-authorization is a type of hold on a card...basically, the merchant uses it to check the balance, to ensure there is enough to cover something before the charge is authorized.<br>  <br>  This is very common for Hotels, or gas stations where you put your card in prior to pumping.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure why a BK would be doing it, that's what's behind it.|`|XRM30ja9aa	It does not bill twice, the pre auth will fall off when payment goes through it is just a way to make sure you have the money in the account.

If you want to surprise her, ask her friends.  She'll think it's sweet that you're taking her out and that you care so much about making her happy.  <br>  <br>  Just based on personal preference, though, Red Lobster is awesome!

People expect to have all the relevant information they need in the invitation, so that is a good place to do it. If you are bad at telling people that they need to pay, doing it in writing should be easier for you.  It is important that you not only tell them they have to pay for themselves but that you also tell them the exact cost. $25 is pretty pricey and some of your friends may not be able to go because of it.  <br>  <br>  The line in the invitation could go like this:<br>  WHERE: The Buffet on Main Street and Southern. The cost is $25 a person to enter.
