Mate, there's nought wrong with your size ........... you're just right ........ but the more important question is surely how vital and healthy and energetic are you??  stay away from the prepackaged high fat, high processed sugar junky type foods and eat loads of fresh green vegies and some fruit each day ..... drink plenty of water too and ditch the sodas or pop if you drink any cos they'll dehydrate you and are loaded with man made highly processed nutritionally devoid sugar ..... snack on foods from Gods table and you'll always glow with vibrance and energy........ and please don't give away your power to be happy by asking a bunch of strangers.... or anyone for that matter .... whether you are acceptable ....... the only persons opinion of you that should ever really matter is your own.    peace baby  ?|`|0qtgH7lNaa	gah, stop worrying about your freaking weight when you're only in the 5th grade. just stop.|`|VUIEnZpnaa	Well ive seen you before and lets just say your big boned|`|A6foMcOgaa	wow u r not fat...yur still young you have a lot of developing to do..all the baby fat dissapears when yu r fully developed...its better to have some type of body then b real skinny...|`|O9lTqrbbaa	you are average, and you are in the fifth grade-things will definitely change.|`|hYH0dzVEaa	nope   you are actually one pound under the average for your height  here is what doctors say you should be    at 5 feet 100lbs and for every inch after that add five pounds    so you are perfectly fine

We went swimming, did archery, rifles (which was really cool, even though I'm a girl), crafts, nature, boating, etc. It truly is like a regular camp except we would all check our blood and take shots together. I think I was one of the first ones with a pump so I got a little special treatment but it was really fun.  Just don't accidentally touch someone else's needle! I did and had to get hepatitis shots. :(|`|Knz8iJSWaa	Diabetes camps help people affected by diabetes lead healthier, happier, and more productive lives through good diabetes management.

Enjoy.|`|cASB8Sh3aa	You will do a ton of outside activities and never have to worry about feeling weird about needing to test, or if you are low, or needing to take a shot since everyone has diabetes.

AYyTlTSkaa	First, if you can have the surgery done, get it done.    Second, I've never in my life heard of a insurance company flat out refusing to fill a legit prescription, birth control pills or not.      If cost is an issue-try calling around to places like CVS,  Bartells, Walgreens, Safeway, Wal-mart, Kmart and Fred Meyer.  Tell them what your taking and ask if they do a price match or offer them for $4.  Wal-mart and Walgreens both offer a chit load of drugs for under $5.50 a month, and I think birth control pills is one of them.      Going to planned parenthood is a good idea.  But be honest with them.|`|AA12316174	They will direct you to your local health clinic. Planned parenthood's mission/goal is to help prevent unwanted pregnancies not to treat medical conditions.

(Swear I had forgotten how 'light' a normal period was - had to start on iron supplements over the summer as my blood loss was so severe - even with the bc controlling my bleeding).    Don't go to Planned Parenthood go out and find more info on Laparascopy, having one doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to have children later on.  There are plenty of websites devoted to this topic  where you can contact other women who have  gone through this.  Please look into them.

Most insurance companies cover all or at least some portion of birth control pills.     Planned Parenthood bases their "free" pills on a sliding scale...meaning you only get pills totally free if you make under a certain income.     And no, you don't need to tell them the reason you're going on birth control pills. If you feel the need to tell them something, just say you need it to regulate your period or take care of horrible cramps.     However, Planned Parenthood does check to see if you already have health insurance somewhere else, and if you do, you'll have to pay the same costs as you would at your regular doctor.|`|5a066f23730087641ff3d156e7a2b41faa	They will not care.

TB can come back, so maybe it's something recent.  Maybe he just got it. But it's important for him to talk to you. Do you know anything about it? Try looking it up on medical sites or wikipedia for a quick overview.    Chances are its something from his past.  If you're still uncomfortable, you can get easily tested.  I don't know if they can test babies/toddlers.  If your bf is showing the signs and symptoms of TB then you need to be concerned. If it's something that's recently started then maybe he just got it, but if the doctor knew, your bf would probably be in the hospital.|`|6TuxC5BLaa	Is he coughing constantly and have you seen blood anywhere because if you have tb sometimes you cough up blood.

If you're diagnosed with TB they don't just let you walk out into society. They put you in the hospital in a negative pressure room until it's under control. If it was from his past, then he's already taken the medication and he's well now. Doctors don't just let you walk around with TB. Plus don't freak out because it's totally curable.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Contracting TB is not like catching a cold. It's not transmitted that easily. But you've been living with him and so has your daughter. I would ask him right out. Don't beat around the bush. TB is treatable and isn't like it used to be. There are very good medicines available.  Depending on his answer you might want to get yourself and your daughter tested just to put your mind at ease.  Worst case scenario you and your daughter have to take medicine for a while.

If you have to go to your GP for a referral, they will almost always suggest it is "non-specific dermatitis" and want you to rub hydro cortisone cream into it.      Non-itchy rashes could be just about anything, with the exception of hives, which almost certainly will cause itching.  Do you have known allergies?    A vitamin D deficiency can also cause a mild red rash that sounds similar to what you have, I don't recall the medical term for it, but I went through that the first year I moved to Colorado from California.

Aerobic Activities  ? Do at least 10 minutes at a time.  ? You can combine moderate and vigorous activities.  ? Slowly build up the amount of time you do physical activities. The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

If its still stuck I would advise you see an ENT (ear, nose and throat doctor). They'll definitely be able to help you. How often do you get these stones? Because if its quite frequent and burdensome you can possibly get your tonsils removed and you'll be rid of them for life. Doctors don't usually recommend because when your older, a tonsillectomy recovery is more painful, but you'll never ever have to deal with a tonsilith (the actual name of the stone) again.|`|nF9DZ0sOaa	You might try using a water pik or something of that nature.  If it doesn't come out, it might be impacted, and that calls for a doctor's visit!|`|AA11225694	Tonsilloliths, or tonsil stones as they are also called, result from debris that gets lodged in your tonsillar crypts. In plain English, these crypts are pockets in your tonsils. Obviously, if your tonsils have been removed, you won't have this problem.    Tonsils range from being relatively smooth, with shallow pockets, to very rough with deep pockets. When your tonsils are swollen regularly, as they are with chronic tonsillitis, the openings to these crypts or pockets may become wider, and the crypts deeper. This allows a greater quantity of debris to accumulate. New stones may begin to form on top of older ones.     The debris from which the stones are formed consists of food particles, dead cells from the lining of your mouth, mucous from post-nasal drip, and bacteria of various sorts, especially anaerobic bacteria from the back of the tongue. Keep in mind that the anaerobic bacteria are a primary cause of bad breath. All of this gets jumbled up together and attacked by white blood cells. The result is a white or yellowish, cauliflower-shaped lump that's typically rock-hard and usually tastes horrible and smells atrocious.Join Our New Tonsil Stone Community  We're creating a community for everyone who suffers from tonsil stones. Create your own free web page. Tell your tonsil stone story. Ask and answer questions. Get and give feedback. Get and give encouragement. You can even upload pictures. Let's help each other as much as possible. It's easy to get started. Just click here!         As I've read what's been posted around the Internet by people who suffer from this condition, it's obvious that most people know very little about tonsil stones. Those who have them but don't understand what they are or where they come from, worry that they have a serious disease, maybe even cancer. Relax! Nothing could be further from the truth.    Those of you who really suffer from this problem will probably find this difficult to believe, but for many people, tonsil stones are barely noticeable. The stones are small, the tonsil crypts not too deep, so the stones fall out on their own or as the result of a cough. But for others, tonsil stones may cause extreme discomfort. In addition to chronic bad breath, failure to remove tonsilloliths may result in the feeling that there's an object lodged in the back of the throat. It could also cause a persistent sore throat as well as frequent bouts of tonsillitis.    Now that you have an understanding of what they are, where and how they form, you're ready to learn how to remove tonsilloliths, and more importantly, how to prevent tonsil stones from forming in the first place.    Many people remove tonsilloliths by poking at them and scraping them out with a fingernail. There are drawbacks to using this method. For one thing, it's not very hygienic plus you could scratch your tonsil. If you insist on using this method, please wash your hands thoroughly with an anti-bacterial soap first.    Another low-tech method is to use a cotton swab to squeeze your tonsil until any stones come out. If you decide to try this, I recommend that you moisten the swab with water first. This will help prevent cotton strands from sticking to your tonsil.    |`|YUugeUHxaa	Usually, the only time I am aware of them is when I cough hard enough for one to come flying out of my mouth.

From what you people are saying, all women who remove the hair from the surface of their armpit skin are lesbians.|`|oYSDEWrfaa	I am not sure about "electric shavers" but as a woman I always use a regular razor always new and clean double or triple blade. I have never tried electric. My advice is to "steam" or put heat there before you shave so that you open the pores and can get the cleanest possible shave results. Also other things you can do is use a exfoliating cloth first with heat to remove any dry skin and to be sure there are ingrown hairs. After you shave you might want to go over it again gently with the same cloth to prevent ingrown hairs too. There are also special shaving gel's and products for people with sensitive skin.    Heat to open the pours seems to me what you need to do. Don't use a broken shaver or razor ever.     ALSO shave SLOWLY, if you have a sensitive area on the body always shave slowly to getter better results and to lessen your chances of getting irritation.     Good luck|`|WsMXhqcZaa	I've never liked electric shavers. It just isn't made for that type of hair.  Use a regular blade shaver with new blades and soap up first.|`|FPmSgMsNaa	you shaved your armpits??    are you gay???    or a swimmer?|`|Ti476VHkaa	Why do you shave your arm pits anyway. .That's kind of weird. You shouln't do that.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	are you a boy? you shave your underarms? it probably from irritation get some shaving creme and do it that way and put some lotion on after your done or aloe vera|`|AA10503158	Most men aren't required to shave their arm pits. Just keep it trimmed is all.|`|PRGNC4Bzaa	razor burn did you use shaving cream|`|r7qsCMqMaa	Did you use after shave or Nivea lotion on it after?|`|MXAZ7Vohaa	it depends on the razor and the deodorant. like when i did it for swimming it was irritated at first but then went away|`|ZeeeaUQsaa	Put neosporin under your armpits and never shave your pits with an electric shaver again! Use a manual razor if you're going to do that!|`|0U9Lm5gmaa	neosporin|`|ThIhs95Caa	Men don't shave their arm pit hair unless they are gay or a swimmer.      Even if you ARE gay, you still shouldn't shave your arm pits b/c other gay guys are attracted to MEN, not women and MEN don't shave their arm pits.      The only reason you could have to shave them is if you are a swimmer OR if you want to be a woman.  In that case, you MUST use a new razor w/lots of shaving cream and moisturize afterwards.|`|mRyG5Cvjaa	Put Noxema on it.|`|AA11690239	Sensitive skin I would say|`|ZuQzhhXmaa	put neosporin on it and leave it be for a couple days. Sometimes when you shave it just gets razor burn like crazy. Try to use shaving cream next time, and shave with the hair instead of against it. Good luck!!!|`|x1dhpKWgaa	Shaving your underarm hair is like rubbing Icy hot underneath your arms.  Your crazy, I wont ask why you did this, But next time just trim them with tweezers.  I suggest putting ice in a face clothe and holding it there for about 5 to 10 minutes.|`|z0gdLgQ4aa	Electric shavers tend to take the top layer of skin off.     BTW: just use some regular clippers with the shortest guard.|`|eyQBvbzraa	maybe you shaved too hard or maybe the blade was dull. if the irritation persists,see a dr.|`|IPy8h0VVaa	For starters, you could go ahead and tell your parents you're gay.|`|d17d21c4104847c065c9faed1b10ecf6aa	haha, well most guys don't do that, but if you like to then that's cool.  it may be your deodorant or your razor.  Venus Breeze's are very good with that.|`|581AaVoJaa	because the razor irritates skin not everybody but it happens i seen people that after gettin line ups their face gets irritated|`|XtPH3WgPaa	You may be allergic to the shaving gel you used or the razor may be dull. Some irritation is to be expected from shaving. I know it's not manly, but try a little lotion, it really works.     Hope this helps|`|4JcgIuBqaa	Men do not shave under their arms!|`|RBxIBSKUaa	I'm not a guy, but I think I have a good answer for your question. Well, I had some irritation after shaving my underarms, too, so I asked my doctor about it. She said that if you shave then apply deodorant/antiperspirant right after, it can cause irritation. I guess something in the deodorant gets into the really tiny cuts in your skin, which makes your underarm red and painful. She told me that I should wait for a while after shaving to apply deodorant or to shave at night, then put deodorant on in the morning. It has helped me a lot. It's totally common to have irritated underarms, so don't worry. Hopefully, this will help you:)

xDU7hGe3aa	You should be evaluated at a medical facility as soon as possible since you are experiencing persistent upper respiratory irritation. What will probably happen when you go to the ER is that they will observe you carefully for 6 to 12 hours for signs of upper airway obstruction and give you some oxygen by mask to patients with respiratory complaints. The biggest concern is that patients who have received severe exposure may develop pulmonary edema (swelling of the lung tissue) that can lead to serious complications. Better safe than sorry- have someone take you to the hospital dear!|`|AA10932670	Hon, i know how that feels.I thought i could clean a large floor with straight ammonia!!

IXfUEIXkaa	Fake smile? Don't bother with falsity, it's not worth it. Life is a pain at 16, regardless of all the upset you go through at home. But remember, in time it won't be an issue anymore. You will be old enough to move out and get your own job and your own finances and you'll be out of that situation soon enough. Those 2 years go fast, trust me. I couldn't stand my family and now I'm living on the other side of the world. There's still hope, just have your friends take you to the movies or something when you need an out, vent once in awhile and don't let the stresses build up, encourage your creativity (it helps with the stress), and remember it will be over soon.|`|AA10932670	Does your town have a help line you can call?You can try going for walks when it gets too bad at home,just stay where there are plenty of other people(too many nuts out there).Try a gymnasium,you can hit that punching bag as hard as you want.Good luck sweetie|`|ZyAzj9tmaa	You should talk to someone about this that you can trust.     To me it sounds like you need an outlet for all this going at home. Its only an outlet, it won't solve the problem    One of the best ways to fix it is to look at your problems through a better perspective.     Our surroundings can effect us, but you should be the one who determines how to act upon it.     16 is a young age for this sort of dilema. I know how it is though, it's only a phase through a person's life.

Apart from that you should realize that whatever is happening is none of your faults, you are too young for this stress you have ur whole life infront of you, also try talkin to your mom and helping her.

You are going to need help to get through this very stressful and trying time in  your lifeand it your school counselor's job as well as her duty to help you. If are having trouble getting in to see this counselor, then talk to a teacher you can trust to intervene for you, but you have got to get some help with this.

d3763ffe8a408a6f237ac5a0c3458f1caa	Set a date on when you want to quit.    Change your routine/habits....    Prior to the quite date, start buying different kinds of cigarrette brands.  I used to smoke menthol lights (B&H), so I went out and bought non-menthols (Kools)    Try cutting down on the amount of cigs you smoke a day.    My smoke schedule used to be the following    one on the way to work  right before lunch  after lunch  sometime in the afternoon  on the way home  after dinner  maybe before bed    before the quit date I subtracted one cig every day til I hit the quit date.    On the quit date be sure to have gum or something to chew on when you have the urge to blaze.    I used carrot sticks or celery to fight off the urges.    The toughest part for me was the weekends when around  with my friends that smoke.  It is also the time when I drink alcohol.    Be sure to let your friends know you are quitting.  I placed a side bet with my co-workers that if they seen me smoking, I'll give them $10 a day.    Dont give up.  My quit date was delayed 2-3 days because of my last minute urges.          I smoked for about 13yrs and finally decided to quit for my son.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you could investigate a web search for "nicorette activestop".|`|d07883ba1560bd9abbc7f79e6d024f32aa	Go on the nicotine patch, or use the nicotine gum or lozenges.|`|7a761aec681bd06716889f927e122ff0aa	two things I have noticed: stop saying I am trying to quit. Say instead, I no longer smoke. That may seem trivial, but mind set is everything.    Now here's something that's worked for everyone I know who's tried it. You really need to see how disgusting the habit is, so try this: Carry around a little jar, with a little water in it. When you smoke, discard the butt in there. When you want to smaoke another cigarette, open the jar and take a sniff. Seriously, that will make you see how ugly it is. Everyone I know who's tried it says it was the clincher. Good luck.|`|3S0WRhWCaa	Cold turkey.  I am 2 years and 3 months without.  I used sugar free suckers and chewed gum.  Just pick a day and throw your pack out.  The first three days were AWFUL for me.  After that it was all in my mind.  And I just kept saying "I'm not smoking today."  "If I still want one tomorrow maybe then, but not today."  Also I put aside the money I would have used towards cigarettes and every three months I spent it on whatever I wanted or went somewhere with it.  I've been to some fun places including Disneyland and water parks with that money.  I even went on a coastal trip of California all the way to the Oregon coast on my " smoke money". Those were some things that worked for me.  Good luck and you CAN do it.|`|23UWoZwuaa	Read the info provided at http://tiny.cc/4vu1F|`|xXYuH7oYaa	Try to keep yourself busy, the more time you have to sit and think the more you'll want to smoke, keep plenty of gum on hand, whenever you have the urge, replace the habit with something else, like chewing gum. If you need more help, nicotine gum tastes a lot better these days than it used to, so try that and in between that chew regular gum. If you've been a smoker for a   of years and smoke A LOT, then you may want to try one of the prescription medications available at your doctors office.|`|bEwz2ePXaa	i agree with crystal. keep a gum or a menthol candy as a replacement. smoking is a habit and you cant get rid of it at once, so what you're going to do is lessen the amount day after day, until you will reach the time that you will not take it anymore, because you're already used of not having one..|`|DIt1H5m1aa	Try to get more information regarding some ways to stop smoking at my profile.

926dW6AWaa	Hola!!    EL HIMEN (ver tambin Virginismo ac)    En su justa medida quiere decir que ambos tienen que saber bien de que se trata. Y la tendencia es a deformar esta realidad.    El himen es una membrana delgada que se encuentra a la entrada de la vagina. No cubre todo el orificio vaginal, ya que tiene que salir el flujo comn y el menstrual.    La ruptura del himen se puede producir a cualquier edad, con determinado movimientos o ejercicios, en la primera relacin sexual, en posteriores, con el parto.    Hay un tipo de himen que suele llamarse complaciente que es muy elstico y est a los bordes de la abertura vaginal, por lo cual no se rompe, en general, hasta el primer parto.    La ruptura del himen en la primera relacin sexual puede producir un peque?o sangrado y algo de dolor. Puede quiere decir que no siempre es as.    Ademas......... como veras aun habiendo penetracion, puedes tener el himen integro, y no por eso eres virgen...    Es una actiutd mental......    Ademas........ es a ti a quien le debe importar ser virgen o no?  Te lo preguntaste?  Salu2!!|`|BMmWGSWKaa	Tecnicamente si no rompio el himen seguis siendolo..saludos!|`|8T04NQgKaa	Si.

C8i1dg8Maa	You need to talk to your doctor, babe. I know that sounds like the last thing you want to do right now, but it will help in the long run. A bunch of people on Answers and a quiz cannot diagnose you, period. It would be hard to just 'learn to live with it' because you should be able to control it, rather than letting it take over.    Good luck. :]|`|AA11820208	this is oneinstance in which you need to get over you parent issues and tell them what is going on.  If you are still a dependant on their health insurance, you need to involve them.  If you want help, seek out a psychiatrist (pschologist later) who can evaluate you and give you an Rx to try and help.  If you are bipolar and you are bipolar I (like me) you run the risk of having a full blown manic episode with psychotic features.  The best I can compare that to is like dropping acid without actually taking drugs.  Knowing what acid is like, that comparison is the best I have.  The difference is, acid wears off, mania sticks around until you loose all sense of yourself and then you are taken away in police custody and forced to stay in a hospital.  If you really want help, firmly aproach your parents about your situation.    Be careful and be safe.|`|n1z3eUvZaa	You may or may not be bipolar.|`|43p3JuDXaa	Everyone has mood swings.

The diet includes cutting calories, mainly junk foods and processed foods. This is the most important part of the process. You can use a few techniques to "trick" your body into thinking it has had enough food. Those include spicier foods, more fluidic foods, and foods that are higher in fiber. Eat smaller meals and more frequently to keep your metabolism active during the day.    Then the exercise should be evenly split between weight/strength training and cardio workouts. The exercise should go on no less than thirty minutes a day and no more frequently than every other day, to give you body time to rest and recover. Not only will the combination of the diet and exercise drop your weight, but it will also tone you up and speed up your metabolism to keep off the weight better than just dieting alone will do.|`|6LswwsP2aa	The key to losing FAT in your stomach and an overall toned body is consuming less calories per day, a very strict diet, resistance training, and many reps w/ light weights.  Eat only protein and omega-3's like tuna, salmon, eggwhites, flax, lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes, and healthy carbs like fruits, vegetables and whole grains. Protein shakes are effective but can make you bloated. Also eat 5-6 small meals per day (increases your metabolism which makes you lose quickest and retains healthy blood sugar).  The meals should include a protein, a complex carb and a good fat (ex.protein= eggwhites or lean meat, comp. carb= small apple, and good fat= a palm-size of walnuts). Increase your aerobic/cardio activity by 30 minutes and if you stick to it, you can tone quickly in 1-2 months.|`|WD9ash9Iaa	Losing weight is so hard, but the true is, you can eat wherever yoy want, ice cream, ckes, pizza, but yoy have to eat smal portions evry day, and exercise, the best one is wlaking fast for one  hour..........|`|e3wuYF16aa	Eat Special K for every meal for 2 weeks.

TEW2oCF2aa	pooe memort means poor concentration. You can improve by improving your concentration as you may not have complete interest in what you are doing and hence loose interest.     Also develop things in which you are interested so that you will have better concentration and interest.

You are just 23 years old, and it's a bit too young to have bad memory (usually it's old people). Maybe it is because you do not like your present job? People (including me) tend to forget something when they are not interested in it. Don't concentrate hard. Just don't try to byheart everything, if you know what I mean. Understand your work, understand its purpose, work on it. If you have been working on something long enough, you tend to remember it without knowing it. Just find pleasure in your job.

KjCmegNGaa	I've heard that drinking 1 liter of green tea a day will really show results. I have also heard of the apple cider vinegar trick. Apparently drinking a glass of water with two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar mixed in, (Before a high carb meal) will burn fat calories quicker and help with weight loss. I've been trying this for a day and haven't checked for results yet. hopefully it helps! Of course the person above me who said inputting less than you output is completely correct.

Look for the sugar free fat free whip cream and angelfood cake shells and use the strawberries and make a strawberry shortcake. You will not be able to tell the difference.

RvXwjC7Yaa	the fact that you started off pretty rough has put your new lease of life into a whole new state, it seems like everything is absolutely brilliant for you now because there is a vast difference between how you were at the start and how you are now, this has come as a minor shock to your brain and you may sometimes feel like doing things that you would'nt normally do, this is normal, the change has made this happen, but overtime, (a couple of months) your mind will start thinking of your new state of character as normal, and will start lessening the frequent adrenaline filled things it constantly egged you to do, your new life, will eventually become not so good, or even boring, you wont feel abnormal, you'll feel your like everybody else, and then, you may find you want an even new life. Don't worry, your age plays a big role in this, the fact that you are young and your hormones are haywire makes it ten times worse, dont worry, it happens to most people, just go with the flow, live life as it is, and suddenly there'll come a time when you'll feel your just like everybody else. and it WILL be soon!  hope this helps!|`|lH2jrOkLaa	let time do its thing.|`|7pFYyxsWaa	time is the only best answer...so as the days pass by m sure ull rock dont worry....

816753bb8dd620241ec5c8701772362baa	Please don;t listen to those who say wanting sex 2x a day is unreasonable, because it is your body, your sex drive and your life.  If it is what you want, then there is absolutely nothing wrong with it!    That being said, relationship is all about compromise, so you need to weigh how you feel about him and how important your sex is to you.  Your sex drive is not going to decrease as you get older, and his likely is not goign to increase, so you really have to think about what YOU want.    Do you masturbate?  Could this take the place of having an actual man with you when you need to satisfy your drive?  If you don;t you should, and you probably will find you like it almost as much, if not more.    Good luck :)|`|dpQMd4yhaa	Sex drive is different for everyone, There are thos that crave it more and those that can do with out it for a while. I do know for men, as they start getting older the testostorone in thier body decreases and the body does not make as much as in the teen days. Also later on men start producing estrogen (in small amounts).    I dont think 2 times a day is extreme, I think it is a good number just like once a day. Afterall its good for the body and a great excercise.|`|AA10072754	I don't think it will up his sex drive but isn't it a bit unfair to have him not masturbate while you do it yourself?    Age can be a factor but hes a bit young still.    Maybe you are stressed out?  I learned that being stressed can up the sex drive.  I think its sort of the body's way of saying "hey I need to relax" (sex/masturbation is a stress reliever)     To answer your question i don't think so.  Sex drives aren't changed by having more sex or doing any more sexual acts.|`|b7f77ed62caf9788cdb081f64d0aaefbaa	Holy cow. Whatever happened to quality over quantity?

Your health will thank you for it.

Sometimes (though rarely), however, it may stay attached well into puberty.  It's okay to try to pull it back, but do it very gently.  If it doesn't go back then don't force, as that could cause complications and make things worse.  See the links for more info.

Your HR may increase for a time while your body adjusts to the lack of nicotine, but it should return to your current resting HR once you adjust.  I doubt your HR will decrease since you are bradycardic already and your body has a regulatory mechanism that keeps your HR at a certain level so that your body can get the blood flow that it needs.

01Ish5Kuaa	First of all, the only help you can give your friend is emotional support and understanding, because you are not qualified to diagnose or treat schizophrenia.  If she doesn't want to go to the doctor, you can't make her.  Her parents might be able to get her committed for observation, but until she is dangerous to herself or others and it becomes an emergency, as in an episode, not much else you can do.  Does your friend not have any family members who could help with this?  Keep the emergency numbers handy, and use them if she tries to harm herself or others.|`|AA11287657	I sympathise with your situation very much.  I grew up with an untreated schizophrenic brother who is still untreated because of this  terrible catch 22 situation where you cannot force them to a doctor until they either hurt themselves or someone else!  My family tried so many different ways - doctos, police etc. etc. but even when he did get into hospital he was able to check himself out!  It is such a stupid, cruel system, that enforces this because the very nature of paranoid schizophrenics (which your friend certainly sounds like) is that  they feel they are ok and it is the rest the world that out of kilter and many believe that doctors, and medications etc. are all just part of the "evil plan" against them.  The only things I can suggest right now is to read information from the links below and from my experience (I also have lived next door to a paranoid schizophrenic for 19 years)  the best thing you can do when your friend is fairly lucid (thinking fairly normally) is try to reason with her then. Tell her about examples of people who have been helped by medication and treatment (see if  you can find positive examples from the links or further search on net). You could use the example of my neighbor who has been a single mother of two children for 23 years and spent many years on different medications  until finally she found the one that best suited her and now maintains that by a monthly injection and visit to a psychiatrist. Unfortunately it took police intervention because she was having a terrible time and they had to be called to protect the children.  But for mnay years now she has been on an even keel.  Try to reason with your firend also when she is lucid, be gently reminding her how frightening her halluciantions or voices must be for her, and wouldn't she love it if they were gone? Then get ther to a phsychiatirst asap iof she agrees.  But remember, you must protect yourself too and if you feel she is becoming a danger to you - call the police - it just may be the intervention needed.  I would also consider going to a counsellor yourself to talk about your friendhsip with this girl, and how it affects you.  All the very best to you! :)|`|fJFSNdqfaa	How old is your friend?      A friend of mine, who I suspected of exhibiting early signs of schizophrenia, recently tried to commit suicide.  He didn't die, thank God.  However, his legs (both femurs) ,hands, and jaw were shattered ....not to mention the rest of the internal trauma.    After all was said and done, he came out of it with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.  and I had said nothing.....    If you truly believe your friend has schizophrenia (1% of the population does), then you need to talk to this person's parents.    Depending on her age, they could have her forcibly taken into care.  And  if she says anything that would suggest self harm, she can be taken as well.    I haven't dealt with many people with this illness, but I would try showing her a psychology text - show her that her feelings of grandeur, extreme paranoia, and her warped view of life are all symptoms of the illness.    Also, show her that the earlier it's detected, the easier it is to treat and the prognosis is generally much better.    good luck|`|YH2W6JHraa	If your friend is under the age of eighteen, her parents can place in her in a psychiatric center for seventy-hours while a psychiatrist evaluates her for more intensive treatment.    If she's over the age of eighteen, her family can still have her placed in a center but someone must be willing to be her guardian while she goes through treatment (much like Brittney Spears).    Have a heart to heart conversation with your friend's family and let them know how concerned you are about her safety.  Encourage them to seek the assistance of an attorney if they decide to go for guardianship.  Once you've talked with the family then remove yourself from the situation.  Your friend needs more help then you are able to give her at this point.  Being around her will only make things harder for you.  You've fulfilled your obligation by informing the family and now it's time to move on.  Good luck.
dxTFJb3Paa	Bring a parachute.|`|AA11132502	Sounds like you're having an anxiety attack.  You can work this out naturally by listening to your favorite soothing music prior to boarding and after they allow devices to be used.  An interesting book, puzzle books,  or a favorite magazine can be a good diversion.  Counseling can be useful.     Otherwise, if you don't have objections to alcohol, a small glass of wine will help you relax.  (Notice that I said this as singular!)  Anti-anxiety medications can also help, but require medical follow-up, careful dosing, and thoughtful use.|`|w9eOXcy3aa	Play a video game at an arcade with an airplane.|`|ixZNk9FRaa	Pretend Your a celebrity and your well taken care of...    (:    |`|UCD35FYBaa	What you can do is try to fall asleep while your there.Then when you wake up you might already be wherever you are going.|`|X7Fqxd4Gaa	Think of it this way. It's not a fear of flying, its' a fear of not being in control. Like being behind the wheel of a car, your in control of the speed and direction when you're driving. When you are in a plane, someone else has the control. There are more accidents with cars then there are planes. You have to think of it as look what I get to see from 36,000 feet, the beauty of it. Think of taking off as exhilarating, not fear. Fear is nothing more than your body trying to protect you. If we didn't have fear, we would walk out into a busy highway. You have to tell yourself that everything is OK. The sound of the gear going up is normal. That turbulence is nothing more than air. Think of your goal at the other end whether it be business or family.   Should you not be able to convince yourself, then maybe you could talk to a Doctor who may recommend a mild anti anxiety medication.|`|BnoSaTrIaa	Hiya,    Here are a few good tips to make the journey more relaxing;    Stretch those muscles!    Lean your right ear down to your right shoulder and stretch the left side of your neck as you do. Now, switch sides and do the other side. Now, look down and drop your chin towards your chest. Now slowly, let your head roll to the right and then to the left. Repeat slowly until you feel yourself loosen up.     You can do this same exercise for your shoulders, too. Try a few shoulder circles, as well. This is simple to do and when you take the time to do these several times a day, your range of motion will increase and you'll feel considerably more relaxed.     Wear a Smile    Always begin your flying day with a broad smile on your face. Purpose in your heart to be lighthearted on this day and every time you see someone pass them a big, sincere smile. You will be surprised how easily this action will affect your mood.    Share in a good joke or two and try to make someone else laugh. Feeling lighthearted is a good thing! Just ask Martha Stewart!     That Small Inner Voice -- Talk to yourself    Gently close your eyes and repeat positive affirmations. Tell yourself over and over what you want to believe to be true, such as: 'I am calm' or I am safe or 'I am not afraid' Keep in mind that what you believe to be true will be felt by your body!     In Support of Good Posture     Take in a few, good deep breaths as you sit up very tall. Put your feet flat on the floor. At the same time angle your thighs slightly toward the floor, arch in your lower back slightly, gently push your sternum (chest bone) back and then relax your shoulders.     Take in another good deep breath and hold your position for a minute or two. Dont allow your posture to slouch at all during this time  hold your position upright and support your good posture.    As your good posture continues to align, you will relieve all muscle tension. Do this exercise twice daily and you will find yourself naturally supporting your good posture each day.    Breathe in the Gift of Life     We can all go for weeks without a crumb of food, days at a time without water, but, we can only go for minutes without good, pure oxygen.    The average person breathes very shallowly and this makes it almost impossible to be relaxed.     Sit yourself down, purposefully, and take in a slow deep breath in through your nose until you have properly filled up your lungs.    Hold in the air in for a moment and then very slowly exhale through your lips. Breathe deeply in this way for 4 - 5 times, a few times a day.    You will feel instantly refreshed!    Listen to the Gift of Music    As much as possible, always set your mood with background mood music. Some like traditional blues, some like jazz. Try the newer nature sounds, so you can be working to background sounds of tin pans, flutes and ocean waves crashing on the beach. Whatever you choose, make sure it relaxes and does not energize you. There is a time to be energized and a time to relax. For relaxation, select the mood music over the rock and roll or the hip hop.    A good book for breathing techniques for in-flight relaxation can be found HERE    Also you can try these relaxation techniques that target specific parts of the body:    The Five Finger Exercise    -In a relaxing chair, sit back and take a few deep breaths.    -Next, establish an easy, regular breathing pattern.     -Take in a deep breath and as you exhale, touch your index finger to your thumb. Imagine a time when your body felt a healthy tired, like how you felt after a good tennis match, or just stepping out of a hot tub or sauna....     -Now, take another good deep breath, and as you exhale, touch middle finger to your thumb. Imagine a time when you had an especially loving experience, when you felt warm and safe. Take a moment to really feel that same feeling as vividly as you had experienced it....     -Next, take another deep breath, and as you exhale, touch your ring finger to your thumb and imagine a time when you performed especially well, when you aced something that was important to you. Take that feeling of accomplishment in now and feel it as fully now as you did then...     -Lastly, take one more very deep breath in and as you exhale, touch your little finger to your thumb and as you do, imagine seeing the most beautiful place you have ever experienced...or imagine how you would feel being there now...Take a moment to fully absorb the fullness of what you feel being there.... and when you're entirely ready, and bringing with you all of these same feelings for the rest of your day, come back...     Practice Progressive Relaxation    In the early 1920s, Edmund Jacobson developed Progressive Relaxation. Jacobson was one of the first to measure the electrical activity of the muscles. He believed that anxiety showed itself through tension in the muscles, and he believed that if we could reduce the muscular response, then we would also reduce th

Guys tend to be smaller, but there are exceptions to every rule.|`|2wDf1Rccaa	I've seen FAT guys with big nipples, but I always see small nipples on regular guys.

OR  A urinary track infection (UTI)  OR  An STD    Either way, you should get tested.  Go to the clinic and submit a urine sample.    If it burns when you urinate, then it's most probably a UTI.  Don't wait for it to get in your kidney's.|`|1zQB6546aa	Take a urine sample to the doctors and ask them to test it - you could have a UTI for example, Cystitis which will need anti-biotics.  I have had this infection so many times and even had it so bad once that I weed pure blood.    Are you having any pain in your bladder when you pass urine as this is another sure sign of infection?  But the sooner you get to the doctors the sooner they can test it to see what the cause is.    Added: I just read that it stings when you pee - I would say it sounds VERY like cystitis to me.

V7bud1Lqaa	You're not abnormal.Some girls start their period as late as the age of 17.|`|LbovVj41aa	Because you are very active, that could be the cause.  Ask your self these questions (if you can)  When did your mom get it?  When did your older sister get it?  Do you weigh under 100 pounds?  Are you overweight?    You usually don't get your period until you're over 100 pounds.  When your mom and or older sister got there's that's when you're probably going to get yours.  If you're overwight it could throw that out of wack.  You will get your period.  It just is a matter of time until you get it.    Good Luck! Periods Suck!  |`|AA10072754	everyone starts at a different time.  I started at 10 and some of my other friends started at 14 and 15.  Don't feel left out.

Some girls only start at 16  If your breasts have started developing, you can expect to start any time in the next two years  Don't worry about being a late starter, it just means you have one less thing to worry about|`|AxDrEMB4aa	Lots of exercising can affect whether or not you get your period. Many women in the olympics or have joined the military (and do boot camp) work out so often they no longer get their periods.But the chances of these affecting yours are not good. Keep being active. Also, most girls have to be at least 100 lbs before they get their first period. From your bra size, which is fairly small and very normal for a 13 year old, it seems that your period will be coming eventually. Look for other signs such as pubic hair, underarm hair, vaginal discharge (a big sign!!), and your breasts developing and hips spreading out a bit. All of these will give you a bit of a heads up.    Honestly though, having a period is absolutely no fun! But I also understand how it feels to be left out and unfortunately periods can seem like a rite of passage. Keep hanging in there because your turn is not far behind!! you are at the perfect age to start.|`|5gANvXyTaa	My friends mom did not get it until she was 18! weird and you are what 13 so dont worry about..i just got mine like 3 months ago and i am 13 and was 13 at the time (131/2) but dont worry...and all my friends had it too before i did....including my friend whose mom did not get it till she was 18....and i wanted to get it to..but when i did i changed my mind lol.|`|0FGuV9Oyaa	Doing high activity sports like gymnastics can make your period come later, all of my friends have it too and i don't, but they all say you dont want it so i am going to believe it for now.  |`|JiPfgn3Zaa	Actually, most girls start around 12 or 13.

It is more important that the girl and her partner are both mature enough to do so. It's also important that both partners are willing and completely comfortable with eachother. But if you need an age put on it, I would say at age 18, when a person is considered an adult, it is perfectly fine and no one should question his or her decision to do so. However, before then can also be okay depending on the person.|`|CV8KIpIxaa	well heres my story...    im 13. and not a virgin. totally regret every single minute of it.

So St Paul asked us to keep our body (and spirit) well for God's sake.    It isn't easy but if we pray to the Holy Spirit He would help us.

I wish I had waited.|`|Ut2MoCNLaa	There are many factors to consider when answering this question.  a) The country the person lives in.  b) The cultural norms she lives with.  c) Religion.  d) Socio-economic conditions.  and there are some others....    In most Western nations where the Judeo-Christian values are prominent, there is no real "age" for her to lose her virginity. The best time is when she "feels" it is correct, she is not being pressured into it by her boy-friend or by her peers. Some will say when she is married whilst others will say when she is in a good long-term relationship.    In other countries it is considered "acceptable" when the girl is married, and that can be 9 y.o. in some African communities, and before the girl has had her menses; 12 in some countries or shortly after she has had her menses. In other countries like India it may be around 15 while in other countries it may be between 16-18.  In all these countries it is unacceptable for her to have sex without being married unless she is a prostitute.    As a journalist I have seen 12 year old Indonesian, Pakistani and Afghan girls who were married. In Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Thailand I have seen 16 year-olds being married and even attended several of the weddings.    Also, as a journalist I have seen girls in Indonesia working as prostitutes as young as 12 and know of cases where 6 y.o. were employed as prostitutes.  In Cambodia girls as young as 5 are working as prostitutes (oral sex until they are approximately 10 then they start having vaginal sex), and most are actually Vietnamese girls. In Thailand it is common for girls as young as 12 to work in brothels. In India it is also common to find 12 y.o. Nepalese girls working in brothels.    I do not believe a girl should be forced to work as a prostitute/sex-slave, no matter her age, but I can understand a girl over 15 going into the trade voluntarily to support her family in a war-zone or in other economically poor times.  |`|LTWe1BdWaa	I think if you are 15 or over and in love then it's ok|`|hqBPRSenaa	Whenevery they feel ready.

But left alone, both might die. Treatment here is not abortion but premature delivery. This attempts to save both lives.|`|AA10072754	Well it will save a mother's life if she is pregnant and in late 2nd or 3rd mester.

3yvuMkzTaa	In my opinion tiger balm, ULTRA STRENGTH, is by far the best!!!!|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	Bengay usually has a weaker odor than Tiger Balm which is infamous for its strong smell. I usually prefer tiger balm because I can actually feel it working on my joints. It is a really reliable product, even with the smell (which I actually enjoy). Bengay is usually used more for inflammation related pain like arthritis while TIger Balm is for almost any kind of pain. Its great stuff, I carry a small jar of Tiger Balm in my backpack every day. 
yEMRPW1Aaa	alot of people get it in different ways we just react different to them. i had plenty of them not to long ago and i usaully feel fear,shaky,sweaty and heart pounding out of my chest. and yes man and women can get the same panic attacks.|`|4eL7C596aa	I would guess and say that they are different for each one of us.......no matter what sex.

I hate having chest problems it wont go away! |`|XnNhY38Taa	Negative emotions (like sadness, stress, anger, etc.) causes your Serotonin production to be low; when your Serotonin level is low, you are more prone to getting Anxiety, Panic Attacks, Depression, etc.    Medication like Antidepressants (SSRI - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor) helps to boost Serotonin level.  But there are natural ways to do it without medication. There's this herb called "St John's Wort" - it is said to be more effective than Prozac. No, it is not for mild depression only and ignore those sayings. In fact, it does help anxiety and panic-attacks as St John's Wort works like prozac. Other natural ways will be exercise, diet, more exposure to light, etc.  If you're unable to take St John's Wort, you can substitute it with Siberian Ginseng or Licorice Herb.    The problem is that, even if your Serotonin is balanced... you have that "learned behavior" in your mind. You need to break that initial cycle to destroy that learned behavior - Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) does this. A technique that you can use without CBT will be Distraction... There are several other techniques to help cope them!  Ok, to use Distraction: Firstly, try to....

RtRYHKpDaa	Many sex toy websites will send you sex toys without any signs of what it is on the packaging.    You can use a faucet in a bath (run warm water which over the clitoris)...or even your fingers. |`|nAK8bm91aa	Use a dam cucumber lmao here omg|`|oW4xX5okaa	In addition to the other answers,    an electric toothbrush is a nice 'homemade' vibrator. Remove the bristle part and place the metal bar on your clitoris (this is intense, if you want a little less stimulation press the back part against your clitoris)    I am in the same boat as you. I am totally into sexual exploration but am not old enough to buy any sex toys.    Just a note..the toothbrush is for clitoral stimulation, not vaginal.|`|w2IL32hkaa	I really dont know how to get one without your parents knowing. but try a vibrating tooth brush.     Household items:    1. Sharpie marker with cap on and on the opposite side of the lid.    2. Banana, Zuchini, cucumber    3. Fingers    4. Pillow    5. Bottle      6. Top of nailpolish    Good luck |`|pwZXAHgWaa	Many girls enjoy using vegetables or other food products down there. Cucumber and Zucchini being a favorite because of their size and the fact that they are generally phallic (penis shaped). Just make sure that it is CLEAN!     If that's not your thing, ordering a vibrator online is a great way to get it without your parents knowing. Generally when you order things like sex toys from an online store, they will ship it with a discreet label like "battery powered toy" or "gel insert". Some people MIGHT know what these labels mean, but it's not likely.|`|SUa9Uf73aa	I don't know how "young" you are, but please make sure you read up on what to use/not use.  On a more positive note, this is a smarter and safer (physically/mentally/emotionally) decision than entering the world of teenage sex.|`|cd6mDlc9aa	well you don't need a vibrator, i have never had one. i use my fingers on my clit, while using a small flashlight, a hairbrush handle or anything like that that will work in my vagina to simulate a penis thrusting in my vagina. |`|hPeSK59zaa	Ask for one for christmas|`|AA10072754	as far as I know some adult stores don't ID you inside the actual store but just certain areas.  Even then they will still let you buy stuff.    Household stuff shouldn't be used cause it can damage or get stuck in places.  Then your parents will defiantly know lol.  If you purchase with cash then there is no documentation of you buying it|`|FvwmRtNjaa	Electric toothbrushes, showerheads, bathtub faucets.    As for getting a vibrator, make an adult friend.|`|iJ7MNucbaa	Get a crest spin brush. Put the back it if on your clit. It feels great!

Either way you will need to consult a veterinarian to help clear it up.|`|nckpVDcRaa	go to the vet.  Don't use anything over the counter, you'll probably just make it worse.  Go to the vet.
lmcxefEgaa	You must find the real problem that is causing her depression. Whether that problem is physical or emotional, family or friends. etc.    It may be tough to "get to her" but you need to re-assure her that you are willing to do whatever it takes to make her feel better. You are her boyfriend, not only are you a friend but she should have deep feelings for you. It may take a while for her to open up, but I do not doubt that she will finally tell you anyways.     When she does open up to you and reveals what her depression is about, you need to also re-assure her that you can do anything to make it work for her; If she feels like she is stuck with something and can't get rid of her problem, you need to do the best you can to "fix the kink" and make the problem seem miniscule. Though if there is not much that you can do, do your best to comfort her and tell her that you will be with her every step of the way. (Though try and find as many ways as to fix the problem.)    Try not to sound like the know it all either, don't constantly tell her what is right and what is wrong. What you need to do is guide her path so that she can get on her own feet again and let her feel that she has control. Because if you do everything, then it might make her feel even more depressed because she may feel that she can't do it by herself. You need to be her "leaning post" not a someone who will constantly cover for her. (Not that covering for her once in a while is a good thing, but you need to make sure that she feels like she is worth something as well.)|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	My boyfriend suffered from depression for a long time (and still does). 1)Make sure she gets help and possibly medication  2)Make sure that she does not rely solely on you for happiness, that will just depress both of you  3)Support her through her therapy  4)Be there  5)Don't be her therapist, be her partner, there is a difference    The most important of these is the first one, get her help. If she isn't seeing a therapist already then get her to one. If she isn't on a depression medication already then she may want to see a psychiatrist and talk about one. |`|RLLASsIvaa	Well, you should do your best to support her if you care about her. What exactly is the problem? Be more specific.|`|vAlzeeznaa	get another girlfriend  duh|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Haha, I only laugh because I have depression and it drives my fiance crazy. Either you're going to have to learn to be sensitive when she's particularly down, how to cheer her up, and how to be supportive or you're going to have to move on because it's only making the both of your worse for it. My fiance usually says something too funny for me not to laugh at when I'm down. He tells me sometimes "In this house we make our crankies outside with the puppies!" and I end up laughing which relieves the stress and then it's hard to remember why I was so sad in the first place. A lot of the time she will just be sad with no reason, if you can break it up a bit then she'll be able to "reset." Anyway, encourage her to see a doctor if she hasn't already and she'll be able to live a normal life with you if you so please. |`|nALSqqccaa	It's really hard.  Believe me, my sister's boyfriend (my sister has depression) is always impatient with her and stuff.   But what a lot of people don't understand is that sometimes when your girlfriend is sad and can't seem to snap out of it, it's not that shes whiny, it's that she really can't snap out of it.      The most you can do for her is be there to support her, be there to talk to her when she's having problems, and maybe look up depression so that you can understand it a little better.

mAp90hEeaa	There is no easy way to get rid of a sore throat.  You can take tylenol or ibuprofen on a regular basis, gargle with warm salt water and spit out as often as you want, rest as much as possible, increase your fluid intake - often cold feels best, run a humidifier in the bedroom where you sleep.  If the sore throat gets progressively worse, consider getting a strep test done to make sure this isn't a bacterial infection.  Expect this to take a week or more before it goes away.|`|f1958dce4135a2864bf4bbbc09a66a86aa	gargle with warm salt water. It is also good to drink chamomile tea with some honey. Ricola has some great throat lozenges. |`|kryXv3oyaa	u could mix water and a bunch of salt then gargle it for 10 seconds!!      -DONT SWALLOW IT- or you could drink some hot tea with some honey in it!! -no sugar like we did when you were over at my house lol-    NOT A STALKER WERE LIKE BEST FRIENDS|`|ffafd5ee2fbfdbeee819ac5f6185c153aa	Drink tea with honey, that is very soothing. Also gargling with salt water that may help breakup any bacteria. If this sore throat is accompanied by fever or came on quickly - within 24 hours- you may need to see a doctor. Also if your house is not humidified, try adding humidity by a vaporizer in your room at night, that will help.  Throat lozenges also provide short term relief. Good luck and get well soon.

WejTlNZBaa	no she will not tell her.  just be honest with the doctor about you sex life, and ask that the doctor keep your confidence.|`|x3EPqezJaa	No the doc will not tell her. It's confidential. The doc also can't detect if you're a virgin or not, though YOU should tell the doctor, because it's important to keep the doc apprised of your situation for your own health benefit--the doc will want to do a sexually transmitted disease screen and a pap smear. Also, your mother might already suspect, and that's why she set up the appointment. Don't have sex for 48 hours before the appointment, because having sex can mess up your test results.|`|AA10072754	Mine never told my parents.  What was said and happened in the room stayed in the room.

Talk to her before you go there saying that you're scared to go already-- and that you don't want the pressure of her in there causing you to get more nervous!

AA11112224	You need to add at least 30-45 minutes of cardio 4-5 days a week. Even though you may not be or look fat, there may be small amounts of fat covering up those muscles, so cardio is the only way to get rid of it. Cardio is also a good overall workout for you whole body and heart/lungs.     And yes, what you eat is a big one. Ever heard the saying you are what you eat? I believe that is true. You need to change around your outlook on eating, part of getting in shape has to do with what's in the kitchen. Eat whole grains, get in your fresh fruits (2-3 servings daily, smoothies are great, just don't add sugar), veggies (3-5 servings daily) and of course your dairy. Cut out all fried foods, refined foods (white bread, bleached flour), & sugars and artificial sweeteners. Think of food as a way to gain energy, not as a way of life and as a social habit. The more you eat when you are just "hungry" and not when you are bored, the better your habits will become. Don't completely deprive yourself though, if you have to have something sweet, eat a small cookie , etc. Depriving yourself completely will just drive you insane, and when you do give in for a treat, you are twice as likely to eat more of the bad things.    Hope this helps and good luck!|`|ZtchMhdWaa	well you said you're looking to gain some muscle?? As far as eating goes you need a lot of protein. you should actually eat more calories than you expend in order to put some muscle on. Some of it should be carbs, some should be good fats, and most should be protein.     carbs should be whole grain carbs. no white potatoes (sweet potatoes are good), no white rice, white bread -- such and such. substitute with whole grains, browns, and wheat. white starchy carbs are ok once a while though.     fats should come from like fish, olive oil, nuts - so on. and protein should be lean meats, chicken turkey, lean red meats. some of the things i like to eat to get my protein intake is     jerky, peanut butter, chicken, tuna, turkey, occasional steak, whey protein powders, tofu -- things like that.     also start lifting heavy. heavier weights and lower reps are awesome for building muscle. and than once you've bulked you can switch to lower weights, higher reps for shaping the muscle.  you can also do some of ab exercises with weights to make you work harder too.

DVmDWDC4aa	Do you actually hear the voices, or is it more of a thought?    If it's a thought, then yes it sounds like OCD. If you hear the voices I'd be more concerned.    Either way, you should go and see a doctor. If it's really getting to you, a short course of pills can really make a difference and get your mind out of that habit.     The doctors see it all the time, I had it too, so don't feel awkward about telling them.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	Hey there,     It is a symptom of OCD. Google OCD to find out more about it. Are you experiencing any other OCD traits? 13thRowP... is right. You should see your doctor or a psychologist. He or she would help you to access this issue like whether there is anything in particular which increase them as 13thRowP... said. Or you may email me if you are not ready to speak with a professional at the moment.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	It could be OCD, but there are other mental conditions that cause similar symptoms.    In fact, there are physical conditions that can cause them as well. It's a good idea to get bloodwork to make sure you aren't deficient & all your levels are within normal ranges. There likely will be routine in-office tests he performs as well.     Discuss the exact symptoms w/your doctor: length of time, what seems to cause the voices, anything in particular increase them, anything decrease them or make them go away, is it a variety of voices, etc. (also is it others voice(s) in your head or is it your voice in your head)    There's no need to be worried about what the doctor will think; this is a medical condition & they are accustomed to these things. The doctor can identify what the problem is & offer you sources of treatment. The general public doesn't understand these illnesses, how they begin or how they progress, so it's best to see your doctor.|`|5aKUV5afaa	I get voices in my head all the time.  Usually it's, better turn the frying pan that way, someone may grab it and get hurt.  Better get that toy off the stair, someone may get hurt.  It's always in my head.
M63kq3AYaa	Half native American puts you similar musculature to Asian people (in general), be glad of it, it means you've got great to perfect physical condition to learn Martial arts better than most other races.|`|e1GCbGrXaa	How you exercise your muscles (even as a child) will determine whether they grow more towards bigger or stronger. Short bursts will tone them and help grow stronger such as if you lift boxes around a house and so on. Longer strains will increase their size. Its the basics of weight lifting. Women normally do shorter bursts so they dont end up ripped|`|Ai7O5hiBaa	Everybody's different and this is just another case of that. You have naturally wiry muscles and there isn't a whole lot you can do. You can work the show muscles more (do dumbell rows helps) but if people don't think you're strong you have an advantage, keep it.
8WP9Gu1saa	Brew a strong coffee or chocolate and drink this before you start  working.  It will perk you up and put you on hyper because of its caffeine content.  If still you feel sleepy have someone to watch you and wake you up say after 30 minutes of nap.  That is all you need, a stolen sleep can keep you going for hours. If you can find someone to wake you up, keep an alarm handy beside you and a cup of black coffee or choco just to give you a jolt you need to finish your work. But always remember, your body will make you pay in the end after this.

Es soll auch nicht auffallen, dass nicht nur das Zigarettenrauchen fr Lungenkrebs zust?ndig ist, sondern viele andere Umwelteinflsse, vor allen Dingen solche, die von der Arbeitsstelle und von den Autos und vielem anderen ausgeht.

Ich gestehe, ich habe mir als ehemaliger Raucher auch nicht genug Gedanken darber gemacht, habe aber nie in Gegenwart von Kranken oder Kinder geraucht.

Ich denke es sollte verbieten werden weil wir uns selber damit kaputt machen!  Und wir werden immer schtiger!  Gute Frage!  Tschau  Teddy|`|7cf69301ae2502d9f218951a0aedd936aa	Ein Verbot (denke an das Alkoholverbot in Amerika) w?re keine gute L?sung. Es hat eine enorme Kriminalit?t (Al Capone) erm?glicht Jeder sollte frei entscheiden k?nnen ob er rauchen will oder nicht. Im Falle eines tats?chlichen Verbots wrde es geheim geschehen und zu etwas aussergew?hnlichen tradieren, wie auch schon bei anderen Drogen zu beobachten. Es wrde wieder cool werden.   Die Trennung zwischen Rauchern und Nichtrauchern ist zu akzeptieren solange es Lokale fr Raucher und welche fr Nichtraucher gibt. Da kann jeder entscheiden in welches Lokal er gehen will. Ein Verbot fr alle Lokale, wie in Italien, finde ich nicht sinnvoll. Eine Teilung innerhalb eines Lokals ist meist nicht ausreichend die Nichtraucher zu schtzen.   In Gegenwart von Kindern aber sollte das Rauchen immer unterlassen werden. Mtter mit Baby im Arm und Zigarette waren mir schon immer ein Greul.|`|6bc3ecca9ed8606a2e7fc9aaa775afe0aa	Nein, das bringt nix. Ich habe selber 30 Jahre lang geraucht. aber ich habe angefangen, u.a. weil die Raucherecke in der Schule damals toleriert wurde, und weil ich trotz meiner damals 14 Jahre Zigaretten aus dem Automaten bekommen habe.  90% aller Zigarettenautomaten von Europa h?ngen in Deutschland und da kann jeder ran. Die sollten verboten werden, ebenso das Rauchen in allen ?ffentlichen Geb?uden, damit sich die Raucher darber klar werden, dass sie andere Menschen sch?digen. Au?erdem braucht es wesentlich mehr Entw?hnungskurse auf Kasse.|`|88c303988425353d7449c4481c732a5faa	Ja!

Die Nichtraucher kriegen ja schon fast selber eine Raucherlunge, wenn jemand st?ndig neben ihm raucht!!|`|bcf316ed978f1e040e4192e68f1da4bcaa	Auf jeden Fall!    Ich finde das Raucher nicht nur sich sondern auch der Umwelt und anderen Menschen schaden.   Wie viele Kinder rauchen Zuhause passiv mit, weil die Eltern genau vor den Kindern rauchen? Wenn nicht ein generelles Rauchverbot, dann doch zumindest eins fr Eltern.  Au?erdem geht es auch um das Geld. Es wird soviel Geld fr Tabak ausgegeben.  Auf der anderen Seite weiss ich sehr gut, dass man einem Raucher nicht einfach sagen kann, das er jetzt aufh?ren soll zu rauchen.     Deswegen w?re der erste Schritt, kostenlose Beratungen und ggf. Entziehungs-Seminare oder Kuren, seitens der Regierung anzubieten. Dann wrden unsere Steuergelder mal fr was sinvolles eingesetzt werden. Der zweite Schritt w?re, ein Rauchverbot fr Eltern zu verh?ngen, damit Kinder geschtzt werden. Der dritte Schritt w?re dann, das Rauchen in der ?ffentlichkeit zu verbieten.  Und ich denke hier sollte man halt machen. Denn genau das generelle Rauchverbot wrde eine Sache werden, die nur schwer durchzusetzen w?re. Auch meine oben erl?uterten drei Schritte sind sicherlich nicht einfach durchzusetzen, aber ich denke damit sollte man es dann auch belassen.    Man kann niemandem verbieten etwas zu tun, solange er nur sich damit schadet. Man kann es ihm aber verbieten wenn er damit andere schadet.|`|c3f0e210f0894e5ac240411846587fd6aa	Generell verbieten - da bin ich dagegen.    Aber es sollte unterbunden werden, da? Kinder so einfach drankommen an den Tabak.    Sie k?nnen ja nicht wissen, wie schwierig es ist, von etwas, was es an jeder Stra?enecke zu ziehen gibt, wieder abzukommen, wenn sie damit aufh?ren m?chten.    Drum bin ich dafr, die ?ffentlichen Automaten wegzumachen und Tabakwaren nur noch wie Alkohol an mind. 16-j?hrige in L?den (wenn n?tig mit Ausweiskontrollen) zu verkaufen.|`|da09966566720c0b5624ed2017409e3eaa	Nein, Drogen sollten generell entkriminalisiert werden.|`|d2605a9d472634d14f74ea48833a25b9aa	nein

Alternative names include Cushag, Tansy Ragwort, St. James-wort, Ragweed, Stinking Nanny/Ninny/Willy, Staggerwort, Dog Standard, Cankerwort, Stammerwort and Mare's Fart. In the western US it is generally known as "Tansy Ragwort", or even more confusingly "Tansy", though its resemblance to the true tansy is superficial at best.

(For the North American species, see Packera obovata.)    Alternative names include Cushag, Tansy Ragwort, St. James-wort, Ragweed, Stinking Nanny/Ninny/Willy, Staggerwort, Dog Standard, Cankerwort, Stammerwort and Mare's Fart. In the western US it is generally known as "Tansy Ragwort", or even more confusingly "Tansy", though its resemblance to the true tansy is superficial at best. This is a potentially dangerous misuse of names, since the true tansy has been used for culinary purposes.    Ragwort can be found along road sides and waste grounds, and grows in all cool and high rainfall areas.    The Ragwort is native to the Eurasian continent. In Europe it is widely spread, from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean. In Britain it is listed as a weed. In the USA it has been introduced, and is present mainly in the North West and North East: California, Idaho, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Washington.    In South America it grows in Argentina, in Africa in the north, and on the Asian continent in India and Siberia. It is widespread weed in New Zealand and Australia. In many Australian states ragwort has been declared a noxious weed. This status requires landholders to remove it from their property, by law.      That's My Best Answer! Hope it can help!

While its use has decreased in recent years due to the popularity of better-smelling and more readily-available over the counter products, it is still used by many hospitals, doctors and dentists in sterilising, cleaning and treating everything from floors to Root canal procedures.    Recently, alternative medical practitioners have advocated administering doses of hydrogen peroxide intravenously in extremely low (less than one percent) concentrations for hydrogen peroxide therapy  a controversial alternative medical treatment for cancer. However, according to the American Cancer Society, "there is no scientific evidence that hydrogen peroxide is a safe, effective or useful cancer treatment." They advise cancer patients to "remain in the care of qualified doctors who use proven methods of treatment and approved clinical trials of promising new treatments." [4] Internal use of hydrogen peroxide has a history of causing fatal blood disorders, and its recent use as a therapeutic treatment has been linked to several deaths.[5],[6]    Hydrogen peroxide is GRAS (Generally Recognised As Safe) as an antimicrobial agent, an oxidizing agent and more by the US Food and Drug Administration.[7] Hydrogen peroxide can also be used as a toothpaste when mixed with correct quantities of baking soda and salt.[8] Like benzoyl peroxide, hydrogen peroxide is also sometimes used in the treatment of acne.    Hydrogen peroxide is also seen in some alternative medicine treatments. Joseph Mercola recommends pouring small amounts into the ear canal as a method of treating colds.

Change your eating habits (i.e. start eating smaller portions of food) before if you ate a full plate of food try eating 2/3 of a plate instead.  2.    o Substitute aspartame for sugar  o Try eating 3 or 4 smaller meals during the day rather than 2 large ones  o Eat your main large meal at midday with the other meals much smaller in content  o Don't eat heavy meals late in the evening as the body wont have time to digest it so it ends up stored as fat in your body.  o Balance your meals out during the day so in one day you have a mix of protein, carbohydrate and vitamins  o Drink lots of water during the day and before, during and after exercise, you should drink at least 8 big glasses of water per 24 hours  o Drink alcohol in moderation  o Stop smoking if you smoke or cut down  o Eat more fibre i.e. pulses grains nuts, pasta, brown rice, cereals, fresh fruit  o Eat more vegetables as part of your diet  o Eat less dairy products or choose those with less fat content i.e. cottage cheese  o Try steaming or poaching food instead of frying it, frying adds calories by the bucketful  o Cut down on Red meat and eat more lean or better still chicken and fish instead  o Use low fat oils in cooking i.e. sunflower, corn or Mazola  o Cut down on your salt intake, there are hidden salts even in tinned foods  o Try substituting carrots or fresh fruit instead of biscuits and sweetmeat when you have a craving for something in between meals.  o Drink semi or skimmed milk as opposed to full cream  Simply choose a diet which is low in fat and cholesterol, moderate in sugar and salt and high in fibre but at the same time has a variety of everything thus making it a balanced diet.    Calculate your BMR!!!!  BMR means Basal Metabolic Rate.It is used to estimate how many calories you should consume.By using a simple formula called the Harris-Benedict principle, you can assess your BMR.  Your BMR is the amount of energy your body needs to function.Then, to lose weight, you'll need to cut calories or burn extra calories and shoot for a level lower than the results you get with this formula.   We use about 60 percent of the calories we consume each day for basic bodily functions such as breathing.Other factors that influence your BMR are height, weight, age and sex.  Step One : Calculate your BMR with the following formula:  ? Women: BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)  ? Men: BMR = 66 + (6.23 x weight in pounds) + (12.7 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)  Step two : In order to incorporate activity into your daily caloric needs, do the following calculation:  ? If you are sedentary : BMR x 1.2  ? If you are lightly active: BMR x 1.375   ? If you are moderately active (You exercise most days a week.): BMR x 1.55   ? If you are very active (You exercise daily.): BMR x 1.725   ? If you are extra active (You do hard labor or are in athletic training.): BMR x 1.9  Create a Calorie Deficit:  In order to lose weight, you must create a calorie deficit. It is easier and healthier to cut back your calorie intake a little bit at a time.  Every 3,500 calories is equivalent to 1 pound.   If you cut back 500 calories a day, you will lose 1 pound per week.  If you exercise to burn off 500 calories a day you will also lose 1 pound per week.  Ideally, you should do a combination of both, (e.g. cut back 250 calories; burn an extra 250 calories).      For more useful information go to   read the following articles

Como temos glandulas sudorparas suamos e a umidade  um ambiente bem propicio para a prolifera??o de fungos e bactrias.  Aconselho a usar menos sapatos fechados e se precisar faz-lo alternar os dias de uso com os demais cal?ados. Deixe-os no sol para eliminar a umidade,caso n?o possa lav-los com frequncia.  No dia a dia, use sabonete anti-bactericida tipo protex.  Tbm aconselho a boa e antiga minancora.  N?o esque?a que ao lavar os ps, precisa enxugar bem entre os dedos. Procure esfoliar os ps com lixa e aplicar um creme tipo minancora ou a base de canfora ou mentol.Use sempre meias.  Lembre-se que n?o adianta tomar todos os cuidados e esquecer de ter o mesmo cuidado com a higiene dos cal?ados.Os microorganismos presentes voltar?o atac-lo.

This is what you should do:  sit down in a quiet place, and grab a pencil and piece of paper.  Title it "Things I like"  Write down things you like, then look at your list.  Find something that is quiet and stress free.  Don't pick something like "boxing"... unless you think getting beat up is stress free lol.    Try some jazz music or some classical (I know some of it sucks, but there are tons that are good to listen).  A candle may help you too.  Drawing and doing art is very relaxing especially if you have some soft music.  Another good thing is a good view. For example, going to the beach at night with the moon and stars out is extremely relaxing, especially when the nice breeze comes in.      Good luck man
FEOCoBmGaa	As minhas depressoes eu procuro controlar e ate curar-las assim;     Busco analisar todo meu passado e ver qual os momentos e experiencias que me causou e causa depressao.   procuro refletir sobre essas experiencias. entao  tiro para um lado o que me serve de ajuda por ter aprendido o que nao sabia para crescer como pessoa mais responsavel no que me envolvo. e tiro para o outro lado o que nao me serve de maneira alguma e me faz estar me concentrando em algo que so me faz mau. dai excluo o lado que pesa dos meus pensamentos, dar trabalho, por que se estar a educar a mente a filtrar,  mais sim e possivel, assim cada vez que o pensamento que causa mau vem eu mudo para um outro positivo, com o tempo a propria mente se abitua a seguir assim e automaticamente esses pensamentos que fazem o mau sao parados quando os vem, e deixo viajar na mente so os que me serve e nao me pesa.  assim por milagre divino se ver a depressao ser trocada por um prazer de busca no que e positivo. assim milagrosamente estamos bem! amem    boa sorte|`|tNYGOX7faa	Ol amigo .  A depress?o  uma DOEN?A progressiva mas curvel .  Trata-se de uma disfun??o de uma substancia responsvel por liga??es neurais , ou seja , seu corpo passa a produzir substancias responsveis pelo prazer inclusive , de forma deficiente ou pode ainda n?o funcionar adequadamente enquanto  isso .  Todavia n?o se prenda ao aspecto funcional da doen?a mas sim de como curar .  A depress?o pode ser curada sem intera??o medicamentosa, mas para isso um psiclogo deve ser consultado j que somente um profissional qualificado pode avaliar a extens?o e progresso da doen?a . Se for necessria a intera??o medicamentosa o psiclogo pode agir (limitadamente segundo meu conhecimento) mas nesse caso o melhor a fazer  procurar um psiquiatra, pois este sim trata com intera??es do tipo , medicando com intuito de reestabelecer essas substancias que por algum motivo n?o est?o normais em seu organismo .    Na minha opini?o eu tentaria resolver sem o auxlio de medicamentos e somente com psiclogos , mas somente o profissional pode avaliar pois cada caso  um caso isolado e com intera??es diferenciadas .    Complementando , vale lembrar que uma dieta saudvel com exerccios fsicos regulares pode auxiliar no combate  doen?a e tambm na preven??o .(j que com exerccios fsicos existe a libera??o de substancias benficas ao indivduo)  Importante procurar sempre estar em situa??es agradveis com pessoas de quem se gosta , isso contribui muito para a melhoria do quadro da doen?a , somos seres sociveis.

Aprender a tirar o mximo proveito da gua, pode fazer uma grande diferen?a ao sem bem-estar.    A gua  rica em nutrientes importantes  Uma das caractersticas mais fantsticas da gua  que ela tem pouco sdio, nada de gordura, nada de colesterol e nada de calorias. Embora a gua ofere?a todas essas vantagens, infelizmente, pessoas de maneira geral n?o consomem diariamente a quantidade necessria para obter uma vida saudvel. O ser humano, em mdia, deveria ingerir 8 copos dgua por dia. (Pegue seu peso e divida por 25).    N?o deixe seu corpo desidratado  Seu organismo pode perder at 2 copos de gua por dia, por meio da transpira??o. Por isso  t?o importante compensar essa perda. Fazer exerccios tambm aumenta as necessidades de gua do organismo, que pode chegar at 3,7 litros de gua a mais por dia. Ent?o o que podemos fazer para garantir que o nosso corpo receba a quantidade de gua de que precisa? O melhor mtodo  consumir lquidos gradualmente - ao longo do dia  em vez de tentar tomar grande quantidade de gua de uma s vez.    Beber gua ajuda a diminuir o seu apetite  A gua pode ser uma parte importante do seu plano nutricional e uma ferramenta muito til no controle de peso. A capacidade da gua de diminuir o nosso apetite , provavelmente, um dos seus efeitos mais visveis. Se voc beber a quantidade de gua recomendada todos os dias, vai se sentir mais satisfeito (a) e provavelmente n?o ter tanta vontade de beliscar.    Reten??o de lquido e elimina??o de toxinas  Algumas pessoas se preocupam com a reten??o de lquidos no organismo. Na verdade, a ingest?o regular de gua  uma das coisas que ajudam a prevenir esse problema. O que ocorre  que o corpo desidratado entende a falta de gua como uma amea?a e, por isso, tende a armazenar gua! Ent?o quanto mais gua voc beber, maior ser a elimina??o de toxinas indesejveis do seu organismo o que ajuda seu corpo a funcionar melhor.|`|77d5c95abe576c616fe85b30d4553636aa	Aumenta, esse eh o problema do sal tb.

L'intelligenza  qualcosa di meraviglioso, ma ha un problema: ti appiccica addosso un sacco di RESPONSABILITA'. Perch se capisci, se sai, non hai pi scuse: devi trovare il modo di agire per il meglio, sempre.  E questo non  mica facile,  una gran scocciatura,  un peso che non sempre si ha voglia di portarsi in giro.    Non a caso molti, non avendo voglia di ingegnarsi, di rischiare, di FARE, si atteggiano a stupidi, a scemotti, a poco svegli, evitando cos di doversi esporre e mettere in gioco. Fingendo poca intelligenza.    Certo, capire e sapere pu ANCHE provocarci dolore, smarrimento, momenti di sfiducia, ma ci permette soprattutto - e pi facilmente - di accettare queste cose, di farcene una ragione. E, facendone tesoro, di fare esperienza.    "I tre quarti dei problemi delle persone intelligenti provengono dalla loro intelligenza". Ecco, questo voleva dire, forse.     Furbastro.

yZOh66lMaa	TB is transmitted by the inhalation of airborne organisms. Infectious particles are generated when individuals with pulmonary TB, (e.g., individuals with infection involving lung tissues, respiratory airways, or larynx), cough, sneeze, or speak. Procedures, such as cough induction or bronchoscopy, are associated with an increased generation of infectious, aerosolized particles. Once infectious particles are aerosolized, they are spread throughout a room or building by air currents and can be inhaled by another individual. Initially, the particles are sufficiently large that they can be trapped by the respiratory system of the person inhaling them. As the exhaled particles remain airborne they become dehydrated and decrease until they are one to five microns in size. Particles of this size are called droplet nuclei. These droplet nuclei can avoid the defence system of the upper airway and bronchi and can reach the alveoli where infection can occur.    TB transmission is unlikely to occur from individuals with extrapulmonary TB because infectious particles are usually not aerosolized. Aerosolization may, however, occur in selected laboratory and autopsy procedures or during certain activities, such as the irrigation of TB-infected wounds. Rarely has transmission been reported after injection or direct inoculation of infectious material. Tubercle bacilli on fomites (e.g., linen, furniture, books, and floors) are not infectious and are not a significant infection hazard.    Most people are unaware that they have become infected with TB. They are not ill and have no symptoms of illness because their immune system prevents the development of active TB. A positive tuberculin skin test (TST) may be the only indication that someone has "inactive" TB. People with a positive TST may revert to a negative TST over time, suggesting waning immunity (31) .    Approximately 10% of all individuals infected with M. tuberculosis develop active disease (TB) sometime during their life. The risk of developing active TB is greatest in the first 2 years after initial infection. Re-infection can occur, although this is uncommon (32-34) .      Risk of Transmission  The risk of transmission of TB from one individual to another is dependent upon the following: 1) the patient with active infection, 2) the environment, and 3) the susceptibility of the exposed person.    The patient with active infection    Factors related to the patient that enhance transmission and determine the patient's level of infectivity include, (in decreasing order of importance) the following:        * disease involving the lungs, airways, or larynx (e.g., pulmonary rather than extrapulmonary TB);        * presence of AFB on microscopic direct smear examination of the sputum [see Section IV.D.4] (patients who have a negative AFB sputum smear and who have a positive culture are less contagious, but may transmit infection (35) );        * presence of cavitation, extensive disease, or pneumonic infiltrates on chest radiograph of a patient with pulmonary TB;        * undergoing a procedure that can induce coughing or cause aerosolization of tubercle bacilli (e.g., sputum induction, bronchoscopy) in a patient with pulmonary TB; and        * presence of cough, sneeze, or other forceful expiratory manoeuvre in a patient with pulmonary TB.    Children have generally been considered to have a low risk of transmitting TB. They usually develop non-cavitary TB and frequently do not have a productive cough. However, children with TB have infected other individuals (35) .    The environment    Environmental factors that may enhance the likelihood of transmission (36) include the following:        * presence of someone with active TB who is not on effective therapy (undiagnosed, untreated, non-compliance with treatment, unrecognized drug resistance);        * exposure of susceptible individuals to an infectious person in a relatively small enclosed space;        * inadequate ventilation that results in either insufficient dilution or removal of infectious droplet nuclei;        * re-circulation of air containing infectious droplet nuclei; and        *  duration of exposure.The susceptibility of the exposed person    Some individuals are more susceptible to becoming infected with TB than others. HIV-infected individuals may have increased susceptibility (4) . Individuals with previous TB infection or who received a BCG vaccine are considered less susceptible. The effectiveness of BCG vaccination in adults, however, remains controversial. Meta analysis suggested that BCG is 50% effective in preventing the development of active disease in adults (37) .|`|177e87fbafb60c1577ce111604fae767aa	coughing. Its transmitted through droplets. Those with TB in a hospital are usually isolated and all medical staff wear masks and smocks. Droplets can travel up to 5 feet from the cougher so I'm a little neurotic about people coughing around me.|`|AA11800195	Any kind of contact with the person even their cough can affect you that's why they are isolated in the hospital and everyone talks to them through masks|`|98792c3237a20fa3a88f1cddb3f38421aa	It is transmited when someone has the active tuberculosis disease meaning that they can spread it to others.  It is spread by air--so once the person breaths, talks, sings, yawns anything that has to do with the mouth, and then you breath in the bacteria into your lungs.      If your have a good immune system you will develope TB latency inactive form and that means your body has stopped the TB from spreading, but it cannot kill it.  If later in life you get sick, get HIV/AID or something that weakens your immune system you could get TB active form (disease).      Of the people that have the TB inactive form 10% develop the active TB disease and of those that have the active disease 50% or more die.      Example:  200 people have TB inactive form  20 develop active TB disease  of the 20, 10 or more die.      You can check on www.wikipedia.com (search for tuberculosis) for more information|`|e212112a4de46842e3f75416b2280270aa	Much the same way a cold can be transmitted.  It can be airborne (through a cough) or through tiny germs left on surfaces.|`|HX3JC8Tpaa	Tuberculosis is spread through air droplets which are expelled when persons with infectious TB disease cough, sneeze, speak, or sing. Close contacts (persons with prolonged, frequent, or intense contact) are at highest risk of becoming infected (22% infection rate). Others at risk include foreign-born from areas where TB is common, residents and  employees of high-risk congregate settings, health care workers who serve high-risk clients, medically underserved, low-income populations, high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, children exposed to adults in high-risk categories, and persons who inject illicit drugs. The tuberculosis germ is carried on droplets in the air, and can enter the body through the airway. A person with active pulmonary tuberculosis can spread the disease by coughing or sneezing. The process of catching tuberculosis involves two stages: first, a person has to become infected; second, the infection has to progress to disease. To become infected, a person has to come in close contact with another person having active tuberculosis. In other words, the person has to breathe the same air in which the person with active disease coughs or sneezes.    Transmission occurs only from persons with active TB disease (not latent TB infection). A person has to come in contact with someone who has active TB disease with TB germs present in the sputum. The likelihood of this happening also depends on the time spent in close contact with the person with active disease. The process of infection progresses to disease in about ten percent of those infected, and it can happen any time during the remainder of their lives. Although the chance of progression to disease diminishes with the passage of time, tuberculosis can develop more easily if the immune system weakens, as happens with malnutrition, AIDS, diabetes, cancer, or treatment with immunosuppressant drugs. In people with both HIV and TB infection, as many as eight percent can develop TB each year. In the United States, about one person in every 5,500 is diagnosed as infected with tuberculosis.
d9fb1dd645e4f5559a0eee63dd4ba255aa	Spinning classes at a gym made me lose weight even in a Christmas holiday when I was eating loads!  At the moment I love the New York City Ballet workout - quite the opposite, I guess, but very good for toning as well as losing weight.  You don't say if you're male or female, but I don't see why men can't also enjoy this.  It will certainly give them muscles!    I have to differ from Kimmer4.  Muscle tissue burns more calories than fat, so if you exercise your body starts burning more calories, even when resting.  And did you know that if you go for a 30 minute jog, you metabolism doubles for the next 6 HOURS??  Also, exercise can be addictive, because you secrete feel-good hormones when working out, so just enjoy it!|`|AA12340145	fat *** get lipo suction|`|N6wLXvPiaa	you're probably sick of hearing this, but diet and excersize really are the key.

Drink green tea (it boosts your metabolism and makes you more active, and don't add any sugar)  4. Don't eat 3-4 hours prior to sleeping or after 6 pm  5. Avoid fried foods   6. Avoid cheese and dressings (mayo, ranch, etc.)  7. Cut out cookies/chips/candy  8. Chew on sugarless gum   9. Eat an apple every day  10. Keep yourself busy to keep your mind off of food (I like to clean, workout, wash my car, window shop, and etc.)  11. Workout consistently (try to work out (do cardio) 4 or 5 times a week for atleast 30 minutes)   12. Don't consume too much bread and pasta  13. Drink non fat milk   14. Find a workout buddy  15. Take the stairs instead of the escalator  16. Park further away so you'll be able to walk a further distance  17. Stay away from soda    I usually drink 3-4 cups of green tea a day. You can find green tea bags sold at your local grocery store. Chinese green tea is the best one for weight loss. Good luck!!|`|bb475022702b8b2fab4c209fe3889bccaa	A proper diet is the best way to lose weight naturally and keep it off. You have to eat a varied adequate and balanced diet. Your body needs all kinds of food to function properly including fat in smaller quantities though. Your body needs the nutrients and vitamins in fruits and vegetables the most, that is what you should eat the most of (at least 5 servings a day). You also need protein, and a little fat. Reduce your intake of sweets, fried food and foods that contain a lot of fat. Don't drink too many alcoholic beverages or soft drinks (they have a lot of calories). Don't go to sleep right after you eat. And finally exercise at least 3 to 4 days a week for about 45 minutes.Good luck.

Most common is the use of a hot spa pool/bath either in a clinical setting (hospital or therapy centre), at a public pool or at a health spa.    Sometimes strong jets of water is used as a form of massage but it is not as widely accepted.      A spa bath/pool is beneficial for people who have all kinds of medical conditions.. including cerebral palsy, spina bifida, after orthopaedic surgery, MS, autism & stroke victims... just to name a few.  Its very common for children to be treated with hydrotherapies.  This type of treatment should be performed by a qualified physiotherapist or trained carer.

bFExPY6oaa	You can Lose 9 lbs every 11 days after you know these facts:    Low Fat Foods DON'T WORK.........    You cannot lose weight using Low Fat Diets. Low fat foods have been popular for more than 15 years, but yet our society is getting more overweight as each year passes. This fact alone should tell you that eating a purely low fat menu is not the answer to losing weight.    Low Calorie Diets DON'T WORK........    You won't lose weight using a Low Calorie Dieting Plan either. In fact, eating low calories is the worst thing that you can do to your body, since that will only slow down your body's fat burning engine and ruin all chances of losing weight (low calorie diets may allow a few pounds of weight loss for the first few days, but then after that all weight loss comes to a halt --- known as a dieting plateau). You can never get slim by starving yourself.    Low Carb Plans DON'T WORK.......    You'll probably find it extremely difficult to get slim using a Low Carb Dieting Plan. Low carb diets have recently become popular over the last couple years, but the problem with low carb menus is that they are too strict and TOO HARD TO FOLLOW for average people. Low carb menus tend to rob your body of too much energy (carbohydrates) and make it nearly impossible to remain on the program for very long. This is why so many dieters find it difficult to follow a strict low carbohydrate menu.    In fact,the food that you eat can either make you THIN or FAT!!!    come here,,,,    http://www.yesloseweight.com    It will tell you the whole secret of weight loss and it will tell you how to lose weight by eating Chicken,Fish Filet,Cottage Cheese,sandwich and so on.You can find weight loss is so easy and so happy!!!|`|5b60cf8bba9d0e82014b5a70f1c32970aa	How old and tall are you?  I do really need to know your age and how tall you are but I can tell you this. . .    First of all please don't go on a fad diet. . . the weight will come off easily but then you'll gain the weight again soon. What you need to do is exersize daily-around half an hour to an hours worth and remember you only start burning fat after half an hour of exersize, any exersize less than half an hour is just burning glucose. A good routine is about 5 mins of streching, run for 30 mins, 100 crunches, 100 sit-ups, 30 push-ups and stretch again at the end for 5 mins.    Then you need to start eating less-some people like three small meals a day or you can have 5-6 even smaller meals if you snack a lot. But try not to snack on unhealthy options-go for fruit or celery. If you want do allow yourself a treat every now and again. Good Luck!|`|ZFUhiD4naa	EXercise and try eatting more veg.|`|ogzodLbMaa	try a cereal diet and whenever you get hungary try drinking water instead of eating a full course meal everytime.|`|AA11829623	Count calories, keep a food journal, and walk whenever/wherever you can.  I lost 10 pounds in a month by reducing my caloric intake to only 1,000 calories or less per day.  I ate stuff like egg whites (good source of protein), english muffins, and those string cheese sticks.  Also, I am addicted to soda, so I just drank either diet sodas or the C2 Cokes which are half the calories in a normal Coke.  I also bought a huge trampoline for exercise because it makes exercise fun!  The first week is the most difficult because you will feel starved, but after the first week your stomach will have shrank and you will feel fuller on less food.

KQeAx469aa	The best way to "teach" him how to bring you to orgasm is to take his hand and show him. Not only will you teach him what you really like, you'll also turn him on because guys love it when a woman is confidant enough to touch themselves. Keep in mind that the chances of him accidentally getting you off are slim. How is he supposed to know what will work if you don't tell/show him?|`|822fbb82f5d5939606c2c1e1c12d6a4caa	Try lying on top and don't let him move, then imagine you are on your own. After the first orgasm your body melts like butter and you can let him finish. It is much easier for me to relax once I have held him down. Then it's so much fun I go again while he is finishing. It won't last forever sex is something to perfect. A woman can have six different orgasms! Not kidding! I've only had like two of those, but I've got plenty of time to improve. Good luck!|`|6Ua4Coucaa	no it won't b 4evr.  find u a guy with a curve to his penis.  its wondrful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|328bd056701a608f8c906b15e7596a0aaa	First of all, that is very normal, so don't feel like you are different.  Second, whatever it is you do on your own, you should show your boyfriend, or at least explain to him, so that he will know how to do it to you.  He'll appreciate it.  If he's a good guy, he'll want to please you, and being able to make you happy will make him happy.  Does he know that he needs to give you a lot of attention before you actually have intercourse?  Make sure to tell him that, too.  If you are patient with each other, you can figure it out together.  Good luck!|`|0f920bd2ea497eb7f81a989c99587397aa	If  you're not getting wet to begin with, (short of a medical condition or post-manopausal stage), you might simply not be with the right guy for you.  Unfortunately, sexual chemistry isn't something you can choose to feel.  Even a guy who might otherwise be perfect for you, may not be your ideal bed partner.  If this is the case, you might simply have to move on.|`|0zY1NIHCaa	Try being on top of him, that way you can adjust yourself so you rub your clit against his body. You could also touch yourself if he is on top, or you are doing doggy style.    Sucks that you are not wet. What about forplay? Maybe he needs to touch you more to get you in the mood.|`|bhilsA1Zaa	Try self stimulation while you are having sex|`|rBFmC2eWaa	you are fine, that just means that your bf Sucks in S.E.X. and cant get you going.|`|f3f2cf783d2f2bb95e5bbc0c6822f012aa	let your boyfriend know what you do to get your self off  and let him try maybe more forplay|`|c63f5173d845317e75f8da8b92f30c64aa	I'm enjoying these answers! I have the very same problem so don't feel alone! I've heard over 50% of women don't orgasm during intercourse. Oral sex usually gets me to orgasm- although I don't get it often enough. Also the first woman's answer can work, but a vibe is even better! Good luck. If you love your partner as much as I do then you won't let the "bad" sex end your relationship, just work together to try to improve it.|`|H94VTSjaaa	Most young men and those beginning new relationships experience premature ejaculation . About 29 percent of men repeatedly experience P.E. Additional stress can be caused after this first encounter, because the man might be self-conscious and feel he needs to perform better.    Often young men experience "premature ejaculation during their first sexual encounters, but eventually learn ejaculatory control. Because there is great variability in both how long it takes men to ejaculate and how long both partners want sex to last.     There is often a temptation for men to attempt penetration as soon as they have a partial erection, just in case they lose it. The anxiety and movement involved is often enough to cause them to lose anyway, and they would have done better if they had waited until their feelings of sexual tension and arousal had increased, and they had developed a full erection. Even if they manage penetration, fears that they are going to lose their erection will likely result in just that happening. Alternatively, they may try thrusting rapidly or sexually fantasising, which may lead to premature ejaculation. It is important to take your time, as hurrying often results in disappointment.    Take time in cuddling and pleasuring each other before trying penetration. Whatever form of pleasuring is acceptable to you both is OK. Stroking the penis, or having it stroked by a partner, may help a man get a firm erection more effectively. Both men and women often enjoy being stroked and caressed. Start with light touch, just with the fingertips, along the back and sides, down the back of the legs and neck. Don't just rush to touch breasts or genitalia, although you may both want to do this later.     The man-on-top (missionary) position can be fun, but it's harder for most men to control their ejaculatory timing, because they have to hold themselves up. Try making love with the woman on top. This position is more relaxing for men, and it often helps ejaculatory control.     If still you are unable to control ejaculation time, then try to use herbal medications to treat premature ejaculation as herbal medications having no side effects and treat PE properly. One of the best herbal medication for premature ejaculation is Enlast. Enlast has been uniquely formulated with a variety of natural herbal remedies, vitamins, amino acids and flavoring to create an incredibly effective and powerful lubricant. One of the main ingredients in assisting with the sexual boost is L-Argynine; Arginine, an amino acid that has been demonstrated to aid in the increase of sexual stimulation.

Do you sleep with your hand under your pillow or any way that makes your arm put pressure on your heart? I dunno When i sleep on my left side my heart pumps extremely strong and i can feel it so i cannot lay on that side ever. When i do some times i will wake up and my arms will be asllep both of them i figured its cause im putting pressure on my heart and cutting off blood flow somewhere. best just to avoid laying on that side. :S|`|KQeAx469aa	Put more blankets on your bed or sleep in warmer pj's. I live in a very cold environment and when I don't have enough blankets on my bed whatever side was up is usually asleep. My doc told me that it was because I get so cold at night. You might also want to try sleeping on your back because the extra pressure of your baby might be just cutting off enough of your blood circulation that your right side could just be falling asleep.

Tambm  usada para registar a frequncia cardaca do feto ou os seus movimentos respiratrios, para detectar gravidezes mltiplas e para identificar vrias anomalias, como a posi??o incorrecta da placenta (placenta prvia) ou uma posi??o anormal do feto. A ecografia ajuda a orientar a direc??o da agulha quando se deseja obter uma amostra de lquido amnitico (amniocentese) para fazer estudos genticos ou de matura??o pulmonar e quando se tem de fazer uma transfus?o de sangue ao feto.    Para o final da gravidez, a ecografia permite identificar um parto antes de temo (prematuro) ou confirmar a rotura precoce de membranas que se d quando estas, que est?o cheias de lquido e com o feto no seu interior, se rompem antes do incio do parto. Por ltimo, a ecografia pode proporcionar informa??o til para decidir se  necessrio fazer uma cesariana.    Depois da primeira revis?o, uma mulher grvida dever fazer consultas de acompanhamento de 4 em 4 semanas at  32.a semana de gravidez, depois de 2 em 2 semanas at  36.a e, por ltimo, uma vez por semana at ao parto. Em cada consulta, s?o registados o peso e a tens?o arterial da mulher, bem como o tamanho e a forma do tero para confirmar se o crescimento e o desenvolvimento do feto s?o normais. Colhe-se uma pequena amostra de urina para determinar a presen?a de a?car e de protenas. A detec??o de a?car pode indicar diabetes e a de protenas pode indicar a existncia de uma pr-eclampsia (tens?o arterial elevada, protenas na urina e reten??o de lquidos durante a gravidez). Tambm s?o examinados os tornozelos para confirmar se incham.    Se a m?e possuir um Rh-negativo, verifica-se a presen?a de anticorpos anti-Rh; se a m?e for Rh-negativo e o pai Rh-positivo, o feto pode ter sangue Rh-positivo. (Ver sec??o 22, captulo 245) Se o sangue Rh-positivo do feto entrar na circula??o sangunea da m?e em qualquer momento da gravidez, ela pode produzir anticorpos anti-Rh que, ao passarem para o feto, podem destruir os seus glbulos vermelhos e provocar ictercia, les?o cerebral ou at a sua morte.    Uma mulher de constitui??o normal dever aumentar aproximadamente um total de 12 kg a 15 kg durante a gravidez (ou seja, entre 1 e 1,5 kg por ms). Aumentar mais de 15 kg a 17,5 kg provoca um aumento do tecido adiposo, tanto no feto como na m?e. Devido ao facto de no fim da gravidez ser mais difcil controlar o aumento de peso, a mulher dever evitar este aumento durante os primeiros meses. No entanto, se uma mulher aumentar muito pouco de peso, pode significar um mau pressgio, em especial se o total do peso adquirido for inferior a 5 kg, pois pode indicar que o feto n?o cresce com suficiente rapidez (uma situa??o que se denomina atraso do desenvolvimento fetal).    Por vezes, o aumento de peso deve-se a uma reten??o de lquidos por uma m circula??o sangunea nas pernas quando a mulher est de p. Em geral, este problema  aliviado deitando-se de lado (de preferncia para o lado esquerdo) durante 30 a 45 minutos, duas ou trs vezes ao dia.    Durante a gravidez, a maioria das mulheres dever adicionar 250 calorias  sua dieta diria, para nutrir o feto em desenvolvimento. Apesar de a maioria destas calorias dever provir de protenas, a dieta deve ser equilibrada e incluir frutas frescas, cereais e verduras. Para isso, os cereais ricos em fibras e sem a?car s?o excelentes. O sal, sobretudo iodado, pode ser utilizado moderadamente, mas devem ser evitados os alimentos excessivamente salgados ou que contenham conservantes. N?o  recomendvel seguir uma dieta para reduzir o peso durante a gravidez, inclusivamente para as mulheres obesas, pois reduz o fornecimento de nutrientes ao feto e  essencial aumentar um pouco de peso para que o desenvolvimento seja correcto. Apesar de, normalmente, o feto ter preferncia no momento de receber os nutrientes, a m?e dever assegurar-se de que estes s?o os adequados.  Ecografia: visualiza??o do feto    Na ecografia, coloca-se um transdutor (um dispositivo que produz ondas sonoras) sobre o abdmen da mulher. As ondas sonoras penetram no corpo, reflectem as estruturas internas e convertem-se em impulsos elctricos que, processados, d?o uma imagem num monitor      Geralmente, n?o se recomenda a administra??o de frmacos. (Ver sec??o 22, captulo 247) A mulher grvida n?o dever tomar nenhum frmaco, incluindo os que n?o precisam de receita (de venda livre), como o cido acetilsaliclico, sem primeiro consultar o seu mdico, em particular durante os primeiros trs meses. A necessidade de ferro aumenta muito durante a gravidez para satisfazer a necessidade do feto e da m?e. Normalmente, a maioria das mulheres precisa de tomar suplementos de ferro (em especial as que sofrem de anemia) porque, em geral, as mulheres n?o absorvem quantidade suficiente de ferro dos alimentos para satisfazer as necessidades da gravidez, mesmo quando este se some ao armazenado no organismo. Por vezes, os suplementos de ferro provocam um ligeiro mal-estar no est?mago e pris?o de ventre. Por outro lado, h que ter em conta que a necessidade de ferro aumenta ainda mais durante a segunda metade da gravidez. Se a dieta for adequada, talvez n?o seja necessrio contar com outros suplementos nem vitaminas, apesar de ser recomendvel a administra??o diria de uma vitamina que contenha ferro e cido flico.    As nuseas e os vmitos aliviam-se fazendo altera??es na dieta, tais como beber e comer pequenas quantidades com frequncia, comer antes de ter fome e ingerir alimentos suaves (por exemplo, caldo, consom, arroz e massa) em vez de pratos fortes e muito condimentados. Comer bolachas e beber uma bebida carbonatada tambm alivia as nuseas. Por isso, ter sempre bolachas junto  cama e comer uma ou duas antes de se lev

Assim, voc poder aproveitar mais tempo deitado em sua prancha remando atrs de boas ondas, do que deitado em uma cama de hospital.    Preparo fsico - Condicionamento  essencial para qualquer surfista. No caso de competidores, deve ser feito um trabalho de prepara??o fsica sob a orienta??o de um profissional de Educa??o Fsica especializado em surf.  necessrio realizar os treinamentos dirios, sempre com disposi??o e seriedade e respeitando os horrios.     Esta  a nica forma de se garantir uma boa condi??o fsica e melhorar a perfomance nas competi??es. J os "free surfers" que n?o queiram ou possam obter ajuda profissional, podem fazer exerccios fsicos como correr, nadar e pedalar, aumentando o ritmo gradativamente at chegar a pelo menos uma hora por dia de cada modalidade. Aquecimento e alongamento antes do surf e relaxamento aps aproveitar as ondas s?o importantes para aumentar a flexibilidade do corpo e garantir um resultado mais satisfatrio.     Alimenta??o - As refei??es precisam ser feitas em horrios certos, um hbito que ajuda a manter a sade, j que a prtica do surf estimula o apetite pelo alto consumo de calorias. Por isso, elas devem ser repostas da forma mais saudvel possvel e a alimenta??o precisa estar adequada ao clima local.     Aos competidores  recomendado o acompanhamento de um nutricionista, devido s viagens que causam varia??es na alimenta??o e no clima. Mas a regra geral vale para todos: equilibrar a ingest?o de protenas, vitaminas, carboidratos e sais minerais. Gorduras, sal e a?car branco devem ser evitados.     Descanso - O desgaste fsico, organico e psicolgico causado por um dia de surf  muito alto. No caso de uma competi??o esse desgaste aumenta ainda mais. Um rigoroso horrio de descanso de no mnimo 8 horas dirias para repor as energias  fundamental.  ideal tambm se acostumar a dormir e acordar cedo.     Preparo Psicolgico - O surf nunca deve ser empecilho para outras atividades do cotidiano, muito menos atrapalhar os estudos. A organiza??o  necessria para conciliar as atividades e garantir uma boa forma??o para o futuro, onde o surfista inteligente se sobressai por analisar as situa??es de maneira mais coesa.     Mesmo os competidores que pretendem seguir carreira profissional, devem se precaver, pois, um campe?o n?o se faz somente de preparo tcnico e fsico, educa??o  fundamental neste processo. A vida til de um atleta  curta e nem sempre  compensadora profissionalmente. Por isso seja realista e aproveite para tirar o mximo proveito do estudo.|`|aeNrovgyaa	Como o surfista fica na verdade a maior parte do tempo remando (pega uma onda de 15, 20 segundos e rema 5, 10 min. para vencer a arrebenta??o ou contorn-la pelas laterais e voltar), os bra?os e particularmente articula??es e msculos dos ombros s?o bastante exigidos. Nata??o com aquelas nadadeiras de m?o, para for?ar mais os bra?os do que as pernas, s?o um exerccio interessante. Uma alternativa seria ficar amarrado pela cintura em uma piscina, nadando parado, s com os bra?os e com a nadadeira, para for?ar mais. Se for fazer, utiliza aqueles elsticos de amarrar bagagem em carro, e fa?a um suporte para prender na cintura (eu utilizo o equipamento de kitesurf - harness, que prende na cintura, mas para quem n?o tem compensa fazer algum suporte simples).  A depender da estrutura fsica da pessoa, muscula??o pode n?o ajudar muito, pois o problema  a resistncia, para n?o cansar fcil, e n?o a for?a - N?o precisa ficar "malhado", basta ter uma estrutura fsica que n?o seja.. digamos.. quase raqutico, ou muito magro.  Voc nunca sabe quando ser exigido. Uma correnteza mais forte, uma sequencia de ondas inesperada, e a pessoa passa um perrengue se n?o "tiver bra?o". Tenho dois amigos que tiveram que operar os ombros por falta de condicionamento fsico.

6h3k7a5Maa	Quand j'ai appris ma sroposivit il y a 21 ans (infect 4 ans au-paravent), j'ai voulu en finir avec ma vie! Mais heureusement, j'avais rencontr le bouddhisme 1 an plus t?t. J'avais beaucoup de soutien et d'amour autour de moi, et je n'avais aucun sympt?me. En 2 semaines, j'ai pris le "taureau par les cornes" et dcida de VIVRE! Quelque chose en moi me disait qu'il y avait une raison pour ce drame. J'ai eu pleins de problmes jeune et avais du mal  voir l'interet de vivre. Mais quand j'ai pris cette maladie comme un "ami"...je commen?ais dj  aller mieux. ACCEPTATION: c'est la cl! La force en soi est la plus forte des forces. D'abbord, j'ai dis  toute ma famille et amis de ragir comme si je n'avais pas cette maladie, et que j'allai gurir! Pas de piti autour de moi. Je me suis construit une bulle virtuelle protectrice autour de moi afin de ne plus subir de stress ni de ngativit (visualisations).J'ai pris soin de manger bien, reposer, activit physique, et dvelopper ma foi. En 1986, on en parlait  peine... En 1987, le premier mdicament AZT tait  l'essai, dont j'ai particip presque un an. J'tais fatigu, nauses, maux de tte, problmes digestifs, anmie, etc. Donc on savait tous que je ne prenais pas le placebo. J'avais 28 ans et je bossais des fois 18 heures par jour, je suis photographe ( l'poque je vivais a Los Angeles). J'tais encore pleine d'nergie! mais ce n'tais pas toujours facile.... Petits bobos par-ci / par-l, un zona au crane (que j'ai radiqu en 6 jours avec ma pratique), paralysie faciale (tres vite guri et sans squelles), herps labiale souvent, dmangeaisons, mycoses (un peu partout)... Pas pour faire peur, mais pour dire que malgr les dsagrements qui arrivent, on peut toujours gurir. A Los Angeles, il y a beaucoup  n?tre disposition: Bons accuponcteurs, masseurs, magasins nutritionnels, toutes sortes de mdecines douces. Ici, c'est un peu plus dur... et les gens un peu plus "coinc" sur le sujet. L'accuponcture pendant 6 mois, chaque semaine, m'a enlev la plus part des petits problmes. Tout allait bien: longtemps. Mais quand je suis revenu en France en 1994, il existait le test de la quantitative du virus. On m'a dit de faire le traitement mais je ne voulais pas. Puis en Mai 1997 quand ma charge virale tait monte dans les millions avec 200 T4, j'ai un peu flipp et d? entamer la quadrithrapie. C'tait pas marrant les effets secondaires.... Mais j'ai tenu le coup, avec quelques changements de mdicaments pendant 1 an pour en arriver  un bon traitement que j'ai toujours. 10 ans de mdicaments: aucune charge virale et entre 500 et 750 T4. J'ai eu la chance de rencontrer l'homme de ma vie  37 ans (aprs des annes de croire que personne ne voudra de moi et pas d'enfant). On a eu Jordan pour nos 40 ans, il en a presque 8 maintenant, sain, en pleine forme (dur  suivre!!!), mon compagnon est srongatif aussi.   Je voulais partager mon exprience avec votre ami pour l'encourager. Je comprend trop bien cette souffrance qui peut nous envahir la vie. Le VIH ne sera jamais mon ma?tre... S'il veut me contacter, ?a sera avec plaisir. J'aime aider les gens, comme je le faisais beaucoup aux USA. En France, on m'a dit: "n'en parle pas!!!". Je devenais dpressive, ne pas pouvoir tre ce que je suis vraiment. Depuis un an, je l'ai dit  presque tout mon entourage et je me sens enfin libre, naturelle.

pBvexY6xaa	5 - 6 glasses sounds about right... and you ARE required to drink water before hand, no matter how advanced the technology is today.  My advice to you, though, is to not drink too much. Both times I've had pelvic ultrasounds, I drank way too much and it made the actual procedure really hurt because my bladder was so full.

I think you are trying to ask can you retreat your Hepatitis C with a second round of interferon and ribavirin.   Is that correct?    If so the answer is yes.   Usually if you fail one of the pegylated treatments you are then tried on the *other* pegylated treatment (by two different Pharmaceutical companies)    There is also a third nonpegylated interferon that can be tried as well but is only FDA approved for nonresponders.    Sorry to hear you were a nonresponder with your first try but I do know many people that have tried it again and been successful.   Sometimes the doctors will do little *tweaks* increasing or decreasing a dosage or adding a third medication or extending the time that you are on treatment - sometimes up to 72 weeks.    Good luck!  ~~~~~~~~~~  PS - for the benefit of the one person who posted incorrect information -  there is NOT a vaccine for Hepatitis C - only for Hepatitis A and B.

The problem is so many girls are desparate to model that they will risk their health to become as thin as these naturally small built females.    This is when eating disorders develop. It is a appeaulling that nothing is being done, since 2 or 3 models have died from eating disorder in the last year alone!

vrJJQVllaa	Yes, applying apple cider vinegar to a sunburn is a well known home remedy to sooth the sunburned skin.    If the sunburn is localized, apply full strength apple cider vinegar on the affected skin to obtain relief. Do this by soaking a thin towel in apple cider vinegar and placing it over the burn. Leave it on to help prevent peeling and itching.  If the sunburn covers a large part of the body then try this home remedy recommended by Patricia Bragg in her book called Apple Cider Vinegar-Miracle Health System:  Take a cool bath in which one cup of ACV has been added. After soaking in the bath, gently dry the body and pat ACV directly onto the needed areas. Wait 5 minutes, then pat on aloe vera gel.|`|AA11514493	NOOOOOOO! Vinegar is an acid! (acetic acid) it will only make the burn worse. Kind of like putting butter on a burn...that only seals the heat in. Use cool water to to ease the burn. Flush or immerse (try 10-15 mins in/ 10-15 mins out) until the 'pain' stops. Only then should you apply any lotions, and only then make sure the lotions are for healing such as real Aloe..(not Aloe Vera) or polysporin!|`|982279d1c02d4cd1cf6cc91caef5ab0daa	NO!!! wow, someone is really really cruel! That would hurt more then you can possibly imagine. Go buy a bottle of aloe vera, drink water and take advil. Stay away from the vinegar!|`|8HHBnRbIaa	yes it draws the heat out|`|0d946b7ca354a22a67c8ab31d557c40aaa	I have heard of that. I never tried it because I don't want to smell like a pickle. However, what I do is use Witch Hazel. You can get it at any Drug Store. I put it in the fridge and let it cool of. Then I put it on my sunburn and it feels so good! That is my highly recommend solution. Good luck =)

A lot of people recommend walking at a faster pace than you usually would. Either way, you should always take care to wear comfortable shoes and clothes, take a cell phone with you and water. Both walking and jogging, especially if you do it on slopes, will make your legs look "bigger" because it will develop your muscles.|`|hMowJ2v8aa	Yes, your legs will get bigger and more toned, but your cheeks will not get saggy - that's silly!

If you like to dance you can probably find a video that teaches you new moves. If you eat alot of sweets, you should probably cut back. Although you want to eat healthy, you dont always have to eat like a rabbit, but you dont want to eat alot of sugar either. Sugar stores in your body as fat and it goes straight to your stomach, butt, thighs and lower back. (love handles) Apples and Bananas are great for you but keep in mind that they have natural sugars. You will burn those faster than candy bars but if you eat too many of them you might as well have that candy. :) Its probably best that you start taking a multivitamin and exercise with some videos to get you started. Depending on your age you should probably consult a physician before starting a diet. They can tell you exactly how many calories you should consume and burn a day. Goodluck!!! :)

You should go to the doctor because if it is, you want to get your antibiotics asap so that it won't get worse.|`|x5Ym1C3Vaa	ur pregnant|`|5YPAr1BNaa	ya go 2 da doctor|`|edFyHFRhaa	Sounds like UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) or Cystitis... head to your chemist for a UI remedy and drink cranberry juice which helps. If it doesn't start to ease within 24 hours you should see your doc before it gets too uncomfortable.|`|rLsphyqhaa	As far as the color goes when your body has enough of vitamin C and any other vitamin that it gets from food it will eliminate them in your urine. Sound as if your bladder is not complete empty. I think they do have a med for it. This would be something you could take up with a Doc. Since you are recovering from anorexia they might be a little related so best check with them. Keep up the eating and all you might wish to add some other thing into what you eat. UTI and kidney also come to mind along with just the fact that you are a girl. Make sure you wipe from front to rear and wear cotton panties they help cut down on infections drink cranberry juice.|`|yyIVrngcaa	If it feels like you always have to be, your stomach is always hurting, and your urine is bright yellow...could be a UTI.|`|WrUTuQdlaa	A urinary stone, bladder tumor or ovarian tumor.|`|NGKwsawdaa	maybe a bladder infection, ask the doctor|`|ab682b6840784d29891281987e3e32b2aa	Does it hurt to pee at all or any discomfort? It could be the start of a Urinary Tract Infection or even possibly kidney stones (which could be the pain in your side). I would get it checked out by a Dr...either way they can help.|`|Lwf475l2aa	It sounds like it might be a urinary tract infection.  That happened to me a couple of months ago, out of nowhere!  I just went to the store and bought some cranberry juice, drank some, and after going to the restroom a few times that night, I was all okay!    You should try it.  If that doesn't work, then a doc doc would be the next step!  Hope it works :D|`|82033b5d4c73d8f7c4e1e7b8ca780429aa	idk.. the symptoms don't sound like anything i know of. try WebMD.com.|`|5SCMfucFaa	Bladder stones?  Bright urine would suggest that it is kidney related, especially if you are drinking a lot of water as very dilute urine is clearer, so this implies that your kidneys are possibly reabsorbing too much water into your blood.  See a doctor, I'm just guessing here|`|GrFGsrLGaa	It sounds like a urinary tract infection.  Cranberry juice (unsweetened!) or cranberry tablets work to fend off UTIs because it actually keeps the bacteria from adhering to the wall of the bladder.   So, you can try that.  However, if the infection has really taken hold -- if it starts to hurt to pee or if you develop pain toward your back -- you need to see your doctor for a definitive diagnosis and some antibiotics.  All they'll ask you to do is pee in a cup and they'll send it for urinalysis.|`|xOVFPmnzaa	my first response would be its a bladder infection|`|aMGfRum0aa	Probabably a urine or or kidney disease. The things you describes are the symptoms of the two diseases.|`|IDT1s0p6aa	Haha! No. She is not pregnant. First off hun, its your peroid. I always look that up. All that stuff. So dont worry about it.|`|SDzosiylaa	hey there...i had the same problem about a month ago.  everyone told me all kinds of things from kidney infections to bladder infections to kidney stones.  i tried a lot of at home over the counter remedies, but after 2 weeks i couldn't take it anymore and went to my doctor.  they took my blood pressure, body temp, and a urine sample.  turns out i did not have a UTI (which i had once about 3 years ago), but i had a "high-count of bacteria in my bladder."  They said this could be caused by several different things...even from public bathrooms.  Anyways, they gave me a 5 day prescription and i was totally fine after a week.  Hope you feel better!
SUlkDzn3aa	Shoulder muscle or deltoid.
cu2mJmvZaa	dentists work at the dentist.  and they do dentistry.  duhh.|`|kHBCUxwHaa	EAT SOULS|`|qxddYXMGaa	It funny because I went to the dentist today and got my first filling! :(    you learn things like x-rays and fillings and braces, well you get braces at the authodontist but you still learn that.
4BBjhHAnaa	You should talk to your gynecologist about this.    It sounds like your body is at least *trying* to menstruate, though it may just be some spotting.    Either way, considering that it has been 54 days, your hormones are out of whack.  This could be explained by stress or malnutrition, or it could be a serious problem.  Make an appointment to see your gynecologist!|`|bunAXlrXaa	not yet, but soon...unless you have very light periods  the same happens to me|`|q7HzVDxNaa	yeah unless you've been having sex, then you are pregnant.|`|6z3zsIf6aa	if your having sex, then you could be pregnant. if your not it is most likely your period. it will probably get heavier and change color in a day or two.|`|aIHSmRYwaa	possibly.
f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	She will lose some weight but eventually her body will settle in at the weight it feels most comfortable about.    In any event, walking and eating healthy will make her more fit and feel better.
h289rOUPaa	I think putting the lenses around it is recommended but I just put mine directly on the pupil.|`|WP36jh6Zaa	I HAVE DONE BOTH. BUT USUALLY DIRECTLY ON THE PUPIL. I USE TO PUT THE LENSE AROUND IT 1ST WHEN I WAS STILL NEW TO THE USE OF CONTACT LENSES.|`|TgUOMBIKaa	You put the contact on the pupil. It should cover the eye and extend over it unless you are wearing hard lenses.
UOZP4Ma5aa	It depends on your case, permanent retainers are prone to breakages
6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	I would get it done.  If your teeth don't come in perfectly straight, you can have big problems later on and it's harder to get them extracted when you're older.  The teeth become strongly bonded to the bone as you age.  They are also really hard to keep clean and hard to brush.|`|YBcB0732aa	Your wisdom teeth could be impacted. "impacted" tooth refers to a tooth that has failed to emerge fully into its expected position. This failure to erupt properly might occur because there is not enough room in the person's jaw to accommodate the tooth, or because the angulation of the tooth is improper. "    Look at the websites below for reason why wisdom teeth are removed.|`|YqCpJ3PIaa	He is probably recommending it because "most" people's mouths are not able to keep their wisdom teeth without crowding the others.  If you have no trouble keeping them clean and healthy and have room for them then it would be perfectly fine for you to keep them.  They usually recommend extraction over the summer to make it easier for you.  If you waited until you started to have pain or other problems it may be difficult for you to have adequate time to have them extracted and recover. You may be in college or working by then.|`|JPssvCAvaa	Unless they cause you discomfort they do not need to be pulled at all. It is a money making ploy like braces on perfectly straight teeth.|`|AA12071655	Well, first, let me smack you around a little, then I'll give you the serious answer.    Okay, you're 17 and you know it all. These guys who went to college for years? They dont' know nuttin, you got it all down and can't no one tell otherwise.    On to the serious answer....    If you leave your wisdom teeth in (and the nurse is somewhat right, it varies from one person to another) they will grow rather large and begin pushing against the mandibular joint (your jaw) making it harder and harder to work your jaw. They will also start crowding your other teeth, pushing them forward and destroying your teeth's alignment.    Wisdom teeth are a vestigial body part, like the appendix. Maybe at one time in our past our jaws were larger and could handle the extra teeth at the very back, but now they aren't and those extra teeth cause trouble.    Mine were taken out at 15; I'm 50 now and I don't know anyone over 30-ish who still has his. They're a problem, they're going to grow to be a bigger problem and you should have it done now while you have insurance to pay for it.
a0v3q3J4aa	I had that the entire time I was on Yaz (it's called "breakthrough bleeding") It's normal if you're on Yaz but it's not really normal for your body.  I had to get off that stuff and switch to Kariva    EDIT**** I got put on it to help control my acne and migraines it didn't do a thing for either. It didn't make it worse, but it didn't make it better.|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	yes yaz sucks and i went off of it last month and i had my period normal and now i am bleeding again like 4 days after i stopped lol this pill is a freakin joke, it also made me very irritated and angry and i just didnt want to do anything when i was on it i dont know but it was not a fun experience and also my dr says it causes ovarian cysts and i am going to the dr tomorrow again possibly b/c of cysts and all of these problems started after i started yaz it's awful and the 4 day period never happens!
3jNp3fzUaa	Probably early in the morning.  They are probably the busiest after school.  And also, at the gym, I think that a lot of people just mind their own business, so they probably won't just all be watching you.  Hope I helped!|`|kj507W26aa	Curves is a Women's Only gym.   I used to be like you , but just give it up.  You think that  people are starring at you but they really are not.  They are to busy trying to finish up so they can leave.  Just go and concentrate on your workout. Dont look at anyone. The fear will go away in 2 weeks.|`|780ByZVEaa	i have the same problem and i am not even in my teens anymore. but i brought the gym home by buying a jumprope, hoolahoop, ballskins exersize balls etc etc. I always think that during work hours and school hours are the best times but you should be in school then too.  Then there is dinnertime!|`|OY6R4ZP1aa	i fell the same way. But curves is not really going to help a 16 year old. it is not that intense. it is for more older people. but like 3 o clok on weekdays is good and early in the am.|`|AA11117029	You shouldn't be embarrassed to go to the gym, because everyone is focused on themselves and working out. When people go to the gym, they don't judge, because they might be shy about there bodies as well. The best time to go for me is after dinner, or at night time.     Hope this helped :)|`|pxfM7sGpaa	Why be embarrassed? People who go to the gym are usually there just to stay in shape or lose weight. All there for the same reasons. One thing I found out, since I am a shy person myself, what I do is take my IPOD and I listen to music while I work out.If someone is looking at you just say hello and continue with your workout, Breaks the ice, it helps. If the gym you go has television, look at that it keeps your mind from thinking that everyone is looking at you. There are less people in the middle of the day.
8RQCa3SXaa	sorry, but only about 80.    a fastter way to burn calories is actually running up and down the stairs.    every time you run up and then down the stairs you burn 8 calories.(equal to one minute of jogging) so doing this 10 times would burn 80 calories.    doing this 40 times a day would burn off 320 calorie. you would have to jog for 40 minutes just to do this.    i hope this is a help to you (:
Sgc6nhksaa	stiff neck, move it gradually.|`|VELnLnIKaa	stiff neck ....|`|h84uIkZOaa	stiff neck|`|7096c009cbfa017c4e16a7e737f601dcaa	I'd just go to school. The neck pain should diminish as you continue to move it.
YsX0Q5lnaa	They pull your jaw up to straighten your teeth. They exert force that moves your teeth, force that just braces on your teeth can't exert. They do hurt for the first few days - just take Tylenol for the pain and eventually you'll get so used to them it'll feel weird to not have them on.    You can also shoot them at people, that's always fun.    My embarrassing moment at the ortho? Not embarrassing for me but for the technician, and kind of sucky for me hah - I was getting my upper braces off and the wire slipped out of the tool she was using and bounced off my cheek into my eye! I was actually embarrassed, I don't know why, it wasn't my fault at all! Sneezing happens all the time, don't worry about it haha.|`|2rSm1OVbaa	o i had those to. they help pull your jaw back to straighten up your teeth. they wont hurt as bad when you get used to them tho
gCdP3NJGaa	I had one fitted after my son was born and never had any problems with it, been using them for 13 yrs now. My periods stayed just as regular but became slightly heavier- 6 days long but I have heard that they can be very long and heavy. A friend of mine had one fitted and had it taken out within 2 weeks as it didn't feel comfortable for her. I've never had any worry that it would fail and it hasn't (yet!) Best bet is to have a chat with your practise nurse|`|MojYmo5Jaa	I had a coil fitted and sometimes your body can reject it, and that is what happen to me, I was in severe pain, had stomach cramps, and had to have it removed.|`|P3kIkuyVaa	I know 3 girls who got pregnant with the coil so I wouldn't trust it. I am on microgynon and works for me. Good luck.|`|nG63KSMgaa	My ex had a coil fitted. She was only 17 at the time so you are not too young. She still got pregnant though so they are not entirely reliable.|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	In women who haven't had a baby it is sore being fitted, you may faint like my friend did, I think if you are having sex, stay on the pill it is the best protection ,it is safe if you are not having adverse health problems , in my experience .It is your body, and you can go on it at any age ,go to a Family planning clinic for their more specialised help.|`|lD8YCdciaa	I dont have any experience with the coil, but i am aware they can cause problems, even mental problems, and they dont have as higher protection rate agaist pregnacy as the pill, the implant and the injection. I'd advice you to find an alternative the coil is dated and their are lots more modern contreceptives avalible. There is a new contreceptive pill which is called Yazmin, however you have to ask your GP for it as it is expencive as will not give it to you with out you asking, there are little side affects compared to the normal microgynon pill, i.e. weigh gain and mood swings, and still has the same amount as protection as any other pill.|`|6KZA7D97aa	i was 25 when i had a coil fitted and i hadnt had any kids, and man i gotta say it did blood hurt like hell!! made me cry rite there on the table but i am not trying to put you off, if you can handle pain for about a minute then it mite suit you, however i had the coil removed after 6 months cos ijust didnt like the idea of having a foreign body in me, plus i got real bad period type pains frequently.     if you live in uk you could try the following pills which are said not to have that mood swing effect, they are 'yasmin' and 'cilest' i have heard good things about theses from friends etc. good luck.

I don't know why you would want to sleep until tomorrow but I would get enough rest before I exercised.|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	lol seems your like most people that say im going to workout and then always find some excuse not to and then say ill just do it tomorrow...how bout quit being lazy drink a cup of coffee or something...do your workout and then go to sleep..seems like the logical thing to me..because if you dont start sometime youll develop a routine of always finding the smallest excuses to not workout...and actually youll feel more energized when you start working out from day to day...instead of being tired all the time|`|hY0cb2xRaa	How about you just forget for a second that you are tired... And just start exercising.. I usually find that I am more energised after the end of the workout... UNTILL UNLESS IT IS DARK AND SLEEPING TIME.
K5IOSGXAaa	It depends on which one. If it is Zoloft, the drug just stops working in your system, so the benefits are lost. If it is Prozac, the drug is enhanced and you end up very drunk and unsteady, dizzy etc. You have to look at the particular drug's information paperwork and see what it says about using alcohol while taking it. And whatever you do don't smoke weed !!!|`|TujDGTUGaa	Just be careful, don't have too much.

YjlLfaL0aa	Hey,    Water helps move waste out of your body. And it helps your body function so yes water is VERY good to drink.  Try to get in 8 cups of water everyday!

You gain weight by retaining water and that is having a lot of salts in your diet.  So when you eat high amount of sodium in your diet, you need to drink more water to flush out those salts.  In the end, if you don't want to gain weight...... cut the salt out and you won't gain water weight.|`|JlEucUVtaa	It might give you cancer.|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Water is one of the few things it's almost impossible to overdo, unless you're really trying.

Don't over do it though, water has been known to not only flush out the waste, but the vitamins and minerals we need to survive as well.  Also if you are already dehydrated, water will only dehydrate you even more.  The suggested amount is 8 cups a day.    Good luck with the weight loss.|`|AA12182074	You gain water weight, sure, but that's not going to stay in your body.  You use the water.  You definitely should drink lots of water, ALWAYS!!!|`|4zoN1U3Waa	GOOD,Drinking lots of water is good all the time.|`|AA11884446	Water is very good for you as it flushes out your system.

Try not to let what you are drinking swish around in your mouth and make sure that you swallow while the liquid is going into your mouth.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	not unless none of the food you eat has any possibility of staining your braces as well!  otherwise its just a lot of hassle for yourself that will not result in any less staining at the end of the day.  Just try to brush your teeth regularly and use a rinsing agent and perhaps stay away from blueberry pies!|`|1ieUaMafaa	not sure about that but it's important not to drink water with too much fluoride in it!  that can also stain teeth around braces.|`|eIyFz2tQaa	Yes! They can help but may not eliminate staining. I always suggest your try to drink all your soft drinks, coffees, and teas through a straw regardless of braces :-)|`|1rrW2Hx4aa	yeah, think about it.  when you drink normally, the sugary drink that sticks to your teeth will cause decay if you don't brush excellently.  when you use a straw, the drink doesn't touch your teeth unless you swirl the drink around your mouth, which is gross.

I'm 5ft7 and I weigh 120lbs.  Hope this helped. =]|`|C2M2StR1aa	Your body burns a certain amount of calories each day whether you exercise or not. We each have what is called a Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR). This rate gradually decreases with age.  To the BMR you add the total calories used during the day due to all exercise and activity, which gives you your Active Metabolic Rate.     I am 6', 170 lbs and 52 years old. My basal metabolic rate is about 1700 calories burned per day. To that number I can add whatever calories I burn during the day due to activity and exercise. That will tell me approximately how many total calories I will burn up in a day.     Once you know this number you can eat however many calories you choose in order to lose, gain or maintain your weight.   You burn about 3500 more calories than you consume to lose a pound.     I have a page posted at my website that explains this further.  You can also input your own info to see your own numbers as far as calories used in a day.     www.diet-and-exercise-for-health.com/b...

dKi2R2oHaa	It would be a decision made by a consultant not a G.P. as to the recommended treatment.    I am not sure that spinal surgery would necessarily help anyway as the curvature is often caused by muscle or bone weakness, so would re-occur.    In cases of postural kyphosis in younger patients, correction may often  be possible without the additional risk and costs of surgery.        In some cases a patient may need to lose weight or show effort in changing their lifestyle to become a more appropriate candidate for such major surgery.     Paralysis would be a small concern. There may be risks associated with anaesthesia and infections to consider as well.      If the condition is recently diagnosed then the doctor will probably want to see how progressive it is and how it responds to other interventions, before considering surgery.     http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Kyphosis/Pa...|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	With any spine correcting surgery there is always the risk of paralysis. Surgery is only really advised if the patient is having symptoms such as back pain, muscle spasms and sometimes difficulty in breathing. Treatment also depends on the type of kyphosis, and whether the curve in the spine is causing any symptoms- if not then surgery isn't required.    The surgery for kyphosis is called a spinal fusion. Basically an opening is made in the back and the curve is corrected with metal rods/hooks on the spine. The recovery time after surgery can take quite awhile- physiotherapy is useful as well as regular exercise which will help strengthen the muscles in the back.
DtG4zpM2aa	I'm a little confused about the time scale of this.  Was the Monday you went to the doctors a week after you started bleeding or the same day?   If it was a week after you started bleeding when the pregnancy test was checked and was negative, it may well have been a miscarriage.   A prenancy test will only remain positive for a couple of days after the baby has died.       Not sure what else could be the cause, sorry.|`|uBkvqcY6aa	Sorry but the only sure way to tell is if you kept the tissue that came out.
KPtrfsEYaa	On the Jillian Michaels radio show she said that the treadmill is always better.  The impact you get from running is going to be more effective.  It will increase your cardio level and burn more calories because you have to work harder on the treadmill.  She thinks the elliptical is not intense enough.|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	I would say that the Elliptical will give you a stronger and more efficient workout than the Treadmill, since it works so many different leg muscles.|`|sG8pye1Taa	the elliptical burns the most calories. You use your arms an you are always walking up hill on the machine.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	the walk run is the best. you lose 10pounds pretty quick doing that. walk for 1 min, then jog for one. adjust it-more or less, depending on your fitness level|`|3890f326e072192e79ea3f718551dfb8aa	Walking/jogging is a better workout because all the work is your own. With an elliptical, the work out is easier because the motion of the machine causes you to exert less energy with each stride. However, an elliptical is much better for you body as it creates less stress on your feet, knees, hips, etc. When you run, each stride sends a jolt through your legs which can cause a number of different problems over the long run.|`|2amY3xZpaa	I personally feel the best work out is done naturally! I lost five pounds in a week just running for 1/2 an hour 4 times a week. I feel great and it's addictive too.|`|Hc82C7Lyaa	Use the elliptical, or a bike,    the treadmill is not good for you, bad for your knees, etc|`|NyZW8o1Kaa	Hah, Yeah!|`|qky1Q90xaa	Running is the best, then jogging. Interval training is also great. The elliptical is far better than nothing, but is not very strenuous.|`|l5OMFTMUaa	EITHER IS GOOD AS LONG AS YOU GET YOUR HEART RATE UP FOR AT LEAST 20 MINIUTES AT LEAST 3 TIMES A WEEK... TO START, THE ELIPTICAL IS BETTER ON YOUR KNEES THOUGH... IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT YOUR DOING AS LONG AS YOUR UP AND MOVING AND HAVE YOUR HEART RATE INCREASED :) GOOD LUCK!|`|hZFv8viAaa	i would imagine the elliptical. the elliptical would also help give you bubbly bum and work out your upper thighs, If you are unconcerned about this however, I suppose you could set the treadmill at a high setting. Though I don't reccomend overdoing it the first day, because you could acctually damage your muscles this way.

Control your Oxygen Rythms in your body first before kicking into high gear. Oxygen is the fire that burns fat. Walk and a few runs a week. Then after a while get into hardcore runs.
eyQBvbzraa	WALMART OFFERS HUGE SAVINGS|`|AA11538461	Walmart is pretty good too.|`|7XUzSepRaa	Your question is a little vague because you can't "buy" prescription medication, it has to be prescribed by an M.D. If you are talking about a prescription that is written by a doctor but is expensive and insurance doesn't cover all of it, such as the medication for chemotherapy nausea called Zofran, then there isn't much you can do. I think the best thing you can do is tell your doctor the problem you are having financially with the medication and ask him if there's anything he can do to make it more financially easy on you such as give you a generic brand. I hope your dilemma gets fixed!|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	Walmart sells generics for $4.00 each.|`|Zo8RhY9Iaa	If it is an antibiotic Publix is free.  Walmart has about 80 generic medications for $4.00.     When you say best cheapest I assume you are referring to best and cheapest?  Probably desiring either accuracy of filling or knowledge of pharmacists.  I would have to say Walmart pharmacists know less generally.  For that I would go anywhere but.    The general answer is your strategy I think, get them fillled different places for less money however, be sure to get printouts of your medications for you doctor and pharmacist to check beforehand.    !0 points plz.

AA10184408	As  a football coach I can tell you that a month is not enough time unless you are lean, 5% body fat or less. If that is you then you will need to do 1000 sit-ups a day in different positions like inclines, knees bent and hanging from a bar. Good luck Steve!|`|GvYKQ0Goaa	no such thing.    sometimes getting a nice body  and all that can take years.    eat right.  drink & eat a lot of protein  and maybe get a personal trainer  they'll know exactly how to guide you & everything.      :)|`|O8b92k4Qaa	You already have them.... you need to have a  body fat % of around 9-11%... diet, exercise.. you need to GROW your abs and reduce your body fat % .. this will do it for you..|`|O4aQYTj6aa	everyone has it with the diet thing but a little exorcise, or a lot, helps too. crunches do a world of good for them. although your back and neck dont like them. but anyways crunches work your upper abbs. for lower abbs you do basically the same thing but with your legs. i do 100 every other day. two sets of 50.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	No way jose.

I prefer theraflu it works on me like a charm.  also whenever you sleep make sure to war lots of clothes so that you get overheated this will help trust me...thats just some advice.|`|dMV0uip2aa	Benedryl tends to make people tired, so maybe before you go to bed take one? Milkshakes or popsicles soothe the throat, and try to keep the talking to a minimum. Take showers daily, eat all your meals, and get some sleep. Probably everything you've heard, but trust it. :)|`|5ypdHLtGaa	whenever i feel like i'm coming down with a cold, i get one of those juices.. i think it's Odwalla or something, usually near the OJ in the grocery store or by the produce,  but they make a C-monster one that is like a 2000% serving of vitamin C and i swear it makes it go away. You've already got the cold, but the vitamin C will still help.     or whiskey.     choose your poison.|`|tSi10jneaa	I am sure you do not have a very good bowel movement, clear that constipation you have currently and drink lukewarm water only. In morning you can drink lukewarm water with one lemon squeezed in it on an empty stomach.  Also avoid heavy food and dairy. They will cause more cold problems.  You can also try garlic chicken soup.
KNGs5JfAaa	i actually had the same problem & i freaked out! i went to my doctors & got checked , it was normal thought it usually happens right before or after ur period, so i was relieved!! but if it has to do with ur health u shouldnt be embarrased, it if happens often u should go see ur doctor  =) i know doctors can be scary !!|`|F1OIpk4daa	If you're due on it can become thicker sometimes. Other factors it could be, Thrush or another type of infection.  B.V. usually has a fishy, thin type discharge. To be honest, if it's the first day of having discharge like this, give it a couple of days... If you get itching/further discharge etc go see a Dr. Other than that it seems to be relatively normal?
8n7EuqGtaa	Maybe buying a new outfit or sexy lingerie.  Dancing in the mirror wearing sexy clothes is always fun for me and lifts my mood and body confidence.

But seriously just take it as a compliment and be thankful for how you look =] people obviously like it so so should you|`|yXu83vLmaa	Are you sure your not a smaller size? honestly I know you hate to hear it but maybe exercise is the only other way. Its always helped me!|`|4B7vXaVZaa	stop comparing yourself to other people. sorry hun, but there are girls out there who will be either smaller than a 11 or a 5 or bigger than the two, and still look better than you...so drop that whole idea. and secondly, try focusing on your good qualities...all of them! not just the fact that you're healthy. is that all you have to you? find out more about yourself to love. |`|Hzospze7aa	Ok, this advice is going to sound way awkward, but do it. Seriously.     Get your clothes off, or put on a bathing suit, and stand in front of your mirror. Think about what makes you a beautiful woman. Don't think about what others think of your butt or boobs, or this or that, think about how YOU like them. Notice how you look nice from different angles. Think about your cutest outfit and why it looks good on you. Think about the awesome things about your figure. You have great hips, or something like that. Or your butt looks awesome with your cutest undies on.     Do this ritual regularly, and STOP yourself if you start to think, "oh, I'd make my butt less big" or "my legs are too this or that.." only allow yourself to think about the good things that you like. Don't compare yourself to other girls who have different figures than you. Women are like snowflakes. Each of us is different, and that's what makes us awesome.|`|6FKnLcnnaa	Take a step back look at the system once you see how it works then you can opt out.  1. The media shows us our ideals, what we wish to become (super models, weightlifters etc.)  2. The media then shows how we can achieve these ideals often falsely.  3. People buy the product and they find that often it does not work.  4. The reason these ideals these prefect people are held in such high regard is because their position is difficult to obtain.  5. People are drawn even more to the TV people because at least at a subconscious level the realize how hard they had to work to achieve this level of perfection.    The answer to you question is this simply analyze the system accept that it is there and just relax realizing that you can let it not apply to you.|`|WpaQKpckaa	I feel the same way  except that I'm 5'7.. 15 years old and 140 lbs  i wear a size 10/11 & jeans and my friend was going thru my jeans the other day and couldn't believe that they were mine..she said they were so big  the thing is that you have to accept yourself the way god made you. tell yourself you are beautiful everyday and tell yourself all the attractive things about your body.. everyone struggles with confidence you just have to know how to control it|`|pryLMC8Saa	watch "How To Look Good Naked"  I know it sounds really lame, but my god.

You could always thing: well hey atleast i'm not fat lol and u arn't so ur good =P maybe u just need someone different to tell u how good you look. Sometimes when ppl tell you that you look good and it's the same ppl who are saying it you get used to them sayin it and sometimes think it's no big deal w/e and just go on with ur day. But, ur finance likes ur body so be happy girl.

rpnFxnCQaa	Good it is the early stage!  You may try the revitol stretch mark prevention cream. As the name indicates, it prevents marks but it actually also reduce existing ones. One thing is sure: the earlier you tackle the problem, the better. I must tell you that stretch marks are very hard to completely get rid of. But they can be diminished (and, obviouly, prevented).  It worked for me. If you are not satisfied, just ask your money back.     Good luck!|`|7Bjvmfyiaa	I have heard that cocoa butter lotion works...never used on me, but give it a try!

I couldn't ever loose that much..   well, whatever you feel happy with yourself,  I read a survey the other week though that says that most men like women around size 12 if that is what you are loosing it for :)
yHI6rfeUaa	A weight loss of 15-20 lb / week is extremely fast and probably not achievable even for the first week.    If you are extremely overweight (twice or more of your ideal weight), and you go into a solid excercise and diet program you may see weight losses initially at 10 lb / week.  Within a few weeks this rate will not be sustainable.  Expecting to see 15 - 20 lb loss in the best week of weight loss is not realistic.    Of course you can do extreme and foolish things - and who knows what such extreme and foolish things will do for the short and long term but usually they do not result in long term weight maintenance or long term good health.|`|lz302Y1Xaa	No, and even if it was that would be very risky to your health. It's supposed to be healthiest to lose no more than 2 pounds a week.|`|CROOYi9Faa	It is probably possible to lose 15-20 pounds a week if you eat right and exercise at a gym everyday. It is highly unlikely but still  possible but is is extremely unhealthy for someone to lose that amount of weight in a week. You should eat healthy and go to the gym 3-4 times a week and don't try to hard. You should drink about 8 full glasses of water daily and try to stay away from carbs. You should eat lots of vegetables and fruits and don't under eat because it wont help you. If you follow these instructions you will lose weight in a healthy way. Hope that helps answer your question.|`|4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	No, especially if you're trying to do this the healthy way. Do you realize that would mean creating a 52,500-70,000 calorie deficit a week?
OLTjkS4zaa	Set realistic goals.    I like to look at my before picture.    Buy yourself an article of clothing that is one size smaller to look forward to.    Do it for yourself.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	Give yourself small rewards as you progress.|`|clSvfDmVaa	Have a pair of jeans/dress/bathing suit you want to fit into (I had a pair of jeans that were a size smaller than what I was), preparing the night before (laying out clothes, backing workout bag) and going first thing in the morning (before your brain realizes what you are doing, lol), and wanting to be healthy.  Something needs to click for most people to start losing weight.  Once you start exercising the way you feel can motivate you too.  I know my body has started craving exercise and feeling crappy when it doesn't get it.|`|e0UHbyRBaa	Measure yourself when you start your diet.  When you start to see yourself losing inches, even in the weeks where you might not lose much weight that will motivate you.  Try to do it with a friend so that you can encourage each other.  Take lots of exercise, the endorphins you get whilst exercising will make you feel great and you will feel more motivated to keep going :)|`|BMpj22wqaa	i have recently lost 5 stones in weight and i find when i am due to go of the rails so to speak, i look at the old pictures of me before i lost the weight and that generally helps me to get back on to my diet. also i find it really great when friends and family tell me how good i look.|`|lmS8NHN4aa	actually, i dont know.

qMwjrQbOaa	Join a gym.  Get a balanced diet and exercise regularly|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesnt really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesnt need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but dont worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.  Good luck and God bless.

Also, it could interfere with other contraception such as the pill or it could mean you couldn't take it again this month if you had a real emergency - you can only take it once every cycle.

If he's your friend I would find out. If he doesn't then you have no worries.|`|Ms72jNbBaa	There is a small amount of semen that is emitted prior to the actual climax.  In normal intercourse, a woman could become pregnant from that small amount of semen - and thousands have - even though the man withdraws prior to climax.    Withdrawal prior to climax will not guarantee that an std might be contracted through oral sex.  HIV is present in the body fluids, and HSV in present on the skin during outbreaks, regardless of the exposure during climax.    Always practice safe sex.  The best setting is in an exclusive monogamous relationship.  Sex is a gift from God and not a toy.

AF8meDXOaa	JV`s advice is wrong.I am taking a nutrition class and carbohydrates are very important for you. Eat bread.Try to make half of your grain products whole (like whole wheat) If you eat protein only and neglect carbohydrates like bread, rice, pasta, potato, sugars, than your body will try to use protein for energy by turning aminoacids to glucose (becasue brain, nerve cells and red blood cells only run on glucose) which will have) which has some bad effects. Your diet should consist of  45-65% carbohydrate, 10-35% protein and 20-35% fat.    Having said that; do you have access to ethnic stores like middle eastern ? I will suggest you sth. called helva or halawa. It is a sweet thing (not a spread like nutella but comparable) made of crushed sesame seeds and pistachios. You can put it in a bread and add some butter, eat it for breakfast Anther option is to get a sandwich with cheese, tomatoes, eggs, even olives (not the american style olives-you can find the ones i am talking abut in the ethnic stores), with a cup of milk, or orange juice or tea. I have some more ethnic breakfast ideas too for you like made of chickpea spread but you need to eat a few times and get accustomed to taste in order to like it.this is why i am not writing them here, unless you request.    For lunch and dinner, learn to make food from scratch. A simple way to make a dish out of a vegetable that applies to many vegetable with slight variations (like cauliflower, green beans,, okra etc is to pan fry an onion (sometimes also garlic too)and minced meat, add tomato paste  and continue pan frying a bit more, than add the veggies and some water and let it cook. (variations: example: for okra, you also add green pepper and some lemon juice)All of these could be eaten next to rice. (Simple rice recipe: put  an amount of rice in a preferably shallow pan that has a lid. Add water (1 and a half the amount of rice ) Add butter and salt.(turn the heat high, once it starts boiling, turn  down to medium heat and let it cook for 15 mins or so? until all water evaporates. Leave the id close never open it while cooking.At the end leave it on for another 10 mninutes or so , than open it , stir once and eat. (you can add things like cooked chickpeas or cooked peas to it.)   Also a recipe for you to cook excellent beans:  Soak bans overnight, cook next day (use  presure cooker for cooking things fast.Beans can be ready in 10-15 minutes., you can boil a whole chicken in pressure cooker in half and hour etc.. makes it much more faster) Cook chunks of meat with bones (veal, lamb whataver)Follow this recipe: panfry onions, add garlic and tomato paste and red pepper paste,continue panfrying, add the cooked bony meat and beans, add chopped green pepper and carrots if you wish and salt. Close the lid of the pot or pressure cooker.(in pressue cooker it should be ready in 10-15 minutes.On the side, make rice and salad. (here is a bonus salad recipe for you.  (chop some red cabbage and grate some carrots.Chop a tomato and if you wish  ,grate a turnip/radish squeeze out its bitter water.(you can also add a little choped onions to this salad)Combine these in a plate (you can choose to decorate or just mix them, up to you. Put. lemon, salt and oliveoil and very little vinegar(optional)make sure you put right amounts of each (salt, lemon,oil) Voila!!|`|jKF58jmTaa	Stick to eating alot of red meat, fruits and vegetables. No bread, no mashed potatoes, no fries, etc .. good luck. oh and alot of fluids, for example water and gatorades that will keep you hydrated.|`|CROOYi9Faa	I would say for break feast you should eat an omelet and drink a glass of orange juice.

She is not  a film star- bigger than that !  She now has grandchildren  .  The doctors will probably do IVF to ensure you have the implantation in the right place next time.    You were actually lucky that the pregnancy had not gone further and destroyed the tube.  You should be alright for a future pregnancy.
yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|NPzDQmlQaa	One thing that brought my dieting and losing weight out of the plateau I was in so long was the Acai Berry.  I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.    Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|00A9ZPCaaa	Theres really a lot out there.

Are yo on any current medications that cause you to retain water?  Are you consuming a lot of salt?  Water weight can cause you to gain as much as 20lbs, or even more at times.      If you are not exercising enough, your metabolism could be flat-lined. If that is so, you could be eating less or the same amount, but because of lack of exercise actually gain weight.  If you are on a ridiculous diet that your quit and then try another diet,  and then another, your body is confused and is hording fat.  Your body may be thinking you are starving it, so it holds onto fat.  This is basic survival as far as your body is concerned.    I find that when you don't know what you are doing wrong, you are doing everything wrong.  I would most definitely make an appointment with your General Practitioner and have him/her examine you and if things are as they should be, have your doctor place you on a diet that is reasonable.  If they do not offer you a diet, then let your fingers do the walking and contact a Nutritionist. Join a gym too if you can afford it.  To lose weight, you have to burn more calories then you take in.  It is that simple as that assuming you are healthy and there are no underlying health issues.  Good Luck!

iNBLWIFKaa	It only helps to dehydrate you. Therefore, losing "water weight". But it can be dangerous and I do not recommend doing this. It just makes you sweat and if you are wrapped up while you are doing vigorous exercise you could possibly pass out or become too dehydrated.    I have heard of wrestlers doing this to cut weight before a match and women doing this to relief bloating.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	that is a myth|`|Bs8sllD9aa	I seen a special on some thing like that. In hollywood some for the really high end places do something like that. Some of the clients they showed were pretty big named people.|`|wqchA8B7aa	It makes your body heat up, and you lose more water. It's bad for you, don't do it. Plus it looks dumb when you're changing.|`|AA12050428	Are you intending to go on sale in the shop window.|`|UbXp2K26aa	It makes your body sweat more, you lose more water, does not help in weight loss whatsoever though. And you can become dehydrated. Some people are hospitalized because they take it too far.|`|bYv4EtbUaa	no, this is dangerous and is stupid, the logic behind it is that you will sweat more, losing more calories, but at the same time losing precious salts (also called antioxidants) that form shields around your cells and prevent disease. Although common myth is that you can replace antioxidants through drinks (such as powerade or gatorade) the truth is that if you sweat too much, replacing all of them cannot be achieved simply by drinking those drinks. There are plenty of other ways to lose weight!|`|ytMpRueeaa	wow that sound retarded. clinging wrap... um lets see try you buttocks haha|`|SuMwWNfyaa	it doesnt help at all.    you wrap it around your belly,but there isnt any proof it works.|`|SBjV8GlFaa	Don't believe all you hear!

But you will regain it when you start drinking liquids.  Its a short cut and a temporary fix.  Eliminating salt is better.|`|mz3EuHktaa	I used it when I wrestled in high school but it was only to drop 2-3 lbs of water weight before weigh ins.  It is not a safe thing to do to lose a lot of weight|`|kT4I3C6caa	Help with nothing and you should not wrap anything!  It's harmful to wrap clinging wrap on your body.  Please do the right thing!  Good Luck!|`|qaUaGjz0aa	if you put a trashbag over your chest and work out or run it makes you sweat more and you lose weight quicker. maybe thats what your refering too|`|U23j6TGGaa	Helps you sweat more.....I wouldnt do it you'd look like a tard and you sweat plenty at the gym anyways.......they make sauna suits too that do the same thing.....I saw a guy wearing one and he looked like he was taking off for mars with buzz light year

You need a pretty strong background in organic chemistry for obvious reasons.  And first you've got to acquire a fairly sizable bit ergotamine tartrate, which comes from the ergot fungus that grows on grains.  It is poisonous in it's original form.  Trust me, you WILL get caught if you go trying to acquire these ingredients.  Unless you have a chemist friend in a country with lenient drug laws you're much better off just buying it than going to prison for decades or worst yet completely frying your brain because you don't know what the hell you're doing...    If you truly must try to make your own then I would suggest growing (or picking if you live in the south) some psychedelic mushrooms.  It's still illegal, but FAR easier (you need rice, a pressure cooker, and some spores).    Cheers!!|`|s0T9p9Araa	What type of acid are you talking about.

xRvetiAMaa	The wrap is to restrict use of the area; that's what's called 'immobilizing'. Fingers should not look discolored from wrapping or casting. Don't 'clamp' the wrist by over-tight wrapping.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Yes. Why do you need to wrap it? Do you know what's wrong with it?  If you don't know how, go to a pharmacy or similar place and ask them to show you how to do wrap it properly.|`|46827e1fada67be5dddf23d61ecc3c2eaa	If it's too tight it's not allowing blood to flow bringing oxygen & nutrition to the tissue & the tissue dies.|`|AA11021102	You have to address the underlying cause and extent of the injury, otherwise this and similar questions are superfluous.  What happened to the wrist, how long ago, what has been done to diagnose and treat it so far?
46827e1fada67be5dddf23d61ecc3c2eaa	The reason you ice is to help swelling & to constrict the vessels so when it warms back up it forces fresh blood through the vessels which brings nutrients oxygen & healing to the area & washes out toxins. If the vessels are constricted for too long, the tissue dies without the nutrition and oxygen from the blood. Smaller areas need only 10-15 min. Larger areas like thighs & your back can take 20-25 minutes. You should always allow the area to return to normal body temp before putting the ice back on it.|`|72cef19a31314b3ec0ec5517673d7929aa	Tissue damage.|`|xRvetiAMaa	Not true. It's just that highest effect with icing is over after 20 minutes. Better to repeat it 2-3 times a day at 20mins each.    After the first day you can safely switch to alternating hot/cold soaks or packs (called Contrast Baths: 3 mins hot, 2mins cold & repeat 3 times ending with hot) or to hot packs, 20 mins. Gentle massage will help, too.

N1wRl9W3aa	Ol    Em algumas pessoas, o orifcio resultante da extra??o do dente demora mesmo a fechar, podendo levar at dois anos. Isso devido a um atraso na remodela??o ssea, prpria da fisiologia da pessoa. N?o se preocupe: ele fechar, s vai demorar um pouco mais. Para manter limpo o local o ideal  realizar bochechos vigorosos e, dependendo do caso, costumo indicar uma escova chamada unitufo, que tem uma cabe?a c?nica e angulada prpria para a limpeza de locais de difcil acesso. Se vc n?o encontr-la, um cotonete dobrado ao meio est de bom tamanho para remover os resduos que acumulam na rea (dobrado ao meio para ter uma angula??o passvel de ser utilizado). Estes procedimentos n?o causam qualquer problema.    Em rela??o ao Arty Glass X Resina Acrlica, o que posso te dizer  o seguinte: o Arty Glass  um cer?mero, que  uma material intermedirio entre a resina e a porcelana.

Bom, de fato seu organismo est com uma anomalia bastante incomum, pois o normal  que nossa gengiva procure fechar quaisquer orifcios que surjam em nossas arcadas dentrias em tempo bastante curto. De qualquer sorte, vc precisa procurar um cirurgi?o dentista bom, e talvez tenha at que fazer implante de retalho gengival para corrigir a falha.|`|uC8KaTwmaa	Faz um ano que t com o buraco aberto e n?o procurou outro dentista para tratar? Que falta de considera??o com sua amiga boca, hien? hehe... Brincadeira...    Eu concordo com a resposta anterior. N?o fecha mais, pois a mucosa deve ter cicatrizado aberta. Sen?o haveriam sangramentos ou incha?o e dor devido a possveis inflama??es. Talvez se cortar o "excesso" de pele do buraco e der um ponto cicatrize certinho, fechadinho.

The day you start make sure you eat something, drink some tea and take a Motrin. I know its hard to actually want to eat but try.   I've had to leave work and school becasuse of the pain and many time I get nausea  and end up throwing up. It does help but never force yourself to throw up. It is bad and unfortunate but every women is different.  Go to the dr and have them prescribe some medicane.

Some types of BC cna help minimize the cramps.     ***If these symptoms do not go away, I suggest seeing a GYN, you could have cyst on your ovaries.***|`|FSOun3C3aa	Ibuprofen and apply a heating pad to the abdomen.

Agora suspenda a cabe?a e caminhe com sua cabe?a na dire??o da borda oposta, (n?o mova a sua m?o do lugar) de modo que "o queixo fique dentro do cilindro", quase que tocando na gua.

I don't think you are over weight in an unhealthy way but loosing like 3 or 4 pounds couldn't be bad for you. I hope i don't sound mean cuz i'm not trying to be or anything.   Have you ever heard of spinning classes? Just incase you haven't they are these classes were you do intence work out of a bike that stays in one place. where i am the spinning classes only last about 30-45 minutes but it is great for you legs.  Running and walking is always good but i know how boring that can be to some people, so if you live in a place with some wilderness you could go on a hike and look around at all the animals and stuff cuz that way you are working out and having fun at the same time.  If you can't hike or anything you could always walk around and mall and go into stores and look around and stuff, but you have to make sure you visit alot of stores so that way you walk around alot but make sure to stay away from those bad restrants in the mall.  There are lost of other things. Just do anything that works you legs or anything else in your body but make sure you think it is fun because if you hate what you are doing to work out the you might not last.  good luck! I hope you do well and have fun!

1JCtMcu6aa	oi Mary espero que isso te ajude     AS contra as espinhas  passo a passo  Ingredientes  - um vidro de Leite de colonia de 100ml  - + 5 comprimidos de melhoral adulto (AS: cido acetilsaliclico 500 mg)    Preparo e uso  Jogue os comprimidos na solu??o.  Deixe descansar uma noite.  Agite sempre antes de usar.  Limpe a pele com um algod?o  noite.  Deixe de 15 a 20 minutos e lave em seguida com o sab?o de sua preferncia. Se desejar limpar a pele pela manh?, repita o processo e lave em seguida.    obs.: pela manh? n?o deixe o produto sobre a pele, lave com gua e sab?o e (use filtro solar sempre), beba bastante gua diariamente (ajuda a purificar o organismo, eliminar as toxinas e a deixar a pele bonita e hidratada).  - um timo tonificante aps lavar o produto com gua e sab?o  borrifar soro fisiolgico sobre a pele e deixar secar naturalmente hidrata, alimenta e acalma a pele.    ----  O cido acetil saliclico est presente na composi??o de muitos retinicos e n?o conhe?o nada mais eficiente no tratamento de cne, calos e outros procedimentos onde a escama??o  indicada. Age como um depurador facial e n?o agride a pele. Mas antes de usar verifique se voc n?o tem alergia ao cido acetilsaliclico. Voc pode usar outro produto depois de lavar a pele com seu sabonete de preferncia. A solu??o de AS com leite de col?nia nada mais  que um adistringente, de limpeza com a??o cicatrizante e retinoica, remove cravos e espinhas e ameniza marcas de cicatriz. Se vc tem tendncia a desenvolver queloides, este  um timo preventivo para que a cicatriza??o seja perfeita.  Algumas pessoas usam na limpeza e tratamento de cortes e outros ferimentos (apenas em use em pequenos ferimentos, arranh?es e cortezinhos ou ferimentos maiores j suturados), neste caso  limpar e deixar.  Quando for espremer uma espinha (o que n?o  nem um pouco recomendado) envolva os dedos e algod?o embebido da solu??o e limpe em seguida, ai vc vai ver o que eu estou falando, no dia seginte mesmo se ferir um pouqinho o ferimento seca depois de alguns dias 2 ou 3, sai fica casquinha, seca, seca e a pele embaixo depois fica novinha em folha.|`|b3c25ed7e8ef3f3c8e54d316c9228eb2aa	Voc precisa consultar um mdico, dermatologista.|`|c60cb72869669cb3322a74fd1f2b42b8aa	evitar nao tem jeito mas procure manter a pele empre limpa e mensalmente fazer limpeza de pele|`|0G6EnRh9aa	vc nao falou de sua idade nao tem como eu te responder!?|`|24KkvZbuaa	Voc n?o mencionou sua idade, mas na maioria dos casos, espinhas s?o inevitveis.  Elas vem e v?o com o tempo, o nico problema  que podem deixar marcas.  Dependendo do caso, se a concentra??o de espinhas for grande, o ideal  ir a um dermatologista para seguir um tratamento.  Para amenizar a situa??o, ingira alimentos com menos gordura e use sempre um filtro solar.|`|5tFPmZBBaa	Evite espreme-las sem a ajuda de um profissional, pois casso contrario voc poder pegar uma infec??o na pele.   O mais correto a ser feito  procurar um profissional especializado na rea (um dermatologista), pois ele poder le indicar um remdio que realmente fa?a efeito na sua pele (pois existe vrios tipos de peles). E fique tranqila pois se voc procurar o profissional certo voc logo eliminar todas a suas espinhas. Pois existem inmeros medicamentos para essa situa??o.

Beba muita agua durante todo o dia, e mantenha a pele sempre limpa lavando umas 3 vezes ao dia com sabonete adequado. Se a pele estiver muito inflamada, procure um dermatologista, para um tratamento adequado.|`|ez2UzJoLaa	A espinha  uma inflama??o dos poros e pode aparecer devido a uma pele muito oleosa e/ou por problema hormonal.     Se sua pele for oleosa, acostume-se a lavar o rosto com sabonete anti-sptico (de preferncia lquido) vrias vezes ao dia. O Soapex  uma tima op??o. Usar um esfoliante facial duas vezes por semana tambm ajuda a limpar os poros e portanto a evitar as  infecc??es (espinhas). Os da Neutrogena s?o timos. Mas o melhor mesmo  usar algum produto especial para o tratamento da acne. O perxido de benzola  excelente e quase n?o h contra-indica??o, voc encontra em qualquer farmcia. A marca Solugel  uma das melhores. Passe uma fina camada na pele antes de dormir e em alguns dias voc j nota uma melhora na pele. Agora se a espinha j apareceu, use um gel secativo antibitico chamado Clindacne,  muito bom, vc encontra tambm em qualquer farmcia e sem contra-indica??o.    Se com todo esses cuidados ainda sim voc continuar com muitas espinhas, procure um dermatologista. Ele poder indicar algum remdio oral mais forte e que deve ter acompanhamento mdico.     Porm se o problema n?o  a sua pele oleosa, procure o seu ginecologista pois pode ser um problema hormonal - o que  bem comum se vc for adolescente. Ele provavelmente indicar o melhor anti-concepcional para regular seus horm?nios e aliviar sua pele.     De qualquer forma n?o passe qualquer produto no rosto, fique atenta sempre  formula??o. Use sempre produtos oil-free e sem lcool. Procure sempre produtos especiais para pele oleosa, inclusive maquiagem, demaquilante, hidratante e filtro solar. Nunca durma sem antes lavar bem o rosto, pois  durante a noite que a pele mais produz mais leo e entope os poros, causando a  inflama??o. Os poros devem estar sempre limpos.    Eu n?o aconselho a Minancora pois  uma frmula muito oleosa e s faz piorar a situa??o. Tambm n?o v atrs de frmulas caseiras, sempre s?o suspeitas e podem causar srias alergias. J existe no mercado produtos timos, de laboratrios srios, especficos para este problema. S?o muito mais indicados, como o perxido de benzola que citei.     Alm disso uma alimenta??o livre de gorduras e ingest?o de bastante gua durante o dia tambm ajuda.|`|yOsyUJzjaa	antes de dormir, lave o rosto com querosene|`|IbyUhNNvaa	ola..  nao deve comer muitas porcarias, esprema-las, desinfecte-as....e se nao resultar aconselho-a a ir a um especialista de pele...|`|zKuc0Dlcaa	lave o rosto sempre, v a um nutrologo, pois a alimenta??o tb influencia e  s.|`|yYcwkYHQaa	nao passe nada procure um dermatologista  pois ele sabera o que vc tem que usar|`|c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Extermine-as.|`|4b7ff86d60756311ac8d975399354269aa	Procure seu ginecologista.    Acne em mulher jovem pode fazer parte de uma sndrome muito conhecida dos ginecologistas e voc pode precisar de usar medica??o que ir melhorar seu acne.    Voc poder ficar com sua pele linda.    Boa sorte.|`|RxT1wGkxaa	Antes de dormir, passe aquela famosa pomadinha Minancora (aquela do potinho laranja) no rosto, as espinhas secam rapidinho e saem bem facilmente.  N?o tem como ficar sem espinha, pois s?o sujeiras da sua pele,  uma forma do corpo eliminar a sujeira, pra depois seu rosto ficar mais bonito.  O melhor a fazer  cuidar bem dele, como?

A caspa  produto de uma espcie de gordura espelida pelos poros capilares que ao contato com a atmosfera se cristaliza, formando a caspa. O problema tem origem no sistema digestivo e no pancreas e pode ser tratado se for diagnosticado corretamente. A melhor op??o quando n?o se consegue descobrir a origem do problema  manter a higiene dos cabelos, evitando shampoos e cremes muito oleosos.

HLrv8Qlwaa	Ol minha amiga, como sempre os problemas com o cabelo nos assombra n?o  mesmo?  Pois bem, vai uma dica simples, eu nunca tive esse tive de problema, mas tenho uma vizinha que se queixava sempre do cabelo dela ser muito pouco, n?o tinha volume e era muito fraco, alem de cair com frequencia!  Sou consultora de higiene pessoal e beleza a 10 anos, constantemente tenho cursos e treinamentos com grandes empresas do mercado de cosmeticos e beleza. Em um desses cursos, ganhei uma amostra de um t?nico ativador de crescimento para cabelos enfraquecidos..  Direcionei a minha amostra a essa vizinha, e vou te dizer, ela est muito feliz!! aps 20 dias eu a reencontrei e quase n?o a reconheci, fiquei muito satisfeita por ela; Indico o produto com a seguran?a de deixar qualquer consumidora feliz..   bem verdade, que as vezes a alimenta??o pode ajudar, mas essa de prender  bem forte o cabelo... esquece! prender o cabelo, n?o o impede de cair e muito menos ajuda a crescer.. A pior coisa que se pode fazer ao cabelo  prender!! Ele precisa respirar!!  por isso que a Embelleze, se d bem no mercado, n?o  s por ter bons produtos , mas indicam o cabelo solto para manter os resultados.  Bom , voltando ao produto, vc n?o disse de que cidade , portanto segue o site da empresa que tem uma gama de produtos fantasticos para todo tipo de cabelo e solu??o para quase todos os problemas.. Consulte l onde vc encontra a linha  na sua regi?o. www.eskafe.com.br  O produto: T?nico capilar eskafe ativador de crescimento.  muito barato, vc deve encontar a 3,00 cada.  Lembrando que t?nicos s se usa na raiz do cabelo; Vc passa com uma mecha de algod?o, uma vez ao dia. Eles possuem tbm um creme de tratamento intensivo chamado Keraform 10 em 1, tbm seria indicado para o seu caso, pois se o cabelo cai ou n?o cresce pode ser a falta de alguma vitamina no seu organismo, que o cabelo n?o consegue extrair.. mas o problema pode ser resolvido com um bom creme.  Nossa amiga disse que vc teria q se preocupar s com sua alimenta??o. Na verdade uma alimenta??o balanceada e bom para pele e cabelo, mas o cabelo em si, diferente do que se pensa por ai.. ele n?o extrai os beneficios de um produto cosmetico pela raiz..O cabelo possui escamas que se abrem e fecham e  atraves dessas escamas q os produtos agem... Por isso o sucesso das escovas de chocolate, de a?ucar , de morango.. etc Na verdade o procedimento  que  responsavel pelo resultado t?o fantastico... os produtos lavam o cabelo, abrem as escamas, o hidratante entra na cuticula do cabelo e o ultimo item fecha( sela) as escamas e isso d for?a e brilho a qualquer cabelo!! Bom espero ter ajudado, entra l no site, experimente os produtos e n?o esque?a de dar  aqui os resultados.

tklbKP3Qaa	This is a simple problem to solve quickly, dont worry!  1. The bumps on your face - do not put anything on them except the usual. With sunburns you shouldn't irritate your skin anymore than it already is.  2. The sunburn on your body - you should put on soothing lotion to make the peeling process less painfull.  3. Time - the best thing with a sunburn is to just wait. That makes it faster than anything else. Just wait. Do not irritate your skin. I will heal on its own.|`|TzcSU7bIaa	have a nice cool bath, it will relax ur skin so it isnt so tight and painfull|`|WdJ29CfEaa	the best thing to do is to wear sunscreen when you go outside, and when your not outside wear lotion.|`|uwpu0ZbIaa	The bumps are blisters you got from extreme sun exposure, just means you stayed out in the sun too long without sunscreen. Don't worry everyone forgets sometimes lol. Once i got a 2 degree burn on my whole body from not wearing it, so i know how you feel. I used ocean potion instant burn relief, there's different kinds, see if u can find the one called ICE it works best i think. My sunburn went totaly away in 3 days, and by the first day it wasn't hurting anymore and the fever went down. I recomend that you try using it, you can buy it at almost any walmart, walmarts are everywhere so it should be easy to find. It's a gel you just rub on the burn so it's easy to apply and it's not messy so that's good too. Anyways hope your sunburn goes away quick.|`|IbOL868caa	The thing that helps with burns is not only aloe vera but Noxema..its gives a cooling effect...and it feels so good on hot skin. Wear loose light clothing, take bra off as soon as you get out of work and apply aloe and/or Noxema if you want to try it twice a day. Take cool baths or showers. Dont scratch the area, and when it stops burning and your just still red then make sure you put lotion on all the time. You will start peeling like a mofo and if you keep it moisturized then it wont peel as bad, use your luffa or washcloth litely on the skin or it will hurt and make you peel worse.|`|S01bUeHGaa	What you need is aloe vera. If you go to CVS or any drugstore im sure they would have it. Its in a bottle and its green and goopy kinda looks like jello

Watch the sweets, eat veg's, you know the usual.    Brisk walking three time a week won't hurt either.    Grand daughter lost 40lbs by just not eating seconds, and not eating a lot of junk food.  The Foster Home she's in is very stricked when it comes to food.  They have to be.  By the way, she's in Foster Care for Therapeutic reasons.  What heppened, is she asked for a second sandwich and didn't finish it and threw the rest in the the garbade.  No seconds from that point on.  However, the good part of her testing her Foster Mom is that she lost 40lbs and is still loosing a little at a time.    Didn't really want to tell this story, but if it helps your friend to loose weight I'm willing to share this information.  She's 15 and really needed to loose the weight anywat,  Good luck to your friend.|`|sjkfjTBdaa	Eating healthy is always a good start  Cut out the chips and fizzy drink and chocolate.

I'd suggest laps and sit ups they make your weight go down. If you eat rice a lot don't eat too much of it because rice just makes you fat. If you see fat on your food ie. a chicken thigh then rip it off or something. |`|1a796ac0d1261a9a5d9489a7f246a6a0aa	she need to get active! Go on walks, ride a bike, join a club that will keep her busy.

And you can only have water to drink after 7. It sounds silly, but it does work. The above answers were all good, too, but this works for me. The other thing is to make your heart beat faster for just 5 minutes every day; like just run down the street and back or dance to a song or two really hard - whatever gets your heartbeat up. These two things help a lot. Good luck getting through to her!|`|4TwHifVJaa	eating healthy, and run some. Will make you feel better, and get in better shape
H8akJCZZaa	thats fine as long as you dont vigorously swish! just lightly rinse with water, and DEFINATELY dont brush your teeth right after.......but after about 15-20 minutes (after you take them off) you can do whatever you want :)|`|AA10233620	Its ok you are just washing off the leftover cleaning stuff.
6vX06RXkaa	It could be an abscess, I experienced something similar, but I didn't have a hole in my tooth. My tooth had split into two and I had severe bleeding. My mom who is a nurse would have me brush my teeth and rinse it with warm water, it helped, but it made it worse. I couldn't eat on that side and that side of my mouth started to swell. I coped with the pain but taking 800mg Ibprophen using a pill crusher and sprinkling it into pudding.             It took me about two weeks to get an appointment with the dentist. Because of that two week wait my tooth  was in even more bad shape and I was going to have to wait another week to go to a dentist who specializes in oral surgery. They wanted their money upfront and I got charged for every single thing fromt the x-rays from them putting me to sleep. In the end it cost me $900 to get the tooth removed.     Now....the longer you wait, the worse it may get. Thats what happened to me. My mouth is fine now, but it took a long time for me to heal. Times are hard and money is short in this economy, but I would get it checked out just in case...you may end up having to go to a specialist. Just wanted to share my experience.
UOZP4Ma5aa	It depends on your case,
Yn6pM2Xyaa	I do not have partials but my mother does.  A partial DENTURE is a denture with less that a full set of teeth on it.  They wil create it in such a way that it will 'pop' on to your other teeth to hold its place.  As for being comfortable, I have never known someone who has a well made partial to have any problems eating with them, and they eat anything they want, unlike a lot of people who have a full upper or lower set of dentures.  A permanent fixed 'partial' would be called a bridge and it is one or more teeth replacing the missing teeth and then an anchor tooth on each side making a bridge a minimum of 3 teeth.. the two achor them are cemented on to the adjacent teeth of the missing hole like a crown would be placed.  It will stay there for a very long time before needing a replacement.  Flossing under a bridge while a pain in the bum is very important.

The best way is "sit-ups" you can buy a "foot lock" this is a bar fitted with a holder and you slide it across the bottom of a spare door in the house, it will not stop the door opening or closing, you can then lie down, put a foot under each side and with your hands behind your head, slowly pull yourself up, don't over do it to start with, but you will feel the difference, and in a couple of weeks, see the difference.    You can get these easily from any shop that sells weights etc for body building.    Hope this helps.|`|HZuLVEEsaa	Draw a picture of one on a t shirt and wear that every day.

It might be an infection.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	it might be filled too high which is very common and is easy to fix.  she should call up the office and let them know and they should be able to fit her in as an emergency exam.  If it is that the filling is too high it should not cost anything to fix.  It is also possible that the filling was really deep and that there is some nerve sensitivity that may or may not go away. I had that one time when my dentist mistakenly put in an amalgam filling instead of white composite and it cause sensitivity, he took it out, filled it with a temporary filling to see if the nerve settled, and after it did he filled it with amalgam and I never had any further problems with that tooth.|`|9pbj848Aaa	so what you are saying is that she got a fill in and it's starting to dictract her right? well i suggest some pain killers to ease the pain, but if that doesn't work, maybe they did something wrong and has to go and get it check again....
WATEFEvVaa	If you plan to specialize, dental reasearch is going to look good on your application.
YqCpJ3PIaa	It is not uncommon for a temporary to come out.  You wouldn't want your dentist to place it with a more permanent cement that would make it harder to remove in a week to place your permanent crown.  If the crown has to be remade it is not always the doctor's fault.  It could have been an error made at the dental lab.  If you switch you are going to have to pay in full for another crown at another dental office.  I would give him another chance to make it right.  Everyone has an off day sometimes.

pqHxDZqcaa	diarrhea can be many problems but when its something like after a meal  it can be pretty serious. you may have an intestinal disfuction. i'm a doctor with 20 years expirence and when you have something like that its not good at all. i'm sorry to bring you bad news but it may also cause kidney failure and liver failure. you are going to want to go to a doctor asap because this is a very serious issue. the best they can do is give you an ct and make sure it is what it is. they can give you medicine but it wont stop it it just lowers the ammount.  i'm sorry. best of luck to you

d0B3geJNaa	im guessing anywhere in this range 180-205|`|JQZzI49Paa	165 lbs|`|8042b9f17de17d1c61bce115059d4e17aa	As much as you feel comfortable weighing. It isn't really good to go by BMI standards for this. I am a healthy weight and am very happy with my weight but BMI says that I should weigh about 20lbs more than I do now Now my boyfriend on the other hand is athletic but is considered obese by BMI. I think depending on your body style 180-200 should be a good range for you.|`|iZDsMCghaa	This depends on your muscle mass and body frame but a general idea would be 170-225  My husband is 6ft, weighs 205.

So you can judge from there.|`|Yd7kM30naa	your BMI should 18-26......which means you should weight no more than 180. Anyone saying above that might want to get your brain looked into. About 170-180. THERE SHOULD NEVER BE A GAP IN BETWEEN YOUR RANGES GOING OVER 9 OR 10 POUNDS.|`|nbChnDIBaa	There are too many genetic factors that you have to consider.    1. Your ethnicity and ancestral line?  Samoan vs. Ethiopian, 1st generation or 5th?  2. Your muscular & skeletal frame?  Ectomorph, Endomorph, Mesomorph?   3. Your geographic location? (This matters due to available nutrients and food.  Available sunlight or UV rays.  Are you in the US/UK or in Somalia?).  4. Health.  Are you an athlete? Do you have a family history of medical issues ie. Diabetes, Heart Disease etc.  5. Your age?  The density and weight of your bones change with age.    As an overall average, at 6'-0" for a male in his 20's, he should be 190 - 220 lbs ( 86 - 100 kilos).|`|fKedbYR4aa	I'm pretty sure a healthy weight for someone 6'1" is anywhere from about 165-190.

For an accurate depiction, though, you would need to visit your doctor and have him measure your muscle to fat ratio, because muscle is healthier than fat.  If you weight 180 and the majority of your weight is fat, then even though you're in the acceptable range, this does make your body more 'healthy'.|`|aLHNF9peaa	probably between 170-220|`|AA10894614	First thing you need to figure out is your BMI.

I consider myself pretty active, am 6' and weigh 200 lbs.  That being said according to google and all the retarded charts i'm considered overweight.

N9nJWYa5aa	Much depends on your goals.  The whole thing about concentrating on muscle groups is only really relevant if you are bodybuilding or trying to get fit rapidly from a pretty poor starting point.    If on the other hand you are not that out of shape, it can be more productive to try a variety full body disciplines, basically whatever takes your fancy on the day, while trying to get in strength, flexibility, and cardio on a regular basis.|`|vEGkSHMsaa	You should use those 45 minutes doing more beneficial exercises.

gERaZGZeaa	It is rude.  Everybody's goal should be to have a healthy body by eating properly and exercising.  Sounds like you are - don't let people who don't understand put you down.      The next time they give you a hard time for not eating doughnuts, just say something like "no thanks, I don't like those.  I prefer apples (or whatever you brought for a snack that day) instead."    Gets the point across without insulting their (incredibly unhealthy) tastes - and maybe they'll just leave you alone when they go out for the Burger King run.|`|yhX02yuNaa	Take the high road and don't be rude to them.  They're just jealous.  Not only jealous of your new size, but also jealous of your willpower in sticking to healthy and nutritious foods.|`|iZDsMCghaa	Ive been there. They say your too thin when actually your the one who is at the healthy weight.  Yes,theyre jealous. Like you said you dont have to eat donuts and your not starving just because you know when to stop. They are jealous and these comments arent going to stop anytime soon. Just stick by what your doing :D congrats!|`|gSwobfujaa	i think theyre just giving you a hard time to be funny. besides misery loves company. thats why people who do drugs tend to only stick with people who do drugs. people who are alcoholics tend to stick with other alcoholics. and overweight people who dont actually want to work on eating healthy tend to stick with other people who do not care about a healthy lifestyle. they could be skinny as well but its probably not in their comfort zone. its competition. listen. i dunno if these girls are jealous or not...they could just be joking around. either way just stick to ur goal and try not to be so defensive. even if they r doing it on purpose to be mean then screw them anyways. take care.|`|AA11447210	You're choosing to let it bother you. Yes, they are jealous in a way and they also probably miss the 'old' you that used to indulge right along with them.    Simply politely decline and leave it at that. No need to let your feelings be hurt. Be proud of your accomplishment and understand they are likely upset because they haven't found the willpower to do what you did...yet.    Don't preach, don't make an issue of trying to stay small or be healthy (unless they push it) but simply say "I'm far from starving, but thank you for caring" and smile sweetly.|`|YQ8YsYepaa	First off gratz on your life change!!! I think its wonderful you had the discipline and drive to do something so healthy for yourself. As for the girls you work with, yes their comments are rude and most likely stem from jealousy. It's easier for them to put you down and say mean things because it makes them feel better and justified for not taking the initiative to get healthier themselves.   Its easy for me or anyone else to tell you to ignore their comments, but we're not the ones receiving them , you are. Do your best to maintain a polite stance. Your dietary decisions are none of their business. You know you are eating healthy, and they probably do too.   I'm unsure of how you should retort if at all. I'm a bit confrontational and would tell them that i prefer to stay healthy and not eat that junk. Probably not the best way to keep things at work on an even keel however. Someone else is probably better to give you some direction on that one.   I want to give you some encouragement though,  you have done well for yourself and should be proud of your accomplishment. Keep up your regiment and stay healthy.|`|AA12182074	Been there, done that.  They're jealous.

I'm guessing their jealous. Don't starve urself though, but don't try to gain weight just to make them feel better.|`|jhNUuz0maa	they are jealous. They know you were once like them, but you made the effort to make yourself look and feel better. To them you are starving yourself, because you don't eat what they eat. You should ignore what they say, and just move on with life. If it really bugs you, just tell them its not a healthy food choice and you would rather eat something with less calories. You could even joke about it, tell them you could eat that, but then you would have to add an hour to your workout, and you really don't have that much time. Or, even joke and say, your right, I am starving myself, but you are trying to get back to your original weight, your birth weight.|`|10ef8c48e3ba55a59f16e3badd0a5b52aa	firstly at work you can report them for bullying   and secondly tell them you used to be like them and you took control and now stick to a strict diet and you watch what you eat|`|467Rz7S2aa	I feel your pain.  Statistics show that if you are surrounded by people who are overweight, you are more likely to be overweight yourself.  Here in America we are 20-30 pounds overweight on average, and this is because slowly but surely our idea of what is normal and acceptable has been blown way out of proportion.  In Europe and Asia the average clothing size is 6-8, so people who are 2-4 are considered thin, and people who are 10-12 are in the "need to lose weight" category.  When I was losing weight everyone started worrying I was getting to thin around the time I reached a size 12, and with the average American being a size 14 I now see why.  We have grown to the point where we actually see a size 12 (a size at which the average person is still 10-15 pounds overweight based on BMI) as "too small" because our view of "normal" is a size 14.  If you are even smaller than a size 12, your friends are not merely jealous (although they probably are a little jealous) but concerned that your weight has fallen below the norm.  Any doctor will tell you that "the norm" in America is far, far above where you should be, but psychologically your friends and family will begin to count you as "underweight" if you get more than 1 size under "the norm."  You are probably not underweight if you can fit in regular department store clothing sizes, but your friends, due to their distorted view of "normal" as a result of social conditioning, believe you are too thin when you reach a size eight (which by the way is the size Jessica Simpson was when her "weight gain scandal" began.    My best advice is to tell your friends where you are on the health scale.  I like to say, "Actually, my BMI puts me exactly in the middle of my correct weight range.  You think I'm too thin because I'm smaller than average, not because I'm unhealthy."  When my friends remark that I need a doughnut or exercise too much, I simply point out that all conventional medical wisdom, including my own doctor, disagree with them.
AA12182074	I'm personally a fan of jogging and pilates.

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.    Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.    Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

Looking at how I've been losing weight now, vs. how I could have kept it off (reasonably) in college here are some tips that might help:    The biggest thing is to avoid stress.  - Schedule your time: parties and social life need to come second if you want to feel relaxed. Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to study and get your homework done.  - Get enough sleep. Even if you don't have time to have 7-8 hours a night, at least try to sleep at the same time every night.  - Identify any other sources of stress and try to come up with a solution to make it manageable, for example if money is constantly a problem, try to make yourself a budget.    Try to watch what you eat.  - Avoid fast food. Buy groceries and prepare meals ahead of time if you're eating on-the-go.  - Drink lots of water.  - Drink less (or no) soda.  - Try eating lots of fruits... apples are the easiest to me. Remember 5 a day? They make a great snack and they'll help you avoid snacking on less healthy foods.  - Also, add vegetables to your regular diet.  - Don't under-nourish yourself. Your body will think you are starving and hold on to every piece of fat it can.    Other than that, choose physically involving methods of transportation... if you can walk or take a bike instead of your car, do so! Try to squeeze in whatever exercise you can.    These are all good habits anyways, and they really aren't that difficult. Remember, don't compare yourself to yesterday, always compare yourself to at least a week ago or you will get discouraged about your progress.
clSvfDmVaa	I just read that just about any way they are cooked they are good for you.  Scrambled, sunny side up, sunny side down, poached, any way where you don't add any additional fat.  Personally I do an omelet with a low fat cheese, veggies, 2 egg whites and one whole egg.|`|OLTjkS4zaa	You know I am not 100% sure on that.  But I only eat the whites to avoid the fat in the yolk.  One other thing you could do is use one whole egg and then an egg white or two depending on how much you want to eat.  If you are worried about vitamins take a daily supplement.  But I honestly think you will be fine with just egg white. You eat other things right.  Add veggies and make an egg white omelet. They are supper yummy.|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	i buy egg beaters...they are a little more expensive than buying regular carton eggs but on my diet plan im eating eggs every morning and the yolks of eggs contain a lot of good ingredients but also a lot of cholesterol so i buy egg beaters which still have all the good vitamins and stuff that come with the yolk but just the cholesterol removed so its very healthy
NhF9sM5jaa	It is possible that her cycle has changed making her a few days later or she could be under a lot of stress.    The best thing you can do (both of you) is to go get a pregnancy test. Atleast that way you will know.    Good luck  And try having "safer sex" from now on to avoid the anxiety again|`|u3gkczBOaa	well, ur both dumb to be having sex in the first place! ur way too young! but, if she is pregnant (i hope not) may that be a lesson to you. but if it's only 5 days late, i wouldn't stress out about it. if she doesn't have it in the next week, see a doctor, u might be in trouble. best of luck!|`|xPOIRRxxaa	if she has been hanging out with other females, then no its nothing to worry about because its said that if you change your circle of friends or who you are around all the time that your cycle could change. this happened to me once, i moved in with a couple of friends and i missed mine for almost a month and then whatda know i started mine the same day that my 2 roomates did. just to be sure though i would suggest a pregnancy test.|`|tV9LqeYcaa	No, if she is stressed out about something then her period will be delayed. If she doesn't have her period within the next 3-4 days then there is a good possibility that she might be pregnant.|`|OY6R4ZP1aa	5 days is not probelem. I would not worry till lit get to be a couple of weeks and she does not have her period.|`|aTbZgjJMaa	I'm fifteen and my cycle changes constantly.

RY1xuwzoaa	Just re-introduce carbs into your diet over a few hours time.  Don't eat a bunch all at once so you avoid shocking your body...    Your body can be in mild keytosis even if the piss-strip isn't changing colors.    No worries tho - just don't go crazy and eat a 1/2 gallon of ice cream at once and you'll be fine :P

NRfs81Raaa	Yes. You have obviously made a good change for the better in the area of your diet and your body has reacted favorably. If you watch the show "the biggest loser" the contestants on that show can lose 5-15 pounds a week consistently through the same kind of changes you have made but on a more drastic scale.    Don't listen to your family as cutting out 8 cans of soda a day is not unhealthy for anyone.     I am sure you will find that some weeks you will not lose any weight. But, don't get discouraged, if you keep applying the same diet and activity level the weight will come off.|`|Iy36xZMOaa	NO, I don't think so.  As long as you are eating enough to get by and are exercising then you are fine.  If you start to feel faint and are dizzy, that might mean you need to eat more.  Talk to a professional and get some advice.|`|kT4I3C6caa	Good that you are determined!  But slow it down!  Yes you are losing too much too soon!

Drastic changes has its effect on people; you might feel lethargic and soon give up.|`|OLTjkS4zaa	yes there is such a thing as loosing weight too fast.  But from time to time the body will just shed off a lot of weight at first and then slow back down to a normal 1 - 2 pounds a week.  Keep and eye on it and if you keep loosing that fast you might want to consider if what your doing is truly healthy for you.  Also if you have a considerable amount of weight to loose like over 100 pounds then it might be different for you.|`|1Txef261aa	You are losing muscle not fat, try slowly reducing your calories whike eating healthy and increasing the exercise

Zo8RhY9Iaa	Psychology, is very important in your overall health.  Yes it is possible you can do that. Look up Ramachandron he is a famous clinical psychologist who has dealt with things like phantom limb syndrome.    People actually believe they have limbs that are not there.      You can be convinced you are sick if enough people say you look bad today.  The mind-body connection is very real!

Its not weird|`|y8HyP1bzaa	What is "normal" anyway?  If you want to shave, shave.  If you don't, don't!  It's a personal decision.|`|91c6bKdwaa	its normal to do both... i know alot of girls that i know do shave and some others dont. so its all a personal choice|`|e21NzZ6Qaa	I do shave it all.

Hope you feel better!|`|kj507W26aa	It could, but every women is different. Drink lots of water to flush out the toxins and try 100% Cranberry Juice ( Not that cranberry cocktail stuff loading in sugar).

Cranberry juice all the way!|`|CcxqcyH4aa	yes i agree my lil sis had it and thts what she did and no|`|tP4Bx4OWaa	I would say a mild infection can be cured by drinking cymalon sachets and  cranberry juice, which does detox the bladder but if it is causing you to have a  fever, pain and sickness, or passing blood, it really needs something stronger, from the Dr|`|7Bjvmfyiaa	Hell no! Listen to me and get some treatment! UTI is not something you want to play around with!  What I did once was took meds for it only until I felt it was gone...and you what happened??? Every since then, I am very sensitive. So, please, trust me it is a must to get a treatment!!!!!|`|1FdChAzCaa	Eventually, yes, your body should be able to fight off the UTI, but how long it takes will vary from person to person.  How bad is your UTI?  If it's mild, I would try some home remedies like drinking lots of fluids and cranberry juice to flush out your system.  If it's bad or if it turns worse in the next several days (burning sensation/pain when you're peeing, fever, abdominal pain, etc.) I would consider going to your doctor and getting antibiotics (UTI's are very common btw) so you don't have to suffer.|`|9D9f1bIxaa	think  not   you have to go get the antibiotics  or  you will start bleeding  when you go  peeeeeeee
5N3odm3Qaa	My personal trainer is $75-$150 per hour. Her rate fluctuates depending on the activity du jour and the client.    However, mine is certainly not from the YMCA. I would imagine their rates to be considerably cheaper.|`|vi34WKOqaa	The rates that the PT's at my 24hr gym charge is about $50-$60/per hour-long session, depending on the   of sessions you purchase. FYI, this is in Virginia, U.S.    Good luck in achieving your fitness goals!|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	or an easier way and cheaper way is to pick out someone that looks really good in the gym...the way you would like to look and go up to them and talk to them...and most likely they will be able to either workout with you and show you their routine and give you a lot of tips on nutrition and training for what you want...or will be able to tell you what to do...|`|7760825bab2c4f1260c4d463c9a7f14aaa	They charge between $25 an hour to more. and could also have a package rate which depend on the trainer..
CTwTFLmUaa	Diet is always the first place to start.  Learn to count calories.   That will be your biggest tool.      If you want to target your legs, there is a machine at my gym called a stepmill.  It looks like a mini escalator.  You're basically walking up the down escalator.  It is an *** kicker!  A great cardio workout as well as a good leg work out.  Lunges are also one of my favorites.|`|qslROmIMaa	run/jog/walk    umm try leg excersises?  -not sure.   (:|`|Iy36xZMOaa	You could do weights and also walking or jogging can help.

0a7a0027e0ce28f6f9d73ee5c3610710aa	The major cause of anemia in children is a faulty diet i.e.not eating or filling the belly with junk food only or worm infestation.You may approach school authorities with blood test report of the child and seek special permission till the time this condition is cured.
tP4Bx4OWaa	It is to do with how little exercise you have taken as well as how much you have eaten, a small weight gain of 4lb is  through holding in water on the pill in certain women prone to bloating but taking the pill doesn't make people fat, eating more and slower metabolism does. Come off the pill and I guarantee in 9 months time, you will have gained over 2 stone. lol

That's serious, you need to tell your parents. They're the best people who could help you other than a doctor. Even though they may have named your bro 'Happy Easter", they know what's best for you. You should talk to them about seeing a doctor, or maybe talk to your school nurse if you dont want to tell them. Pretend like it happened in class or something if you can't talk to your parents. I love you and i don't want you to end up in bad health. lol, i had a brain seizure today, and i couldn't remember anyone's name. i just spaced. love ya. don't die. (ps, i blogged)
0m7kEIDiaa	I think it's because people don't tend to do as you say.  If they did, you are right, they would stay the weight they were.      But people who look for a quick fix by eating far fewer calories than their body really needs, will go very hungry and when they get to  the weight they want they tend to go back to eating as they did before. and end up  putting  it all back on again.  If you eat a little less and lose a little less  quickly your mind and body get used to eating that amount and it''s easier to keep to it.|`|JoIyi9gsaa	a 1000 calorie a day deficit is fine , i done it and stayed the same.  Anorexics hardly eat at all ever!|`|clSvfDmVaa	Anorexics don't stay skinny for long.  One of two things happen, they get treatment and are no longer anorexics or they die.  When you eat less than 1000 calories your body starts eating itself to stay alive and, while you lose weight, you cause permenant damage to your body.  It's extremely unhealthy and can lead to death.|`|884f83163d9d5ff77266c433b41779baaa	because people who lose weight quickly usually go back to their old eating habits which is why they put the weight back on.Anorexics rarely eat anything permanently. Just eating fruit and veg is not sufficient your body needs protein calcium carbohydrate to function efficiently.
cRdeb0T1aa	Chances are, by this point, your friends have noticed your tics, and just chalk them up to "the way you are."  The next time you are ticcing and they ask about it, you can just shrug and say, "it's just my tourettes."  This will lead to a discussion about your tourettes.      Sometimes my friends would let me know, "you're doing it again," and that is also a good time to bring it up.  Don't worry too bad, if they are your friends, they've noticed, and it doesn't bother them, cause they like you just the way you are.|`|s6b3RnsWaa	Are you sure you have it?     I only say that because that is something I have a hard time believing someone can hide unless they are virtual friends.   Otherwise, just explain it to them like it's not a big deal and then expect some friends to remain friends, while others will not. Better off anyway, right.
OLTjkS4zaa	I was told your weight x 15= the amount of calories to maintain your current weight.|`|yDadok18aa	It is really hard to calculate the number of calories one should take in one day, but if you want to lose weight, calculating calories is not the best way. there are many other ways to lose weight, you might find this weight loss website helpful:http://www.breaknewpaths.com/category/we...
ZlVPMsWTaa	Your sore throat is caused by post-nasal drip from your sinusitis. I had it last year and my throat was so sore, it felt like I swallowed a rock and I thought I had strep, but didn't. All you can do is drink warm liquids and rest until your sinusitis clears up.

nopHdd9Kaa	A daily calorie deficit tends to be the amount between what you need to maintain your current weight and what you actually take in.  Say you need 2500 calories a day but you only eat 2000, that leaves you a deficit of 500.  Most people use calorie deficits for short term weight loss and it is not recommended for an extended period of time.    This deficit can be gotten by either cutting out the 500 calories or by working it off by doing some form exercise.|`|JYtqx9dSaa	This simply means that you need to eat fewer calories than you burn.
Ms72jNbBaa	On the zappos.com web site, there is a number given to call so you can talk with an expert about shoes for special needs.  My husband has high arches, and I had almost given up finding sandals that had enough room over the arches.  The sandals were necessary because he had decubitus ulcers on his heel, so I checked on the Internet and found zappos.  The expert was very personable, and he immediately directed me to the shoes that "all the doctors recommend."  They paid the postage, and would have paid the return postage, if necessary, but the sandals were perfect - they had continuous straps that adjusted to his feet exactly as needed.    The Zappos expert might very well be able to help you solve your problem as well.  They are most of all dedicated to customer service.      Good luck!|`|ee74f3aa67efefa8e49e21be6f4ec61faa	I have very flat feet and had a doctor tell me that New Balance shoes were very good for people with flat feet.

xRvetiAMaa	Yes, an ENT or Plastic Surgeon can properly repair your nose, inside & out to look 'normal' again. When that doc diagnoses your trouble as requiring correction for health reasons, insurances should cover it. (such as impeding breathing, improper drainage, severe headaches, pain from improper fracture healing or words to that effect).    Make it clear to the ENT or Surgeon that you have some 'trouble': just making it look better may not be covered at this time.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Man that's a lot and a waste of money.|`|72cef19a31314b3ec0ec5517673d7929aa	I work in an Operating Room and they can "shave off" that part of the bone that is sticking out a little bit.   As far as your insurance, that's something you would have to check with your insurance carrier or the doctor. Some insurances consider this kind of surgery (since the accident happened 5 years ago) cosmetic.

Ms72jNbBaa	Dear swapna:    That's a long time for the toes to be irritated!  I had been going to ask you if you have changed laundry detergent, or have you switched to wool socks because of the cold.  But it seems you would be affected on both feet, or other places on your body, for one of those reasons.    Are you pretty sure it isn't a fungus, like athlete's foot or something?    My fingers get itchy when it's cold and dry and I wash them and they get drier.  I put Vaseline Intensive Relief on them, and that helps.    Not being a medic, I can only offer suggestions.  You might try aloe vera gel, or plain vaseline, and you might soak your foot in epsom salts solution or boric acid solution.  You might try restricting your socks to cotton and change them a couple of times a day.  Corn starch or foot powder within the sock might bring some relief.    Have you taken your temperature?  If it is elevated from your usual reading, you might have some kind of infection and might ask for an antibiotic.  Do you have diabetes?  It certainly wouldn't hurt to check with someone who IS medically knowledgeable.    So much to worry about these days!  Sometimes I think my little itches and pains are a way of expressing my discomfort with the world I live in!    Lots of luck in getting these symptoms to settle down.
2TDBlBbNaa	Are you waiting for it that anxiously?  Discharge has nothing to do with a period.  Discharges are normal and it's the body's way of cleaning the vagina.  Most girls first start mentruation around the ages of 12 or 13 and it can come as early as age 8 I believe.  I should't worry about it because you will definitely see it when your body is ready.|`|m7putYGmaa	i had discharge for a good 2 years before i got my period....    and between periods you will still have it    theres no sure fire way to tell until you look in your undies that day =D    ahaha dont rush it!!! you're gonna hate it and wish you never got it|`|u3gkczBOaa	i've been having the same thing and im not totally sure what to do but i just started my period and the same thing is happening so maybe it's just something some girls do when they start. i have a question posted about it right now. ; )
QvIqTiaxaa	I have been type I since age 8.  I have 3 kids, and when I was pregnant I counted every calorie I ate, measured the green beans and what have you, the first 2 kids were fine, and my drs told me they were surprised at how small they were (normal sized) because diabetic moms tend to have giant fat babies because of the excess sugar.  With my 3rd kid, I didn't know I was pregnant till later on in the pregnancy because I was having periods, totally not related to diabetes, but since I wasn't taking great care of my bloodsugar the first part of the pregnancy and my sugar was running sometimes very high during the pregnancy, my kid was born premie and with slight nerve damage to her face. Nerve damage to the baby is one of the symptoms caused by high blood sugar in the mom.  You should be able to have a normal pregnancy as long as it is planned and you are very very strict with yourself with your diet and excercise. also keep in mind that your kids have a large chance of becoming diabetics also since it is a hereditary disease. my dad is diabetic and 2 of his 3 kids have it.|`|KJGmpphUaa	Depends I guess,  I have a friend who has it also and was told he would have a hard time having kids.......he now has 5 so apparently some people still can.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I don't know about a lot of kids.  But you might be able to have 2 or 3, that's about all I've heard is healthy.  Pregnancy and diabetes don't mix well.  Before you even get pregnant, you have to get your BG under extremely strict control, and they'll usually want you to be on a pump.  Then you have to maintain very strict BG throughout the pregnancy.  There are huge risks of miscarriage and birth defects, so this is very risky.  But it can be done.
AA11614449	I believe I read somewhere that after a guy finishes the chemicals released in the brain after the excitement are actually sleep horomones.

Men can get very drowsy after they orgasm, it's just natural. There's a lot of things men put up with when it comes to women, and vice versa. So best not to give us guys a hard time about it. ;)|`|AlmBtA2eaa	if you've ever had a really good orgasm you know it could be pretty tiring.|`|JwUHCwcJaa	Sex takes a lot of energy specially for men. From the beginning of the activity (foreplay) when sexual excitement tends to increase til the time men come (where men hit the peak of the curve), sexual excitement tends to drop drastically. Some men, the time in between intercourse is short and they can go on and on. For most, the interval between sexual activity that ends in ejaculation tends to be far in between. These men need rest.|`|BMYOukx5aa	because after having an orgasm in both males and females, the body releases a chemical called Oxytocin which is the same chemical that women excrete in  breastfeeding that puts the baby asleep.

UZxeBrxQaa	No!    But if you don't get a calcium substitute in your diet, you will walk and dance like a boneless chicken.  This is to be avoided.

AA11785060	Given that 99% of all guys DO masturbate, yeah, pretty abnormal NOT to masturbate, just a natural act that most males do as a result of their natural urges.  Society and religion-based society has deemed masturbation "bad" and this is based on several concepts, not all true by the way-- since many people believe wrongly that masturbation "wastes" sperm cells, and man will run out, masturbation was considered bad since populations needed to remain healthy and increase-- to help support the church with new members for one thing.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Your body is designed to have rather frequent ejaculations. Your choice of the words "giving in" implies that you're not supposed to ejaculate, like it's some kind of test, which is nonsense from a physiological perspective.    Now, if you don't *want* to, you don't have the desire to do it, that is fine also. It doesn't have to be done. My point is only that the desire to ejaculate is natural and serves a purpose in the survival of the species. So don't beat yourself up over it either way.    However, if you have the drive to have sex or at least ejaculate, as most men do, and you don't masturbate or have sex, you will have nocturnal emissions a.k.a. wet dreams. Nothing really bad will happen to you physically, although over the years you will be at risk for inappropriate expression of your repressed sexuality. Think about the high incidence of priests molesting children. This isn't because the church is evil or something, it's because they're supposed to spend their entire lives having no sex.|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Maybe ring the Vatican and ask to speak to the Pope? He should be an expert on such matters.|`|fPJTZwoUaa	the emissions will flow outta ur nose mouth and eyes if u relly get full up .     no he wont get stressed or think more about sex his hole will heal up and he will be unable to have intercourse  as the dstrophy of the pelvic muscles   -   the sad thing is that he will be unable to father children as he will become completley cel;ibate and unable to perform in any capacity as a man -  his brain will lose its ability to detect the sexual urge and brain cell will die leading to an dementia type disease|`|IVjspiStaa	Is it abnormal to NOT masturbate?      yes.|`|pD329JO2aa	you will get cranky|`|yzOtKTJIaa	My husband says if he doesnt get sex at least once a week his balls will explode.

Normal teenage and twenty year olds masturbate and/or have sex between 2 and 8 times a day.  The frequency begins to drop off in late twenties.  Any male that does not allow the normal function of his sex organs (i.e. to ejaculate) will experience a number of symptoms that will affect his mental and physical being.  It is not difficult to get firm answers on this subject from your local library or from sensible internet searches.|`|NUYcziH7aa	well nothing like that happens it's just the normal way to get rid of the fluids which it doesn't need by night falls or through your urine|`|HAGjS33naa	If you can overcome the mental urge, and constant boners then with time you'll adjust fine. I guess it's similar to an addiction in that sense.     I admire your masochism xD|`|WMkJ1GQyaa	I actually tried it out for 3 months just for the heck of it. After the first two weeks you feel your balls somewhat full as in if you use your fingers to squeeze the tubes coming out of the testicles, you would be able to feel them filled. Other than that you feel pretty normal.    After the two weeks you don't get horny so easily. Your balls stay the same size. You body starts to recycle and break down all the protein in your sperm and return into your body. This is when you feel more alert and strong. Also during this time your system will expel the remaining fluid from time to time. This happens after you finish peeing, you will feel your pc muscles relaxing just like when you *** but without the feeling and little drops of fluid ooze out. Then for another two weeks everything is normal again and the whole cycle continues.    When you reach the 3rd month, you may have the most realistic, ecstatic sex in your dreams when you most not expect it. For me it felt so damn good and I was doing it with 2 beautiful maidens and they were out of this world. I ended up with the most powerful orgasm I even experienced!     Wet myself good and proper though. The above is just my experience though. Different people may have different experiences. ;)

Speak to an endocrinologist (not a general practitioner) about this.  An endocrinologist will have more information about how to control (or even lose weight) and control your blood sugar.

SQzku8AQaa	could be that you have a good metabolism in which anything you eat gets burned up quicker than other people can digest food and so then it has an empty stomach, so it wants more.     my suggestions are that you should eat more protein, fiber, and dietary fats. those three nutrients starve off hunger and keep you satisfied. when you are hungry, it is basically that it is contracting on an empty stomch so i would focus more on fats because fats stay in your stomach longer. same with proteins. it takes more calories to burn proteins because they are so hard to digest in our bodies. foods high in fats, are peanut butter and most nuts. it could be also that you arent getting enough water. you should be taking 8 8-12oz glasses which is the regulated amount or the other figure is i think to take how much you weigh and that should be the amount in oz of water you should consume daily.|`|4uDEukF9aa	It really is not a big deal...either you are going through a growthspurt like me or you are pregnant.|`|AA10563860	sounds like you got a tape worm.  you eat a lot of pork?  consider a colon cleanse, or see a dr for meds.

If the protein doesn't help, you may have another issue that needs to be medically addressed.

Is it while you are  doing the exercise or after? If it is while you are doing it, are you doing the exercise properly? By hurt do you mean a burning , heated feeling or actual pain? If it is a burning , heated feeling, it could be the muscle working hard. If it is actual pain, STOP! Get the help of a trainer. If it is after you work out it could be because you did not stretch the muscles as they cooled.Get advice from a trained person before you hurt yourself. Good Luck

tnEIPjccaa	A pap smear is when the doctor takes a small sample of cells form your cervix, and will have a lab examine them to make sure there are no abnormalities. The procedure is a little awkward, but relatively painless. What they will do, is they will put you in an examining room, and make you get into a gown, and lie down on a table with your legs up in stirrups. The doctor will insert a speculum which makes it possible for her to put in a swab to take the cell sample. At that point he/she may feel around on your abdomen while pressing up on your uterus to feel any abnormalities that way, and ask you in your feel any pain while they are pressing. They may even examine your breasts for lumps. All depending on how thorough your doctor is. Mine does all of these.    and no, its not against the rules to bring a friend or family member with you, and I don't think they'll argue, if it makes you more comfortable.|`|sndBzQzAaa	All the gyno does during a pap smear is scrape some cells off your cervix...he takes a little wooden spatula-looking thing and runs it along the outside of the cervical entrance, then takes a little brush and spins it around in the opening itself...it doesn't hurt or anything, it's just to spread them on a slide and look at them under a microscope for cervical cancer cells.|`|ruy9vjtYaa	your friends can go in with you or whoever basically what they do is you have to get undressed and place your feet in the stirrups (metal U-shapes) then she sticks a speculum in your vagina so she can she the insides , and then she inserts a swab [[q-tip like thing]] and rub it ac cross your cervex to sample some cells , honestly i was soo worked up and didnt want to do this part and i guess my muscles were too tight and it wasnt really pleasant so some advise dont be scared at all , its takes like 30 seconds probably even less and its real easy , anyway next she will check your internal organs with her/his hands , after that its all done=]    ok well to be perfectly honest i am 12 and i had to get this done just a couple weeks ago , because of unpleasant events not because i do anything but if i could go through with the exam im positively sure you can lol and its not that bad as everyone makes it out to be , good luck =]|`|aTk0A9SHaa	Your doctor can do a Pap test during a pelvic exam. It is a simple and quick test. While you lie on an exam table, the doctor puts an instrument called a speculum into your vagina, opening it to see the cervix. She will then use a special stick or brush to take a few cells from inside and around the cervix. The cells are placed on a glass slide and sent to a lab for examination. While usually painless, a Pap test is uncomfortable for some women|`|K6KeN7sgaa	You get up on the examination table, put your feet in the stirrups, spread you legs, and the doctor will use a metal tool (I think it's called a speculum) to open your vaginal canal. Doesn't hurt, you just have to relax.    He then takes a long swab - just like a Q-tip, and dabs at the cervix (at the very back of your vaginal canal) so that he can do a culture on those cells, to see if they're cancerous or even abnormal.    It's very important that all women have regular Pap smears - if you catch the cancer early enough, it can be the difference between living and dying.|`|YEd9Q5KZaa	It is a test for cervical cancer. I've never had one, but they scrape cells off of your cervix.

It wasn't that bad when I went, but it's different for others because some gyno's can be really rough. It's embarassing but eventually everyone hast go get one.    Also, they may insert two fingers into your vagina in order to feel and make sure everything is okay for the pelvic exam. Don't worry, the gyno wears gloves and uses lube. The pelvic exam is way more uncomfortable than the papsmear, but doesn't hurt at all.    Here is a good website if you would like to know more    http://women.webmd.com/guide/pap-smear|`|6Cqj7D8zaa	A Pap Smear is when you go to your OBGYN and they have you put your 2 feet in a stirup and they always put a cold device into your vagina so it can spread you open.

ijduNTgyaa	Ok for eating, dont eat junk...duh, thats easy a lot of people know that. Try to not eat a lot of salty things, it traps water in you and it doesnt help you lose weight. Drink lots and lots of water, stay away from slim fast/vitamin water/energy drinks, some might be good the energy drinks are horrible for you and water beats them all out for quality and its FREE! Water is the bodies oil. Drink more and youll feel great. Try to eat small but more portions of good food throughout the day, it speeds up your matabolism.     To burn fat, you need cardio and lots of it. Go running, biking, swimming, jump rope is pretty good and fun sometimes and rowing.     But if your serious about losing FAT you need to forget about your scale and just look at your body. Muscle weighs a lot more than fat so if you start working out and get discouraged because your gaining weight its because your getting toner, and thats a good thing!     Ok then, some good work outs for ya...These are gonna be good for ya because you dont even need a gym or any real equipment, just mostly dead weight exercises.    For the buns  Plie  Stand with feet slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, arms at sides, toes turned out.  Tuck tailbone under and contract glutes.  Lower body into a plie squat as low as you can go without allowing knees to creep past toes.  Simultaneously raise arms to shoulder height in front of body, palms down. Hold for 2 seconds, then return to starting position.  After 20 reps, pulse at the bottom for 20 seconds.    Hip-Lift Progression  This is an awesome way to relieve tension in your lower back and work your butt at the same time. (A cushy mat will keep your tailbone from crying afterward.)  Lie on your back with your arms at your sides with your knees bent and your feet on the floor.  Lift your hips toward the ceiling. Hold for 1 count, and then lower back down.  Repeat the lifts for 60 seconds, squeezing your glutes and hamstrings at the top of the range of motion. Be careful not to overarch your spine.  To make this exercise more difficult, extend one leg at the top of the lift. Keep your thighs parallel and hold the lifted position for about 5 seconds.  Keeping your hips up, place your foot back on the floor and then lower your hips.  Repeat this exercise for 30 seconds; switch sides and do the move for another 30 seconds on the other     Dumbbell Squats  A simple way to kick off even a quickie workout, these squats are powerful little moves. Over time, increase reps and dumbbell weight to amp them up.  Start with your feet shoulder-width apart and 8- to 10-pound dumbbells by your thighs.  Squat down as if you were going to sit in a chair, keeping your weight over your heels.  Squeeze your glutes as you return to the start position.  Do 15-20 reps.  As you continue, keep the weight in your heels, making sure your knees do not past forward of your toes.  For a bigger challenge, try it without the weights, jump explosively, and land in the squat position.    Legs  do lots of squats. also do leg lifts on your side and your back (lay on your back and SLOWLY lift you legs up and down, if it doesnt hurt, do it a lot slower. shoot for 25 lifts, if it doesnt hurt, go to 50)    arms  Bicep Exercises  Standing Barbell Curls   1. grab your weight with an underhand grip with feet shoulder width apart  2 . allow the weight to hang in front of you, keeping your elbows close to you at all times.   3. moving only your forearms bring the weight into your shoulders.  4. hold for about 5 seconds and then repeat.   Dumbbell Concentration Curls  1. sit on the end of a bench with your legs spread  2. reach down in between your legs and pick up a light weight with one hand.  3. place your elbow on your knee and make sure your arm is fully straight.  4. place your other hand on your other knee so the upper body has some support.  5. using your forearm only bring the weight to your shoulder and hold for a few seconds.   6. repeat and then switch arms  Triceps exercises  Lying Barbell Extentions  1. lie on a workout bench with feet shoulder length apart on each side.  2. grab the weight and hold it above your head with your arms straight.  3. using your forearms only, lower the weigh until it is about one inch above your forehead.  4.then push the weight back to starting position and then repeat.  Tricep Dumbbell Extensions  1. grab a light weight with one hand with feet shoulder length apart  2. lift the weight so your arms are straight above your head  3. slowly lower the weight behind your head  4. then slowing lift the weight again above your head until your in the starting position.  5. repeat for one set of 10 times and then do the same for the other arm.  Forearm exercises  Barbell Wrist Curls  1. grab a weight with your wrists facing down.   2. sit on a workout bench with your arms resting on your legs and your wrists hanging over the bench.   3. using your forearm strength, curl the weight using only your wrists  4. hold the weight

Go to the nurses office and ask soap, or possibly use a restroom in the office, they always have soap...    It's just like any other infection, keep your hands clean and out of your face... and other ppl should take care of themselves by not putting their dirty hands places... So it pretty much can't be helped in your kind of environment.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	The yeast candida is a natural resident on and in your body, including your digestive tract.

QXSFpMzDaa	It usually means a very bad cold, sinus infection, etc.  As long as you can keep fluids down and you aren't running a fever there really isn't need to see the doctor.  Just get plenty of vitamin C, rest and remember to constantly blow your nose to clear everything out!|`|f8mLpPXlaa	The different colors of "lugies" represent different etiologies of the broncitis. Green, dark yellow, brown, and combinations thereof indicate both the kind of bacteria  and the length of time it's been down there. Also viscosity is important.

If this is the last of the green monsters and you start feeling well, you may be on the true path of recovery. Make sure that you drink lots of fluid and stay warm.

QCTy1iaEaa	Most exercises won't do anything for the butt, you need to work very specific muscles. Squats are good, but there are far better exercises for butt. Also, you can have the strongest gluts in the world, but if they're hidden under a layer of fat (and cellulite), nobody will see them. So you need to get rid of fat too (which takes care of cellulite as well). Look for specific butt workouts, i.e. http://www.firmbuttexercises.com/workout... and others.|`|9Jnrhm8Yaa	Squat, squat, squat !   They're the best for firming your butt. If you add weights it's even more effective. Also lunges are pretty good. If you can add some cardio like stair stepping or running up hill that's even better.

This may also be the way to go if you do not hold a degree as one or more of the other programs mentioned requires a degree.

Pmb0MeB8aa	You will definitely gain fat with that diet. You are NOT eating enough. The amount you eat determines your metabolism. If you only eat 1100 calories per day, your body will slow down to 1100 calories per day. So then when you start eating 2000+ calories a day like you should be you will start putting on tons of weight in a bad way.    EAT TO LOSE WEIGHT. Just exercise.    About me: 2400 calorie diet, 60% carbs/20%fats/20% protein, 5'6" 150lbs/68kg, 11% body fat. I can't gain fat anymore because I eat, and I work out.|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	are you a carb freak? carbs turn into fat!|`|c059nXPfaa	That is an incredibly low amount of calories.  You should make sure you're getting enough nutrients.  You can calculate your BMR using the link below, and it will tell you how many calories you need daily to sustain your current weight.  To lose weight, intake less than that, but not a TON less.  I would advise no more than a 500 calorie difference. If you go that rate, you will lose 1 lb a week.  It takes 3500 cals to burn 1 lb of fat.|`|dq6E0qHOaa	nope just eat vegetables|`|R1xSSfVAaa	Difficult to tell. We will need more infor.

That is if that fat comes from junk.|`|70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	You're not eating enough. A man should eat approximately 2,500 calories a day. Women have to eat at least 1,200 calories a day to sustain her. You are eating way below what a woman eats. Try increasing your calories by 1,000, but still keep it healthy by eating fruits and veggies and lean sources of protein.|`|bakkLcSqaa	watch that sugar and fat intake! protein is always good but don't eat to much!|`|AA10824968	Well, that depends on your current size. If you are a small person, then they look great...if you exercise alot and weigh more than 175 then you need to add some more healthy calories to your diet.     Good luck!|`|L0OpEki8aa	Since you are a guy, you need more calories than that to function properly. With not enough you will lose muscle instead of fat. So the number on the scale will go down, but you won't really look great.
RsTm8uUlaa	This is what my team does 3-4 times a week:    We work primarily on our legs. Most of your strength comes from you legs. We run stairs, squats, run laps, jump rope, and run sprints. We start by running laps for ten minutes, we then run sprints for ten minutes, then we run stairs for ten minutes. Next, be take a water break and then play "the water" game. This is where the squats come in. You hold to glasses of water in each hand. You stand on the front of your feet. You squat at a 90 degree angle. Hold the two glasses in front of you. Hold for one minute. Each minute counts as one out. If you mess up, it's an error and you restart. You stand back up straight after ever minute. We play between 3-7 innings (9-21 minutes). Don't spill the water! Next we do pick-ups. You squat, stand up, shuffle to the left, squat, stand up, shuffle to the right, and squat. We do 100 of these. And lastly, we jump rope. We do 600 skips.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Exercise, especially the aerobic workouts.    Lots of stretching.    All good athletes have long, sinewy muscles, and are lean in build.
Yz1pzloSaa	I say keep your natural eye color. Green eyes are rare, and a lot of people who don't have green eyes get colored contacts that are green because they think it's a really nice, cool color of eyes to have. Plus, what if when you had your colored contacts in, someone said "You have really pretty eyes" ? You'd either have to tell them you have colored contacts in....or just ignore their compliment...?    I know that in my opinion at least, I'd rather have my natural eye color than walk around with a 'fake' eye color.|`|6yZ3Dunzaa	Acuvue.com has a photo upload to do a color contact makeover.|`|RNfygDqsaa	my friend had green eyes and changed them to blue. they looked fake and terrible.    idk if there is but try looking it up    -Best of luckk    =]  maddi|`|9xxCZBq2aa	it depends on your skin color and hair color. one of my filipino friends who has natural dark brown eyes. well, she decided to get bright blue contacts! the way it looked reminded me of a robot.

Pay attention to when it happens. Get a notebook and write down how you feel (headache,tired etc) every day, and when you have your period note it on the same pad then look at it after a few months. Even 1 month might be enough for you to see that it happens just before your period is due and gets better after.

wqeAeSVYaa	Spot reducing fat is a myth.  The only way to reduce your belly fat is to reduce your overall body fat.    The only way to do this is to run a caloric deficit. That means that your body has to burn more calories than you take in through eating and drinking.      The easiest way to move towards this goal is to eliminate garbage foods like those with refined sugar and those high in fat (fried).  You may also way to stay away from heavily processed foods such as those that come in a box, can or bag, including fast food.    If you increase your fiber intake through whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and balance it with a healthy amount of protein and good fats (such as from olive oil, avocados, fish), and up your exercise regimen to include some moderate weight resistance training in addition to cardio, you should be able to lose fat.    Keep a food / exercise diary so you know what's going in and out.  But do it wisely.  No crash dieting, no starvation, and no purging.  Weight loss done quickly is usually water weight and comes back with a vengeance.|`|8SRjELNBaa	There is no real specific foods to do that, just increase the intensity of your workouts and eat 400 fewer calories a day.  By the time summer comes around it should be tighter around there, ya know, less jiggly.

biFCKGAcaa	Inspite of whatever answers you may get here, I suggest you to take action consuming tea or not in due consultation with your doctor only. He is the best judge to assess and advice you correctly on the condtions prevailing with you.     Tea (Camellia sinensis), especially green tea, is high in antioxidants, which studies have shown may have a preventative effect against atherosclerosis. A 2003 study found that black tea may reduce the risk of a heart attack by as much as 43% and that black tea's protective effects are even greater in women than in men.    Nowadays, many people use green tea to lower blood pressure. It is not a secret yet. High blood pressure is so a common medical ailment all over the world. It lead to many disease such as heart disease, kidney failure and strokes. How does green tea control blood pressure? This article Green Tea And Blood Pressure uncovers the truth.     The Effect of Green Tea     green tea contains a substance named catechin. It inhibits the action of ACE. According to the flowchart above, the production of angiotensin II was suppressed. So green tea lower the blood pressure.     Besides, green tea and blood pressure study results was published in the September 13 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. It proved a significant reduction of death proportion from cardiovascular disease among drinkers of green tea. In the study they followed about 40,000 people for more than 11 years. They found people who drank more than 5 cups of green tea everyday had a risk mortality, relating to cardiovascular disease, that was 16% lower than people who drank less than 1 cup of green tea.     So it's very clear that drinking green tea is actually lower blood pressure. Hope this article green tea and blood pressure help you find a new method to control blood pressure. -|`|gMzGP7KWaa	I think you should be asking a doctor these questions based on what you say your illnesses are.

It can also depend on your age, when i was a teenager i had nose bleeds all the time, some of which i thought would never stop. Just be careful that if you are losing a lot of blood too frequently that you don't became anemic, if this happens take some vitiams with iron in. It might be a good idea to go to your doctors though just to make sure that it's nothing serious.

It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.|`|E2kx5kwjaa	I think it has some composition of fruit, should not have any side effects.    Even though there may not be any side effect, it is worthy to note Slimming pills and teas do not help to lose weight effectively in the long term. The use of slimming products may lead to rapid weight loss initially. By and large, many slimming products contain substances that suppress the appetite, stimulate metabolism or induce drastic water loss from the body.    It is not safe to use these products without adequate medical supervision. Moreover, slimming products are usually expensive and do not help change the overweight individual eating and exercise habits, which are the root causes of weight gain. This makes the maintenance of weight loss difficult.|`|Gx1CbI56aa	I've been using acai berry products for a couple of months now and I've noticed that yes they do work. I used them when I wanted to trim off about 15lbs.    I knew that diet and exercise alone would help achieve that goal alone but I needed something to help me with my mid afternoon snacking urges. This is where I found the acai berry really helped me.    It helped to curb those mid afternoon urges which meant when I went out jogging later that night I wasn't just jogging to work off that bag of Doritios I snacked on around 3pm instead I was actually working off the weight I wanted..    After a couple months I now no longer needed the supplements and can manage my weight more easily, so I found that yes they really did help speed up my weight loss goals when I used them along with a diet and exercise program, as the berries gave me more energy and helped to curb my appetite    I got my free trial bottle from the site below|`|76075de38faee453846c87739c1ee336aa	yes, i have.  i lost 7 lbs using the free trials on this page.  my friend lost like 5 lbs but she only took it for a week|`|ykCo6SDOaa	Acai can be very effective for some people but of course it is being over exploited as a magic-bullet|`|34Oa8sOdaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

AA11635143	Don't trust ONE word "faceless" has written.  He doesn't know what he is writing about and, in addition, he can't even spell.  I wonder why he wasted his time.    If you have had the lump for that long and it hasn't grown any larger or caused any pain, you probably don't have cancer.  It is most likely a hair follicle that is blocked.      Have it checked by a doctor for your own peace of mind.  In the meantime, don't worry about it.  We all have tiny oddities on our bodies; sometimes I think we were created that way to remind us that nobody is perfect.|`|FYeepQqeaa	I will try my best to help, I think you should definitely go to a well-man clinic or a gp because they've seen these problems before and they're not going to be prejudice in any way or form.

I don't have much knowledge as i'm female but it's sort of general answer, just go the gp, no one on here can give a explanation or cause because even if one of us was a doctor you would have to have an examination, so these websites are good for advice which is what i'm giving, hope helpful.x|`|x5tAxZR8aa	Here are the following Systoms of Testcular Cancer:    a lump in one testicle.    pain and tenderness in either testicle.    discharge or pus from the penis.    blood in the sperm at ejaculation.    a build-up of fluid inside the scrotum.    a heavy or dragging feeling in the groin or scrotum.    an increase in size of a testicle (one testicle is normally larger then the other but the size and shape should remain more or less the same).    There are two main types of testicular tumour - seminomas and non-seminomatous germ cell tumours (NSGCT, often also called 'teratomas'). The two types are about equally common. Seminomas are fairly smooth tumours and account for some 60 per cent of testicular tumours but teratomas are more complex and may contain different types of tissue.    Sounds to me it can be Testcular Cancer or a Sist on your testical but either way I'd get it checked out. Reason I say sist is Sist and painless and sometimes hard had one on the top of my ear once made me look like a elf lol.
UZxeBrxQaa	First off, testicular cancer is on, or in, the testicle!    A lump in the scrotum is not the same thing.  The skin surrounding the testicles has its own problems unrelated to cancer.    The smart thing to do is see a physician and get it treated for your own peace of mind.    Then relax and enjoy life with the remaining testicle you own.|`|hWc65sEtaa	Go get it looked at by a dr, they can treat that if it's early.
0uvgAKSZaa	you just have fast metabolism that's all.A lot of people wish they had that, your lucky. Im the same way, Ive almost been a skinny stick, so I can relate to you. Im 5'6 and weigh about 110-115. When I wouldl go to the doctors they would always take out blood and ask me a million questions because I was underweight for my height. But don't worry about it,if your eating good and are healthy theres nothing to worry about. :)|`|DksKPjHsaa	Hmm you may just have high metabolism, but maybe not, you should talk to your parents about it and see if they think you should go to the doctor.     ~CosplayNoobie~|`|1X3fvm16aa	Nothing is wrong with you. It sounds like you have a very high metabolism. A lot of people are built this way. Be careful of the foods you eat as unhealthy ones might catch up to you later in life. You should still be maintaining a healthy diet. If you want to gain wait in a healthy way you should look into taking protein shakes and supplements that body builders would use. Dont be concerned about bulking up as you are a female and do not carry the same hormones as men plus it doesnt sound like you lift weights anyway.     You say youre unlucky  Start thinking of it as LUCKY. Most of us women would love to be you!
PD1WpoEsaa	i promise you...hes bothered by it more than you!  he was nervous and couldnt perform, happens to  all at some point!|`|RXI8ImdIaa	It was probably the pressure, he was probably nervous. Yes this does happen even to a 20 year old.    It's not a big deal. The worst thing you can do is turn it into an issue. That directs more attention to the question of whether or not he is erect, and that will cause him to be NOT erect. It's largely mental, especially at a young age.|`|IVjspiStaa	go slow and easy... let it happen natural... no pressure... just cuddle and be with each other, when the time is right it will happen. let it be beautiful.

It is just a case I think of getting the act completed a couple of times and gaining confidence , There is no way it is your or his fault , and of course he is attracted to you .

3emS6MDmaa	anything you can lift can be used as weights, the problem is that it isn't very practical once you get to a certain level.  there are weights that you can buy that you fill with water, or you can use the jugs and add various things to them to increase the weight, water, rice, beans.|`|OaniQuqpaa	use what ever you want for weights, just make sure that you are not changing how you grip it if you were doing normal weights because that can effect what muscles are worked out.|`|mW39emMdaa	maybe|`|9y1uYUm3aa	yes it will work.|`|MOWFjKIjaa	yes it will work.

723QHuicaa	An enlarged left ventricle is usually due to either cardiomyopathy (a weakening of the heart muscle) or valvular heart disease. Valve disease is usually treated by correcting the underlying valve problem (initially with medicines, often later with surgery). The most common cause of an enlarged left ventricle is cardiomyopathy. Initial treatment is with medications, such as diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators (ACE inhibitors and/or ARB inhibitors), and beta blockers, such as carvedilol (Coreg) or metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL). In more severe cases special pacemakers or defibrillators are used. Only in the most difficult cases are heart transplants occasionally required.  http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/a...|`|DiPc84wQaa	umm i they might have been just referring to it, im not really sure but what i do know is that the left part of the heart is bigger than the right side as it has more muscles due to the fact the it needs to pump more blood to the body.     You should as the hospital what they meant by this and they will tell you for sure in better detail than my attempt of an answer !!     Hope this helps anyway :)|`|373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	I can't really help you as I am not a Doctor - although after some research it is actually quite common, and as long as the Doctors are aware you have no need to worry.    It's a weakening of the heart muscle, and you can be given Beta blockers and other things to prevent any damage.    You should call your hospital that discharged you and ask for a chat with the Doctor. If they are busy - your GP can call you back after surgery.    All I can say is, they would never have discharged you if it were serious, or any risk to your health. Try not to worry huni  xx    EDIT - Also, Doctors write in your notes what they SUSPECT, my notes mention Puliminary embolism, ectopic pregnancy, appendicitis and gall bladder stones, when I never had any of those things. They just wanted to rule them out.
c578fe0f7d75bfaf981ce7e4bab6c904aa	Hey im in exactly the same position as you. im sixteen and have all my important exams this year and i kind of eat to make myself feel better. im only just a healthy weight for my height and im starting a new school after summer so i want to lose a couple of stone. i had a minor operation on my foot last summer so i had to stop all the sport i was doing - which was quite a bit and i have found it hard to get started again. i have started running and i have improved even after just a couple of weeks but i guess you cant exercise much on your feet. so i guess swimming would be good. also just try toning exercises like sit ups each morning and night. but more importantly food. its much harder than it sounds! its unrealistic to ditch all nice food - just go easy on the chocolate and fatty foods. also a really good trick is stop eating when you are full!! drink water before and during meals to make you feel mroe  full and you wont eat so much - dont empty your plate if you are full. if you dont like fruuit eat more vegetables. and you dont need to eat salad to lose weight. try other things like jacket potatoes with tuna or stir fries. both substantial but healthy meals!! iv found a good way to cut down on the junk food is writing down all the bad things i ate at the end of the day. when i eat lots i always feel really bad and wont do the same the next day!! it works! the trick is do it slowly and not drastically as you wont be able to keep it up. just make small changes bit by bit. and be strong!!! let me know how you do and i hope it goes well. good luck! x|`|QwD44j01aa	Hiya. Best way is too eat healthy and exercise. Things like drinking smoothies and milkshakes instead of fizzy drink and lots of water. the vitamins and nutrients in these will also make you look healthier as they are great for your hair skin and teeth.  If your not big on salads like me incorporate different things into them, my favorite dish is salad (nicefresh lettice and watercress leaves) with croutons, hot chicken, and some fried noodles with ceaser sauce. I also add veggies like cucumber and beansprouts to it for more healthy vitamins.  As for exercise, its hard to fit it in with doing everything else like exams and so on but try fitting in a run just twice a week that lasts around 15-20 mins. Or when its cold wether keep the exercise inside like me :). Every other night i do 100 sit ups and leg and bum toning exercies (look on website and youtube for furthur info on them). These exercises are good because it means aswell as losing a bit of weight it is toning it up at the same time.  I think its important to treat yourself when you know your doing well with eating healthy.i have a small choclate bar or some biccies when im sat watching tv. Never starve yourself to drop weight because tis so unheathly. Its better to look after yourself and eat things you like and exercise along with that will make you feel great.  Hope that helps. Good Luck. X|`|ZZHFemQfaa	well you need to start some kind of fitness programme which im sure your brother could sort out. im afraid diet and exercise go hand in hand when it comes to weight loss! The best form of exercise for you in your current predicament would be swimming. You could swim for 20-30 minutes a day.    As for diet, try making a smoothie of fruits to suit your tastes. Vegetables are important, eat a lot of them, they are low in calories and high in fibre which means they fill you up without making you put on weight.  A few random tips:  - eat a high protein diet  - if your going to eat something bad,do it early in the day  - dont eat complex carbs such rice & pasta before you go to bed  - sleep more    Hope this helps

e9vcseLlaa	Ok thats a right shame for your mate.   Maybe you two should save some money and go to the shops and have a  few laughs. She may need a shoulder to cry on and someone to be there for her, someone to talk to. Maybe she needs to go cauncelling. My mate does. Just stick by her for as long as you can. Do something only she likes to do. And go with her at all times.   I hope she recovers, and i think shes lucky to have a mate like you! x|`|ztMeGHY0aa	If this is a mild case of depression I think positive thinking is needed here. As hard as it seems you should suggest to your friend to drop her thoughts every time a sad or hopeless one comes to mind and she notices it. If you notice her getting somber distract her. The trick is to notice it before it has taken  a hold. For her too. Then get her to look for something nice to look at or think of or a good catchy song to sing. Of course if it is depression where a chemical solution is needed that is different. Hope this helps both of you. Rent 'mama mia' if you haven't got it already!!
8SRjELNBaa	wow.. your really short.. meh, anyways. You have lost fat, but it's been replaced with muscle, like how you notice your legs have gotten. I'd recommend increasing the duration and intensity of your workouts. Other than that, it sounds like everything is in the right track. Instead of drinking a full serving of the yogurt before your workout, only drink half & put it back in the fridge.    If you can have time for two cardio workouts a day I would definitely recommend that once or twice a week.|`|goe3y4FPaa	work ur life around ur schedule for exercise... period..
DIRbVD5uaa	I was 5'2 an I weighted 145lbs  In 3.5 months I lost 32 lbs  Im not sure how much you can lose though  Slimfast shakes also have a weird after taste so dont go and buy two Boxes of them and then decide you dont like them.  Also, so your diet doesn't get boring I would suggest combining it with Special K diet. Its taster mixing the two givens you more snacking opportunity's.     Hope This Helped|`|COcN0nAjaa	It is a possibility to lose weight quickly but you should be realistic and take on board that if you lose weight quickly then you will without doubt put it all back on again just as quickly. The sole diet which really worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been reported in Fox News and CNN. I shed 25 pounds, it really does produce success!
00fSfCdFaa	You are very underweight. Your BMI is only 17. It's important for you to be a healthy weight, especially at your age as you are growing and need enough energy to develop your own curves and shape. You definitely must not diet ok? Try to get back to 116 if you can as that was a PERFECT weight for you. Try small steps at a time like eating an extra snack here and there and get used to eating a bit more.     Guys are attracted to all sorts of girls, big or small, fat or thin, and guys should never determine how you feel about yourself. You decide that. I get the impression you feel pretty bad about yourself, especially if you are hiding away under your clothes. The other girls may not be doing it right but neither are you hun. You need to chat to someone about how you're feeling about your weight and the other girls and stuff like that, rather than being trapped inside yourself you need to try and share your worries with other people so they can help you.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Contrary to popular belief, men like chubby women.  Advertising is what makes you think otherwise.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Fat chicks tend to have a lower self-esteem and no respect for them self, hence the tight outfits, thus making them "easy" for kids your age to prowl on and practice their flirtatious moves.    As long as you respect yourself, a down-to-earth boy who enjoys classier, self-respecting chicks will eventually approach you.|`|MOWFjKIjaa	well seeing that im a guy myself, i like girls who wear tight and preppy clothing. I definately wouldnt go after a girl that dresses all baggy and ghetto. also for some reason, the short girls are ALWAYS the good looking girls, never understood why... lol. and a chick having a bit of stomache fat doesnt mean anything.   personality also plays a big role. quite, shy, and unconfident girls never really get much attention to be honest, unless they look good...  hopefully this answered some of your unresolved questions.

qHMBkLx2aa	You definitely want to work your way up to increase your stamina. It's nice to start with a jog/walk combination before jumping right into running. The more you exercise, the longer you'll be able to run without losing breath. Remember to keep proper form and breathing techniques.    Follow the link below for a great running schedule that will have you running like a pro in no time!|`|8SRjELNBaa	Research proper running technique.|`|9Om1GN5Vaa	im rubbish at runnin as well because i get out ov breath too lol  i find that i am capable of running..  take some water.. and breath in and out through ur nose... then it dont make it soo hard to breath :)|`|YPNADV1Raa	Well you shoudln't puch yourself too hard, that's for sure. But one thing I've found is that if you start with walking, you won't see much difference. You already walk! It does't work out your lung muscles. What you want to do i sstart with a light jog, and go enough that you are breathing heavily, but not to the point of pain in the chest or anything. Start by going as long as you can at a consistant speed, and write down that time. Add 15 seconds to it each time. That way you will slowly build up your lungs to be strong and healthy.|`|SMGpf1jBaa	I just read an article in self a few months ago that said  the best way to improve your running is to do intervals every day. Same with weight loss.     You start out walking for 4 minutes at a brisk/intense pace. on a level of 1-10 start at a 4. This is  your warm up. then strart sprinting at a level 6 for 30 sec. to 1 minute. then brisk walk again for 90 seconds at level 5. then back to running at a level 7. keep alternating and each time work a little harder till you are running at a level 10. run at 10 for 30-60 sec. and cool off.     If you do this a few times a week, you will build stamina. then next week you can start increasing the time you run by 30 more seconds. You just have to train your body to know how hard it can work without failing, and how fast it can recover. Your breathing will get easier, and you will be able to run for longer periods of time.
gSo4dR7oaa	See a doctor to find out for sure if you have a UTI.  If you do, you MUST take antibiotics exactly as your doctor prescribes, until they are all.  The ONLY way to cure a UTI is to take antibiotics prescribed by a doctor.  Drinking water and cranberry juice may help prevent UTI in the future, but will NOT cure the infection you already have.  Untreated UTI can lead to kidney damage.  See a doctor!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	You are not getting much help here, are you?

However, it depends on your proportions...since youre not asking what the BMI says, it depends on whether all the fat is situated in the bottom/upper half of your body...or if it's mostly muscle! muscle weights more than fat :)|`|9y1uYUm3aa	id say lose 5-10 pounds|`|EJ0Fvm2Naa	I would have to say yes, if your asking this question im assuming that your thinking about working out or some type of exercise to cut weight...i would say 140lbs would be a more reasonable weight and then after you achieve that weight assess where you are and see if you want to go lower|`|MOWFjKIjaa	ehm, are u a chick or a guy.  If your a guy, do you workout at all? If so then no, ur fine.|`|VKDLSPFAaa	not really because you are really tall.    i would say to loose 10-15 pounds and you will look great!!  good luck!
uBkvqcY6aa	Don't do that... screw the supplements WORK OUT A LOT.  I had a lot of fat around the middle and the only way I could get rid of it was to make that part of my body work all the time.  I tried that Hydroxycrap and all it did was make my head swoon.  Work off the fat then, take an amino tab or some of the weight gain powder(as it does add calories/carbs) that can be worked into muscle.

Cold viruses get spread around by mucus and saliva flung out of the body by sneezes and coughs. Thus, if you really want to catch a cold, try standing downwind of someone who already has one.      * Touch everything and never wash your hands. While most cold germs are airborne, many get passed around on our hands. Thoroughly washing your hands or using hand sanitizers will remove many of the germs, but cold viruses can lurk anywhere hands have touched: door knobs, toilet flushers, telephones, bus or subway poles, and shopping cart handles. The machines at the gym and the buttons on the AT M, too. So touch everything - especially your nose!      * Stick your nose out. Temperatures drop and you bundle up in coats, scarves, and gloves, but your nose often gets left out in the cold. One catch-a-cold theory goes that when your nose is cold, you become less resistant to infection.      * Walk barefoot in the cold. Your grandma may have warned you about "catching your death of cold" if you dared go out outside with a wet head in wintertime. Well, it seems your grandma may be at least partly right. You see, many of us carry cold viruses around with us all the time, but we just don't always show the symptoms. Researchers at Cardiff University in Wales suggest that when the feet are cold, blood vessels in the nose constrict. This then makes it tough for your nose to fight off the virus and cold symptoms kick into high gear. So it seems like we just "caught" a cold, but it had been there waiting for a chill all the time.      * Hang out in the city. Cities are packed full of virus carriers - building ventilation systems, people walking or riding on buses and in cars, children going to and from school, and people crossing paths in hospitals, malls, and any number of other public gathering places.      * Stress out. Want a cold? Worry! Get anxious! It's thought that tension can make you less resistant to infection.      * Stop aging. With age comes wisdom, and this is true with your immune system, too. With every cold you battle, your immune system creates more and more antibodies and becomes smarter at handling new viruses that come along.      * Be human. No wonder it's called the common cold: Over two hundred different viruses float around and infect us humans every year, causing those familiar, unpleasant symptoms. Adults suffer an average of 2 to 5 colds each year, while kids experience 7 to 10 sniffle-and-sneeze episodes.|`|ZlVPMsWTaa	It's impossible. Depends on your health. If you've been running yourself ragged, your body will let you know that it's due for a rest.     Otherwise, suck it up and do what you got to do instead of faking a cold.
dr9y4tJsaa	Hemophilia is a sex-linked disorder that impairs the body's  ability to control blood clotting.  People born with hemophilia don't have the blood platelets to form clots to stop normal bleeding. There are two types of hemophilia hemophilia A and hemophilia B.  People with hemophilia A (9 out of 10 people with hemophilia have type A) have  no clotting factor and people with hemophilia B have low levels of the clotting factor. Hemophilia is genetic but you can develop it if your body forms antibodies that stop the blood clotting factors from working.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	Hemophilia is a genetic defect that affects how much clotting factor a person will have.  The less you have the more severe the hemophilia.  Fathers pass the defective gene on to their daughters, but not their sons.  Boys inherit it from their mothers.  A gilr must inherit it from both parents to have hemophilia.  1/3 of people with the disease have no family history of it.  It occurs spontaneously when a normal chromosome develops an abnormality.  It is detected in baby boys after being circumcised.  In rare cases prolonged bleeding occurs after the umbilical cord is cut.  People with hemophilia have bleeding into joints or muscles causing pain and swelling.  The also have abnormal bleeding after surgery, dental work or injury.  They bruise easily, have frequent nosebleeds, and can have blood in their urine. They can be given clotting factor replacement intravenously.  A person who has a mild case would only need replacement for surgery or dental work.|`|4CyXKudJaa	Hemophilia is a hereditary blood disorder where your blood doesn't clot normally. This is because your body has little to none of the protein which your body uses to clot your blood and can lead to internal bleeding. Basically you cannot heal or heal dangerously slow.  Hemophilia can be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how much clotting factor is in the blood.  Hemophilia can also develop over time. In addition to being inherited, hemophilia also can be acquired, which means that you can develop it during your lifetime.  I'm not sure but I think only boys can suffer from this blood disorder and women can carry the gene but don't suffer from it. I think both parents have to have it for you to suffer in any way at all, but for this I am not sure.    One of the most famous hemophiliacs was Russian Prince Tsarevitch Alexei, killed along with all his family during the Russian revolution in 1917. The disease had been passed to him by his mother, a daughter of Queen Victoria.    Heres where I got most of my information from:    http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Dise...|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Hemophilia is bleeders disease, meaning your body doesn't have the blood platelets to form clots to stop normal bleeding.  The Czar Nicholas' family was famous for having it, and was probably caused by the inbreeding of royalty in Europe for many generations.  They also bruise very badly and can hemorrhage internally.

Although it might mean you'll get weaker articulations later on, it is not indicative of arthritis in itself. Arthritis is an inflammatory disease, the popping is just caused by gas bubbles between tissues.
UZxeBrxQaa	There is no such thing as a diet pill that works.   ALL of them "suggest" a balanced diet and exercise, in addition to their pill.  They also indicate the results shown may not be the results you will experience.     The only pill that ever worked was a prescription, and it was for a stimulant that made you hyper-active, kept you awake, and was not good for you.  I cannot remember the name, I believe it may have been Benzedrine and Dexedrine.  While these worked, they were often abused and when you stopped taking them, your weight returned rapidly.    There's no miracle in diet.  You must balance calories intake, with calories burned.  If you eat more than you exercise, then the excess is stored as fat.    Suggestion, eat a normal balanced diet, just in smaller proportions.  After a few weeks your stomach will get used to the smaller amounts and you won't feel the need to eat more.  Slowly, your weight will come down, if you also exercise in moderation.

YtR2CB4oaa	Best way to study:  You need to take frequent breaks to allow for the information to consolidate.  Don't just re-read the material. Focus on practicing to retrieve the information like answering questions related to it.  Make sure you understand the material, not just memories it.  Making my acronyms for hard to remember lists of words helps you to remember them.  Look after your diet, avoid foods high in caffeine, sugar and saturated fats. Salmon is really good for your brain. Even just the tinned salmon.   For stress. Breathe in slowly for four seconds, hold that breath, breathe out slowly for four seconds and hold that for four seconds before taking another breath. Repeat no more than 6 times (cause otherwise you might feel light headed). This tells your brain to stop panicking as you are not in danger which will allow you to focus better. Very good just before the exam.|`|G9VBTg47aa	Stop going to "school"?|`|RJY6aRQ9aa	Oh, I remember those.

Get plenty of sleep and set aside a few hours a day of non-study time, for doing something that really makes you happy - you don't need meds.  Force yourself to have a clear head - a little nervousness keeps you sharp, but you can't afford to panic when you sit the exams...  Think about how much better off you are then people who aren't studying at all (yes, this helps...)  Most of all, do the best you can studying every day, so that on the day of the test you can think "This is the best prepared I can be, and whatever score I get will be what I fairly deserve for all the work I've done."  Knowing you've done your best preparing and not tried to cram is the best confidence-booster.  Good luck, and don't panic!|`|N27e2pzkaa	For me, running with an ipod in (chose a relaxing playlist, but not so much where you aren't motivated to run but not something that gets you high strung either)...

CBgDc1Auaa	eating healthy starts with knowledge... it is important to know how foods effect you, what benefits they have and how to get the most out of them...    for a very long time, the food pyramid has been a good guide as to what one should eat and in which amount.     I don't believe that it goes with everyone, because you can't just put everyone into the same group with the same needs...    for you, a growing body... it is important that you start proper eating trends early on.. this will make your future self much easier to eat appropriately through life...    skip the sausage buscuit... have a slim fast at home, it's way fast and it has essential viatimins and minerals, along with protien...    if it's a matter of getting hungary.. protien helps stave off hunger pangs for longer than carbs... Carbs are broken down much quicker into sugars in our body for quick energy.    you don't always have to eat like a health nut, but remember this simple rule..    always eat in moderation... eat to live, not live to eat.    and skip the juic too... it's loaded with sugar, you're better off drinking a water, and eating a fruit.    hope this helps|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Microwave a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, literally takes like 2 minutes.

Dinner, there are plenty of things to choose from.  -Most turkey and chicken in general, especially if it is skinless.  Turkey and chicken breasts especially.  Contrary to dumb internet rumors, going to the deli counter to have them slice up a roasted or smoked turkey breast for you is also fine.  -Ground turkey, chicken, beef or pork that is >90% lean  -Just about ANY fish  -Whole wheat bread, bagels, rolls, etc.  -Whole wheat pasta  -Brown rice  -Virtually all fruits and vegetables, including beans and dry-roasted nuts.  -Healthy fats like olive oil (for sauces, dressings & low-temperature cooking) and canola oil (for high-temperature cooking), and Omega-3 rich fishes.  -Low fat dairy products like skim milk, low fat/nonfat yogurt and reduced fat cheeses.  Just be aware that some reduced fat cheese are still relatively high in saturated fat.  Ways to cook your food:  -If it is a vegetable, eating it raw  -Steaming (especially) or boiling  -Baking, broiling, roasting without added fat  -Smoking and grilling  -Stir frying with vegetable oil|`|DgVlaoIjaa	I got lost in all your details.

EDXh0tk9aa	Even if you break it ahead of time, it does not mean that sex will be less painful and more pleasurable.  Your hymen may already be gone.  The vagina is a muscular tube and to date, you haven't used it so it's normal to possibly feel pain, uncomfortableness, etc.    My first time, I never bled but there was a whole lot of pain. So much we had to stop and try again a different day.  .  The hymen is the thin membrane that sometimes covers the opening to the vagina if you're a virgin. Even if you haven't had sex, the hymen can do a bit of a disappearing act due to an overzealous workout at the gym, horseback riding, tampons, and even passionate "heavy petting" with your boyfriend. (It's not an impenetrable barrier, anyway, as it has holes to allow menstrual blood to escape.)     For some, the first few times might make you feel sore, as the vagina has been an unused muscle or even hurt if you aren't properly lubricated, or if the guy is in a hurry, doesn't arouse you and your body isn't ready.     Relaxing, foreplay, (oral sex, more foreplay  touching, kissing, etc) being fully aroused or better yet, you having an orgasm FIRST or using a lubricant like KY-Jelly or Astro-Glide can help.    Hymens also look different:.  http://www.healthystrokes.com/hymengalle...|`|aIHSmRYwaa	Just fu c k!|`|tnEIPjccaa	The best way to prepare yourself for sex, if your hymen hasn't already been broken by using tampons, or riding a horse, or riding a bike, is to fidget with yourself during a hot bath. The heat from the water will make the stretching your fingers will slowly be doing more comfortable. But with an active lifestyle, it already might be stretched or broken. Mine was gone long before I lost my virginity, because I used tampons.|`|PjbAGtrEaa	I think that many women have their hymens broken by a boyfriend fingering them. Two of a man's fingers feel similar to a penis, and they stretch out the vagina walls to get it used to how a penis would feel.   You might have already broken your hymen by using tampons, getting fingered, etc. If it was during your period, you might not even realize it. I've talked to many people who said they didn't bleed during sex. It's not like there is gushing blood even if you do break it.     Try having your boyfriend gently finger you a couple times to get you used to the feeling before sex.|`|m5uzV6uqaa	Breaking your hymen won't make the pain go away. I suggest just try using your fingers first to 'stretch' the area a bit.
T4uZeVXjaa	Don't know if you are going to build muscle but you are going to get fat kidney failure, heart disease and constipation.    Those two cans of Dunn's alone are supplying 1000 calories, and enough protein and saturated fat for the day.  The ham sandwich and chicken just add more. That much protein and fat will cause kidney and heart disease.  The excess calories will make you fat.    Except for the porridge, you are eating no fiber.  That is bad for the colon.  You diet contains no fruit and no vegetables and not enough dairy.    Try this:  Add a piece of whole wheat toast with a glass of orange juice or some fruit for breakfast.    Have the ham sandwich on whole wheat bread with some carrot sticks or a salad, some fruit and a glass of milk.    For dinner, add another salad, at least one cup of cooked veggies.  Brown rice, baked potato, whole wheat pasta instead of rice.  Add fruit and a whole wheat roll.    Before workout have some whole wheat crackers with peanut butter or a granola bar or yogurt.  Or veggies and dip. Or a glass of milk.    After workout, the same again.    Do not drink any Dunn's River, it is just sugary, fatty expensive milk.

NXeyoFTNaa	To be honest unless you have a child who has been vaccine injured kindly be quiet. My son contracted Rubella ( german measles) from the MMR vaccine and now has Autism. thru chelation, hyperbaric therapies and 10's of thousands of dollars a year on biomedical interventions that are NOT covered by insurance....my son is recovering from Autism. He was poisoned.....period end of subject...as for the idiots in Washington...they will NEVER admit to wrong doing or the lawsuits would be HUGE!   Trust me on this one...we do not vaccinate our kids and if there is an outbreak we keep our kids home...we don't want them to catch the chicken pox...from the vaccinated kids. The amish don't vaccinate...where are all of the Autistic Amish kids?...answer...there aren't any. Denmark took Thimerisol ( mercury) out of the vaccines and the Autism rate has dramatically dropped.  However...food is a source for mercury as well...it is our toxic environment that has made our kids sick. High fructose corn syrup ( 30% of the samples taken had dangerous levels of mercury in it ) and the toys from china....hello? think about it. Some kids like my son do not have strong enough immune systems to help fight off the toxins.|`|pfm0wcEIaa	I really wouldn't listen to the med student because clearly she does not even know how to use google to find out that the are studies that show a relationship between immunizations and autism.    Most MDs think the solution is prescribing pills and shots for everything.  It would totally blow their mind if someone told them that NOT taking their pills might actually prevent an illness.    Many immunizations contain mercury that is why it causes autism in some children.  If you really feel the need immunize your kids, look into Homeopathic immunizations.  They are much safer and effective.|`|4CyXKudJaa	People used to think that there was a connection between autism and the MMR injection.. this was later proved wrong, there is no connection, although some people still worry...    Here are some articles.

There has been no study which has proven or even witnessed evidence of a scientific link between immunization and autism.  No scientist or doctor has been able to find a genetic or medical reason for the development of autism - it is one of the least understood disorders.      What has been proven is that choosing not to vaccinate children results in sickness and death much more often than the rare or mythical complications from vaccination itself.  There is no evidence, I repeat, that links autism and vaccination.  People who say that their child was normal, got vaccinated, and got autism are simply witnessing the onset of autism in their child UN-RELATED to the vaccination: autism can set in at any point in life, though it is most often diagnosed in 3 - 8 year-olds.      For articles related to this, search online medical journals through jstor or AMA.|`|K3TQT2rNaa	I have 2 siblings who are autistic and was very afraid of vaccination.  As a result I didn't vaccinate my son until about a year after it became obvious that he was in fact autistic.  Also, please do not do chelation, children die form that!  Autism is not the worst thing that could happen to your child, dying is!    Also, vaccinations including even trace amounts of mercury were discontinued in 1997.  So if you're talking about young children, no, there's no chance.  Polio is still in mexico people, how long do you think it will take to migrate up if we all stop vaccinating?  I'm sorry to those who weren't prepared for the life of parenting an autistic child, but this isn't the worst thing that could happen to you.|`|AA11538701	Many parents report that within hours of vaccination, the child started having a seizure, or running a high fever, sleeping for 10 hours straight, etc. And the dr's want you to think it's a coincidence. Please google "vaccine injuries" and you can find more info. Vaccines cause death. There have been kids die right there on the table. It is well documented and not denied by mainstream medicine. But, the dr's feel that if we lose a few kids, it's worth it...it's for the good of society as a whole. It's a liveable sacrifice for them. But God forbid someone find some salmonella in some peanut butter and grocery stores are ordered to yank them off the shelves. Doesn't seem right.    By the way, vaccines have been taken off the market in the past because of adverse side effects. No one likes to talk about this. Plenty of research about these old vaccines on the internet. Also, the AIDS virus originated from the Polio vaccine. They were using infected monkey parts and injecting them into humans. Just look on youtube or research otherwise.    By the way, chelation does not cause death....a DR'S ERROR cause those TWO deaths. They were prescribed the wrong thing! Good Lord people! Do you even know how many people have died from prescription medicines! But no one likes to talk about those! It's amazing that someone would bring up deaths from chelation and totally miss the deaths of thousands of children from vaccine injuries, which is what the original question was about!    Autism is caused by immune system failure. Vaccines rely totally on the immune system for effectiveness and should only be administered to kids with healthy immune systems, per the CDC. An immunity test would be very beneficial, but instead they are looking at adding even more vaccines. I'm very scared of this "God like image" that dr's and scientists now have. Sometimes I feel like taking my babies and moving to a remote island.    Do the research and please don't ever ever ever do multiple vaccinations in one visit...it's a recipe for immune system overload.    Best of luck :)|`|j2qXHlJgaa	Water, can you please send me some links to those articles...I am one that thinks that there could be a link between autism and vaccines.|`|8ryoShBpaa	I am too lazy to dig up my websites, but there are many that contain hundreds of studies.  Just go to the Yahoo Groups on autism and ask there.  They will refer you to more than you will have time to read.  My children no longer have autism, thus, I have researched a lot.  I think the bottom line is that the way most doctors are reversing it, has much to do with ridding the children of toxins, found in vaccines, and viruses given to us by vaccines, like in the MMR.  I judge the causes of autism by what it is being treated to rid it.  So, yes vaccines are a big contributor, but there are other contributions as well.  As much as the studies in the private sector show an increase in autism when vaccinated, one can still get it without vaccines, although there is less of a chance.  It appears that once the parents have been vaccinated, these pathogens and toxins from thier bodies can go into their sperm and egg via genes.  I seen studies on that, and that could explain things.  Word is that countries that have never been vaccinated, don't get autism.  I think that is another interesting point.  Don't expect the average medical practitioner to know any of this, but there are doctors within a decent driving distance of most everywhere, that do know.  You can go to www.generationrescue.org to find local people who know the local practioners in your area who are wise to causes and treatments for autism.|`|PlWZ6N6haa	PLEASE VISIT MY SITE WWW.TOGETHERINAUTISM.ORG
jfQdypeMaa	Be careful!  500 cal's per day is not enough to support normal body function and requirements!  I am trying to figure out why you would not have been noticing weight loss with all the working out you were doing while only eating 1200 cal's per day, but you have to realize that if you are working our fairly strenuously like that, your body is converting fatty tissue to muscle tissue - and muscle tissue weighs more.  So while you may have not noticed much of a decrease in your total body weight, I would bet you were able to notice a decrease in muscle tone and even your measurements!    The best advice anyone could give you would be to continue with the 1200 cal's per day, and be patient.  I commend you for your eager work at getting yourself into better shape, but be patient with yourself.  Cut yourself some slack!  This getting into and staying in shape should be a long-range goal and committment.  Trust me, it will pay off greatly for you.  Just set your goals a little further down the road.  You didn't mention how long you had been at this, but I am guessing that maybe you have just begun with this program in the last few weeks.  Stick to it!

WauRLOovaa	hi sweetie (very appropriate, don't you think HAHA)  I am type 1 (24 yrs) on a pump (8 yrs) and have to increase my basal to 180% a few days before my monthly company. I increase my basal for colds, too. It is just my normal pattern - nearly doubled so my morning peaks and evening lows are covered appropriately.  Don't forget to change everything first - when you get two or three highs in a row, just change your cartridge of insu and also your line and cannula, in case your insulin is 'off' or your line is (partially) blocked or your cannula is in a bad absorption spot.  Just start a fresh. Also, with three highs, you should be taking an extra 'emergency' bolus using a PEN so you are sure you are getting some actual insulin IN. You MUST check every two or three hours because then you can see your pattern (a line of bloodsugars in a row indicating if you are going up or down and where you will likely end up eg going from 22 to 5 in one hour is likely to get you hypo in the next ten minutes.... (sorry I do mmol/l you do mg/dl) so this is too steep of a decline and you need to have a much more gradual decline to keep more level (less up/down jojo effects).    Gosh it is such a vast topic isn't it, I could talk about it for hours.    I have not checked out the meds you take at all but some meds have an insulin resistancy effect so beware.    Don't be afraid to experience with an increased basal rate or doubling your boluses for a few days, but be CERTAIN you check your blood glucose levels ever two to three hours and plot your graph (put glucose levels on a grid and draw lines between the dots: a level line is good, a downwards line indicates a hypo-in-the-making and an upgoing line means you need more insulin to keep more level). Also, have some fast acting sugars available to eat (muesli bars / glucose tablets / tea with lots of sugar / piece of toast with lots of jam etc.    And good luck! It is nice to know you are trying to make pumping work!|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I usually only have high BG's with a cold on the days I'm running a fever.  Your body is fighting and releasing lots of hormones that throw off your BG's.  You'll need to check more often and give yourself correction doses of insulin to help bring it down.  Have you checked your ketones?  That's another sign your body is fighting, and it makes you more insulin resistant.  So if you'd normally give yourself 1 unit for every 70 points you're high, you might need to give yourself 2 or even 3 units.  Try to keep yourself under 220 and don't try to be too aggressive.  The meds you're taking shouldn't have much effect, but if you take cough syrup, the normal stuff is 19g/2 tbsp, and the sugar-free stuff is about 10g/2 tbsp, so give yourself insulin for that.|`|OtU6z4OFaa	It's probably just your cold, but make sure you have sugar free medicine.

RvPuRmqAaa	To train for strength and increase in size (hypertrophy) try 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps every other day. Do not train the same muscle group on consecutive days as this could lead to over training or injury. More on over training here http://www.gain-weight-muscle-fast.com/a...    There are several variations of the biceps exercise:     - hammer curl   - traditional   - preacher   - concentration     They are all demonstrated here http://exercise.about.com/cs/weightlifti... with instructions, including pictures.      You can opt to use different types of equipment, including a barbell, dumbbells, incline bench, exercise ball, or bands. This way you can change it up and never get bored.    Generally, anything beyond 12 reps in a set is getting into endurance training.    Hope you get the results you want!|`|9YwDsgN7aa	Crunches!|`|AA10563860	weights-bicep curls.    you may also need some treats for positive re-enforcement.|`|947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	first, don't over train them or they won't get bigger. One exercise in particular I like is the preacher curl with close grip (hands about 3-4 inches apart). Aim for three sets 10-12 reps, but when u finish your last set, put bar down and rest for 10 seconds, then do another rep or two if u can, rest 10 seconds again, they try to do another rep or two - so do this rest/pause 2-3 times after you finish...your bi's will get smoked.
OMHKp1nhaa	Well I went on the DHHS (department of health and human services) website on body mass index, I entered your information and I am glad to say you are 3 bmi's into normal weight. This could be verified if you want by searching "BMI Calculator" on the web. You could shed a bit more weight to make you considered, "fit". And I would suggest this for your long-term health. Good luck and I hope I helped.

Nyzb6cLraa	I would go to her parents and let them know. If you really care about her and she knows that, it will be ok. I'm sure she would be upset at first but that is not a healthy weight, even for her height, and she obviously needs some help learning how to take care of herself. It's one thing to be obsessed with calories or sound obsessed (a lot of people sound like they are but do nothing to actually lose weight or consume fewer calories) its another to act on those obsessions. It takes a lot of time and support for someone to truly come out of the eating disorder mindset. It just sounds like she needs help and encouragement from people who care about her to get to going in the right direction.|`|cfvAJJqdaa	Who cares?    It's her problem to deal with. She will have a hard enough time fixing her own problem without you trying to help, there's nothing you can do.  My advice is to not give her the attention she is seeking and ignore it.    That in itself doesn't mean she has an eating disorder.    People on regular diets would say the same sort of thing.

4f83266baf568ce96cc65c2ccc061993aa	Eat alot of fish to keep your body mass or lean protein. Eat a little bit less carbs everyday kinda like a one day less the next normal. And then the 2 days with low carbs. Stay away from white stuff, bread, white rice, plain pasta. Go green, lots of it. Count your calories and make sure they are pure.    Make sure you have alot of water. 1.5 litres of water    Use the eliptical and then if thats not enough use the bike.    I would say High reps for a least 3 sets and then one low. I think the ideal is never let the body get use to your workout. Throw a curve ball once in a while. Do 2 sessions of high reps and then just do one session of mid to very low reps.    And another thing have fun Man try something different.|`|b8IA5ly7aa	if you only run a mile a night its gonna take a realllllllll long time to lose 10 pounds

Those plastic flossers help because they make it more convenient and it does feel really good to have all that crud out of your teeth and you don't have to dread wrapping the string floss around your fingers. You will be surprised how much that helps.      Also, brush your teeth at least twice a day, morning and night, and maybe once during the day as well as using mouthwash regularly. It's not free but it doesn't cost a fortune either. After a couple of days you will be surprised how much that does for getting rid of bad breath.     I would also cut down on sweets and carbonated beverages. That can affect the bacteria growth in your mouth as well as cause tooth decay.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	Let me share my personal experience.  My wife quit kissing me but would not tell me why until I pressed her.  She said,"You have bad breath".  I was really hurt because I could not smell my own bad breath.

I found a great tongue cleaner, OraBrush, and with a mouthwash I now clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  Now I get a kiss from my wife because I have fresh breath.  The tongue cleaner only cost a few dollars and lasts for many months.  A very inexpensive way to cure bad breath.|`|I6pmPb1Baa	make sure you are brushing your teeth after every meal for two minutes.  use a tongue scraper to get the stinky germs off.  rinse with BreathRx, it keeps your breath nice all day.  drinking water helps.      for extra backup chew some gum with natural bad breath killing ingredients.|`|ReH5EoR0aa	Keep your mouth clean, floss your teeth, keep a healthy diet.

9amvSTtzaa	Make sure your diet is in order.    Diet tips    1) Eat 5 to 6 meals per day, spaced out every 3 to 4 hours.    2) Ensure that you eat adequate amount of protein. A good rule of thumb is to consume 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, e.g if you weigh 170 pounds, that means you have to eat approx 170 grams of protein per day.    3)  Your body will be deprived of food for at least 8 hours thus you must consume slow digesting protein like cottage cheese or skim milk + whey before you doze off. This keeps muscle loss at bare minimum.     http://www.absopositively.info/diet-to-g...    Workout tips:    1) Select bread and butter routines like the bench press, squats, deadlifts, overhead press rows, etc. When it comes to packing on muscle mass in minimum time, these compound exercises can't be beat.    http://www.absopositively.info/how-to-pl...    2) Make slight improvement to your workout every week. Add a little weight or perform an extra rep or two every week. Gradual improvement on a weekly basis is vital to your success.    General tips    1) Be patient and remain consistent. It'll take anywhere from 2 to 6 months to make noticeable gains. Years if you want to have that bodybuilder look.    2) Get a step by step program to cut your learning curve short|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.    The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator http://calorieneedscalculator.com  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.    Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles.     When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.    You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...|`|rEZ2QGa0aa	eat well, lots of protein.    also work on the muscles that you want to add mass to most, then work on the others.

ubkBeUh2aa	First of all you are not eating ENOUGH calories. If you do not eat the right amount of calories while you are on a workout program, then your body will start to store fat versus releasing it for it to be burned.     This is why you are seeing the weight gain. Find out what your healthy range for a daily calorie intake should be and stick to it. For guys it ranges from 1800-2100 dependent on current weight and height. Guys retain more muscles mass than women , so remember that as you workout , its natural to gain back muscle weight - but this should never be over 3-4 lbs per 6 week intensity workout.

The whole process is not as bad as one would think!   I was really scared when I got mine out, only because my best friend had hers removed a week before and she had hemorrhaged.  You should have your doctor tell you about hemorrhaging, its rare, but can happen.  During the procedure you are a sleep, the last thing I remembered is counting backwards from 100.  You wake up in the recovery room, your throat is a little bit sore and its hard to talk.  You then have to wait at the hospital in recovery for 6 hours..  If anything its really boring.  Make sure people come to visit and that you have lots of reading material.  Your medicine wears off after a few hours, but the nurse gives you more.    When you go home, you can really eat too much.

Anything low in fat, sat fat, sodium, whole grain foods. If you run, carbs are good just dont overdo them. Focus on snacking all day, about 6 small meals a day. You will never get hungry and will not over eat. 20 min of cardio is all you need 3-7 days a week, but as you get more fit you may want to increase this amount to 30-40 mins.

Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn).     Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out http://calorieneedscalculator.com The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.    Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - http://straightdiet.com

Starting your day off with a healthy breakfast will kick-start your metabolism for the day. If you are going to eat more calories you need to stay active so your body will burn those calories. If you dont burn them you will store them...as fat.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Losing weight is all about a good balance.     You don't want to starve yourself because a) It's flat out unhealthy and dangerous b) It triggers your body to enter a starvation mode and drastically lowers your metabolism(This is only normal, and allows the human specie to adapt to many environments).    On the other hand, you don't want to be eating a ton of calories either. As you stated, this defeats the purpose of losing weight. What you WANT to do is eat small healthy meals frequently, so that your body's metabolism keeps rolling. By incorporating some exercise, you will be burning more calories than calories you consume, all while having a fast metabolism.     A "fasting" diet can give you great "band aid" weight loss. It's not a long term diet, for obvious reasons.|`|3CCIcS6Oaa	The key is to eat at least every 2-3 hours and burn more calories than you consume.  If you don't eat often, your metabolism will slow down, which defeats the purpose of everything you are doing.    The average person should consume 2,000 calories a day (about 2,300 for men), so if you drop it down to 1,800/2,000 calories a day and exercise to burn about 300 calories, you will lose fat.    I do NOT reccommend fasting, it may work for a short period of time, but as soon as you start eating again, your body will suck all that to your fat storage because your body thinks (and is) its starving.|`|067fa6dfc93e782fff815f1abe45eebaaa	You will get fat if you fast...because you can't fast forever, and when you do, your body will grab on all of it.    The 2nd one is true. But you have to make sure your not over going on your calories.|`|NMr99XYfaa	I had surgery and I couldn't eat for two weeks. I lost 25 pounds, but when I started back to eating, my body took all that food and stored it as fat. So it's better to eat small healthy meals every couple hours and just exercise.|`|8rMgQv15aa	Well, first lets look at the obvious. If you absolutely don't eat anything but saltines and water then obviously you are going to lose weight because if you starve yourself your body starts pulling nutrients from stored fat cells. On the other hand if you starve yourself you have absolutely no energy and feel run down all day long and can do nothing but sit around and waste away.     Now for  2. If you eat A LOT then obviously you are going to gain weight (especially if you eat all the wrong things) but that all depends on what you are eating. If you eat about 5 small meals a day with nutritious foods and work out for about an hour or 2 a day then you will definitely start to see weight loss because with a good diet and exercise your metabolism will sky rocket, and your energy levels will soar. You would think that after you got done with your workout you would be drained and ready for bed, but in reality if you eat right and workout regularly you would actually be ready to do some more stuff after your workout such as yard work or clean the house maybe. This is why a lot of people like to work out in the mornings because it gets their blood pumping and juices flowing a lot better before they head off to work.     So in conclusion, it is possible for all 4 of the scenarios you asked about to happen. And obviously you would not want to starve yourself because that's just a way to make you sick. Your body needs nutrients to function. With the proper amount of nutrients and a good exercise routine you can't go wrong!     ps. By eating 5 small meals a day you decrease the feeling of being very hungry, therefore you are able to eat plenty and still maintain a good workout by not stuffing yourself.     pps. Starving yourself is never the answer. It increases your risk for getting a cold or worse, because your immune system shuts down to save your body energy. In fact, you will find yourself getting a cold a lot less if you start eating and exercising right. I personally used to get sick all the time before I started working out. Now I only get about 2 colds a year at the most! I love it.     I hope that helps out! If you have any more questions let me know! I'd be glad to help!|`|hNShT9yhaa	1st is a lie the second guy is right right when you decide to eat your body turns it all into fat instead of getting the nutrients. ALTHOUGH everyone once in a while ( once or twice a year. ) it's healthy to fast for one day. I know it sounds absurd but by only drinking juices water and milk fasting for one day can help filter the body out. BUT like I said once a year.
BHacM0GTaa	I know having a busy life can interfere with working out, but you should really try to get some exercise or activity during the week.  You will feel better and lose weight faster.  As for diet pills, I recently starting taking a newer diet pill that I heard about in one of my magazines called, "The Fill Pill". Its a diet pill with some sort of fiber, appetite suppressant similar to Hoodia, and vitamins. The combination of the three is supposed to help reduce hunger and trigger fullness sooner when eating. I have been taking it for a few months now and have lost about 20 pounds. I wouldn't say that I feel full when I take them, but it seems to take an edge off the hunger. If i take it about 30 minutes before a meal, I have noticed that I am not able to eat even half of what I used to be able to eat, and felt full for a lot longer.    Hope this helps!|`|OBwqjS8maa	I've tried quite a few and none have worked, but I heard about this new pill that's a little slower to work but is effective every time if used properly...good old fashioned diet and exercise. ;)|`|N4JnxYzjaa	I know how difficult it is to find a diet pill which work in the market today because of lots weight loss supplements out there. Anyway you are looking for best as well as safe diet pill to lose your weight? Then it is better to try a fat binder which works great for me and it our the counter and 100% natural. There is no known side effect from this pill. The name of the fat binder is Proactol. One more thing i want to tell you is don't go for fat burner pills as these pill don't work at all. Fat binder and fat burner both are different diet pill so don't get confused here. If you want to get more knowledge on Proactol diet pill which is natural and clinically proven then visit http://loseweightfastpro.com/category/pr...
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.    When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat.     The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...

Vv4rWKJmaa	Huntington's is autosomal and dominant. if you have huntington's, your kids have a 50/50 chance of inheriting it. Below, the link shows a family tree illustrating it. It seems dominant in both genders.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Autoso...    SIckle Cell Anemia is not sex linked, [autosomal/recessive].  Females are more likely to survive having it.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	No the chances are the same for both sexes. The chances differ only when the defective genes are located on the sex chromosomes (such as for hemophilia). These two mutations are not located on the sex chromosomes, so all kids get one copy of each gene from both parents, so the chances are equal. If you did have a difference of incidence between males and females, it could be because the faulty gene is located strictly on the Y chromosome, so only males ( or XXY females ) would be affected or because it is a recessive disorder found only on the X chromosome then only females would be affected (because you would need two copies of this chromosome whereas normal males only ever have one)

fwpu4jL3aa	You can lose a lot of weight just by changing the way that you eat.   One of the easiest ways to lose weight is to eat less food but more often. The way I do this is to divide my daily calorie maximum by six. Heres an example.    Lets say that I want to lose weight by eating only 1200 calories per day. Instead of eating 3 meals a day of 400 calories each, Im going to do it differently.

vIw47BEFaa	I presume you are talking about respiration control centers.    1.  It is the most protected area of human body.  2.  Breathing represents the beginning and the end. i.e. the life and the death, its final control is in the head and the brain, and in particular the cerebellum.    Spiritually speaking:    3. Life and death are controlled by God in heaven or in the macrocosm.  4. Life and death in human body(microcosm) are controlled by the God's replica in human body which is Soul and is prevalent in the human body all over and with this nucleus in the head in the form of Element Ether and therefore closest to the commanding centre, being the most vital functions.    5. Would suggest that the controlling mechanism for all metaphysical aspects has its abode in the Sahasrara Chakra. Breathing process has apart from the inspiration expiration process has the Earth element functioning as lungs, the air element responsible for expansion and contraction of the lungs, whereas the factor of giving heat to the body is that of element fire and that of giving life to the body is the attribute of element Ether.  Through the Shadadharas(Chakras) or the energy centres, these are constantly communicated by the body to the Hqrs of Ether located at the head, which are not visible aspects.  All attributes of Ether are invisible.  And therefore, all those have to be founded in the head rather than the body where ether by nature is primarily concentrated.           the first two explanations may be construed as the sthula (physical) visible macro level explanations.

All he had was water.    Blaine began his 44-day endurance stunt sealed inside a transparent Plexiglas case suspended 30 feet (9 m) in the air next to Potters Fields Park on the south bank of the River Thames, the area between City Hall and Tower Bridge in London. The case, measuring 3 ft (0.91 m) by 7 ft (2.1 m) by 7 ft (2.1 m), had a webcam installed so that viewers could observe his progress. During the 44 day period, Blaine went without any food or nutrients and survived on just 4.5 liters of water per day.    Stupid really, He needed treatment in hospital afterwards due to his heartbeat becoming irregular and the walls of his heart becoming thin due to lack of potassium.He also lost 4 stones in weight.    Something that stupid can only serve to put you at greater risk from disease as you are starving your body of vital nutrients it needs in order to protect you.
aiBOMU9kaa	No one can tell if you are a good candidate for laser surgery just by the prescription you wear.    You will have to be evaluated by the ophthalmologist at a laser clinic to see if you meet all the criteria. Most clinics offer a free consultation.    Not everyone is a good candidate for it, for different reasons.

The Samurai used to say something like, any decision should be made within 3 breaths.  If you REALLY can't do that, then you don't have enough information, and shouldn't worry about the problem until you do have.    Meditation (not the kind with distractions like music) also really helps with anxiety and all that.    Foot advice:    If you have time, go see a doctor and borrow a crutch until a full exam later.  Otherwise, have someone lend you a shoulder for support to get to/from the exam.

Xr5bU3t1aa	It's possible, however, regardless of what it is, I would strongly suggest you get some counseling.  You've had a lot to deal with in your life, and you need some help now.  Things can and will get better for you....but you need to take control of your own life, and ask for help.  Best of luck to you !!|`|QWaspeg7aa	I think what this person at work has done has clearly stirred up memories that you've either laid to rest or buried. I think you should take the way you felt as a sign that you need to deal with these memories and get some therapy because your childhood clearly (and naturally) is upsetting you. You may get a diagnosis of PTSD but what it is is almost irrelevant- the point is that you need to get this dealt with. Good luck.|`|vgpuTBmSaa	yep. welcome to the club...you are a certified  LIFETIME member|`|NgnbtaORaa	Yes, it sounds to me like it is post traumatic stress disorder.  A friend of mine suffered from post traumatic stress when he was assaulted on the street.  Their PTSD got so bad that that they developed a phobia of leaving their own house and a fear of people.  However, they sought out cognitive behavioral counseling and are fine now.  Counseling, in my opinion, is better than meds for disorders as with meds you will become dependent on taking them to relieve your anxiety.  I would talk to your GP or dr to see if it is a good idea to start counseling sessions rather than remain on your meds.|`|q1puEiJdaa	I don't think you could say it was post traumatic stress disorder. However you are obviously suffering from a stress disorder caused by your treatment by your mother. This is what you need to address, as this is the root of your problems. Ask to be referred by your GP to a psychologist or look for a counselling service.    With regard to the incident at work you could report this incident to human resources as no one has the right to bully you in the work place. However beware the term bullying as you do need to decide whether you deserved the bawling out, or whether you are being over sensitive because of your past history.|`|TdNVIKEtaa	First of all, I'm sorry to hear about your childhood, it must have been so hard.

Z2m8TEFHaa	Firstly, I would recommend not making sweeping statements about all doctors being rubbish. We're damn lucky to have people who have spent their lives training to be able to make sure that we can live healthily, so show a little gratitude.    Secondly, I would recommend that you stop whining and either a; Do what the doctor told you to do and exercise or b; Go back to the doctor again and tell her that it's getting worse if it's really that bad.

9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Only for certain types of heart disease- I am also not sure who this screening is available to and what the criteria is. A gene has been identified which leads to high cholesterol (which could cause Coronary heart disease) and an increased risk of heart attacks.    The procedure detects a disease called familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), it will also identifies a milder form that can be controlled by drugs and diet.    In the UK, the licence was given last year to test embryos for FH at the University College Hospital in London. There are two types of FH. Heterozygous FH, which affects 1 in 500 people is caused by a single mutated gene, which raises cholesterol- increasing the risk of hardened arteries, heart disease and stroke. It can usually be managed with statin drugs and diet. The above testing may not help in your case. Have a chat with your GP again,- any other specific testing I am not sure about.    Edit  Hi. Embryo screening will not be able to detect whether or not someone is going to suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or any cardiac arrhythmia or risk of stroke for that matter. The only thing I can suggest is that if the Drs are aware of the family history, they can monitor any new addition to the family with appropriate tests and if indicated provide prophylactic treatment if needed.    You could also ask your GP if genetic counselling may be of benefit to you.|`|mG2lZRrXaa	Embryonic screening can only detect diseases in which one gene or chromosomal aberration is responsible. That is not the case here.
AA10299265	It might be if you're not getting enough essential vitamins and other nutrients from raw fruits and vegetables.|`|aFK7yD4xaa	No. It's not normal.    For a start, I would recommend that you go out and buy a good one a day multivitamin and mineral combination (gluten free) plus some fish oil capsules and start taking them every day.    Then you need to look at your diet in the round. Does it have a good level of carbohydrates (these are your main energy source)? Remember, you can get carbs from rice, corn, potatoes, peas, beans and various other places, including other gluten-free grains. And of course, sugar is pretty much pure carbohydrate, though I don't recommend adding huge quantities to your diet.    Also make sure you are eating a good quantity of fruit and/or vegetables - preferably fresh - (excluding potatoes). You should get at least 5 portions of these a day. Juicing them is fine. Also add some nuts - NOT peanuts, but brazils, walnuts, cashews, pecans...    Finally, you need at least 4-5 oz of protein (meat, fish, cheese, eggs) a day and some fat or oil - because some of our essential nutrients can't be found except in fats and oils. Butter is better for you than most margarines (it has recently been discovered), because most margarines contain trans-fats and butter doesn't. If you are using it in cooking, butter, olive oil and grapeseed oil are the safest, as they don't turn to trans fats when you heat them up.    If you have little or no energy, I guess you have reduced the amount of exercise you are doing, or eliminated it entirely. This is a bit like keeping a horse in the stable for a few weeks before a race, so as not to tire it out. When he finally gets loose, he won't have the stamina to complete a race at all.     Instead, what you need to do is to go along to your local gym and make an appointment with a trainer. When you meet him/her explain your situation and ask for a graded series of exercises to help you get back to fitness. Then follow them.|`|0494d957cdc898138da2648f6185a57eaa	Yes it is normal not to have much energy,i've been on a glutten free diet for over one year and have lost 40lbs.I have Celiac disease and  It's diffecult to eat properly but you have to do the best you can sign up for the celiac newsletter for starters|`|UXI8bWWOaa	My sister was eating almost constantly after she was diagnosed.

f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	I'm so sorry about your son.  Depending on the type of leukemia, he might have a fighting chance of survival.    My own son battled and won his own fight with lymphoma.  He has been 3 years clear now and I hope and pray it always remains that way.    It's extremely difficult on other kids, but the best policy is honesty.  You don't want to scare them, but they have to know that cancer can indeed take a life, but your son is getting the best possible care he can and that you all have to be strong and stay positive for his sake and if you are a religious person pray, and ask everyone around you to pray.  I believe in the power of prayer and know it saved our family.    If your son should worsen, your kids will suspect that he quite possibly might not make it, and they need to know that too.  It can't come as a complete and total shock. I don't believe that is right, even though they are young they need to know so they can start processing that information.    Dont focus on the negative however, focus on keeping your family strong, use your love to do that, enjoy your time and keep it positive and laugh a lot, for all your sakes.    If you go to www.caringbridge.org and start a page, you will run into many people who will help and support you there.  It's really a life-saver to many families.    I'm sure there are many who can help you who have been through similar circumstances and if nothing else you will find the inspiration from the courage and strength that these children and families go through.     Good luck and I hope your son will get through this. You will see just how many children combat this horrible disease on that website. It's really unbelievable and we must work towards finding more cures and improving survival outcomes for these children.    Just FYI, I didn't find comfort in people who had no idea what we were going through. I know they meant well but most times they just got on my nerves saying things like "even if he has to lose his leg it's okay because he'll survive.    NO, it's NOT okay.    I found camps for people and kids with cancer, being with families who were going through what we were going through and volunteers who took the kids and did stuff with them, THIS helped us through.  This was our comfort.    So if you can't find that go to that site. I'm sure you will learn a lot and maybe discover what help there is in your area or just find other families around you.  Dont be surprised to find there are so many too.    Explain to your kids what leukemia is, that the medicine to kill the bad cells also hurts the good ones and that makes your son so sick.  Tell them the hope is that if the chemo can get rid of all the bad cells your son might be okay but leukemia is a very bad disease and nobody knows for sure if that's going to happen.    Make sure you keep a sterile environment too in your house, everyone Purell  - no one go near your son when they are sick.  His immune system will be low to zero and he may not be able to fight off a virus and get pneumonia and pass away from complications (if he is really, really sick...my son was at camp when he hit that point and I was TERRIFIED but his levels went up and he got through it without a hitch).    You didn't say what type of leukemia.  Some are worse than others but there are survivors so stay positive.|`|AA12302228	hi,sorry to hear that, i dont think you could fully explain to children as young as 3 and 6, but you could say their brother is really poorly. as for the first answer well, the least said the better. well i hope every thing works out for the better,for you and your family. im not a religous person really, but i"ll say a prayer for you all. best wishes..james.f|`|8UQ7GupHaa	Give him 3 or 4 Apricot seeds aday , and watch him get well !!!         http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eO0I2jWth...|`|AA12266052	The goal of treatment is to get the blood counts and the bone marrow to normal. If this occurs, the cancer is considered to be in remission.  If you have acute lymphocytic leukemia, you'll need chemotherapy. For the first round of chemotherapy, you may need to go to the hospital for 3 - 6 weeks, but may later get chemotherapy on an outpatient basis. If you have a low white blood cell count, you may need to be placed in a room by yourself so you do not catch an infection.  Additional treatments depend on other symptoms. They may include:      * Transfusion of blood products, such as platelets or special red blood cells, to fight anemia      * Antibiotics to fight infection  If you go into remission, you may receive additional chemotherapy or radiation therapy to kill any cancer cells that are in the spinal fluid. You may also receive chemotherapy from time to time to prevent relapse.  If your leukemia returns or does not respond to other treatments, your doctor may recommend a bone marrow transplant after high-dose chemotherapy.  High-risk patients may need bone marrow or stem cell transplants  Patients can ease the stress of their illness by joining a support group where members share common experiences and problems.  Children usually have a better outcome than adults. The majority of adults go into complete remission. Without treatment, a person with ALL can expect to live for about 3 months.|`|TZiySTOGaa	first of all i would like to say how sorry i am that your little one is so ill, it isnt fair for anyone to have a disease like this, let alone a child, i wish him a speedy and full recovery...    secondly, all you can do is try to explain that he isnt very well, be simplistic with your explanation, try saying something like everyone has lots and lots of cells in their body's and sometimes some of those cells get poorly and thats what has happened to his cells, if they ask if he is going to get better be honest and say you dont know at the moment but everyone is hoping that he will and thats all you can do at the moment. make time to play with the other 2 and try to do some activities like playing cards or drawing some pictures and things that arent too energy consuming for your poorly child, also reasure the other 2 children that they can still give their brother plenty of hugs and things.   again i am very sorry you are going through this and i really hope you have some support for yourself. best wishes and all the best for the future, i hpe it gets better soon for you all.xx|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Please ignore any nasty comments.  I think you can actually get books aimed at children about cancer etc. It may be worth phoning your library or maybe even speak to the care team that are treating your child. Many children sadly experience cancer so I am certain the ward or hospital must have some information on it that is aimed at your child and his/her level of understanding.  If in the Uk you may find contacting Cancer research and or marie curie helpful as again they may have some advice and literature for you.  Also some hospices will have literature and books about illness. Not sure if you are in UK or not.     I think that a child of 6 does not need too much information but perhaps to say that your unwell child has an illness which makes him/her very tired. As for when will he get better that is difficult as he probably has good and bad days. So you will have to say something like that.    I wish you and your family well, xxx|`|aXbSpXhCaa	make a kiddy play up about it and try to explan it to him     and i hope ur 3 year old son gets better soon xxxxxxxx hugs to him :)|`|h4quj3W7aa	wait till hes more matured and explain to him whats cancer|`|7i6qj4OXaa	My answer would be that he has an illness which makes him feel tired and that they should show him patience and treat him kindly.

He needs lots of love and rest so that he can get better. And how he needs lots of help and looking after by the 6 year old. At that age, making them feel important and as though they play a role in making your youngun better will help the 6 year old accept it and behave better. Also make sure you keep telling them all how much you love them, its very easy for your other children to misunderstand you having to give more attention to the poorly one, just let them know you love them still.    I really really hope your littleun gets on the road to recovery soon, im sorry he, and you are having to go through that xxx|`|gMzGP7KWaa	Children of the age of six dont understand the concepts of cells, cancer and death. So you really cant explain it to them, but on the other hand you can continue to talk to them about the symptoms and how they need to be supportive and be kind to the sick child. Why not let them feel important and allow them to participate in the childs care in some simple way, that will allow the children to be more sympathetic toward the sick one. Good luck and I pray that you keep the strenght up because I understand that care giving is hard for anyone.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	Don't wait to explain the situation.  When I was 3, my younger sisters (twins -- 6 wks old) were diagnosed with a retinal cancer and suddenly there was a lot going on.  I was passed from family member to friends while my parents and my sisters had to travel about 600 miles for treatments (we lived in the Pacific).  This unfortunately happened multiple times over the course of 5 years.  I was always trying to make sense of it all, but none of the adults wanted to take the responsibility of explaining the situation to me.  To this day, I confess that I'm a little bitter about it.    Children are not daft.  They can read emotions expertly and it probably bothers them more when you don't explain to them what's going on.    If you have to, break the entire situation down.  Perhaps tell them that our bodies are made up of tiny little cells [teaching example: Legos] and that some of his cells aren't working correctly.  He needs special treatments to fix those cells and it's a very long process.  The kids may get a bit jealous as to all his attention, so you should perhaps say something to generate a bit of empathy in them.  Actually, I would go so far as to stress the empathy.|`|kdSuwt8paa	First of all take no notice of the idiot who said he is going to die.   I am quite sure his doctors have told you that they get very good survival rates nowadays.   Second, the children don't have to have a detailed explanation.    They know that sometimes you can be ill - I am sure they have had the occasional virus etc themselves - and that you get better rather quickly usually, but this illness that the little boy has takes a long time to get better.  Tell them it is called leukemia and the doctors are working hard to make it go away.   Meantime you all have to look after him and love him and look forward to when he is better and can do fun things again.   Try to give the other children some treats unrestricted by what the little boy can manage.    Dad or Mum can have some one on one time with him while the others go to the park or the beach or even the circus or something.   You could rope in grandparents etc to help with this too.   Or even friends and neighbours.    People are usually pleased to be asked.    Everyone who cares for you will long to help and will have little idea what they can do.  Basically be honest with the others.    Tell them when the doctors are pleased (have a little party even to celebrate good results, just with the children)  If it happens that the doctors are not happy on some occasion you can tell the children and  say you hope for better next visit.  If they ask about death (don't bring it up yourself) you can say that the doctors are doing everything to make sure he doesn't die, but sometimes little children can't get better.   Only go into that if they ask.    It is so difficult to spread yourself around all the various needs - not to mention your own needs, which are also important if you are to be the best mother you can be.   Accept any offers of help to spread the load.    Be kind yourself as well as the children.   Good luck with it all.

AA11614449	My friend had the same problem.  To me it seems like there's no difference but it's just you husband wanting to be protective.  There could be a number of reason's your husband feels the way he does.  You should reassure him and if it makes him feel better do the massage while he's at the house so if by the slightest off chance something does happen he'll be near by.      Also if it makes no difference then give the guy a sports massage at your clinic where it will look more professional.    Sometimes our guys over-react and sometimes they are right on.|`|YFuIOVq0aa	I agree that on the surface it may seem ridiculous that there is a difference between massaging a male in your home space vs. clinic space but my experience is - it is different.    It is a matter of perception. We all know that the male of the species is wired differently and thinks differently than we do. The two environments do carry a different atmosphere and a home treatment is perceived as much more personal- for both the client and the therapist.     We all know that you are a professional and your thought process on the treatment is different however, your home is also the home of your spouse and he feels uncomfortable.    In this case, I recommend that female therapists reserve home appointments for female clients until a rapport has been established with a male client. Once that rapport has been established a discussion with your spouse is in order. Identify that this particular person has been to see you several times in the clinic and you would like to extend the privilege of him attending your home space for treatment and ask for your spouses honest feedback.    If your spouse is still not in favor you need to decide which is more important: one client or your spouse.     Having said that- in principle I agree that logic dictates this shouldn't be any different but this is the world of therapeutic massage and sometimes logic gets overruled by human nature and old perceptions.|`|AA11176387	to me..it seems fine..I would tell him after you ask her that his girlfriend will be present and even anyone else that might make him feel comfortable.    You gave your word to this girl and I feel it is wrong to break it..at least he should allow this one time.    doctors do this..have someone of the same sex be in the room when they do pelvic exams so this should make him feel at ease that nothing will go on.    It seems your husband is acting jealous and insecure, you might try to reassure him but I think I would not listen as this isn't the 50s anymore|`|88783c068f66446b3321905f7972cb87aa	Well, I've always had the general opinion that we should pick our fights with our partners. On one hand this is your profession, the way you make a living. On the other hand this is your husband's strong feelings and you should take them into account.    The way I see it you've got a couple of possible solutions so this issue doesn't blow up in your face:  1.) Ask your partner if he would feel better if you scheduled the massage when he is going to be home anyway. His main concern may not be stemming for a jealous or envious place but that of true concern for your well being. It *is* quite different to give a massage in your own home as opposed to working out of a clinic. Remember that this is your husband's home too, how would you feel in the other shoes?  2.) Refund the money to your friend-of-a-friend and give her some recommendations for a referral.  3.) Go for couples counseling to resolve the issue since this is not going to go away if you ignore it.|`|1MX8ENzXaa	By bringing a male client into your home you may be violating your husbands personal space. This is the reason I don't take appointments at my home. It's not a matter of him trusting you.  If it's possible could you see the friend at the clinic on your time off?  You may take a financial hit, but live up to your obligation to provide the massage.  you might also consider doing the massage at the clients home if you think it would be safe.|`|o0JD0hitaa	That does sound complicated.    I am a massage therapist as well. Fortunately my fiancee is very understanding with paying clients who come to my private office. However, she also knows how strict I am about being professional, maintaining draping, and all other aspects of my massage. It helps that, at my office, I do the same for her - same procedure, same draping, same everything except she doesn't pay at the end of the massage.    We have had some issues regarding trades however. As a male therapist, many of the people I trade with are women, who are over 80% of the profession according to recent surveys. I reiterate that we both maintain the same lines of professionalism, even though I've become friends with most of the people I trade massages with, and that it is the only way that I get massage so that I don't have to pay someone for massage.    Talk to your husband, find out why he feels the concerns that he feels. Offer to schedule the massage when he might be home if that feels appropriate to you and helps him to be more comfortable.    It is our profession, and we do have to maintain the business. Hopefully our significant others can understand and respect our professionalism in our business.    On a different subject, I realize that your expenses for your home office are much lower and that some other facility may take a large chunk of the income from a massage, but why are you offering a 50% discount at your home? If the quality of work and environment is the same, the price can be as well.
JexFy4Cnaa	Don't let a nurse tell you what to do. Get a doctors advice. You may have a blood clot or anything. Would you allow someone you cared for to keep on working with a possible serious injury like that ?  Take care of yourself, even if you can't take time off work at least see a doctor.  I would think its normal to feel down like that after your car crash (its bad enough and upsetting even when you don't get hurt), get some extra rest where ever you can...even in your lunch break and do lots of nice things for yourself like have your favorite meal, or get some family / friends around you to help you recover.

Always saying hmm yeah that would be nice i'll try it and never do it. Sometimes i wonder if that's what i want, to do absolutely nothing. But it doesn't make me happy. it seems i haven't found anything in life that i truly enjoy. Same thing here with the friends. I've had great friends throughout my life, but then i go away and don't stay in contact.     I have these same issues but i really think it's just a phase, at least i hope it is. Because what i truly want is like you, to fall madly in love, and have a great family.     I'm sorry i can't really give you any advice. But what i do is i let people drag me out to do stuff. The friends i have now. always asking me to do stuff with them, i really don't want to but i go along anyways. in the end i always end up enjoying myself anyways, but this is just a short term solution because i don't do anything for myself independently.|`|6NZeItMAaa	In our head four types of thoughts are formed, by understanding them, we can start to choose the thoughts which are beneficial for us.    Thoughts necessary or fashionable, those which refer to  our daily routine, for example: what is what I will put today to go to work?    Useless thoughts, those which do not have constructive utility. They are things of the past which one cannot change any more, as what one could have made if one had done this or that. Or of the thoughts about  the future, as what I one will do if These thoughts, even if they are not negative, empty us of our interior force and tire us.    Negative or destructive thoughts, they are most pernicious because they cause the loss of our peace and interior force. They are founded on irritability, desire, envy, etc.  They may be passed, present or future and they can become obsessives.     Positive thoughts, Are those which bring to us a benefit in all the situations. To think positively does not want to say that we are unaware of reality around us. That comprises to find solutions. They mean acceptance, not resignation.    Our spirit requires  its food which is our thought, the quality of this thought is entirely between our hands, even if the external circumstances have their influence.     our bodies needs healthy food and exercise, we should make  the same way with our spirit by choosing best food: the positive thought.
cw5nfgXEaa	Hey, Well I've come across something very interesting. My friend said she had been trying everything for years without much results, and after coming across this little known secret, she lost 40 pounds in 2 weeks.  According to this site, it has not much to do at all with overeating, dieting or will-power, etc, but has alot to do with these parasites or critters living inside your guts. They show you everyhing, from the cause of it and how to get rid of the nasty creatures and the fat for good.   I guess that's why some people put on more weight than others regardless of how much you eat or how well you eat.  Anyway, the site tells you all about it. So heres the link    http://www.goodbyefat4good.com    From Davo  P.S. I recommend working out on top of this to get into really good shape.|`|d7ba5375d0a28158e457f7bc025fe686aa	u must do yoga regularly and jog or swim or bicycling and treadmill too trust me it will help u alot......10 Pts pls pls pls. really need it thanks...|`|FaVYRoXqaa	You can`t change your body shape.

Keep your hands facing downwards, completely flat and relax all the muscles. Begin the exercise by lifting your knees and your torso simultaneously till your hips and knees are flexed and your thighs are near or in contact with your chest. Remain in this pose for nearly a second, then release and lower your torso and legs back to the floor from where you commenced. To increase difficulty in this lower abs workout, avoid keeping your torso and legs on the floor in between repetitions. Rather keep your torso and legs nearly an inch above the floor, all throughout.|`|ZsCqfPaZaa	You cannot lose weight in specific areas on your person.  It is ONLY a full-body thing.

Two years ago I started getting over-production of Gastric Acid related to a neurological condition that affects my Autonomic Nervous System and ended up with ulcers.    Now I am not a smoker and never have been,  I am allergic to NSAIDs so I do not use them and although I love my coffee never have more than two a day.  However I was bringing up several cupfuls of  acid a day.    However once I started on Nexium I was painfree in six (6) weeks.    About 3 months ago I ran out of the calcium carbonate tablets I take (as I don't have much dairy) and my ulcers appeared to be coming back.   As soon as I bought some a couple of weeks later ( I kept forgetting to buy them) my pain was gone within 3 days.    So give yourself at least 6 weeks on the tablets, as it would say on the information leaflet in their box,  and you will soon feel better.    ps. If I were you I'd ask my doctor for iron injections, you'll only need about 6 over about 10 days and you wont get cramping pain from them binding you up.  Ask your doctor for a neuro exam while you are there too.|`|AA11259815	Oh wow my girlfriend is going through the same thing. She has an ulcer, has a cyst, and even back pain (due to a car accident though). Well anyway. Potassium and Prilosec (acid reducer) is what she is doing. She has an ulcer in her stomach cause of food poisoning last year. And it opens up when she drinks alcohol, greasy and spicy foods, and even milk I believe. When it opens, she will throw up blood. How long does it take for one to perforate? I dont know. But she goes through a lot of pain. I try to help her giving her vitamins and telling her not to eat this or that, she wont listen to me. But try taking some potassium pills. Its what the doctors found was the problem with her going through your exact experiences. Thats all I can offer for you. And yeah, it took like 4 visits to the ER for them to finally diagnose her with an ulcer and TRY to find the problem. They thought it was gastrointestinal whatever, then something else until they found her blood was dropping very fast in potassium levels, and realized she does have an ulcer. So take potassium pills in the meantime! If acid reducer isnt working, you might have an ulcer elsewhere. And stay away from 1) alcohol ... 2) greasy food ... 3) spicy food ... 4) milk products. You dont want to irritate it cause if you start throwing up blood you have to go to the ER immediately. Thats all the knowledge I can give you. Potassium might be the trick.|`|gMzGP7KWaa	Yes if you have an unlcer it could be bleeding, from the information you've given here, its highly likely that you do based on the medications your taken. I do hope that your eating food when taking any of those meds, they can cause ulcers if taken on a empty stomach . I would ask my doctor what the plan is from here. If they say nothing even after your pain is presisting then I would get a second opinion. Ask them what your total blood count is, that will tell them if you having a bleeding episode or not. Lighten up on the iron for now untill this is resolved its exrtremely hard on the stomach and causes nausea.Also I hope your not smoking and drinking coffee to any excess, those you dont need right now till you get this problem resolved. Try drinking some caffiene free drinks for now.  Dont stop till you get some answers even though you dont feel well. Good luck to ya. Hope you feel better soon.|`|xFGhGY1haa	Disclaimer: this is the internet, advice here is not a substitute to seeing a health professional.  That being said,   - is the blood fresh or dark? Quantity ? teaspoon/cup/bowl  - you might have a few ailments ongoing at the same time.  - lifestyle change is a good start for gastric symptoms, but if there is blood in stool, i would advice an urgent thorough assessment at the ER - if there is an ulcer and it has perforated, you would usually have difficulty lying flat. Chest x ray would show air under diaphragm, and OGDS - scopy to see your gut would be very helpful.  - your doc might also want to test your urine for infection/ amylase for pancreatitis - but you most likely have peptic ulcer disease.  I end again with the disclaimer that anyone taking medical advice from the internet do so at their own risk - go see a doc.
Ms72jNbBaa	Dear skarheadz,    Are you taking erythramycin now?    One thing you might try for relieving the ear - you might put in a few drops of hydrogen peroxide and let it stay for a few minutes.  Maybe then do the other ear, too, just as a precaution.    Gargle with hot salt water, if you can stand to do that.  Sip clear broth and juices.  Get lots of rest, maybe with your head up somehow.

oVhS4ybvaa	Yes - it's very common and it's treatable. I know because I have anxiety disorder and I've had great success with treatment.  I used to have panic attacks, too, and those are now gone.  Here's what I know from experience:     Stress and anxiety can be treated effectively in a variety of ways:    1. Medications (daily or as-needed)  2. Counseling/Therapy with a professional  3. Self-Help methods like Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy    I've used a combination of all three of these to manage my anxiety disorder.    I would say first he needs to see a counselor. He or she may prescribe a medication to be taken every day (ie. Prozac, Lexapro, Effexor, etc.) , or as needed for particularly stressful times (ie. Xanax). Talking to a counselor can help identify what causes stress and how to deal with it so that it does not become debilitating. In addition to that, I would recommend you locate a cognitive-behavioral therapy program that can be worked on daily in the privacy and comfort of home, and at any time that is convenient. Try a Google search for a torrent of "The Midwest Center's Attacking Anxiety and Depression" program. It's a good program, but it's highly overpriced and you can find the complete torrent, including the workbook, online for free.|`|6NZeItMAaa	Yes, you can have anxiety symtoms all the time when you are under a big stress.

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

You see, it depends on why your brain is doing what it is doing.    One thing that will help is to eliminate neuro-excytotoxins from your diet.    Unfortunately or fortunately depending on how you look at this, you will obsess over this. I know I did at first. The biggest culprit is MSG or monosodium glutamate. On the side, you might only want to drink organic milk too.    Next, look up glutathione. There are two ways to get the stuff that will help you boost your own glutathione. One comes from cows and the other is a chemical version of the same stuff. Oh yes, you cannot take glutathione. It breaks down. You need to take the precursors.    People who have depression and a host of brain related conditions have all found that this helps their symptoms. One Alzheimer's patient who was put on this started to talk again and regained quite a bit of her ability to function.

(he was 9, and children that age need to take in some fat for healthy growth)|`|AA12266052	Dyslipidemia is elevation of plasma cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), or both, or a low high density lipoprotein level that contributes to the development of atherosclerosis. Causes may be primary (genetic) or secondary. Diagnosis is by measuring plasma levels of total cholesterol, TGs, and individual lipoproteins. Treatment is dietary changes, exercise, and lipid-lowering drugs.  Start statin drugs.|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	Cholesterol can be just a feature of the way your body works, and not a dietary thing at all. The doctors will probably put you on statins, which are probably quite safe. Only a very small proportion of the cholesterol in your body will be the result of  a fatty diet, and that means that a diet will make only a small difference.   Some families just suffer from hypercholesterolaemia, and have to take life-long treatment. It sounds as if yours is one of those.  Take the treatment, keep going for tests, and remember that doctors have much more information than when your father was diagnosed.|`|385371073e8d53b7e0a56851b570adabaa	In my experience most people who thik they have a healthy diet just don't.  And like many you neglect to actually say what you are eating.  I don't believe that any doctor would think it was appropriate for someone to be 5ft 11 and a size 8 - 109. I don't think you are telling us everything!  And if you are so slim why wouldyou "not eat much meat, blah blah don't cook it with much oil or fat".  I would not be surprised if your diet was quite disordered.  Get yourself one of the Patrick Holford Low Glyceamic Load books - they are fab and will teach you how to eat a great diet. There are so many myths about fat and cholesterol.  And don't worry too much about the cholesterol.  There is a much greater correlation between heart attacks etc and levels of homocysteine in your blood than there is between cholesterol and blood.

Also, think about investing in a protein shake as this will help build muscle and aide weight gain.  Drink plenty of water, aim for around 2-3 litres a day, especially when exercising as it helps your muscles recover.  Good luck :-)|`|5HtRcpWqaa	If you find that you're under weight,  to gain weight you could just be healthy!  Just eat more than you would usually eat, but not by eating unhealthy foods, you should stick to foods that are good for you.  Good food to help you gain weight are peanut butter, and other variaties of nuts, as they contain high caloric content, but are also good for the average diet.   You could exercise by doing exercises that will increase your muscle content, as muscle weighs more than fat.   Good luck!|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Tools to Help You Gain Weight:    Use these tips and tools to help gain weight:    Add healthy calories to breakfast with an extra slice of whole-grain toast and peanut butter.   Mid-morning and afternoon snacks should be nutritious, not junk. Trail mixes contain healthy nuts, dried fruits and can add healthy calories to your diet.   Don't add calories to your meals by choosing unhealthy fried foods such as french fries, chicken nuggets and fish sticks. Choose healthy foods such as baked potatoes, baked chicken and fish, just make your portions a bit bigger.     Keep your meals balanced. One meal should have a healthy protein source such as fish, low fat meat, chicken or legumes plus two or three servings of vegetables. Green vegetables add lots of vitamins and phytonutrients while starchy potatoes and corn add extra calories.   Drink healthy beverages such as milk and fruit juices to add calories. Don't choose sugary sodas, which only add calories and no nutrition.

Diflucan one I've heard is good and it's not too expensive and you don't need a prescription so no embarrassing visits to the doctor.    and yeah as the girl said above me home treatments don't cure the problem they just temporarily get rid of it.    Hope this helped you (:|`|0f3bc48132aa07ffed3092140c4e2b88aa	The answer, as someone mentioned before, is live plain yougurt! I got rid of my thrush with this years ago and it's never come back! I just carried the stuff around with me in a sealed pot and every time I'd had a wee and cleaned myself I would spread the yogurt on the affected areas. Ok, you do get a bit of a slight cheesy smell as the day wears on, but it's not too bad and I think I only used the one pot - gotta be LIVE yogurt though! Good luck!|`|88783c068f66446b3321905f7972cb87aa	Yogurt. Take it both internally and externally. Find a good, natural brand with an expiration date that is some ways away (the farther it is the fresher the yogurt is), and dip a tampon into it (or your finger) to apply it to the walls of the vagina. Ask your health food store for recommendations on a good probiotic supplement that you can take internally to speed up the process.    If this recurs you'll want to speak with your naturopathic doctor for dietary changes, lifestyle changes and other natural health suggestions.|`|BJERgbM5aa	Douche with a mixture of warm water and vinegar.

Someone else here may be able to advise better on this one.|`|QiPGVHGNaa	Not really. may a salt bath. but i'll tell you this.i suffer alot from thrush and it just keeps coming back again and again. The only way to treat it so it is GONE for good, is by diflucan one or a visit to the doctor. It can be a little embarrassing but so what? would you rather be in pain? the doctor see's it all the time. Home remedies won't treat it for good.

GmYZcOs6aa	i'm the same -- it's pretty strange isn't it? you can't do anything other than change your sleeping habits... go to bed before 11, read a book or do something relaxing, etc. if you fall asleep earlier, you'll wake up earlier, but the hours before midnight are some of the most crucial in sleep cycles. give it a try, it works for me! getting to bed early enough is the hard part, but trust me it's worth it. good luck xx
OKPFeBtYaa	You're still dwelling on something that happened five years.  Not to mention, in the absolute prime of your life.  Of course they'll get better.  If you cannot see that things will not be better, it's because you are being irrational.  If you keep thinking a stupid thought (I'm doomed) you start to believe it, even though I don't even know you, but I know you aren't doomed.    First of all don't be so melodramatic.  Just because it rains today, doesn't mean it's going to rain every day for the next 10 years.    Second of all, talk to someone.  Friend, family, even therapy.  There's no shame in it, and you deserve to have the chance to change.    If you are really feeling depressed, your doctor may suggest medication.  Again, there's no shame in it, and they really help you start over again.    Just begin by taking some action, even a small action, to get out of your funk.  The only thing holding you back is your own negative thinking, and it would be a shame to let that ruin your life.  Best of luck.|`|hSTFj3sEaa	Many women these days are telling themselves they can have a wonderful life wihout men to complete them - and it's been done so many times before! Even in the past: just look at Queen Elizabeth the First, I know it's a lame example, but she never married as she claimed she was married to England - and look at all the good she did!England's first decent royal lmao.    I think that if when you think of your friends you only think "Oh, I ahve a few, you know" then they mustn't mean too much to you? if I'm wrong, I'm sorry to ofend you but if I am right set yourself this goal: get closer to ever one of them and make some new ones. When you meet a person and they remind you of a sister that destiny forgot to give you that's when you know you have something fantastic. You are only young, you're still gorgeous - go to nightclubs, get out, take a chance and don't just wait for Mister perfect, try and settle for Mister. Sweet, Mr. Interesting, mr. Funny, Mr. great-with-his-hands or even Mister. Take-my-breath-away. Just have fun and start hobbies. Oh, btw, Mrs. Dangerous is great, too lol. Go spastic until you find something you enjoy - Tennis, yoga, basketball, swimming, meditation, reading, writing, singing, playing guitar, going to concerts and whatnot. Ohh, and set goals for your job to get to the top or to switch careers into something you're passionate about. Don't cramp yourself in a lame offcie job. If you don't ahve the essentials - go back to college or tafe or whatever. How can you lose hope when there is so much opportunity and support in this world, sweetie? I don't really believe you've truly given up, I just think you  need a bit of time to calm yourself and start fresh =) Try things like charity work, fund raisers and recycling - if you feel like you are helping other people and things, you end up helping yourself and you feel SO GOOD, trust me!! You have all of your life ahead of you to experience stuff.     Like that other guy said, the meaning of life - as far as we know - is to have fun and enjoy yourself. You believe that you're lost but if you take the advice these kindly people are giving you, you'll find meaning!!. Also, I find learning can make you happy because you impress people with your knowledge.And prowess in mechanics, pool and stuff really turns some guys on especially if you trick them and tell them you're hopeless. oh, and step out of your comfort zone once in a while - do something stupid and reckless. learn how to ride a motorbike, go swimming with sharks and all that crazy stuff. The main point I should stress is to not stress, to feel your emotions, to experience life to the fullest, to appreciate the clouds in the sky and the dew of the morn, to meet as many people as you can, to set goals and achieve them.!!!!!!    If you are still lost after this, but I have all the confidence in you that you will find your way, then ask family/ friends for help. relationships are one of the dearest things in life. ohh, also, since you feel so deeply  - write a story or a poem and see if you can get it published or just keep it as a reminder not to go back there that you ahve other choices because you always do. oh, and I'll fan you and you can keep me updated with how you are going and you can tell me if you get that book published!!    urrghh, good luck!!!

Now I do feel hopeless, and feel like its me, not them...even when Friends have hope and are convinced i'll meet someone soon, i just want to shake them and tell them it wont happen.    i believe that positive thinking and having hope leads to good things..but at the moment i'm a master of my own doom because i've lost hope and faith in myself now.    i really really do hope thing work out for you and I.....take care.|`|lOeM1KZ7aa	Sometimes life feels like a constant uphill journey.

6NxEZ8SOaa	Its sounds like you may have it.    You tonsils/glands will be noticeable swollen if you do.    If you are suffering from fevers you may have contracted glandular fever, as the symptoms can be similar however your tonsils can be significantly less swollen.     Go to a doctor and get some antibiotics. A common indication if you have glandular over tonsillitis is you will gain a rash as a reaction from the antibiotics in the form of red dots scattered across your body.    Even if you can't sleep ensure you get lots of rest and have lots a vitamins, water and fruit juice.|`|AA12400635	It could be but it could also be a lot of other things. You need to get to a doctor ASAP because tonsillitis could hamper your breathing if left unchecked. As a child I had chronic tonsillitis and stopped breathing all together on two occasions because my tonsils had swollen so much. Thankfully my parents were there and aware both times, after the 2nd time the doctors and my parents decided to remove my tonsils even though I was very young at the time.    I also used to spike a good enough fever to hallucinate when I got tonsillitis and found I felt worst in the early morning and the mid evening.    In any case get yourself to a doctor, tonsillitis or no you need to get it checked out and taken care of.

ZfhVGgVMaa	I need more imformation to answer this correctly.  How old are you, are you on any medications?  This is tinnitis, which is just a ringing or a buzzing in the ear.  It usually happens after trauma or when you are on medications or with age.  You need to see an ENT and have them test your further, it can be the start or the sign of an infection that is causing all that.  But you also need to record what positions you head has to be in for it to start and stop, this might be irritation of the nerve .  Contact me if you have more problems|`|7g69iD5Taa	Well..I dont know if younger people get it, but my grandpa has it. It is called Tinnitus. Check it out on wikipedia. It could happen maybe because of an ear infection, foreign objects or wax in your ear, ear allergies that dont allow the fluid to drain and cause wax build-up, and injury from loud noises. Also, if you took to much aspirin (like my grandpa did) you can get it. You should get it checked out by a professional doctor.
AA11785060	At 19 you should be grown physically in height unless you entered puberty late and just recently grew.  There is no reason at all boys should be the same height as their fathers, or the "like father like son" phrase goes-- you get just as many genes from your mother, plus your dad may have got his height from his mother, you may be getting your height genes from his dad- or from your other grandparents.

AA12324049	I don't know about fast but I know what will work:    If you have a bit too much bodyfat covering your abs tthe only way to tone it up is to burn more fat. Ever wonder why so many of those contestants on "Survivor" have six pack abs by the end of the show? It is because they have burned off that layer of fat covering their abs! Here are some tips to burn fat and lose weight:     Drink a lot of water (8 - 10 glasses) - water keeps you hydrated and burns fat!    Never drink soda unless it is diet (regular soda has tons of sugar)    Try not to eat after 8 p.m. (late night snacking can be your downfall as you have no opportunity to burn it off)    Eat as much natural food as you can (fruits and veggies are way better for you than processed snacks and they make you feel full longer)    Fill baggies with healthy snacks so whenever you are hungry, it is easy to eat the right things (examples: grapes, air popped popcorn, celery, etc.)    Easy workout tip I picked up from The Biggest Loser: do jumping jacks during commercials when you are watching tv. During an hour show you can burn 300 calories doing this!    Keep a food/exercise log and write down everything you eat and drink and record your workouts. It helps you become aware of your habits and if you are still unsatisfied with your progress you can show it to your doctor and they can see where the problem is.    Remember: losing weight is not your goal, losing fat is! If I were you I would ignore your scale for now and just go by how your clothes fit and your measurements.     If you try these tips I am sure you will be successful - good luck!    P.S. If your stomach is the only place where you have excess fat then it shouldn't take you too long to lose it there if you do it the healthy way.|`|X9QOHRLFaa	hi the truth is only way to effectively and permanently loose weight is by working out and eating right , well lets put it this way walking for an hour burns no more than 220 calories, where as a kilogram of fat has over 7000 calories. So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info. These guys even offer free fitness consultation to everyone, so if you want you can give them a call. it really helped me alot , hope it does the same for you    www.xattack.in|`|K6OhpTmqaa	eat health foods, and cycle.|`|aFSgdIlzaa	Do some exercises such as dancing, maybe try out a DVD that has dancing.. proper cardio exercises.    drink water instead of fizzy drinks    eat more fruit + veg

You can take some OTC meds. that will temporarily ease your discomfort (ask the pharmacist about them). Warning though, they turn your pee a bright orange and it stains your underwear (it will not wash out) so wear old undies, lol!   You can call your Dr. and see if they will just renew your prescription but they will most likely want you to come in and get a urine test.  I know, it's a pain in the neck!  I just had one and I was 100% sure that what it was but my Dr. made me come in anyways.  They usually prescribe Cipro.  My advice is get in this morning because there's nothing more painful than a horrible UTI and it can cause serious problems.  You may want to ask about why you may have these frequent UTIs.  You didn't drink on your first 'bout of antibiotics, did you?  That will may them ineffective.  The biggest culprits are frequent sex, not wiping from front to back (I know, gross!), and bubble baths.  GOOD LUCK!

The condition is so miserable and the medicine is so effective and quick.  It's dangerous to try to diagnose your own situation - the doctor has much better diagnostic tools in this case.

XvGQq1gBaa	You can never be to skinny to start training.   A lot of great body builders and weight lifters started when they were extremely skinny.  If you goal is pure muscle mass and strength.  You need to eat as much protein and calories as possible.  I think if you google the protein amount for your height and weight you can find how many grams of protein you need to take in.  I would suggest up to a 6000 calorie diet if you are wanting to gain weight.  Best|`|6f52c047b2a7fd8bfc275fa11892816caa	Start weight training now, there's no such thing as too skinny to start.  As for diet - no junk.  Eat fruit and veg for vitamins and minerals.  Good carbs for energy - wholewheat bread rice and pasta, sweet potatoes.  Protein for building muscle - eggs, fish,lean red meat, chicken.  Maye add protein shakes as well.  Up your calorie count to about 4500 a day (usual recommended calories for men is 2500).  Pay for one session with a trainer at the gym so that you learn the proper techniques especially with the free weights and then train 3 or 4 times a week.  Other all round exercise such as a martial art might be enjoyable for you (it worked for me anyway).|`|RLbsaBLOaa	eat some high protein foods and get whey gain milkshakes and fatten up a bit first, tuna is great for protein. also once you start after every weight lifting episode take in lots of protein and shake etc  also you need some fat to turn to muscle|`|kTRcYaFcaa	Hey there,    My heart went out to you when I saw your question, simply because that was me about 300 years ago, or so it seems anyway!!!    Seriously, I have been weight training for over 25 years and have made most of the mistakes, so here is some sound advice for you.    Just start!! Get a good book which shows you the exercises and how to do them properly - this is very important, both from your safety viewpoint and also that your efforts are rewarded.    Stick with what are called "compound" exercises - these are Squats [the best!!], Leg Press, Bench Press, Shoulder Press and what I call bodyweight curls, which are curling on a parallel bar using your own weight - if you have not got access to this, use a good bar for bicep curls. Stick to just those exercises - they are they ones which use multiple muscle groups and they will help build your muscle the quickest. Say away from the other designer type exercises - they are a waste of time and do little but waste energy - trust me on this, I have learnt all this the hard way over the years.    Any GOOD training book will confirm all this.    On the subject of nutrition, just eat well and healthily and stay away from any sort of supplementation - if you are eating a healthy diet, you do not need anything else. I tend to eat a lot of fruits and get extra supplementation that way, the natural way. Stay away from sugars, alcohol [sorry!!] and of course smoking - death, literally!!    As time rolls by you will learn what works for you and what does not - stick at it, it is one of the best things I have ever done in my life and cannot imagine my not doing it - it has become as much a part of my day as eating breakfast for example.    And by the way, re one comment already posted - fat CANNOT turn to muscle - it is a physical impossibility. Only muscle can be grown into bigger muscle. Fat is caused by overeating and disappears when energy used is less than energy taken in - simple.    Best of luck my friend - go to it - by the by, it is also a great exercise pastime for the ladies as it helps prevent against the bones getting weaker as we age - putting weight on bones strengthens them, so if your mum is interested, or you have an aunt, or aunts - get them pumping weight also!!!!!!.    Best regards - just go do it!!!
ykCo6SDOaa	"Can Garlic Lower Cholesterol Levels?    Whilst some individual studies have shown that garlic can be effective in reducing "bad" cholesterol (LDLs), the overall body of evidence is inconclusive. In particular the 2007 study appears to shed serious doubt on the reality behind garlic's reputation in this area. Thus it would be unwise to draw a definite conclusion that garlic can be used to combat "bad" cholesterol foods.    How then do we explain those studies that do show garlic works as a cholesterol treatment? Do we simply discard them as using flawed methodology? If - for the sake of argument - we assume there is some validity in those that found links, how do we explain the different findings? One possibility is that the efficacy of garlic in combatting cholesterol etc depends upon some other, unknown factor - for example the exact variety or manner of preparation of the garlic. Since this factor is unknown, it is not possible to design tests to eliminate it. Another possibility is that the reputed cholesterol lowering properties of garlic are effective only for specific subgroups of the population.    If you are concerned about elevated cholesterol levels then you should not turn to garlic as an alternative to medical treatment - get advice from your doctor. However if your doctor approves then you might like to consider eating more garlic as part of a balanced diet "just in case". If nothing else it's a tasty alternative to salt".      also see:  http://www.gonando.com/how-to-lower-chol...    and    http://www.webmd.com/cholesterol-managem...|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	Basically it dosen't- according to recent studies.    Last year a big US study was conducted and it found that eating garlic raw, or taking it as a suppliment does not lower cholesterol levels. The best way to prevent heart disease is to eat a healthy diet ( including your five a day fruit and veg), and take frequent exercise.    The results of the study found no statistically significant effects. Here is the article:-     Stanford University researchers     "Garlic has been used for thousands of years in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases - the first recorded use was in ancient Egypt 3,500 years ago.     Recently allicin, a compound in garlic has been shown to prevent the formation of cholesterol in over 90 animal studies and, in the early 1990s, studies in humans also suggested there could be benefits.     But the studies were poorly designed, and did not provide conclusive proof.     Even so, garlic supplements are often promoted as cholesterol-lowering agents, the researchers carrying out this latest study say.    They monitored 170 people aged 30 to 65 who had moderately high LDL (bad) cholesterol levels for six months. They were divided into four groups. One was asked to eat a four-gram clove of garlic each day, the second were given a powdered garlic supplement, the third had aged garlic extract - which has been treated in alcohol for up to two years - while the fourth group had a dummy supplement.     All were advised to avoid foods known to contain garlic and to cut their intake of onions and chives, which are known to contain some of the same chemical compounds found in garlic.Blood cholesterol levels were assessed each month.     Writing in Archives of Internal Medicine, the researchers led by Dr Christopher Gardner, said the findings had contradicted their expectations that garlic, particularly in its raw form, would be effective in lowering cholesterol. They said: "There were no statistically significant effects of the three forms of garlic on LDL cholesterol concentrations."     Judy O'Sullivan, of the British Heart Foundation, said: "This small study shows that eating raw cloves of garlic or taking garlic supplements has no benefit for the heart."
NzSA6dmyaa	as always i would say u shouldnt do it these things are illegal for a reason (generally because one of the possible side effects is death) ok but you still wanna do it hey its your choice so here's the advice.     keep cool and dont let yourself over heat one of the major side effects, drink plenty for the 24 hours before doing it, dont go crazy but just make sure your not thirsty and make sure u dont dehydrate for 24 hours after taking again tho dont go crazy just have a little drink of water every now and again   and i would really recommend u have some1 nearby if the s**t hits the fan u need some1 to help u out|`|bxUjcj3Laa	best advice for u would be to call one of the drug lines like talk to frank they can talk to you about any queries and give you info so that you can then make an informed choice as to what you want to do. Please tell somone you have taken something as it might go wrong and could be fatal, im sure you would want the right help if something did go wrong. There is nothing wrong with being curious about drugs just do it safely!  and please don't be mislead in thinking that no one will not believe you when you take E the pressure in your brain increases and your pupils dilate so it will be obvious you are under the influence of something! Good luck|`|ixPVr23Waa	Ectasy is a dangerous drug. I could not recomend it to anyone particularly for first time recreationsl drug use.    Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ectasy or e) is a drug that is commonly used by party goers but when mixed with other drugs, in particular alcohol, can be fatal.    Although some people get a sense of:  euphoria,  decreased feelings of hostility and increased feelings of security,  feelings of peace and mental clarity  and heightenned senses    It can also cause:  restlessness,  teeth grinding,  the "come down" malaise/weakness,  bluured vision (for days),  hyperthermia (high fevers- leads to spasms),  dehydration,  severe hyponatraemia (very low sodium causing death, muscle spasms, hospitalisations)  serotonin syndrome (messes with brain chemicals- can be fatal).    I had a mate that had a heart attack from ectasy (he took half a tablet) and now has lifelong heart damage. He was a fit 19 year old rugby player.    I have seen many lives ruined or shortenned due to ectasy use.    If you do plan on taking it i suggest you are with friends you trust, take only a half and have access to a phone just in case. But please don't take it its really not worth it.    I hope this helps,    Chris- Registered Nurse|`|uk0rxbVIaa	It's not ok for a second, third or whatever drug. Despite the fact that kids think it's cool feeling euphoria or **** like that, it's not ok. It really messes up with your brain and you could easily feel quite the opposite of euphoria. You could end up in a hospital with serious brain damage. You should also consider the fact that drugs induce paranoia and a large palette of other psychological disorders. There's no point in repeating that you shouldn't be alone, but I'm going to anyway :)  You shouldn't be alone , and you shouldn't do drugs at school or in your home, there are serious consequences if you get caught. Last, good luck if you want to do this, but think twice before you actually do it.|`|SXYtLoeoaa	Okay, from experience, do NOT take it at school, especially for the first time. Taking a half is okay. My first time, I took one and then waited an hour to take the other. Just watch water intake, gum is a great idea. You may feel lightheaded for about 3 minutes but then you feel awesome. Just don't take it alot and get addicted, or take it alot and then stop cuz you'll get depressed.|`|cj7CYD9haa	Sad losers take drugs. Cant you just enjoy life with out sticking junk into your body?

K5pUbkbkaa	Does he want to quit? Really? 'Cause you can't quit for him.    You can support him, help keep him away from dealers or people he'd smoke pot with. Distract him. The idea is to keep him level until he can 'get by' without having a session. But he's got to be the one to stick with it. You can help him until you're half dead, it won't do jack unless he's willing to suffer through it.

The best thing that worked to improve mine was to spend more time running, and after two months of working up my cardio from 30 minutes, I was able to run a marathon in 3:37.      If you need just a little boost to get you motivated, try Caffeinated mints.

e9js4PDaaa	Several different factors may be involved in the development of sleepwalking. These may include genetics (traits that run in families), environmental and medical conditions.    Sleepwalking is not associated with other sleep problems, sleeping alone in a room or with others, fear of the dark, or anger outbursts.    Genetics     Sleepwalking occurs more frequently in identical twins, and is 10 times more likely to occur if a first-degree relative has a history of sleepwalking. Therefore, it is thought the condition can be inherited.    Environmental Factors     Certain factors may cause a person to sleepwalk, such as:    Sleep deprivation   Chaotic sleep schedules   Stress   Alcohol intoxication   Drugs such as sedative/hypnotics (drugs that promote relaxation or sleep), neuroleptics (drugs used to treat psychosis), stimulants (drugs that increase activity), and antihistamines (drugs used to treat symptoms of allergy)   Medical Conditions     Medical conditions that have been linked to sleepwalking include:    Arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms)   Fever   Gastroesophageal reflux (food or liquid regurgitating from the stomach into the food pipe)   Nighttime asthma   Nighttime seizures (convulsions)   Obstructive sleep apnea (condition in which breathing stops temporarily while sleeping)   Psychiatric disorders, for example, posttraumatic stress disorder, panic attack, or dissociative states, such as multiple personality disorder|`|Ht3tnJgXaa	when u sleep to much time to get up to much fo one think is not good
LNV6xT6Eaa	yup..|`|SpL2MPDraa	Yeah, I'd say it would be safe. especially seeing as how I've done doses ranging from 300 to 900mg for a week straight...  So yes, I'd say you're quite safe.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	yes|`|noCVbwY3aa	Yes, if you can stay at that number, you're probably doing yourself a favor.  DXM can be a neuroprotector, helping in the prevention of Alzheimer's.  Taking large doses, like 300 - 900 mgs for more than a week can be hard on the mind and body (I'm guilty too, don't worry), but taking on a healthy lifestyle can turn that around (I work full time, exercise, eat well, and trip at night, and I'm in great shape, mentally and physically).      So in short, yes, you're safe.  :)
Ms72jNbBaa	Dear Chick,    Migraines are absolutely a pain!  Which of the remedies you are using seems most helpful to you?    My migraines stopped about the time of menopause.  Before then I took Imitrex, which I understand can deaden your memory.  I also took ativan, to keep calm and avoid triggering a migraine.  That too can cause memory problems.      Other things that helped me were walking, sleeping, warm baths, magnesium, and eating a potato or two plain.    I've heard that the supplement shake Reliv gets rid of migraines within about five weeks.  You can email me about this if you like.    Best wishes to you and your mom!|`|oKjcTZypaa	You should ask your dr to prescribe Epidrin or Midrin and give that a try. It's less intrusive on your body than the triptans and less addictive than Lorcet. It's basically a combination medicine that has a pain killer, vein fixer, and muscle relaxant all in one. Check out http://www.MIDRIN.org for more info. Hope this helps.|`|oP3VVW5raa	Find out the cause of the migraines and eliminate them - the medications and the causes.    Food allergies ?    Environmental allergies ?    Too much sun ?|`|wX5xoAN8aa	I would say the pills and shots are equally bad. Try some home remedies.

aFK7yD4xaa	I have never shopped in the US, but I can say from what I've seen on here it seems a lot easier in the UK. For a start, many of the foods in the supermarkets (all the own brand stuff, which is a big proportion) has allergy advice on the label somewhere. So you just look in the box, and if it doesn't mention gluten, it's safe. Also, you can rely on the label "gluten free" - which I was surprised to find means "99% gluten free" or "gluten free except for ingredients which form part of other ingredients" in the US.    Most bigger supermarkets have a "free from" section (which isn't enormous, and caters for other diets than ours), but there are also gluten free products scattered around the store in amongst the normal food. Like, the rice flour and so on is not necessarily on the free from shelf. Corn Thins are next to the Snack-a-Jacks, so on. So it's a good idea to get used to one supermarket at a time, then eventually, you can go right to the section where whatever you want is kept - since gluten free stuff tends not to be moved around according to the season, like other things.    Smaller local stores are very unlikely to have much, if anything, that is classified as gluten free. My local co-op does sell Mrs Crimbles coconut macaroons - which are gorgeous - and I don't think they realize that is a gluten free baker. In fact, most stores that sell Mrs Crimbles products put them in the main section, they are that good, and no more expensive than comparable products.    The one thing I think you will miss if you eat it at the moment, is a decent quality gluten free bread. There are a few high class gluten free bakers, but it's hit and miss as to whether there's one in your area. Sfaik, there's none near me, though I used to eat so little of the stuff I often threw part of the loaf away, so I haven't gone on a big hunt (at those prices).
mYGbxuCAaa	dont its fattening, fat people eat it! the salt makes you gain    try eating extra lean ham and mustard on wheat bread, with natural peanutbutter on celery(ants on a log!)|`|JshtWS94aa	You can eat about 6 crackers with tuna and a little mayo,for a snack,and not gain any weight, I eat it all the time.|`|2ynZARB4aa	it has a lot of salt in it, and so would the crackers. but no you shouldnt gain too much weight by just eating that.|`|oP8blO9Paa	don't eat that shyt!  make your own w/ fresh ingredients.  who knows how long that stuff has been sitting!|`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	No, eat up.
4CyXKudJaa	Whenever I'm going to vomit, my mouth starts watering and my throat feels really open and airy... it's probably just a bug, go to a doctor.
ax2t6AVzaa	Seems like a lot of food when you write it all down. Maybe you're not hungry, but bored.  Maybe you should have had just one smoothie and chosen between the soup or bagel.  But your size isn't terrible by any means.   Today I ate a breakfast burrito, a slice of bacon, a salad, a pbj sandwich and a smoothie.  I feel stuffed. But I'm pregnant so I should eat a little more.    Good luck with your dieting!|`|MNaJQB6taa	no i think you haven't overeaten that's the perfect amount i would say and you don't shouldn't be dieting at your age because it is unhealthy and 11stone isn't over Weight it's probably ideal for your age group :D
9CHjZ8sBaa	Running or walking briskly is a good place to start. If you do 30-45 minute sessions of this sort 3 or 4 times a week in your zone (at a fast yet comfortable pace), that will help.    These are the cost-free options, if you have access to a bicycle or swimming pool, doing similiar levels of activity is just as good.    Aerobic activity like the above helps overall weight loss and toning in most areas of the body.    Of course this works hand in hand with cutting back on food. So if you are serious, cut out all sugary snacks, chocolate, chips etc., replace with a healthier option like fruit and vegtables.    A rule of thumb is dont eat after eight o clock at night. And try and supress craving with keeping busy while drinking plenty of water.    These are tried and tested methids of weight loss. No use in crash dieting as you lose muscle, which helps burn calories the more you have.    Hope this helps|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	Sorry but this is a stupid and terribly wrong approach.

KL1Y5FeHaa	Hello. Are you wanting to go on the pill to make your period more bearable? If this is the reason, just tell your mum that you periods are really heavy, painful and long etc and you want to go and talk to the doctor about getting on the pill for these reasons. I went on the pill before I was even sexually active, for my periods. I had really bad period pain, where i would have to have 1 day off work each month.   My periods are barely there now, they are 2 days long and I only have very mild pains. When I went to go on the pill, I told my doctor   "I am interested in going on "the pill" ". She asked me several questions but they do not do an exam, she told me that she was putting me on the main pill that all women go on at first, and, if it wasnt right for me we would trial others. I went through 3, the one I am on now is really great. We discussed side effects of the pill and how it works etc.|`|uiVEaxjqaa	Go tp planed parent hood you don't need your mom to get it there you just have to be able to pay for it and get a ride there. or just say you want to get on it to help clear up your skin because it will do that or tell her you have bad periods and you want to be on it because of that.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Your Dr. will give you a prescription after a vaginal examine

To make it less confrontational, y dont you suggest it like...    'i think that there are sooo many overweight people in this country.  Im thinking of exercising a little more and eating a bit healthier too.  Do you think we should do it together...like b a support for each other?'    By saying it like this, you are encouraging without making her feel sh*t.  Just, dont expect miracles.  She may lose the weight slowly and also struggle.  This is where you need to be really supportive of her and help her along.  Why not organise a pampering session for her too, make her feel pretty in herself.    At the end of the day, you love her.  Whatever happens, you love her.

giANBdAOaa	Relax, you are perfectly normal. Everyone worries when they are pregnant, especially for the first time. You didnt know you were pregnant and you were just following your daily routine. I think its important for a pregnant woman to relax and try not to worry too much (I know its easy for a guy to say). I'm sure your diet has made no difference to the baby at all. The foetus draws all the vitamins it needs through the placenta from your body, so its not like the baby has been eating at Macdonalds itself. There are people who smoke and drink and have worse diets than you who still have healthy babies (though please dont drink or smoke!). Having said that, yes your diet being healthy from now will definately help pass on the vitamins to the baby which will result in him or her growing better and being a happier child, especially while the internals organs are growing later on. Maybe add some folate or folic acid to your diet soon. This is good for the baby's nervous system development, but probably only for another week or two. After that I dont think it does much.  Now that you are aware that you are pregnant it might be a good impetus to make some changes and to try to eat healthier. Im sure everything will be fine. The fact that you are asking the question means that you are a caring mum who is already worried about her little one. I think the biggest difference is your emotions during the pregnancy. Try to be happy and enjoy the experience and your baby has more chance of being happy and relaxed too.   Good job. Hope it all works out well.|`|LiPcDDrxaa	its not that bad, but def. not good either. but it is okay as long as u eat VERY healthy for the rest of the time!|`|ptx4fM10aa	Eating fast food is not really bad for your baby or will affect the baby's growth. A lot of people assume that being pregnant means you have to stop what youve been doing before, but its really not like that. Jus cuz you're carrying a baby doesnt mean you have to change everything. When your not pregnant, eating out everyday isnt too healthy either so pregnant or not, as long as you dont go overboard, you'll be fine :)

Until recently, doctors didnt recognize this as a real pain syndrome. Even today, many women do not receive a diagnosis. They may also remain isolated by a condition that is not easy to discuss. Researchers are working hard to uncover the causes of vulvodynia and to find better ways to treat it.    Types of Vulvodynia  Vulvodynia affects the vulva, the external female genital organs. This includes the labia, clitoris, and vaginal opening.    There are two main subtypes of vulvodynia:      Generalized vulvodynia ispain in different areas of the vulva at different times. Vulvar pain may be constant or occur every once in a while. Touch or pressure may or may not prompt it. But this may make the pain worse.   Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome is pain in the vestibule. This is the entrance to the vagina. Often a burning sensation, this type of vulvar pain comes on only after touch or pressure, such as during intercourse.   Possible Causes of Vulvodynia  Doctors dont know the causes of vulvodynia. And there is no evidence that infections, such as sexually transmitted diseases, cause vulvodynia.    Researchers are trying to find the causes of vulvodynia. They may include:    Nerve injury or irritation   Abnormal response in vulvar cells to an infection or trauma   Genetic factors that make the vulva respond poorly to chronic inflammation   Hypersensitivity to yeast infections   Muscle spasms   Allergies or irritation to chemicals or other substances   Hormonal changes   History of sexual abuse   Frequent antibiotic use|`|AA12198724	She could just have a UTI.

I'm asking b/c I was spotting (bleeding a little bit) the other day after sex and I was afraid I was pregnant--I did some research and found out I had a "micro-tear"--a small tear in the delicate skin "down there." Vaginal tears occur after rough sex or when she's just not lubricated enough. The urine will sting the tear with its acidity. Just for thoroughness sake, she could get tested for STD. But the pain when urinating is a sure sign of a vaginal tear. She could check it out with a mirror!

N1WWopVPaa	I recommend that you go to an endocrinologist and get another entire thyroid panel done, rather than just the one that your regular doctor would do. You could be in just the beginning stage of thyroid disease; you just have all of the classic symptoms here. The entire panel should be evaluated by a specialist, in my opinion, before thyroid disease is totally ruled out for you right now, due to all of your symptoms. A physical exam as well by the same specialist would be important for you. An endocrinologist is the kind of MD who specializes in thyroid diseases.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	I am a vegetarian also but do not have the problems you seem to have.    To make sure you are eating a healthy diet, click on this link and then click on the vegetarian food pyramid.  Compare this to what you are eating, see if you are falling short anywhere.

As for the dry skin, sometimes dry skin is actually skin flakes/cells that need to be removed with exfoliation.  Try your legs first...Use a gentle exfoliator like a sugar scrub you can buy or one you can make it out of 2-3 T olive oil mixed with 1 T sugar.  Wet your legs in the shower. Turn the shower off then gently rub this mixture on, all over your legs and rub very lightly for a min or two.  Rinse off while finishing your shower. Be careful, sometimes the oil will make the shower a bit slippery. But it works great.    For your face, see below...  Use the gentlest scrub for dry skin, usually a sugar/oil scrub too.  Then you can follow with a soothing facial mask, also for dry skin.    I use plain sour cream mixed with alittle honey, 1 T cream, 1 tsp honey.  Rub this on gently and leave on for 15 mins.

It also absorbs excessive oil from our skin, which is a leading cause of acne.        * Dilute the Apple Cider Vinegar in water by one part of vinegar and 3 to 4 parts of water.      * Apply the solution directly to your skin with clean cotton, and leave it there for about ten minutes.      * After ten minutes, rinse off the vinegar.      * Repeat this three times a day. For severe cases of acne, the solution can be used overnight without rinsing.    For more severe acne, the water ratio can also be reduced to 2 or 3 parts per one part of vinegar, but this stronger solution should not be left on overnight.    Acne Home Remedy Using Tea Tree Oil  Tea Tree Oil is a great anti-bacterial natural substance. When applied on acne, tea tree oil helps the immune system to kill the bacteria and consequently reduce the inflammation. Using Tea Tree Oil in conjunction with Vitamin E supplements (an anti-oxidant) and an excellent healing agent, can not only heal the blemishes but also cure scar tissues.        * Dab a cotton swab into the tea tree oil.      * Gently apply the oil onto the acne areas with the swab before going to bed.      * Rinse off the tea tree oil in the morning.      * Take Vitamin E supplements as directed on the package to speed up the healing process.

Also you can ask how they feel after 10 laps around the track and you can't catch your breath.And nothing is helping.

Do I believe in God? Am I going to meet Him now? What will my parents and friends feel if I die? But your mind is all confused and you don't know what's happening anymore. Did someone call 911?

n7KCez59aa	Hi !      All the patient is aware of is tummy pain and feeling a bit fevered. To doctors it can look exactly like appendicitis and it is only clear that this is not the case once the surgeon does an operation and finds the appendix to be perfectly healthy.     So, with 'mesenteric adenitis', which settles all by itself, it is a matter of waiting until it goes away, but being careful to exclude appendicitis.      What is the treatment?    No treatment is necessary, other than simple painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen  (if wanted). If a bacterial infection is suspected, you may be given antibiotics, but this is to  treat the underlying infection rather than the mesenteric adenitis.  If your symptoms are getting worse, or last longer than two weeks, you should see a doctor  urgently for a review.    What is the outlook?  The symptoms usually improve within a few days, and will almost always clear up  completely within two weeks.     References:  . Burke, B. Mesenteric adenitis. emedicine, updated March 2008.  .

QjwBMQbjaa	Hi Julie,    ok a few suggestions are    write down all the reasons you shouldn't hit your dog, all the negatives, how it would make you feel, how it would make others feel about you, how you may hurt your dog etc- then try to think of a good reason to do it, appart from the fact that it will stop an urge I don't think you will find any.    what about taking a photo of your dog and punching it, i don't highly recomend it but it may help release this urge out of your system in some way.    I am glad you are getting help, i know you have OCD but this is a complusion your going to have to ride out because you can't get away with violence because of OCD and if you cave in on this one what happens if you have an urge to do something worse to another animal or a human? I know your scared of yourself and your actions and I am glad your getting help, i think you should tell your family if you live at home and they will have to try and keep your pet out of the way from you.    I think perhaps you need to sit down with someone and try to figure out what you feel so agressive towards your dog, is it because of the animal or is it anger towards something else?    best of luck to you,i know its not easy for you!  x|`|ygRpxAQMaa	Calm down take a deep breath, you are in control of your own actions. I have ocd too and ive had horrible thoughts One way you could deal with this would be to force yourself to cuddle your dog when you feeling hitting it, so your doing the opposite, or when you get the urge tell your partener to stay with you so you dont do anything and sit with the dog and then resisist, it will be prob the hardest thing ever but the more you do it the easier it will get. dont avoid your dog, this wont help at all, but obviosly dont put it in any danger have someone with you.

The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

Avoid using food, or anything that can break, you wouldn't want to have to explain to your mom why you need to go to the ER.    Some kitchen utensils have very interesting handles, they also clean up easily when your done.
JWEZ4PMKaa	almost everyone has to get spacers... they make room around your back molar for the clasp of the braces to fit around. they dont really hurt as much as they are annoying and itchy, you might even get a little headache from the pressure on your mouth. Same goes for the braces. there really isnt that much actual pain. its more like a dull pain and kinda annoying and ichy. but you get used to it after like three days. the most painful experiance throughout braces is when they tighten the wires periodically. unless you get an expander, that thing made me cry because it hurt so bad.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	Spacers and braces hurt like hell the first week.

But if your teeth are really close together, you're likely to get them. They only hurt for the first couple days or so.

kxyR9e57aa	First of all, please let me offer my condolences to you on the loss of your daughter.  That must have been a difficult ordeal, and you are still grieving her passing.  I'm not sure what doctors don't tell patients about renal cell carcinoma, but we try to tell the patient as much as he or she wants to know.  The cause of renal cell carcinoma is unknown.  The tumors may grow for a long time before they are detected.  The usual way one is detected is as a result of blood in the urine on repeated urinalyses.  Sometimes there may be tumor cells in the urine.  When the cause of blood in the urine is sought, an ultrasound examination or a CT scan usually shows the presence of the tumor.  These tumors spread by growing through the capsule of the kidney and invading adjacent tissues and organs, and they tend to grow into the renal vein and up the vena cava toward the heart.  I have several patients who have had renal cell carcinoma, and I believe most of them are doing well.  One unfortunate patient of mine had a nephrectomy for a renal cell carcinoma, and several years later, developed a second renal cell carcinoma in the opposite kidney.  He was treated with a partial nephrectomy on the second side, and has lately been doing well with no evidence of further tumor involvement.  So whatever causes a renal cell carcinoma on one side may also affect the other side.  Another name for these tumors is hypernephroma.  There is extensive information about kidney tumors in medical textbooks.  A rare type of renal tumor that affects children is a Wilm's tumor, and these can actually be cured with early detection and proper treatment.  Wilm's tumors and renal cell carcinomas are different and should not be confused.  I hope I have given you some of the information you need.  If you have further questions, you are welcome to contact me.
SErhF1OSaa	I don't think you are looking at Schizophrenia, but maybe a Personality type disorder.  I do the same thing kinda, it's like I have 2 sets of friends, etc. and I am one person with one group, then I have a better life that I go to.......it's strange; I am happily married in one sit, and not so happy in the other. I have 4 kids (20, 18, 13, 12) and have a grandbaby on the way; this has not changed how I go about my day to day.  I have been spending so much time in the 'good' life that I have even started to lose weight in both lives. I KNOW is sounds silly, but it is REAL!    I have BiPolar II- rapid cycling, and Borderline Personality Disorder, with Schizo-affective Disorder.

I think this fantasy worl you have created is a way you've found to cope with whats really going on.   You do need to go to the doctor though for a check up.

Good luck :)|`|YO1w7gpiaa	It takes more than a symptom or two to be diagnosed with any one of the psychological disorders, schizophrenia included.    Over a period of time you would be observed and interviewed.  The therapist / psychiatrist would need to see in you a number of symptoms on a sustained basis, and to a critical degree within you.    We all have the capability to display the symptoms you list.  Your diagnosis would depend on matching many other symptoms also.|`|rcZWsfHdaa	My god...Schizophrenia is commonly misinterperited for a multiple personality or as such you are decribing. However, my mental health nurse ALWAYS tells me this: It's hallucinations and thinking you're someone you're not etc!!!!

1BbnyTfBaa	I have lost 65 pounds in the last 13 months and I still have 55 pounds to go.    Here is my method: I used a spreadsheet (but it could be done by hand) to calculate my goal weight every day, so that I would lose 5 pounds per month.  (Subtract 5/30 pound per day.)  Every morning I weigh myself.  If I am over my goal weight, I eat less and exercise more that day.    Here are my weight loss links:    Experts recommend, "Slow and steady weight loss. Depending on your starting weight, experts recommend losing weight at a rate of 1/2 to 2 pounds per week. Weight loss may be faster at the start of a program." http://win.niddk.nih.gov/publications/ch...  And, "Men and very active women may need up to 2,500 calories daily. Other women and inactive men need only about 2,000 calories daily. A safe plan is to eat 300 to 500 fewer calories a day to lose 1 to 2 pounds a week." http://www.fda.gov/opacom/lowlit/weightl...

A healthy exercise program addresses all five aspects of physical fitness: aerobic endurance, muscular endurance, muscular strength, flexibility, and body fat composition.      ---  Exercise Recommendations for People Aged 18 to 64    Do both aerobic activities and strengthening activities.    Aerobic Activities  ? Do at least 10 minutes at a time.  ? You can combine moderate and vigorous activities.  ? Slowly build up the amount of time you do physical activities. The more time you spend, the more health benefits you gain. Aim for exercising twice as long as the minimum times below.   ? If you choose activities at a moderate level, do at least 2 hours and 30 minutes a week.   ? If you choose vigorous activities, do at least 1 hour and 15 minutes a week.    Muscle Strengthening Activities  Do these at least 2 days a week.  ? Include all the major muscle groups such as legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms.  ? Exercises for each muscle group should be repeated 8 to 12 times per session.    From the U.S. Federal government: http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/pdf/a...

Good luck|`|j0JTUiTaaa	Start reading labels.  Look at how much fat, sugar, protein and carbs are in the food.  Before you embark on a weight loss program be sure to talk to your doctor.  Ask them to refer you to a nutritionist for help.  They will help you figure out a diet that will work for you.     The best exercise in the world is free and available to most people.  Walking.  Go to the mall, leave your money in the car and just walk.  Take a bottle of water with you.  Get a pedometer and keep track of your progress.  Set some goals.  See how many steps you average in a week and set a new goal for the following week.  Don't use elevators if you can get by, try the stairs.  They are easier to get on, since most people don't use them and you don't have to stand around waiting for one.    Good luck.

Your BMR is 1726.    You should know, fruits are good for you, but they also have sugar. It's good sugar, but eating too much is like eating very very very healthy candy. Don't cut out fruits, just be cautioned.     Don't snack. If you get hungry, chew gum or drink water. Snacking is what kills during diets. Wear an elastic around your wrist and when you get hungry, snap it. Eat three, solid, healthy meals a day, and drink green tea (which burns calories). Granola bars from stores are usually saturated in sugars and junk so avoid those.     - You should also cut out all white breads and limit that - switch to dark breads if you must eat them.   - If you're having chicken, have grilled, not breaded    Good luck!

That will show you how much you should be eating.    "What type of cereal ?"  Cereal is overrated.  Go for oatmeal + eggs for a healthy breakfast.  "What about Granola bars ?"  Better than chips, but still overrated.  "What type of snacks ? "  Fruits and nuts.  Try to get some trail mix.  Make sure it doesn't have anything extra added.  Btw, if it has M&Ms in it, it's not trail mix, it's dessert.    Eat whole grain foods.  Eat plenty of nuts, beans, skinless boneless chicken, and vegetables.  Drink water and only water.  The only exceptions are skim milk and UNSWEETENED tea.    Stay away from fried foods, foods with hfcs, white foods (ie white rice), and stuff that is greasy.  Diet Soda IS NOT BETTER THAN REGULAR SODA!  It's just as unhealthy.  All the juice that you see advertised is crap.  V8 for example is just a waste of money and it actually not that healthy.    Spread your meals into 5-6 small meals, instead of 3 large meals.

These fractures more commonly occur in the thoracic spine (the middle portion of the spine), especially in the lower part. While osteoporosis is the most common cause, these fractures may also be caused by trauma or metastatic tumors.     The VCF's are usually treated with bed rest, back braces and surgery if required.    You need to see a neurosurgeon who can help you with your condition.

Although others can suggest things that could be the issue, only a doctor who is skilled in medical care could provide an accurate diagnosis.

These kinds of foods give you a lot of acidity, and your body is not ready to handel that after you just had the stomach flu. Altho, I Suggest you go see your doctor, maybe if you have previous stomach problems he or she can perscribe you medication, like a ppi (proton pump inhibator), nexium being one.|`|aEpxcZcaaa	It sometimes takes your stomach awhile to get back to its healthy functions..but eat more vegtibles,and drink a lot of water..that might help..if all else fails go dee a doctor!

gWlmU1KJaa	if my popcorn had a weird disease, I wouldn't eat it    otherwise, cant see why not|`|Q4ggnG0waa	Many people have small pouches in the lining of the colon, or large intestine, that bulge outward through weak spots. Each pouch is called a diverticulum. Multiple pouches are called diverticula. The condition of having diverticula is called diverticulosis. About 10 percent of Americans older than 40 have diverticulosis. The condition becomes more common as people age. About half of all people older than 60 have diverticulosis.  Diverticula are most common in the lower portion of the large intestine, called the sigmoid colon. When the pouches become inflamed, the condition is called diverticulitis. Ten to 25 percent of people with diverticulosis get diverticulitis. Diverticulosis and diverticulitis together are called diverticular disease. No, don't eat popcorn, nuts, seeds, pits, etc.|`|ldpDzaolaa	anything with seeds is not really recommended, I would think the part of the kernel would or could get trapped in the diverticuli and cause diverticulitis. Same as raspberry or strawberry jams or other foods that you should avoid.|`|kxyR9e57aa	I think you mean diverticulosis.  That is the condition in which there are rows of small outpocketings in the wall of the colon, especially the distal colon.  If something gets trapped in the opening of a diverticulum, the result can be an infection in the diverticulum, and that is diverticulitis.  When a person has diverticulosis, physicians generally recommend that person to avoid foods that may have seeds or that pass through in small chunks.  The list includes tomatos, nuts, whole-grain bread, poppy seed buns, popcorn, strawberries, and anything else that might includes particles that might not get digested.  There are generally no symptoms with diverticulosis. It develops in people who have a long history of not eating enough fiber or roughage, and is more common in people with a history of constipation.  Diverticulitis produces left lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, and an elevated white blood cell count.  It is somewhat similar to appendicitis, but on the opposite side.|`|UMGHD2A9aa	Dear Whitebuf,          I believe that if God gave us a certain food to eat in  its  natural form, we should so oblige Him, Don't you think.  But if you must eat popped corn, then do so with the diligence of chewing it very thoroughtly.  Adding some pure vegetable margarine melted on it should help it to diegest more easily down to the intestines where the diverticuli are. Earth Balance is the best one as it has no hydrogenated oil in it so it is easier to digest.   But be careful not to ingest too much at one time.  We can overload  on anything.  That is why one gets the disease in the first place.  Good Luck and God Bless.
eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	My sympathies to you, I have the same exact problem.  My solution is to use Cetaphil lotion, and to apply it each time after I wash my hands and before I put on gloves each time.  I also get a professional manicure every two weeks- at the original suggestion of a dermatologist I had to see for an infection I got from dry, cracked cuticles.  I also super coat my hands with petroleum jelly and put on a pair of cotton gloves, and sit back in a tub to relax and read a magazine while it soaks in- about 15-20 minutes every couple days.  It's helped me, I can't tell you how much.  The fastest remedy I know is to wet your hands, slather on the petroleum jelly, and slap on a pair of gloves.  It will hold in the heat, melt the jelly and lock in the moisture for you.  About 1/2 an hour or so should do the trick for you.|`|iMzIqRzdaa	Get some hand moisturizers / lotions. I recommend brands such as "Olay" and "Cetaphil"|`|ldpDzaolaa	your dentist should be able to obtain a heavy duty grade hand/hosp lostion that stays on. there is something called liquid glove, if no resolution, try a dermatologist, I have Biofine that requires a Rx, but it's for the face, try vaseline wrap tonight with socks. The alcohol nonsoap squirts dry your hands and make them worse, I use regular soap and water and avoid those temp hand washes.|`|95WSkJ74aa	hand moisturizers are good, but old fashioned petroleum jelly more commonly known as vaseline works well too... And it is much cheaper, or if you get some kind of chap stick that you do not get in the stick, like a little container. (that would probably work the best.)     Oh and neosporin on the cuts.    Good Luck, I know it is bothersome, but just live with it now and keep using lotion or vaseline after they heal to keep it from happening again.|`|553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	Use CeraVe cleanser and Moisturizer when you are washing your hands.

Vicodin and Ultram are similar in what they do, and are pain medications. You should not take both, just one or the other. Vicodin has Tylenol in it, so do not take any more Tylenol while you take the Vicodin, if you do end up taking the Vicodin. If your tooth pain is that bad, you should just go see the dentist.
mhLaOFZRaa	This can be serious!! Sounds like you need some blood to build your blood up.    Call your doctors 24 hour telephone number and ask for him to call you back on emergency. Remind him what day you came in for the appointment and what the results of the test were and what your symptoms are now and ask him what you should do.    (OR)    Just go on to the Emergency Room and get them to check you out.    Do you eat meat?   Do you have a very bad diet?   If you are a girl are your periods extremely heavy?  Have you had any bowel problems lately?    I tell you this because my mother in law had the same symptoms and ended up in the Emergency room and had to have 2 pints of blood. Her blood pressure was extremely low. She had been gradually bleeding over time and she had not noticed that she had blood in her bowel movements. She was then found to have colin cancer and had to have surgery.    I am not saying that is what is wrong with you, but since you are still having serious problems you really should call your doctors number and tell him you have an emergency to get him to return your call right away,  or just go to the Emergency room to be checked.

My brother had a tumor in his liver from colon cancer and had surgery and it was a 100% success, but it depends on the patient. I would get a couple of opinions about surgery. I will warn you that many cases cannot be treated surgically. Best wishes to dad and you.

Its due to a spike and drop in the levels of insulin, among other hormones. The best way to keep insulin levels steady is to eat small meals throughout the day, like 6 meals. If you're hungry, it means that you should be eating something although that something does not have to be big. Also, you diet should be made up of about 50% carbs. If you starve your body of a nutrient, it'll think you're starving for everything and will store fat. The only way to lose fat is to provide every nutrient your body needs. That includes protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins etc.     Also a lot of girls think that weight lifting is going to make them huge...its not. I don't really understand what they think will be under the fat once they lose it. Air? Nope, muscle. Nice thighs are muscle. A nice butt is muscle. Abs = muscle. If you're just doing cardio, you should be doing weight lifting as well, if just to tone and burn calories. Don't lose so many calories from your diet and instead eat a balanced diet while burning as many calories as you can, and you will lose fat like crazy.|`|8MTxFbctaa	Maybe you have a thyroid problem?  Also if you work out that much it could be muscle; but at the same time if you're just walking around your neighborhood I wouldn't expect to have a Halle Berry body.    Cardio is your friend. Run! : )|`|CrYc4TTSaa	Eat and eat a lot.  Have some variety, include all parts (carbs prot etc).  The key is to only concentrate on getting enough fiber.  Your body works hard, but you are still getting all you need.|`|W0CrSxtUaa	eat like 8 small meals a day because it helps metabolism|`|701e2d7f00a2115b6c84b87bd5dfce4caa	Your body does go onto starvation mode which means it stores everything as fat to prepare for a famine.  Your best bet is to eat super healthy small meals several times a day.  That way when you are feeding yourself bits at a time your body is constantly digesting kicking your metabolism into overdrive.  Don't worry so much about not eating carbs worry more about the type of carbs you eat.  100% whole wheat carbs makes sure your body has fiber which cleans you out and helps you feel full faster.  You need protein at every meal to make you stay full longer.  Hope this helps :)
