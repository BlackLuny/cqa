20090205124548AATUc4F	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What do I do With a husband who just doesnt get it?	I found out a few months ago my father has cancer so I have tried to spend as much time with my family as possible. Here's the issue, They HATE my husband. (With good reason).  But when I come home from a weekend or evening at my dad's side my husband finds EVERY reason under the sun to be mad at me.  Am I crazy or is this just a really SH@**y time for him to be picking on me?  I have never taken advantage of the situation, only asked for the extra support right now for our son as well as so I can be with my dad.  I don't know how to convince him to just be there for me through a really hard time.  He's been so mean about the stupidest things.  I'm starting to think maybe I just married the wrong man.

20090205124909AAWFsqJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Should my boyfriend help me with the bills, even though i have two children from a previous relationship?	my partner moved almost 100 miles to be with me in april last year. But since they he has contributed almost nothing to the house. The aol, phone bill, rent, shopping ( he will pop to the shop from time to time, n get some milk etc) sky bill, ive paid everything, i have 2 children from a previous relationship also. He is a lovely, moral onest person, and we have never so much as swore at each other, we dont argue, n he truely is the most thoughtful loving partner anyone could hope for. Apart from this one thing, he has a good job, and up until september last year i also had a very good job. But it is seasonal, and i wont be back there until may. So have been claiming benifits foor me and my children since. He is aware of my money troubles, just before xmas my car died, and i have not been able to buy a new one because of all the bills. I wrote him a letter 2 weeks ago explaining that i think its wrong he doesnt contribute anything to the house, and the fact had he of helped me, i would not have used my saving for the bills, and therefore would still have a car.it also said i thought he had taken advantage of my good nature, and that i thought we should split. i chose to write a letter rather than confront him because he is not an arguementive person, the next morning, he had left me a note saying he would find somewhere else to live in that week, and he is still here, we havent spoken about the letters, however, i will not sleep in the same bed as him. Im pregnant at the moment, and am dreading it if we split, because of the baby. Well not just because of the baby but because, i know this money thing makes him sound selfish, but he truely is one of the most thoughtful ppl ive ever met.   Am i being unreasonable?

20090205125335AAjDfbV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why Does My Ex Keep Acting Like This?	My ex and I are 10 years apart he is 27 and I'm 37. We broke up a year ago but we still remain friends and keep in touch.  We were in love once and crazy about each other but things did not work out. For the past year he has had several failed relationships. Since him I have decided to date around and stay out of a relationship. It seems to be healthier for me even though I feel like a loser sometimes because I haven't gotten in a relationship, mostly because I'm afraid of getting my heart broken again. I do feel like because he has had several relationships that he is having "more fun".  Anyways, everytime one of these so called relationships of his fails, he seems to come back around me more often, telling me how he misses what we had, etc.  Why does he keep doing this after each of his breakups? Is it because he realizes he will not find anything better than what he had with me? I don't get it. Please help answer this for me. Thank you

My boyfriend got a little ahead of himself and told me that he was going to propose sometime between Valentine's Day and our anniversary (April 30).    He has hinted about popping the question before the end of this month, but he could also just be telling me all of this to throw me off-guard completely.    We went to pick out my ring together so I know he has been making payments on it.  I just have this gut feeling it won't be too much longer now.  The question is just WHEN!!    What does everyone else think??  Is he going to do it sooner than I think, or is he just stringing me along??

20090205125758AAK1Dto	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	If he sleeps around so much, why did he look like he was jealous?	I met this group of guys the other day and we partied at their house together. I kissed one of them two nights in a row and he wanted to do more, started touching me all over but I took his hands off and left. I really like him but he seems to be a party boy, so I guess it will go nowhere. I found out his other friend thought I was hot, but this guy actually wants a girlfriend and doesn't sleep around. So the next time I went over there, I started flirting with his friend. While we were talking the other guy kept looking at me periodically, but I kinda ignored him. Did this get him jealous? I also found out that he also tried to do something with a random girl the night before but got shot down again, so if he is such a manwhore, why did he look like he was jealous that I was talking to the other guy? Or does he think I am a slut?

It wasnt a mocking kind of laugh, but a friendly laugh. And after that she laughed at just about every thing I said. My friends do laugh a lot when there around me, but she laughed when there was nothing even funny. And then in the following days she was kinda staring at me (i was starring at her too).       Whats the deal here?    Does she like me or what?   Do a lot of girls usually laugh when there's nothing funny if they like somebody?

20090205135517AAVfbGg	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Your opinion on my situation?	I have always been really skeptical about Internet relationships, until recently. I found someone online, and fell in love with him. The problem is, he lives on the west coast and i live on the east coast. He is only 20 and i'm 19 and we're both in college near where we live. He has a part-time job, but is in debt and trying to go to college, so he can't really afford to fly here to see me right now. My parents are extremely overprotective, I live with them, and they would never allow me to fly across the country to meet some one I've never met in person. I do not know when we'll actually be able to meet, but I feel like it won't be for a long time. But I really feel like I love him, we have so much in common and we stay up all night talking, he even worked really hard to cover a song for me that I really like, just because I told him I'd like it. Anyways, that was a long story, but I was wondering if any of you have ever been in a situation similar to mine, and if it ended up working out, or if you think I'm being irrational and wasting my time on something that can't work.
20090205135626AAsrVyf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to deal with a "momzilla"?	The other day, my mom flat-out told my fiance and I not to have my sister at the head table because she has children (despite her being my MOH), and she said that's what everyone in her family would expect me to do.      That ticked me off, but today my sister called me in tears. My mom told her (right in front of her kids, no less), that all her problems were due to her "not being able to close her legs", and then proceeded to say that both children were mistakes. There's been drama between them for years due to the fact that neither of them can put the past aside. I can't deal with being brought in the middle of it anymore, especially because my mom is pretty much guaranteed to bring it to the wedding and possibly even cause a scene. She's already turned her parents (who live out of town & don't see things firsthand) against my sister.      This has gone wayyy too far... i'm not saying my sister is innocent in this, but my mom has gotten seriously out of hand lately and I don't need her ruining my wedding with her drama. It's gotten to the point where I either want to elope or more the wedding 4 hours away to where my fiance's family lives (they would probably be hurt if we eloped and I don't want that!)      Not to mention, my mom has pretty much said that things will be over between her and her boyfriend if he doesn't come to the wedding, and I really don't need her blaming me for that (considering he's been the most important thing in her life since they started dating 3 years ago).... he's never met her parents (and they probably won't approve of him because there's an age difference).       Please help me... don't get me wrong, I love my mother dearly but I don't want to upset her because she'll turn her family against me just like she turned them against my sister :(

I have been freinds with this girl for about half a year.A mutual friend (knowing I was lonely and we both lived near each other) thought we would get on well and should get to know each other. We both agreed this seemed like a good idea so we met up for coffee and had a good chat. She seemed nice but then she text her boyfriend and a few other friends to join us and when they arrived it left me feeling a bit left out. After a few hours I decided to go so she dropped me off at the train station (I live in Widnes, she lives in Bolton ) and I left. I text to say thank you for a lovely time and she replied saying since we were only 40 mins away she would come and visit me very soon. I think she did quite like me and was very complimentary of me to our mutual friend but since then I don't like her behaviour. She never calls or texts unless she wants something,, for example she text me today asking for me to check something up for her on the internet. We arranged to meet in her hometown yesterday but she cancelled saying she had a headache (ridiculous excuse and not plausible). All she needed to do was meet me for about 2 hours for a chat, I was willing to get two trains to come see her! Truth is she doesn't wanna know me, or if she does i'm not important to her. She won't text for a while but when she does should I ignore it?
20060927172852AA8OxjT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The truth about women and men.?	Women, why do you refer to "All men are descusting pigs!"?  When it's really women that are descusting pigs.  What is nasty is sex if practiced wrong.  Women will have sex with pretty much anyone, now that is descusting.  Allowing multiple men to stick their ***** inside you sometimes at the same time or within hours or days of eachother.  Women may keep cleaners houses, but not cleaner bodies.  *** stays inside you for seven days.  If you ask me I would rather have a clean body as apposed to a clean house.

20061001230019AAKAAlY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I crazy - he's wasted $1000s , lied & I still want to stay together(married 23 yrs)?	Aftera failing bus & losing loads of money my husband and i both got good jobs.  I couldn't believe our luck - I thought finally we could make up for lost time.  Then back  in April after my husband told me all the money that had been disappearing from out accout (about $1200/month) he'd been spending on booze & drugs & lately a counsellor he'd found in town (at $80/time-he'd told me it was bus. expenses & would be paid back) Said he didn't know if he loved me or what he wanted. I put it down to depression after losing the bus etc. Things seemed to settle for a while, but he could see his job was finishing then I realised in the last 2 months he's "spent" $3300.   Obviously I'd asked, & once again he promised it was work related.  Well, he fessed up when I told him I wasn't stupid - drugs, booze & I don't know what else. I'm sure there's more to it.  He says he feels like a failure, cant provide etc but he WILL NOT talk to me about it.  We have 2 kids (11 & 15) I'm gutted by the lies

I'm not sure if she likes me the same way i like her though. I've known her since last school year. one of my friends told me she had asked him if i was single one day, then the next day another friend told me a friend of the girl i like was going to give me the girls phone number( i never got it). So unsure on her feelings i wrote her a casual note asking y she had looked sad one day and i also slipped a ? asking for her phone number, i also gave her mine. the next time i saw her she told me she would write me back. that was 2 days ago, still hasn't wrote. she almost always talks to me and smiles at me just about everytime i talk to her. I'm confused on how she feels, i don't want to jump the gun and flat out ask her out, or bluntly ask for her number. Is she testing me or something, help plz cause i'm lost on what to do next, and this school year is my last chance. advice plz.

A girl i know found out someone they are now involved with,( that was in love with me in the past) still thinks he has a thing for me even though i told her nothing is going on anymore. A mutual friend told to me that she vents her anger/jealousy  using answers and then answers question with multiple screen names and signs them with my name or things significant to my family so that when he signs (he uses answers to) on and reads them he thinks it is me to get something started.  I wish to do nothing to hurt this person and wish she knew this. I am not perfectand made mistakes in the past but I just want to move on and wish she would just ask me any questions she might have. I just discovered this sight a month ago by suggestion and try to help people not hurt or belittle them. Do you think I should contact her? Thanks.

I worked really hard to get where i am now and am engaged to a wonderful man which my family dislike. I guess you could say i was always the black sheep of the family as they are very comfortable money wise. I have 3 sisters & 3 brothers and i am the youngest of them. Growing up i rebelled against everything my parents said and never really felt loved. I ended up with a drug problem at 15 until 2 years ago and i have been clean & got my act together and i am so happy. My best male friend and i were both addicts but im the clean one he is still on it despite me trying to help he is my best friend & i dont want to see anything happen to him. My moms good friend is more like a mother to me and her children are like brothers to me also, i confide in her alot. We all grew up together. It should not get to me but it does. How can i get them to accept me into there lives?
20061122101742AALYagQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a big deal?	I know this may sound stupid but...I have this problem with my friend. Whenever I call her, and she's out with her friends we talk for ten seconds and she says, ''I have to go now. Bye.'' That's fine because I know when you're out and shopping you can't talk.       Here's the problem: When me and her are out (say at the gym) and her friends call, she talks with them for 15 minutes and completely ignore me. And after shes done shes like, ''Yeah theyre my friends.'' What bothers me is that when I call her she doesn't want to talk, but when her other friends call, she talks with them for 15 min.       When I try to tell her shes like, ''OMG this is so stupid. I cant believe ur mad over this. Whatever.'' So do you guys think its a big deal and I should just ignore it or should I find new friends? Shes my good friend and I like hanging out with her.

20061222115402AAYJeB2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does it seem like I'm never happy?	could it be the fact that I'm 19 and my boyfriend is 25? or does age not matter? We're about to have a kid in January, and I feel extrememly tied down. Not because of the kid, but because I have a car that I can't even drive, if I go anywhere or talk to anyone i have to have a reason why and everything i say while on the phone, i get interrogated about. I'm not a girl who cheats, I'm not a girl that plays guys, I'm not a girl who would say I'm going here, or I'm doing this, and not be doing it or be there. I lie...but who doesn't, it's never anything about where i am, who i'm with, or what i'm doing, or whatever else in that category...so why is it that my fiance can do whatever he wants and talk to whoever he wants and I not ask because i trust him and he ask me a million and one questions about anything i do? why is it that he calls me amillion times when he leaves the house to see what I'm doing, when there's nothing i can do? why doens't he just trust me and why cant we be happy??

Anyways, when I got to school, my friends started to snicker.  I wondered what was wrong.  At lunch (after 4th period), one of my "friends" said "Annie, you look so stupid.  What did you do, apply your makeup in the dark?"      Me, not realizing my mistake, said "What do you mean?"      My friend said "Look at your eyes, dumbo!" and then she started laughing.      I looked at my eyes and then asked "Why didn't you guys tell me before?"      They started cracking up and said "It was so funny to watch you walking around, looking all stupid."       Then one of my other "friends" said "What are you, retarded?  Wipe it off."        So I try wiping it off, and they all start laughing histerically and saying things such as "You look even stupider now!"  and "The more you wipe, the worse it gets!" until I stop rubbing and stop talking.      What should I do/ say?

20061031093434AAycKR3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend of over a year, repeats pattern of resistence calling when out of town?	It just seems that I'm not one of the first things on his mind when he's out of town. We have had a couple times where he didn't call me for a day or two period, and than came back home. Expecting me to wait here, pick him up at the airport with a smile. If I look at the pattern closely I know he feels pressure when I am hoping or expecting a phone call/txt/ or email. With trust issues in the way, serious disrespect from his end, and still putting up a fight and getting annoyed I txt or call a few times when he's gone is bullsh*t. You know, everything is an arguement, everything is an issue. I've been asking him to pick up the slack, and while he has improved, the real effort matters are not tended to. I even gave him a list of 5 things that would make me happy. One being to communicate with his mother on his feelings for me, where he humliated me to her saying he didn't feel anything almost a year ago.  WOW....      I'm either PMSing bad, or keep feeling grief.

My fiance and I have been together for 3 years and have been living together for the past 4 or so months.  We are currently planning our wedding for next March.  When we first started dating, we discussed moving out west and he was all for this.  I had a job offer this past spring, but he was unable to find a position, so we decided to wait a little while longer.  More recently though, when I bring it up, he is kind of veering away for the idea and I don't know what to do.  He has known from the beginning how I felt about where we currently live and he said he felt the same way.  Recently though I'm not sure what to do because I'm afraid if I stay with him, I'll end up being 'stuck' here.  He claims that won't happen, but I just don't know.  Any ideas???

The first I was crazy about and I told him that I had feelings for him but then he made it clear he didn't feel the same way, but now he's saying he wants me but I don't know if I really want him like that or just a friend because his other exes all hate him. The 2nd my parents hate and so do my friends except a couple but he's so sweet and accepting of who I am he's one of the few guys that I can just take his hand and hold it for hours and he won't even look at me funny. The 3rd is a guy that I've been seeing at different events for the past year. With him I can just talk to him for hours and tell him everything, but I don't know him very well, and I don't see him very often but he said he's going to go to youth group more. Another thing with him is that whenever he sees me he knows he knows me but doesn't know how he does and doesn't remember my name, but we always hit it off. Please help me decide I need help!!!!!!!!!

20061116071507AAtxcV3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I move out of state?	My boyfriend is active military and stationed in another state.  We are talking and would like to live together.  I am nervous about leaving my home and starting over, you know doctors, schools, all of the things I am used to.  We are in a committed serious relationship. He also will be deployed again soon, this summer.  I love the area where he is at and I know that we will be together because we have made it through one deployment already, and even though we are 5 hours drive from each other, we still see each other every weekend he is in the US.  It is getting expensive to travel all the time however. We have an absolute blast together and we were friends way before he did the military thing, but I guess I am wondering if it's going to be hard. Anyone had any experience with this? He will probably continue with deployments, etc., but even though its hard I love this man so much I can't imagine not having him in my life.....any advice?

20061118202351AASS28G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Tell me what my ex-husband want's from me???	We were married for six yrs.  We've been divorced for three yrs. and have a seven yr. old daughter.  For the past year he has called me everyday (almost) and talks to me like we are best friends, we've always managed to be friends.  This past month he's been talking about getting back together.  This week he came over and we had sex and acted like we were married again.  The thing is, I've been through some rough relationships and so has he, and this has left me feeling skeptical.  I wonder does he just want sex or what?  We haven't discussed where this going from here b/c we said we would just see how it works out.  But, I'm wondering if he is playing games on me like the rest of the men have?  I'm just an honest person and I don't like games so instead I'm at the receiving end all the time.

20061120214856AA52YKm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Clarification of facts behind question, "Has anyone in TX ever modified a Preference of Child 12yrs & older? "	I asked this question earlier & someone answered that it depended on the child's age, that some custodial parents "poison pill" the non-custodial parent, & that the court would want to know WHY the child didn't want to visit the other parent. To clarify this situation, the child is 15 & the non-custodial parent is the one "poison-pilling" themself. Our child has sent documentation of this along with attempts to speak with & to correspond with said parent, who literally ignored it all, to our attorney who has spoken to a judge about this situation already. Our attorney completely agrees that the child has plenty of reason for not wanting to visit & the courts do know. As for us, we have done everything within our power to resolve this & have made it clear that we are here for BOTH our child AND the other parent. We want nothing more that to see this resolved, but we're dealing with borderline emotional & mental abuse & have an obligation to protect in every way possible. Hope this help

He and his ex-wife and I finally get along and I get to see him usually once a week and my fiance sees him a few times a week. His ex and i talk over myspace a few times a week and we're always exchanging pictures we've taken of baby and daddy together so the whole relationship is good. There won't be any family or friends at our wedding, since we're getting married 300 miles from home and nobody can travel that far. Should I include a children's vow? I just recently heard about them and was wanting some good suggestions on wording...our regualar vows and ring vows we've already picked out and the wording is more young and contemporary, not traditional. Any ideas?

20061212132952AABsygw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	FOR LADIES: A complicated issue. Please read below and offer any good advice. Thanks.?	I've known this girl since freshman year of college (about 4 years), we've always hung out together, never really gotten together. For about three months now we've been going out and things are going really well, she's everything that I want in a girl. In January I am going to start a new job about 5-6 hour drive away from where I go to school. She graduates in May and will move to the same city. I've told her that I really want to keep things going, (as we will only be living apart for about 5 months) but deep down I don't think she believes me (she dated an a$$hole before me that treated her really bad and I think that she really got hurt in the whole thing and she is a little hesitant to committ.) I haven't ever cheated on a girl in my life, and I want to let her know that I want to give it a serious try between us. How should I tell/prove it to her? Thanks for the advice.

I am the oldest stepson.  My half brother and I have the same father.  My stepsister and half brother have the same mother.  My stepsister and half brother are in the will and on the checking account.  My stepsister has been spending money like it is going out of style.  She offered a year and a half ago to split everything four ways.   My sister and I are the stepchildren.  My stepsister has been out of state for 25 years.  About a month ago my stepmother had me store her bed at my house.  She told me to take good care of it and I told her I would and I am.  My stepsister hasn't talked to me since Monday.  She called today wanting the bed.  I haven't asked about the will or the money or anything.  I want to keep the bed because it is all I may have to remember my stepmother by.  She told me to take care of it after all.  Should I give the bed back and be screwed out of everything?

So i guess i can start. I have a problem with my fiancee. The thing is that i'm madly in love with her, and she loves me too, but she is a total shrew. Last times we are quarreling all the time, and it gets  on my nerves. I do everything what she wants, just because i want to please her, and make her feel as my equal, but she became rude. She considers herself to be a boss in the family. I tried talking with her, but all she says is that i create aproblem which does not exist. I even talked with her friends, and one of them told me that she needed a real man.Well i behave with her like a real man in terms of respect, but i guess she wants different relationships. She always changes the topic when i try talking about it. I do not know what to do. maybe i should try spanking her or smth.like that. Sorry but i do not know what to do! :(

20090205141627AAUSpqJ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need help with my girlfriend. I dont know what to do??? Help please.?	ok so me and my girlfriend, im going to call her sam, have been dating for around 7 months. we have had a great relationship and i want to keep it that way... she told me a few days ago that she was thinking about taking a break, and when i asked her why, she said that she might like someone else. she wont tell me who it is. but we talked and we ended up not taking a break. well the reason why she thought it was because she had a dream about kissing this mysterious guy. so sam told me and she is crying and saying she loves me and that she doesnt want to break up with me. and sam has self esteem issues because of her mom. then i started guessing people and the only person i care if she liked them or not is my best friend zak. and i said it better not be zak and sam said it is not zak.... so  i believed her because i dont think she would lie.  a couple of days pass and then today i herd her talking to her friend about sending her a message on myspace. and i assumed it was about the whole dreaming about kissing another guy and might liking them. well the whole day goes on and when i get home i decided to check what the message says because i know her myspace password. and it said that it was zak and she feels bad because it is. and all of this stuff about how she doesnt want to but she cant resist herself.and that the dream was about my friend zak.    i know that is a terrible thing to do and now i deeply regret it.   so when i picked her up today i said to her that i knew it was him because all of the clues led to him and sam denied it all... and then got super mad about me thinking it was my best friend. when i read the message that said it was...   i never told her i looked at her myspace.    but i want to know should i tell her i looked at it?    should i break up with her?   how do i handle this? she told me that she wont tell me who it is until our 1 year anniversary thingy. Will she just lie to me again at our 1 year? and make up a random person?   i would like to know how you would handle the situation

20090205150555AA2wgnn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Did your partner leave someone to be with you?	I met someone a few months ago and we became good friends. We didn't like each other in "that way" at first, but feelings grew and we said we wanted to be together. He said he will leave his girlfriend because he has nothing in common with her and she always questions everything he does and also says they've been unhappy for a while. He doesn't have a bad reputation with women and we spend lots of time together, talking and making each other laugh. He isn't using me for physical stuff. I know that because we haven't done anything we shouldn't have. I won't allow that until he breaks up with her and we can be together properly. However its been a few weeks and he still hasn't got rid of her. Am I being a fool by waiting for him?
20090205151055AAVuqFl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He left me and now I can't carry on?	So recently I've been dating this guy. I felt an immediate connection with him. Things were going well with us for about 3 months. I learned early on that he was really on again off again with me, one minute he would say he wanted to be with me for sure, the next he said lets just take things slow. And any time I backed off hed come back and chase me. I thought things were really good and everything , until he started freaking out and saying that we were " just friends". But then when we spent time together it wouldnt be like that and he'd say he takes it back. That he had a lot of feelings for me and wanted to see where things went for the longterm. The last 2 weeks, I was really upset with how he'd been acting and I said I needed sometime to think about things, and maybe we should have some time apart. This did NOT go over well, I tried calling him in this period, just to keep the communication but he would have none of it. Turns out I find out this week, he sends me in a text that I need to move on with things and That hes seeing someone he "really likes" and he hopes I do the same thing. What makes him think he can do this and why would he?? I found out through a friend he truly is seeing someone and has been for the past month, while I thought we were together. So things I guess are going good with this new girl. I'm just so upset I hope he likes her way more..and I just hope he doesnt do this to her. What the hell did I do that I'm not good enough and he chose her over me? The pain is too much to deal with I just want to die, I was VERY connected to him. I guess he doesnt' even miss me. The rejection is just killing me, and I dont really want to live right now, thinking about him kissing some other girl. His sister says this is some kind of pattern he has done in the past. hes cheated on girls and never settles for long
20090205151459AAMIxte	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What is going on with him?	I asked this question before, but the whole killing himself thing is freaking me out, so I was hoping for even more input. I'm thinking he's just trying to sidetrack me again.   So my husband cheated for a year with girl at work. Had an emotional AND physical relationship with her. He denied it forever, then I catch him. Long story short, he says he can't believe what he did and wants his life back. Says he doesn't talk to her at all anymore. There is no way of me knowing that. Last few weeks, certain things arent' adding up again. Not anything big, but small things that could have an explanation (just like before). I spent the last week, upset alot and making him answer to lots of questions and expecting lots of reassurance. Last night we kind of got heated into the conversation and he kind of freaked out. He said he was going to kill himself and even did and said a couple things that kind of scared me that he actually would. He said he was white trash and didn't deserve me. Holy cow. Been with him over 11 years and have never seen anything like that. He said he tries and tries to prove himself to me and it's just not enough. Holy cow, he's been lying to me like crazy and trashing me for a year. Should I just be over it in 2 months. Does it sound like he is still cheating and just trying to get me off his back, or could he be sincere? I don't know what to do now.      Oh yah, so today, I just told him how much I loved him and asked no questions and he came home early from work and we just laid in bed watching TV. He also said last night that it was destroying him how much he hurt me. My private investigator told me that many men in this situation self destruct. Is that what's happening. And I don't have any more money to give my investiagtor so I can't use him to see if the affair is continuing

20090205153943AAN0gh4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy obsessed?	I work in a mental institution for people with mild mental health issues. I have been working there a year now. When I first started there I was asked to co-work a 28 year old male. He appeared to be this very depressed man. Any way after a month of me helping him he become really happy and did allot more. I then started to to notice that he would get very jealous when I was around male staff and male clients, and he was watching everything i was doing. i was moved of him as a co-worker and moved downstairs. It still is the same even though I don't see as much of him, It like when I go out for a fag he goes out, and like when Im around other people he looks so angry and he will play up for the care staff on his floor due to this. I dint think he understands that we cant have a relationship.

20070129222909AAJrXDi	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do to my friends? As a friend...?	He is my close friend and lately he has been in difficulty, but one of the major difficulties is his application for scholarship is rejected. As a close friend of his, I feel obliged to help him in any way. Because if he doesn't get the scholarship, he'll quit from this university because he is not rich enough to afford his studies. However, what makes me feel sad and useless is when I just realized that I can't do anything to help him, except for moral support. We are close friends and I should do more than just moral support.       My question is that, if you are in my position, what would you do? Will you accept the fact that you can't do anything? Or maybe you will do something beyond your control? I don't want him go...

I asked him on Monday and the answer he gave me was that "I have to check what i'm doing this weekend and i'll let you know". Well he didn't tell me today and the dance is on Friday, I know, shame on me for asking on such short notice but whatever. I interpret his answer as a no, especially since he didn't tell me anything today, even though he clearly had many chances to. What do you think?

20090205154216AAXxOmH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help with a girl...?	Alright, theres this chick in my physics class that i really like. the weird thing is the fact that i thought she was a nerd, til she came back with a rebel personality and looking a lot better. Nd im a rebel. im in an advanced ap physics class and im a total wise ***. the trouble is that i dont know if she likes me and i kinda want to ask her out on a date to get to talk to her. i would talk to her and flirt with her during physics class but she sits at the other end of the class. If she does not like me that would make it wierd and akward, and i would feel like a dumb *ss because i got rejected. never been rejected b4. So, should i ask for her phone number or ask her on a date to get to know her. I just think its kinda weird asking her without flirting with her a lot.      Oh it helps im in 11th grade and fairly attractive.

20090205153804AAC6lh9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she interested, or know that I love her?	Although I have never asked, I've always got mixed signals about my friend being bi-sexual. On her FB it says she is interested in both men and women (as friends or partners, I'm not sure), and once told me that after we win the lottery we should share a bed. She's had boyfriends before, so I'm not sure. I told her that I love her (I've known her for years) and she replied "Awwwwwwwwww. I love you too". Is she just being friendly, or do you think she "loves-loves" me? I told her once that I loved her personality and she started in on me coming to visit her. We live hours away.      I am getting her a diamond accent pendant for her birthday (its just one of a little cat), and it is on its way to her. i've really struggled with depression, but just talking to her always makes me so good :)      I would tell her that I like her but I don't want to scare her away.

My mom is getting married (my parents were married 27 years, got divorced last year right after I left for college, has been with the guy for I think a year; they are moving into the house that I grew up in and my dad got an apartment in the city). She asked me to be the maid of honor. (not looking too forward to all of it). I have a few questions:         1. I am a POOR college student but I guess I should throw a bridal shower. Right? What can I do to make it nice and inexpensive?   2. If they are getting married a year from now (Jan '10), when should I have the shower?   3. Would it be in bad taste to have it at their house since I live at school, so it is my home, and having at a place would probably be too expensive.      Thanks! any ideas for the shower would be amazingg.      (PS my grandmom and aunt... mom's sister... will probably offer to help but I don't want to lean on them too much)

20090205152157AAaoRtW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Time to end the relationship?	Well, I'm engaged to a woman who is driving me nuts. We've been together over two years, and the first year was great. The second year, not so much.      Right now, I am constantly accused of cheating on her, which she knows I'm not doing. She also attacks my self esteem over the phone, telling me I'm lazy, unambitious and basically no good. I can't even stand talking to her, I just shut down.      She also demands that I get baptized before the marriage and slams single parents, when she knows I was raised without a dad in the house.      She also tells me that I'm going to owe her lots of money if I break up with her and sent me a list of stuff I owe her. This stuff includes a curtain, a carafe she pushed me into which broke and gas of all things.      I still love her, but I don't feel comfortable around her at all. I feel if I break up, things will be made worse and my life will be turned into a living hell.

20090205152923AAc4Uw5	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do about this friendship?	My friend and I say we're best friends but i don't feel like its true. It seem i put more into the friendship than her. I have to start everything, talking planning everything basically..she tells me shes not the type to start things. And when i do ask her to hang out she can sometimes but she'll never come to my house. I always have to go to hers. She says she trys to hang out as much as she can but i always find out some how that she's doing something other than what she said she was doing. Her priorities she says is her family and shool. That's not a bad thing but i would think that since we're such good friends i would be in some part of her priorities. She says i don't accept her as she is but i feel i do, all i ever ask of her is time to hang out. Im going in the navy in two weeks and still she ditches me.Shes known for a long time about me leaving. And i just found out that just recently shes going with her cousin to look at a college, the week before i leave. When she told me will find some way to hang out before i leave, cause school is her life. Im just confused, cause she never shows emotion.      And no im not stalking, or smothering her.I always say to her dont let me bother you then, she says if it bothered her she'd tell me. Ill see her maybe once in a while. Cuase its up to me to start everything she says. And i get tired of having to plan everything. A few weeks ago i just stopped talking to her to see if she would start up the converstaions and nothing.

20090205154009AA1jwqc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHY does it feel like he TRYING TO MAKE ME JEALOUS of his relationship?	My ex ended it with me. (in a rather IMMATURE way, he just disappeared) anyway. It was because he found someone closure to him @ his college. Anyway. He sent me a message explaining. NOw he keeps sending me messages saying "UPDATE" and etc.      It feels like he's just trying to show off or make me jealous? or make me see her?? what the f*ck... I never reply
20090205154025AABaMgR	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am i being emotionally abused and what should i do?	i'm not looking for attention are anything, i just need some advice.    My husband and i have been married for almost a year now.  We had been dating for 4 years and last year, around this time, i broke up with him.  For those 4 years, he had always said that i was cheating on him when i went to work and that is why he never came to my work because he didn't want to see what was going on.  So i stopped working and started working at home and with him.  I became a body piercer so i could work with him.  I had family members get ill and decided to move back home because i wanted to be close to family.  things were ok, but anytime i went on a job interview he would say, say hi to your boyfriend for me.  that just got on my nerves.  I was going to a job interview for christ sakes.  So then the final straw was when i was going to a cocktail for my grandmother who had just gotten out of the hospital.  I got dressed up for it and he said that my family was trying to get me together with this other guy.  I said i was going to a cocktail party.  You're supposed to dress nice.  And an argument broke out.  That night i came home, packe dup my stuff and left.  During the time that we were apart, i slept with another man.  I wish i wouldn't have, but i did and i can't change that.  We got back together a month later.  I didn't tell him right away about the guy because i knew he would be upset.  So we decided to get married and drove out to california to see some friends and then head to Las Vegas to get married.  On the drive out there i told him about the other guy.  He did get upset.  And we had a huge argument up until we got married.  That day was great.  During the arguments i said things i shouldn't have, but i did and i can't take those things back.  things physically about him.  I know that was very unthoughtful of me, but i was just so angry at him that i just started saying things.  Plus he asked me for the truth and i told him the truth.  Now to present day.  For the last year, he has brought up everything i have said and did.  He says that i showed him how much i love him.  I don't understand it.  He expects me to leave him all the time.  He thinks that I will cheat on him and thinks that what i did was cheating.  We were broken up.  Also he had tried to sleep with two other women while we were apart, what's the difference?  I have apologized sincerely many times.  I wish i could change things that i did and said, but i can't.  I just don't know what to do anymore.  Is it worth me staying to see if he will not bring it up anymore?  It's weird because he will be fine one day and not the next.  I never know.  He always wants me with him even when he's at work and i am off and want to be at home.  when i get off of work, I go up to where he works and i sit there until he's off.  Even though i'm tired and just want to go home.  He wants me to work at certain places and not at others.  Like a just recently job an offer to work at AT&T and he didn't want me working there.  He wants me to work at this telemarketing place close to home.  Also he makes these comments all the time about me going out and sleeping with someone else that can truly make me happy.  He has even threatened suicide a few times.  I just don't know what to say anymore or what do to.  And we he starts talking about these things, i just try not to listen and he will just go on and on.  He really only does it at night when we are going to bed.  And then i am up all night or he ends up sleeping on the couch.  I'm just so stressed out and i'm only 23.  He also has 5 kids and i don't know any other woman that would deal with that.  I have been supportive of everything that he has ever wanted to do.  And then he says he can't live without me and that he loves me so much and i don't know whether it's to get to stay or to try and control me.  Then he will say he is so lucky to have me, but i think that if he really loved me, he wouldn't bring up the past and try and move on.  He has told me that it will never change.  He can't change the way his mind works.  I have mentioned counseling, and he just says no.  What should i do?  Should i stick it out longer and see what happens, or should i just go?  Any advice would be great........

20090205123123AAgrZHe	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would you give me some advice please?	Since my husband works every night from Tuesday to Saturday, that only leaves Sunday and Monday for us in the evenings.   We sleep in the same bed on those two nights.  The other nights he sleeps in the guest room, so he can rest without being disturbed.   I have asked before about what is the right amount of space in a relationship... even asked for advice about him going out to clubs when he's not working... under the idea that he's "promoting" or going out to be "seen"      With all this said, Am I wrong to feel neglected, jealous or even depressed about my situation?     I am in a period of deeply analyzing my situation and working through all this.  We have a son that we both care about deeply, and it feels as if we are not moving our separate ways for a reason.  I'm trying to figure this out.  so, just comment.. words of wisdom.. anything really.....  I appreciate it.  Thanks!

20090205140406AAW1E6o	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How do I get over my obsession with weddings?	I have overly obsessed with weddings. Many times a day I see something and think I either want that color at my wedding or it makes me think of something to add to my wedding. I have my colors picked out, my dress, the location, yet I'm not engaged. I don't even have a boyfriend. I know it's normal for girls to pre-plan a wedding, but I think about it all the time. I just want to get married. I know I can be a good wife, and I'm ready to live my life for someone else. I have a cousin who is the same age as me, who was married 2 years ago. His wedding pics are beautiful, and everytime I look at them, I get sad and wish I had some. I'm not stupid though, I'm not about to go marry some stranger, but I'm just wondering if other girls feel this way. Especially when they have friends/cousins getting married and having babies. It's not affecting my life, I'm still able to work and socialize, but I just want to plan my wedding the man of my dreams. Am I totally out there, or what? My friends said I should be a wedding planner if I love them that much. How does one get started with that?

Before only I had phoned to the girl and told her that I will not be eating any tiffin in her house. I had told her that I will have only coffee. I went to see the girl in her house. The girl's mother gave me a cup of coffee. I liked the coffee. I requested to have another cup of coffee.  I spoke with the girl and the girl's mother. Then I touched the girl's mother's feet and took her blessings. Later I came to know that the girl did not like to get married to me. Well, atleast I happy that the girl's mother gave me two cups of coffee. Then I decided that any good person who buys coffee for me is my friend. Second time I went to see another girl for marriage. This time I ate tiffin and drank coffee in the girl's house. The girl's relative repeatedly phoned to our house and asked what I have decided.

I have a different side than wrestling, football season, and reptiles though when I show my side that has my love, no0o0o0one takes me serious, though I am.  Am i changing myself for her? She says she loves when I kiss and hug her, though everyone else says "you do this and that too much she probably feels uncomfortable." Is their a limit were most girls get weird feeling. I also like buying her stuff that she want's (she doesn't ask me, I know she'd like it). Am I ok? Am I changing myself for her? Am I taking this to serious? I love her sooo much and I only want the best for her.   Thanks and remember, best answer=10 points   Nick

20070227142415AAaxjEf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Question about roommate.... and her bf?	My sister lives with two other girls in a 2 bedroom house. One of her roommates (roommate X) has a boyfriend who stays at their house 5-6 nights a week. My sis doesn't mind him being there except for one thing. He takes long showers (sometimes up to an hour long). Then there's no hot water left for her or the other roommate (roommate Y). I think she has the right to either ask roommate X's boyfriend not to take showers their or for both roommate X and her boyfriend to cut their showers down.       She comes over to my house to take a shower! I've been to her house and there really is no hot water left. It was never a problem before roommate X's bf started coming by. She's afraid that confronting roommate X and her bf will just cause tension. What do you think?

20070302025012AAwL3It	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend has cheated on me. How to forgive her?	Hello. This Monday I have found out that my girlfriend of eight years has cheated on me twice last week and has been lying for about almost two months before that. I suspected that it would happen, tried to be as nice as possible to her, was hoping that she would not do it, but she did. Now I have found out and she says that she is sorry and it would never happen again. I am very sad and somethings been broken but I still want to forgive her and go on, but it's very hard. I keep telling myself that she's only human and humans make mistakes and can learn from it but it still hurts like hell. The worse part is that I knew that she was planning to cheat on me for a long time and even tho I knew it and told her, she still lied all the time about it and then, last thursday, when she told me she was going to stay with a girlfriend over night and I believed her (my fault), she drove 100 miles to meat someone and cheat on me. Do you have any tips for me? Best regards, Chris

I moved out of the country for a while but since kindergarten even if i was here before I still never saw him again. Untill yesterday.. I recently moved back to the country, and it is like such a huge coincidence i changed to another school and  we have a class together! and well he kept looking at me all the time as if he remembered me, i asked him today if he did (by the way now i'm 16)he said he didn't. yesterday before i even told him anything about us being  together in kindergarten, he asked my age and where i lived... today he still kept looking at me a lot, less than before though maybe because he noticed i was looking at him a lot too, so its like a if he/she sees you are looking at her immediately turn back situation* and he even called my name in the class when the teacher asked him to call someone else to say what they wrote which really surprised me I didn't know he would know my name after one day (plus i hadnt yet told him about the kindergarten at this time). anyhow, the question is do you think he likes me? i obviously do lol. how can i find out see if he does? or what do i have to look for or do to see if he likes me?

20090205123753AAL2jhN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why Did My Ex-Boyfriend Do This 2 Me?	I have alot of unresolved marital problems and I ended up having an emotional affair with my ex for a couple of months. It just happened. It's not like I was looking for an affair. The affair ended when we were arguing constantly and that my ex has anger issues. I know you're gonna say he's an ex for a reason. We both moved on since then. And then just today he emails me saying that he met someone else who's a nice girl, who's a virgin and he and this girl went on several dates and they hit it off great. He said he just wants to be happy and that he'll keep praying for me (I asked him to stop praying for me. I don't know why he doesn't listen). I wish he didn't have to tell me about him and this girl. I was fine when we weren't communicating. Now I'm jealous and depressed all over again. I want to reply to his email but I don't know what to say to him.   How do I move on?

20090205132741AAe44Ac	Family & Relationships;Family	Ladies, how to move on?	I'm talking about women who came from single families. My dad left when I was really young. So it's been always been me, my mom, and my brother. I'm 22 this year and my mom still wouldn't let me have a life. She doesn't like me dating and wants me to stay with her for the rest of her life. She is even blunt about it too. She gets mad when I talk about my future and where I want to be like having a good job and living with my future husband. Is this normal? Has there any women out there that had to deal with this? My brother is 30 and is just starting to have a girlfriend and my mom is already trying to stop it because she wants his fate to be the same as mine. She wouldn't let him move out. What should I do? If I be a good daughter, then I give up my life. But everyone would say I'm a bad daughter if I leave my mom and try to start my life. Thanks ladies if you could help me out.

20090205121649AAbmVwt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Any ideas on how to have this party?	The party would be a passion/tattoo/male entertainment party for men and women. The passion and entertainment for the women, and the tattoos for the men.      Passion: A representative comes to the location of the party and display/sells what ever product you can find in an adult store.      Tattoo: You would be able to go to a separate section of the party that would be closed off to get a tattoo of your choice (men & women).      Male Entertainment: "That's self explanatory"          The thing is there are a few of my church members who want to come, but only want to participate in the passion side. There are others who are not in the church who wants all 3. Last, there are a few church members who said they know how to leave when they don't want to participate in something because they would not want to be the reason why everyone can't come and participate in the section they want to.      Before you judge a lot of the church women are married just trying to spice up their marriage, and that's allowed.      How do you fix this so everyone can be on the same page?

20090205120522AAWNkli	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can someone help me with this please?????????  I dont understand this guy!!!?	back in nov this guy messaged me on myspace, and we talked here and there (i thought he was obnoxious, he was cocky, arrogant and im a ny giants fan and hes a dallas cowboys fan...arch rivials...so he was talking smack, which i found to be quite annoying and rude ) we talked for some time online and he wanted to meet me...i kept saying no, after a month of not taking no for an answer..... i finally caved. we met, and hit it off.   he seemed very much into me....calling me every chance he got and texting me as well. during xmas (2 wks after we met) in so many words wanted to be invited to our familyxmas party (i told him my whole fam would be there like 30ppl and he didnt care). we even spent newyears together... things went fine from there, hanging out anywhere from 1-3xs a week (hed make plans a lot with me, but id ask him out too and he never declined)...still calling me every day (sometimes several times a day) and texting me like crazy. when we together he is very big on PDA's always holding my hand, hugging me or kissing me here and there. seems very much into me. he keeps talkin about valentines day and how he has this special thing planned for me and whatnot.   ive talked to him about being exclusive and he keeps telling me hes not ready   but   also isnt seeing anyone else nor is he looking for anyone else   ive met a lot of his friends, met his family, etc. he even has a pic of us on his cell phone wallpaper   but yet, he doesnt want to be exclusive. idk   if we're watching tv, he insists on snuggling with me...always.   we've been together for almost 2 months now. he still calls me every day (i never call 1st, cos he always beats me to it) and is always texting me.   i feel like we are a couple just cos of the way were are and stuff.   one night out to dinner his friend called, and he said "i cant talk now ill call u back im out with my girl"   MY GIRL (makes u think he wants to be exclusive or considers me that way)   last night we were talking online and my guy friend (who now lives in florida) wants to move back to NJ but lost touch with a lot of ppl here except me, wants to try to get a place with me...i asked my "bf" how he felt about that...it didnt phase him the least bit, when i asked how come (cos i thought that was weird) hes like "A. we;re not official and B. i know u like me"   which opened a whole new can of worms, i was like well u do this and do that(meaning the way he is with me shows me different), whats the big deal about being exclusive....hes like im not ready...but theres no one else and im not looking for anyone else (well doesnt that mean if youre not looking for anyone else, u just want to be with that one person, hence "exclusive")   im like will u ever be ready (cos at this point im getting mad, cos either u wanna be with someone or u dont) and quite frankly i dont want to wait around forever. i hate games.   and hes like we'll see around valentine's day how the night goes, trust me, thats when i think we be official (pretty much the exact words he said).   im like what? if youre not ready now, what makes u think by then you will be. and hes just like idont know...trust me.   then later we talked again and he was like "i dont wanna hurt u or have me get hurt" im like why do u think im gonna hurt u, im not going to do that, not on my to do list (and hes like ive heard that before)....im guessing from his ex. idk. his ex who he was madly in love with broke his heart, leaving him for another guy.  (and he's told me he had a hard time getting over her and that, that is..............until he met me...he said, and i quote.....im the first person he's met since his ex, that has gotten his mind off of her and has made him happy)   so back on track here..... im like i have no intentions of hurting u.(the only time ive ever broken up with any guys is if they've done me wrong, and ive never cheated and dont plan on starting now)   then hes like i feel like we've rushed things   (im like well, you invited yourself over to meet my fam after 2 weeks during our xmas party, u the one that says u can see yourself falling in love with me in a few months...yes he said that to me like a month ago.......)   his reply "this is true, that still all can happen"  and he keeps saying "nothing's gonna change with us" (meaning for the worst....hes like im not leaving u, and dont plan on it)   so im confused. i keep getting mixed signals   he called me later that night (again) and was like he "misses the challenge of things" when we first met i wasnt very susceptible to things...and he liked that. now its been 2 months and im comfortable and i guess he misses the challenge.   but he keeps saying "no worries, im not going anywhere, i like spending time with you, youre great, im very into you" blah blah blah.   then brings up vday again. like we'll see then...trust me   idk   then after we hung up (i usually text right after and say "kisssss") i didnt do it that time....but 20secs after we hung up i get a text from him and hes l

20090205132459AAAxPJl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	***PLEASE ANSWER!!!! What's the REAL reason my EX wants to see me!!!!?????****?	was on msn last Monday and my ex-bf said hi to me. It was Chinese new year so he said happy new year! Then he said "Hope you stay beautiful forever" What does it really mean? He also said he wants to have dinner with me...He said he wants to see me and we both agreed that next week is a better time for us both. Then he asked for my number on Monday and said he would call me in later on this week. I gave my cell # & told him that it doesn’t have caller ID, so if I miss it to try again another time or to text me. This week Monday, one week later, I got a text from someone saying"hey wats ur schedule like". I asked who it was was, he replied, it was my ex indeed. I said "oh haha we can talk later...".    I went on msn to talk to him instead of texting back. I kinda don’t wanna see him cuz I know how he is, we met up once before, it went bad. Neways on msn, I asked him first when was good, he said this week was bad, but the following Friday is good. I said I’ll be busy. Then he said “haha, why is it so hard to see you?” I said “why do u wanna see me? He said “cuz I miss u?” Why did he put a QUESTION MARK at the end? He's not sure if he misses me?? Then I told him the truth how I kinda don’t wanna see him. That I do but I don’t. Was it MEAN of me to say the truth, is he hurt now?? I asked if he really wants to see me, he said “I do, why else would I ask”. Then I said maybe to the Friday date but for him to ask me again. He said he will. At the end, I said “One more thing, you’ll have to try harder if u wanna see me hehe :P”. At on epoint the chat he even asked me “Next week is Valentine’s day, do u have a date?” I didn’t reply to that, WHY did he ask me that??? Based on the conversation would he say he likes me, has feelings and really wants to see me? Was it bad of me to be honest with him? I went on msn today (3 days after the chat) and he didn’t even say hi, if he REALLY misses me & wants to see me shouldn’t he try more, like talking to me, on msn or phone?? What’s the REAL reason he wants to see me? Just to see me, or does he wanna date again? Should I ask him if he wants to try again? He’s sending mixed messages and its confusing me!!!   BTW we never had sex while dating cuz he knew I wanna save it for marriage, so don't he wants sex.

20090205112222AAMnedG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This question is JUST for the married ladies!?	Especially the stay at home moms. Why is it that when the husband works and the wife stays home to take care of the kids and the home, the man acts like he's somehow above his wife? Like he deserves more respect, and has no obligation to return the same common courtesy and respect that he demands? I'm sure they're not all like that, but I also know that I can't be the only one. To be fair, it's not always like that... But it's like that enough for me to have strong feelings of resentment and almost hate sometimes. Is it possible to love someone and feel hatred for them at times too? My husband says respect is earned (implying that I do not earn it), but how am I supposed to respect him when I feel I get no respect? It's a two way street. Everyone has the right to be frustrated sometimes, but that's no excuse to talk down to or belittle someone you are supposed to love and be equal to. Am I the only one who is going through this?

20090205123713AAH1yQr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice with girls? plz?	alright..Hes some back round info: I'm a sophomore in highschool I'm tall( not ridiculously tall), musclebound ( got an 8-pack, pecs, whole 9--yards), and good looking ( i don't mean to sound cocky, even though i probably do) but I'm pretty shy. There is this girl right she is drop dead gorgeous and really nice, we really don' t hang out much, outside of school, but we have common friends. I like her a lot like when i see her like i forget to breath, my hearts skips a beat, i know it sounds corny, but its true, I've talked to her a couple times, and i think she likes me back, or at least attracted to me, when we see each other in the halls she gives me the whole look up down thing, or we just make eye contact and smile, and say high to each other. However she has a boyfriend who is a senior, and he is a real asshole, and doesn't treat her the way she should be treated. I have no problem waiting for them to break up ( They have before, but got back together like a week later), and i know to give her some time once they do.         Can anyone give me any advice, or some conversation starters to help me with talking to her more, and getting to know her better?      Thanks in advance

20090205124104AAdkCL6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Advice/ opinions on marriage and the military?	I'm sorry if this gets too long, I'll try to make it short:      a few months ago I was thinking about joining the air force, i have been taking classes for a long time and it was something i always wanted to try. my bf got really upset b/c i was thinking about it and was leaving him, he thought i should have talked to him before i even considered it. as it turns out i have a medical problem with my back and they won't take me anyway, but...      now he has said twice in the past few weeks that if he gets laid off from his job hes going into the military. i have tried to ask him why, and how its different if he just goes but i was supposed to discuss it first with him. additionally, we had friends over a few weeks ago and he mentioned to my gal friend that the reason he hasn't proposed to me is b/c rings are so expensive. backtracking a little, when i was thinking about the air force he was totally not ready for getting married.       so here are the "facts": i am 23, he is 21, we have lived together for 4 months, we have been together 6, i know that seems kind of fast but we love each other and i guess when you know you know, i have my associates degree, and i was just let go from my full time job, i have managed to get a part time job. he has a good full time job but its in a factory making car parts and they have been having layoffs every 2-3 weeks, hes afraid his plant will be closing soon. i am taking classes part time and working toward my BS, he has been to school a year and not done well, took a year off, went back last semester and didn't do well. he wants to go back to school but is afraid he is going to fail again.       i think joining the military would be good for him, to help with the education, and i fully support him. i have told him that, but i feel like we need to have an open conversation about what he really wants. I am open to a long distance relationship or getting married to stay together, as far as a ring goes i would wear a quarter machine ring. i know hes concerned about leaving his family, and i think he should look in to the national guard,there i a stationing place close to where we live. i think we need to tale but as i have tried to start this discussion with "why can you join the military but i can't..." and "are you really going to join the military if you get laid off?" and both times i get idk. i just don't know what to say to start this conversation with out making him upset.

My mom and step father a very well off,  they bought my older brother a car last year,(he doesn't work or go to school btw), they go on "shopping sprees" everyweekend, eat out every night, go on vacation at least on weekend out of every month, (so its not like they're struggling) but my mom refuses to buy me a car, for reasons she can't explain, Im just really upset that she would rather have me on dangerous public transportation at those hours! I've gotten robbed once already while on the train. I saved up some money  few weeks ago and bought a car that broke 2 days after I bought it, I don't have any money left saved up and Im terrified everyday when im on the train...What can I do to make her realize that this is very dangerous!

Well I've tried to be and I still am trying........at first I tried to be super friendly.......then I tried to be like a mysterious type...then the talkative and funny........then a good boy.....then a bad boy..........and no I am not trying like "obviously trying hard" but in a subtler and humorous manner. Then I realized why don't I just be myself....so I did let things just do it's own thing while I'm being myself....but still I really don't feel likable.      I have close friends but that's it! Not that I hate that but I really want to get to know people better, and don't get me wrong I am not a loner and stuff, I am by far one of the most well known guys in school      but they hate me..very few people say hi to me, they look at me funny, I sometimes here them talking about me like they talk crraaapppppppp about me........then I thought if not for these very close friends of mine I would be always alone in group works(thank God they're always there).........

So I wanted to see others opinions about this experience, I was dating someone for six months..met in june and he popped the question at the end of December...it was a tough decision and was even murkier because in october I found out that his visa had expired for a couple years, seems like good person but i dunno...so in the end I decided not to take the proposal for marriage. I just didnt want to be used, marriage is a big step...i suggested a longer engagement period, he was not down for the idea..so wat do you guys think?   Do you think I made a wise decision?
20090205124936AAazP9m	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my friend a idiot?Does her boyfriend care about her?What should she do?	My friend cindy started dating shawn a few months ago all he wants to do is party and drink.She is crazy about him does everything and anything he wants.Problem is his ex sex buddy sheena that he works with.He still talks about her alot,calls her by a nickname he gave her,he was very much in love with her from what I gathered.She broke it off  he was heart broken.Well A week ago after work he calls cindy and tells her sheena won't leave him alone,she keeps texting him and sending naked pictures.Well he expected cindy to take his word and use her phone to call sheena i told her it was a bad idea and to tell him to go to the police if this was true.She said he wouldn't so she calls sheena insults and threatens her and they get into this huge argument.Cindy calls shawn her man shawn calls cindy the girl their just dating and she's not his girlfriend.Sheena says shawn has been trying to get back together that's why she asked not to work with him anymore.She said it wasn't untill he heard she had a boyfriend and he thought they were going to get back together that he started all the drama.After sheena and cindy's argument shawn texts sheena she showed it to me.The next day he comes out of his way to come to work on his day off to talk to sheena,then he drove past sheena's apartment.That sunday he calls the store then comes in at midnight wanting to speak to sheena alone they ended up arguing cause he got mad cause sheena reported the incident to the manager and she told him they were over i heard it.The next day he calls again wanting to talk to sheena then he convinced cindy to come there with him.I guess to make sheena jealous she wasn't there he stopped his attempts after he found out sheena was leaving.On christmas he wasn't to much with cindy he came in the store trying to speak to sheena who wouldn't even look his way.Cindy will not listen she thinks it's all sheena trying to steal shawn and he doesn't want sheena and she's a stalker.I believe shawn's the stalker and wants sheena but with cindy for sex and she's the only one dumb enough to put up with him.He let this other girl he was sleeping with insult cindy and threaten her and not say two words.

20090205122743AANmzgs	Family & Relationships;Family	How long should it take for me to get past the death of my mother?	My mother passed away January 7th suddenly at the young age of 50. She had spent 22 months in the hospital prior to this but was home for almost a year and was suppose to be getting better.       She went into the hospital because she had suddenly and drastically lost weight and was having stomach pains. It turned out she had had a twist in her bowel which was making her malnourished and not allowing her to absorb her medication for her thyroid condition.       The doctors ended up overdosing her with her thyroid medication and she went into a non responsive state and then a coma. She eventually got stronger and the doctors said she should have been getting better. Also the twist in her bowel according to the doctors had corrected itself.       She was very weak and the doctors had been planning on sending her to a rehabilitation center in the spring. She went into the hospital again because she had been bound up and in a fair amount of pain. The doctors gave her an enema and it didn't work. They kept her and planned on giving her another enema in the morning. She passed away due to heart failure later that evening.      My life has been turned completely upside down. She was not only my Mom but my best friend as well. She wanted so badly to travel the world. She wanted to become a grandmother. She wanted to get a job. This just seems so unfair. She was finally getting better and then all of a sudden she had to die. It hurts more now than it did to begin with. I cry every night.I am having a hard time eating. I can't even think of the good memories without getting upset. This whole thing makes me so mad. I mean I know someday she would have died but no one should die when they are 50.       What can I do to make this easier? I find it so hard to be at work and around my friends because everyone is acting like its just part of life. I don't know what to do.

20090205135334AA6YyiM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes mee!?!?!? Ahhh!?	Okay so this guy knows I like him, and he's known this for about a month. Ever since that hes been sitting on me, touching me, ect. (Nothing big, just more than usual)  Okay so today on the bus, there were about 5 open seats around us and he sat witrh me. He was laying on me(his head was on my chest). Then I was like literly staring into space and my good friend named Mike(not real name) was like you look pissed. I said I'm not though. But the guy put his arm around me and hugged me and pulled me close and was like, "Awwh its okay." And I always think I'm fat and he was saying I wasn't fat and I was pretty. Does it sound like he likes me? Or is he just a flirt? Because he is a hugeeee flirt.
20090205135434AA8rXhN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me back?	I've been talking to this guy and one time on Aim, I was trying to guess who he liked and he said he would tell me if I guessed it right. So I take out the yearbook and guess every single name and he said no to all of them. I told him that I guessed every one and he said that I didn't. I was thinking that I didn't say my name but I probably thought it wasn't me. Then every time I see him in school he always smiles at me. And I was talking to my friend and she told him that I liked him on aim and he said asked me if I did. I said no because I wasn't sure he liked me back. Then he said ohh like he wanted me to like him. He also flirts a lot but I think he does that to other girls too. And we sometimes sit at the sam table because my friends are friends with his friends. And at lunch I don't really eat my lunch he pretends like hes gonna take it and everything and flirts.

20090205131727AAXB7Zl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I dont know what i want but i dont want this.... Please help?	I know this is not meant for this section but at least you are all mature.      I am in love with someone that does not deserve it. I was with him for nearly 3 years but we have known eachother since we were both 8 (we are 21 now). We broke up because i was sick of his parents being involved and treating me like **** and then i found out i was pregnant. He slept with someone (his cousins girlfriend) the very next day i told him that i was pregnant and then he tried to start a relationship with another girl while we were trying to sort out our problems. Of course i did not know about the 2 girls until after the fact. The list of stuff he did is endless and what he did was cruel and heartless. (he brought one of the girls to the hospital when i lost the baby and i didnt know about it until a month or so later)      I have been abused through emails and texts from him and his new mates. I have been told that i would have been a bad mother and i should do the world a favor and kill myself (from his mouth). I have been called every name under the sun.      He come crawling back to me again when i got sick of his games and told everyone the truth about the whole situation and that he has been lying to everyone. He knows that i love him and he uses that against me all the time. He knows that i am kind and caring and he uses that. Saying he is going to kill himself and stuff like that because he has no one. As i have heaps of money and he has nothing, he comes here when he needs something. He knows that since i lost the baby that i have started to want a family and he plays on that.      I have finally taken enough of his bullshit and his lies and making out that i am the worse person out that i finally told EVERYONE the truth about him. I emailed all his so called mates and told them everything and that i have photos and text messages to prove that he is lying and that i have done nothin but been there for him!!! Everything he has said i have proved he lied about. I just got sick of the bullshit. I am tryin to move on and he keeps dragging me down!      He has texted me going off that i took everything from him!!! I did not do it out of revenge or to make his life a living hell but because I was sick of all of it. After a few weeks we started talking again (I know stupid of me) and it seemed like he had changed but deep down i know it was only doing that because the girl he wants, wants nothing to do with him. He is so sweet and caring through texts but when we are together in person I do not feel it. I thought i wanted him back and when we decided to give it one more go I just didnt feel it. Through texts i feel the butterflies when we talk but in person there is NOTHING. I dont understand. I think i only wanted what i couldnt have and now i have him i dont want him. Childish i know and that is why i am confused.      To make matters worse, he lived with his parents and has no job and when they found out he was talking to me they kicked him out and cut him off from all his money and stuff. So he is at my place (by my place i mean the room i stay at camp when i am at work) and I dont know what to do. I feel guilty for him having no where else to go but when i am around him i dont feel sexual attracted to him anymore. But when i tell him to leave i start to miss him and want him. WHY?      Sorry it is so long

She does a lot of stuff like this, for example theres this one guy who we both used to like and he liked her and I frankly didn't care but they have been on and off and he FINALLY got over after a lot of break ups and his heart being broken and her hating him and now he flirts with me and i saw her text one time to another friend saying stuff like i was cheating on my boyfriend and flirting with him. I think she just can't take not being liked by him. Idk what to do. I still want to be friends with her because shes a fun girl.

20070409130207AAP0M4S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriends EX is on my mind....help me please!?	Me and my boyfriend have been together for 6 months. I am truly in love with him and i'm sure he loves me too. Things seem to be going well. The problem is I can't stop thinking about his ex girlfriend. I saw a pic of her on Myspace and now it's constantly on my mind. I am always getting on Myspace now to check her myspace acount and see what's on there. I'm scared he thinks of her and misses her. (he doesn't know I feel this way) I know it sounds weird and crazy. BUT my past relationship of 7 years has made me this way, it was really bad and messed me up. I'm sooooo scared of getting hurt. It took me 3 years of being alone before I felt comforatable enough to be in another relationship.The crazier thing is she isn't that pretty. I do beleive he loves me, and he has given me no reason to worry. I have talked about this to my mom and friends and they have told me to stop but I don't know how. What is wrong with me?? Why can't I stop worring about this?

He's been one of my best friends for 2 years now.(we're both 15)  He's told me that he likes me a lot and always hugs me. He never actually asked me out or anything so we're technically still friends. I want to be more than friends with him, but I don't want to rush him. I think I've given him a lot of time though. Should I go ahead and talk to him, or still wait and hope that he'll do something? Also would it be too risky to give him a kiss?

20090205105222AAyOWTC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I cheat with my brothers wife ?	My brother of all my life just got married.  His wife is a stone cold fox.

20090205115402AAvxKpi	Family & Relationships;Family	YOU BORED? 3 adult family members in my home not contributing financially, can't seem to find my backbone.?	So here is the situation:      I am 23 years of age, I work as a researcher for a local publications company. I am sharing a 2 bedroom with my mom, 19 year old brother, and 37 year old brother, and ALL are unemployed and not helping me whatsoever. They sleep all day (Sleep when I get home from work in the middle of the afternoon) And Im trying to push them into starting a business together, like Janitorial or something home based      Im getting pretty stressed about it because I feel they are wasting away when there is so much that can be done. I am worried and am trying to find a way to approach them. I am usually a pretty outspoken person but when it comes to stuff like this I am quite passive aggressive due to the fact that my family has spent several years living in hotels and I believe their spirits are shot.      Any suggestions? (and for those who just want something sarcastic to say, don't.)         Thanks!
20090205115439AA7UP62	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I know what's best for me?	I am stuck trying to make a tough decision, and I don't know what to do. I have been going back and forth about my decision to join the airforce,  i know that it will be good for me, help me grow up, get a sense of self, confidence, responsibility, I'm 24, and I am just getting older everyday, I have to do something for my life now. I have very few support systems,my mom, aunt, other aunt(got her own life) and uncle (not dependable) My aunt worries that I won't be able to take care of myself if something happens to her. I want to ease her mind and mine that I'll be ok. However, my mom has a brain injury, and needs help on a daily basis, her cognitive skills are slow. I help take care of her. I am scared of leaving home, and leaving her here by herself pretty much. My aunt has full time job, very busy, and not home during the day to watch my mom. Not knowing if my mom will be ok is the reason why I am questioning my decision to join. Apart of me just wants to stay home and take care of her the rest of my life, but other part knows I have to live my life too. I don't know how to put out my mind my concerns about my mom, and just make this decision confidently. How do I convince myself to not worry? It's tearing me up, I don't want to put her in a home
20090205120453AAHiB3l	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So yeah, i flipped out today...?	and while me and my husband are already on the brink of divorce...the problem is, i cant control my manic outburst. I really honestly cant control them!  i threw a pack of smokes at him today and pushed him...and of course he got super mad. I apologized and he went back to work. so i made a dr apt with a psychologist for an evaluation. I have always been in denial, but bi polar disorder is really in my family...i just hoped i didnt have it.       After all that today, i have cleaned the house, went and bought him a present, and im gonna have dinner made....but, im guessing i just need to comply with whatever he says. i truly think if i get better, he will want me back...at least i hope. any other suggestions for me> how should i talk to him about the fact that i cant help it and i am seeking medical help...i need him now more than ever and i want to tell him that without sounding desperate

20090205134507AA2gia1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I teach my husband without being too direct?	He's very sweet and tender with me.  He adores me and takes good care of me.  The thing is he won't make a move unless I literally tell him to.  He doesn't try anything different either.  I don't know what he's scared of.  I'll never say no unless aunt flo is visiting and then we'll do something else.  It would be nice if he would just grab me and have his way.  Which would be my way too.  I can't just tell him.  That would be too much, I want him to want to.

20090205121254AAOb2zd	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a form of infidelity?	My husband and I have been married going on 2 years. Our decision to get married was abrupt but we felt it was what we wanted. A year into our marriage we started experiencing problems with communication, intimacy, affection and different lifestyles. I have tried to seek marriage counseling but my husband has refused to meet me half way on the planning process. I have also tried to plan weekend getaways but that has fallen through the cracks. We have had numerous talks and he would be receptive for about 2-3 weeks then we are back around to the same problem. FRUSTRATING!!!! My ex, who was my first love, somehow found me and got in contact with me. We, to this day, still have the best conversations! We don't talk about the past or why we broke up but in the conversations I get a lot of what I am missing from my husband, affection, attentiveness and on top of all that our conversations are productive. I noticed that the things he wants out of life fit exactly what I thought my husband and I would have but it's not there anymore. I guess my question would be, if I continue to have these conversations with my ex is this a form of infidelity?

On of my best friends has been dating his current girlfriend for almost a year now. He confided in me that when they started dating he was having some trouble financially.  He moved in with her halfway through the summer and has been living at her house since.  She does not know though that over the summer the bank began the process of foreclosing on his house.  In late fall his house went up for sale.  I always asumed he told her about his house since he had talked to me about it multiple times.  Then she made the comment to me a month back that I should rent his house since hes not using on it and just paying for it to sit empty. I've tried to tell him to tell her, but he thinks she'll leave him.  Should I tell her... or leave that up to him to decide?

20090205121918AAmBJlE	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Are you okay with your husband having porn? Does it offend you or hurt your self-esteem?	I know that a lot of people say that porn isn't a big deal and that if a woman cares it just shows that she's insecure. Well, maybe I am because it really hurts me when I have a partner who is choosing masturbating to porn more often than showing a real interest in me. It leaves me feeling lacking and therefore undesired, boring and insecure.       Are most women okay with their partners having porn or is it something that most women just tolerate? I feel like I'm being replaced by it and can't compete.

20090205122420AAJ29mg	Family & Relationships;Friends	Ok, will someone make me feel better about this?	I've had a rough time with my baby's father the past few months.  He declared it was over, but would not leave my house.  Some of you might remember the story.  So we went two-three days without a single word being said.  Then he broke down, began crying, saying his "sorries" etc.  Only this time I insisted on standing my ground.  I was tired of games, his laziness, lack of support -just everything.  I told him I would CONSIDER getting back together with him IF he gets his life in order and starts helping me, taking more responsibility with the family, stops all his "pipe dreams" everyday...etc.  I said I would let him live the last two months of the lease with me and by the end if he has not found a place, I will have found one for just me and my daughter and he will need to continue working on getting his stuff in order.        I've always been attracted to this other guy at my work.  He is going through a divorce, and we're both down in the dumps from time to time.  So I make him come out with me on my lunch break and drink a couple and play pool etc.  We've always talked and never been flirty...but today we were flirty.  Big time and I liked it.  Part of me feels guilty and it's not like neither party knows the truth.  I've been truthful to both, stated where I stand.  My baby's dad doesn't KNOW about him, so maybe that's why I feel guilty?      Should I feel guilty?  Even if nothing has happened -not even a kiss yet (YET)?  Should I keep going because I like it?  WHAT do I do?
20090205122755AAbywMo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think my husband has some kind of mental illness?	He is angry all the time, defensive, cant see anyone's feelings but his own, depressed, get upset easily, controling, manipulative...then plays like he doesnt know what I am talking about. He would never go on drugs, is totally against them! He yells at me then gets mad a me for being upset with him! Then he asks me why Iam upset? I told him because he is always yelling and swearing at me, and he says, "When did i yell at you". Just stuff like that, his games confuse me and I have had about enough. I want to leave and have a normal life! I try to tell him what he does to hurt me and then he just says, I do the same to him, which makes NO sense! I am kind to him, always asking how his day was, and showing that I care. I get nothing like that from him. I had my first counseling appointment yesturday alone because of grieving for my little brother who was killed only 6 months ago. Does he ask me how it went?? No!! He cant see anyone but himself and is the most selfish person I have EVER met?? There has got to be something wrong with him?? He wont support me at all and is controlling like I said. I have just about had it!! He needs to admit he has a problem, or I am leaving. How do I convince him that he is wrong?? We have been married for 2 yrs and have a 13month old daughter...

20090205123038AAUCcZV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do you consider they should divorce at this age?	I'm speaking about a couple of 51 (her) and  68 (him) who is getting through a marriage crisis. They wanna divorce, but at the same time they consider it's being too late for that. What can you say about itn?       When they got married 25 years ago, he'd just got over a bad divorce (he's wife moved to US and took his children with her). He has always been a famous physician and couldn't give up his career for the sake of his ex wife (whom he loved, but couldn't get along with).      Afterwards, he met her, beautiful, young, and willing to fall for a men who was famous and rich, but 17 years elder than her. She has always assumed to have loved him, but the truth is they've never been a happy couple (and what's ironic that everybody envied them for looking so well together, strange is it? )       He has always been jealous on her and suspected her of cheating on him every time she became more friendly with a man. When I asked him why he never asked her a thing about it, he replied he was afraid of not losing her. The point is that in spite of his fear of not messing up his second marriage, he was leading it to disaster.       They have 2 children together and are old enough to drift apart, but is it to late to end up of relationship if there is no love to make you stay? What do you consider of it?

20090205123703AA0SvLm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How much does divorce cost...?	Hi all -   I am posting this question because I don't know what to do or where to go.  I live in MO and we have 3 kids.   I just want a generalization so I can know what to expect.  I contacted a few lawyers for prices and they all wanted at least a $1500 retainer.  I don't have that type of money.  I called Legal Services and they said they represented my husband before so there is a conflict, they can't help me.  I really just want to be out of this and divorce is so freeing it will release the attachment and end this dead relationship, finally and for good.    I just don't understand how it could cost so much and so many people are getting them.   I thought it would be about $500 at the most for broke people like me, but I could be wrong.   Any advice, suggestions, help, would be appreciated.   Thank you

I have hung out with this guy twice, but we talk on the phone and computer all the time. I am into him, which I know is pathetic considering I've only met him twice, but we have so much in common and get along so well. He makes me smile. He's the kind of guy who could walk into a room and pick out whatever girl he wanted to date, but he doesn't. He flirts with me sometimes. I found this funny card that reminded me of him to send him and wrote him a letter telling him that I'm into him and why and that I appreciate him being there for me a lot. I also mentioned that I know it's a bit corny and creepy. Do you think he'll like it or do you think it will weird him out?

He never talks about inappropriate things, fyi.  He also talks about other things, not just dating.  Thx.

I've liked this guy in my grade for over 5 months, we talk and everything but i really want to get his attention. I think he may like me too but i think he's just as scared as i am.

20090205130726AAN6Sws	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to return to work after having 3 years off after having my daughter?	Im feeling really insecure about this, and honestly just dont know where to start.  I think like most people that have had a break from work i just feel a bit useless!!  I have a BA in Psychology and Criminology that i completed about 6 years ago.  I never ended up working from it though, as I travelled straight after completing it, then low and behold, met my husband, and we started a family.  To be perfectly honest i feel i've lost my drive for working in this area in any case and i feel I have left it too long to work in the area I have studied.  Looking after my daughter (and husband!) for so long has been really lovely, but i feel if i dont get back into the workforce soon, it may be too late.  Does anyone have any tips from having done it themselves?
20090205130729AAozGht	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being blown off?	I met this wonderful girl the other week.  The first night out we talked more than we ate.  It lasted about 3 hours.  I think she is the most wonderful person I have come across.      We were supposed to go to the museum this week, but she text me that she has the flu.  I hope she gets better.      There are so many places to where I want to go out with her.        She said she'll call me in a couple of days.      But in the back of my mind I am wondering whether I am being blown off.  Maybe because it usually happens to me.  People try to be nice by saying it in different terms.      But with Valentine's Day approaching, I wanted to go someplace with her.      I know that I am feeding my imagination thinking that she does not like me even though we had this wonderful conversation on our first date.      What are your thoughts on it?      I really want this to work.  It's going to be funny when I look back on this when we continue going on dates.
20090205135611AA2vYJG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wouldn't you think he feels this way?	You been with the same man for 14 years and known him for 20. He calls you his wife. Everything you and him share together it is like you are married (but) he is still legally married to his ex. They have two kids ages 24 and 22 together. He doesn't see them often because they live far away.  They do not want to have anything to do with his fiance.  His ex had sent him divorce papers back in 1994 and he put them aside. I got together with him the end of 94 and he gave me the papers to file away.  I was young and didn't know the final paper is a divorce decree. He never followed through nor did she. She never met anyone special and I guess she didn't care or my friend's husband must have told her something to hold on, maybe?    Now today she tells him let's go to a lawyer and file to get this done so we can get married. He goes he feels it isn't important it is only a piece a paper. He doesn't care if they go to Vegas and marries and he is still married to the other. He really doesn't care.  Then he changed his tune Monday night saying to my closest friend your right, your right.  She is so sick and stressed about it it is making her very sick.    She is thinking he doesn't really want to be legally married to her and keeps on hesitating. Doesn't it seem this way?    What would you do?

20090205133034AAfXzcN	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Best Friend Pretended To Be Someone Else To Hurt People. Please Help Me.?	Well. It's hard to explain really because it is so complicated. So I'll make it as simple as possible without missing out on the important information. My best friend created a fake msn account so that she could get at two boys who had 'ruined her life' She used photos off the internet and pretended to be this person. She told me about it and i instantly though of how wrong she was to do that. But i didn't say anything to her. Then one night i was round her house and she signed onto this fake persons account, she said that she'd say she had a friend round and gave me a fake name. At the time i just went along with it. Then a few days later i realized in one of the boy's names it mentioned about how excited he was because he was going to meet up with this girl. He really believed this person was true and was really really into her. I really didn't want him, or the other guy to get hurt. So one night i came out with it on msn. Thankfully they believed me. Then when my best friend found out i'd told them she had a go at me and said she wanted to forget about me because i had completely ruined her life forever. This upset me as i was certain i had done the right thing. Then one of my other best mates started having a go at me too and made me feel really bad about myself. So now i'm kinda in a depressed state of mind. I really want to sort things out with my best mates who now hate me. I'm not desperate but i really do want to be mates with them still, i cant talk to them though because they have blocked and deleted me. So now what i've done is just eating away at me and is making me constantly depressed and upset. I'm certain i did the right thing, but i just wish i hadn't because things would still be fine with my best mates if i had said nothing. Please help me, i don't no what to do. Any help would be appreciated a lot. Thank-you for reading all this, and thank-you if you reply to me.

20090205132840AAWHhAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend isn't working and has no money...is he trying to control sex?	My boyfriend and I live together and have been together for a year.  He hasn't been working for 6 months so I pay the rent and the bills.  I feed him, cloth him and pay to entertain him.  I know if the situation was reversed I would feel out of control.  So he controls when we have sex.  I like sex a lot...especially with him.  I'm good at it and I enjoy it.  Some weeks we'll have sex 5 nights in a row.  Other weeks we don't have it at all.  I'll touch him, he'll get hard, and then he'll roll over.        Last night, he was hard, was touching me and practically f**ing me and then he pulled up his boxers and rolled over.  So I got pissed!  I was like "what the hell".  If we haven't had sex in 10 days and you are going to mess with me like that...of course I am going to be pissed!      Am I overreacting?      Secondly, he flirts with woman on myspace.  I have asked him to stop.  He has me blocked from his page and won't add me as a friend.  Says he should be able to have something that is his own and private and friends of his own besides me.  He claims they are all friends, many of them are married or friends from high school, and I should be ok with it considering we live together and he is home with me every night and sleeping in my bed.        So my coworker created a profile and asked him to be her friend.  He doesn't know her.  He immediately accepted and they started emailing just harmless emails.  This morning he went online and put under one of her photos "you look nice".  What do you think about this?  Crazy?        I don't know what to do to make things better and don't want him to move out or break up.  We are both in our 30's and there are a lot of good things about him.  His worst quality is his flirting but he does the dishes, makes the bed, takes out the trash, massages my back, holds my hand, the sex is good...when we have it.        Any advice?

So my friend Kristy is acting strange, and sometimes when I want to talk she says no, which is understandable, but she's a ***** about it, and i feel like i'm clinging on.. and she is the only friend i feel like i am clinging on to. So i have decided I don't want to be her friend if she is going to act that way. I really don't like people like that, and we get into fights daily. I think her boyfriend, Rob is the problem because she ditches me for him. So I want to forget her once and for all. If you could help, and give me steps, that would be GREAT. If not, I understand =] Thanks for taking the time to read this. And don't try to change my mind, cause i am 200% sure i want to let her go. Thanks!

20090205135004AA30lh9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Married man, guys night out, stupid buddies, drinks, strip club, dog house.  Guilty until proven innocent?	Ok, I'll try to make this short.  I'm married, 9 years, and have two awesome kids, and a beautiful, really cool wife.  Two years ago my friends (also married) asked me to go to a dinner outing they were having for another friends birthday.  My birthday is around the same time so it was kind of a double dinner celebration.  We went to the local casino, and had an awesome dinner, walked around and looked at the poor saps loosing all their money in the slots and then went home.  It was a relatively uneventful night of middle aged guys stuffing their faces and cracking jokes at each other.  The next year, the idea came around again, and the wives encouraged us to go and blow off some steam.  My wife actually suggested that this time I throw a few bucks in the slots and try to bring home a little extra cash.  Anyway, we all headed off to the same casino again, ate the same food, and hung out watching a blues band.  Then on the way home, one of our more adventurous buddies says, "Let's go to this cool place I heard about."  And yes it turned out to be a strip club.  I'm 35 and was at one once when I was 18 and thought ok what the hell.  I'm sure my rum and cokes helped hold back any protest.  So we go in and there's a bar on one side and the poles and girls on the other.  Three of us hung out at the bar (looking old and lame) and laugh at the other guys getting their drunken groove on with the ladies.  We were there for not quite an hour and then drove home.  The car ride was filled guys realizing they would be totally busted if their wives found out and an oath of secrecy was formed.  Here's where I started to not like the situation.  The next morning, my head hurt and I was asked how it went.  My response: "Good food, good band, still no gambling and.... uhmm.. umm... hmmm.. that's all."  I just couldn't say it.  Not sure why, and looking back, it was friggin stupid but I didn't fess up.  Probably because I know my wife has a tendency to blow things out of proportion and maybe I just didn't want to deal with three days of interogation. I was on my best behavior and have 6 buddies to back me up, but none of that matters.  What does matter is I lied.  Now a year has gone by, and the guys want to go again, ... minus the strip club, because we realize it was kind of a goofy thing to do and we're a little too old (and married) for that kind of thing.  But one of the wives found out about the previous year's strip club event, and furiously threatened to tell all the other wives.  So in order to minimize damage, I fessed up myself and tried my best to explain to my wife how stupid I was for lying.  Now things have never been worse between us, even though I've never once had any contact with another woman or intentions of ever doing anything with anyone other than my wife... I mean, she's friggin hot!  But nonetheless, I'm kind of afraid things could snowball downhill from here and I don't know what to do.  She won't look at me, speak to me, or answer any txt or email.  I'm completely shut out.  I don't know what else to do.     Desperately seeking advice.     Thanks..    -Faithful yet Stupid.

Lately, he said that he has always wanted to date me and make me his and his only.  He said that he didn't want to disrespect me by coming at me but he knows for a fact that my boyfriend is cheating and he doesn't deserve me.  I am really attracted to him and always have been.

20090205135956AAXGh9s	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do when boyfriend has doubts?	My boyfriend and I only started dating about 2 weeks ago. He was crazy about me when we first started dating. We have so much in common and always have a lot of fun whenever we are together. Lately he has been kinda busy with school and work, so I don't get to see him all the time. Today I talked to him and basically he isn't as crazy about me as he originally was. In the beginning, he was kinda afraid that he was gonna fall for me too hard and then get hurt. I have no idea what to think. He also is debating on whether or not he wants to stay together. He said to me that he likes me a lot. I'm so confused. Will he stay with me? What should I do? How should I act? I'm at a loss for words right now.

Its been a good distraction and arguably a good motivator.  Do you think an adults-only gym playing porn on televisions would be a success?    Do you think your spouse would be more amorous or adventurous if they worked out there?    Do you think theyd be more likely to cheat?    ( asked this in the Fitness section but it's already scrolled off with 1 answer .. time for the erotica section .. )
20090205150100AAVTtKD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women tease? Do they do it to hurt a guy's feelings? Do they know it's wrong?	Why do women tease? Do they do it to hurt a guy's feelings? ?   THere was a girl in college sitting on a guy I was hanging out with's lap and she was moving up and down starting to moan. She was cute, it got all our attention but then she said "I was KIDDING".       But the thing is, I didn't think she was a bad person/tease, she seemed really nice and smart, but it's like---do ALL women tease?      Or is that just her character?      It's just a double standard because even though guys do it too, if called on it, they're buried into the ground 8 feet deep.      If a woman's called on it, the guy's psycho and is just sad because he read to omuch into the girl.      That's how society perceives it.
20090205150049AAUAqXv	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is ignoring me......and choosing other people over me?	My so called best friend is like acting differnt.       First:      She ignores me at lunch because I'm not on her team at school (that's how my middle school divades up gardes) She talks to the people in her home room and completly ignores me.      Second:      I got in a "fight" with somebody today (not one of those fights were somebody gets a black eye but a fight) She cared for five minuted than just didn't care.         I don't get whats wrong with my friend. She chooses me over these people she only met this year, and she chooses her old best friend over me.       I didn't do anything.       These people she started hanging with.....I hate them. And her old best friend is a *****. And the other one is just annoying.            What do you think is wrong with my friend?         Thanks.

What are all these unemployed people to do when they have a mortgage to pay? Unemployment doesnt pay enough to cover all the expenses. We have no credit cards, only housing and utilities.I still work but my husband is the main source of income. What are people to do about their house payments?

So I would like to hear your experiences to help me through this hard time.I'm fearful it could take a very long time for things to recover and that we will lose our home.

20090205150113AACdXze	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'd like to hang out with this friend less. Am I on the right track?	I've been gradually trying to be around her less and less. I've been saying no to out-of-school plans, like going shopping or going to her house. I've also been staying after school, as she does to hang out with me, and just slipping away to the library to do homework. After all, I am allowed to do whatever I want after school, right? I don't have to inform her of my every move. If she finds me, then she basically follows me and says that she has nothing better to do. My problem with her is that she's jealous and competitive, brags, and copies everything about me. Everyone notices, and I'm really getting tired of it. I think she's starting to get the hint because she's been acting a little annoyed with me, in a really immature way, which makes it pretty obvious. Am I on the right track? Is what I'm doing okay, without actually telling her to get lost?

Him and I still talk, but when i called him out on that statement he said that his friends were lying. These guys are solely his friends and never actually even liked me that much so why would they make it up?

This girl i have been "hanging out" with for the last few days has shown some pretty big signs of liking me.      For example she fools around with me all the time, like we toss playful insults back and forth to each other. She will sit real close to me, turn red when she looks at me, and smile big. She tells me how good looking i am, says i have great teeth, hair, the only good looking boy she knows with brown eyes. She says how she was scared to approach me and even avoided me before we met. She wants to go on a road trip just the two of us.      Anyway, she hasnt blurted out "i like you" yet to me and i am wondering if i should just say it first. I'm kinda nervous.

WAS IT A GOOD CHOICE?	i used to chill with a group of ppl, i've known most of them since third grade. and i had recently found out that my friend(she just turned 14) has been having sex with her boyfrind that she's been dating for a year. in my opinoin it doesn't mater how long you've been dating the guy, it matters how old you are and if you're in love. well they fight al the time, and rarely speak with eachother in public. their relationship is all physical at a very young age.      anyway i told her my opinoin and she didn't like it. i have seperated myself fromn her and the group she hangs out with.   did i make the right choice??

This year it deffinitly isnt as bad. I have liked other guys and he has been single since last year. but now i found out he may like this other girl who is a grade younger than myself, yet i kno i can live with him liking another girl and feel happy for him.       i have had since then many many other guys who have liked me, goodlooking, jock guys may i add. But even if i do like them, deep down inside i always jus feel a little heart broken still. There have been guys that i found myself thinking about but when i see him or talk to him, its like all those ppl dissappear and all thats left is him. He runs thro my head all the time still, and no matter who i meet or who i fall for its just never the same. its been 1.5 years now and if he told me he liked me the way i like him, theres no doubt that i would take him back. how do i stop liking this boy??? i see him in school too, we have a period together.

20090205145635AAtZKGv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I feel really weird going over there but still want to!! What do they think of me now?	I met this group of guys the other day (they are my friend's roomates) and we partied at their house together. I kissed one of them two nights in a row but he wanted to do more, he started touching me all over but I took his hands off and left. I really like him but he seems to be a party boy, so I guess it will go nowhere. I found out his other friend thought I was hot, but this guy actually wants a girlfriend. So the next time I went over there, I started flirting with his friend. While we were talking the other guy kept looking at me periodically, but I kinda ignored him. It would be nice to get a relationship with that guy, but I dont want to rush it so I just want to be friends with all of them for now. But everytime I go over there, I feel so awkward that they think I am slut or something and they dont like me. What do they think of me? Should I not go over there anymore?
20090205150559AAnBCu2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Because "I met him online" isn't romantic!?	I should just be happy that I found a great guy; it shouldn’t matter how we met.  I met him online.  I always thought online dating seemed rather desperate, but I tried it anyway out of curiousity and it actually worked.  But it doesn’t seem like a romantic story to tell how we met.       I don’t want to sound like I’m crazy, but I’ve had depression and anxiety issues since I was a kid and am in counseling.  It’s difficult for me to meet boyfriends or even new friends for that matter.  I’m on a college sports team so I basically practice and concentrate on my school work.  I don’t go out and socialize much.  Because I’m an athlete I don’t drink or go out to parties.        I especially avoid telling my parents the truth how we met.  I usually just say we met at the park.  Technically, it’s not a lie.  It was just pre-arranged date.  It was actually the first time we met; I just leave out the part that it was set up online.  My parents are old fashioned and think online dating is ridiculous, and probably worried about all the shady people on them.        Would you tell people that you met your significant other on an online dating site?  What kind of reactions did you get?   I’m sure the people that care about me would be glad that my therapy is working and that I’ve actually felt good enough to go out and find someone.  It sure beats having my family worrying that I might go out and hurt myself because of my problems.  But still, I avoid the online dating subject. Any thoughts?

20090205143110AAdPMmR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why should I even bother with school anymore..?	No lectures please, just bear with me for a second.         Okay, so I started off decent but it's getting kind of hard. I'm in 6th grade. First year of middle school. Now I don't even think I should bother with it anymore. My parents don't care and I honestly think the only reason my mom gets me up in the morning is so she doesn't go to jail. (my sisters got in trouble with truancy and if I do anymore she could go to jail). Why should I even bother? My parents pay no attention to my schooling, and all my friends don't give a ****. (Excuse my french). Anyways, what's the point? Like, right now I couldn't care less if I make it to college or not.

Im a shy person(which im trying to work on) especially around girls. But I do hang out with friends. All my friends and even my 14 year old brother has someone.      I feel like a complete loser. I probably am anyway. I really want a girl to cuddle, have my first kiss, spend time with etc.      I hear things like my time will come. But it's soooooooooooooooo easy to say that if you aren't in my position right?      I am sick of seeing everyone around me in relationships. I always wonder when it actually is going to be "my turn".

Everyday, he looks at me, then when I look at him, he looks down. And one of his classes is right by my locker, so when he comes by, he often shuts my locker when i just open it. Then sometimes, he comes up to me, and goes "Sorry, but im taken." and he smiles widely and laughs. But most of the time, he either teases me about something, or is very rude to me. Sometimes he goes "ew." then he smiles. So im so confused, and don't know what to think. Once when we were talking, he told me he had a friend, so ive been feeling so mixed up. Does he like me or not?   21 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.

20090205145047AAkcMpw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He cheated on me and I feel like dieing?!?	So recently I've been dating this guy. I felt an immediate connection with him. Things were going well with us for about 3 months.  I learned early on that he was really on again off again with me, one minute he would say he wanted to be with me for sure, the next he said lets just take things slow. And any time I backed off hed come back and chase me.  I thought things were really good and everything , until he started freaking out and saying that we were " just friends".  But then when we spent time together it wouldnt be like that and he'd say he takes it back.  That he had a lot of feelings for me and wanted to see where things went for the longterm.  The last 2 weeks, I was really upset with how he'd been acting and I said I needed sometime to think about things, and maybe we should have some time apart. This did NOT go over well, I tried calling him in this period, just to keep the communication but he would have none of it.  Turns out I find out this week, he sends me in a text that I need to move on with things and That hes seeing someone he "really likes" and he hopes I do the same thing.  What makes him think he can do this and why would he?? I found out through a friend he truly is seeing someone and has been for the past month, while I thought we were together.  So things I guess are going good with this new girl.  I'm just so upset I hope he likes her way more..and I just hope he doesnt do this to her. What the hell did I do that I'm not good enough and he chose her over me? The pain is too much to deal with I just want to die, I was VERY connected to him. I guess he doesnt' even miss me.  The rejection is just killing me, and I dont really want to live right now, thinking about him kissing some other girl. His sister says this is some kind of pattern he has done in the past.

20090205140209AAh6rUw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I think I screwed up.  Need Guys opinion.?	I have been friends with a guy I met here in the US. He lives in the UK. We kept in touch via email/text over the past 5 months about every 2 weeks.       We just started having phone conversations - 2 calls. First lasted 1 hour. The next was 2 hours. I am in the midst of separating from my partner but haven't told the brit yet. The call got flirty and I asked if I wasn't involved would he be interested in me - he said yes I am attractive. Said he promised to come to the states and see me. In fact on during that very phone call he was in the US and tried to get a connection to my state but couldn't. He also said he was shy and doesn't like to approach women, reveal feelings, He's 38 and single, etc.       So after call --here's where I screwed up   I texted him the next day to say have a nice trip, then I emailed him a funny email 3 days later..      This is where I nailed the coffin shut - Then yesterday I called him to ask him something we discussed previously. His phone was off and went straight to voicemail.       It has been nearly 2 weeks since last call which isn't that long but he didn't respond to the email (which was funny) or the text. What do you think? I am so mad at myself for feeling insecure. Would a guy go from hot to cold that fast ?No he isn't married.

20090205140336AA3F5Xi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could it be love, or am I just fooling myself?	I've been through quite a few stupid relationships up until now, and for a few years now, I've had this feeling, that maybe I don't know how to love anymore. Or how to, at least feel love.    There's a guy who I have known for about two years now, and he had "waited" for me for about a year. We've been going out for a few months now. Whenever I think about him, I smile. Being with and/or around him makes me happy. In conclusion, he makes me happy.    Today, he asked me if I'd like to be his girlfriend; I said yes, because I do know that I - at least - like him. I also know that he loves me. But the thing is, that I don't know if I really do love him; my heart does not start beating any faster when I'm with him, there's no butterflies, no surge-y feelings in my tummy/chest, none of that.    All I know for sure, is that he knows how to make me happy, that he has strong feelings for me (but he's a bit shy with them), and that I do like him and care for him a lot. But I sometimes think that it might not be enough.    What do you guys think?

20090205142651AAqmefK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my girlfriend playing the field and what does red"together" mean...please help!?	I have been in an on and off relationship with my girlfriend for some time.  Past aside here is what is going on.      I was over her house one night ago and someone called but she didn't answer.  I asked who he was and she kept changing the subject.  A day or two later I asked again and why she avoided it and she said it was someone from her old job that keeps wanting to take her out but she doesn't want to go.        Well, yesterday she was acting strange and I felt something was up.  I ended up spending the night because I was too tired (different beds).  I woke up at one point to check the internet and couldn't help but looked at her email.  I didn't find any emails from him, but then I checked the sent emails.        I found one email that had been going back and forth for about 2 months.  They seem to be harmless up until the one that was dated about a month ago (before we got gf/bf terms) where they were it said something from her like "looking forward to us getting together(together was in red the rest of the email was in blue) for (dinner/movies...I cannot remember)."  I forgot what came after it because the "red colored "together"" got to me.  She says they have never been intimate.  She also told me that he might come by to help with a project because I said I might have some problems with it.....I said i could do it, but might take me a moment.  It didn't and still doesn't sit with me well.      So, 2 questions:      1)  Do you think something is going on or just friends?      2)  (moreso from the girls)  What does a red colored "together" mean when rest of an email is in blue?

Today I almost got into a fight with him until he backed off but I might actually get into a fight tomorrow with him. What would the consequences be of kicking his ***?

20090205144636AAIWCb0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have a morale Dilemma involving a girl?	This girl I talk to on msn is 16, at college studying Alvs. I'm 20 studying public services lv3 at college. My dilemma is that I like her a lot and she likes me a lot but I wonder if it would be best to end it now before it goes too far. I have had other GF same age as me before and they never worked out well due to lack of anything in common or the wanting to see other people. This girl is 4yrs younger and we have so much in common and I DON’T want her for sex before anyone asks.         So what doe you guys think? What would be the right thing to do?

20090205144656AAS691X	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I broke up with my girlfriend because she cheated on me.... but I love her to pieces and I want her back?	My girlfriend I had been together for officially 3 months... but had known each other for 4 months beforehand where we had been seeing each other on and off while she had break ups with her ex boyfriend. We got together at xmas when she and her boyfriend broke up for good.      Honest to god, she is the most amazing person I have ever met. She lights up my world. We are always laughing...we have so many memories already... she is my universe. Things have been going amazingly too. We went on holiday had such an amazing time... But 2 days ago she went up to bristol too see her friends as usual for a weekend. I rang her on the monday when she was on her way home... she seemed grumpy and off with me. Later when she got back she rang me and told me she couldn't do the relationship anymore. She said that she was thinking about it in bristol and sees me as a best friend rather than a boyfriend because I've known her so long and she doesn't want to hurt me by carrying it on any further. I accept it and cry for a while..      She calls me again asking me to meet her next day. She starts to kiss me.. I stop her, ask her what the hell she thinks shes doing. She cries and tells me the reason she dumped me was because she drunkenly cheated on me in bristol with a random guy from a club. She told me she was absolutely wasted and regretted it so much in the morning she cried for hours. She said I was the only one for her and she loved me to absolute pieces, which I know is totally true.      At the end of the day, I told her that I was sorry but I couldn't be with her anymore. The thought of another guy with her made me sick. But even after two days I miss like you can't imagine. She is my universe... I thought we could be everything. I want her back tbh... but not yet. Should I give it a week to let things stew in her mind so that she recognises how much she needs me?      Or should I take her back at all for a matter of fact.I know she cheated but we're perfect for each other it seems like such a waste.. she completes me as a person. Thanks
20090205144838AA9qXR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She never mentions his name?	I speak to a woman on some occasions, and when she ever speaks about her partner she never calls hime by his name, it's always 'him' or 'him in doors' and 'he's like that'. Why is this?
20090205144841AAQ7bUC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How should I read this?	Ok, so there's this guy that I'm getting myself worked up over and I know I need to stop but it's hard.  I don't really know him all that well but last April on the way back from a trip to NYC we ended up holding hands and cuddling. The school year was ending and we never really communicated what exactly was going on between us over the summer.  In the fall when we were back at school he said that he didn't want a relationship at that time and that he didn't really know me very well.   I was able to accept that there would never be a relationship between us.  This semester he is doing an internship so he's not at school but he came back to visit and after I saw him at church we talked for while and hung out afterwords for a little while.  This was really my first time hanging out with him if you don't count NYC where we were with a group.  He told me he's coming back in a few weeks said that he'd message me when he's coming back and that we could see each other then.  I've gotten worked up over him again the past few days because now I'm not sure if he may in the future want a relationship with me.  I'm not sure if he actually is going to message me telling me when he's coming back, whether he was just saying it or if he's going to forget.  I'd see him in church either way but I wish I knew whether he actually meant he is going to message me and see if we can hang out or how to take this.  I know I'm overanalyzing this and getting worked up for nothing but I really like him and he's a nice guy.

20090205145011AAMK0g4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a sign of love?	Is it possible to end up loving someone in the future from dating in 9th grade? (married) Because I dated this one boy, and we're in 9th grade, and we have "gone out" about twice now. But currently we're not dating, but we both still like each other. Well i think, I know that I still like him, and I'm pretty sure that he still likes me too. But the bad thing is that we don't talk very much anymore. We broke up like 2 weeks ago, and the same thing happened to us twice. When we were, "going out" I felt like I didn't like him as much as if we are not? Is this a sign of "love"? Because like now, I miss him, and i like him very much. I don't know what do to? Because I dream about him almost every night, good dreams, and i think about him all the time, and i cant get him out of my mind. I just want to know if we're just going through a fase? If this is normal? If things like this happen to people that end up getting married in the future?

20090205145735AAI26Hh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this prove that he does not like me?	Me and my friends from work went out for a meal as the company paid for a really posh dinner in London... and basically, I really like one of my co-workers...he is gorgeous and has a great personality...      I thought he liked me because we have great conversations and he always makes an effort to talk to me and sometimes makes compliments towards me....      But I am now convinced that he does not like me because when we all went out for dinner, he was sat talking to me and one of the other guys said 'theres a really good looking girl over there at the bar' and the guy I like walked over to have a look at this girl !!!!!!!!!! He then returned to his seat and continued to talk to me.      I couldnt believe it, I felt so bad. Should I just forget him????   If he was into me, I'm sure he wouldnt do that; do you agree?
20090205150059AAhv7Wz	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to make a annoying girl leave you alone without making them mad? READ ALL THE DETAILS PLEASE?	There is this one girl at our school who thinks that we are her friends but we're not. She keeps asking us for food and money and nobody wants to be her friend. We are always nice to her but we cant take it anymore. I am just about ready to punch her. The reason I dont want to be mean is because she knows some of our secrets and we're afraid that she will reveal them if she gets mad.
20090205150123AAXPzFr	Family & Relationships;Family	Lonely.................?	So I've been feeling extremely lonely lately. Like nobody really gets me at all. I have one friend who does, but our communication kind of stopped flowing recently. I'm a high school student in ninth grade. I go to a private school where there arent a lot of guys to go around and im one of the few who doesnt and never has had a boy friend and I don't understand this. I get told that I'm gorgeous and sweet all the time but when it comes time to do something im never the first friend chosen. I'm not one of those girls who need a guy to complete her, but lately ive been feeling really empty. I don't know what I want. I live with my parents and three younger brothers. My parents are ridiculously strict. They won't let me wear bikinis or cute swimsuits or normal shorts or just tanktops. And they are way overprotective. I used to never care to argue with them but lately thats all i can do. Im so sick of being sheltered and tapered in.I want to be me. I want to be able to be who I truly am. Don't tell me to go to God, because I've been there. I've tried to be a Christian.The truth is I hate it. I grew up having the Bible and God and stupid rules crammed down my throat. I can't take it anymore. Everyone has a breaking point and I've reached mine. I just don't know what to do.

20090205150311AA7KkiL	Family & Relationships;Friends	How would this make you feel?	I have a friend that I have been friends with since we were in grade school. I am now in my mid twenties...The question I have is would you be upset with the friend if she continued to date people you had dated/ slept with in the past? Not that I still have feelings for these people but at the same time, why my ex's? I would never date one of hers especially if I knew that at one point she had strong feelings for that person. She called me today to tell me that she was going on a date with one of my ex's and I felt a pang of jealousy. Not one of the more endearing human emotions but it was there none the less. I am in a secure relationship with my bf of 7 years and we have a daughter together so I don't think what I am feeling has anything to do with me wanting to get back with this guy...Just wondering why she continues to date my past flings and flames. We are talking at least the 5th ex.

20090205150514AAOt6mg	Family & Relationships;Friends	I stole something today, and feel extremely bad?	When I was out with some friends today, we went to a store, and they stole some things while I sort of just looked on. Then, we went to a different store and they stole some sodas. At first, I just watched them, not thinking much about it all. But then, they said, "C'mon man, get one." So, I caved into peer pressure, and stole one of the sodas. Despite the fact that it was just a soda, I immediately felt bad after I stole it. I seriously don't want to do it again. What should I do to makeup for it? I sold some candy to people that wanted some so I could gain back enough money to go back to that store, and buy a soda honestly.      Should I go back and buy one the honest way?

20090205150806AAEM7UF	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is this a good letter to my bestfriend?	I am making a time capsule with my bestfriend, is this a good letter to put in it? if you could comment with some additional stuff to add, i would appreciate that very much.       I wanted to write this letter to you. Hopefully it is something you will read with a smile, make you cry, and keep for a very long time.  This took me a few days to write, and it came from my heart, so you better appreciate it champ haha.  So today, 2-4-09, we were sitting in the back of the earth science room, and I admitted that I was jealous of (friend) haha.  You put your head on my knee and said, awww thanks (my name) , you are seriously jealous of her and that’s really sweet.  I seriously do just want to be your #1 best friend, and I don’t want anyone else to get in the way.  You are the reason I love school so much this year, and I hate that we live so far apart.  I feel honored to know you, (person writing letter to). Ever since we began our friendship in 1997, it has been so awesome to have someone so kind, caring, pretty, funny, generous and loving, to want to spend their time with me. I have never felt worthy of your friendship, but always treasured it close to my heart.  You have taught me a lot. Believe it or not, you are someone I have always wanted to be like. I see your courage, your devoting loyalty to your friends and family, and above all, your unconditional ability to love.  I have loved that over the past few months that I have known you, you were always the person I could turn to. I feel like I am able to talk and share anything with you, we are that close. And that has meant the world to me.  (person writing letter to) , words cannot describe how much I look up to you.  When I was growing up, my mom would describe to me a very loveable person, she would say, “Someone I want you to grow up to be is nice, funny, smart, wise, loveable, funny, pretty, athletic, and many more qualities”.  I would always picture myself being all these things, but now when I think of this, I see a picture of me and you in my mind.  We both have the greatest qualities anyone would ever want, and we should be very proud of that.  You are the perfect best friend, and I am so happy I met you.  I don’t care what you say, we are the same in every way, we both have blond hair, brown eyes, were tall, skinny, funny, and a lot more.  We are the same width and height (haha that just made us sound like squares), and our treasure chests are the same also (if you catch my drift haha). You always make the right decision and always think before you speak.  Those are two key ingredients to the perfect friendship.  With our friendship comes one guarantee, what happens to you happens to me.  If you are ever sad, I am sad for you, if you are ever excited, I am also excited,  if you are about to pee your pants because a joke was so funny, chances are, I already peed haha just kidding, just kidding.  When I talk to you, it’s like shelter, just hearing your voice makes my day shine.  Yesterday brought the beginning, tomorrow brings the end, and somewhere in the middle we became the best of friends.  You have no idea how happy I am that we are best friends.  I would do anything for you and I know you would do the same for me.  No matter where life takes us, you will always be in my heart and on my speed-dial.  You are truly my best friend, through thick and thin, through all our fights, I hope you know that I will always love you like a sister and there is nothing in this world that could ever change that.... I pinky promise =]
20090205150846AAs6OCS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I have a boyfriend that I have been living with for the past 6 months. He has been acting differently.?	We have been together for almost a year. He's a corporate business man who is also pursuing his masters in business (28yrs) and i am a senior in college (21yrs). We are at different levels in our lives. Him in his career and I pursuing one. He is a lot busier than I am and his job is very stressful. But sometimes I have problems trusting him bc he is very good looking, south american and he travels for work a lot. I can tell that with his friends and family he is very loyal and he says whatever he does he says he does it 100%. Like being with me. But I cant seem to stop thinking businessman+travel+good-looking= cheating. He says he sees me in the future and that he works not just for him but for us. I know this trust issue is my problem and I really am trying to get over it because I feel like he is the one for me. But lately it has been kicking in more bc we dont have as much sex, and there just doesnt seem to be the passion that was once there. He says he is going to buy a house for us soon, but I dont know if I should move in like he wants me too because I dont know if our relationship is hurting bc of the stress level of his job and school or just because he has put less efort bc he is comfortable now, or hes seeing someone. The sex is not really satisfying me lately, I'm young and like to have a lot of it, but we end up at 2, 3 if I'm lucky, times a week. Could it be bc his age? But we have seemed to grow closer as friends, I know that all relationships lose that "fire" after a while. But the thing Im thinking is, isnt it a little early? Is he cheating or just stressed?

20090205151451AAP4EeL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's secret has hurt me, what should I do?	I go to school in the mornings and the other day I decided to come home and surprise my boyfriend with some lunchtime fun. When I got there he couldn't get hard and he admitted to having been viewing porn all morning. I had told him before that it bothered me that he masturbates to porn and I had asked him if he would not do it anymore. It hurt me that he was doing it behind my back, out of curiosity I went on his computer to see what it was that he looked at that was worth betraying my trust. I was horrified to find that mixed in with regular porn he had pictures of girls under 18. I confronted him right away about it and he told me that those pictures were from years ago and that the only reason it was in the recent files is because it was in the gallery he has all his porn in and he just flips past it. I don't know if I can believe him though, because he had already proved to be untrustworthy. He deleted all of it off his computer and told me he's willing to go to counselling if I would be willing to give him another chance, I care about him but I'm really hurt and disturbed, I'm not sure what to do, I need some advice please help.

Please note that im dont think i love him or anything crazy like that and i dont really think ill get a relationship out of it,i just really wanted to be set up with him.Thank you.
