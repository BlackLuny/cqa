20080207131652AArPBxR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Saco Gestacional Pequeno?	Meninas , hoje fiz minha primeira ultrasonografia da minha gravidez que foi gra?as à uma FIV....   Os Médicos pedem para contar a gesta??o 14 dias antes da data de retirada dos óvulos, já que por conta da FIV n?o tive menstrua??o...Ent?o segundo às contas dos médicos, eu deveria estar de 5 semanas já.   Mas fiquei sem ch?o quando a médica , ao fazer o ultrassom, disse que o saco gestacional tinha as medidas correspondentes à 4 semana de gesta??o.   Estou com muito medo de perder meu bebê!   Alguém já passou por situa??o parecida? Isso é normal?

A gennaio finalmente cominciamo i colloqui e la presentazione è stata :   "lei (riferendosi a mio marito) Lavora in questa ditta, mi dispiace ma lì sono tutti "capiscioni", i dirigenti fanno il lavaggio del cervello e il modo di vivere di chi lavora per XYZ è contro i miei ideali, quindi difficilmente una coppia che lavora per XYZ potrà ottenere l'idoneità da me!".   Non so come siamo riusciti a fare tutti i colloqui con Assistente sociale, psicologa e medico legale in un tempo decisamente breve (neanche 2 mesi) ma vista l'esperienza iniziale , dopo un mese e mezzo ho chiesto al Tribunale se la pratica, spedita a fine febbraio

Qualche sera fa seguivo Ferrara in tv.Tralasciando le corbellerie che ha detto, a mio personale parere ovviamente, perché molte persone si riempiono la bocca e le teste con l'aborto, preoccupandosi e rimpiangendo tot milioni di non-nati, e nessuno invece si occupa del sistema delle adozioni italiano? Due miei vicini stanno tentando di adottare un bambino perché non possono averne, sono mesi che fanno viaggi, portano incartamenti. Sono d'accordo che controlli e perizie siano d'obbligo, ma oggi addirittura sono arrivati a chiedere alla signora per quale motivo è grassa.   Se ogni donna che abortisce fosse costretta a partorire, quali che siano i suoi mezzi, fornendole magari qualche pacco di pannolini, perché a chi deve adottare viene fatto passare questo strazio?   Non voglio aprire dibattiti sul tema aborto, voglio solo capire questo squilibrio: fai un figlio e puoi morir di fame insieme a lui. Vuoi adottarlo, e guardano anche quanto pesi.      Grazie a chi vorrà rispondere.

20080326135450AAm1vkK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Did anyone else have contractions that felt like this?	I was wondering if anyone else had this during labor.. My contractions weren't really all that painful. There were absolutely no cramps. All I felt was a pressure like the baby was pushing down really hard (whch was somewhat painful, especially once i got to be about 4 cm dilated). I did eventually get the epidural, but not for the contractions. I got it because I was nervous about the actual pushing part and how much it would hurt to push the baby out if I wasn't numb. Of course then that just kind of made things worse bc I couldn't feel to push.. but anyway, I was wondering if anyone else's experience was like mine. I'm hoping for the same thing in a few months with the baby I have on the way

20080903055154AA84mCD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Chi come me ha adottato un bimbo a distanza?	Io e mio marito abbiamo l'anno scorso fatto la scelte di adottare un bambino a distanza per poterlo aiutare ad avere un infanzia meno triste,   Mossi forse anche dal desiderio di un figlio che non arriva.   Vogliamo un bene enorme a Sujita che ha 11 anni, una pittrice fantastica e da grande vorrebbe farsi suora, ogni sua foto e lettera è per noi fonte di gioia.   Mi piacerebbe sapere le vostre esperienze  e idee in merito.   E' veramente un fenomeno di nicchia il sostegno a distanza oppure ormai ha preso piede?   Credete veramente che i soldi arrivino ai bambini oppure siete scettici?

20081026083836AAaih66	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Why do people choose such unique names for their children?	As I read around this board, and even the answers to my own questions about naming my twins, it seems no one chooses 'normal' names. I've seen someone who liked the name Verizon for their child, another who liked 'Seven' for their child. A lot of people seem to make up names too. Why?       I have an 11 year old named Emily Elizabeth, and am I expecting twin daughters, and we are planning on naming them Adeline Violet Christina and Audrey Lynn Hazel. We felt that they were unique, but decent and classic names.      Can anyone shed some light on this for me?

20081222041630AALWWCO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Chi sa dirmi quanto costa un'adozione internazionale di uno-due bimbi bielorussi? Un bimbo bielorusso che ?	conosco molto probabilmente tra poco verrà messo in una casa dei bambini (orfanotrofio penso) perché la tutela legale, tolta alla madre è passata alla nonna che però per colpa di un marito perennemente ubriaco e manesco rischia di vedersi levata la custodia legale del nipotino.   Qualora il bimbo venisse messo in una casa dei bambini, verrebbe dichiarato automaticaamente adottabile, no? Io cosa dovrei fare? Io e mio marito siamo sposati da tre anni e qualche mese, abbiamo due redditi. Io però ho problemi di salute: ansia e quindi prendo ansiolitici e una leggera forma di diabete. Entrambe le cose comunque non mi impediscono di lavorare, gestire una casa, eccetera.    Quale iter dovrei seguire? Quali i costi? Parlo di due bimbi perché se si prende lui non mi sento di lasciare la sorellina alla casa dei bambini.

20090105053751AA4TufI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Adottare un bambino quanto "costa"?	Fino a qualche anno fa credevo che, quando due persone decidevano di adottare un bambino potevano averlo senza scambi di denaro, un pò come quando prendi un cane al canile... (sorry per l'esempio!!)   Poi, ho saputo che i bambini "costano" e anche tanto ma non mi hanno mai detto quanto... Qualcuno di voi, magari anche per esperienza mi saprebbe dire fino a quanto potrebbe "costare" un bimbo??   Immagino che può sembrare una domanda stupida, e con poco senso ma prima non me l'ero mai chiesto...   Grazie mille e sorry!!

This is in pregnancy and parenting because parents have to name their children, so hopfully you all have a lot of ideas.   My sims, Garret and Kelly Sawyer, are going to adopt a baby soon. I don't know if it will be a boy or a girl since, stupidly, you cannot choose.   I don't like names that are too traditional, like Jacob or Michelle, etc. But they don't HAVE to be totally unique. You can suggest a middle name, but I don't know if I'll give him/her one. Thank you in advance!  /Cappie

20090205173823AAa4zO4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	High school mentors for freshmen?	My daughters are entering high school next year and the upperclassmen are chosen to act as 'mentors' for the incoming freshmen. I've heard mixed things about the program from moms in the neighborhood who have been there, but what I know for sure is that the process to get your kids on the list to receive a mentor is pretty lengthy and strenuousness. For some reason there is a HUGE packet of paper work to fill out, and I have four incoming freshmen so it would take a while!      I've heard great things about the program through the school and through other moms, but I've also heard that it isn't too helpful, by the third week of school the mentors don't bother anymore, and because the mentor/mentee pairs are required to have five hours of bonding time, a waste of time.      What do you think I should do?

20090205165952AA7EwM2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do you stop yourself losing your temper with a naughty toddler?	I'm usually pretty calm, but yesterday my 17 month old drove be crazy repeatedly emptying her water/juice/milk over the floor/stroller/herself. She was definitely doing it deliberately and looked at me each time to see what I would do.      The first three times I told her sternly that it was very naughty (not shouting, just a cross tone of voice), and cleaned it up.      The last time, she emptied her juice over some books and I lost my temper, grabbing her by the arm (the one holding the juice) and shouting 'No! Very, very naughty! Go away! (while I cleaned it up)' After that I had to go and sit in the kitchen for a few minutes to calm down, and felt very bad about losing my cool.       I definitely didn't hurt her, and she didn't really seem traumatised by the incident, but I would prefer not to have lost my temper.      How do you keep your cool when a naughty toddler pushes you over the limit, and what are some better forms of punishment?

He wanted to be the best father she could ever have had if her mother had let him.  The only reason why she did no see him allot is because her mother was paying games in family court and he had to fight hard to see her in the courts.   He still wants to have a good relation ship with her and hoped that her mother did not destroy that.  He still wants to be a very good father to her and help her out any way he can.  He lives not very far from her.  He still wants to see her every weak and she can live with her father if she wants to.

20090205165927AAo4k8p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Do you think that this is normal? ?	I am fourteen, and I am in the eighth grade. I have become concerned about my friend Ashley because she's told me some really *weird* things. She told me that she went to her Aunt and Uncle's house recently, and they had a pet dog. She told me she started to touch the dog's ding-a-ling and it ejaculated all over her. Obviously, I was shocked and I asked her why on Earth she would do that. She told me she copied an episode of South Park. I was so shocked, and Ashley told me that she told two other classmates and they reacted normally and says that I am over exaggerating.   Also, I both heard/saw that Ashley has been wearing a ring on one of her fingers and a few people were joking about her marrying a dog. And when I asked her about it, she said something 'zoophilic' (I think she was talking about zoophilia) about a friend's dog.   Also, Ashley has some self-esteem problems and she is extremley shy until she gets to know you. During grade 5 and 6, she was very quiet and in grade 7 and 8, she began to open up once my friends and I became friends with her. She also wrote somewhere on her Myspace/Facebook (not sure which one), she wrote that she's interested in both Women and Men.    Should I be worried about this? Or is she just curious? Should I do something about it or just let her be. I still want to be her friend, and I am just wondering if this is normal (due to everyone else's reaction at school) or what?

He did not ejaculate in though i know you can get pregnant from pre- ejaculation. I have been having all the symptoms. The tender breast, fatigue, bloated, sleeping and tired more often,waking up every morning at 4:30am, head aches, heart burn, #2's a lot(sorry if tmi), moody, wanting to cry for no reason, and lost of appetite, nausea off and on, and vomited twice. My period was suppose to come tomorrow. 2days ago me and him had sex and i started brown spotting the next day. Before we  had sex i was having twinge feelings in my lower abdomen whenever i would sit/lay down for a while. Today i got up to take a hpt and i saw little bit of blood. So i decided to just pee and see what happen. Red blood came out along with the urine.so i didnt test. I have been bleeding today with some cramps. But whenever i push in my lower abdomen with my fingers i feel this thing with pressure move up. And then when i move my fingers i feel it come back down. So i thought maybe that would be my uterus getting bigger, So can i be pregnant and just be 1 of those who bleed during pregnancy? The bleeding is lessoning and kind of becoming lighter. my periods are usually heavy and last 5-6 days.

20090205170953AAja1hN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is there any way at all to be emancipated from my mother-- and bring my sister with me?	I'm 15 years old. I live with my mother and my baby sister. My dad died when I was 4. My mom is a drug addict and sleeps around with a whole bunch of guys. She had my sister 6 months ago and basically leaves me to care for her. Which I love-- I care for my sister as if she was my own daughter. But I'm only 15. I'm in my junior year of high school, I skipped a year. So when I go to school, I worry about my sister. I drop her off in daycare in the morning and pick her up as soon as I'm done school. My mom works part time and so do I. She provides food for us but that's it. I bet my mother doesn't even know how to change my sister's diaper. I don't know anything about emancipation. I know it probably won't happen, but is there a way to separate from my mother and take my sister with me? I don't want children's aid to get involved because they'll take my baby. I'm very mature and could live on my own. My birthday's coming up in a month-- can a 16 year old live on her own? What about with a baby? I know the answer is probably no. :(      But any advice would be great. Thank you, bless you all.

I'm curious to see what people are willing to do to save their child's lives. If you have a different answer then please feel free to give it. Now you can't say run to family....family doesn't exist in this theoretical question.

Won't be the first time this week.  I'm willing to take one for the team when necessary.  And personally I think something a bit lighter is in need.  Maybe I'm the only one but oh well.      So how was your day?  Did you do anything fun?  Did you have a good dinner?  Or what's your favorite color?  Answer this question however you would like.  With any answer you want about any given subject.  Just so I don't have to go to bed thinking about hell.

20090205173246AATG9AX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding for last 3 months, and started spotting today?	I've breastfed my 3 month old exclusively and just went to the bathroom to discover I've started spotting. Is this ok? I've started working out as well, and I'm way out of shape- could this be causing the spotting? Does this affect my milk in any way? Am I really ovulating-- and could I get pregnant?      Any other input is welcome- as I'm new to this whole breastfeeding- I've never made it this long with my other two kids. Thanks in advance for your help!
20090205171350AAJWP7b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	What are the car seat/booster seat laws in your state?	Someone asked the question about how long a child should be in a booster seat and it made me go and check out my own states car seat laws. I always went buy what friends and family said and have not checked them out since 2005. And just discovered in the state of Wisconsin a child needs to be in a car seat until age 4 and my 3 year old has been in a booster seat with a back since 3 1/2! He will not be 4 until this summer. Do you think i should take out his car seat with the harness again? He is going to be really mad if he has to go back into a normal as he calls it (baby seat) car seat. He fits fine in the high back booster it goes across his shoulder in the right place and he sits like a big boy in it because he knows if he doesn't sit like a big boy he will have to go back in the "baby seat" but I do not want to end up getting a fine! If I put him back in the car seat poor little guy is going to think hes getting punished. What is your opinion? Also look up your car seat laws and let me know what they are im interested and make sure that you know them! Thanks!
20090205162118AAstnFi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	My daughter has occasional crying fits that are unrelated to anything that's just happened.?	Once a month or even less, my four year old will just start crying for the slightest thing.  For instance, we were at the planetarium and I lifted her over the seat when she wanted to go around.  She started crying uncontrollably and I had to take her out of the theater.  I asked her why she was crying so much - because it was obvious I wasn't and hadn't been angry with her or anything - and she said she didn't know.  It took her several minutes to get it together enough to go back into the theater.  And she is normally such a well-rounded, well-behaved child.

20090205164306AA0sdpD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Do you like UNISEX Names?	YES this is a serious question.      So I've been noticing a lot of really unisex names being suggested or asked about.  Fair enough, some people like them.  I'm not terribly partial to them.  I like Avery for a boy (so cute :D).      But where is the cutoff point?  At what point do you think a name is inappropriate on one gender?  If Ryan or Parker are okay for a girl why not Matthew or John?  Where is the line drawn between 'cute' and 'ridiculous'.  Where do you PERSONALLY draw the line.      What's the difference between Taylor and, say, Ryder or Phillip for example?  Is there a difference?  Why would you use one for your daughter and not the other.      And why can't the names go in reverse - why aren't we naming baby boys things like Rose and Maria?      List of unisex names: Madison & Addison, Avery, Ryan, Parker, Harper, Mackenzie, Kendall, Aiden, Jayden, Kayden, Brooklyn, Brooke, Lindsey, Ashley, Lesley, Cameron, Bailey, Dylan, Ashton, Hayden, Harley, Campbell, Logan, London, Reese, Reagan, Peyton, Skyler, Taylor and Tyler.        All these names were originally used on male children and gradually became more popular on girls - none of them started on girls and worked their way around to boys.  Why is this?      I'm very curious about the phenomenon of unisex names.

He does that often so I didn't think anything of it, but I turned my head cause I heard my dog behind us and when I turned back to my son he had a handful of foam from his mouth and it was all over his shirt. Sometimes he plays with his spit, but this was too much foam to have made while I looked away. Could he have had a seizure without convulsing or passing out? Ever since then I have been watching him and he is tired (which is unusual for him at this time) He is grumpy as well. I don't know if I'm panicking or is it possible that he had a seizure? If it was, should I take him to the Dr.'s? Just need some advice is all.

I guessed that my due date would be somewhere around August 21st, and my doctor said it would be around August 27th.       In a transvaginal ultrasound, how early can doctors detect fetal heartrate and how accurate is their calculations? I'm curious to know, it should be close to spot on--right?      And for a transvaginal that early, should it detect a close if not spot on guess of the date of conception?

Im going to be having my baby soon, this is #4. me and my husband are done for now after she arrives, but not sure if we would like another later on in the future or not so getting tubes tied or his getting snipped is no option for us.

I dont do well with birth control at all and find myself with crying spells, anger etc. And when my period comes i always end up getting angry,depressed feeling,sad very emotional. so is there ANY birth control out there that doesnt cause mood changes and depression? i dont want the iud, too many friends of mine had problems with those. how is yaz? heard it helps with pmdd symptoms..i dont know what im going to do!

Usually she's up once a night at 6am for a feeding (breastfeeding exc).  For the past few days she has slept 11 hours straight w/o a feed.  Should I just be happy and enjoy this? she still has big pees and poos, but I just spoke to a nurse on the phone and she said I should be waking her every 3 hours for food at night no matter what and go no more than 1.5 - 2.5 hours during the day.  She feeds a ton in the evening, which makes me think she's trying to get really full for her long sleeps.

My baby measured perfectly for every thing, he was moving all over the place and sucking his thumb.  They noticed a "bright spot" on his heart.  It could be a sign for down syndrome.  The ultrasound tech said that 1 in 7 babies have them and they just notice them more these days because the technology is so much better.  Also I did the blood test that told me the odds of having a down syndrome baby and my odds were 1 in 10,000.  Even though he had no other signs I'm still a little worried.

Should I go get offended, raise hell on the internet and then cry in to my Ben and Jerry's while I sob???    No, this is NOTHING to get offended over.     This doesn't show that she hates asians or has any negativity towards them. This is Miley and her friends swapping facial expressions.

But everytime she wakes up ..I nurse her back to sleep..I lay her back down..and she wakes up 10 min later..and does this over and over for about an hour..She'll sleep another two hours and the process starts over.

20090205182224AAmwQRm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What is your opinion?	My "brother in law" is in the midst of a nasty custody battle for his little girl - She was born back in March last year, and the mother has pretty much moved on to a new partner.    Well, he was over not to long ago with his daughter, and said something that kind of caught me off guard.      "I'm looking to date again, but the next girl better realize that my baby is number one with me. She comes second, no questions."      I kinda started thinking about it, and can totally understand with his little girl being so young that he'd feel that way, but kids are pretty smart - They are also pretty possessive as they get older of their mommy and daddy, so if his little princess realizes that she's number one, she could seriously sabatoge any of his relationships as a young kid...       Do you think your kids should come before a spouse or potential spouse? I'm not talking about a fly by night g/f or b/f, I'm talking about the real deal - Your life mate, the one you plan to wake up next to for the next 50 years, have a retirement with, to sit and chat with when your kids have families of their own, etc.      Personally, I don't really know how I feel about it - I'm kind of caught on the age of the child, and the sincerity of the relationship...   What's your opinion?
20090205185019AAriunZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Bamboo, Hemp, or Cotton?	Hemp, Cotton, or Bamboo?   I know this is odd but...      I am making a hammock for my rats. They will be filled with something to help keep them cool in the summer (this something will have a PUL cover so any accidents they make will just drip off). My question is about the outer fabric. I was considering hemp and bamboo cause they are both earth friendly, are likely to not have chemicals, and seem softer. If you don't know what would be comfy for a rat, imagine you had a baby that liked to destroy things. What would you use then? I need something strong but soft.  I came here figuring a natural mom would know best since diapers have to hold up to abuse.      also which one would make the best insert for a diaper and why?      Thank you

My husband called his son today, he lives 8 hours away due to a psycho baby momma who up and left for another man.  She answered and he talked to her about 1st communion stuff then asked to talk to his son.. she said we're busy.  He said I just want to say hi, she then said "get over your ******* self" and handed the phone over to his son, who is 8.  Why would she be mad and say that when he is just trying to talk to his son who he loves to death and misses terribly?  Wouldn't most women in that situation be glad their son has a father who cares about his son AND pays child support on time all the time!  We were just there for 4 days 2 weeks ago for his birthday, spent lots to stay in a hotel and gas and food, and she still wanted us to pay for the party and complained that she had to buy the cake and made the comment that she had paid enough over the weekend, cause we all went to dinner the night before and for some reason she INSISTED on picking up the bill.  I knew it was just so she could ***** about it later and rub it in our face, but she wouldn't let us pay!  Why, why, why is she like this??? I don't understand... anyone???

20090203065043AAvwcEz	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why wont my daughters father sign over his rights?	Ok, I have a 3 year old daughter.  Her biological father has never been in her life, and he is not on the birth certificate.  I am currently in the process of getting child support. We just got our DNA test results back.   He has only seen her 3 times in 3 years, and one of those times his parents forced him to so they could meet her for the first time when she was 2.  Now, I asked a question earlier about my son's father signing my daughters birth certificate because he really wants to out of love for my daughter even tho she isnt his (remember HE wants to, I didnt ask him to).  And most of the answers I got were that it would be illegal becuz he is not the biological father.  But he said he is willing to accept full responsibility for her.  He knows that I would never go after him for child support becuz he is a great father to both my kids even tho we arent together anymore.  But my daughter's biological father refuses to sign over his rights so my son's father can sign her birth certificate.  I dont get it.  He wants nothing to do with his daughter, he has been calling me several times a week asking me to drop the child support case, and dont want no part of her life, but he wont sign over his rights.  Can anyone tell me what might be going through his head, or why he wont sign his rights over?

When my baby was about 3 weeks old, ,I made the transition from breast milk and regular Enfamil formula to just formula. She got incredibly gassy and fussy. I then tried the Gentlease, which helped, but it wasn't enough. My baby was still soooooo gassy, which in turn made her miserable and me frustrated. Anyway, the Dr. put her on the Nutramigen. We saw a great improvement, plus we are using the Dr. Browns. But, she still is gassy and fussy, just not as bad, but enough for me to think that I need to try a different formula. She will drink a TON of formula. She is 11 weeks old, and can drink 4oz every 2-3 hours.   My question is, should I try the soy? Or a different brand of formula altogether?

I remember she was really heavy like i could carry her but my arm was going numb :P (probably cause i was sleeping on it or something) Anyways the last thing in my mind before i woke up was her big brown eyes and her big smile just loving me to pieces .

20090203064820AAtcXDe	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Could it be, Pregnancy????????	Ok, I posted before but now I have more concerns.   My Wife and I are TTC. She was 4 days late on her period ( never has been ) Then after being 4 days late she did have one day she bled a little bit. ( not heavy ) Now, we are 9days past her missed period but one negative, and one that was very faint positive. Today she has had some spotting of brown discharge only when she wipes.   My question is is it possible for her to be pregnant?   We have read a lot on implantation bleeding, and were wondering could this happen this far past her missed period?   She took an ept, and it looked negative. but this morning I looked at it sitting on my sink and it had a blue +.. She got blood work done yesterday and now we are waiting to see.

20090205184243AA5xirJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breast feeding questions..?	Okay I posted a question about breastfeeding a couple days or so ago but now I have more. Basically it was why should I breastfeed and so on, None of my family has ever breast fed so I have no one to talk too.      I am pregnant and think I may want to breastfeed, My mind isn't made up however, I am actually leaning more towards formula.      I was woundering if its ok to breastfeed just for a couple months then go to formula. The reason for this is I am soupposed to take a chemistry class like a week after I am due and I am not sure how safe it is to be dealing with chemicals while breastfeeding, but if I decide to nurse I will postpone it a quarter (which will give me until s/he is 4 months old) then I would have to stop. But the problem with that is it will postpone me nearly 6 months to begin my nursing classes.      Another question I have is if I do breast feed can I formula feed while I am at work, I will most likely wait to go to work a while maybe 6 to 8 weeks but when I do I will just be working one 16 hour shift one day a week. so I don't know how much pumping I would have to do to make up for it. the reason for just one shift is my boyfriend works weekday mornings and I plan to take evening classes and just working one weekend day gives us sundays to spend together as a family :) and If I do go to school I will be gone 2-3 hours a evening so should I just pump then or what.      Also with my last post someone implied I would end up not going to school but, That is not an option seeming how I will be living on campus and it is a must. So any advice anyone? Sorry so long I just really don't know anyone who had breastfed so I am starting from scratch. Thanks too all.

20090205184849AAPJlCt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	21 month old tantrums...?	These tantrums are pretty much lasting all day long.  It is sooo frustrating to me because i'm here all day every day with him.  My husband works away so most of the time it's just the two of us.  He is going through separation anxiety right now and will not stay with anyone else for me to get a break.  I just don't know what to do with his nonstop whining.  It's over pointless stuff.  Here's an example:  It's lunch time and to avoid any crying, i have lunch already made just waiting for him to ask for it or for it to be time.  So, I put him at the table, he whines and scream he wants down so i'm like okay and i'll put him down, then he'll cry to eat...so i'll put him back at the table and he'll cry to get down again. i get so frustrated that i'll put him in his chair and walk away...just a few steps so i can still see him...eventually he will calm down and eat.  but what was all the fuss about to begin with.  why does he cry for one thing then doesn't want it.  this is with every single thing throughout the day.  i know about terrible twos but this is extreme.. is anyone else going through this kind of thing with their toddler? It's almost like he is whining without even realizing it.  Nothing makes him happy.  There is only a few hours in the day where he acts happy and of course this breaks my heart.  I am a good mother and I spend lots of time with him playing, etc.  I just don't understand what the problem is to even fix it.  It seems like everything I do makes it worse.  any advice on how i can avoid these tantrums? or any advice on keeping myself sane????

I am So embarrased to even talk about this, but I have no idea what is going on...I need help! I do not have medical, so I cannot go to the doctor unless it is VITAL that I go. I noticed when I took a shower...I was washing down there in the vaginal region and it burned a bit. It was not all over, just at the hood. It was almost as if I was cut right there, it is really red, and like I said...it BURNS when I try to wash it. I do not have any STDS period, so "stupid" people, please don't say it is. I was wondering if it could be a yeast infection? If so, would it cause a cut like sore right there where it is at?? Or could my birth control cause this, I am using the Mirena. PLEASE PLEASE help me!!!!      I am POSITIVE it is not, I have been with my fiance for 2 years. I just had a baby 4 1/2 months ago...they test you for STDS in the beginning of your pregnancy. I do shave, but I have not shaved in a little over a week, so why would it hurt now? I read online somewhere that if you experience leakage, abnormal discharge or sores when using the Mirena to consult your doctor...I plan to, just wanted to see if any of you knew what this is.

20090205190304AA3iBoW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Miscarriage? Please Help.?	Okay, here is my story....    On Jan 14th I took an HPT and it was negative, another on the 17th and it was also negative, so on the 17th when I started to bleed I assumed it was my period. This lasted for 14 days when I finally went to the ER where they told me I was pregnant. My HCG level was 151, they did not know if I had JUST gotten pregnant or if I was miscarrying. Anyway I went back to the ER the next day and my levels HAD went up however they could not find the baby on the ultrasound. I went home and waited over the weekend while still continuing to bleed (now this bleeding has been basically spotting throughout the whole thing). On Tuesday I was still "spotting" and I went to my Reg. Dr. To get some more testing done, my HCG level had went up AGAIN, but they still could not find the baby on the ultrasound. Now I am basically resigned to the fact that I have had a miscarriage, but does ANYONE know what is going on with my body? I cannot find anyone who will give me any answers. Why are my levels continuing to rise? HOW long am I going to continue to bleed? I have been bleeding from the 17th of Jan. and it is now Feb 5th!!!! How long will my levels continue to rise? Is it NORMAL for your levels to continue to rise after this long? Any info would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

20090205185929AAIAq6m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What is the funniest thing that happened to you while you were pregnant?	Here’s mine. I was about 8 weeks along and just getting to where I was always thirsty and had to make constant bathroom stops. I live about a 15-20 min  from Portland Oregon and never went in to the city on my own because I hate city traffic. One night I had to run an errand which required me to go in to Portland and my boyfriend couldn’t go with me. (He usually drives because I get lost.) It was about 7 pm so I figured it was safe being as rush hour was pretty much over. So I go run my errand which was a pretty quick in and out thing and start heading back home, I had my navigation system on and had no problem (for once!) finding my way back to the highway. The navigation system tells me when there is traffic accidents or congestion whenever I am in the city and it starts saying “traffic accident ahead expect 5 minute delay”. So no big deal right  5 minutes! WRONG!! I was less than a mile from the on ramp to HWY 26 (which is the one I needed to take to get home) when my nav system said this and it took me OVER 45 minutes to get to the highway! The thing is like I said I was pregnant and always thirsty and always had to make bathroom stops. So after spending 45 minutes just waiting to get on the highway I still had another 20 minute drive home and by the time I got to the highway I was about in tears and contemplating just pulling over and squatting on the side of the road screw what the thousands of people driving by think right? Haha. So anyway halfway home I am bawling because I have to pee and lucky me there is a hospital right off the highway so what do I do?  Well I pull in to the emergency entrance because F*** it right, any lady that’s been pregnant knows what Im talking about… this was an emergency, so I pull in to the emergency entrance and make about 4 passes through the parking lot before I find a space and take off hauling *** in to the ER to find a bathroom. I wish I had a picture of the confused security guard at the front doors face after I ran in like there was a big emergency and calmy walked out less than 3 minutes later and got in my car and left!      So I want to hear your stories, points for the best answer!!

20090205190429AALmhC5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How soon can early pregnancy be detected? Are these early symptoms?	I missed a pill Sunday evening.  Am in the 2nd week of my pack and had sex twice during the weekend.  Before that it was probably 2 weeks although I'm sure my husband would say it was longer.  Monday evening I was having terrible cramping and diarrhea and started spotting.  Tuesday, very crampy and nauseous and tired.  Tuesday night, severe cramping and lots of gas/bloating.  Wednesday still nauseous and bloated and crampy.  Today, still campy and nauseous and bleeding.  Now I am scared that I am pregnant.  After reading early symptoms I realize that this morning in the shower my nipples seemed dark and was complaining the other day that my breasts were tender.  Am I freaking out or could I be prego?  I have been getting my period a week early for the last few months it seems and I typically only have cramps while ovulating (not durring my period) that have been getting more severe.  Either way I am going to the doctor tomorrow... the pain is moderate to severe and I am having trouble eating & sleeping.
20090205190329AAIWCtb	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I just know im pregnant, intuitively...what is your opinion?	Ok, I have done buttloads of research, and with all my previous and newly acquired knowledge, hearing others' stories, PLUS my multitude of symptoms...and a strong intuition, i just know im pregnant! The thing is though, i have had a period, or wat seemed to be a period, and i have taken 2 pg tests that came out negative. I have read about and heard soooo many stories, including my own mother, that they've taken up to 4 tests that came out negative, and yet they turned out to be pregnant after all, ven negative bloodtests! (craziness) And i have also heard many many...too many stories about women who have periods during the first trimester (people i personally know, and not implantation) and women who have them all throughout their pregnancies. Now the reason,, besides intuition and just feeling completely COMPLETELY DIFFERENT, the reason i believe i am pregnant is because i usually urinate about 2 or 3 times a day...4 at the most. for the past 10 days or so, its been increased SIGNIFICANTLY! today, i have already urinated 16 times! No pain nvolved, except a little bit of soreness when i wipe. I have never ever peed so much in my entire life. I am always thirsty, even if I just drank a bottle and a half of water. My appetite is HUGE now, i am a small person (18 by the way), i have always loved food but i am ALWAYS ALWAYS hungry now! Even when i feel like i have to puke i am starving. Sometimes i do struggle to even keep water down. I get random nausea and dizziness, i randomly have mild to bad headaches, lower backaches and abdominal "fluttering" wen i lay down and mild cramping and constant uncomfortableness. My bobs seem to be bigger, or definitely heavier, and they are more sensitive than they have ever been, they never even get sore during my period, theyre always fine and normal, but walking downstairs is painful most of the time now, and mostly my nipples are extra sensitive.  I am always bloated, whwn I touch my stomach it just feels different, like its full when i havent eaten. I really have minimal energy, i feel like i could go for a nap at any moment, and im not a nap person. And idk wat this means, but just sitting down my vagina hurts, not alot, but i can definitely feel a difference. If i am pregnant, my baby was either concieved December 18, Jan 6, Jan 8, Jan 10, or Jan 11...i just dont believe these urine tests, i feel pregnant i have a strong feeling about it, this would be my first pregnancy, but i know my body.  I am going to get a blood test. Anything similar out there, and wat does this sound like to you?

20090205191326AApwCqI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Seriously people, Birth Control help, can anyone supply me the answer I'm looking for?! please..?	First sign of bleeding was friday, January 30th, took my first pill then.   It has been exactly one week of being on birth control.   My period just ended today, thursday February 5th.      I've been in a relationship for a while and my boyfriend and I have both been discussing sex without a condom.   Since I'm now on Birth Control, and my period just ended, well isn't there not an egg ready to be fertilized yet?    And are my chances against me on being "safe" without a condom?
