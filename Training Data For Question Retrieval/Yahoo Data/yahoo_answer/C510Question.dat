Lately, I've been feeling really depressed due to stress from work, school and just life in general. I want to see a doctor about this and perhaps try anti depressants. But I really don't want my parents to know about this. (Please don't tell me that the best thing would be to tell my parents, believe I know that it is but it really isn't an option in my case) My question is if I do go see a doctor and get a prescription, will my parents find out?       Because i know when I go to the dentist, we always get a statement from the insurance company telling us what was done and the cost to us and to our dentist.       I was wondering if the same thing happens with doctor appointments.

20090219171732AAfM7Fh	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Why is my neck and upper back making bone cracking sounds, ever since I went to chiropractor visits?	In late October of 2008, by a wrong neck-spinal-muscular movement, I had a stiff neck that lasted two months since that accident, along with slight pinching tingling pain in my upper back (right next to the neck), especially when I moved my neck forward with my chin almost touching chest or when I leaned my head back with chin in the air, also sometimes I would feel very very subtle tingling in my right arm.    I was worried, so I did some research on the internet about similar symptoms, and I figured going to a chiropractor would be the best solution. At my second visit to the chiropractor, they cracked my neck to the left and then to the right, and then had me lay on my front body, and they did some kind of pushing and cracking on my upper back next to my neck. The day after, I couldn't even move my neck because it became really stiff, and this was in late November of 2008. The chiropractors where telling me I had a loss of cervical curvature. I cancelled the chiropractor appointments, and the next month (in December), I went to my doctor, the neck pain and stiffness was starting to go away at the time, and prescribed me anti-inflammatory cream.    THE TINGLING IS 100% GONE, THE PINCHING IS 90% GONE (I'll feel a very very subtle pinch in my upper back every once in a while), BUT EVER SINCE I had that chiropractor visit, my neck and upper back bones are always easily making cracking sounds, I never had that condition in my life before that!      Why am I having this cracking problem?   What is causing it?   How can I solve it?   How can I treat it?   I THANK ALL INPUT EVEN IF THESE QUESTIONS AREN'T FULLY ANSWERED                                                                     ***THANK YOU***

20090203105752AAKUAsl	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Is it possible to be allergic to another person?	Almost every time my 18-year-old sister sleeps over, my husband gets painful gas and overheated at night and cannot sleep.  It's been happening for a couple of years now and she sometimes comes over as many as three nights a week because it's easier to do homework at our place.  At first I thought it was in his head, but I can literally hear his stomach making all sorts of noises, he farts a lot more (TMI) and has flu-like symptoms.  I thought maybe we eat differently on those nights, since she is picky, but it's not the case.      She's a good kid overall (does well in school), but she's always trying to get a rise out of us about things she does that she knows we disapprove of (telling stories about hooking up, smoking out, etc.).  In addition, she picks fights and debates about stupid things and he buys into it--they will argue about unimportant things for 30 minutes or more until they're both in a bad mood.  It really stresses us both out, because I helped raise her and he's been like a big brother/father-figure to her since she was eight (she would come over with my other little sister to go to church with us every weekend until she quit church).      Could the stress be causing his physical symptoms?  I've never heard of stress or anxiety causing gas, but I'm a bit desperate here.  I can't sleep when he's tossing and turning, but I don't want to keep my little sister away, because at least if she's with us, she's not getting herself into trouble.

It has tremendously worked for my Anxiety, and I have not have a panic attack since I've went up to 75 mg.   But the problem is depression, obsessive thoughts, or intusive thoughts.   I've went from 25 to 50 to 75mg, and I only notice it work a couple days I increase the dose.   I was incredibly happy last week, because the 75 kicked in, and just because I felt like how I used to feel, and then all of a sudden this week I'm back to the depressed me, intrusive thoughts.

I don't know if I want to give 100 a chance, because I get all good feeling, I love my life, and everything I have  blah blah blah, then I go back to depression.      Anybody else been on a anti depressant and have this happen? What did you do?

20090203105240AALjUrc	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I've broken my foot but why the lack of pain?	This may sound like an idiotic question but it is bothering me. I broke my foot 2 weeks ago and am now in plaster for six weeks. For the first 10 days it ached and throbbed as I expected it to but for the last 3 days I have felt no pain WHATSOEVER even as I go about doing daily tasks. This concerns me as I am only a third of the way through my recovery so surely there should still be considerable pain. I've been imagining all manner of things as to the lack of pain. It's not a circulation issue - I can wiggle my toes and have full feeling in the foot. My biggest issue with this lack of pain is that I feel even more encouraged to walk on it even though I have been told not to.      One final note - I haven't taken any painkillers at all since I broke the foot because I react badly to the codeine in them.      Any suggestions would be appreciated as I really feel this can't be normal.

I am a healthy person and I work really hard for my family, anyways a little over 3 year ago I had some rectal bleeding, there was no pain and it was bright red and lasted only a few days. it happened again a year later with the same symptoms. I over looked all this as there was no pain and it went away after a few days. but now that it has happened again I'm not going to over look it, last week I had sever abdominal pain that lasted about ten minutes and then I had the sudden urge to use the restroom and had diarrhea but with no blood(not sure if it's related to the bleeding or not) that night I ate habanero peppers with my meal and the following day had bright red blood come out, this lasted for 3 days and the blood was mainly on the toilet paper and in the toilet staining it red but also has been on the stool. it went away for a day but then reappeared today. I do plan on seeing a doctor as soon as I'm back in town although I have no health insurance and I'm not really sure where to start either (I want to go to the main guy who will help me asap) should I go to the ER? will they beable to determine anything there?        I just wanted to know if anyone has had these problems and what they might be? where to go? and could the ER determine anything at the hopital? or would they have to send me somewhere else?    I'm always working and have little time to run around thats all I know there is a long list of things it could be but  I'm just looking for some advice here. thank you.

For about a month now I've been having a horrible pain in my leg [feels like it could be my muscle] every time I start to walk long distances & and it started in my knee.      My Doctor said it could be a blood clot because of my birth control but a week later I went in to get a pap and THAT Doctor said that she didn't think it was a blood clot or I would have different symptoms.      I'm soppose to go in about 1-2 to get that checked out, but as of now I'm wondering what could this pain really be?

20090220144341AAr5WGO	Health;Women's Health	Birth Control  Question?	I have been taking Loestrin 24FE tablets for the past 6 months. Up until this month, I have had no problems. This month, I had my period at the beginning of the month as usual. Then I got the stomach flu mid month and I missed a pill. The day after missing the pill I started again. So, I took two pills to catch up. I thought that would stop my period, but it didn't. It was only 10 days after ending my first period of the month. I have missed a pill before and I didn't start the next day. Is this normal?

20090219180706AARO7Y0	Health;Diet & Fitness	How do I keep motivated while trying to lose weight?	I'm not fat - in fact, I love my body. But the one thing I've never felt confident about is my stomach. I have a tendency to eat when I'm bored, whether I'm hungry or not, or I just get a craving for a certain kind of food - and usually, it's not exactly the healthiest.   I have trouble keeping myself motivated to eat less often and to eat healthier foods. I'm going with my school on a trip to Disney soon, so I've tried to tell myself that I have to try and look good by then. I also tell myself that I want to look good for my boyfriend and that eating junk food isn't good for my health - but I still can't seem to resist reaching for the cookies and ice cream.   I have some Pilate's videos by Mari Winsor which are effective, but I only like to do them when I'm in the mood and I have trouble getting motivated to go and work out.   I find that diets help me lose weight, but I feel like I can't enjoy the foods I like and that I'm eating small portions. As soon as I'm off the diet, I slowly gain the weight back, which I know isn't healthy.   How can I keep myself motivated to exercise and reach for healthier foods?
20090219182918AAxhAI1	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Dr. told me i have a lot of inflammation in my Temporomandibular joint?	He prescribed my panadine fort and a strong slow release anti inflammatory proexen. He told me to keep this treatment for 2 weeks and if it doesn't help me is sending me to a oral surgeon. I asked what it is and he just said inflammation in my joint. I was just wondering why he is only trying to mask the symptoms then fix it? he said something about it being Temporomandibular joint disorder. If it is that is this the right treatment?    I just feel like he is trying to mask the problem then fix it.

I have had almost constant stomach pain, which feels like hunger pains, since I had a case of the flu 2 weeks ago.  At first I thought it was because I hadn't eaten much when I was sick, but that didn't help.  If I eat, the hunger pains are still there, but then I feel uncomfortable like I've overeaten.  This is weird to me, because I'm feeling full and hungry at the same time!  My stomach even growls.  I've tried drinking more, eating more protein, eating more veggies and fruit, and eating more grains.  Nothing seems to help.        I was diagnosed about 2 months ago as hypothyroid, and all other tests came back normal (including blood sugar tests).      Does anyone know what causes this, and how to stop the pain?  I'm almost to the point of stopping eating, because at least that's only 1 pain, instead of 2.

I've tried to take my mind off of it if i get bored or something and feel a craving coming on, i've tried drinking water or having a glass of milk as well, but 5 mins later another craving comes, and i put it off for as long as i can, taking a bike ride or something, but..eventually i give in, and i feel like crap afterwards.   please, does somebody have anything that perhaps worked for them?   and i've tried talking to a close friend about it but she doesn't realize how bad binge eating is i guess..or how bad it is for me..i just feel like it takes over my life sometimes..and my behavior toward other people.   thank you in advance for the help.

20090220174145AAjP8Z2	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Is cancer really curable?	I had breast cancer last year when i was 26 and now i am cancer free.  Although i am cancer free now i feel that it does not mean anything.  I feel that i am going to die from it in the next few years.  It seems to me as though no one survives this disease.       And unfornately i had the worst kind of cancer called Triple Negative.  This type of cancer is very difficult to treat.  Chemo is the only thing that will cure it, but it seems to me as though chemo does not work.  If it does then how come so many people have recurrences?  It is EXTREMELY difficult for me to go through this with a positive attitude when i see everyone who gets cancer have a recurrence and most of them end up dieing from it.        My chemotherapy oncologist have already informed me that if the cancer returns again that i am going to die.  Since she has said this i do not feel any need to go to any of my follow-up appointments now.  It is just useless to go.  People with triple negative breast cancer have a higher rate of developing metastasis cancer later and dieing from it.  I feel that there is no hope for me.  i feel that i might as well be realistic and just prepare myself to die in the very near future.  I hate that it has come to this.  I am only 27 years old and now i am going to die.  I hate that there is nothing i can do about this.

Also, when ever I turn the lights off, I turn them back on because otherwise I feel uncomfortable.   One time, I even hit my wife because she put our pillows in the wrong order. We got rid of my wife's dog (which she owned for most of her life) because he didn't pee at the right time on our walk. He usually pees on the second block, but this time he waited until the fourth.   I even disowned my own son because he decided that he wanted to move to a town other than the one I picked for him to live in.      Would you consider this OCD?

20090220182219AABcwhd	Health;Diet & Fitness	Eating Instant Noodles Uncooked?	Hi! I have a very bad habit of eating uncooked instant noodles INSTANTLY, I just crush them up in the bag and add the salt flavoring. I am currently eating the "MAMA" Noodles (made in Thailand), it's soooo good. People think it's disgusting.. only because they haven't tried it, so they need to shove a sock in it.      But my question is, is it healthiER or unhealthier to eat them uncooked. By the way, I think it should be healthier because I only add the salt and spice, but not the oil packets they give us to give it extra flavoring.       (I eat like three bags a day!)
20090220184307AAGeQtS	Health;Diet & Fitness	How hard is it to lose 30 pounds?	I am 5'4, currently 160, and a 16 year old male. I've been fat for years and this new years res I wanted to change that so I change my eating habits and lost 10 pounds (I was 170). So after 8 weeks I lost 10 pounds, that's a little over 1 pound a week. If I go on till the summer and reach around 145 pounds, will losing weight by just eating healthy be allowed, or will I plateau. The only reason I think I can lose 10 pounds with basically not do much exercise at all and just eating very well is because I am very overweight (Almost obese). Also being a 16 year old male helps times a billion. After losing 10 pounds I feel like I am 10 again and can actually do things without being lazy with it. But once I lose 20 pounds, will I have to kill myself in cardio to get the other 10 or maybe even 20 off?

Okay so I wasn't really on planning to do anything tonight but I decided to hit up the clubs tonight. I approached a couple of ladies in their mid twenty's and asked them to dance, however they said "Were waiting on someone". So then I lacked a little confidence, which I do have but after a rejection it's tough to rebound. Then I ask another woman to dance and it so happens she tells me she's a lesbian. And she just wasn't saying that, I saw her make out with another girl and grind with her girlfriend. Also I called this one girl who seemed interested to at least hang out and she hasn't had the common curtsy to even call back. I have called twice and no response. This has happen with other girls.         I do have a high self-esteem and believe I'm a tall, muscular and handsome man with a good personality. I even told one of the girls how beautiful she looked tonight and she said "Thank You". I don't push it, but I just don't understand women of what they want. I thought they grew out of the stage where they want a tough guy and would prefer a sensitive guy who can protect and treat them like a queen.      May I ask what I'm doing wrong?      Thanks in advance.

20090220183219AAx89Wh	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Umbilical Hernia - anyone had one?	When I went to my OBGYN for my annual exam my dr said that I have an umbilical hernia (belly button). It is not very big, there is a small bulge in my belly button (not noticeable unless you look very close) however since I just had a baby in August I figured my belly button just hadnt gone all the way back in. My dr said that he didnt think it was urgent to get operated on just yet but he advised me if I lift something heavy or cough or sneeze hard there could be a complication and would need emergency surgery.   My questions to anyone who has had one or knows about these:   How urgent is having the surgery? How severe is the operation? I have a 6 month old and would need to do heavy planning before going out of commission at all.   How would another pregnancy affect the hernia if it is not operated on?   What if I had the surgery and got pregnant again, would it just tear it again?

20090220191705AAMySLM	Health;Women's Health	What can I say to my friend who had a miscarriage?	My best friend had her first miscarriage a year ago.      She was really upset- she still is.      Her husband has not supported her properly and whenever she gets upsets he just tells her to stop crying and live with it.   She wants to try for another baby but he keeps making excuses and putting it off.      Nowadays she is very reserved and she doesnt seem like the bonny girl I once knew...   I personally think she has not had the chance to grieve properly.      When I went to visit her after her miscarriage, I myself was heavily pregnant with my fourth child.     My husband said it probably was not a good idea to visit her if I was pregnant whilst she just lost her child because it would probably make her feel worse- but I had no choice- she needed my support.      When my friend comes to visit me, she spends time with all of my 3 kids BUT she never plays with my 5 month old son.  She just sits and stares at him with a sad but dazed look on her face...      What can I do to make her feel better?   I dont want to broach the subject about her miscarriage in case she doesnt want to talk about it...      I hate seeing her so upset and sad when she is around my children...      Please help me to help my best friend...

20090220192139AA2k78n	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	MUTIPLE SCLEROSIS? ..........?	I'm 16 years old.   In the end of December/early January, I was sick. I had bronchitis, tonsilitis, and gastritis. I was having these episodes every night for about a week, I went to four different hospitals. All they would say is that it's a panic attack. And one said it's acid reflux.   Okay, so it went away after that. Now, on Valentines day, I was with my boyfriend in the city about to go out to eat at Chevy's, and I had another episode. I felt like I was taking a hot shower and the water just turned ice cold, and that feeling of being able to breathe but in a gasping way, just came to me. It didn't stop. I was feeling weak, I was stumbling and I felt like I was gonna faint. My heart was beating so fast, and I felt like I was in another world. Everything felt so unreal, my boyfriend was so scared and he called my mom. These episodes last for about 2 hours and always happen around midnight.   It happened again last night.   I went to the hospital.   They said it sounds like an anxiety disorder, and they said I should see a therapist. I know for a fact that it's not this, I don't know what it is, but I know it's not this. I barely have any stress, I'm a super happy person, I have no anxiety, and I especially wasn't upset when I was about to go to a Mexican resturant (my favorite food) on Valentine's day! And honestly, I know I shouldn't be saying this, but I know theres something wrong, and each time these episodes happen, they get worse, and I'm not gonna wait until it's too late.   I got my blood and urine checked, nothings wrong. I got a chest exam, nothing. I'm schedualed for an MRI on saturday, and something called an EEG? on tuesday, and than if anything I need to get hooked up on a monitor to my brain for 48 hours.   I know you probably will say "wait it out" but I'm going to the doctors in 20 minutes, and he wanted me to look it up so we could think about all the possible tests out there, because he thinks I'm a smart girl and he knows this isn't all in my head. Unlike all the other doctors, he doesn't treat me like I'm an immature baby. I know what I'm feeling.   I'm just afraid if I give in to these "panic attack" theories, I'm gonna end up .. dying .. I'm foolish, I know, but I'm 16 and everything is wrong with me!   Do you think this could be mutiple sclerosis?

But my mom doesn't like the fact that I am on this diet. I am 13. She says I am a growing girl and need full meals everyday. Whereas the Special K diet has you eat a bowl of Special K cereal in the morning, a snack a few hours later, a meal bar, a snack a few hours later, then dinner is your choice. You can also switch the 'your choice meal' from dinner, to lunch, to breakfast, anytime. I thought this was the best diet ever. It would be so easy to manage; and it has. But I recently fainted and my mom thinks I need to eat more. I dont think it was the diet, but she does. She says its up to me if I want to continue on the diet or stop. What should I do?
20090220223631AAjdpVW	Health;Dental	Wisdom teeth removal.  Im a tad Scared...so tell me what your experience was like?	I am getting all four of my Wisdom teeth pulled next wednesday....Im 19 and they are growing in straight...but they are a bit impacted.  The dentist told me a was luckier than other people and that It shouldnt be too difficult.      He said that it was going to take maybe 1 1/2 hours for everything...but the procedure would only take 30 to 45 min.      I am still not sure whether or not I want to be put under or If I just want my mouth numb with laughing gas.      My biggest fear is that Ill be totally aware of everything going on, but I wont be able to move and let them know that I am feeling pain.        He told me that I wont be sleeping, and that I will respond to commands like opening my mouth...but that I wont remember anything....And that kinda freaks me out.  Will I know what Is going on?      And If I dont want to be put under...Will I hear my teeth being pulled out?  Because I think Id throw up at squishing sounds in my ear...      Any stories, and opinions are greatly appreciated.

Feels like it's pressing up on something (If I am, I'm 3 months.)   Nauseated off and on.   Mild cramps without period.   Boobs hurt sometimes. (Mostly nipples)   Intuition on pregnancy...but i don't wanna get my hopes up.   My belly/abdomen is getting a bit bigger.   I'm a very petite girl. Around my waist, I would say 28 inches usually, but I measured it, and it's about 33 inches.   I spotted after I had sex.   I have no desire for sex. (It doesn't hurt or anything.) Just not in the mood.   Feels like there's a rock in my uterus.   I pee alot. And when I do, it feels like something is on my bladder.   My belly twitches (and if you think it's pregnancy, why is my belly twitching sometimes?)   Also, I get gas-like bubbles....without the gas?   I took tests...and it comes out neg.    I heard it's actually common for women's hcg levels to spike until later on in the pregnancy.   I'm so convinced I'm preggo, I started taking Folic acid and Omega 3.   I don't mind if im preggo or not, so im not anxious about it at all. I just have something saying that I am. And everytime I picture getting an ultra-sound and seeing it blank with no baby, for some reason, I think it impossible.   Would I feel so strongly about this if I wasn't? =/         Idk if it's a cyst, or pregnancy, or what.   Can you please give me your opinion.

I am currently in grade 9 and doing a powerpoint project on a Blood Unit, more specifically an inherited disease called Thalassemia (more commonly known as Cooley's Anemia or just Anemia). I read somewhere that some kinds of Thalassemia are from Hemoglobin E or S combining with the Thalassemia. (Hb E mixing: called "E beta Thalassemia". Hb S mixing: called "Sickle beta Thalassemia")   (Hb=>Hemoglobin)   I then read up on what Hb E or S was, I found out there are other letters I do not remember that are called Polypeptide Globin Chains. I do not understand what these are or what they have in common with Thalassemia, and my best guess is that they are some type of protein attached to the Hb.    Please help me because I need help for this project and no sites have helped me so far.    Thank you very much!   PS: I LOVE SCIENCE (L)

I'm just wondering, since I'm tired of being jumpy and constantly visiting the toilet whenever my period is SUPPOSED to come, and would appreciate a more accurate way of measurement.

20090220224700AAEDBIm	Health;Mental Health	I Think I Have Depression?	For the past few years, I've been battling with plaguing feelings of hopelessness and a lack of like for anything. It'll go away for a little while, but it always comes back. I've been picked on a lot in my life and had some pretty horrible things said to me and have moved so much that I have no sense of home or true friendship. It went away for a little while, but now it's back again and I feel so horrible for so much of the day. One friend noticed and offered to try to cheer me up, yet this same friend, along with several others, just watched someone be horrible to me and did nothing. I keep feeling like I don't deserve to be in this world and that nothing good will ever happen to me. I've stopped hanging out with my friends. I have no interest in sports that I used to love. And I cry a lot. I feel like hell.   I can't talk to my parents about this because I don't want to burden them, and I also don't want to look so weak.   What can I do on my own without alerting anyone? Please don't tell me to tell my parents... that just isn't an option yet.   Please help me.

20090220225118AAa6yAg	Health;Diet & Fitness	How is it possible for me to be losing an above average amount of weight per day?	I keep reading different things about weight loss and it says to lose one pound you have to burn 3500 calories. Also it says the average person burns around 1500 calories a day.  I eat a healthy lunch like a sandwich from Subway, and I eat a healthy dinner fish or chicken, and vegetables and sometime rice plus all I drink is water.  I work out between 2 and 3 hours a day just walking and cycling usually an hour to an hour and a half of each.  I burn 1000 calories or less a day working out, but with the average calorie burn of 1500 plus 1000 I could not lose a pound a day, but I seem to be losing 1 to 2 pounds each day! How is this possible?

20090220225606AApaufZ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Cancer Worry and Insurance?	I'm afraid I may have skin cancer on my stomach but I won't have health insurance until August or September. I'm worried that if I go in before I get insurance and have it checked out and it comes back as cancerous, then I won't be covered later on when I do get insurance. I believe this to be true because I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder before I had health insurance a few years back and because I wasn't diagnosed while I had insurance, my medication wasn't covered. So when I had insurance after that, they wouldn't cover my medication because it was a preexisting condition. Would this be true for if I had cancer? Should I wait until I get insured before I find out if I have cancer or not?

I have a severe open bite and need a corrective jaw surgeon and orthodontic work on my teeth. Is it possible for me to get a good coverage from  Medi-cal?

When i turned 18, i suddenly mellowed out, im unusually calm, it now takes a lot to get me angry,  and even then im just mildly frustrated...

For about the past week, I've been getting shooting pains randomly throughout the day in the lower-middle part of my stomach. I'm 3 weeks away from getting any period or anything, so it's not cramps. Cramps also do not hurt this badly nor are they so sharp and sudden. The pain usually happens around mid-morning and then about two hours after lunch through the rest of the night every couple of hours or less and each time lasts from 15 minutes to 30 minutes, dulling and spiking in intensity. The pains happen just a tiny bit above where period cramps usually happen.

20090221010609AAjZVzO	Health;Mental Health	What are my friend's psychotic episodes?	My friend is generally not suicidal, although she is often very depressed. However, she has these sort of "seizures" where (apparently) she falls asleep, then becomes really active and starts hurting herself (scratching, knife, etc) and if you try to stop her she'll shove you away and resume.      The weird part is that she never remembers these episodes. It's like she's sleepwalking, but far more active (e.g. resisting my stopping her with all her strength). They are getting more frequent lately. Once she "woke up" with a knife in her hand and got really freaked out.      Any ideas? The doctor said they were seizures but that doesn't make any sense to me.

I was kicked by a horse about six years ago and never went to a doctor because there was no swelling or anything that concerned me. I just hurt like hell at first. I did notice that the feeling didn't come back completely right above my ankle, where there's some barely noticeable dead skin. It started to kind of ache from time to time about two years ago, but I could take care of it with a stretch or a pop. Lately it's been worse, shooting into my foot and even up to my knee. I can't make it go away anymore...it's not horrible, just a little foot headache. Should I go to the doctor, or am I just screwed that I never did?    I have been working out lately, could that have irritated it? And why the hell does it hurt now?

20090220232354AAivc1h	Health;Mental Health	The act of rescuing cats should make me feel happy but turns out I feel more depressed than ever?	I like to rescue cats, bear the cost of medication and stuff but when it doesn't work out, I feel even more sad. Supposed caring for cats make me feel happy but it says the things that you like the most break your heart the most.         Mum say maybe it's better that I stopped because I couldn't seem to handle the pain quite well. It took a lot of time for me to recover should something bad happen. It gets worse when it happens so many times. The hardest part is if the cat ran away and die.         I preferred to be able to bury it as a final stop. Like it's been concluded and sealed, otherwise I feel harder to let go.         What's your opinion or thoughts on this. I just need to know if there's anybody out there like me or is there anything I should do. I like rescuing cats but I feel depressed doing the things I really enjoy. I have the space and the money though so it's not a constraint.
20090220233054AAZVRPZ	Health;Other - Health	Smoking pot becoming commercialzed?	I've noticed how much smoking weed has become a part of mass media culture over the past couple of years. I mean obviously people have been doing it forever, but I can remember how few kids my age smoked when I started as a freshman. Like I'm talking single digits here. Now I look back at my high school and it seems like everyone is doing it. It's as common or more common than alcohol among guys. It really disturbs me because I've come to the conclusion that people are smoking weed now for the same reason they all dance to the new song of the week: not because of how it makes you feel, but simply because everyone else is doing it. You see 12 year old kids begging their parents to let them go see Pineapple Express with all their friends, a movie that when watched from an experienced stoner's perspective, is really more of a satire about the pseudo-gayness of most stoners.      Now I've obviously tripped on several substances and smoked a decent amount of bud over the years (I'm in college now), and I don't really do too many drugs anymore aside from getting smoked up on the occasional blunt, but I'm kind of glad I got all that **** out of my system before it had been completely worked through the corporate machine like it's being now. I mean seriously, how long before Hot Topic turns from a mainstream goth clothing store to a mainstream stoner clothing store? 3 years? And when it comes to throwing hallucinogens into the mainstream, Fear and Loathing took the first step with that. How long before everyone is doing mushrooms and acid? It's ridiculous.      I'm starting to see why they make these drugs illegal. It's so only the people who don't care about breaking laws get to use them, because quite frankly, they are the only ones that should be or deserve to.

IM NOT NECESSARILY LOOKING FOR A YES OR NO ANSWER, BUT ANY TYPE OF HELP YOU CAN GIVE ME TO SOLVE MY PROBLEM.      In the end i'll have to resort to a doctor, but till then...

I started working out in September, the first month i gianed 12 lbs (started at 119). Now i've been stuck here at 128 to 133 going up and down since October.

Then at lunch I would have like a foot long subway sandwich (mostly meat), then for dinner I woudl have a salad, lasagna, and potatos and a glass of milk. These are examples of what I eat, i also have protein shakes between those so average at the end of the day I would have eaten 4,000 to 5,000 calories im guessing.

Currently these are my symptoms:      I tend to almost always feel bloated.   I have random bowel movements: Tonight I had to go to the bathroom 5 times. Mostly though, its 2 times a day.    Every time I feel the need to go poop, I feel nauseous. My mouth becomes dry and the best relief is when I go release it, then I start to salivate again and I feel less nauseous. When I feel nauseous, I can't talk or swallow well. Its hard to walk.      I also have a tendency to swallow air when I need to poop and its especially hard to be at school with friends and they keep talking to me but I can't respond in a complete sentence.       Also sometimes I get hungry every 3 hours. And when I get hungry, I really really need to eat. I need to have something in my mouth to trick my stomach that I'm eating. If I don't, I get dry mouth and its hard to talk as well. I feel weak.      Because of this I always carry a pack of sugarless gum with me and a bottle of powerade. I take sips of powerade and chew a stick of gum when I get dry mouth.      what I find most bothersome is that I might feel wonderful one moment, then all of a sudden, I feel nauseous. I might be at at my friends house then someone says a joke. I start to laugh and then all of a sudden I can't laugh anymore because I will gag.

20090221013455AAOsRS9	Health;Mental Health	Need help major depression.. anyone please help NEED TO TALK TO SUMONE ASAP.?	My GF dumped me 6 months back & the problem is that i am still not yet over her. We were going around for 2 months    out of which 1 month was in our home town and the othe was a long distance one as she moved abroad for her Masters.   She dumped me apparently for stupid reasons like, i was younger than her & that she dint like me anymore, she dint have time   for herself and so she could nt give me time etc etc, she even said that one of the reasons for dumping me was that i cried   quite a few times before she left for australia (as i realy love her and i would miss her a lot) they were tears of love. To make things shittier she said painful things like i should find a girl who will reciprocate my love etc etc... even during the realn (long dist)   i used to everyday make international calls to her & she hardly appreciated that, bt i never cared as long as i just   even got to hear her voice. In between she was bak to our country for a family ceremony she had promised she would meet me but she on arriving here she said she could not meet me as she was uncomfortable in meeting me. I again felt like ****. (this was in 3 months bak) i was dumped exactly 6 months bak. recently i mailed her and said that i miss her and she replied saying back that shes with someone else and i cant say such things to her anymore   and that she cant be friends with someone who likes her. She always makes me feel like ****, i mean am i such a bad person that she cud nt evn b frank and open and tell me that she likes someone else, it would have been easier for me. I keep feeling miserable, i took antidepressants i became a chain smoker & a toatl alcoholic, i also started misusing the antidepressants, but    now ive quit smoking and trying to reduce my alcohol my career is also ruined (filmmaker & actor, a former model) its    hell difficult. I feel lost and now my doc has again dumpd me onto a 1 month course of antidepressants, Im fedup i need help   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME    everyday is getting tougher and tougher. Im wasting my life bt shes still in my mids always i keep thinking of her day and night.

Well its vaginal infection, though it doesn't hurts, no itching ( sometimes), no redress, discharge is normal ( not yellow). Then i thought herpes? i looked up webs >< wah so many infections i found... yea scary but not like mine, mine doesn't looks that scary and serious.    For me its important, I'm not going just sit here and do nothing ( no i didn't sleep with anyone, but i did masturbate =x) So i think  cause of that i'm infected, but then again i have no symptoms, means no feeling ( pain, itching, redness or burning.. well itches sometimes but rare) My boyfriend said i can't get infected like that (   we are in distance relationship) Only he knows about  this my problem. I was thinking that after school graduation i  will find job earn $ and go to doctor. But i don't want to wait 5 months or 4  when i graduate. I want  find my answers fast.. so .. yea i'm worried i'm thinking what if it will get serious. It does  sorta looks like herpes but not red, not big, its like  white dots or how i say  more like pimps? nah ;p don't look like pimps and yea not spreading like herpes does, spreads fast if you don't cure and get iy checked by doctor. =/ no idea how do i describe it.  The pictures of infections i saw x-x didn't match my description. I feel sad here though my boyfriend told me not to worry about it,  but i can't just sit and not worry about it and ignore it. I don't want to bother parents, they already done so much for me, so i want them to rest  from worries. ^^ The reason i  asked this, is  because i need  help. maybe  some of you had similar and know what is it.. Maybe its Bacteria? ( though i didn't find answer on Vaginal Bacteria, they all say  it shows symptoms).. I'm worried  what if its really serous infection.  or anything.. Thank you for reading.

20090221023158AAdl0Nr	Health;General Health Care;Other - General Health Care	Why is holding your breath in order to fall asleep a bad idea?	I came up with the idea to do this after watching a show where someone intentionally held their breath in order to lose consciousness and hearing that you yawn in the morning because of lack of oxygen (whether or not it is true is irrelevant).  So whenever I was really tired but couldn't sleep I would hold my breath until I passed out or until I couldn't hold it any longer and then repeated until I passed out because I was getting less oxygen.  My best guess is that the lack of oxygen to your brain can cause irreversible brain damage but is breathing less really that bad a thing?  If you haven't slept in days and couldn't sleep wouldn't this solution be better?   I stopped doing this once I heard it was bad for you but I never really understood why.
