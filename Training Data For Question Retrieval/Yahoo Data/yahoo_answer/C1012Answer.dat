She did a lot for women in the 90s... she can fight her *** off and still look good. She can be a wrestler, a catfight, and a playboy model. She brought back the title when it was "retired." If it wasnt for her, a lot of these "Pretty Divas" wouldnt be here today. She made fighting glam even though supposedly she was rumored to be a ***** backstage. I know I'll get flack for it but you cannot deny the impact Sable had on the WWE for women in the 90s and I hope in about 10 years from now she gets inducted.<br>  <br>  But everyone from the list above SHOULD get inducted before she does.

The 2 teams that know them in and out and play there more often than not is SA and Aus. so they'll probably go down to one of them. Don't think France'll beat them in group stages. <br>  <br>  AB's lose in Semi's or finals (it's more fun that way, for us that is!!!), I have alot of respect for them though, they are a very succesfull team but unless they improve their 1/5 WC record they'll always be a joke!|`|aMW9UDwLaa	Crikeys!!! That's still a fair bit away.  They'd be concentrating more on retaining the Bledisloe and Tri-Nation cups at the moment.  What would Aussie be retaining in the meantime???|`|Rm6mpOelaa	no i reckon with side support it will be sweet as!!!!!!!! WOOHOO!|`|F5JXQUEAaa	Well theyre in the same pool as France, so they'll lose that one obviously. Then they will face either England or Argentina in the quarter finals, so I'd say England. Doesn't matter, the Boks or Australia going to win anyways.|`|2hjMFEUyaa	I really don't hope they choke in the quarter's or semi's - I would like to see them make the final and then lose to SA. To be the best you have to beat the best, SA didn't even play NZ in 2007 WC the victory therefor seemed a little empty.........

You can't run in front of the ball, you can't throw the ball forward.<br>  <br>  There is no limit as to how many times you get tackled before having to kick the ball away.<br>  <br>  There is only 1 team, not 2 (offencive & defencive)<br>  <br>  this would take a long time to explain to you. Check it out on wiki|`|YDXITLv1aa	sevens is a little bit different from normal rugby.<br>  <br>  sevens is basically used to help train up future rugby players.<br>  <br>  in rugby there are 15 players. you cant throw the ball forward like you do in america football. however, it is constant non-stop gameplay. the aim of the game is to score the most points. <br>  <br>  a "try"(similar to a touch down) is worth 5 points. <br>  <br>  when you score a "try" you have a chance to "convert" it. i.e. kick the ball through the posts. a "conversion" is worth 2 points. <br>  <br>  if a penalty is given (due to foul play) u may kick the ball from that spot. if it goes through the posts.. then it is worth 3 points.<br>  <br>  most players should be able to do all of the following tasks.. attack, defend, kick, sidestep, fend, ruck etc. etc.<br>  <br>  just like in american football, size helps. backs usually average about 6ft. forwards usually average about 6ft 4. locks average 6ft 8. most players range from 220 - 280 pounds.<br>  <br>  the game lasts for 80 minutes.|`|SHiESc4zaa	its like american football but you can only tackle the person with the ball.|`|0xfVyxxIaa	Sevens isn't a very good display of Rugby. It has almost no forward play.|`|YFx8N0wjaa	i can't|`|Xcs1USwvaa	Rugby football (usually just "rugby") may refer to a number of sports through history descended from a common form of football developed in different areas of England. Rugby league and rugby union are the only two sports referred to as "rugby" today, although Australian rules football, American football and Canadian football are modern sports that have originated from Rugby football.|`|aYVPZjLVaa	watch rugby 101 on youtube. As someone else said it would take forever to explain. <br>  <br>  Basic rules: <br>  15 people a side. You can only tackle the person with the ball. no blocking. anyone may kick the ball at anytime. If the ball goes out of bounds the other team throws it in (a lineout). A try is like a touchdown and is worth 5 points the conversion kick is worth two. A dropkick (ball must be kicked after being dropped from the hand and touching the ground) in game or penalty (place kick) is worth 3. Play does not stop after a tackle players contest the ball. A tackle is when the ball carrier is brought down and held. If the ball carrier is not held he may get up and continue running. Their are only 7 subs allowed everyone plays both offense and defense. Blood subs occur when a player is bleeding and therefore must leave the field, they may return if they do so within ten minutes. Any other player subbed off the field stays off for the duration of the game (except when a front row is needed for safety reasons). Two halves 40 minutes each (no timeouts). Play only stops for severe injuries (someone is either clearly unconcious, screaming badly, or has a possible neck or spine injury), out of bounds (very short), and after a try (kick must be taken within a minute and play after that must be restarted promptly). The field is 100m by 70m max (larger than a football field) try zones are 10-22m long. The ball must be touched to the ground in the try zone to score a try. and it goes on.<br>  <br>  Sevens is a bit different. The above is for 15s (union) which is much more prevalent. 7's has only 7-10 minute halves with a minute for halftime. and there are only 7 players on the field (hence the name). The main rules don't change. Most changes revolve around the fact that there are fewer players.<br>  <br>  League is way different but not played extensively in the US (while union 15-a-side is).|`|M84v7ZqSaa	This site might best answer your questions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.renegades-rugby.org/basicrugby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.renegades-rugby.org/basicrugb...</a>

RJ5Bevmpaa	I checked the answers and not many seemed to be very big on the history of fighting in this league.<br>  <br>  As far as bench clearers, the true heavy weight champs in that one would have to be the Vendredi Saint (Good Friday) game between Montreal and Quebec in the playoffs. There was a bench clearer to end the second and somehow they allowed players that had been ejected from the game onto the ice before the 3rd and they had the second brawl of the intermission when tempers flared over a cheap shot by Slegr on Hamel in the first brawl.<br>  <br>  The Canada Russia jr brawl (punch up in Piestany) from 1987 would be another of the all time classics of course.<br>  <br>  Any of the other bench clearers just don't seem to carry the same magic as those two.<br>  <br>  If you want amusing fights, one of the most amusing I have ever seen was Jim Korn and Wally Weir fighting in the penalty box, although Chara vs McCabe's ragdoll act and Semin's drum solo on Staal were both amusing as well<br>  <br>  For toe to toe fights worth watching, I'd suggest a series made by a guy that went by the Knuckles Nilan alias called bitter rivals. You'll find a series of brawls between Probert and Domi in there as well as some all time classics between John Kordic and Jay Miller that are a must see for any fight fan.<br>  <br>  Among current heavyweights, the most entertaining fights I've seen have to be from Derek Boogaard as he isn't very much for finese so he tend to take some shots and then drops some very heavy bombs on his poor victim if he can survive the first few shots. Look up Boogaard's knockouts compilation on youtube as well. Between the lot of those, it should keep you entertained for awhile.|`|lYnkvRASaa	the Good Friday Habs Nordiques brawl was pretty good.

Fp40wHSraa	Hello again Tyler,<br>      The first cue you listed (Players JB-6) is a Jump Break Cue.  This is used only for those two things, jumping and breaking.  It is not suited for use as a playing cue.  The second choice is the Adam.  Not bad for the money.  Of the cues you listed I would recommend using the McDemott.  If you are set on buying a cue new this one is the best for the money.  Personally I would take McDermott over any Viking cue.  I would also suggest you seriously consider Ebay.  The link below is for Nielson Billiards store on Ebay.  They offer cues at sometimes up to 60% off the retail price.  Check them out.  GREAT prices on Lucasi Cues.  I seriously think you should consider either Lucasi or McDermott.  Also, browse some of the auctions on used cues.  You'd be suprised what you can get in the $80 to $120 price range.  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Nielsens-Billiards_Lucasi-Vintage-Lightning-Cue_W0QQcolZ2QQdirZ1QQfsubZ3QQftidZ2QQtZkm" rel="nofollow">http://stores.ebay.com/Nielsens-Billiard...</a>|`|UHCopNpgaa	kinda hard to say every player had his own preference me i play with a poison AX4 & break with a poison VX2 both made by predator i also have a predator BK2 break stick,& a cuetec i bought all 4 of them from www.billiardswarehouse.com took me a while to find a stick i really liked but now im stuck on poison cues.|`|Vp3Lxg4taa	I like McDermott, but Viking is also very good as well.  My friend has a Falcon, which hits really good.  McDermott, Falcon, Viking, Joss, etc are all very good cues.  It comes down to preference once you get in that category.  If you like to keep your que in the trunk of your car, where the temperature and moisture can get to it, Cuetec is a good choice because the shaft is MORE resistant to warp. <br>  <br>  For me, I have Cuetec for my trunk, and a Meucci that I will bring for tournaments or scheduled practice.  I like the Falcon better than the Meucci, but again, it really is preference more than anything when you are talking about GOOD ques.

439bb8e9dd46532d20f20e3ec0b9fa18aa	Q-school is always an option.  Winning an amateur event can get you qualified for the US Open.  Playing well in the Open can get some doors open for you.  Getting a sponsors exemption, then placing well can get you started down the earnings trail, which is how Tiger made it to the pros.<br>  <br>  I strongly suggest going to school and getting a degree.

Next year's draft is chock full of wide receiver talent, which is the Jets biggest need, and I'm confident that within a year or so the FO will put enough guys around Sanchez to make him succeed.<br>  <br>  Let's not forget that the Jets have a great offensive line and a veritable stable of running backs.

eFQXl7uyaa	You will hear "best ever" when he is the "best ever" - he is a player that plays for the right reason, he loves the game. That kind of hype comes from agents and managers who want more money. At the end of his career he will be compared with people like Tony Gwynn and Rod Carew where you just look back and think - Man, he was good.<br>  What most people don't understand is that AP is not a power hitter, he just has power. His approach is very Charlie Lau - less movement and more core power (see George Brett, Gwynn, Carew) and we are starting to see other players trying to copy Albert - A-Rod started 2 years ago.. Pujols only struck out 54 times last year, he puts the bat on the ball. The rest will take care of itself.|`|syzMIfLLaa	How about 2001, just kidding, but I've wondered since then.

8bTder08aa	Alex, to be a successful jockey, one of the things you need is a good agent.  Jockeys get most of their mounts through the work of their agent drumming up business for them.  You will have trouble getting any agent at all to handle your book if you are not completely committed to riding races as a full-time occupation.  Because the agent's earnings are based on the earnings of the rider or riders he books for, an agent is going to want to work with the rider who can make him the most money.  And a part-time jockey just isn't going to get the kind of rides a full-time rider will have.<br>  <br>  When a trainer has a "live" horse, a horse with a good chance to win, entered in a race, he wants the rider he puts up on that horse to be the most fully committed, single-minded and skilled rider he can get.  Nobody is going to want to put a rider up whose mindset is "well, if I don't win this, I've still got my jumpers going for me."  Or who is going to ride cautiously because if she does something risky and gets hurt, she'll miss out on a major jumper competition.  (I would pay admission to see an agent approach someone like Bob Baffert and tell him "You should put Alex up on your good horse!  I know she's not committed to race-riding full time, but she's doing awfully well on the Grand Prix jumper circuit!")<br>  <br>  If you wanted to ride jumpers competitively and work racehorses as an exercise rider, that would be something you could shoot for.  But if you want to ride racehorses in races, unless you commit to it full time, I don't see you having any chance of succeeding.  I doubt if you'd be able to get an agent to handle your book for you.|`|0kItAwMcaa	You probably couldn't have both as it would probably be too much for you. you could be a steeplechaser though which is when you gallop over jumps.|`|vrwop4Eiaa	YES 4 SURE BUT A JOCKEY BE BETTER|`|8lsBBK62aa	There will probably come a time when you'll have to choose one over the other. <br>  There are plenty of links between the showjumping world and the horse racing world though. Harvey Smith is now training racehorses having been a world famous show jumper and Con Power (whose son rode a Grand National winner) became a trainer after representing Ireland in the show jumping arena.<br>  Lots of jump jockeys such as Paul Carberry and Tony McCoy started off riding at gymkhanas.
hCaotAlCaa	The Nats are going to be tough and much improved but they will once again have the bad luck to be stuck in the toughest, or at worst second toughest division in baseball.  They played a lot better than their record last year but they will have to fight to finish fourth.  I figure the Braves will see them all from below, and the Phillies will take it.  The Mets and Marlins will be fighting for second.  <br>  <br>  The Mets, as usual, will lead the league in mindless, juvenile dugout antics.|`|lQXF63Rpaa	Larry Sinclair is Barack Obama's gay accuser.

AA10270018	This is an even match up but I give a slight edge to Paul Williams because he is in his prime and Winky is at the end of his career.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	I gotta say williams. wink has great defense, but i do think his age and  his lack of offense will go against him with a guy that is as active as williams. wink has a bad habit of giving away rounds by being to defensive and not offensive enough.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	This would be a damn good fight, I think Wink is at the point in his career where he needs a victory over a name opponent, and Wright would put forth an extra effort to get inside Williams reach and be more aggressive.  Williams will bring a lot of action, bunches of punches and if this fight ever happens it would be a good one.<br>  <br>  I like Williams, Wink is getting a little long in the tooth, and was never know as a KO puncher.  The activity level of Williams should be enough to carry the decision unless Wink can nail the welter weight with a bomb, it would be a long night for the older defensive specialist.  <br>  <br>  Paul Williams by decision.|`|Yrcf7HGAaa	Wright has given trouble to many fighters throughout his career the only problem is that many boxing fans don't like to see a defensive boxer, boxing fans want to see a KO artist.<br>  <br>  Williams has not only the age advantage but also has the height, reach and power to beat Wright by decision come April 4th.<br>  <br>  This fight should be interesting!
bGWcSAGCaa	Take it back.<br>  <br>  All products are required to function as would be expected by a reasonable user.  That's the jist of the law that applies to all mfrs and retailers for new products sold in the US.  It's only reasonable that a bicycle should have safe, reliable, effective brakes.  Yours doesn't.  It's defective.  Even if you were outside the return period, but within the warranty period, you are still entitled to return the defective product.  Since it can't be resold as is, your not having the original packaging is not an excuse for the store to deny the valid return.<br>  <br>  If you don't have the sales receipt, save your 3hrs and your gas.

DO buy a bike from a reputable dealer in your area as they sell a higher quality of bike in all aspects and with your safety in mind too.

4d7b908cfe24bf3f1177a5cca13feb22aa	There are 2 types of stamina.  Aerobic and anaerobic.  Aerobic has to do with long stamina in which all of the oxygen used by your body's muscle comes from the air you breath.  When you exert beyond your aerobic capacity, you draw energy from your muscles.  Once the oxygen is depleted from your muscles, you're out of gas.  That's anaerobic.  You need to maximize BOTH if you want to be a boxer.  You've got to be able to go the distance, and you've got to be able to throw punches in bunches, and be able to quickly recover the anaerobic energy between rounds.  On even days, go for distance, run for an hour or two.  On odd days, practice sprinting.  Run for 3 minutes, making sure you gas yourself, then rest for a minute, and repeat the process.<br>  <br>  By the way, shouldn't you have a trainer helping you with this???|`|R0J1W3BCaa	I used to have problems getting into decent condition until I read this book. Its good for helping Boxers get into better shape its going to explain every thing you need and it also comes with a DVD the easiest thing to do is order it but IF you don't read it its only going to hurt you man.

AND GET A DECENT WORKOUT IN THE GYM. BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO WORK HARD JUST QUIT BEFORE YOU GET HURT.|`|HuSlCMC6aa	Taslk to your trainer.

RqQDKEVHaa	You say you "already got it almost planned out." Well, then, it sounds as if you've created it.<br>  <br>  Your own fighting style most likely would be a blend of other styles, adapted to your skills, abilities, or the situations in which the style would be used. You need enough knowledge in other fighting styles to be able to pick and choose what you consider to be most effective.|`|nRBC4E5saa	You ask for help and then say "no criticizing allowed" (that's how it's really spelled, by the way).  So basically you're a teenager, if that, who's asking for nothing but validation.  Too bad.<br>  <br>  There are already over 1000 martial arts in existence.  Probably far more than that.  How many of them have you studied?<br>  <br>  The odds of you creating something "unique" are astronomical.  Just about every good technique and principle has already been used.  Lots and lots and lots of times.  In fact most martial arts already in existence already have a lot more in common than they have different.  If you happen to come up with something that nobody has seen before, chances are that it will violate the principles of combat, and will suck.<br>  <br>  You want suggestions, tips, and so on?  Alright.  Go out and study existing martial arts.  Study them for years.  Get a black belt/instructor certificate in a couple of them.  Try to understand the underlying principles of how they work.  What do they have in common, what's different?  Then after studying martial arts for 30 years or so, maybe you can come up with something unique.  But probably not.  Chances are that the best you can do is take principles and techniques of existing martial arts and format them into your own syllabus.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	study one martial art style for about 40 to 50 yrs, 8 hrs per day, under some of the best instructors you can find, and cross train in several other styles. having at least a 3rd or 4th degree in the other minor styles. in your main style you should be at least a 7th degree preferable an 8th degree. by that point if you have trained hard and are good you should begin to understand what it takes to create your own style|`|3DnX9NmAaa	I agree with Shihan J. You need a lot of training before you'll have enough knowledge to create your own style. If you have, then you determine what your martial art is going to be about, what techniques and principles it will teach. Then you name it. Then you open up a school and teach it.|`|Y26eOD9Caa	Quite simply, put your favorite moves together, and there you have it.|`|AA12388139	A 'fighting style' is not a Martial art. Every competent fighter has their own preferred personal style. Fighters are not regimented soldiers, they are individuals.  Often the style is greatly influenced by the body structure of the fighter, eg generally if tall and skinny the style leans to karate; if strong and short then more to wrestling and Ju Jutsu; if light and flexible then to a 'Soft' style.  You need techniques that deal with the various distances of fighting, that is, mainly those of striking distance, grabbing distance and rumbling or ground work distance.  All styles have strengths and weaknesses, make sure that you know yours.  Get comment from other senior artists, we all have the same aim, to grow and flower from out of the struggle (****) of life.  Better the impact of verbal criticisms on your mind than a rude awaking by the impact of a fist on your head.  Work out whether the style must meet the differing needs of a sport competitive arena or that of a combative area such as the street.  Only to meet one opponent or to sometimes meet many killers?  Unarmed and armed against weapons?  How best to teach it to your students and is it a full art? Does it cover the mental aspect of battle as well as the physical?  For the laying out your art in a structured way and to cover all aspects, it is helpful if you can write an instruction manual on your art. Get it copyrighted.  .  If you mean to compose a full art, Good luck.  What you are attempting is a lot of work and few have the skill or the experience, not to mention the creativity (which I just did mention).|`|TnTXGNyMaa	well i suggest you are good at alot of different styles, train in grappling, like jiu jitsu wrestelilng judo etc.. train in striking like muay thai, boxing, kickboxing, karate, then when you are familiar with alot of styles and have something useful out of all these... start your own. you can always start something with knowing nothing about any fighting style...but people will need credibility|`|AA11101806	I agree with Shihan J.<br>  <br>  Also, do some research on how the different styles of karate and different Korean martial arts developed.  Study the transformations, who trained who (lineages of the Masters), and what caused some changes to take place.<br>  <br>  you can see how people influenced each other, and how styles were effected by wars, invasions, etc.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	YOU JUST HAVE TO STUDY MANY DIFFERENT MARTIAL ARTS TAKE WHAT IS USEFUL TO YOU AND ADD IT TO YOUR ARSENAL.

tH6z3JKWaa	Wow, I am surprised. I had always assumed you were a male. Probably because your public persona is an image of Brett Lee, just goes to show you never know who one is communicating with over the internet. <br>  But, re your Q I would be extremely pissed with Delmege and his board room puppets if I was a Manly supporter. Before all this nonsense broke I honestly thought that Manly were a big chance of back to back premierships, I now think that if the boardroom dramas aren't resolved in an enlightened way and instead they drag on and escalate that they are no chance. In fact if the crisis escalates and drags on it's possible ( although unlikely ) that Manly might miss the final 8 altogether.<br>  Re. your 3 specific points - Des Hasler & KPI's - If it wasn't so stupidly bizare, it would be laughable. For God's sake let the coach, coach. If he does a good/great job ( which Hassler has ) leave him do as he sees fit. If not sack him and replace him. Is this the downside of letting corporate types run a footy club ?<br>  Grant Mayer - Also crazy, like Hassler he also has done a great job, you would think that they would be doing everything in their power to keep him rather than making it clear that they don't want him.<br>  Peter Peters - When taken with the other 2 decisions I get the impression that this all about Max Delmege & his ego. I gather that Max has the controlling share in the ownership of the club, if that's the case then unless Max is willing to put his ego aside and see reason then I don't think the fans have any say or influence. Bottom line is you may be force to lump it or find yourself another club to support.<br>  I guess this is the downside of clubs being privately owned, contrasts markedly with my fav. club ( Broncos ), but I think that in the case of the Broncos no individual has a controlling share in the ownership.<br>  I honestly feel sorry for the average loyal Manly supporter, seems like your club has sold from under you.|`|H8ts9BHmaa	I THINK YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT TO MUCH , IF YOU INVESTED AS MUCH TIME INTO GETTING A CHICK  THAN YOU DO THINKING ABOUT A SHITTY GAME  THEN YOUR THOUGHTS MIGHT BE MORE IN TUNE WITH THE REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUES OF TODAY'S WORLD(LIKE CHICKS).|`|CZvrFqZ1aa	I hate reading all this crap, all I care about at the end is that the team ends up playing and playing well.<br>  It's more of a 'she said, he said' kind of ordeal, I don't know who the hell to believe and it's really pissing me off, talk of relocation to CC and all the other things... I'm just gonna look at how we're playing and that only.<br>  I hope it goes well, and the positive thing happens (whatever that may be) so we can focus on just how great we are on the field and not the dilemmas going off the field.

To give you some idea about the difference and what fighters use in sparring in the gym they usually use a 16, 18, or even a 20 ounce glove to keep the training injuries down and even with them you can knock someone out if you have a good punch.  MMA gloves carry about 5-6 ounces of padding which is about half of what a fight glove is in boxing so you can definitely rock people with them and knock them out.|`|40Ow9B1maa	ufc gloves would od more damage bc the knuckels and fingers are out of the glove so you will have a harder inpack rather then boxing gloves which cover the entire hand|`|mpBC86Auaa	The better punchers are usually wearing the boxing glove, but the UFC glove has the potential to be more devastating.|`|dB85SoMyaa	It is not the gloves, it is the puncher!|`|3267581d4fe0c877a2fee89c9c9a0c43aa	Boxing gloves are heavier, but the area of impact is greater.  Obviously you know little about either sport if you think the gloves are gonna earn you the KO.  It's about where you strike and how well your opponent is able deflect the impact.  The best strike zone is the jawline, but it's usually the best protected too.  Happy head-hunting|`|6QyQQnWmaa	Proven fact: Ufc 4 oz gloves will do more damage such as black eyes, and cutting you open. Heavier (12-16 oz) boxing gloves are heavily padded and arnt as easy to cut someone open, but more likely to cause a concussion, brain damage and trauma because of the extra weight it carries. That is why more people die in Boxing and toughman than in mma|`|j3OwcG6Maa	If the same fighter threw the same exact punch at the same exact velocity, etc. the mma (4-6oz) glove will hit harder. The boxing glove's size allows for the impact to spread on the point of impact.|`|CdAE4nXcaa	UFC GLOVES BY FAR, THEY ARE MUCH SMALLER, AND MUCH LIGHTER. THE UFC GLOVES ARE MEANT TO BASICALLY PROTECT THE FIGHTERS KNUCKLES, THE THE PERSON HE'S PUNCHING. BEING MUCH SMALLER IT GENERATES MORE POWER TO A CONCENTRATED AREA.|`|E563RzW2aa	Obviously the UFC glove.  You don't even need to get technical about force transfer or concentration.  UFC gloves are visibly thinner than boxing gloves.  There is some cushioning on the glove, but not as much as a boxing glove.|`|Myj4RBU6aa	first of all Lindzya if you have know clue why would you reply..... and a ufc glove is abit thicker around the knuckle area so a puch right to the cheek would hurt more than a boxers glove so . im goin with ufc|`|TnTXGNyMaa	the ufc glove|`|4eBa1UBAaa	i have no clue srry|`|xc47S574aa	This is a very easy question the ufc gloves are 4-6 onces lighter than boxing gloves 16 ozs. The heavier the glove, the more protection it offers.|`|GCufUbxJaa	the UFC gloves(4 oz.) would do more damage than a boxing glove(11oz.) they have less padding.|`|jTLIf7udaa	UFC gloves would do more damage than boxing gloves.
NZKramllaa	No, WWE just has very little Competition for all their Championships.<br>  <br>  BQ: Divas Belt isn't Really Necessary and It seems WWE doesn't care about the WWE tag Championship, So that could go also.|`|smcDn76jaa	How can you feel that if some of these titles don't even get paid attention to. The titles I would cut is the Divas title and the WWE Tag Team Championship. It's like they don't even exist, and Miz and Morrison already got to each brand so another tag title is pointless.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Sometimes I Do Think So. The WWE Tag Titles Are Pointless And Are Being Misused, And The WWE Divas Title Was Just A Waste Of Time.

All the titles are pretty much the same thing like the WHC and WWE Championship are pretty much the same thing, they just need to have one in S! and Raw (But not right now.) <br>  <br>  BQ: If i had to i would probably get rid of the Divas Championship and the U.S. Championship. Theres never really anyone fighting for them.|`|3G87TjYtaa	Well yes and no.  WWE is only the promotion company, the sub companies would be ECW, RAW and Smackdown.  This was brought on as a controlled competition when WWE purchased it's competitors WCW, AWA and ECW.   <br>  <br>  I would get rid of Smackdown  and ECW championships.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	No.<br>  It's Fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  But Seriously - Lose the Diva's Title & MAYBE One of the Tag Titles (WWE).<br>  And - Bring Back the Cruiserweight Championship.|`|b7JS16dyaa	They should just have one Tag title and one Women's title, where anyone from any brand could challenge for it. This is because there aren't enough teams/Divas these days to have two credible championships.|`|oFV48JbGaa	Kill the Diva's championship.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously...|`|jkIaDNTvaa	I think Underbaker will be new undisputed champion.|`|NuavkWfIaa	no. makes matches interesting when something is on the line|`|071c54599417711d6da1a29dbbf40d97aa	Sure, I’ve bought about six from the WWE merchandise store & now I’m feeling that people don't take me seriously, when I wear them at work. Sometimes people laugh at me on the bus if I’m wearing two at the same time.|`|fX5s1T1xaa	No there are enough titles...If you want to see a lot of championship belts watch boxing.<br>  Toss the WWE Championship and just have the World Championship|`|8nGSw1caaa	the word tag team<br>  the ecw world title <br>  world heavyweight title|`|UX2RF1aDaa	still want the hardcore champ back|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	If they where all given the right attention no they would all add something to the show but the WWE doesn't give a crap about them so why have them? I'd keep them all but i would give them the proper attention and story's so they mean something.|`|AA11482019	I would merge the WWE & WHC titles into the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the WWE tag titles with the World tag titles into the WWE World Tag Tag Championship, and the Women's and Diva's tiles as well.

5cvKJNXLaa	No i didnt, think that<br>  I felt Brock Lesnar would be the future of heels|`|oFV48JbGaa	I never thought Edge would even turn heel lol.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I never knew he could be such an awesome heel, I figured he would be a decent face.<br>  <br>  BQ: Honestly, I thought all the new talent was pretty bleak at the time.
KNTofuxMaa	It depends on too many things to speculate at this time. He is going to have to dispel the sentiment that he is merely a college player at this point. That means taking some snaps under center and not relying on the spread so much. I think Tebow is a great college player but have yet to see too much promise for the pro level.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	I'm guessing Tampa Bay.|`|f5e243b3090fd85449d1a91b415bf5d8aa	No the lions wouldn't be dumb enough to pick him up. They are guaranteed to improve next year just because of their weak schedule , so they won;t have as high a draft pick anyway. Beside Tebow's going to be another Joey Harrington. He won't last three years.|`|0BgzkLdUaa	He's not even in the draft this year... So OBVIOUSLY we have to wait until next season to see which teams play so awfully that they get an early draft pick and which teams are looking for a QB/FB kind of player.|`|DMnFAL8Faa	Time will tell, there are a lot of factors to look at before anyone can make a guess, let's see how things progress for him with college football first.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	No worry.... I heard the Lions were going to draft another WR for 3 more years|`|qOxyflwiaa	Tebow won't go to Detroit because I think the Lions still don't know what they're doing.  I'd expect him to go to Cleveland since the guy the Browns drafted to be their franchise QB, Brady Quinn, is still a backup, and nobody's sure when Brady's going to start(least of all the new Browns coaching staff and front office).  Plus, Derek Anderson, like Brady, is coming off an injury.  If Derek is still hobbled in '09 I look for the Browns to make a serious run at Tebow.|`|U3KAgO0baa	It doesn't really matter Tim Tebow isn't a NFL quality QB.<br>  If he wants to be a good NFL player he needs 2 learn how 2 catch and move 2 TE (ei: Pat White this year, who was a GREAT College QB and will now play WR in the NFL)<br>  Tebow will be either a 3rd or 4th rounder at TE.<br>  <br>  Others Who have made the move from QB 2 another skill position in the NFL.<br>  <br>  Michael Robinson (Penn St.)- Now a RB in San Fransisco<br>  Brad Smith (Mizzou)- Now a WR for the Jets<br>  Antwan Randle El (Indiana)- WR in Washington|`|0Ub8hoN6aa	maybe the lions will go on a QB binge kinda like they did with WR's a few years ago... stafford, tebow... <br>  <br>  um i dont know if your assuming he will be a top pick then not to be descriminatory but some teams that don't look very good are<br>  <br>  <br>  cardinals-(i know they had a big run but everyone besides fitz and warner are jumpin ship.)-and boldin wants to but i think he is stuck there<br>  browns- i had high hopes for them this year but... wtf happened...<br>  seahawks<br>  lions<br>  bucs<br>  <br>  personally i don't think he'll be a top pick maybe 3rd or 4th round but you never know...|`|0jHCveFaaa	doesn't matter....he'll be a wildcat quarterback at best, there's even talk or transforming him into either a tight end or half back, neither of which he'll be too successful at, so it looks like he made the right decision to finish out college and get his degree|`|ftP6mhuvaa	2nd or 3rd Round depending on how he does with his arm he won't be a 1st round pick.<br>  <br>  Hmm...<br>  Vikings? Shape him to be another Daunte Culpepper but Tebow has a nice attitude.|`|PC60YeBIaa	yeah, it's true, the Lions|`|Sm7Oev8Iaa	It would be in the best interest for the Lions to sign him.|`|63PdLNMQaa	more like...what bench he'll be sitting in all game

3tSMTwGraa	Good age to start. I take TKD myself and it cost 60 dollars a month here in Houston. I don't know how much where you live?|`|8q82dLS8aa	anger and hate is the path to the darkside!!!! >_<|`|ab5ee73c4a40583a54daa8bd7423eeefaa	The price varies from school to school. Some charge weekly, monthly, or for a standard (6) month agreement. Many schools make you pay for belt test, require tournaments to get the next rank, charge for private lessons, and may only allow you to train on certain days of the week at a specific time. But as a general thing I've heard anything from $50-$180 a month. Where I train it's $169. It's important to ask these questions and call around to local places you are considering. Also before you sign up actually go in and watch, ask if you can try it out to see if you like it before you pay anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck I hope this helped.|`|4f2GaLhpaa	Well my Tae Kwon Do school costs $80 per month with a year contract and you go two times a week, but you can also get 6 months for $500. I'm pretty sure thats the average around here, but it depends on where you live.|`|GiONso7zaa	Karate and tae kwon do are virtually identical. <br>  <br>  You should probably learn to channel your anger elsewhere.<br>  <br>  The last thing you need is to teach taekwondo to somebody that takes their anger out by fighting.|`|3XACILp8aa	why taekwondo?|`|V9ucqn5caa	It varies greatly. The place I currently go to is about $50 a month, my old school was about $100 a month, and there is another place that has classes varying from $150-300 a month. <br>  That last place is the exception, however. My guess is somewhere between $50 and $150.|`|j3OwcG6Maa	It depends on the gym and how often you want to train. For a few times a week expect to pay around $100.|`|gm9xPIW8aa	Aw man karate or MMA is way better than taekwondo
D2CC2t0kaa	yes without a doubt. In that series vs. the Pistons in 05 (the most heartbroken ive been ever) Nobody on the Heat was healthy. Everyone on the entire team was injured in some way besides Damon Jones and he rolled an ankle in Game 7. If Wade and Shaq were healthy, the Heat wouldve slaughtered the Pistons like in 06. We barley lost with a bunch of injured player. But if we did win a 'chip in 05, we may of not won it in 06 b/c Riles wouldnt of have traded for Antione and Jwill and Posey. So you never can tell. You cant change the past|`|aUGM3ju6aa	He yeah they would. Wade would of showed Lebron how to beat those Spurs...Ha Ha!|`|EKF2HdZKaa	in 2005?<br>  i do think that the heat wouldve contended harder,im not sure if they wouldve won it all because it was wade and shaqs first year together,plus i think it was the spurs they had to face in the finals and the heat team would not have beat them<br>  honestly no one knows|`|piZ4xDBqaa	Nope.  Miami might have made the finals, but they would have lost to the Spurs.  Detroit was a much harder matchup for the Spurs in terms of personnel.|`|ZWkX43zMaa	What if, what if, what if.<br>  <br>  What if they never got Shaq in the first place, or drafted D-Wade. Would they have won a championship at all?|`|c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	no one will ever know|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Yea, Heat were up 3-2 in the series when D-Wade went down with an injury.

Mossberg's shotgun has gone through the military torture test of firing 3,000 hi-power buckshot without cleaning. The only one to ever pass. Remington has never even entered.|`|3Twg9Uuuaa	Seeing as how the 870 was around first I would say Mossberg is trying to compete against Remington|`|3e8e34aadabc9c4673b05bc7f3e997a0aa	Seeing how the 870 design was around for for decades before the 500 was, I think any such comparison would be futile.|`|TvARYVRJaa	apples to oranges  ok|`|AA11570394	This may help you;<br>  <a href="http://www.tacticalshotgun.ca/content_nonsub/shotguns/compare_870_590.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tacticalshotgun.ca/content_no...</a><br>  <br>  Quote; “Mossberg 500s and 590s are typically marketed as the "one pump action shotgun...heavy duty enough to pass...Mil-Spec 3443E, a brutal and unforgiving torture test with 3,000 rounds of full power 12 gauge buckshot". Referring to the US Armed Services shotgun selection trials that eventually lead to the adaptation of the Mossberg 590A1 by the armed forces in 1987, from what we here at tacticalworks.ca remember this claim is misleading to say the least. It is true that the Mossberg was the only shotgun to pass the endurance trials, but what they neglect to tell you is that Remington didn't even bother to enter a gun into the trials.”<br>  <br>  The 870 is used by law enforcement and the military today.<br>   <br>   I could not find “proof”, however I do remember that Remington had already sold their shotguns to the military before 1987 (wow I though I was a old man then!

Mine has jammed a grand total of one time and I have well over 1,000 rounds through it, mostly the cheap target shells too.<br>  <br>  Go with the mossberg
bS5wpKvOaa	Go back down to 9 miles.  Chances are, I think, that when you run 12 miles you probably do it slowly.  Work on increasing your speed for 9 miles.  The faster you can do it, without getting more tired is an increase in endurance, and that is necessary for any kind running.<br>  <br>  Though 9 miles miht be pushing it to.  6 miles is fairly average for a runner, so that is the best option.  Run that about 3-5 times a week, each time trying to maintain a faster speed without getting more tired than the last.<br>  <br>  <br>  This is purely an opinion from me, about how to do.  I am not an expert but I do like long distance running, up to a point.  And Short distance running as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS, <br>  I don't really know any proper ways.  I just work what I find is the best for myself.  This could apply to you.  I would try it, and work around with it until you find a way to do it.

Since the Cards have too many OFs as it is, signing Manny would make no sense.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yes, of course.  He's a great hitter and would be a huge bat to have in the middle of a lineup.  There are his "Manny being Manny" times, but hey, if he's going to sign with a team, one would think he wants to be there, and as a result, will act like a good teammate.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	On a one year contract, sure.  No way would I want my team to sign him to a longer term because he's too unstable a personality.  If he's happy, all is fine.  If he's unhappy he becomes a cancer, shoving old men to the ground and quitting on his team mates.  <br>  <br>  Short term = acceptable risk.  <br>  Long term = disaster waiting to happen.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	I don't think he would fit with the white sox or the diamondbacks.

He's amazing, sure he may play when he wants, he may not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but what he does do well is the most important thing in baseball, and that is WIN!!!!!! The most feared hitter in baseball is not Arod. not Ryan Howard, not Pujols, not Popy, not Tex, not Morneu, not Hamilton, but it's Manny Ramirez. There not a player in baseball, not even the beloved Derek Jeter that i'd prefer to have up at the plate in a big time crucial clutch situation. When the Money is on the line, no pitcher in baseball is getting Manny Ramirez out. Manny could play on my team any day of the week, Hey Manny you want to play third base???? Arod take the bench my man Manny wants to play third. Hey Manny you want to play first Base??? Tex, im sorry but you gonna have to go grab Manny a first base mit out the dug out. But all jokes aside i would love to have Manny as a dh on my team , and i wouldn't mind him playing left neither because he'll make up for his defensive woes with the stick. I've seen Manny single Handel beat the Yankee to many times over the years to not have repsect for him. And the fact of the matter is, he made David Ortiz. David Ortiz went from a bench player in Minnesota, to one of the top 5 hitters in baseball when he had Manny Ramirez behind him as protection.|`|57f9c55e2a8a8bc836e4e19a1e829165aa	YES!!! Did you see what he did with the Dodgers last year? He had 17 homers and batted .396 in 53 games. He tore up the NL last year. Did you see his homer against the Cubs in the playoffs when he was like bent over and hit the low and away ball. He crushed it too. He's a great player and I would love him on the Cubs. Ramirez in Left, Soriano in Center and Bradley in Right..That'd be amazing.|`|qAJWFJlqaa	hes like T.O. hes poison to a team. he showboats, plays when he feels like it and brings a lot of unwanted attention to himself and always keeps his name in the media for reasons that most players dont want to be know for. so in all, no. i would never want him on my team.|`|s1M6IuMxaa	Yea, pay the damn guy LA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gAftPN59aa	no he cant decide what team he wants to be on|`|dgXs1Y2faa	No. He is a drama queen.|`|cK6x9FBBaa	no.

If u suck at tackling ask ur coach wat a power clean is, then do that, its a good lift to get ur muscles in vital areas stronger, and it shows u how 2 get under ur own weight(which is important).  U shouldnt tackle with either shoulder, square up on that sorry *** RB, get low, put ur face mask in his chest, and wrap him up so good he cant go anywhere.   u also need good footwork for coverage, set up 4 cones in a square, and sprint forward, left shuffle, back peddle, right shuffle, repeat.

Wright as much as boxing fans may wonder about his power, Ronald does have the power to hurt anybody he just rather take his time and counter attack when needed.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	I've answered this in more detail before, but what I think it comes down to is that Wright has been inactive too long and will be carrying too much weight to deal with Williams activity level - he'll use superior technique early to keep him in it, but he'll overextend and start to gas out in the middle rounds.<br>  <br>  This is a horrible matchup for Winky at this point in his career.

Juan Diaz is over-rated, all Diaz has is his pressure and somewhat power. <br>  <br>  J.M.Marquez does not only carry the power to knockout his opponents out, "Dinamita" also is a technical fighter who can box very well which is why he has given so much trouble to many elite fighters including pound for pound king Manny Pacquiao in both of their fights!  Anybody who makes a mistake against Marquez will pay with a hard counter punch just look at what happened to Joel "El Cepillo" Casamayor in his last fight against J.M.Marquez.<br>  <br>  My final prediction Juan Manuel Marquez stops Juan Diaz in the late rounds winning by TKO!|`|ElH6jMEXaa	Hopefully Marquez isn't looking past Diaz towards a 3rd shot at Manny.

It is also VERY expensive. If it is not a team already, it is most likely because they do not have it budgeted for one. I think the most you can do is start a club. Usually for clubs you just have to have a teacher to be the advisor and fill out some paperwork. A lot of times the clubs turn into real sports when they see that they are all working out. You will have to find tournaments and stuff and do fundraisers to raise money for the outfits and equipment and stuff, but if it works out the school might just catch on. Sometimes they give clubs a little bit of a budget too :)

After you use a gun cleaning solvent like Hoppe's #9 I would use a gun oil or lube and put a light coat of oil on any moving metal parts and the barrel.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	You should clean the barrel before using to remove any leftover metal shavings. Plus to remove the grease already on the gun and oil the points of metal to metal contact.I always clean my guns when I'm done using them.|`|dpSr0icwaa	I use degreaser in two situations<br>  <br>  #1 when I receive a new gun I take degreaser to it to remove any factory storage compounds placed on the gun.<br>  <br>  #2 when cleaning my rifle, when I reuse the bronze brush on the barrel I will blast it with degreaser first, so I am not dragging the gunk from last time through the barrel again.<br>  <br>  For your handgun, new from the factory, I always recommend giving it a real good degreasing, then lubing it up well. There should be no need for powder solvents and brushing, just degreasing and relubing.  Rarely is the oils and greases applied at the factory for long term storage ideal for keeping the gun cycling, it is being used as a protector not a lubricant.<br>  <br>  for a handgun I'd not worry about #2 ever, you just don't even need to get the barrel spotless, it won't impact your accuracy for a handgun.<br>  <br>  Simply keep the chamber nice and clean so the rounds will always chamber just fine, then run a few passes down the barrel and call her clean.  Apply some oil all over to keep the gun from rusting, but also go ahead and put some oil on it before shooting too.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	1. Read the manual.<br>  2. Read the manual.<br>  3. Field strip and inspect all parts.<br>  4. Take >200 rounds of ammo and some light oil to the range.<br>  5. Load one round in magazine. Shoot.<br>  6. Load two rounds in magazine. Shoot both.<br>  7. Continue with rest of ammo.<br>  8. If any failures to feed occur, unload and apply some light oil.  With Glock chances are very slim you'll have any malfunction.<br>  9. Clean and repeat at least twice before trusting gun for carry.|`|bnJPvsVWaa	Before you do anything, read your owner's manual for the Glock.  It is recommended that you shoot through the factory lubricant, which is applied in part to help smooth any rough edges on the pistol.   <br>  <br>  Once you do clean it (your manual should give you a recommended number of rounds before a full cleaning) then you'll place a drop of oil on each side of the slide rails and let it run the length of the slide.  Place one drop in the trigger spring assembly spot, and very thinly coat the barrel lug and muzzle, where it contacts the slide, and you're good.  Again, though, consult your manual.  It will tell you everything you need to know.<br>  <br>  Check here, for a chart...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.glockmeister.com/glubric.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.glockmeister.com/glubric.shtm...</a>|`|1c0c973b392b482e30be82d985344c50aa	No. That Never-sieze stuff that comes on the Glock can be wiped off and not be put back. My last 2 Glocks, I just put a drop of oil on the trigger bar and connector and shot it as is right out of the box, cleaned it after about 200 rounds and it was fine.<br>  <br>  ETA: you do have to oil the slide rails though. just 1 drop on each rail, <br>  This will help <a href="http://glockmeister.com/glubric.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://glockmeister.com/glubric.shtml</a>|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	Re-grease, or de-grease it?  No to de-grease and yes (in a manner of speaking) to re-greasing.  That is, you should clean and lub your Glock after every shooting session.  I use Breakfree lub but any quality gun lub will work fine.<br>  <br>  H

As mentioned above use a steel leader to stop the pike from biting through. Using braid like power pro will also give you more control and better bite detection, although a co-polymer will also work well.|`|z4IcQZGdaa	No doubt! i do it all the time, as a matter of fact i usually have a rapala shad rap or daredevl on my medium action spinning rod which i commonly catch pike on, and both of my baitcasting rods are medium action and i catch over 50 a year i bet, not to mention i occasionally catch them on my 4'6" ULTRALIGHT rod, as long as you can fight the fish and your line will hold up you should be fine|`|hnGv17gEaa	Absolutely.

N0N9FzEhaa	BED WETTER!!!!|`|5cvKJNXLaa	Just do it|`|ETkqlgqwaa	1) Come up with a creative concept...<br>  Example: With Melina as the new Women's champion, Mickie James is a little sick of her show boating and is tired of Melina tagging her self in just when Mickie gets momentum and ends up getting the victory. <br>  <br>  2) Make A Distraction:<br>  Example: Beth Phoenix confronts Mickie backstage and tells her to join with her, and say's they'll be unstoppable. Mickie slaps her in the face.<br>  <br>  3) Make A Twist:<br>  Example: After a tag match, Melina is showing off to the crowd and getting the cheers and so Mickie kicks her in the head, and walks off the apron, ignoring Beth.<br>  <br>  4) Another Distraction (These are optional. I use them for a better Twist)<br>  Example: Beth again says she likes Mickie's spunk and asks her to join with her, but Mickie walks off.<br>  <br>  5) Make It Official (Flaunt What You've Got)<br>  Example: Mickie James attacks Melina after Melinas match with Jillian. And shows she wants her title. Later in an interview, Mickie says she doesn't want friends. She's tired of waiting for Melina to lose the title to a heel, so she can be in the running for the gold. [You're showing that she's deff. a tweener. So we know where everyone is leading to the big grudge)<br>  <br>  6: Build A Grudge:<br>  Example: Mickie attacks Melina on occasion, and Melina attacks Mickie. A huge grudge builds and Mickie beats Beth in a Number 1 Contender Spot for Melina's title at WM 25<br>  <br>  7: Lead it to a PPV and Add A Twist<br>  Example: It's Wrestlemania and Melina and Mickie are ready to square off. Beth comes out and says she never evoked her rematch clause with melina and she wants it now. GM orders a triple threat match for the title.<br>  <br>  8: Shocking Results [Last Twist.. Optional]<br>  Example: Mickie knocks out Beth with a Mick Kick. She goes for the pin, but Melina does her sitting bulldog on Mickie, but Beth breaks it up. As the Ref tends to Mickie, Beth lifts up Melina for the chicken slam but Rosa attacks Beth from behind and lays her out. Melina is dazed and as she goes for the cover, Mickie DDT's her and picks up the win. A Huge Shocker. Mickie is the new champ, and Rosa betrayed Beth. <br>  <br>  9) [Last Step] Final Reasoning and Conclusion<br>  Example: Rosa says that Bet was rejecting her and saying she could do it all by herself and that she didn't need Rosa, and Rosa snapped. Those two can fued, and Melina can get involved. Mickie can be drafted to Smackdown for Maryse and so the titles switch brands. <br>  Done....<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!!!|`|DvNZr4TAaa	are u serious? just think of something that you would want to see but it has to be reasonable. and then u just think of stuff to keep it going and then how to end it. <br>  <br>  it's called imagination<br>  <br>  try using it<br>  <br>  if u need advise on something like that, ur pretty stupid|`|b7JS16dyaa	Use your brain.

Wrestling is a performance art more than anything that takes more athletic ability than most real sports.

A study showed taking a slam in a wrestling ring is the same as being hit by a car doing 20mph, fake that!

Real injuries and actual pain take place, which is why calling it "fake" seems wrong. People should respect these guys, whether they're playing "good" or "evil" roles, because they put their bodies on the line for our entertainment.<br>  <br>  P.S. I wonder how anyone could think wrestling isn't scripted, with a guy like Undertaker shooting lightning.|`|3G87TjYtaa	WWE and TNA are scripted.  Different from the days of old where the matches were worked in the ring and not before the start.  Some believe that it has been for ever, but actually prior to 1950's wrestling was a contest without any intervention.  After that there were feuds of sorts amongst the guys because you were paid based on your reputation.  If I know that I could beat you and make more money the next night in a different town, I would stab you in the back.  Of course in those days they traveled by car and paid high end $25 (this being a mid card level).  Today most of the wrestlers are paid employees of WWE and TNA, back then they wrestled for various promoters not just one.|`|qMM6W3Vjaa	It is fake, but when they get dropped on thumbtacks and barbed wire and flaming tables thats real. <br>  the punches arent real, the only real punch that i have seen was when undertaker puched Vince at Survivor series 03.|`|jkIaDNTvaa	Yes its fake.

You will eventually have to get USARS (roller sport insurance) for when you bout. <br>  <br>  2. Like any sport its a little tough at first, but your stamina will get better with time. <br>  <br>  3. dues on our league are $30 a month. they vary league to league. Skates will be the most expensive thing. They will cost at least $100. You can sometimes get lucky on ebay though. Gear will be around $30 to $40 at wal mart. Check with your local league though they might have stuff you can borrow until you can afford and have decided on what stuff to get.|`|EfUFTXxEaa	As far as my knowing,it is a question with various answers,it is definitely depending on the your mind ,providing a great resource here <a href="http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.info/health-insurance-for-free.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthinsurance-onlinetips.in...</a> for reference though.

b7JS16dyaa	Don't like it, don't watch. It's no different than a TV show, because that's what it is, Ex: storylines and characters. Oh, and the blood is real, they slightly cut themselves with a small razor, it's called blading. They also suffer pain and injuries when they fall/hit too hard, so calling it "fake" is incorrect. "Scripted" is what wrestling is. It's just entertainment, and I know there's people out there who just HATE using their imagination, and prefer more narrow-minded things.<br>  <br>  P.S. As for you self-righteous homophobes who can't come up with good reasons for why wrestling "sucks", get lost. Why are you even here, attention whoring?|`|FEViNlQMaa	Here's my question for you, I know that you know E is for entertainment in WWE but does "Entertainment" only means fighting? Hell no! There are lots of things to watch in WWE besides fighting.|`|w173betxaa	That last time someone bleed in the WWE(randy Orton at NWO was real blood), besides most of the blood is real because the wrestlers blade, they cut the skin over their eyebrow, then the sweat makes it look like at lot of blood when its less blood than what comes out from a papercut. It's enterainment. And you should go in the movies section and ask a sister question to this one-movies is fake the moves the storylines and blood but why do people watch it?|`|OgkGsCkvaa	For me, I've been watching since I was about 3 years old.  I'm not too sure if I have the best answer for it.  The story can be good, and it is ongoing.  The athleticism in some matches make it exciting.  I think most of us know it is scripted, however, isn't just about everything else we watch on TV?  Pretty much a soap opera I think that was originally intended for men and within the last several years women have picked up on it too.|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I have a question for you, why are you here? If you think wrestling is fake, and you hate it, then why even bother to enter the wrestling section?|`|ch66f4w1aa	What a retarded argument, you could say that about almost anything on TV and cinema. <br>  <br>  Why do you watch them?

In other word, cut the crap and go bother some other people.|`|RbhIXuSyaa	It's entertaining hehe..plus i think it's funny when they throw each other out of the ring or drop each other on the floor.|`|rjWlOAnEaa	Because WWE has some interesting people like Miss Piggy, Spoonface, dehydrated/emo granny, etc.|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	why do you watch tv and movies?

Of course, if Harden stays healthy and Smoltz returns to pitch like his old self, it might not be too bad.|`|QTMCQ55Laa	you team is nice...u got power speed batting average everything.....but most of ur players have had health issues in the past...so good luck to those players....byw longoria is gonna b a stud this yr....not sure about reyes thou...hes been slowing down a bit the past couple of years...but the mets have imporved this season...so he might bounce back<br>  <br>  overall...not a top notch all star team...but u got many good utility players...you will need to improve on your starting pitchers thou<br>  <br>  cheers|`|dhs9QBMoaa	I think your infield is pretty solid, but you'll need to upgrade the outfield and starting pitching.|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Pretty good for an autopick, I'd trade one of your 3B for a top tier Outfielder, or stud starter.|`|5jzuPoyiaa	u didnt draft and u got this awesome team<br>  u my friend are a lucky man<br>  but try to get one more really good pitcher|`|F65Km3Coaa	pretty good|`|AA11720887	I agree with the idea of moving one of your 3rd basemen for a hitting outfielder, Don't settle for just anyone. Either of them will bring you a hitter. Your outfield is your only weakness that I see. Your pitching is adequate but your closers are solid. You will do well. Keep your eyes open for free agents. You'd be surprised what you will find as managers make moves. I picked up Delgado as a free agent and dropped a weak hitter to get him. I traded Delgado for Victorino. Not bad for what I gave up.

I'm not backing up Landin because I go for Cruz Azul, but because I think he's better than him. Ochoa only made two goals this season, and they were straight outta luck. Landin made two good looking goals and two that were also straight outta luck, but he's looking better than when he did on Monarcas. But for your question, I think it's a little bit of both. He's becoming slightly better and Crzu Azul is helping him out.|`|jUeiFZfmaa	You are right his move to Cruz azul was very good one for him. I hope he keeps it up and doesn't turn into Carlos Ochoa. He is still young and hopefully he can find some consistency.Only time will tell but I'm confident that he is not just a one game wonder.|`|S6n5kC9raa	hes gettin his confidence bak wit cruz azul. i think hes better off in cruz azul than monarcas he has more confidence here and hes playing great.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	He still is an average player, its just some people underate him after Mexico didn't qualify for the Beijing Olympics.|`|JYErVWsJaa	yeah<br>  i say he is playing better with cruz azul<br>  i hope he keeps this level up<br>  Thank God la Maquina Azul is back!|`|qbPbvLuLaa	Don't get your hopes up.

lCR8d2hraa	I would expect them to take whatever sack master that drops from the top 10. However they could also take a linebacker. I would say that Everette Brown is a strong possibility. However with their need for a good complimentary wide receiver I would look for someone like Ramses Barden from Cal Poly in the later rounds. For a power running back who could also be a good slash-back look at Bernard Scott from Abilene Christian. If you are like me and starting to think that Matt Schaub has reached his full potential I think they should drop from 15 to maybe 22 and draft Josh Freeman and pick up a fourth round pick. <br>  <br>  So here are a few possibilities <br>  <br>  1st round Everette Brown 6'4" 252 4.65 DE Florida State ( Great potential, but could be one year flash, doesn't add much outside of sacks)<br>  <br>  4th round Sherrod Martin 6' 191 4.45 CB/FS Troy (Ability to play all the db positions and is an above average tackler and proven ball skills, skies the limit)<br>  <br>  6th round Ramses Barden 6'6" 227 4.60 WR Cal Poly (Completely dominant in college, averaged 20 yards a catch, with 50 td catches. Great size,lots of potential, very coach-able and a good guy off the field)<br>  <br>  7th round Ian Campbell 6'5" 255 4.85 LB/DEKansas State (Has some speed and athleticism issues, with that being said he has a knack for getting to the qb, and could be a sub package pass rusher and special teams standout)<br>  <br>  Un-drafted Free Agent Bernard Scott 5'11" 200 4.55 RB Abilene Christian (Decent size for part time back, has proven to be a natural runner who is much faster than his time speed indicates. Playmaker, for example in only three years he rushed for over 5,000 yards, and went over 2,000 the last two years and has 74 rushing tds. Proven receiver as he averaged 46 catches the last two seasons with 10 receiving tds. Possibly one the biggest hidden gems of the last few years, could help many needs the Texans have including running back/receiver/returner/special teams.)<br>  <br>  Dream Player <br>  Josh Freeman 6'6" 250 4.85 QB Kansas State (Great leader, real rocket arm which is not readily available for this draft, Very mobile despite his speed. May not be able to run like he did in college, but will still have a little shake and bake. A lot like a young Daunte Culpepper. A 3 year starter, from day one as a true freshman. Very coachable with an extremely high ceiling, and good sized floor too. Give him a season to learn behind Shuab then hand him the team. You'll be happy you did)|`|v1LTmLB4aa	In my opinion I would think for a receiver they would try to aim a Michael Crabtree. Andre Johnson, Kevin Walter, and Crabtree would be a good WR trio. Plus, he would look good in a Texans uniform. :)|`|Boc1Buuwaa	I wouldnt put it past them to draft another DE, maybe an Aaron Maybin out of Penn State, they could go offensive line as well. If I were them, I would go after a linebacker|`|gmgOEW4Naa	Rey Mualaluga|`|nAtBuBRhaa	I highly doubt they'll get a receiver. I also doubt Crabtree will fall to them at 15, and they wouldn't trade up to get him. Anyways, yes, they got lucky with Mario Williams and DeMeco Ryans a couple years ago. And I think their defense can still get better. I think they need to get a safety. I really think they need to get one. They won't get a back to compliment Slaton either. I think in the second round they will get a receiver actually. But, they defiantly need a safety, so watch them too draft one.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	we dont need a weak side receiver. we have kevin walter, andre davis and jacoby jones. i'd have to say go after a db or hybrid de/lb like orakpo or maybin. as far as a #2 rb goes i think we should draft one later on in the draft like pj hill or ian johnson. or possibly sign one of our rb's off of the practice squad.
c7992d905ee1715cf5c3ed1c09c6ee98aa	Its not good that they lost its good that they lost Blake Griffin because now they get to prove how good they are. They should have won last night.

Memphis|`|21XmVm6Zaa	i dont think griffins game will translate well from college to nba|`|xhHfXuKFaa	being a longhorns fan i agree it was a good thing! but for them...no. they need #1 seed in the big 12 tourney. kansas and mizzou are still fighting for it.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	That is what Hubert Davis on ESPN said and I agree.

AA10248312	Gehrig was the greatest first baseman of all time, and was a top 15 player of all time.  A lot of people have put him in the top 5, but with Ruth already there, you have to consider the fact that, in 10 years of playing together with Ruth, they won only 4 pennants with the Yankees during their 10 years of playing together (1926, 1927, 1928 and 1932, winning the last 3 of those World Series).<br>  <br>  You can look up his complete playing record here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gehrilo01.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.baseball-reference.com/g/gehr...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Some notes on his consecutive game streak that almost no one knows:<br>  <br>  Gehrig's streak lasted from June of 1925 until May of 1939. However, ONLY IN 1931 did Gehrig play every inning of every game. One of his 1931 games was played in the outfield (May 4, 1931, Babe Ruth played first base that day because his leg was injured).<br>  <br>  During his 2,130 streak, Gehrig was relieved by a pinch hitter 8 times, by a pinch runner 4 times, and was replaced defensively by another first baseman 66 times. He was also ejected from no fewer than six games during the streak.<br>  <br>  Gehrig did have some amazing games during the streak... On May 10, 1934, Gehrig played only 5 innings because of a bad cold... but he hit 2 HRs and 2 doubles and drove in 7 runs in the five innings (the Yankees were a scoring machine in those days).<br>  <br>  On June 29, 1934, he was hit in the head by a pitch in an exhibition game. The next day, he continued his streak in Washington, hitting 3 triples in a rain-shortened 4 and 1/2 inning game.<br>  <br>  In July of 1934, Gehrig came down with a case of lumbago. He singled his first time up but had to leave the game immediately after that (his streak was then at 1,426 games). The next day, he was listed as the shortstop and was the leadoff man (he usually batted clean up)... he singled, and then went back to the hotel to rest.<br>  <br>  The next day, Gehrig whent 4 for 4, including 3 doubles off Schoolboy Rowe, a fine Detroit pitcher.<br>  <br>  <br>  Gehrig was portrayed as a gentleman and a sportsman, but he was every bit as competitive as any player in baseball. He was mean out there, and he always carried a bit of a chip on his shoulder because of constant comparisons to Babe Ruth.   <br>  <br>  Ruth and Gehrig were friends early on, but Babe always had a condescending attitude toward Lou.  Gehrig didn't mind for a while, but one time, the Ruth and Gehrig families got into a fight, and Babe and Lou didn't speak to each other for several years.<br>  <br>  The fight started with Lou's mother made a comment that Ruth's wife, Claire,  didn't dress their adopted daughter (who was a bit of a tomboy)  as nicely as she dressed "her own daughter" (who was older and more sophisticated).    Ruth told Gehrig to tell his Mom to mind her own business...  Gehrig got mad at Ruth for insulting his mother, and their friendship ended.<br>  <br>  During their years of friendship, Mom Gehrig named one of her dogs after the Babe.<br>  <br>  In the 1926 World Series, the final out of the series was made when Babe Ruth was thrown out trying to steal second base in the 9th inning of game 7.  That marked the only time the World Series has ended with a runner being thrown out trying to steal 2nd base.<br>  <br>  In the 1932 series, against the Cubs, Ruth earned legendary status with his "called shot' home run.  What is less remembered about that game is that Ruth actually hit two home runs in the game, and so did Lou Gehrig.<br>  <br>  Gehrig hit 4 HRs in one game, which is something that Babe Ruth never did.<br>  <br>  When Babe Ruth retired with 714 HRs, Gehrig was 2nd on the all time HR list, with about 378 at the time.  Gehrig would finish his career with 493 HRs.   Gehrig is also the career leader in hits by a Yankee, with 2,721.|`|hMkb7H31aa	The attached link will give you a great start to the biography of Lou Gehrig.  There is also a movie "Pride of the Yankees" which you should try to see.  <br>  <br>  My impression of Gehrig is that he was a very humble person who just wanted to do his job of playing baseball.  His consecutive games played streak gave him the "Ironman" nickname - Cal Ripken, Jr. broke that streak a few years ago.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_gehrig" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_gehrig</a>|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	I think he did mostly want to do the best job he could to help his team win.

Yes, they have a couple good players in Votto, Phillips, Encarnacion, and others but, there are no superstars. They need a great hitter such as Manny Ramirez to turn the team around. (Not Manny, i hate him to tell you the truth, but you get the idea.) If they don't get a hitter soon, they are screwed!<br>  <br>  Hope i helped ya out.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	Because they have little starting pitching, but a decent bullpen.

UzhfaJH2aa	Not sure what you have in mind, Howler, but let give you some advise. Don't do it. A good fighter on the ice would be a whole lot better when he can get solid footing and none of the restraints of the padding.<br>  As for the mma vs hockey fighters. I'd have to put my money on the guy who is familiar with the ice. MMA fighters depend a lot on leverage through the legs, being on a slippery surface, he won't have this leverage and would lose his ground and pound game, his power kicking and his punching ability would be minimal. The player on skates would have a bigger advantage of being able to put more power into his punches due to traction from his skates, an added height advantage, and would be far more experienced on the ice.|`|Pq5Ds8F2aa	Mike Rupp took some boxing lessons this summer, something tells me he can hold his own on and off the ice.|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Brad May.

(if you were really serious)<br>  About the hitting against the wall, im not an expert, but it can't be to bad. it would probably improve your timing.....<br>  Also, i hear that ivanovic hit against the sides of an empty swimming pool when she was a kid- it obviously worked 4 her.|`|EZkKZtGxaa	You can work on your forehand, backhand, volley, lob, topspin and your slice.<br>  You can can hit it off a wall but its much better to practise with a person.
TEG6O7sDaa	I don't think it's wierd, I don't necessarily go telling people that i watch wrestling either. Who could blame you wanting to watch John Cena, HHH, Randy Orton, etc? They sure don't hurt your eyes, lol. Anyhow- I will tell people I watch it if they ask. It's kind of what you want to do as far as telling or not- I wouldn't lie but you don't have to be announcing it to the world either. Good Luck kid and guess what at 25 I still like wrestling too. John Cena is my favorite!! :)|`|9bry2rXyaa	are you afraid of what people will think of you? you shouldn't,because it's not weird at all.<br>  i'm 17, i'm a girl, and i watch wrestling four days a week. all my friends know it, and none of them care. my parents know it, and they disapprove, but don't stop me.<br>  <br>  keep it a secret from those you know would scorn you. tell people you have confidence in, or if people ask, then tell them.|`|b7JS16dyaa	It's sad that people care so much about what others think of them. If you like wrestling like the rest of us, who are others to judge you? I'm also 14, but my school is full of wrestling fans. Some of the teachers watch and talk about it too. No different than any other TV show.|`|qwdh7N6saa	you  should tell people you watch wrestling. nothing wrong with watching wrestling.  it's good enterainment.|`|UvMP9yOCaa	Theres no shame at watching wrestling. A lot of people enjoy it, and for those who say its fake and what not just tell 'em the money isn't fake.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	I love wrestling and all my friends know it. It dosen`t bother them and they kinda like it now to.|`|gNeFtZdBaa	FCK LOSERS|`|U3KAgO0baa	how do you hide it? you have a pic of jeff...|`|InX5Pfl5aa	Uhmm no I do not think it is wierd... many people are that age. and watch wrestling.<br>  <br>  Now hiding it is kinda funny though lol...<br>  <br>  Oh and if you wanna watch Friday night smackdown come on over to <a href="http://www.311entertainment.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.311entertainment.com</a> we have it every Friday :).|`|k8fMMxKdaa	im in high school now and in middle school i had a friend who i used to talk to about wrestling and everyone knew i love it but now in high school no one knows cuz im in a school with girls n some ppl will think im gay or maybe im just insecure but i just dont ttell nobody even tho i know there is a kid who i hardly know i dont tell him|`|mJvZhdAuaa	If they ask, be honest, there's no reason to hide something as trivial as this.|`|HvnFTNmCaa	Always be proud of who you are regardless of what you are into...|`|w173betxaa	only tell them if they ask<br>  P.S. i'm 14 as well, but i hang out with some people that do watch wrestling.|`|smcDn76jaa	Be proud shout it out loud.|`|YhfMrppSaa	Tell em, dont care. I watched it before now its boring. Too much of Batista and Cena holding title reign made me quit watching wwe.<br>  <br>  <br>  If u dont watch Smackdown, go to wzrradio.com<br>  <br>  <br>  wzrradio.com has the result for smackdown on wed after 10am|`|Hdr6pjfLaa	It's not weird at all. I understand it from your pov. Very few people know I watch wrestling and I'm a 13 yr old girl. I myself try to hide it from my parents, friends, family, etc. but I know I can't for long. They'll accept you regardless so might as well tell them. Don't be ashamed.|`|plhLIIeAaa	Hey, if you have Spike you can watch it on Thursdays, but it is TNA, not WWE. And since you are 14, you are old enough to watch WWE. cuz if you were 12, you might have to have parental consent to watch it.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Don't Be Ashamed.<br>  Tell Everyone.<br>  If they're Real Friends - They Won't Care.<br>  If Not , You Don't Need Them Anyway.|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Seriously, feel free to be who you are.|`|J3vufPpTaa	Only if someone asks, you should tell them. nothing to be ashamed of, imo.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	since you really like wrestling tell people about it|`|yetGbkdBaa	there is no shame in liking something
a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	I think it was Jack Dunn.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Jack Dunn, who owned the minor league Baltimore Orioles team, signed Ruth out of the orphanage and because he wasn't old enough to sign a contract, one of Brothers who ran the orphanage oversaw the negotiations and did a good job of protecting the Babe's interests..|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	Minor league Baltimore Orioles|`|V430UrvFaa	The Baltimore Orioles minor league team.|`|vVofB4DPaa	I don't think anybody did any singing to him.
w173betxaa	yes because michelle and maryse are the only heel divas on smackdown, the faces right now are maria, the bella twins, gail kim, and eve. thats 2 to 5 and vickie's fat self doesn't count|`|MJbfCODqaa	Then there would be too many heel divas...|`|YhfMrppSaa	Its on script. Maybe not now, later|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	no not really but they are so hott|`|i8W0e6P9aa	nope, dont see that happening for now|`|qbEeecndaa	no|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Maybe if that does happen it will most likely be Eve that turns on Maria.|`|b7JS16dyaa	I don't think it will, but it could, and I'd prefer it that way.|`|U3KAgO0baa	no that will give smackdown 2 many heel divas
XTEv4vG6aa	first find out what position everyone plays <br>  then find out how good they r in the field<br>  find out which ones can pitch <br>  if you have more than 5 days hitting can wait if not look at hitting|`|Gva0qq3Yaa	You are not a manager.  You are a HS coach.  Teach the kids how to play before you get into the Mets' dugout.|`|VuNpWkRyaa	hello|`|cbca6d8b850d0d3ae3315ead968020d9aa	You should expect there to be some smart *** kids and also kids who kiss your ***.  Dont worry about that as much early on as kids will warm up to you and be themselves.  I would mainly do infield practice ground balls see how kids field positions.  Who's got a stronger arm to a weaker one.  Pay attention to kids who just know how to field their positions for they will more likely have a better understanding of what to do when and how the game is played.|`|O3oqZsR3aa	nothing really. you might have to time them going from home to first. the players will handle their equipment. maybe get water. other than that not much to do. i use to play baseball in high school, and at our tryouts the managers just took it easy and watched.
AA12276356	Magic <br>  <br>  <br>  The only reason Jordan has a higher percentage is because the league moved the 3-point line in to the college level in 1995 , so Jordan could finally make 3's.<br>  <br>  Magic played when the man-size 3-point line was in effect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here is a great example of Jordan's 3-point shooting ability, which should answer your question:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akYsCU8bWNA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akYsCU8bW...</a>|`|dCiVtR37aa	unfortunately Michael Jordan, I would rather Scottie shoot it|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Easy, Jordan. He is the best clutch player there has ever been in the NBA.|`|ulIZ38jVaa	mj 4 sho|`|WT8CbURxaa	Considering that Jordan has made more career 3s at a higher percentage, I'm going to go with him.|`|TRogTUQnaa	Jordan, because it's a 3.  If I only needed a 2, I would say Johnson with a hook shot at the foul line.  If I needed a 4, I would say Larry Bird.  That dude was clutch.|`|U3KAgO0baa	Michael> All|`|eukf5RBZaa	Michael Jordan cus hes the best clutch player of all time. No one is close|`|xhHfXuKFaa	jordan.|`|Ch9TedMcaa	Jordan<br>  <br>  This one isn't even close.
f1UYyl3Qaa	Look, dont worry about it. You make the team or you dont. Sure it'd be nice if you did, but its not the end of the world if you dont. That should give you extra motivation to practice and make it next year. Just think positively though. I believe in you! I believe you can make the team!! Unelss your at a really good school, then tryouts shouldn't be much of a problem. Look up the proper forehand grip tonight! Then use that tommorow!!! Dont experiment yourself, find a regular grip, like the eastern grip, and just use it. <br>  <br>  Good luck! And i know you can do it!!!|`|Oe5BCMzKaa	not much point in worrying, what will happen will happen. There is not much you can do if its tomorrow, but if it will be the first time that u r using the new technique, u might consider using ur old one, if u start playing and realise that it just isn't working.<br>  Good Luck....|`|F0oyaI4Paa	Go get'em!If ya dont make,so what,shake it off.Just work for it next year.Dont let anyone tell you what you can and cant do.Good luck!|`|ia2kz4qyaa	do the best you can, you gotta trust yourself and let go  of the self-doubts|`|5HT9hgaJaa	I feel obligated to answer this question because i have tryouts coming up and i have never been so nervous. All i can say is you have to rid yourself of those fears and walk with confidence. That sounds really corny and you are probably like everyone says that, but really convince yourself that you can make it and your only job is to show how good you are to everyone else. I wish you luck and try not to care about what other people will think, you like tennis and thats all that matters.
3teWTOPqaa	Yeah, but that's what the media always does if someone wins Finals MVP, if Kobe won it last season, I bet most kids would say "According to ESPN Kobe will surpass M.J soon!"<br>  <br>  Pierce 21.8pts 5ast 7reb 43% FG<br>  Kobe 25.7pts 5ast 6reb 41% FG<br>  <br>  Now can you tell me where exactly did Pierce outplay Kobe? <br>  <br>  The Celtics defense did most of the work, Allen was on Kobe for most of the series, K.G was their defense anchor, yet somehow after Pierce's "heroic" comeback, he became the "man" of the team.|`|dCiVtR37aa	I think he's overrated too|`|oMSTg5rQaa	He is not over rated.<br>  <br>  Every great player who wins championship plays with multiple all-stars and great coaching, Pierce isn't the only one. When are people going to realize that?<br>  <br>  He's been a 20-25+ scorer and all-star for most of his career and he had huge games during their playoff run last season.<br>  <br>  Give credit where credit is due.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Yea.. ofcourse he has.. he has the best supporting cast in the league and he shows off about it... lebron has a much weaker supporting cast and so does kobe and they can both woop paul pierce badly...best answer plz|`|ExVTrokAaa	naw, he became overrated before that during last season when KG and Allen joined the team.|`|fWMzd7y5aa	I would like to point out that Rondo is one of the luckiest players.A retard could get assist playing with Allen, Pierce and Garnett.|`|k5TKF2rRaa	yes
KdhNCnEjaa	Pierce should not be on that list, he gets hacked. I would say Dwayne Wade belongs with Lebron, he has a way of making touch fouls look like flagrants.
l3ZUVqB7aa	Ziegler will close in 09.I think he set a record last year on scorless inning streak to start a career|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Nice problem to have.  I'd say Ziegler.  (Short lived hype?  I think the hype is still there.  Guy's a stud).|`|bK5QIdivaa	Probably Brad Ziegler because of his short lived hype of last season. However, they are both young and rather unknown so if either falters, then the other will be right there to take his place.|`|AA11403020	Probably Brad Ziegler.<br>  <br>  Huston Street left for Colorado.

Domingo Street San Juan City.|`|hlqj0pvxaa	This organization is from one of the original Okinawan Karate lineages from the birthplace of Karate. <br>  <br>  Kyudokan was founded by Yuchoku Higa, who was a true Master of Karate. I believe he was a cousin of Chojun Miyagi and learned many closed-door techniques and methods from Miyagi's top student Jin'an Shinzato. <br>  <br>  This is the very best of karate training in the "old ways".

tXFj8oSfaa	It was a draw.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	This fight took place in July 2007.<br>  <br>  It was a unanimous draw (28-28 on all 3 scorecards).<br>  <br>  Tito won 2 of 3 rounds on all cards but was penalized for grabbing the fence repeatedly, hence the 28-28 scores.|`|xc47S574aa	They fought on July 7, 2007 it was declared a draw. Tito won two rounds to 1 on all three judges scorecards, but Tito was deducted a point for grabbing the fence. There is not a rematch scheduled and Tito will likely never fight in the ufc again because of issues with dana white.|`|E563RzW2aa	This is an old fight.  Rashad won.  He's undefeated and the LHW champ.  Tito's not even in the UFC anymore!  He's out of his prime too.|`|j3OwcG6Maa	Rashad Evans and Tito Ortiz fought at UFC 73 in July 2007. The outcome of the fight was a Draw.|`|mpBC86Auaa	Are you sure they fought Saturday...Evans fought like two months ago. I think you were watching a rerun...and if thats the case then Evans won or it was a draw.|`|XwrhH1CDaa	i think it was a rerun because the fight between tito and evans happed a long time ago.......it was a tie tito was winning but he got a point deducted for grabing onto the fence so it was a tie

NO<br>  Did the Celtics gets some extra points or extra time outs? NO<br>  Dod Doc River practice the faking drill in practice? NO<br>  <br>  Just when people keep bringing up that PauZL Pierce faked his injury there in no benefits from him doing that,  It not like someone who call in sick from work because he did not want to work.<br>  <br>  <br>  or like he was getting schooled so he faked an injury and did not come back into the game,<br>  <br>  Please give this a break, There is none and was no benefits for him to fake an injury.
G3EK5XLoaa	you are hitting it "fat" or behind...you are hitting your driver too much like an iron...the motion of a driver is supposed to be more rounded, not triangular...the ball is already on a tee, there is no need to launch it into the air<br>  <br>  this could also be a problem with your timing. you should see if your hip turn matches your arm and shoulder turn. If you turn your shoulders too fast, you will hit the ground.

He also threw out the first pitch in the world series for them in 2005, not sure which game.<br>  <br>  Edit: it was an alcs game not the world series.|`|Z9Nm6eDvaa	I don't know, but I'd put money on it being one of the Chicago teams.. and possibly the Nationals, depending on if they have different opening days.|`|rmU0nujMaa	most likely the nationals they offered it him to do it, but its very possible for the white socks two since hes a fan.|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	Probaly the White Sox. He is a hardcore Sox fan. He wont even wear a Cubs cap! You have to respect that though.|`|joJhbkX4aa	Probably his favorite team the White Sox.|`|WPH6O73gaa	chi sox or nationals|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I'm not sure, but since he's stated he's a White Sox fan, and this article says the White Sox have formally invited him to throw out the first pitch, as well as the fact that every president since Taft has thrown out at least 1 first pitch, my guess is the White Sox.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	I'm assuming white sox.

I think a more appropriate answer would have been that " am one of the best"  But then again he played against the two best player in the league in Kobe and LBJ and he outplayed Kobe and even though he did not outplay LBJ his team beat their team so I can understand a little why he might get a little cocky when people are asking him about other players when his team won the Championsip and he was the MVP of it,<br>  <br>  And for the people who say he did not win anything without KG and Allen,  well do you think The Lakers would have been in the Finals without Gasol last year?|`|ExVTrokAaa	I started Hating him since the Celtics got KG and Allen and not to mention in the summer he claimed he was the best basketball player in WORLD when before his 2 superstar buddies joined the team, Paul lead his team to the worst record in the NBA and now he's the best?<br>  <br>  I hate him cuz he went from UNDERRATED to OVERRATED from one season to the next!|`|ulIZ38jVaa	i didn't hate him before i kinda liked how he played when he was alone plus he wasn't cocky as hell before he got kg and allen... so that's what ticks me off. maybe they got arrogant and cocky coz they haven't won a game before thats why, only allen is keepin it cool now coz even KG became a punk and he does stuff on the court that is just disrespectful ...<br>  <br>  lol at walter... i did't hear him say he was the best before.. DID you? fool!|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Naw, I just don't like his attitude. He got all cocky and said he was the best player in the world. Plus that faked injury was just retarded.|`|iEbl30suaa	it was the wheelchair thing that started it|`|MPz9APZDaa	He is a great player. But I don't like him.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	i've just never liked him because of things ive heard of him|`|b41cf14d8319aa56219d62c039eca8adaa	It's not because they hate paul pierce, but because Laker haters are jumping on the pierce bandwagon and acting like he's the greatest player of all time because they just want to see the Lakers lose. Paul Pierce never won anything before the garnett and allen trade, yet the Laker haters are always saying Pierce is better than Kobe because  of one series, as if Pierce won the title all by himself.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	i don't hate him. he just is classless and arrogant.|`|uxregJ0faa	Just recently. He started talking getting cocky after winning his first ring. Also that fake injury got to me. <br>  <br>  <br>  I dont hate him, just dont like him. Good player though|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Great comment by Mamba<br>  <br>  And its the same with Boston and Kobe, I don't hate him I just hate playing against him. <br>  <br>  There was no real Pierce hating before last year because they had no reason to hate him.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Proving my point, Jsmoove clearly doesn't know Pierce, hes always been cocky, and the guy who said Kobe and Lebron always out perform Pierce just doesn't know anything, because I believe Pierce singlehandedly beat the Cavs in game 7 last year.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	If you have a complete understanding of the Laker/Celtic rivarly then you will see why so many Laker fans hate Pierce. It's in the blood, lol. I have a genuine dislike for the man after he ran his mouth last summer that he should be the considered the greatest of all time. And people accuse Kobe of being arrogant? That was complete B.S.|`|HLzS2z9laa	Pierce is the type of guy that talk too much and doesnt do that well, against Kobe against lebron he's always talking but then they out perform him, thats why Pierce is disliked|`|AA11989758	Well I`ve been a Laker fan forever but I`ve hated him only in the pst year.Because he`s so cocky and thinks hes all good but really just sucks.That fake injury got to me too.
Oe5BCMzKaa	maybe he is just going through a bad patch, or maybe he just can't compete these days with all the new talent.|`|4lHob4JUaa	he's got wankers cramp.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Richard started his year at the Brisbane International in Brisbane, Australia.

9289bf36b0092af9fa7aa94f40349863aa	i wear asics<br>  <br>  Ree|`|Lol0iLfgaa	First, you need some trainers.  I'd go to a local running store and ask what they think would be best.  Asics, Brooks and Adidas all make great trainers, but if you like another pair better, go with it.  Nike trainers tend to be terrible, so I'd suggest you stay away.<br>  <br>  Then, you'll probably need a pair of spikes for track.  While you are at the running store, you can probably pick up a pair.  Sprint spikes should work for the high jump as well, so you probably will only need one pair.  Nike, New Balance, Adidas and a few others make great spikes.  Go with whatever you feel to be the best.|`|fJFgoYo4aa	nike is the best. for high jump and for any sprinting get some spikes if you have a rubber track. concrete track just get some good sprinting shoes. if you run distance then get some good distance shoes. when you go to the store, ask some of the employees, they'll usually know what they're talking about and get you a great pair of shoes for your needs|`|p8GJxmOYaa	ive been running track for 4 years now and i can say without a doubt Brooks running shoes are the best ive ever used.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to check them out i got the link for you<br>  <a href="http://www.brooksrunning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.brooksrunning.com/</a>|`|yXHoxO4Uaa	nike free for training !!<br>  they r very comfortable and u can develop stronger feet !!!
U3KAgO0baa	If they resign Fat Albert then they will look Offence in the first round,(they will be set on D)...<br>  But if he gets away they might look for DT help.<br>  BUT this draft is WAY better than last year's as far as WR's go, you can get a good one in the 2nd or 3rd round, Maybe even the 4th.<br>  <br>  But again LB wouldn't hurt but both Mauluga and Cushing  will prolly be gona when you draft...(30th)|`|qbOEN99Vaa	Yes, unless they sign a big name like Terrel Owens, they need to draft a WR. Kerry Collins is a great QB, but all he can do is pass, and hope there are no turnovers. I definitely think the titans should draft a WR in the 1st round.|`|6bV4s2cgaa	They are probably going to take a defensive back probably D.J Moore DB from Vanderbilt he can also be a kick returner too. But if they take a WR is should be Hakeem Hicks WR North Carolina.|`|c755a7ce9c9e50f79ac4b65b75c2db62aa	as a texans fan i wouldnt like to see the titans get better. a wr would definitely be a good move for them though, if kerry collins can get him the ball though.|`|rC6RD8Wcaa	maulaluga should not be there at that point in the draft if he is there by all means take him but i think your line backers are solid anyway...if ALbert leaves u may have to thing about taking the best DT available...my prediction is that they go WR<br>  <br>  Maclin-fell injured himself and STILL ran fast he should be gone by this point <br>  Crabtree-don count on it<br>  Kenny Britt-very good possibility  if they want to add size to WR corps<br>  Percy Harvin-Very Good Possibility if they want to add Speed to WR<br>  Heywerd-Bey-he had a very good combine and should be gone before that pick|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Yes Maryland's Darrius Heyward-Bey..... but who the hell is going to throw him the ball?|`|nAtBuBRhaa	Depending on the Albert Haynesworth situation, this pick can go many different ways. I say pick a defensive tackle if they lose him. But if they don't, they defiantly should go after a receiver. At linebacker, they could possibly get him, but if that doesn't work out, I think a receiver is really what they will get.|`|tOIhNyCJaa	Bradleylovespenut what's your problem<br>  <br>  you wanna fight?|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	Malamuga won't be there at #30 and yes the Titans should pick up a WR it would make their offense that much better Hakeem Nicks from North Carolina might be there|`|1AzCDrO6aa	I think the titans will not draft a WR that early. they probably draft some one to replace haynesworth. they will draft a WR in the later round.

sLVGdCOTaa	I have always thought his super year was suspicious, same with Gonzalez, Maybe he just experimented with Roids that season and quit, There were many out of nowhere guys who never repeated the same stats, Javy Lopez, Dye, Texiera, Obviously Sosa, McGwire, maybe Helton, Konerko, Beltran, Delgado, It's gotten to the point where it could be anybody and it's a sad state for baseball.|`|O3oqZsR3aa	maybe he did. but they didn't test back then. all the guys from that period before 2003 that did are testifying on their own, jose canseco namely. all the others didn't come out but got their positive results leaked either via the mitchell report or SI (a-rod). brady probably did it quietly and didn't bring in any trainer. just took it for one year and stopped.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	He was, the thing about him is that he retired in 2002 and did so quietly. He never appeared before Congress and has lived his post-baseball life in a quiet manner.|`|Dilobt5gaa	he actually is accused of it where i am. It's kind of old news though, so its not talked about too much|`|7d2ed527dde89c1fc1c143c96fcb64e7aa	You should have a little more to go on before you accuse someone of something that could be career ending or get them in legal hot water.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	1) He's retired, and retired long before the steroid scandal came out.  He was probably forgotten by most.<br>  <br>  2) He had one good season, thats not proof of steroid use.  If he was using steroids and thats the reason for jumping to 50 HRs, why did he stop?  No one was testing then.  There was absolutely no talk of steroids in 96, so why wouldn't he have kept using.  It was just one great season, an anomoly, that never happened again.<br>  <br>  3) Even if he did, no one cares about him.  He's not a high profile player, he wasn't a superstar, he wasn't anything amazing.|`|hR87A418aa	WELL because <br>  <br>  1. he is a nobody.. idk how u heard of him<br>  2. he didn't have 400+ homeruns so ppl dont care<br>  3. he wasn't  making top dollars|`|dhs9QBMoaa	I've brought the same question up in the past.<br>  Add Todd Helton to the list.

jO1YCneoaa	What I do to make sure I am hitting down on the ball is:<br>  1.  set up with ball in middle to back of your stance<br>  2.  make sure weight is on your forward foot.<br>  3.  concentrate on a spot on the back of the ball.  This will be your target to hit.  <br>  <br>  By doing this, you won't chunk the ball by hitting behind it and you will hit down on the back side and will create a divot.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to replace the divot or cover with sand.|`|Au1BaZqPaa	Hitting down is a good start. Look at the site in my source it provides golf lessons if you sign up.|`|jKdVtDx7aa	Sounds like you are not hitting down on the ball. The divot will then appear in front of where your ball was struck.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	tell yourself to aim for the top of the grass just behind the ball.
DeSCJn0paa	Ok for one thing Aspostolic Girl doesn't know **** about weight lifting! And Nick Had some really good pointers. <br>  <br>  This might help some to. Not only take in more protein takin more carbs as well. But not just any carbs carbs like brown rice and sweet potato's are really great!! Carbs are a primary form of energy. The Carbohydrates stored in the muscles as glycogen are what allow you to do heavey and intense weight training.|`|ObnYA9lxaa	lift with your back|`|0l5ClD50aa	HAHAHAH luke  your funny|`|M0qoqvJbaa	Set up a routine you can stick to and stick to it.  You also have to up your caloric intake, especially protein while cutting out the junk food.<br>  <br>  I hope those three times a week are spread out, you really need to rest the muscle groups you work and give them time to build back up.<br>  <br>  If you want to increase your numbers you're also going to have check and recheck your form and technique.  But that's too intricate to going into here.|`|iDkQv7Xraa	Just keep going and drink lots of water. Well when you are weight lifting you are supposed to lift only what you can so you dont strain yourself.

6yoQhXsOaa	He's a 1st Ballot HOFer, I think he should make it right away!|`|EKF2HdZKaa	yeah he might be a ballot<br>  he is definately not overrated because he is a great scorer and passer,a few years ago this guy was one of the best in the league|`|ulIZ38jVaa	i think he deserves a spot... i don't think he's overrated he does a lot considering he's pretty small he's done a lot in this league since he started : )|`|AA10248312	He will probably be a first ballot HOFer.<br>  <br>  He's already played in 10 all star games.  I doubt that there are many 10 time all stars who aren't in the HOF.<br>  <br>  He's also won an MVP award, and every player who has EVER won an NBA MVP award and is eligible for the HOF is in.  It's unlikely that Iverson, as a 10 time all star, would continue that tradition, most likely on the first ballot.<br>  <br>  He's also finished in the top 10 in MVP voting five other times, in addition to the time he won it.<br>  <br>  His career scoring avg is over 27 ppg.  And he's just about to 24,000 career points.<br>  <br>  He'll make it, probably on the first ballot.|`|7lHt7Af6aa	i think allen iverson is a 1st ballet hall of famer becuase he is one of the best scoring players to play the game and he gets his teams wins.<br>  the only reason he's not doing so well now is becuase he doesn't have a go to guy on the team, but next year i think he will be better despite his age.<br>  he might even pass michael jordan on the all time scoring list if he stays healthy|`|H8u7gMAYaa	He is definitely a 1st ballot Hall of Famer. & no he is not overrated.
Lol0iLfgaa	You are pushing it quite a bit, but I guess anything is possible.  <br>  <br>  The most common cause of shin splints are bad shoes.  How old are your shoes?  Are they running shoes?  If not, I'd suggest going to the local running store to pick up a pair.  They are a bit pricey, but they will be worth it to your body if you plan on running a half marathon.<br>  <br>  Once you get your shoes, start putting in miles.  Don't start out big, just maybe go 5 miles 3 days a week, with easy jogs two other days.  After you get in better shape, start increasing the mileage of one of your 5 mile runs.  Don't over do it.  If your body is REALLY tired, stop.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  If the shoes are new, then I doubt they are the problem.  Running on a treadmill and on indoor tracks can often cause shin splints;  try running on a trail or bike path.  Also, try and stretch it out every day.  It could just be tight.|`|OHs8yJiOaa	That's probably pushing it. If anything, being aerobically fit already increases your odds for injury, too, since your aerobic system is ready to go but your bones, joints, etc. really aren't.<br>  <br>  You really should normally have at least a couple months to safely adapt to the pounding, get your shoes and diet right, and so on, let alone try a half marathon.<br>  <br>  If you don't mind alternating run-walk and your primary goal is to finish, you can hopefully complete it. Do be careful though, and keep in mind it's better to go into it 10% undertrained than 1% overtrained. Be careful about pushing too hard in the event, too. And if it's getting closer to the event and you flat-out know it's going to be a bad idea, the injury risk won't be worth the reward.<br>  <br>  You might want to grab a copy of The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer. Its objective is to get people through a marathon with 16 weeks training with primary goal to finish, and assumes people are in decent shape to start (such as yourself). Hopefully it could help you get your bearings for a half in 10.|`|aKkDWz5Waa	yes 10 weeks is enough time just dnt laze out on urself its the worst crime.<br>  as for the miles keeping ur stamina up will take care of that for u. theres this notsobad exercise i used to do where ud jog...then PUMP IT UP...then jog it off THEN PUMP IT UP without ever stopping for a good 35 mins (about 100m for each, but u could alter this distance, nd as u get better at it, make the sprints longer nd the naptime shorter)<br>  <br>  splints: either ur not running properly or ur not using proper running shoes
b7JS16dyaa	It's the fact that the media runs down on steroids and pro-wrestling that baffles me. Why don't they rant on other, real competitive sports? Pro-wrestlers using steroids is no different than a random guy next door using them, it's their own choice. It's not like they could use steroids to win trophies and awards. The fact that they're "bad" for you is a different matter, and I think WWE should test everyone, and not play favourites on who they suspend.<br>  <br>  P.S. Steroids doesn't make people instantly buff, if helps their muscles when/after working out.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Um well it's against the law Einstein. and some wrestling is fake but how do you fake landing on nails and tacks and bleeding can you explain that to me?|`|UDqMdvESaa	I really never cared if they did <br>  I never based my decision on what a pro wrestler did or said|`|6n63DKYWaa	because they dont want  anyone to go insane like chris benoit|`|3G87TjYtaa	Well first these people that take steroids only are thinking about the now and not the future.  So what you have is a 46 year old that has to have a surgery or treatment because he used steroids.  But wait, he has no insurance because no one would insure him while he wrestled.  Well let us say that welfare pays, you indirectly just paid for it because 14% of your paycheck goes to taxes.  Or say a hospital does an emergency operation on them and they never get paid?  They raise the price for you to go and indirectly again you pay for it.  Someone has to pay for the problems that steroids cause.  Just think of it like this, when you pay 60 bucks for a ticket, your money gets the steroids for these guys and when they die you pay for it also.  <br>  Nevertheless, steroids are against the law.  I don't want to work and pay for other people's mistakes. There are enough people we have to take care of who should be out working and taking care of themselves.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Cause people die from the overuse of the "performance enhancer"......they don't die from heart attacks because they drink too much coffee.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Steroids are always bad in my view unless used strictly for a necessary medical use. Steroids are overall bad for the body. Also, it cheats the system of hard work. Why take one person who works his whole life for a career when another had steroids that made him just as good in any aspect.

I dropped it in a pool by accident, and it lost its pop. But!!! after 2 days of sitting and drying, the pop came back like it was new. I think its because of the carbon fiber in the middle.

AA11213812	Straight forward answer: Union Data|`|HVpeJzM4aa	jennifer has a point but not without it's downside. Nothing wrong with salomon...yes they were anti-snowboard for the first few years, but so were several other companies that thought it would be a dying fad, i.e. k2, rossignal, just to name a few. but now they make one of the highest quality boards on the market. If you want responsive, you want a stiff board and as far as bindings that all depends on what style you like..you have the rear entry flows, the strap-ins, and you have the hybrid: all with their positives and negatives. Flows are easy but some traditionalists just don't like them and see them as the next click-ins...while the strap-ins provide great support but also excessive and needless pressure points. i hate to say this but you can try the new burton toe-caps which relieve the pressure points but go with what you like best...not with what someone else recommends.|`|b384db6ad40e335e34a6b836f0c3ea3baa	I agree with Jen to an extent. I really like Ride gear (which seems like a core snowboard company) except they are owned by K2, who make snowboards but are FAR from a core company. Every company has pros and cons. I personally didn't like Salomon gear for the reason Jen said until I tried the Relays. These bindings are incredible. If you have ever surfed or wakeboarded, these bindings give you a similar feel. They are responsive but not restrictive. They have a TON of flex since the heel cup is soft, and they take a day or so to get used to, but I love them. I won't say they are for everyone, but they are worth taking a look at. If you could, I would try to talk your shop into letting you demo a pair.|`|mGTeNxpJaa	Solomon is a ski company that started making snowboards when the sport caught on.

I have also found that eye drill for hand eye coordination is important too.

U3KAgO0baa	Call A-rod's cousin!|`|juQY6M66aa	Do not take supplements.  Worst thing you could do.  All the excess sodium (each serving of a protein shake contains over twice the daily recommended amount of it) and protein goes to your kidneys and crystallizes with blood platelets to form kidney stones which are supposedly the worst pain known to man when you have to pass them.<br>  <br>  Not to mention whenever you drink caffeine also your kidneys go into hyperdrive in which the sodium and protein crystallize much faster.<br>  <br>  <br>  Anyway...  To increase your bench what you want to do is first (if you haven't been lifting already) do three sets of 8 reps for the first 3-4 weeks (every other day) in order to build a foundation with your muscles to later build on.  After that you want to start doing 5 sets of 5 reps with heavier weight.  On each set increase your weight.  On the 5 sets your first set should be 65% of your max, then the second set should be 70%, then 75%, then 80%, then 85%.  Not sure if you're supposed to start with 60% or 65%, I forget, but it'll all still work out.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  You don't want to do very many supplementary exercises.  What will happen is you will tear your muscles too much that they will not repair in time.  What happens when you lift is you create a bunch of tiny micro-tears in your muscles.  When you rest and recover the next day, proteins come and patch up your muscles and your muscles grow.  Your muscles ONLY grow during rest and recovery, not during actual lifting.  If you do too many exercises for the same muscles, they will become so torn up that they won't be completely rebuilt (or close to it) by the time you workout again so you're actually just decreasing your results.  Do the above program I explained.  If you must do more, just do tricep extensions or pushups will help some.|`|PC60YeBIaa	There should be some kind of mechanism there to do it without that much of an effort.|`|cmkMBwTTaa	well u can also drink protein that helps. ur a tall sohphmore tho and yea u do need to lift alot but you gota let your body heal also|`|BV3g3vA5aa	how fast are you|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Do your chest presses with dumbells instead of straight bar, you stretch the muscle more with bells because they come down farther also they are better for your rotator cuff.

juQY6M66aa	You're doing something wrong with all of your lifts.<br>  <br>  When benching, make sure your back is not arched.<br>  <br>  When squatting, going down two inches is not a squat.  You have to go down until your upper legs are parallel to the floor.<br>  <br>  Cleans you should not be arching your back and you should not be reverse curling the bar.  You should be pulling it up to your neck and then snapping under, not pulling it up your belly button and reverse curling it.<br>  <br>  You either have terrible form or you're lieing to make yourself feel better.<br>  <br>  <br>  No, you could still arch your back, bounce the weight off your chest to gain momentum, move the weight further up along your body than where it should be to make it easier, there are many things that could go wrong.<br>  <br>  The cleans aren't necessarily your fault if you're doing them wrong.

They seem like a slamdunk for favourites to make the finals. While anything on paper is subject to error, that has to be where the odds are laying right now.|`|x6OsAvQeaa	San Jose Sharks. I havent seen a better team than them all season. They have incredible depth down the middle (Patrick Marleau, Joe Thornton, Joe Pavelski and Jeremy Roenick). This is arguably the Sharks' greatest asset, followed closely by their goalie Evgeni Nabokov and their huge defense. There isnt a team out there that has better depth, talent or experience down the middle. Even the Red Wings cant match this group of centers. The Sharks wear down opponents not only with relentless attack but with size. Almost all their forwards are in the 220-240 pound range. Home ice is another factor that I think will push the Sharks to the top. Their 26-2-3 home ice record is number 1 in the NHL and if they finish in first place overall at season's end this could be decisive. They would have home ice advantage throughout the playoffs in this case. I dont even think the Red Wings could beat the Sharks in a best of seven with the first two games in San Jose. I really think this is the year for the Sharks. They dont have any weak links right now and I dont think they will make a deal at the NHL trade deadline. They dont need anybody and nobody has to go. They are perfect in every way possible. And yes they do have Stanley Cup experience. Dan Boyle, who won the Cup with Tampa Bay in 2004, and Rob Blake, who won the Cup with Colorado in 2001, have been there before and know what it takes to get it done. The Sharks' strengths coupled with the mere fact thats its very difficult to win two Cups in a row puts the Red Wings at a disadvantage here. The Red Wings were the last team to win back to back Cups (1997 and 1998) but this Red Wings team is not the Scotty Bowman coached team they were back in the 90s. Mike Babcock is a great coach but nobody is going to confuse him with the legendary Bowman, who coached at the NHL level in 5 different decades.|`|TBUzQPXmaa	Probably either the Bruins or the Sharks.<br>  <br>  I'll be LUCKY enough that my Penguins can even get into the playoffs.<br>  <br>  What a dissappointment.

Staying shallow lets you get familiar with your gear and comfortable with diving.|`|OffM2Ndiaa	the first certification is 30ft. but you can skip that and go to 60 ft. either is fine. i would recommend 30 ft. that way you can get used to it before going deeper.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	PADI does recommend that the newly certified diver dive to no more than 60 ft.

I suspect 56cm would be a bit too large for you.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	It would be better to go slightly smaller then too large.  The 56 will be too large.
XfClBIP8aa	the only other guy in mma who has even come close to replicating the success of maia's jiu jitsu is jacare but at this point i feel maia has evolved his game to be best suited for mma.  so yes, he is the best.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Maia is the man!  He will probably have to fight Nate next for a shot at Anderson, and as long as he can find a way to take the fight to the ground, I'm not sure if anyone could stop or submit him.  I saw him get out of a tight chokehold from Jason Macdonald and reapply one to him that made him tap in five seconds, rarely have I seen someone get out of such a tight hold before and not get gassed in the process.|`|213fgac7aa	probably gonna beat anderson (hopefully) anderson is junk on the ground. very basic BJJ triangle is pretty much all he does. mean Ground and Pound but weak BJJ
4uSRVZNNaa	as far as I know you have to already be in a league.  either go on one of your leagues home page and there is a link to the mock draft lobby right above the standings or go to the fantasy baseball home page and there is a link next to the listing for your leagues under draft status.
OrG2fBbKaa	There are always many contributing factors to any broken leg or other ski injury.  Any setting should hold a person on the ski but release when needed. The binding settings are for an average size person with average bone density.  Before any true answer can be given,  much more information must be gathered.  This includes your son's health, the actual pair of bindings and a chain of custody for those bindings. They would need to be tested by a certified testing laboratory.  Also how the skis were taken care of after the rental and before the accident and since the accident.  In reality, if you are looking for a reason it happened and a responsibility for it you would need to contact an attorney, and a certified testing facility with experience in the ski binding industry.|`|TYxbaE4paa	Don't blame the fact that your son broke his leg on the ski.  Blame it on the careless skier!<br>  Because a 123 ski is perfect for a kid that size.|`|0PgAcFmfaa	For someone to properly answer this question you need to include your sons age, as well as the bootsole length of the boots that he was wearing at the time of his injury.|`|dXcKyKwXaa	yes

GLd6cmlcaa	If you have access to a gym use it to weight train. Building a little muscle never hurt anyone and defenders should be relatively strong. But lift smartly do your research. If you don't have access to a gym then do bodyweight training. Ex. push ups, pull ups, sit ups. You're running which is great keep that up, but you're training for endurance, you should also try to build speed. Even if you're fast becoming faster will only improve your game. The only way to improve is to keep playing, so call your friends and have a few pick up games. Since you're a defender have them take you on one on one. Look at the nike bootcamp videos, they have a ton of drills for self training. Do plyometric exercises to improve your leg strength and your vertical leap. You already seem to know that training off the ball is just as important as with the ball. Since defenders have to clear the ball so often, you shoulder try the crossbar challenge. Try to hit the crossbar from half field. This will help get distance and accuracy on clearances. I would also talk to your coach, if hes knowledgeable he can give you a detailed off season workout program.|`|5X0p45Zbaa	<a href="http://www.Soccer-training-info.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccer-training-info.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerwarmup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerwarmup.com</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.Soccerdrills.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.Soccerdrills.com</a><br>  <br>  its all here well good luck for Fullback position!!!
WTw9BSOYaa	Only the decks with Rocker have the difference with effective edge, so dont expect a change if you are picking up last seasons or a un-Rockered weapon. <br>  <br>  The waist for the WWW 155 is 25.20cm, for the 152 its 24.90cm, and for the 158 it is 25.50cm. My guess is the waist on your 152 wide is somewhere around 25.70cm, or at least 25.50cm which is fine for a size 11 boot, but a size 12 you should really have something a bit wider, I doubt you would get much drag at all as long as you ducked out your stance, but the 158 might be a better fit depending on your weight. <br>  <br>  I hope you aren't basing your snowboard boot off of your shoe size, normally the true fit is one to two sizes under runner sizing. Also being that you can get form fit inners, you could also go the route to buy a smaller pair, a 11 or even 10.5 and have the inners heat formed to your foot.
Cl6KbcAGaa	This is a redundant question....as a "good" high end Mtn bike starts at $1000 and higher up to $15,000  if you want it too. Now how much do you have to work with for starters and we can be of better assistance to you!|`|fk23CmWeaa	As previous posters indicated, you really need to define expensive and high end.  When I think high-end, I tend to think hand built, exclusive and $4000+ (possibly much more expensive).  Of course, I'll never actually spend that; so I look for brands with great reputations and lower prices and I've built bikes up using used parts from Ebay and Craigslist.<br>  <br>  Salsa, Rocky Mountain and Santa Cruz are favorites of mine.  I think of their products as boutique quality at lower prices.  Below that, I kind of like Iron Horse, Marin and Jamis as they're brands that make some good bikes at reasonable prices, but are small enough that you won't see them every day on the trail.<br>  <br>  Giant, Trek (also owns Gary Fisher and Klein), GT (same company as Schwinn and Mongoose) and Specialized are some examples of very big companies that make all types of bikes, from entry-level to pretty high-end.  Foes, Intense, Ellsworth, Titus and many much smaller boutique brands are at the very top end of quality and price.<br>  <br>  Of course, there are many, many more brands in each category.  If you're buying a bike, start with what type of riding you want to do, then pick a bike that fits your body and your riding type, then consider the brand...|`|jz9Nhhw7aa	A Specialized Hardrock!!  $460 will get you disc brakes and Shimano components.

Cl6KbcAGaa	first off Huffy is NOT a mountain bike!!!! Please don't get me started again I might have to hold down the caps lock! <br>  There are plenty of good names out there but if you want dual suspension then you generally need to spend about $700 and up, see here as an example:<a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25169&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> this is considered "entry level full suspension" and they get more expensive from here such as this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=26095&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> and even higher: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=26923&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> Now all these are just examples and any make and brand will have price ranges all over the place and it will depend on who you buy from and where you are as to what your bike may cost. Brands to look for: GT, Iron Horse, Cannondale, Giant, Fuji, Mongoose, Trek, Specialized, Yetti, Santa Cruz, and the list goes on....HUFFY is NOT a Mountain bike!!!!!!|`|DOVbF4Piaa	If you want a double suspension bike be prepared to pay $900 or more.  Stay far away from Walmart, Dick's or any of the department store bikes.  You would be better off going to the local bike shop and getting a hard tail bike.|`|AmoFt9AYaa	I think Cannondale makes the best variety of mountain bikes you can choose from. Some are extremely pricey, and some are rather affordable.  Obviously the more expensive you go the better bike you are going to get.  Personally, I think you can't really go wrong with a Cannondale.

GZpwkL1Vaa	No, its illegal. To cut block you have to be within the tackle box (the area between the outside foot of the offensive tackles at the snap of the ball). so if for some reason a WR is in that area, you can. But assuming they arn't, the simple answer is no.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ha i never rly thought about a wr cut blocking.  i would reccomend it tho.  jus stick to regular blocking. u have to be mean to block good|`|AA11135557	I don't think they can, at least I haven't seen it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just incase they can though, since I'm not sure, The best time to do it is when the guy you're supposed to block steps up to move in on the ball carrier.|`|juQY6M66aa	Not a good idea.  The reason O-Linemen cut block is because they are already very low in their stance and can just dive at the D-Lineman's knees easily.  WRs as you know are standing up making it much more difficult.
juQY6M66aa	Biceps are not needed.<br>  <br>  There are several muscles used, most important (rotator cuff muscles in your shoulder) are extremely hard to develop.  You're kind of just born with a gunslinger arm for the most part.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you use your triceps, if you throw coming in from the side (which you're not supposed to, but some do) you use your pectorals.  Your deltoids are used to wind your arm back, but the actual rotation of your arm forward is all your rotator cuff muscles in your shoulder though.  Sorry.|`|qAJWFJlqaa	you would have to strengthen your shoulder the most but work the entire arm out. just watch out for javelin cause my friend had to get tommy john surgery to fix his elbow. thats why i say work your whole arm but mostly your shoulder.

4TQiNW03aa	Because of racial profiling that starts at the youth level and society itself......and yes, it goes both ways. The proof is in the answers you've already gotten.

DOVbF4Piaa	I hope you didn't tighten the adjusting screws all the way in.  They are adjusting screws they don't hold anything together.  Turn the "L" screw counter-clock wise to let it go towards the large sprocket and the "H" screw counterclockwise to let it go towards the small sprocket.  If the chain runs off the sprocket turn the L or H screw in just a little.  When you get it close make 1/4 or 1/2 turns at a time. If you can have someone hold the rear wheel off the ground so you can turn the pedals and make adjustments it will be easier.|`|AyP3KlKdaa	You have 2 screws on each of the derailleurs.  One screw limits the travel at the top (high gear) and the other limits travel at the other end.  Play around with these one at a time to see the effect.  Then adjust each one to where it needs to go.  It should help at least at one end.  If it doesn't help at the other end, then you need to loosen the screw that holds the cable that pulls the derailleur back and forth.  When I did this on my wife's bike, I had to push the derailleur in before re-tighening the cable screw.  That way, it would be tight enough at the outside end (small sprocket at the back wheel).  You might have to do this first before playing around with the limit screws.  Good luck.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	yes your cable is very likely way too tight and you need to probably loosen the cable on the derailleur and before you do this take it back down to the loosest position that you have (smallest cog on rear and smallest on front) and start over again ...just type it in in google "how to adjust rear derailleur" and look at what comes up!!! who knew?

aUGM3ju6aa	Lebron also have a higher FG%.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	That means that Kobe attempts one more shot per game than LeBron. LeBron also averages more rebounds and assists. He averages more points while having a higher field goal percentage. <br>  <br>  If only LeBron was a good free throw shooter! He would average a lot more points per game, but whatever, he makes them when it counts.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	What kind of idiot compares LBJ to Magic Johnson?|`|MTbgg5eyaa	Don't get me going, mind you. Never talk about Kobe vs Lebron and prove the Lebron is better.<br>  <br>  Let me get this in the most simplest way possible your mind can fathom:<br>  Lebron better in terms of athleticism.<br>  Kobe is better in terms of everything.<br>  <br>  When Kobe had no great teammates, they all said he was a ballhog.<br>  When Kobe had then great teammates, they said it's because of his team.<br>  <br>  He bailed out Kwame Brown, the then-face of the franchise of the Washington Wizards.<br>  He bailed out Lamar Odom, the then-face of the franchise of the Los Angeles Clippers.<br>  He bailed out Pau Gasol, the then-face of the franchise of the Memphis Grizzlies.<br>  <br>  These 3 players should have been leading their respective teams to the playoffs, but they never happened.<br>  Kobe bailed them out, and look what they did to the Lakers, they played a better role of being a supporting cast than a franchise face.<br>  Look at Smush, Evans, Brian Cook, Caron Butler, Kwame Brown, Ronny Turiaf, etc.. and tell me where they are now.<br>  They can't be found right? They are with struggling teams now, but they once became a household name playing with Kobe. They succeeded playing with Kobe better than they played without him.<br>  Ariza was a benefactor of playing great with Kobe, and it is clearly seen this season.<br>  Now, tell me, these shot attempts don't define greatness or anything.<br>  Lebron actually handles/has the ball, if you watch the Cavs games, 80% of the time, therefore, the reason that he has his teammates more involved because he has the ball almost all the freaking time.<br>  Kobe handles/has the ball, if you watch Laker games, 60% of the time. Why? Because of the complicated offense of Tex Winter, otherwise known as the Triangle Offense. The ball needs to move spontaneously in the Lakers, whereas Cavs play a more simplistic offense, a motion-based offense, meaning to say, more of pick-and-rolls and long plays, whereas someone holds the ball for like 10 (lbj) and decides what to do thereafter.<br>  <br>  And if you would try to look at it this way:<br>  Lakers play a lot more faster possession-game than the Cavs, meaning to say:<br>  Lakers (points per 100 possession) : 114.3<br>  Cavs (points per 100 possession) : 110.86<br>  <br>  That's +3.43 points for the Lakers.<br>  Meaning to say Lakers play a more fast pace than the Cavs, therefore it would result to taking more shots, and Kobe is actually getting the better end of it.<br>  So, that answer's your first question.<br>  <br>  ----------------------------------<br>  The second one is easy, Jordan is arguably the greatest scorer All-Time, so using your logic, he would be leading the NBA in scoring right now.. I mean look at the bright picture, Lebron James manage to take less shots and played more minutes..<br>  <br>  FAIL.|`|Q9eXXF46aa	LeBron goes to the basket a lot more. For a perimeter player, he has an absolutely ridiculous conversion percentage in the basket area, hence why he has more points on less attempts. A bigger percentage of Kobe's shots are from the perimeter, hence him having less points.<br>  <br>  Per above though, let's appreciate the players that we have. We're not going to have them forever and it's a privilege to watch them playing the way they are.|`|1w9yuykxaa	*sigh* Kobe is better because he can score more and Lebron isnt consistent with scoring...in the 4th quarter with 4mins left your gonna see lebron passing thats the difference Lebron isnt clutch..(he misses layups) Kobe does not miss them in clutch momments.and if u ******* say Lebron is better..Lebron is compared to Magic and KObe is compared to Mike..so Mike is the greatest..and kobe is compared to the greatest and Lebron is compared to Magic JOhnson..so your saying if lebron is better Magic is better then MJ..OWNEd|`|H8u7gMAYaa	OMG Kobe is averaging one more shot attempt. He should be put in jail!<br>  <br>  Seriously, who cares? ppl need to stop nit-picking players and just be glad we have the chance to watch them play. because they won't be around forever.|`|MPz9APZDaa	Ah man come on, you know Kobe can be the leader in scoring if he wants to. He doesn't need to. And the stats between Kobe and LeBron aren't a big difference.|`|GERlmBIUaa	lol mamba is right he takes one more shot that lebron and know he is the worst player in the lauge how bout they are both amazing players?|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	because lebron is better and kobe is good but i take lebron over kobe|`|xhHfXuKFaa	because kobe tends too take over in the final 4:00 minutes. bron shoots thru all the game and doesn't really have a specific time he likes too take over.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Maybe that one extra shot is why the Lakers are ahead of everyone in the NBA right now.<br>  <br>  LeBron is a driver while Kobe is more of a perimeter player. LeBron will get to the line more because he drives alot more. Happy?<br>  <br>  EDIT: You typed all that stuff out just for 0.8 of a shot, honestly come on.
9ijwrcTZaa	I am not too sure, but Stone Cold came out and VKM berated him a little then Austin told him to kiss his *** and the crowd sided with Stone Cold and Angle came out then it was VKM and Angle teaming up against Stone Cold.....|`|3o8jPdWQaa	He screwed ECW and WCW. <br>  Dunno<br>  Why wouldnt he?|`|LSdCiHW7aa	I'm not sure what you're asking?

kqP7GwOcaa	It was a close fight, it could have went either way.  Over all, Ruiz never really impressed me much, and Golata had such great potential, that you almost want Andrew to continue fighting.  I really believe Golata could compete with the likes of Valuev or Igbrimov even now.  The problem wasn't Andrew's ability, it was his mind set.  His head was never really in it.  I saw Andrew's fight with Tyson, and I swear, I never seen a guy get hit harder than Andrew did the round before he quit.  It was a miracle Andrew made it back to his corner, truth be told most guys wouldn't have got up from a shot like that.  Golata schooled Bowe twice, but couldn't avoid the cheap shots, what a waste of talent, he never could quite win the big one.<br>  <br>  I liked the "Foul Pole", hell of a heavyweight, and quite a character, I remember the time he tried to bite Sampson Paou's throat out, it was about as nuts as Tyson biting Holyfield's ear.  I hate to say it but it was a selling point for the Tyson/Golata fight in Auburn Hills.  I think Andrew should have beaten John Ruiz, in my opinion Golata was a much better fighter than Ruiz, but styles make fights, and John's style made everyone he fought look bad.  James Toney solved Ruiz better than just about anyone, and Ruiz escaped that one too, Toney got DQ'ed after the fight for roids, go figure.<br>  <br>  I hope Golata makes a comeback and gets another shot, he was a character.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Anyone who fought Ruiz for any title deserves to win.

tPFikOY7aa	The great storytellers are people who can show their feelings throughout a match which relate to the story. For instance two wrestlers in a feud like Bret and Owen Hart. There story involved a family feud and how Owen felt he was in Bret's shadow. Thus you have Owen Hart wrestling more with anger than with brain which shows his frustration of being in Bret's shadow. At the end of the day he may be blinded by jealousy, not wrestling intelligently and may thus end up losing the match not necessarily cause he was inferior but because he couldnt think straight because of his frustration which is developed in the story line. Hope that kind of helps|`|7uQxuQr2aa	two examples <br>  <br>  bad guy beats down on good guy using "underhanded tactics" (poke to the eye low blow when ref is'nt looking)the good guy looks like he can't mont an  offense to even stand a chance and then all of a sudden he has a sudden burst of energy and comes back with signature manouvers .<br>  <br>  chris benoit vs mvp wrestlemania mvp works on benoits arm so benoit can't do the crossface so benoit has to use a diving headbutt to win the match|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Well a good example to use for this is the Ric Flair vs Shawn Michaels Wrestlemania 24 Match.<br>  <br>  The storytelling is the emotion that is clearly poured into a match to show the story. Shawn Michaels was reluctant to deliver the finishing blow and the sadness in his eyes was visible which is what makes him such a great storyteller.<br>  <br>  Edit: I disagree with the above although this is just my opinion not the overall accepted opinion. I, personally, don't think that storytelling is feeding off the crowd and giving them what they want. That is more of in-ring charisma or in-ring psychology. <br>  Storytelling doesn't need to be what the crowd wants to see, it doesn't have to relate to the fans at all. Storytelling to me is the connection two wrestlers express between themselves in a match and is usually used to fit storylines but is sometimes used to show raw emotion.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Storytelling (NOT Storyline) is the Ability to "Tell a Story" in the Ring.<br>  It's the Same as "In Ring Psychology" or "Ring Presence".<br>  It's Moving the Match Along With Fluidity of Moves , Instead of Just Throwing them Together Randomly.<br>  Working the Crowd , to Give them What they WANT to See.<br>  Going Back & Forth Between the Heel Having the Upper Hand , The Face Making his "Mini Comeback" or "Full Comeback" , & So On...<br>  Making What's Happening in the Ring Seem Totally Believable.<br>  <br>  Probably the Best Example was Bret Hart vs. HBK at WM12 in the Ironman Match.<br>  That Match "Told a Story" & The "Ending" was the *Boyhood Dream has Come True!*<br>  <br>  "Storytelling" , "In Ring Psychology" , & "Ring Presence" are All the Same Thing , Just Different Names.<br>  <br>  Great Examples of All 3 Are:<br>  Ric Flair<br>  Sting<br>  Kurt Angle<br>  Triple H<br>  Edge<br>  Chris Jericho<br>  HBK

"The Answer" is NOT the answer for the Pistons.|`|ISQAWUf2aa	Idk, but it is fine they lost cause they played cavs but they still have a playoff position if they have a 500% then they have to make changes.|`|sj8EM9ejaa	Ya the 2nd person was RIGHT TERRIBLE COACH!!!!!!!!!!!|`|dDhTMacAaa	2 Main Things:<br>  <br>  1. Joe Dumars<br>  2. Joe Dumars<br>  (3. Joe Dumars)<br>  <br>  All of their 3 main problems revolve around decision-making by GM Joe Dumars.<br>  <br>  #1 - Firing Flip Saunders for  Michael Curry - Curry can't get the guys motivated and Saunders was a darn good coach.<br>  <br>  #2 - Iverson trade -  Dumars and the organization got greedy for cap room and thought that trading their leader, Chauncey Billups, for AI wouldn't be too bad....it was.<br>  <br>  #3 - Dumars decision making simply|`|MPz9APZDaa	I turned off the game tonight, so I really can't tell you much about tonight's game. Maybe it's team chemistry. I don't know. Sorry.|`|GERlmBIUaa	It's cuz they benching rip... cmon man bench stuckey... let rip do his thing and we need someone with 'Sheed in hte front court!!! We need a dominant big man with em so we can score... DEFENSE!!! Where is our d... i mean d is what wins a game...best answer plz|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	the pistons are no longer a threat anymore. i don't even think they will make the playoffs. they use to dominate the east but not anymore and it doesn't help when you play a great team like the cavs.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	It's quite simple<br>  <br>  1.Lost Flip<br>  2.Lost Billups<br>  3.Brought in A.I.|`|fWclxi9Baa	clear and simple <br>  <br>  TERRIBLE COACH
JqSOfDiuaa	OU showed a lot of heart against Texas and they could've used Blake in that game. I think they'll play just as hard against KU, but without Blake it might be a KU victory. However, KU has not played any quality opponents but somehow they are ranked. they are seriously overrated and I hope OU comes out with the victory.
yg3Pveakaa	Haha you're funny..Then what could their name be.. the North Korean Bombers..|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	i know the Korean University team for Yonsai, they work their azz off, and YES...YES YES, i hope some of them make it, and they can|`|KTp27Fokaa	I like this idea. They can definitely kill a team's playoff hopes.

5etFAmrsaa	You'll go to the Raiders|`|lCR8d2hraa	Well Big Al I think you will go to the highest bidder so you can get paid. Good luck, it'll probably be the Raiders, everyone knows how they love to spend huge money. The Titans don't deserve you anyway if they don't wanna pay you.|`|iwV1WwMbaa	LOOKS LIKE YOU MIGHT BE ALBERT HAYNESWORTH!! AT LEAST IT SOUNDS LIKE HIS TYPE OF DIET. LOL. SOMEWHERE LIKE ATLANTA OR ONE OF THE TEAMS ON THE WEST COAST WILL GET YOU!|`|7oZv4KMhaa	Raiders|`|DNKNI27Baa	defensive lineman are strong and muscular, not fat. get your facts straight|`|yg3Pveakaa	Go to the Raiders your the type of player Al Davis needs..

c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Brown. You don't hit a woman, much less beat the crap out of her.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Chris Brown just abused one of the hotest and best lady in the music industry..I don't remember Pacman hitting on someone like beyonce or mariah..|`|ABoo1doVaa	Chris Brown can't cover the deep route, and doesn't return kicks near as well, so I go with Pacman being the better overall player. Brown is worse.|`|oPAi65Q2aa	Pacman, when you attempt to murder someone that tops my list|`|DPlJiWyWaa	Neither of them are great in my books, but I think Pacman is worse.  He was on a contract with two great football teams and he blew it all away with some stupid stripper incident and a whole lot of other absurdities.|`|98ec0bf2bcc110d92f6674ee557abcd3aa	who is chris brown ? charlie browns step brother or a cousin ? hands down it's pacman.pacman should have went to the NBA the thug life is alive and well there.|`|nHtwFfIgaa	Pacman.  If I were a team owner, I would cut players who repeatedly get suspended like him.  He needs to get his act up or his days with the Cowboys will be short.|`|0SdX6MpWaa	Pac Man jones, James Harrison (He belongs up there), and then Chris Brown took after them|`|xrCbyfu5aa	i dont remember pacman beatin on women in general. thats low in my opinion chris brown is worse for what he did.|`|f3DYQgzUaa	pacman !|`|HOYuWR4gaa	chris brown attempted murder, man he just put the heisman on that hoe..lol|`|X8NGHSP8aa	Chris Brown. Any man who beats a woman is just sick.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Pacman.  I mean, he's essentially Maurice Clarett who's actually made it to the NFL.
k5TKF2rRaa	Yes as long as they rebuild their team and get a new coach|`|xhHfXuKFaa	no. blake might not be that good anyway. look at michael beasley. great college player...but making a small impact in his rookie year. even kobe or Bron would have trouble leading the kings too the playoffs with the kings current team...|`|3teWTOPqaa	I am not sure how much difference a rookie can make to be honest, the Kings will have somebody to built around, but playoff teams, especially in the West, aren't built in one season.<br>  <br>  Maybe in 2010, the Kings can pair Griffin up with someone like a Wade, Amare, Bosh, or maybe even Bron Bron.|`|KTp27Fokaa	One player can't make that much of a difference. They are gonna have to dip into free agency if they want any hopes of being a contender. <br>  <br>  Remember when the Sonics got Durant? That season didn't go too well, did it?|`|wXxJUnLJaa	They will make it this year. Don't worry.|`|2wrenQfuaa	Hahah no...the Kings are lost. I doubt they will make much noise next year.|`|MPz9APZDaa	I agree with MC.|`|NuV7IsDhaa	Wat r u smoking?! Of course not! Thunder got Durant and look at thier crapy record!!! They have to get him and wait till 2010 free agentcy and pair him up wit somebody like lebron or Bosh. Then maybe they will win the finals oh and also they have to keep Kevin Martin so they will have some three point shooters.|`|DMkk2yuLaa	No, the kings need a lot more. griffin and martin would be a good 1-2 but when you got beno running the point you will not win, the west is just to deep|`|GIVarsPnaa	No. He is a rookie big man and unlike guards, they take more time to develop. He will make an impact in the long run though.|`|HiuNSScLaa	hes a rookie don't expect it but he does have the skills to but it's a big step up to the NBA
3teWTOPqaa	I got to hand this one to KD. I think he should be in the run for MIP, he has improved his scoring and FG%, and added a better jump shot and a driving game.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	KD. hes more consistent and hes a better leader. k-mart has been a little disappointing this year.|`|ddbVXDgAaa	Probably Kevin Durant. I wouldn't have said that last season but Durant has really improved.|`|OmT2BzJPaa	Kevin Durant<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry|`|Lxj6kMklaa	Kevin Durant|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Durant|`|DMkk2yuLaa	KD, not one person in the country thinks kevin martin is better than durant not even kevin martin|`|QVDJi2GTaa	His name starts with a K.<br>  And He plays SG.<br>  <br>  <br>  And my myspace layout says Kevin Durant.<br>  <br>  <br>  So I'll go with the Seattle Stunna.|`|9Injuk2zaa	Kevin Durant, you little emo girl!

Hxttt7G0aa	salmon eggs always work well in an area where spawning is taking place by trout or salmon which are almost the same species|`|0R46pYb3aa	It is very unsporting to fish for spawning trout.|`|q8dX0MsNaa	if you want to use bait, worms or eggs.<br>  otherwise, use flies or small spinners.<br>  fish for them the same as any trout.<br>  <br>  Q:<br>  why is it unsporting to fish for spawning trout? once they lay their eggs, they don't hang around like bass or cats. they just let them settle in the gravel and mother nature watches over them after that. they're on their own.<br>  the majority of streams (where l live, anyway) are restocked by the DFG.|`|aUAg83NDaa	in the fall jigs tipped with maggots ,minnows and spinners during a rain our right after use nightcrawlers against undercut banks as the water becomes clear and cold downsize your baits using sucker spawn ,magots and egg sacs all through the winter and into spring i use egg sacs and sucker spawn as the water gets warmer in spring minnows jigs and maggots work the best but you might want to try twister jigs and floating cranks you can catch trout ,bass and walleyes|`|KJWxqQHiaa	Worms with a split-shot & bobber is the best method i've tried.

WT8CbURxaa	8 times total: <br>  <br>  6 on the 1st team (2000, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2008)<br>  <br>  2 on the 2nd team (2001, 2002).|`|3teWTOPqaa	I believe it's 7.
ciQFlpuLaa	i'm sure they still do...|`|3teWTOPqaa	I just think it's a disgrace to the game, plus I think he stole alot of Ray Allen and K.G's glory when he faked his way to fame.<br>  <br>  Allen shot 50% from the field while guarding Kobe Bryant, tell me that's not impressive.|`|FUoKu13Daa	I just for the life of me can't figure out what did Pierce accomplish for faking if he did,<br>  <br>  Really, what benefit did he get for faking if he did,  <br>  <br>  I guess they worked on that faking play in practice so they can use it in a game,<br>  <br>  Oh I forgot,  you do not get anything special for faking|`|MPz9APZDaa	I don't know if he faked it or not, but I mean does that seem that realistic? A guy on the ground moaning and then leaving on a wheelchair and coming back a few minutes later all fine. Tell me that's not faking. Nothing less, a great performance by Pierce and he deserved the MVP.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Not mad but cmon dude don't cry over a bruised knee... but no im not still angry about it cuz its history but i will be ticked if that happens again (which i doubt that will happen again)... best answer plz|`|ExVTrokAaa	relax dude its just like 2 fans or don't know exactly but I've only seen lesss than 10 ppl and i'm on here a lot.|`|IA4x5oPMaa	lol|`|H8u7gMAYaa	I'm not mad at all.

Im also 14 and i play tennis once a week with the local tennis group for $5 each week and so far i have gotten a lot better.<br>  Your could also hire a coach.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.
Dq1T89nOaa	No it is always good to get more match play experience.  The longer you wait, the farther behind you will fall.  It is important that you start early also because you can rack up more points for your ranking which is how the system works.  Also college scouts like it better when they see a player start early playing tournaments.  Just keep on practicing and one day u will reach your goal.|`|UHxyxu99aa	No, just go for it. You'll be fine, just think you can win. Tennis is a mental game. You won't lose your rankings. :) <br>  good luck.
qbPbvLuLaa	Because Sven is an idiot. He never knows the right players to call up.|`|7Xridrxaaa	I remember too and he played LB back in the day. We were producing people in that left flank all over the place. We had Lozano, Guardado, Ramoncito, Salcido, and Olvera. I mean we had some really good left flank players. Olvera got injured pretty badly and since then hasnt really recovered. Now he has switched positions apparently.|`|N3RlL7mraa	HE IS REGAINING FORM HE WAS A GOOD PLAYER IN SANTOS AND GOT CALLED UP ONCE OR TWICE TO EL TRI OF LAVOLPE, HE WAS OK WITH CHIVAS, BUT IDK HOW IS HE DOING WITH TOLUCA!

rTSwouqXaa	Rodeo. 300 years of tradition of celebrating ranch work and a way of life. Getting on a bull/bronc bred and trained to buck and who is a master at the art. Its like skydiving without a parachute.<br>  <a href="http://www.pbrnow.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbrnow.com</a>|`|7ClnS9iaaa	Thoroughbred horse racing. Reason being is that I find it entertaining and I haven't gone to any other horse sport other than Rodeo's.. and rodeo's are cruel..<br>  And plus, every time we go to the track, we end up buying another horse!!! lol|`|FSSU21cyaa	definitely water polo! it's an all-around workout, it takes skill and stamina and there are so many different styles of play. You don't have to be faster than your opponent like you do in swimming because you can just cut them off, and you don't HAVE to be big (though it is an advantage) because if you're small you can weave around people and such. Also, there's that HUGE advantage of being in the water because no one sees you get all sweaty and gross, you can tan easily, and you can play in all weathers (except maybe lightning) because who cares if it's raining because you're wet anyway! well, those are just a few reasons, but water polo is by far my favorite sport.|`|4FWmdx0Laa	Its a tie between ice hockey and surfing<br>  <br>  Hockey because it involves many skills...One must know how to skate and then stick handle...it can be very challenging at times but theres no better feeling...Its one of the only sports were one can wreak a kid and not get in trouble...its such a thrill and i love it<br>  <br>  surfing because its an independent sport...i can be one with the water and surfing is truley like no other experience i ever had...i love it and i can be in the ocean for hours|`|PxtmMAMnaa	cheerleading. its amazinggggg. competeing is the absolute best feeling ever and it really takes so much hard work.|`|gmZLGuNtaa	FOOTBALL...<br>  <br>  and SOCCER =)|`|2XAzqFoyaa	volleyball because it is a team sport and you don't have to be amazing to excel! if you are tall you can hit, if you are shortish you can be libero or setter! everyone gets to touch the ball (in theory) and just because someone is very good doesn't mean that they get to hit the ball every single time. the ball goes to everyone! <br>  <br>  it can be played in the winter, spring, summer and fall because you play it in a gym! plus, its bunches of fun!|`|RejmKZTJaa	Baseball because there is no time limit on the game and because every single play someone has a job to do whether it be back up first base or actually fielding the ball. Everyone on the field is somehow involved. I love baseball.|`|5jzuPoyiaa	tennis cus im good at it and anyone can play and its a great game to have fun.  U dont have to be ripped or super fast toplay.  u just have to be quick and smart|`|cOkUsbleaa	Well I love Gymnastics. It looks so elegant the way they are extremely flexible and also it is cool they control every move they make!
mkUf3Z2faa	The Pistons placed their trust in Stucky... but in getting Iverson, they have destroyed the team concept.  Detroit looks lost.  <br>  <br>  Iverson needs/wants the ball too much to be a team player.  He needs to go to a team that has no other real players to be the only players.  <br>  <br>  After all it is  I-verson.  <br>  <br>  Billups was a great pick up for Denver and has saved Karl's job...Provided they can get out of the first round.
FUoKu13Daa	I think it just show how good the Cavs are,<br>  <br>  and the people who brought up the Lakers,<br>  <br>  This has nothing to about the Lakers,  The Cavs are playing good basketball and 1 game behind the Lakers on the loss column, and second best record in the whole league.<br>  <br>  LBJ numbers are awesome, show me anyone in the league stats that are better than his,|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Yeah that was nice. Delonte 5-5 for 3-Pointers.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	D West is the missing piece. Up by 30 at the start of the fourth, good to see everybody rest up for the tough stretch coming up.|`|MPz9APZDaa	Yeah its really important to rest your key players. And welcome back Delonte West, hopefully he can stay healthy.|`|IA4x5oPMaa	yes sure, so he can't get any 3 double or a 50+ point game  and people would start say that he is better than Kobe.|`|ExVTrokAaa	no, hope they lose their next game.|`|GERlmBIUaa	yea so he can do his amazing stuff the next game with great ease... also yea welcome back delonte lol he was missed now hes back and looks like so are the cavs|`|mkUf3Z2faa	Now you can see what Kobe was doing for most of the first part of the season...|`|ISQAWUf2aa	What matters is when they make it to the finals and play lakers i want to see them handle the lakers.<br>  <br>  LAKers in 09!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Yeah, Cavs are on a roll this season.|`|yid0jeX4aa	ya, its amazing|`|ulIZ38jVaa	yup plus delonte is back and that helps alot

U3ZBUOWaaa	he had a great run and almost got it.  But that just goes to show you what kind of year he will have.  Jeff will win some this year watch and see. We are only two races in....lots more to go! Cheer up!!!|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Other than blown engines, the race was predictable..<br>  I was sure Matt could do it, I thought Jimmie had a little<br>  more, but I think he slowed because of his teammates engine problems..|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	Loved the race, loved the win and am more than sure that Jeff is gonna get his win too. He was gracious to come to victory lane and congratulate Matt for that he gets kudos.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	Yes  I am fired up too. Listening to him on his scanner he sounded like he was back ! Last year he was always aggravated ,this year he seems way happier. He will be winning again soon !|`|op9iJRvBaa	I'm extremely excited! He is looking like he did in 07. I think it will be an awesome year!|`|XNdDrXAzaa	two races don't tell the big story|`|d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	Cry?? At least he had a good finish…. Harvick’s car went up in smoke tonight, along with his record no DNF streak of 81 races, which was about the only thing good he had left going for him since he hasn’t won a points race since the beginning of the 07 season. But… Jeff did have a great car tonight and it looks like its going to be a pretty exciting season for him and all his fans. I also think if he would have been able to beat Kenseth out of the pits on that last stop, he would have won. But Kenseth was able to hold him off, so congrats to the #17. <br>  <br>  IMO, the race tonight, overall, was pretty boring.... and pathetic to say the least. But that isn’t anything new for California…..|`|bBFiiSG2aa	I was very dissapointed. I was so excited that he was leading and in the top 5 all night. He almost had a perfect night. Kenseth's pit crew got him the win. Gordon and Kenseth's cars were so close that whoever won the race off pit road was going to win the race. It's been a great start to the season and I think the winless streak will be broken soon. GO 24!!!|`|fJd2J19faa	Your car was awesome and Gordon is a great sport.The 17 is back and on a roll. Gordon wil win races .I have no doubt.The best thing for both of us is we must hope the 48 does not make the chase. I would love to se my 17 battle with your 24 for the cup.|`|MYC6Xv1Xaa	The same thing almost happened to me.I was so exited and so mad when the race ended.What do you mean will he win a race?Of course he will win a race.I have been a fan of Jeff's since I was born and will always be!The drive for five has begun!|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Kenseth won again, so it's great.  That's all that really matters.<br>  <br>  I think Gordon will eventually win a race this year.|`|sGrrbz1aaa	never in my days of being a nascar fan that i would ever hear a jeff gordon fan be so excited about finishing 2...like dale sr always said finishing 2 that all it means you were the first loser|`|ziVpIxQ9aa	jeff looked good|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Today was a great race for the #24. I'm disappointed that he didn't win. But man, what a great start to the season! Sure, Kenseth is the big winner right now. He's 2 for 2. But Jeff has led a lot of laps in these first two races. I think he did have the best car tonight. Pit stops were pretty hard on him. That probably cost him the race. But I'm happy with his performance tonight.<br>  <br>  Yes, I think this recent success will carry into Las Vegas. He's definitely going to win a race this year. And I'm sure he will win more than just one race. 2nd in points is pretty good right now. Tonight was bittersweet. I'm happy with the 2009 season so far. I can't wait for Vegas!|`|nQxSAhNvaa	tonight's race was great! better than last weeks'. Jeff's car was so awesome! It's been a while since he's raced like that. He is sooo back!! wooo!! I cried when he came in second, I thought he had it... but congrats to Matt, happy for him. <br>  I am pumped! Jeff's determined to win and he will baby!! lol. I feel like this is gonna be an awesome year for him. <br>  I'm ready for Vegas.<br>  =)|`|9fAIXQeQaa	Maybe Gordon will pull off a win this season for ya.<br>  Wanna talk about crying... did you see what happened to ALL the RCR cars???? That makes an RCR fan wanna cry. None of those drivers had a chance.|`|TcLunPbjaa	He needs to pick up a half second in the pit stops.|`|anFNmvBWaa	this race was tough on my Lord and savior dale jr. someone cheated. good race for gordo
F2h9clSnaa	NASCAR usually doesn't choose the Grand Marshall. The person is chosen by the event sponsors and the track. <br>  Most of the times it will be an Executive of the title sponsor for the race.

FUoKu13Daa	If you look at some key games in the playoff last year Paul Pierce step up more than anyone else,<br>  <br>  Against the Hawks, Game 7 Pierce was huge and played better than allen or Garnett<br>  <br>  Against the Cavs, Game 7 Pierce and Lebron went at it and people was comparing that game to Wilkins and Bird but like I said Pierce won that game for them to advance,<br>  <br>  Against the Piston he was huge in that game that brought them back to home court advantage and game 6.<br>  <br>  Against the Lakers I think Ray Allen was the most consistant player and could have been easily voted finals mvp but I think Pierce in game 1 hit some big shots  while Kg missed his last 8.<br>  <br>  Game 4 It was Pierce defense against Kobe that allowed Boston to Come back from a 24 point deficit on the road and win that game,  Posey was huge in that game hitting those 3s and Allen layup at the end was huge but it all started with Pierce defense,<br>  <br>  The other games I think the players played pretty equal but like I said I think Pierce was more instrumental in the games they needed to win.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Ray Allen averaged 20pts shooting 50% while guarding Kobe Bryant, he should have been finals MVP!<br>  <br>  I wonder how many MVP votes Pierce got for that little stunt of his.|`|i0Igqvroaa	ray allen deserved it ... seriously.<br>  paul pierce robbed him.|`|ulIZ38jVaa	that's over with man that's like bringing up nash's back to back mvp over kobe lol he won it and there's nothing you can do about that... let's just see if he can repeat to make it legit. peace!|`|RBdy17Ahaa	ray allen deserved it|`|IA4x5oPMaa	allen|`|nunTclFFaa	yes... KG deserved it sooooooo much more... if it wasnt for him, they wouldnt even have made it to the finals. When allen got traded to the celtcs, everyone was like oooo they might make it to the playoffs but when kg made it every1 was like ooooo they might win it all. also, kg owned the finals (except for the second last game) and they came back from a 22 point deficit to win the game in Game 4. pierce just got it cuz hes been on the celtics the longest and becuz of his little publicity stunt in Game 1|`|GERlmBIUaa	I think htat K.G. should've got it becuase with out em they lose a bunch of rebs way less points and a lot of intensity and passion on the court...best answer plz|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Ray Allen, was the true Finals MVP.....KG didn't deserve it.....Paul Pierce deserved it more than KG.|`|H8u7gMAYaa	Not KG. Either Pierce or Allen should of gotten it.|`|k5TKF2rRaa	no kg's much better
GERlmBIUaa	Just that they are an overrated team and they want atleast some kind of contrast to that and that's their prespective... i personally like the announcers e.j. kenny smith stewart scott jon barry and michael wilbon they all have great info...best answer plz|`|Ch9TedMcaa	God I wish the NBA was still where it belongs, on NBC.<br>  <br>  Bob Costas, Ahmad Rashad, Matt Guokas, Marv Albert.|`|Jp2415Whaa	Obviously you didn't see the Celtics game today.  All they were talking about was how the Celtics were beating the Suns without KG....They mentioned Amar'e being out like twice or thrice, the rest of the time it's all KG KG KG KG, and "Wow, what does this tell you about the Celtics team beating a confident Suns team without KG." Stop ******* mentioning him, we didn't have Amar'e, Boston didn't have KG, it was like an even match up.|`|kfSuRisvaa	if i were you turn the volume down find the game on espn radio jim durham and dr jack are great|`|APqwrrpDaa	i know thats so gay celtics r beast.|`|U3KAgO0baa	You just have 2 take it with a grain of salt... but IMO the guys on TNT are the best|`|mkUf3Z2faa	They are nothing moe that media whores...they need controversy because they have no other insight for the games. <br>  <br>  They prostrate themselves to Lebron and have anointed him as the new coming of basketball.  They hate the C's because they do not like a winner.  The do not like Pierce, Allen is too quiet, and Kevin is out right now ( and does not need the ball all the time for them to win).  <br>  <br>  They love D Wade as well.<br>  <br>  Oh, and so you know... I am a Laker fan since the Logo was on the hardwood and they treat both the C's and the Lake Show with disrespect.  <br>  <br>  I guess they believe that the only way to the top is to be controversial and embrace some self appointed savior.|`|21XmVm6Zaa	I miss Bill Waltons crazy talk
agPn1LyCaa	nah, i dont think so. i guess in some peoples minds it may be.|`|iWaU76T5aa	No, it is actually for smaller school players who need to show teams that they have promise. Chris Johnson is an example.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Yeah.  I mean seriously, its supposed to help distinguish between players, when most of the top players just sit on their @ss.  Case and point, Matt Stafford, who I really don't think is even going to be a good QB, just decides he doesn't feel like throwing, so teams who are thinking of wasting a pick on him can't even see him live in action.|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	It has benefits especially for small-school or lesser known players.<br>  <br>  Just boring as hell to watch, and a sure-fire way for top prospects to plummet down draft boards.|`|tOIhNyCJaa	yeah they're super boring to watch I don't get why people get so hyped up about them the only interesting is the stats but you can read about those the next day|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Oh yea. Look at all the highly rated combine picks that turn out to be pure busts.|`|Vr79EjBZaa	yes...   very little of it measures true talent|`|BSU9pNUWaa	Not at all. There three big factors coachs and GMs take into consideration when scouting players.<br>  <br>  (1) Game performance<br>  (2) Athleticism<br>  (3) Attitude/Personality<br>  <br>  (1) Gamer performance can obviously only answered through watching game tape.<br>  <br>  (2)+(3) Athleticism and player personality can be answered through the scouting combine. Interviews through the combine allows coachs to see players attitude and personality. Athleticism can be seen through the various drills in the combine. They are very important to the drafting process. Players are dropped and raised many positions and even through rounds by their performance in the combine.|`|d99df786deb3c1bafe03741880e7fdd1aa	I think so. Anquan Boldin ran a 4.72 40 when he was there and he turned out pretty good, on the other hand, there are some who ran really well and set records and stuff, but have already washed out of the league. I don't think NFL scouts will learn anything new about these players maybe either than their work ethic or maybe some things in the interviews. BTW I watched it today on the NFL network, and there must have been like 15 people who pulled hamstrings, it was crazy.|`|98ec0bf2bcc110d92f6674ee557abcd3aa	it does serve a little legit purpose but it's main goal is a meat market for the agents to showcase their stock.<br>  <br>  the proof is in the end results. look how many top performers end up being a bust and go from  all star to falling star.|`|e00627d6bcb03c3c3a41eb2fe611f647aa	well its not really for entertainment purposes like the super bowl. It just for young athletes to better there stock for the draft. How is that overrated?|`|YFFhkRSdaa	in ways yes especially the 40 yd dash|`|zJC18FtAaa	No

0E8SPyyXaa	Yes <br>  1.He doesnt no when to call a timeout<br>  2.he doesnt no how to make good lineups<br>  3.when he is wired on espn and talking to the team he sounds stupid <br>  <br>  I give him a couple more games untill his Depareture then we get Avery Johnson|`|JqSOfDiuaa	He could just wait until the end of the season since they are not going to make the playoffs and then fire him. the Pistons are playing with any passion or defense and in the huddle during time outs they don't even look like they care what Michael Curry is saying. It's as if they don't respect him and that says a lot to me, especially when they get blown out by Cavs by halftime, down 33 and lose the game by 21 and the leading scorer is Iverson with 14? Ouch!!!|`|1AzCDrO6aa	yes. but dumars is also at fault for trading iverson. AI is a great player but unlike the kobe's and lebron's that you just let them play on any team and expect that team to improve, AI needs a specific kind of team to be successful. and pistons is not one of them. they should have stick with billups.|`|GERlmBIUaa	Well yea... cuz we need a more offenseive coach cuz if you havent noticed d isnt our best prospect... we need a coach like mike d'antoni ( i dont like em) but i like his style of run and gun offense... best answer plz<br>  <br>  EDIT: Na curry is more of a defensive minded coach (atleast this year he is)|`|0eMQDINbaa	They should have never gotten rid of Flip. If anyone deserves to be fired it's Joe Dumars. Avery Johnson would be a good replacement for Curry though.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	No, its not his fault. Its hardly ever the coaches fault. <br>  <br>  Detroit had zero effort today. Literally zero. What ever happened to defending?<br>  <br>  I hate how everyone blames the coach. He can't go on the court and defend and make shots for the team.

fzlHDkXbaa	The screeching of my shoes as I slide to a halt.<br>  <br>  I love how tennis is an independent game, whereas soccer and rugby are in teams, and you have to work to bring everyone up to their game. In tennis, no one can let you down, but yourself.|`|f1UYyl3Qaa	What I really like in tennis is the combination of fitness, hand-eye coordination, and the mental game. I like how I have to be fast, in order to run down every shot. I like that to hit the ball i need to time/swing my racquet every time perfectly. I like that I have to use my brain, not just my skills to win a game. How I have to know which shot to use at which time. I love how complex tennis. I love that theres so many variables, that i need to know the correct form in multiple situations, that i need to know where to aim it in multiple situations, that i need to know which shot to use in multiple situations. All together makes one hell of a sport.|`|Wjp0niEhaa	Why do I love tennis, let me count the ways... Tennis can be played by almost anyone... The young and old, the poor and rich, the famous and infamous... Shallow and simple on the surface, yet deep and complex beneath... A battlefield for the warrior, a playground for the child... A mountain to climb, or a relaxing journey with friends... It is what you want it to be... It strengthens both mind and body, and it can humble the spirit... Or reveal demons in some... Its just a beautiful, enriching sport, that anyone can love...|`|GNq2rmrNaa	i like the fact that you can do single matches and then you don't have the pressure of letting your teamate down, and in other sports you might lose because your teamates made you go bad but this can't happen in a singles game of tennis. Also you get all the credit for winning a match.|`|Oe5BCMzKaa	unlike in team sports, You are always playing and are constantly in the action.<br>  also, it is easy to organise a game, as you only need to find one person, unlike soccer for example, where u need 2 teams.|`|0pQKy43yaa	I  love the sound the ball makes when it hits the pavement. Love the build up of my strength as I prepare to hit the ball and then the release of it when i smack the ball with the racket.|`|UHxyxu99aa	I live for the game of tennis. I love everything about it. The satisfaction of winning a match, it's just so good. The feeling when you rip some nice ground strokes down the line. The social side of tennis. Watching tennis, the pros are just amazing. PLaying with new balls, or getting a new racquet, everything is just so good with tennis. I just love it, everythign and anything about tennis.|`|I8Vv7V9jaa	the competitiveness and the smell of brand new tennis balls out of the can.|`|Z2gIo6HKaa	not depending on some1 else during da match
Go4N4m8saa	It would really break my heart.Boo Hoo, poor Jimmie.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	Not at all, ask this question at the end of the year.  We've seen early season dominance that has meant nothing when the chase starts.  Nobody has worked the new format better than the 48 team and those last 10 races definitely favor Jimmie.  A solid top 10 run and one of the strongest cars at Fontana isn't exactly what I would consider "starting to fade".  The first 2 races of the year probably won't factor into the big picture much unless Jimmie misses the chase altogether.  Next week is Las Vegas, where Jimmie has won 3 of the last 4 races, and Atlanta has been one of the 48 team's best tracks.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!|`|Up2sP3eGaa	you predicted kyle would fade after watkins glen? you should change your screen name to "the amazing kreskin" or better yet, "the kingmaker," as your powers are obviously not just observational, but causal if it was your statement that caused kyle busch to fade. so i guess it's you i should be blaming...<br>  ;-)|`|NxBljj6Baa	He doesn't have to do anything.  If the Fords and Toyota's keep it up, just like last year.  Nascar is looking to give chevy their choice of a blower or a twin turbo set up for the chase.  So Jimmy already knows he doesn't have to do a thing, just ride laps out for 25 more races, and NASCAR will find a way to hand him another.  <br>  Chevy needs our help, help from the government and help from NASCAR...  Always has always will.  Thanks everyone for making Chevy's dream possible.  They didn't call it the heartbeat of AMERICA back in the 90's for nothing.   <br>  Any time that NASCAR hands you a torque engine package with 10 races to go, and all 10 races are torque tracks, then it's a wash...  Now they have their hands full to hand Jr. a championship, he couldn't out run a goldfish in a fish bowl...|`|9aa3974d6e3a58df61ffe6d9c9eaa029aa	No, I don't think so.  Daytona is a wild card race where anything can happen.  Today, I agree the 48 could have been a better car but the team could not stay on top of the track changes like the 17 and 24.  I think that it is an absolute possibility that the 48 team will see see the 4th championship in a row.  If not, at least a top five finish on the season.|`|7bc597034795bea4dbbecfea92484579aa	You are so funny!  And evidently clueless - I hope you are watching when Jimmie wins his 4th straight championship!|`|2Bl7zOO4aa	I don't think so. The last 10 races count. He might start off slow but when the last 10 races start, he'll dominate.|`|MeNtbYEpaa	its been two races and he had a top ten today geez chill out u cant judge a season on the first two races|`|nQxSAhNvaa	seriously? It's only been two races, there's a lot more left. They started off slow last year and they ended up winning the championship. Besides, he finished 9th, that's pretty good. <br>  .|`|d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	I think its only the 2nd race of the season and you're going to end up being very disappointed once the chase starts.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	I think you've given yourself too much credit.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	He didnt start out very good last year, and look what happen.   No Jimmie isnt fading.   He will be  just fine.|`|AA10767397	i think jimmie started coming around towards the end of the season. the first half of the season was dominated by Kyle Busch and Carl Edwards. then came towards the end of the season, sometime before the chase began, Jimmie started winning and shot up to the top.<br>  <br>  i might be a little wrong with my statement, but that's how i remember it.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	No.. Jimmie never starts a season on all eight...<br>  Well, almost never.. lol What is up with people..<br>  Racing has become more competitive than ever,<br>  the teams are running closer than ever, but to not<br>  win a couple of races doesn't mean your career is done..<br>  Jeff Gordon is not done winning, neither is Jr.. Last November<br>  Matt Kenseth was washed up,  no wins in a couple of years, <br>  and now look at him.. BTW, he just caught up to Jr in Cup wins..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	I'm sorry I don't remember your questions. I can hardly remember your name.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Come on man; if you know anthing about NASCAR you know that it takes Johnson a while to warm up.................He'll be right there in the end.

xTTP2Bv8aa	5 and the championship I hope!|`|Up2sP3eGaa	i've got to go with 3, 4 max. heck, even when he won his championship he only won one race. only in 2002 did he win 5 races, 2006 he won four, and fewer all the other years. he's more of a consistency driver, in my not-so-humble opinion.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	Instead of Johnson and Edwards duking it out its gonna be Gordon and Kenseth!

VRN4A8vwaa	7/10<br>  <br>  your batters are strong<br>  but your pitchers are very strong<br>  there are beckett and lincecum<br>  i think you need more closer<br>  jn putz is already not considered as a closer<br>  you can not bet with fuentes and arredondo to gaining saves<br>  they are in 1 team dude|`|HbTC1BBIaa	this is not a very good team, to be completely honest with you. i'd try to pull off a trade for another power hitter. this team over the course of a seaon will leave you in the middle of the pack. 6/10|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Solid batters.<br>  Solid pitching. <br>  8/10|`|Cu5GB2wfaa	Decent.  Get rid of JJ Putz and Jose Arredondo,  they are not closers.  Your starting pitching is strong.  You lack speed in your position players.  I'd try and package a deal of Miguel Tejeda and a pitcher and try and get a better shortstop.  Depending on the pitcher  you put in the deal, you could get anyone.  Tejeda and Beckett for Reyes, Rollins?  Tejeda and Linecum for Hanley? Or you could deal an outfielder, like Manny, Vlad, Carlose Q, or Magglio for someone like Carl Crawford, Ichiro, BJ Upton, or Grady Sizemore. Just my opinion.
GswnLKtQaa	LOL! predator because in the movies the predator owns the aliens.<br>  <br>  but basketball wise i'll take cassel.|`|3teWTOPqaa	I didn't watch the movie, but I believe Alien killed predator in that movie, and some girl killed the Alien.<br>  <br>  So to answer your Q, Sam Cassell aka the Alien should prevail in this case.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Ronnie Turiaf is not the predator.

83ebpB19aa	It's tough. Both teams are very young. The Warriors actually have a better record in the second half of the season, I think they're 5-2 or something like that, which means they can only get better. The Warriors also have a more in depth team, with they're bench including Corey Maggette, up and rising and maybe star Anthony Randolph and others. But don't get me wrong. Kevin Durant is great.|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	i like the thunder. you have to have alot of respect for kevin durant. he is putting up some impressive numbers for a player his age.|`|OmT2BzJPaa	Thunder with Westbrook, Durant,Green, maybe Thabeet/Dejuan Blair|`|IA4x5oPMaa	Raptors|`|fWMzd7y5aa	Thunder. <br>  They have Kevin Durant who is a pure scorer. Then they have Jeff Green who scores and rebound and is only going to get better. Russel Westbrook is a good Pg to have. If they get a good center they are going to be tough.|`|HiuNSScLaa	thunder IF they didnt trade away a draft pick they could have gotten thabeet thats what they need they would have been a playoff team if they kept it or tyson chandler|`|RYr6lgfVaa	thunder! they are already showing vast improvment|`|4428a349d91ccc84225a0c79844341a6aa	Neither team will make an impact next year.   Not until they get some good centers.|`|9b3e6104d0b9be6ae3be9f24af146307aa	Thunder. Durant, Green and Westbrook is the next triple punch of the nba.|`|k5TKF2rRaa	thunder because of k durant|`|xhHfXuKFaa	the thunder. kevin durant will only get better.|`|GswnLKtQaa	between the thunders and warriors i'll take the thunders.<br>  <br>  but the team that looks promising is the trailblazers.<br>  <br>  they are one of the youngest team in the nba yet they have one of the best records in the league. the core of the team is young roy, aldrige and oden. guys like fernandez, outlaw will also get better. Portland is the team of the future. imagine if their players were in their prime they would be contender.
k5sH7ryLaa	you need to take over dont be sacred if u wanna do something for your team step up be the hero|`|D6Llh23Baa	lebron james is a small forward who passes a lot.<br>  i think even if you play the point guard position in pickup games, shoot the ball on high-percentage shots. this would definitely develop your confidence in shooting the ball.<br>  never hesitate to attempt the open shot. who cares if you miss? at least, it's still a high-percentage shot.|`|83ebpB19aa	Drive to the basket more.

69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	First question:  Yes it is (even with quality defensive ammo like the 115 to 127 grain non+P type).  I like Federal non+P 124 grain Hydra Shok Personal Defense loads and this is what I buy for my daughter's Glock Model 26.  <br>  <br>  Which is better, Glock 26 or .38 Special?  I still favor the Glock for ammo capacity but a .38 Special is also a good home defense gun.  Is the .38 a better choice?  For some people who just prefer wheel-guns, or don't know a whole lot about guns and need something a little more user-friendly.  The .38 is just simpler:  Drop bullets in cylinder and squeeze the trigger.  If it doesn't go 'bang' simply squeeze the trigger again...  Again, is +P ammo a must for a .38?  If your revolver is rated for +P ammo (the Glocks are rated for even +P+) then sure.  But quality non+P 110 to 125 grain jacketed hollow-points work well especially with at least a 4" barrel.  So do Silvertip brand Winchester rounds as do any quality defensive rounds.  In both cases avoid ball or full metal jacket ammo for either one except for target practice.<br>  <br>  H|`|dpSr0icwaa	regular 9mm has a bit more power than 38 special +P, so 9mm +P a step above that.<br>  <br>  Plus, with the Glock 26 you have a lot more rounds available.<br>  <br>  Still, use the one YOU ARE MOST FAMILIAR WITH and the one YOU HIT THE TARGET MOST OFTEN WITH|`|dfBwVxXFaa	a 9mm without +p ammo is fine, it will still stop a man in his tracks, but I have to agree that a shotty is best for inside your home, but a 9mm would be good for concealed carry.|`|Vakup5Jvaa	The Glock 9mm is more than capable. And it has more rounds in case you miss......which in a low light situation is easy to do.|`|AA10200748	I would recommend the Glock 19 compact model instead, especially if you are not an experienced shooter. The 26 is a subcompact, and there is not much in the way of a grip, and recoil is accentuated by its smaller size.|`|Ucbnl7VJaa	I'd use both just as happily.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	9MM has plenty of power for defense......<br>  <br>  I see a lot of folks here that claim its anemic and not powerful enough -- Baloney!!!<br>  <br>  9MM  is plenty...... Others will suggest .357, .45 and others --- I say if you aren't knocking down doors in Kabul or rousting crackheads in a south Philly housing project you don't need a super power handgun cartridge.... <br>  <br>  9MM is fine......|`|yaq7oaH6aa	It is plenty.<br>  Are you a serious shooter for home defense.<br>  No gun is any use unless you are trained and in practice.<br>  If you can't hit the right target, right now, it's useless to you, <br>  and a hazard to others.

e5B5ITbhaa	Jr, Casey Mears, Paul Menard wont but Harvick and Kahne will.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	It is still too early to tell.   They should be able to bounce back.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Robby is his own boss, and the racer in him<br>  wants to kick butt, while the owner in him gives<br>  him a car that has no chance of winning, while <br>  staying within the budget..<br>  The others you mentioned will do just fine...<br>  They're all pro's... And very good racers..|`|DjjUe4MBaa	I sure hope so! Dale Jr needs to buckle down this year. No excuses! I mean, I'll still love him even if he never wins another race again (God forbid), but it would be a lot easier if he won some races every once in awhile.|`|Tt2pFEqFaa	menard won't.<br>  <br>  kasey finished 12th...that isn't too terrible considering the number of great drivers.|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Remember this, Jr finished 40th in this race last year, and we saw what he did for the next few months after that.|`|sn4zl0Riaa	I really believe that Kevin Harvick, Jeff Burton, Dale Jr., and Kasey Kahne will bounce back. Hendrick and Childress cars had trouble all around last night, so I hope it's just a fluke. Kevin has finished all but one race (last night's) in one piece, so I think he's the one most likely to bounce right back. As for Petty's cars, they've been having trouble with Kasey's car--it almost seemed--right after the Life Lock race last season (Dale Jr. won the race). I think Dale has had just a bad start to the season, but if we give it time, he might gain the momentum he needs to so that he can get in the Chase. As for Casey Mears, I'd have to say that he just needs to get accustomed to his new car & team; he just needs more time. Paul Menard...I don't think he will rebound because he's had nothing but bad luck right from the moment they stepped into Daytona.|`|auYtTrVoaa	The only thing that I know for sure is that Dale will rebound! He will do great in the next several races! You just wait and see! :)<br>  Maybe the other drivers that you mentioned will as well!<br>  <br>  Go Dale Jr.!!!<br>  Junior Nation!!!|`|RYr6lgfVaa	YES.

He has trouble there.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	....well , he'll be in the race running great until he see's he is doing good then he'll go to his customary mid-pack position.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	it depends on which way the wind is blowing.<br>  Qualifying doesn't matter that much unless you take the pole

4uSRVZNNaa	killer offense.  you must have made a trade already.  there is no way you could have drafted pujols AND wright.  did you trade your ace SP away for one of them?  <br>  you need pitching. actually your pitching won't be that bad if verlander and harang bounce back this year.  that's a big if.  none are bonafide studs. this is a cross your fingers rotation.  you only have one proven closer but their jobs are in so much flux during the season that if you pay attention you can pick up a FA closer and be okay.<br>  I give it a 7 because of pitching. you lack a stud starter.|`|rvyvF3KAaa	I would give your team a 7.5. You have great hitters, you just need better pitching.|`|BKg7030Iaa	How did you end up with Pujols and Wright on your team? That's really quite a coup. I agree with the others -- great hitting, so-so pitching. You might be  a little weak on stolen bases too.  But overall, a very good team. Have fun. Pray for good health of Pujols and Wright!|`|azxbIaVfaa	out of a scale of 10 i would rate it a 7-8 and 1/2|`|tEwZWXstaa	8.5/10 man this is cool<br>  <br>  no probs. but i rahter another pitchers should be there but its oki...ima put this team when i buy MLB 09 The Show|`|k5TKF2rRaa	7

c17x6L4baa	ONE team per state( like your title sentence) might be a tolerable burden on the people who would have to support the monetary losses once the economy recovers.  It would not be profitable in a lot of states.<br>  <br>  Seven states have populations under one million.  That is not a real large METRO AREA for A team.  TWO teams would have to draw enough paid attendance to be profitable with this as a total STATE population, or, the teams would require yearly state tax-payer bail-outs. That would not be popular among people losing their homes, or, struggling not to. <br>  <br>  There just are not a lot of mega-rich stupid enough to think that investment in the huge cost of starting an NFL franchise in a lot of states would be a good idea, no matter if the economy was in a down-turn or not.  Unless you want that cost on the tax-payers too.  That would not be popular among people losing their homes, or, struggling not to.|`|GZpwkL1Vaa	no. the NFL wants the games to always be close, because this increases veiver there for gaining more money. teams in smaller states such as rhode island or alaska (smaller population wise) would not have the income other big city teams would have and couldnt afford to pay 75 millions in player saleries, so they would absolutly suck ***|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Not a chance.  Not even close.<br>  <br>  1) While 2 teams in every state would definitely mean jobs, how would these teams be able to afford to pay all the workers if they aren't drawing a good enough crowd.  Football stadiums are packed because there are only 32 of them in the country.  Add 68+ (some states already have more than 2 teams) teams, and you will not sell out the stadiums.<br>  <br>  2) Where would support for these teams come from.  I live in CT and I'm a Falcons fan.  Most people here in CT are Patriots, Giants and Jets fans with your occasional Steelers, Eagles, Raiders, Cowboys, and Dolphins fans.  If CT were to have 2 teams, I would not become a fan of either, nor would most real football fans here.  We already have our favorite teams and most of us are real fans.  Some Pats fans may switch because we'd now have a home team, but you're talking 2 new teams, so the few fans that would support the new state team will be spilt.  This will happen in all states.<br>  <br>  3) With 100+ players, you'll have extremely watered down talent.  Good competition as we know it would be gone.  Salaries of the truly great players would go up, since they would be in higher demand, but not every team would even have a star.  Total busts like Ryan Leaf would still have starting jobs.  Players who you've never heard of in the NFL, Erik Ainge, Alex Brink, Kevin Kolb, Kellen Clemens, would all be starting QBs.  The NFL would be a joke.<br>  <br>  4) Most of the games would essentially be the equivalent of minor league baseball, a game you go to but don't really care about, just for the hell of it.  I'd go to a game if I had nothing to do, or if the Falcons were in town, but thats about it.  The bad thing is that with NFL ticket prices, chances are I'd not really want to go to games for the hell of it since they aren't as cheap as minor league baseball.<br>  <br>  5) With a 16 game season (you can't get much longer) how would a playoff system work with 100+ teams.  Let the top 32 or 64 in?  You'd be looking at the Super Bowl in March with as long as that would take.  <br>  <br>  Overall, I understand where you're coming from, but theres no way.  I don't want the NFL to turn into minor league baseball.  As it is now the NFL is the most competitive league in sports, and I'm sure all true football fans want to see it that way, and not just some joke of a sport.|`|HOYuWR4gaa	why the **** should alaska have 2 teams in them... why should new hampishire, vermont have 2 teams, do no no how much money that would cost, this is a terrible ideal i could see A team in every state but 2 dude your crazy, who gonna fiance this???????|`|tOIhNyCJaa	They need a team in North Korea they could attach nuclear weapons to all of their players and they could litterally blow out teams if you know what I mean|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Not with this Economy|`|22f82d8d45e6cb20bd3007cf1b7900f2aa	No because it costs billions of dollars to get an NFL team and stadium built.

6bV4s2cgaa	This isn't the right year this game actually happened in 1986-1987 <br>  AFC Championship was between the Clevland Browns and the Denver Broncos. When John Elway took the Broncos 98 yards to tie the game up and then in overtime Rich Karlis made the game winning FG. The Fumble took place a year later against the same teams. This time Clevland was about to score the game winning touchdown but Earnest Byner fumbled the ball at the 3 yard line sending the Broncos to 2 Super Bowls.
qyATAaeXaa	It's my opinion that that snowboarders who try skiing find it easier because they have already mastered balance. Having said that, I think BOTH sports can get boring if all you do is ride up a lift and go straight down the hill, (rinse and repeat.) If you are dedicated to either (or both) sports, there is always something else to progress to. <br>  <br>  There is no question that freestyle skiers have more variety of tricks than snowboarders do. I'm not saying that snowboarding tricks are easier, but with both feet strapped to a single board, snowboarders are challenged to really do more than grabs, flips, and rotations. <br>  <br>  When it comes to general skiing and riding, the challenge is up to you to find. I've been skiing for over 20 years and I still find stuff to challenge myself. Skiing or riding a black diamond means absolutely nothing. Any moron can make it down a "Most Difficult" slope. It does not mean you rode it well. And where was this Black Diamond slope? I'm a really s#!tty snowboard rider, but even I can make it down a black slope at a Pocono resort. <br>  <br>  If you can run a FIS certified Downhill or GS course on skis after one day, freakin' GREAT! You are the best skier in the world! Join the olympic team. <br>  <br>  Were those Telemark skis? Try that and tell me if it easier or more boring than snowboarding. <br>  <br>  Frankly, I don't give a rip anymore if someone is a rider or skier. There's more than enough mountain for all of us and do what you like to do. If you think skiing is boring, that's your bag to carry. Not anyone else's. What should it matter? I freaking hate snowboarding, but I'm not going to sit around and ponder why I dislike it or if I should give it another try.|`|JThgHiaoaa	I like snowboarding but I haven't been skiing. Generally, the people I know who like skiing better have all been people who either couldn't snowboard very well or could do both but were tons better with skis because it was easier and they wanted to go on the harder runs.|`|9f0eb3ac244a30553e7164baead93341aa	snowboarding better.!!!!!!! its more fun and it helps lossen you up sorta|`|mSlQHmQ7aa	i think snowboarding is better i skied till i was 9 and i was really good (4 my age) for ex. i could do rails 180s boxes grabs..tons of things.. then i tried snowboarding and i got hooked im only twelve but i loved it soooo much that i just went as much as possible and now i am better than i was at skiing better tricks and ten times faster|`|LGCTOxZxaa	Yes, skiing is WAY easier, hence 3 year olds ski instead of board. I switched at age 6 and been boarding for 10 years now, and wouldnt even think about switching back. Sure i could do it, but why? Snowboarding is so much more of a challenge! And as a lady i get lots of respect for kicking guys asses when i board :P its fab!<br>  <br>  GO BOARDERS!|`|yeYL8Udoaa	skateboarding is hard to learn but once you get the hang of it you can learn tricks easier...<br>  <br>  i havnt gone skiing...|`|WDUeJCH1aa	Skiing can quickly become boring on small hills. I snowboard on our local hill because its more challenging, but on the real mountains skiing is definitely every bit as exciting (not to mention less painful!!!) as snowboarding.|`|5fHG6e4Uaa	my personal opinion is snowboarding
UHTcpdkVaa	You would be surprised - after watching an Aikido demonstration - how brutal the techniques really are.  Aikidoka know how the fall will work, and know when to give up and just go with it - normal people don't really know how to do that.  When normal people take a fall, they get hurt.  When normal people take a fall on concrete, they get hurt badly.<br>  <br>  One guy in my school had to use a simple ikkyo against a gangbanger who had picked him out for his initiation into the gang.  The guy from my school did a perfect ikkyo, which face planted the gangsta into the asphalt.  The gangsta ended up with 8 missing teeth, a split lower jaw, and a broken nose.  You don't typically get up from that - this guy didn't either.  He ended up in ICU for a few days.  Luckily, the investigators showed that our guy acted reasonably and was not charged with any crime.<br>  <br>  Now, that's not the goal of any aikidoka, but as with any fight, sometimes you pull out a perfect move that does more damage than you expect.  In that particular situation, no one felt particularly bad about it - but there are other instances that damage has been done that was not warranted simply due to the aikidoka expecting the attacker to fall like students do in class.  Which they don't.<br>  <br>  There are numerous instances of techniques like kube shimi being used against a person who doesn't know to keep their chin down as they take the fall - so their head dribbles on the ground knocking them out soundly.  Similar techniques (from uke's perspective at least) like shiho nage and irimi nage have been known to cause brain hemorrhaging and deaths (and that's occasionally among students on a mat).<br>  <br>  That said, it is entirely possible that you'll throw someone who knows how to fall and will get back up.  That's why in my school we teach 2 things to combat this...  #1 - don't admire your handiwork (when you throw someone, don't watch to see how pretty it looks, be aware of what else is going on)  #2 - run.  By the time he gets back up, I hope to be out of sight.<br>  <br>  There are different types of fights of course... many where beating the snot out of a person is really not called for.  This is where Aikido really excels over other arts that don't necessarily have methods to do this.  There is a reason that we have a lot of cops and bouncers in our school, who use the techniques daily.<br>  <br>  Ikkyo is a technique that my uncle used to bounce a 70 year old drunk guy from a bar - and did it without injuring or hurting him.  It's the availability to use one technique against different situations that I find very useful.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	If you've practiced it for 10-20 years and you're very good at it.<br>  <br>  If you think being violently slammed into the ground while having your wrist simultaneously destroyed is effective, then yes Aikido works in a real fight.|`|M0qoqvJbaa	You're going to find people who will back it up.  Doesn't mean there aren't better solutions for actually learning how to defend yourself.  I would advise looking elsewhere for those, pretty much anywhere would be a good start.|`|b74d692feeebce552bcfcdfcb6a76acdaa	in close hand to hand combat, i am a prison guard and its very handy in submission holds and self defence.|`|444cc0a50021891de69824c19550f54daa	aikido is a very useful art if you master it<br>  it takes years to really master the art to a level where it becomes really useful but at a high level i've found it one of the most effective tools for self defense.  the main principle of aikido is still the soundest one in a self defense situation as far as I am concerned.  whatever comes at you get out of it's way and handle the threat from a safe angle.  whatever you do from there on...<br>  as with most martial arts you have do be able to distinguish what you are taught in class and what is really possible streetwise.   the techniques that are taught in class are meant to stress the opponent but you must take in mind that they were derived from samurai ju jitsu where they were used as techniques to break bones and dislocate joints or even kill the opponent.  afther a while training you get a pretty good feel of how it should be done if need be.<br>  as to throwing the opponent again the same thing applies you can over do the joint locks to injure the opponent of if you really throw him to the ground believe me that he's not going to be willing to get back up with a soar back|`|onkUcy19aa	Yes, aikido is very useful in a real fight. But it would take you years to rreally learn it and be proficient to use it in a real fight.

Next season is going to be HUGE. A lot good free agents all over the place. New York is looking to boost their squad with some of those free agents. Personally i am pushing for them to get some big names. With the Lakers and Celtics at full blast. The Knicks would make for a good opponent in the East if they get a championship team in one year which is possible. Knick fans can only wait. It will be interesting to see what happens this summer.

5X0p45Zbaa	Zinedine Zidane and Lionel Messi<br>  <br>  i loved football since i was 5 and now im 13 and i love soccer! alot and i do my best!<br>  <br>  I first seen football when i was about 3.5 years old i was playing with my older sis and bro and she was 8 i think and now shes 21 and my bro is 19!<br>  <br>  And Zinedine Zidane is my favorite because i seen his play alot i like how he played and i play same position as him and hes the greatest player i ever seen! <br>  <br>  Lionel Messi is also one of my favorite because hes one of the youngest player and im a fan of Barca!!! and hes just like Maradona|`|IWM1khX7aa	Ronaldinho.  He was so skilled and talented.  I love watching him at Barca and he was the best player in FIFA 07 and FIFA 08. <br>  <br>  I played it when I was like 7 years old but ther were no teams to follow because I didn't know what Manchester United or Barcelona was.  I live in America and never used the internet.  I started to like it again when I read an article about the 2006 FIFA World Cup and saw some of the cool jersies (kits) and players.  <br>  <br>  I first saw it when I was like 5 or 6 and I wanted to play it.|`|frA6KJwIaa	when the whole thing about david beckham coming to america started, i started to pay attention and saw some games before he arrived. i fell in love with the game and the adrenaline rush feeling you get when the team you are rooting for scores a goal! i was 13. so i owe it all to beckham, he is my first favorite, but now i also love cristiano ronaldo. his dribbling, skills, and goals are all amazing. <br>  <br>  that's my history with soccer! and i am proof of beckham's change in america with a new standard of soccer...so it must have worked with a few more people... :)|`|FFE9Qztzaa	steven gerrard and alessandro del piero<br>  Since I was about 7 yrs of age<br>  See?

d421880a728f84177e7dc50d9e60e631aa	As much as it sucks, right now I honestly don't ever see RCR reaching the same level of dominance of Roush and Hendrick. Ever since they lost Dale that organization just hasn't been the same. They have shown signs of life, like back in 2006, but never anything consistent. <br>  <br>  They have couple very talented drivers that, given the right resources and equipment, could go out and dominate. But unfortunately that equipment doesn't seem to be there right now.<br>  <br>  Hopefully today was just a crap day for them and not a foretelling of the rest of the season. But I'm still not holding my breath.|`|jXgKtDe0aa	I think that RCR will be better and a contered in like 4 to 5 years. When they stop making engines with EGR that always blow up. But i think all Clint Bowyer, Kevin Harvick and Jeff Burton will make chase and Casey Mears wont just cause it is his first year. No EGR Drivers will make it. Only one will come close Juan Pablo Montoya.|`|5FgfNndWaa	yes i think its just that casey mears is new and no testing thats why they stuggled same with yates racing after they let go of dale jarret it was all down hill as for rcr i think its the no testing and casey mears being new|`|Crzpl2fiaa	no thay will not|`|1r05fktRaa	no there had there days|`|a4LWildhaa	I doubt it.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	I'm not sure that RCR has ever been what I would call dominant, at least not as an organization.  Sure, Dale Earnhardt Sr. was a dominant driver but he is the only one to ever win a championship for Richard at the cup level.  Jack Roush, Joe Gibbs and Rick Hendrick have been the dominant owners with championships from different drivers along the way.  I don't think Richard is ever going to get to the level of consistency that those 3 organizations are at, just my opinion.  I don't have anything against him, I respect and even like Mr. Childress.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|21cf85dc961b3d03a8c5bb2f231c50aaaa	They are a mid pack team that will win mainly by luck not power or skill. Roush and Hendrick are the 2 super powers and will take a lot to beat thoes teams. I like all the RCR guys but they fall just short of what it takes to be a championship team. If It were me I would switch car manufacture to Ford or Toyota because I believe chevy is doomed.|`|IRbkrJUWaa	ae.. you've just contradicted yourself..<br>  <br>  Hendrick, which BTW is the leading team as of the last 3 years, is a car make of CHEVY..<br>  <br>  Childress just doesn't have the smarts... the equipment, the people, and maybe, just maybe the drivers.. to make something happen.. to win championships..|`|YIWKPXokaa	They hired Mears as their 4th driver.

Watch your calorie and carbohydrate intake and do lots of cardiovascular exercises.|`|TnTXGNyMaa	this is what all pro fighters do, you need to start eating fruits drinking alot of water and sweating alot!, pro fighters will loose up to 10-15 lb in a week before the fight. Get on a treadmill wear a sweat suit, plastic bags work like garbage hefty bags and run run run before weigh in, most fighters loose about 5 puonds of water weight and then after the weigh ins they get the water weight back. i suggest you start earlier though run loose alot of water weight and eat alot of vegetables, also dont eat as much as you usually do, instead of a meal, drink a very nutritious protein shake, do things like this.|`|1NVMAxgUaa	what i think you should do and its workout out great for me is i will not eat for about a day or 2 and i will have nothing but water/juice/supplements and after that your stomach has shrank enough and it will be alot easier to resist those bad fatty foods for you. then currently what i do is drink a ton of water take all of my supplements and then have a fruit or nuts every 2 hours or so. also while you run or do whatever cardio excercise that you do just wear alot of sweats ex: sweat shirt sweat pants beanie long socks. it helps to burn more fat and lose more water weight. also try to drink more grean tea cause it helps to burn more fat. also one more thing dont go on that water diet for to long because it could do damage to you and get alot of negative effects|`|zJC18FtAaa	Jump rope do it for an hour you can burn 1,000 calories and its great cardio, works lower and upper body muscles, improves agility as well

The Sig has the same basic problem as the 9mm+P, it wastes too much of it's energy on the landscape, i.e. it goes straight through.|`|69a47001c8449771a6964bf1c2360497aa	On paper the .357 Sig is more powerful than the .45 acp.  The .357 Sig has not been involved in enough real-life shootings to provide a valid response.  In the meantime we do know this, the .45 acp is the second-best manstopper yet.  The .357 Magnum is still #1 and the .357 Sig was developed to duplicate the performance of the .357 Mag. out of an auto-loader rather than a revolver.  Has it?  Again, on paper it comes very close.  <br>  <br>  Real world events:  More and more police agencies (such as Texas DPS) have gone to the faster-moving .357 Sig rather than the slow, heavy wide .45 acp.  Why?  The .357 Sig just performs better against barriers such as doors, sheetmetal and car glass than the .45 acp.  In this department the .45 acp is just a poor-performer.<br>  <br>  Pros of .357 Sig:  Faster, better penetrator, decent stopper (perhaps as good as the .357 Mag?) and pistols chambered for this round hold more ammo than pistols chambered for .45 acp.<br>  <br>  Pros of .45 acp:  Proven manstopper from the days when the bad guys didn't wear body-armor and made their getaways on horseback rather than iron horses.  <br>  <br>  Cons of .357 Sig:  This round is LOUD, even loader than most .357 Mag rounds so pistols chambered in this round may be a little harder to master due to the bang and flash.<br>  <br>  Cons of .45 acp:  Old technology to-wit: fat, slow-moving heavy slug that depends on girth to stop, which is great against 2-legged targets and not so great against 4-wheel targets and barriers; pistols chambered for .45 acp hold less ammo than those chambered for the more modern .357 Sig.  <br>  <br>  My personal favorite?  Nether one of these.  Make mine the 10mm which is the best of both worlds:  Rapid velocity, relatively heavy slug and wider bore than the 9mm or .357 Mag.  My Glock Model 20 holds 15+1 rounds which is more ammo than a .45 or .357 Mag. and as many rounds as my Glock Model 31 .357 Sig.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helped.<br>  <br>  H|`|dpSr0icwaa	45 acp +P outperforms 357 SIG (which is loaded to +P pressures as 'standard')|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	.357 SIG but the .45 ACP is a lot easier to get|`|StDPJ7bXaa	would you rather get hit with a baseball at 90 mph or a bowling ball at 40 mph ?

This also put added pressure on a lot of their higher profile players which in turn made everything they did a media circus.<br>  <br>  3) Over Penalized (most penalized team in the League) at the Ame time the Officials called alot of bogus Penalties against them, yet they also Missed Calls that would have helped them that were legitimate and obvious.<br>  <br>  4) 9-7 is nothing to be ashamed of, and any time you put a team or a person on a pedestal that when they do meet expectations the failure looks worse than for a team or individual that had moderate or lower expectations lest say the Lions or even Cardinals whom suprised alot of people, yet they went to the superbowl, and lost yet the expecations that the media had of Dallas to go to the Superbowl made the their failure seem so much worse than getting there and losing the way the Cardinals did.   <br>  <br>  5) Fans want a 19-0 season of their team, who wouldn't? Yet what's realistic? For Dallas, for all their injuries, was 9-7 so bad? It's still a winninig season, as many good games as they had, none of the were pretty wins, not a single one, if anything they were ugly and 6 of those 9 wins were too close for comfort, but they were still wins.

They have more potential than any other team and are close to putting it all together and when they do there won't be a team that can hang with them, remember this team was beating the Steelers on the road for 3 and a half quarters until they beat themselves and gave the game away.

Another thing working in Blue Jays' favor is that, with the Rays no longer flying under anybody's radar, the Blue Jays can become that "surprise" team in '09.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, I have to put my hopes in the injury imp and the baseball karma gods and hope that this is one year neither one lets me down.|`|AA11720887	Steinbrenners wasted money again this season.

eOxEciIHaa	Depends on how old you are and how good of a ball player you are. If you are a good ball player look at the Georgia Stars or the Atlanta Celtics. If you are an okay basktball player then look at the Atlanta Aftershock or Georgia Flight. If you suck then dont bother playing AAU. It is expensive for your parents and if you suck it would be a waste of time and money.

Y1grCXHQaa	first to get your flexibility back you just need to practice. Stretch three times a day. <br>  to stay fit just do some squats, lunges, sit-ups, pushups etc. make sure you keep up the intensity and you can add weights on too. also if u sprint up and down stairs that also helps. <br>  if u have time you can also go to outdoor rinks or public skating. <br>  <br>  hope that helps and i hope your parents get better soon :)|`|uKyfRzxIaa	This probably won't help much but stretch everyday for 45 minutes for flexibility and start ice skating again ASAP. I;m not sure about what to do about the triples but you should be able to get those back pretty fast if you had them. Don't do competitions for a little while so you can get back in shape. Good luck!! :)
EmYNUZcXaa	when i was a JR i trained off and on ice and took ballet every single day. if you can't get cardio workout by skating then i suggest running on a treadmil or something. you can get out of shape for skating quickly if you dont get cardio all the time. if you have a program, run through it off ice 10 times a day. stretch, stretch, stretch. and always keep your muscles warm. practice your laybacks using a ballet bar. also lying on your stomach, push up with your hands and pull your head back as far as you can go and try to bring your legs up behind you and touch your head to your toes. that will help with your flexibility for your layback. for your triple loops and double sals i'd work on squats. because you need really strong thigh muscles for those. good luck to you hun, you'll get it all back. it really is like riding a bike.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	if i were u i would do some ballet, or hook up a ballet bar in your room, and practice stretching there, when i did that it really helped me with my spirals, illusions, charlottes, and biellmanns, so just keep stretching, and for your triples just remember to keep your back arched and your posture up<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|acmsrOulaa	triple loops and double saws WAT?

Still touch base with the coach during the day.<br>  <br>  If you do make practice - mentor those team mates filling your position.<br>  - just like a junior coach. This shows the coaches your dedication, leadership capacity, and your desire. <br>  It will also show them how well you understand your position(s)<br>  Note: this doesn't mean drop crutches and hit someone...talk them through it.<br>  <br>  If you attend practice, go to the games.<br>  <br>  Keeping Defensive stats, helping the coaching staff scout games, and doing administrative functions makes you valuable even through your injury AND you will learn much much more about the sport.<br>  <br>  Take the season to heal the knee.<br>  Go through rehab and make it stronger.<br>  Come back next year and fight like hell to make your place on the team.<br>  <br>  I wish you healthy, positive, and determined to have a great time.<br>  <br>  I played through 5 years of college with bad knees.<br>  Later found out had torn acls in both.<br>  Healing first and staying connected was the very best thing for me.<br>  You will earn respect by being part of the team and not quitting|`|TuOp3hNPaa	keep playing...no regrets|`|uU9aCPB4aa	maybe you should quit if you feel like you lost the respect of your teamates and your knee is feeling bad it might be a good idea. But if you havent already you should tell the coach about your knee. If he is a good coach he will hear you out and respect you again, but you would still have to rehab your knee and fully heal for the season. Good luck man.|`|uU15o7Mbaa	dude stay in the sport you'll miss it once it's over like you i played with a dislocated knee and yes i was 2 way starter just because the coach pulled you out of practice doesn't mean he gave up on you just keep working hard at it and you'll get back up to the starting position|`|0Fi9EANKaa	no one on this site can decide for you better than you can.

NO DEDICATION|`|5cPKYEVAaa	Keep playing<br>  <br>  you have to earn your way and id go to like a place where u can strengthen your knee and stuff|`|xpR64O9Maa	Is this Westlake High School in Austin, Texas?|`|lCR8d2hraa	I am currently facing the same decision, I am a defensive back in college, however I tore the latimus dorsi muscle in my back and I am trying to decide to keep rehabbing for next season or hanging up my cleats. I am going to try and go, rehab as much as possible and let my body tell me what I do. If it may hurt my body down the line then I am going to retire, with you have a dislocated knee, it should get better if you exercise it enough. That pain is gain as you have to restrengthen it to make it better and tougher and to prevent further injuries. Basically it comes down to being honest with yourself, do you want to play college ball? Are you good enough for college ball? If you doubt either of those even for just a second you need to think of your long term health. Just listen to your body, it never lies. Hope this helps man
PxtmMAMnaa	it depends how old you are. you seem really skinny, but if you are one of the tallest people on your team you will be a backspot. im shorter and weigh 120 and im a flyer.. i weight 100 when i started though.<br>  <br>  first off, take a tumbling class and build up the strength to at least do a backhandspring with a spot. practice cartwheels on your own and make sure to point your toes and finish with your head and chest up. these little details will make a difference!<br>  <br>  for splits, stretch every day. make sure not to overstretch! stretching after a hot shower is good because when your muscles are warm they are more flexible. same with scorpion. look on youtube to learn ways to pull it and stretch it by doing bridges and pulling it. if you cant get it all the way, tie a scarf or something like that around your ankle, and pull that up into a scorpion. then pull the scarf so your foot gets closer to you.<br>  <br>  for toe touch, make sure to stretch in a straddle left right and center. practice jumping everyday to build muscle. make sure to keep your head and chest up, arms parallel to the ground, and toes pointed.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|8mSXZD6qaa	the hieght is a bit tall but i lift a 5"7 girl and its difficult but i am trying. and guess what i am doing great to.<br>  just hope your base is tough and can get you up there
MRIiOgbZaa	Stretch your calves before and after track practice.  It sounds like you have either cramping or muscle fatigue, both of which are fairly common.  For some stretching exercises, go to <a href="http://physicaltherapy.about.com/od/flexibilityexercises/a/calfstretch.htm" rel="nofollow">http://physicaltherapy.about.com/od/flex...</a><br>  <br>  To address the cramping side, you might need dietary supplements such as calcium, potassium and magnesium, all of which help fuel the body when running.  Go to a health food store for supplements like these.  Drinking milk isn't usually enough for me.|`|yukvVPRhaa	if it's like a cramping pain try eating some pickles they help a lot

1UID5JtNaa	check the link for results from a Dec meet.  they are all listed as unattached so not sure if they were on the team or not.  800 times are slow- 2:20s- 3:00.   I would say you need to certainly be under 2:30 to be competitive, but keep in mind many girls run in the 2:10-2:15 range.  Long Beach had one athlete run 17:20s for 5K indoors.

83ebpB19aa	He's not an elite guard yet, but he will get there. His strength is offense, and on defense he could do a little better but he's a guard, so it's not that important. He's also a great clutch shooter. Kinda like Kevin Durant in that way.

MRIiOgbZaa	Set up a training regimen based on your physical shape.  Ask yourself whether you're healthy enough to run (do you have asthma, heart trouble, or do you have chronic injuries like a re-spraining ankle or knee or something?).  If you think you can run healthily, check your diet.  Do you eat a lot of fatty, sugary or otherwise unhealthy foods?  This can affect endurance more than you think.  I also recommend that if you haven't had a check up at the doctor's in over a year you get one, especially if you've never done any type of work out besides recreational basketball.  *NOTE*: unless you are a very fit person to begin with, I highly recommend you only run every other day, as you have an increased chance of hurting yourself by over-exercising.  I also find stretching the leg and calf muscles before running helps, but do whatever works for you.<br>  Okay, so let's say now you're a pretty healthy person.  To start, make sure you have good running form, which includes a fairly straight back, good stride (no shuffling feet) and good use of arms (don't let them hang at your sides).  Depending on the weather, get appropriate clothing on for where you're running.  Get specific shoes just for running because if you run every day, one pair of shoes will wear out very fast if you use them for anything other than running/jogging.  Wear sweats or a long sleeve t-shirt, or if you live in a warmer area wear t-shirt and shorts or even a sleeveless shirt.  Running with a heavy coat isn't usually a good idea because you can overheat.<br>  Now for the program: Bring a watch or other means of keeping time.  Basically try to run/jog as long as you can, and if you have a way to keep track of how far you run (such as a track or field at school), use that when possible.  If full on running or even fast jogging is too much for you, try running for 5-10 minutes and then walking for 2-5 minutes, running, walking.  This will quickly build up your endurance.<br>  In essence, whatever you think you're capable of and put your mind to, you can achieve with the right diet and proper training routine.  You'd be surprised how much endurance you can gain with these two things.  In a few weeks you should notice major improvements in your stamina.  Good luck with your endurance training, I hope I helped :D|`|1UID5JtNaa	Endurance running and basketball are quite different.  Too much running will have a negative impact on your quickness and vertical jumping ability.  I would suggest setting up a training program that is specific to basketball if that is your priority- plyometrics, jumping, sprinting (I believe they are called gassers), strength, agility drills mixed in with base endurance training. Your sprint speed should also increase.   You can't do this type of training every day- 2-3 days a week with actual play inbetween.

FSSU21cyaa	during the swimming, put your head down and take long, stretched out strokes while kicking your legs. that should make your stroke more efficient. for the treading part, i would recommend the egg beater with sculling arms. it's a little hard to explain but i'll give it a go: assume a sitting position like you're sitting in a chair, and move your legs in a circular motion from the knee going inward. your legs should be moving in opposite directions. with your arms, move them in a horizontal fashion. bring them forward with your thumbs up and palms forward and then bring them back with your thumbs facing down and repeat. here's an ok video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXk-ZRlHBPk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXk-ZRlHB...</a>|`|uAzToWC7aa	for treading, just do the frog kick because it doesnt take up that much energy as just kicking up and down. and for swimming, if you dont get timed, go kinda easily and slow to save up ur energy, <br>  <br>  I really hope taht you pass that test, so good luck!

LGVrhTFTaa	I've won 4 of 6 fantasy baseball leagues with a simple formula.<br>  <br>  Look for a shortstop,3rd baseman,outfielder,1st baseman,and a 2nd baseman in the 1st 5 rounds..(NO PITCHERS)<br>   If you don't get Han Ram,Rollins,or Reyes in the 1st couple rounds, grab Alexie Ramirez in round 4..And if you don't get M.Cabrera,A.Rod,<br>  D.Wright,or E.Longoria in the 1st 2 rounds,target Chris Davis in the 5th round..And when you are picking these players,focus on players with speed+power.(HanRam,Sizemore,C.Beltran,o... maybe in round 4,C.Granderson (If you already have a SS.)..Then beyond round 5 it's up to you if you want a kick*** offence,or a balanced team of pitching,<br>  and hitting.I suggest taking your 1st starting pitcher in round 8 (Like Ervin Santana).Then go closer,SP(Starting Pitcher),closer,SP,all the way to round 13,where I'd take the best available catcher (like Benjie Molina,or C.Iannetta).Then go with more closers+SPs until round 17,where I'd take Willy Taveras(Who lead the NL in stolen bases.),<br>  and/or Delmon Young; who at the age of 23,has 30 homerun+30 stolen base potential. Hopefully this will complete your offence.With<br>  only 0,or 1 on your offencive bench (That's ALL you need.)<br>  Finish your draft with more closers,like Trevor Hoffman,and SPs,like <br>  Manny Para,Wandy Rodriguez,and Andy Pettite..  <br>   BTW-These rounds are predicted for a 12 team league..You'll have to adjust up,or down for different sized leagues.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Powerful/speedy offences+LOTS of SPs+closers,win fantasy baseball leagues.<br>  <br>  ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|c9PHwfVMaa	Fill out the shallowest positions first if you can. Of course, in the first round, go after a top rank player. After that, it's pretty much your choice, but I'd think about filling out empty positions before drafting depth to your filled positions. Players like Hanley, Jose Reyes, Jimmy Rollins are superstars who play in a position with little talent. It'd be smart to acquire those guys quickly. As for 1B or 3B, there's a ton of depth there, so take your time. For pitchers, you don't really need aces, but people like Cliff Lee last till the 9th round sometimes. Don't go after Johan Santana or Cole Hamels; go after Lackey, Kazmir, and those lesser-known pitchers instead of the BIGGER names. For closers there's always a diversity, so take your time. Just remember: batters first, SPs, then closers.|`|BKg7030Iaa	Draft as many home run hitters as possible in the early rounds. Look for pitching and speed in the middle rounds. Be sure to get at least 2 good closers in the middle rounds, rounds 6-8. They go fast this year and will bring your stats down in your league if you don't have a couple of quality closers. <br>  <br>  There's lots of draft guides on the Internet, many of them free, that can give you more details on strategy. <br>  <br>  Probably the best practical tip is to do some practice drafting at one of the mock draft sites -- Yahoo has this feature now. So does CBS Sportsline. The big daddy of them all is Mock Draft Central. If you  haven't tried one of these practice sites yet, you're really missing a great opportunity to get your feet wet and see how your ideas translate into a real draft environment.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Cu5GB2wfaa	I would'nt draft a pitcher until the 6th round, at the earliest.  There are plenty of good pitchers that will be around still, later in the draft.  Get a good infield.  Just try and round out a team with a few good sluggers, and a few guys who can steal bases.  If you can get a slugger who steals bases that is a plus.  Also, hold on the closers also.  I take my closers as late as possible, I go after the bottom of the barrel guys who still put up saves, and not waste early draft picks to get a Papelbon or Nathan.  Guys like Matt Capps, Trevor Hoffman, Brandon Lyon, Joel Hanrahan, Brian Fuentes, Frank Fransico, etc will fill the saves position just fine, enough to compete.
7x4VtGtFaa	I've never been convinced that Rafa is the man to lead Liverpool to premier league glory. He just doesn't get it.|`|mK06dus9aa	I don't subscribe to the Rafa is rubbish view. I think the issue with Liverpool concerns the lack of quality in depth of the squad. There are too many players that are goodish and not enough that are great.|`|Rds4eGIyaa	I'm not convinced that he will but I'm not convinced that he won't either. The thing is with Rafa he has built a squad capable of mounting a title challenge. <br>  <br>  There are no doubts he has made progress with our league form over the past few years and while it is disappointing that it appears we will not win the title, second place is certainly progress. With Torres, Alonso, Mascherano, Gerrard, Kuyt, Carragher, Agger, Reina we have a spine to build around. Add some quality full backs, a wide man and a striker then we will have a great shot. Another summer of Keane's and Dossena's and we may go backwards. <br>  <br>  Rafa's at a crossroads. But what's the alternative? Mourinho will remain at Inter, Rijkaard had some success at Barca before going **** up and while he produced sexy football its useless if you have no clue about defending, Klinsmann ain't good enough.......|`|qZWko07Kaa	its very possible they have a good squad.

He has the money to bring in top-class superstars, but spends them on players like Aurelio, Dosena, Arbeloa, Riera, N'gog. They also don't have strength in depth, so I have no idea why his line up changes so much. If Liverpool are without three players (Steven Gerrard, Jamie Carragher, Fernando Torres) they will become a team Challenging to even qualify for the Ueafa Cup. <br>  On the other hand Man Utd, Chelsea, Arsenal and even Villa have a lot of strength in depth.|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	I cannot see how Liverpool will ever win the title with Benitez in charge. I do not think he is up to managing a team at the highest level for the whole season without having too many set backs. I believe his tactics and team selection at times leave a lot to be desired and I do not think he is that clever in the transfer market.|`|AA11983600	No chance, that your friend is right

obPSaYf3aa	It's not a matter of being "smart", but rather having a close knit group of friends that are loyal to you and would never stab you in the back under any circumstance.  <br>  <br>  Since "money talks", and because Barry's trial is just two weeks from now, if Barry completes the trial without a conviction and Greg Anderson also does not have to testify under subpoena, maybe Greg will turn on Barry at that time just to receive payment for "the Story", and will jeopardize the friendship by talking to the media because Barry cannot be tried twice for anything due to double jeopardy.<br>  <br>  At that time, the friendship will end and although no more legal action can be done against Barry, Greg will become rich and Barry's life outside of baseball will sink lower because of public opinion when the full story comes out.  It's just my opinion of what may happen after the trial.|`|FZRWMc3Baa	If he were the smartest, he'd be in Spring Training right now.  And he would have played last year.

1wME8TCraa	Well, I think it's a combination of two things.<br>  <br>  He's mainly a shooter and even the greatest of shooters go through slumps. Look at J.J. Redick. Secondly, when you're a bench player, you don't have much time on the floor to get out of a funk and start hitting your shots, especially when you're pretty much one dimensional as Sasha Vujacic. <br>  <br>  But don't worry, he'll snap out of it soon and be the Machine again.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	he must recharge his batteries.|`|vG0Ni0qDaa	he played less too, he's just off now...but when he gets back his touch the machine will be back.|`|ZKtvJ8INaa	I agree with Zach, he's just on a slump...he's be a machine again.|`|Lpv6UY7Iaa	He's just in a slump, but he'll snap out of it pretty soon and will hit thoose 3's when it counts!|`|9mtMw9Qaaa	He needs a new pack of AA batteries :)|`|65H77wolaa	out of batteries! LOL|`|1f60cd236744da3f80d9d6fa54fe4bfcaa	he got a big fat contract and got spoiled. hes got the money why work harder.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Lol, way to steal the batteries thing from Kobe.  But ok, for your question.  As someone already stated, he is a bench player.  So he can't really get into a rhythm.  Also, if you'd be so kind to do the math, 13 shots in 4 games.  What is that...3 1/4 shots per game?  When you're only taking 3 shots a game, and you're shooting when you're cold odds are you'll miss 2 of the 3.
AA11016927	No. <br>  <br>   Largemouth Bass/Smallmouth Bass are in the Sunfish family and are closely related to Bluegills, Crappie, Perch, Warmouth, Etc. <br>  <br>  In the South, sometimes you will hear a fisherman use the slang term "Red Bass" for a Redfish/Drum. <br>  <br>  It's just a slang thang!

aiJLiq9Saa	Brashear should be fined/suspended by the NHL for that CHEAP shot....he is the one who has no class|`|wgmf4iwUaa	Do you mean Jim Schoenfeld?<br>  <br>    I missed the fracas......fell asleep on the couch during the game quite honestly. However, I can tell you that Brashear has averaged LESS than 4 minutes PER GAME in this series SO he was probably unlikely to see ice time anyways.<br>  <br>   You didn't think Schoenfeld was still the coach for the Washington Capitals did you? You didn't think that Brashear played a regular shift did you?|`|iHHTwvvoaa	Smart move, it would have given the Rangers a target to take out some of their frusturations.|`|axxQzOCHaa	Class move yes .. it could've started a brawl and Ovechkin could have gotten injured.<br>  <br>  thanks Hawk, that's what I meant, probably more of a 'smart' move than a 'class' one|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Don't know about it being a class move, but definitely a smart one. Brashear is an embarrassment at this point in his career,and has no hockey value whatsoever. Why give the Rangers any ammo going into a Game 7? Ask Flyer fans who cheered wildly when Carcillo pummelled Talbot if that was a wise move. The season is at stake, you do not need the team idiot on the ice.

Pretty disappointing. Wonder how Vegas will turn out next week.|`|1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	It's way too early to pick who will have the momentum at the end of the season but I AM glad for all the 17 and 24 fans right now!  Congrats to all the faithful that have stood by their drivers when others were trying to discredit their teams.  You have to believe that the usual suspects (Johnson, Edwards, Stewart, Kyle and so on) will be in the thick of things during the chase but Matt and Jeff definitely seem to be turning up the heat after winless seasons last year.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|rxCwaaG4aa	I am very excited for how the season has gotten started. I wish it was Gordon with two wins but none the less this has been a great start for him. And you're definitely right, it's fun to see two other guys have the highest profile rivalry, instead of Johnson vs. Edwards. I think Gordon will get a top 5 at Vegas. Gordon's wreck last year there was incredibly horrible. Great question!!!!|`|f2ijQ6nvaa	It would be kewl to see them go at it all year. I had to laugh last night because the announcers were so sure that Gordon would win the race. I mean they would have bet their last dollar on it. Don't count Kenseth out.|`|op9iJRvBaa	I think that would be a great year. They both went win-less last year and both look great this year (so far).|`|ALWGmsvlaa	It nice to see a battle that doesn't involve Johnson, Edwards or Kyle Busch.|`|1d8ff4af85cfc3c1463d61e54d554260aa	I couldn't have said it any better my friend!|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Throw KB in there and you've got yourself a deal.<br>  <br>  I was at the Vegas race last year, it was a worse wreck watching it on TV than it was in person.|`|RLQdhFWXaa	It sure would be a differnt change.   I wouldnt mind seeing that.|`|uouq4KCvaa	It was a great battle between them today, I thought for sure Jeff was going to end that losing streak, he was so close! I expect to see him winning real soon. you said it "he's back"! I love the way he gave credit where it was due tonight to Matt, that was classy of him. Congrats to Matt's fans and I look forward to seeing more out of Jeff again this year!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Non-testing was a big issue in the off season but it looks like it will make things a lot more interesting!! I think this is just a preview of things to come!!|`|MqdSjSvnaa	Really I don't care. Just as long as Ragan does better than JamieMac so he keeps his ride.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Edwards will have to take over when Kenseth loses his big lead.<br>  ...and then there's that guy from JGR in the #18

Apesar disso, a torcida alviverde n?o encarou a goza??o como pejorativa e hoje grita entusiasmada nos jogos: "Pooooorco!"|`|6af615c5b2e787c77ffbae1bb5ce7f13aa	Um porco sendo estuprado por um gavi?o.|`|9b51ef2af0c6396e4a94b739e51c900daa	Galera, o mascote do Palmeiras é um Periquito: E foi o primeiro mascote do Palmeiras (na época Palestra Itália), atribuido pelos italianos devido as cores que o escudo do time ganhou em 1917.<br>  <br>  Assim como o Gavi?o n?o é mascote do Corinthians (Q é o Mosqueteiro), o PORCO tbm n?o é.<br>  <br>  O porco antigamente era usado para ofender a torcida do Palmeiras, que acabou adotando o apelido.<br>  <br>  é isso, se atualizem!...abr?s|`|9sKI1o75aa	O Periquito foi o primeiro mascote do clube.

Enquanto o porco ficava correndo pelo estádio, a torcida dos gambá, ficava gritando: "Da-lhe Porco!!. <br>  <br>  Em 1986, a torcida do Palmeiras acabou adotando o novo Mascote e em todos os jogos do Palmeiras a partir desse ano a torcida n?o deixa de gritar: <br>  "E da lhe, da lhe, da lhe Porco!

Que ninguém duvide do poder de rea??o do Cruzeiro que já foi testado várias vezes. Infelizmente o time ainda n?o se encontrou este ano e acabou dando aquele vexame. Mas alguns pontos há de se considerar: 1o) O Cruzeiro foi o melhor time da competi??o até ent?o, melhor ataque, maior número de pontos ficamos 5 pontos à frente do 2o colocado, temos o artilheiro Araújo com 11 gols enquanto o artilheiro do Galo fez 5 apenas: 2o) Perdemos diversos jogadores importantíssimos durante o campeonato pór contus?es sérias: Marcinho, Renan, Kerlon, Sandro, Nenê, Tiago Heleno 3o) Outros como: Gabriel, Giovani, Luiz?o ainda n?o est?o jogando legal. Fica a pergunta no ar: Será que foi mesmo uma senhora exibi??o do Atlético ou foi um vacil?o do Cruzeiro? Que ninguém duvide da capacidade da dire??o do Cruzeiro, talvez n?o haja muito tempo para rea??o no Mineiro, mas a vida n?o acaba por aí, nos últimos anos o próprio Galo experimentou essa for?a, em 2005 quando foram rebaixados no Brasileir?o perderam as duas para o Cruzeiro. Nos últimos quatro anos ganhamos o Mineiro 3 vezes e fomos vice de um contra o Ipatinga. Nos últimos sete anos o galo venceu apenas um. E por falar em quatro, já vencemos quatro Copas do Brasil(Grêmio, Palmeiras, S?o Paulo e Flamengo) e o Galo nem vice.|`|BPXCMw6Naa	Rapaz eu tava assistindo Botafogo e Flamengo e toda hora pintava a bolinha do gol e sempre do Atlético, e eu realmente fiquei surpreso, mas surpreso mesmo foi quando eu vi o ultimo gol do Atletico!!!<br>  <br>  Caramba eu realmente n?o esperava esse resultado e esse ultimo gol com certeza vai pro hall dos gols mais esquisitos do ano!!!<br>  <br>  Foi dramatico!!!|`|FKAHQdKoaa	Amigo cruzeirense estou muito chateada c tudo isto.

Mas dizer que ele n?o entende n?o pode. Dizer que o Casagrande é chato, beleza, ele é. Mas entende de futebol. Para o Milton Neves ser  bom seria mais fácil se ele soubesse aproveitar o seu tempo, muito ocupado com propagandas e o n?o aproveitando total dos convidados do programa, que normalmente ficam lá quietos até o final.

Outro problema dele é que ele faz piadas com os seus comentaristas enquanto mostra gols e lances chave. <br>  <br>  Em se tratando de comentarista, o melhor de todos, disparado, é o Alex Escobar, do SporTV, ele sabe de tudo sobre futebol e sobre todos os estados, sempre bem informado.

1uLfl0sXaa	India have so far won 4 tests there, all in the initial stages. In the recent past India's performance there was not that good. On paper India have been a better side,but they were never able to come to terms with the extreme conditions there. In 2002, India were brutally thrashed by the Kiwis.<br>  Now, a lot has changed. They no more have Flemming, Astle, Bond or Cairns, where as India have improved a lot. True, NZ gave a fright to Australia, but the current Indian team is better than the Aussies, so I think they have a good chance.<br>  Then, a lot will depend on their mental state: winning and losing is 90% in the mind and rest in performance.|`|b2qV9K5Gaa	Are u trying to console the Indian supporters because u feel India not good enough to win in New Zealand? India want to be the best but ok for excuses in-case they dont get lucky and pull of an upset. To be the best you gotta not only beat the best, but also win under different conditions on different conditions|`|H6CrxE45aa	Look at the rankings and your question will be answered!<br>  <br>  ODI's- There is an even chance and NZ could win because it is thier home ground. There is not much difference between them in the rankings. India would probably win 3-2 or 4-1!<br>  <br>  TESTS- I would expect India to win 2-0 here. England managed to beat NZ here and we know how badly India just beat England in the Tests recently. So this should be easy.<br>  <br>  T20I- India again should win 2-0 because they are world champions at this game :D|`|Kf7P3QuPaa	I am agree that it's not easy but also not impossible.U are rite many guys touring NZ for 1st time but i think they have enough talent to beat NZ in NZ.India's team is more stronger than NZ.So INDIA WILL WIN!!<br>  <br>  Hope for the BEST|`|HyqlF0V0aa	no my dear wife vicky..<br>  it will be a walk in the park...<br>  trust me...<br>  <br>  this is a new strong rejuvenated india and nz gets the opposite of that..<br>  <br>  however, i snicerely hope NZ wins the seris|`|mZ2Uluioaa	NZ is easy~|`|HSXxRjysaa	I agree,Its very very Tough to win in NZ..<br>  and The captain himself touring NZ for the first time !!|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	I think NZ may give them a real contest, but that's my opinion...|`|uLbn4g54aa	I agree.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An7y6IRjBBKmN7YVEAPUvinAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222221042AANH9rY">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|joJhbkX4aa	India is an up and down team so it depends on the mood of the players heading into the match.|`|M8XmhqIhaa	IF India manage to adapt to the freezing winds and the cold rains, then they would be able to win.

The biggest challenge in winning the test series won't be just the Kiwis, it will be the weather.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	i agree<br>  <br>  india wont win|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	We Kiwis are tough|`|gfxXikenaa	yes i agree.<br>  though NZ rankings arent very impressive but on the field they are a very good team .<br>   recently they drawn the ODI series in Australia 2-2 .<br>  so they must be full of confidence too and in their own backyard they have always been a tough team . <br>  ps: Oram and Styris are back in the team!<br>  <br>  For India<br>  Dhoni and co has got a great deal of success but the series win outside the subcontinent was the CB series in Aus back in early 2008 .<br>  for the rest of the season we've been playing series in the subcontinent ,<br>  so it will take alot to adjust and compete in alien conditions.<br>  <br>  but India have recently achieved some historical wins i hope we reap another addition to the list from this NZ tour!! <br>  <br>  its time to change the history , see last one year<br>  1st indivudual Olympic gold<br>  1st ODI series win in Sri Lanka <br>  repeated in Sri Lanka again<br>  lol<br>  <br>  and and and 1st Individulal Oscar for best original track  ;)<br>  in short now its turn to do it in NZ  :P
i3PGjRRfaa	Demonstrate the ROI of sponsorship - just like in ANY economy.............<br>  <br>  The economy is not THAT bad right now.|`|Tu9S1WaNaa	Is there a way that you can include them to come to the track and set up a booth?  Also, is it projected that in this economy that more people will come out to local races instead of travel?  The statistics about how race fans support the brands of sponsors is good.  Also, think of other ways that you can get their name out to fans.  <br>  <br>  If you are aloud to do raffles, maybe you could get items to raffle, or even sell on ebay.  When I had a business, it was easier for me to give away gift certificates or free memberships, rather than giving money.  Then include the names of those that gave the gifts.

BRX96ZUnaa	It's not only A.I.'s fault. He can be productive and play like Chauncey could. Which means distributing the ball, but can score more. A.I doesn't deserve all the blame. But what Chauncey could do that A.I. couldn't was play defense. Chauncey made his teammates and him play defensive all the time. Without defensive, you don't usually win. Anyways Yes I think Curry should be fired from head coach. Since when are the Pistons 500? For the past what 10 years they've had at least 50 game wins. Now no one even knows if they could reach 45. To me, the Pistons should rehire Flip Saunders because he was someone who coached offensively AND defensively.

O3TuQZItaa	Simple, have him get you a 1911A1 in 45ACP. This has been the standard in putting holes in things for the last 90 odd years, and nothing else comes close.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	You have not stated the intended purpose of the gun.  If you are new to shooting handguns I would suggest a .357 magnum with a 6" barrel. You can shoot .38 special ammo in them which doesn't recoil so much until you get the hang of it and then move up to .38 +P or +P+ and finally to magnum ammo.  Practice and informal plinking with .38 special is less expensive than .357 ammo is.<br>  <br>  A longer barrel will give you a longer sight radius and that makes it easier to shoot well.  Also it will had weight to the gun which will reduce felt recoil.<br>  <br>  I would get a double action revolver. The double action trigger pull will be heavy and that is a very good deterrent to accidental discharges, but you can then pull back the hammer manually and get a nice light and usually crisp trigger for precise shot placement when you need to.<br>  <br>  'The .357 doesn't do any one task great.  However is does a lot of task pretty good.  I think it is one of the best all around pistols.  Capable of very good accuracy, powerful enough for even small deer at short ranges, and certainly capable of defense if need be.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|puqg9oVKaa	37 magnum

4Pzql73Oaa	Yeah dude,he is a TOTAL CHUCKER.<br>  <br>  I kinda doubted it at first,but the other day during the Kolkata Knight Riders VS Rajasthan Royals Super - Over, they showed him on his bowling run up from an aerial view camera and yeah it looks like he is taking the damn ball out of his shirt pocket and tossing it at the batsman's face. <br>  They shouldn't be giving him all that attention and hailing him as a hero before clearing up these kinda things first.<br>  He'll probably get reported soon enough if he gets to international cricket.|`|hDOasSPuaa	He does chuck, quite clearly in fact... <br>  <br>  @asdf, He does have a slingshot action but so do Malinga and Fidel Edwards... The difference is Kamran Khan straightens his elbow at the time of delivery while Edwards and Malinga push their arm through completely straight (also Shaun Tait)... Kamran Khan better straighten out his action fast<br>  <br>  EDIT: I know it looks like Malinga chucks... But by the laws of the game he's clean... His arm comes straight through over his shoulder... The problem with Kamran Khan is his arm initially bent straightens slightly and that is not allowed|`|uuHrf7cGaa	What? He has a weird action and he almost stops jumps and delivers the ball in a sling action.<br>  <br>  If a player has a sling action or looks like one, we call it as chuck. Who are we to say? Many have said the same to many players and most of them are doing fine. Let's live it to the refs/umpires to call it and let the brightened ICC take of care of the issue. <br>  <br>  So lately we see Botha, Saeed being called and I will conclude right now, that both will be cleared. Same thing was done on Murali, Shaoib, Malinga and many others - all came out fine.<br>  <br>  The way ICC sees - eventually it may even become a pitch as in baseball and it will also be called legal. Eventually it may become pitching rather than bowling.|`|hVCiSk4Raa	Kamran Khan clearly clearly chucked. IT was so blatant, I am surprised his deliveries weren't  no balled.<br>  <br>  Shabbir was probablya aroudn 50% of what Kamran Khan is, but then Kamran Khan will have the BCCI bedin him.|`|dRED4DvNaa	yes, really he is, IPL is authentic by icc,and must be taken action on that. as on asif was taken earlier on dope test.|`|m29y4kCYaa	Yes he does chuck the ball, his action seems like it, Malinga still looks like a chucker to me|`|yeb7fyHsaa	firstly, no he doesn't chuck. He uses a sling-arm action<br>  <br>  secondly, of course IPL is 'real' cricket. What else can it be? soccer? <br>  <br>  "IPL is not real cricket" as opposed to what? 'fake' cricket? From all I care, cricket is cricket.<br>  <br>  EDIT* oooh, well in that case I see your point. Because it isn't "international" cricket, people don't take much notice of such things as chucking, etc. In that case I agree, but please say that!
Y3KMLdjWaa	Craiglist is always a good place to look. The price of a good entry level hard tail is still around $500, but compared to a few years ago the level/quality of the components has gotten better.|`|fk23CmWeaa	For a quality hardtail, new bikes start at about $500-600, assuming you want something that will work on cross-country trails.  If you just want to ride it on paths, you can go with less than that and a more hybrid-type bike.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with Craigslist or Ebay bikes, but it's better if you have a chance to inspect the bike.  Just remember that fit is the most important thing - go to a bike shop, get fitted and do some test riding, regardless of whether you end up buying new or used - it'll be worth it and will help you determine what fits and what works for you.|`|ZO0qZRiHaa	I wouldn't spend over 200 on a BIKE|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	look at this one: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25558&subcategory_ID=3050" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> This is the best way to start your search for the money. You may be able to haggle a bit in a mom and pop shop but not in a national retail store. You can get other bikes that are not as well equipped for a bit less money but I would recommend that you stay near the $500 mark so you get something reliable and better equipped. Prices for 09' actually went up about 17% over the 08' prices and I would not expect them to go the other way. Be careful where you buy and be certain to get the most for your dollar...Used on Craigslist, No warranty! is that enough to talk you out of it?

YYqrT4jBaa	The Tippmann X-7 is a great scenario/milsim marker and a good woodsball marker. <br>  <br>  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by the M16 Spec Ops parts kit but there should be no real differences between the two kits other than look and possibly wieght.<br>  <br>  I linked a review for the X-7 for you. An X-7 with an M16 body kit is kind of pricey (around $500) so just consider if that's really what you want and can afford.|`|vwNHa2vhaa	The X7 is an awesome marker.  If you purchase between March 1 thru march 31, you qualify for a free X7 flatline barrel or a Response Trigger.  Yours to pick from Tippmann.

Fb5YtlkEaa	As cool as it looks it is a horrible idea for the normal rider to teach their horse to rear. I know a girl who (was a professional) sell their pleasure horse whom she taught rear (along with other tricks) The horse reared every time the new owner got on it(the rider unknowingly signaling it), eventually after a few rides the rider was seriously inured and the horse was injured beyond help and was destroyed. Rearing is extremely dangerous and a horse can quickly learn it as a vice.<br>  <br>  A rearing horse can say to himself 'If I rear, she falls off' He will use this and become a dangerous animal. <br>  <br>  So why do people make horse's rear? It takes a special horse, not training. The horse's Mental health and psychology but be 'abnormal' and under no condition must the horse think on its own. The horse is 100% reliant on his trainer.<br>  <br>  Also what they don't show you in the movies is that the trainer is on the ground signaling the horse with his hand and a whip. This method is much safer.<br>  <br>  If you still dead set on giving your horse this vice and putting yourself and your horse in harm/or death's way then there is only one word of advice.<br>  <br>  ONLY work with a certified trick trainer and have the trainer train the horse for you. Do NOT ever under any circumstances get cocky enough to believe you can teach this too him safely. So if you do want the risk and the vice that is the only way to do it. Don't try to show off the trick either. Never ask ANY trick (lay down, bow, etc.) on any surface except a dirt or riding surface. Slippage, impact, etc. can make any trick turn into a disaster.|`|NQGpw0x4aa	1. it's a bad idea<br>  2. it's a bad idea<br>  3. it's a bad idea<br>  4. it's a bad idea<br>  5. it's a bad idea<br>  6. it's a bad idea<br>  <br>  your horse will never be the same. it's a bad habit and a really bad idea. a friend of mine taught her horse to rear on command, someone accidentally did the signal and the horse reared her off in the middle of the road. the horse landed on her, she got a concussion, broke her arm, and shattered her ankle. she will never ride again. and she rode western and had a horn to hold on to.|`|e297ec36aa9e3904ff06e84dd4fce511aa	drop a few mice or rats out of your duffel bag right under Mr. Horse's feet.

Most orgs allow older helmets to some degree, for example in SCCA i think snell 2000 is still allowed.  <br>  <br>  If you need a new helmet in 2010, well, at least you can sell your lightly used helmet, and I'm sure it will still have some value since other racers may be able to use it for at least a few years.

PQJyaFDXaa	It IS possible to do both.  It's called cross-training.  Check out programs that train for an Iron Man triathalon (running, swimming, biking marathons one after another.)<br>  <br>  While it is possible, it may not be advisable at 13.  Both are endurance sports that take a lot of time and effort.  In addition, I'm not sure what the impact is on a developing body.  I would pick one.  You might start with both, then stay with the one where you are naturally better.<br>  <br>  While different muscles are used, your body does need time to recover from endurance stresses.  It's not the same as alternating muscle-building with cardiovascular exercise.  (You're picking two cardiovascular sports.)

Rede Globo e Rede Record (que têm os cifr?es) querem mai$ e mai$, ajuda do BNDES e dos dízimos dos fieis apenas n?o bastam.  O povo só se ferra, só perde dinheiro, os atletas continuam sem patrocínio, os cartolas, por sua vez, v?o ficar por cima da carne seca, infelizmente hoje e sempre que a gente deixar. O Brasil n?o precisa de terroristas com toda essa gente indecente mirando na nossa cabe?a e nos chamando de estúpido querendo que a gente engula uma Copa e uma provável futura sede Olímpica. O Brasil é violento, o Brasil carece de educa??o e o Brasil é injusto demais para esse tipo de evento. N?o é falta de patriotismo, n?o é vergonha o que eu sinto, apenas creio que tenho o direito e o dever de expressar minha opini?o. Seria ótimo assistir a uma Copa no meu país, mas seria melhor ainda se o meu país desse condi??o de emprego fixo, salário justo, saúde regular, seguran?a e educa??o para todos. Isso acontece na Comunidade Européia, Inglaterra, nos Estados Unidos, no Jap?o, Austrália, Canadá, n?o no Brasil nem tampouco na Colombia, e que me desculpem os hermanos argentinos e os endinheirados árabes, chineses e indianos, mas todos continuam t?o terceiro (ou às vezes quarto!) mundo quanto a gente.|`|a386b46712149b849b702a849a7e9368aa	Yes|`|a6cb5f2c68e5bafad02c5a2a48dab6c7aa	Com certeza n?o.|`|adf5040ccb71204329bd2d045270e255aa	Danilo, ...Danilo.

O Léo Moura subia toda hora e n?o voltava para marcar! <br>  <br>  No segundo tempo o jovem goleiro do Botafogo se preciptou, fez falta e foi expulso. Ai no gol de pênalti a ra?a rubro negra come?ou a cantar e o Botafogo sentiu a press?o da maior torcida do país.<br>  <br>  N?o acho que o estadual já está decidido, o goleiro reserva do Botafogo defendeu o time durante quase 5 anos, sendo titular por muito tempo. O Botafogo perdeu um goleiro e o Diguinho, o Flamengo perdeu apenas o ex-vascaíno Léo Lima.<br>  <br>  Espero que no próximo domingo o Ney acorde e comece o jogo com o Renato Augusto armando no meio de campo com o Renato e o Juninho Paulista (no lugar do Clayton) mais à frente, e o Souza na frente.<br>  <br>  Clayton, Roni e Jaílton devem entrar apenas no segundo tempo para dar gás ao time. <br>  <br>  Se n?o colocar o Juninho domingo que vem vai acontecer o que vimos hoje, o Renato Augusto sendo marcado por dois e n?o rendendo nada!!! <br>  <br>  Mas mudando de assunto, a torcida do Galo pode come?ar a tirar as penas pois na Copa do Brasil o Botafogo vai cozinhar o Galo fácil fácil!
