4owUg43oaa	Because people desensitize when they think they are anonymous.  That's why we behave badly while driving, too.  Any sheild-- a car, the internet-- isolates us from good behavior because we don't immediately see the consequences of our bad behavior.  Karma, however, will get them in the end, so never fear!
5fkqsnBJaa	Kaspersky, AVG and Norton 360 are the only anti-virus currently supported by "7".|`|tOCESHLYaa	There's a good chance that because you are using a beta OS that Avast will not show as working. Most of the anti-virus programs are not yet supported in Windows 7. You can check with Avast to be sure. When using Beta software many programs will not work or do not work right.|`|AA11865529	That happened to me yesterday with AVG antivirus and Windows XP.  I rebooted and the message went away.     It could be some kind of spyware. (I scanned and it was not a virus)|`|3OpZuIByaa	Hmm. I've had that happen before on XP.I  I downloaded an antivirus program that XP didn't recognize in it's security page.     I can probably say with confidence that the particular antivirus program you're using is not recognized by Windows yet. But don't worry, it's not that it's not protecting you, just that the guys who developed Windows didn't impliment AVAST into their list of supported AVAST products, yet.     As long as you see it running in the right bottom of your taskbar, it should be fine. With later updates, I'm sure they will add it to their list as long as it's a credible program and supported 100%.

1WaTRF3Caa	You probably have fallen victim to the "fake" virus scanners. These will pop-up CONSTANTLY warning you that you have spyware/viruses. Then it will do a scan and come up with TONS of issues. The thing is that most of these issues aren't real. The real problem is the fake virus scanner it's self.    First off: Go to http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and download that program to C:\    Now, shut down your computer, turn it back on and repeatedly press F8 after your BIOS disappears. This will bring up a menu, choose "Safe Mode". Once safe mode boots, log on as the administrator. Now, goto My Computer, then goto C:\. RENAME the install file you downloaded. Rename it to anything, just so it's not the original file name (spyware will stop this from running if you don't rename it). Now run it and install it. After it is installed, open it and run a "Full scan" on every hard drive partition. This will take awhile. After it is done running, remove the problems it finds.    Now, shut down. Turn the computer back on and press F8 again. This time choose "Safe mode with networking". Log on as the administrator and connect to the internet (wireless probably won't work, use a cord). Now run Anti-Malware again and goto the updates tab, update it and run another full scan of your computer. Remove any more problems it finds.    FINALLY, shut down and boot up like you normally do. If your problem is fixed, GREAT!! If not, then do a clean install of windows.    After you are clean of spyware, download and install "Firefox" from www.getfirefox.com Use this rather than Internet Explorer, it's more secure. Also, download "Spybot Search & Destroy", install it and update it. After it's updated, apply immunizations. This will prevent your computer from even connecting to sites that install this crap on your computer.    Good Luck!
BB3RcWwZaa	Sounds like a video card issue. Try reseating the thing or checking to see if it's getting adequate power from the power supply. If there are addition VGA or DVI outputs apart from those on the video card slots, try removing the video card entirely and trying to use those to check if the video card really is the problem.|`|cILeS32iaa	Seems to me like you did not turn it off properly the first time since the computer was on when you turn it off manually.    Or one or two of your hardware has failed once or twice to have caused the problem. Might be a sign some hardware is about to go out of order or it could just be user error.    Remember to let the computer turn off by itself fully before you switching the main power off.    Good luck.      http://whattodo-jiangchen.blogspot.com/|`|ERYT1ylraa	Clean your registry with a tool such as CCleaner

Skill does allow a search by chip-set, but they didn't have a part listed for the 865G Chip-set in your system. This is why I can't say for sure if the G. Skill part will work or not.   On the websites that do offer the ability to search by specific computers:  Kingston recommends this part: http://www.wikio.com/product/kingston-kt...

1ibHGaAhaa	I would think you can shut it down and boot OS X. I wish I could help more but I run XP and Vista on a virtual machine that way if anything happens is restricted to a virtual space and can't mess up things to bad.  I recommend that if you can to get parallels and run just about any OS you want without risking too many problems.  No rebooting and you can run the OS simultaneously and also in an integrated way. It takes care of drivers and all of the stuff windows needs. Good luck!    http://www.parallels.com/products/deskto...
DQgx8TPmaa	Since it only has a gig of ram and a 2.2 ghz processer, no. Vista requires a lot more "oomph" from its hardware. that stuff would be fine for XP though. Ifyou get one with Vista, make sure it has at least a 2.5Ghz processer and at least 2 gigs of ram.

1WaTRF3Caa	The fan doesn't always have to be running on some laptops.  Most of the time (to save battery power) it won't run the fan until needed.  If it gets EXCESSIVELY hot (hot enough that it's uncomfortable to touch), stop using the computer immediately and bring it to a trusted technician.    You can help keep the computer cool by not using it on soft surfaces (bed, blankets, carpet), these surfaces block vents the computer needs for airflow.  Always try and use the laptop on a hard, sturdy surface.|`|1OI9tTDzaa	if the processor gets too hot the fan on top of it will start automatically the heat you are actually experienceing is the the hard drive heating u because you didn't start caching therefore windows or watever ur os is needs to access your harddrive more time so more hot    it depends on your current configuration should you be able to afford caching with lots of thing to consider HD space Ram USB's link speed IDE drive connection

Because 'open' networks have no encryption between your unit and the router, everything you send or receive is in plain text.  Meaning that a hacker, with a commonly available application, can intercept and log all of your traffic 'packets'; and with the right software, can run brute force programs that crack passwords.  So the best advice is: do not visit sites that are private, or require 'log-in', or credit cards, banks, etc.  The only secure methods to use, over a 'hotspot' is a VPN , or if the site is SSL.|`|eQRJFXO7aa	As long as their is a Wi-Fi connection you should be able to connect for free.

Sometimes, if I know that we have friends in common, and they seem like I /might/ know them, then I'll add them, check out their profile, and see if I know them for certain.  If I don't recognize them after that, I delete them.  I know it's not the safest, but it's potentially safer than sending them a message to ask who they are which gives them access to your limited profile for 30 days, rather than giving them access to your regular profile for a few minutes then removing access altogether.|`|AA11991883	I have accepted people because the name was familiar....but then I found they were not people I knew anyway.Names change from marriage and such..so you are never sure until you read the profile.|`|m7xHAkDPaa	People accept people to see if they know them.

er2VCmiCaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.

Added on toolbars are notorious in causing problems.    Try this go to Start > All programs > Accessories > System Tools > Click "Internet Explorer (no add-ons).    Now run IE for a good long while and see if the crashing and freezing disappears.    If it does help, you must now determine the specific add-on the is causing the problem.    Go to Tools > Manage Add-ons and disable, one by one, each of the "Add-ons currently loaded in Internet Explorer" until the problem dissapears. Then either leave it disabled or download and install a new copy of it.

It could be that the boot sector or master boot record got corrupt somehow either by a virus or some other form of malicious code that infiltrated your os.  In order to fix that, the first form of action that you would need to take is to obtain a windows os cd, either vista or xp depending on what os you have.   All of the os cds have a recovery  console or  repair option that would allow the computer to revert back to its original settings.  Is the computer able to boot up in safe mode?   Please mention the type of model computer that you have and also the operating system so I can further assist you with this issue.   But in the interm, I suggest getting the os cd and booting from it to go into the recovery console.  If there is something wrong with the  boot volume, then you should run the repair wizard which will attempt to get your os back to its original settings.

Hope this helps.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	It may be symptoms of Malware, deeply rooted in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    To be sure you could get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware often blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, as you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

Based on your question, I am assuming you are a teenager? I worry about teens using any internet socializing network. I am a high school teacher and I listen to my students comments on such matters. You have to be VERY careful about what information you post on the internet. You may think you are being safe, but unfortunately there are many people out there that do not have your best interest at heart. It is very easy to post one detail too many.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The differences between streaming and downloading are: a) you can stream a continuing stream.  IOW, you can watch a 10 hour long event that's streamed to you.  The file for that, if you were downloading a file, could be enormous - and you'd have to wayt until the event was over.  b) You watch the data as it comes in a stream, you save it to disk in a download.  (You can save a stream to disk if you like.)    As far as the server program running on the server - usually either Apache or IIS - you connect and ask the server for something.  It logs the request.  Period.  Whether you request a web page, a download or a stream.  Streaming *IS* downloading from a server, it's just (on YOUR computer) feeding it to a display program, rather than saving it to disk.    Computers don't have identities and they're not registered (except for recall and safety notice purposes) - connections have "identities" (IP addresses).  Your address and the time are logged.  If the matter warrants a court order, your provider knows who was using which IP address at any given moment.    RIAA (the Recording Industry Association of America) HAS sued people by getting their IP addresses.  They no longer do that.  Now your provider warns you the first time they catch you.  (Some nice ones give you a couple of warnings.)  Then, if you don't stop, they terminate your internet service and blackball you (so no other company will give you internet service).  It's easier doing it that way than having to go to court and having to prove things.|`|39mxsxvCaa	I don't know what you just said|`|RUmNeAqYaa	nothing have ever traced me and my computer is full of downloads mostly music but nothing has ever happened.|`|DxQ5QEkzaa	Of course the server will know your information, regardless of whether you stream or download. Think it through...    The server has to know your IP in order to know where to stream the information. Streaming is simply downloading portions of the file a little at a time rather then the whole file at once. You download the first portion of say a youtube video so you can begin watching before it's done, and as you're watching you download the rest of the video in pieces. Well youtube has to know your IP in order to get you the file. And yes, your IP is stored in a log somewhere. EVERYTHING you do on the internet can be traced... it's just sometimes harder to trace certain things.

er2VCmiCaa	Microsoft Registry Problems = Slow Computer!    The Windows registry, stored on your computer and in several files, records the interaction between hardware, memory space, and addressing. Containing information and settings for all the hardware, software, users, and preferences of your computer, whenever you make a change to the Control Panel settings, file associations, system policies, or installed software, the changes are reflected and stored in the registry. The Windows operating system    continually references this information during its operation.    When the Windows registry becomes very large, your computers can become very slow and it can cause it to be unstable. Some computer users will spend a lot of time and effort going through the registry and trying to fix the slow computer manually. Not only can this be a daunting and frustrating task, it is also a very risky one.    Clean your Registry can make your computer faster  Most computer users find this task confusing and time consuming and those who are not advanced computer experts run the risk of permanently damaging their system by trying to fix their windows registry manually. Using a registry clean and repair application is the fastest, easiest, and safest way to fix a slow computer. While there are a number of registry repair applications available, few offer a comprehensive set of features that enable you to completely clean your registry safely. It is crucial that you choose a Windows registry repair product that you can trust.

Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.   a) Right click of C Disk.   b) Click properties.   c) Click tools tab.   d) Click "Defragment now".   e) Click Defragment.    2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.    3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.   a) Open your Start menu.   b) Click Run   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.   f) Click "OK"    4. Check for Spyware and Adware  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.

If you are still confused about which one to get - get the biggest one you can afford with the most amount of RAM that you can afford. The iMac will take up to 4GB of RAM.|`|CzdxFiRLaa	Hi,  Welcome to the world of Macs.  As with any computer you need to get one that suits your needs.  My advice is get the one that has the biggest hard drive you can afford and with at least 2G of RAM.  If you are thinking of the iMac lite, or thin, what ever the new one is called, it does have some restrictions on attachment devices.    You may not feel as though you need the extra memory at the moment, but I can guarantee that you will in the future.  also sign up for the Apple Care Plan too... it is of great value if there are any issues with the computer.    Happy computing.    David

You will have to convert the AVI to a MPG/MPEG file before you can burn it to a DVD as a DVD movie/video.    A program called DVD Flick is the one that is the simplest that iv'e found. It will convert avi to mpg and burn it for you if you have Nero.  Go here to find a free converter: http://www.videohelp.com/tools?toolsearc...|`|Cj5fynJiaa	any decent burning program will do it.  All you have to do is to select burn files and folders.  And you do not have to convert to dvd.  I generally back up my avi files using ashampoo burning studio.  Great program and very stable.  Also gives a very nice burn.  I just open the program and select burn files and folders.  Then I drag the .avi's I want into the interface and tell it to burn.  From there I set advanced options like burn/drive speeds etc...  You DO NOT have to convert unless you want to.  if they are movie files and you have DVIX on your dvd player then you are just wasting space...  I generally convert when I am backing up for others because not all these days have DVIX dvd players but I generally just burn the avi's to dvd or cd myself because I have a DVIX dvd player...

AA10152260	This same item caught one of my coworkers off guard and ended up with an infected PC.  It took a while, but we were able to get it cleaned out without having to reformat the computer.  The main thing was to get his PC off of the network so no others would get infected.    The site you gave a link for has since been blocked as an attack site, so at least hopefully no one else will get pulled in to that trap.    Your assumption is correct...it is definitely a scam.    Again, run a complete scan on your Mac...even several, to be sure it is out of you system.|`|ahRXIkbmaa	It is a pop-up ad that that tries to convince you that you have a bunch of viruses when you don't. The e Macs as I recall, are all power-PC based computers, which makes it physically impossible for them to run windows binaries. The scan is probably a JavaScript simulation and doesn't actually do anything  on a Power-PC system.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	UPDATE: Dear Shadow Wolf, if eMac means Apple Mac, you DO get viruses too, look at this answer for more: http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...   and if eMac means eMachines, it is a PC.    Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    P.S.: Forward this answer to all the people you exchanged Email with since you started getting this problem but only after you have completely eradicated it !|`|wUqeZl3Saa	I'm not even sure that Antivirus 2009 virus can infect a Mac of any flavor. I've seen the popup and I laughed when it did it's "scan" and I'm on a WinXP box that I keep fairly secure. I doubt it can affect a Linux box either.    If you watch the security section of Answers, you'll see plenty of people who clicked rather than closed. It is hitting a lot of people with poor judgment.    As long as you closed the window and didn't click it, there is just about a  zero chance it installed anything. The fact that you are on a Mac makes the chance even more remote.

I have know several people get this notice and it loads a bunch of garbage onto your computer.  Someone I had worked with got this on their computer.  It took several virus scans with their regular anti-virus scanner before they were able to fully get rid of it.  Hopefully your virus definitions are up to date.  Disconnect your computer from the internet and keep running a scan until it fully checks clean.  It took six full scans by my coworker before they were able to get it fully out of their system.

5zSSGKBpaa	You have to aware the if you compile programs from source you may not always get all the dependencies right and have problems with the program. That is the purpose of the "package manager"; to be sure all the dependencies are taken care of. If you have noticed when installing a program from the command line or synaptic, when you tell it to install a program it will also install some other programs along with the one you want; those are the dependent program needed for your program to work properly.  Here are some links on how to install from source.  If installing from source is your thing you should check out gentoo.   Have fun
48b3edd2873299f4c358a97e93456e13aa	I got a real, part-time job programming computers the second week of my freshman year in college. It was funded by a government grant and I was able to learn on the job. It was also a very long time ago.    After I was well into my career, we had a few "summer interns" come through. The problem was that they were there such a short time their contribution was fairly minimal. There was no process in place for a regular employee to take over what they created, so it usually was just discarded. It was somewhat a "make work" arrangement.|`|WQ0DzpByaa	Internships are a good way to get your foot in the door and the experience looks good on a resume.|`|WS95be3Raa	You got A.S. majoring in Microcomputer Applications???

A router has a physical firewall which also safely splits your internet signal for using on more than one device (sharing internet).     You may currently have a software firewall installed - which is ok, but I would not put to much faith in a software firewall, whether its Trend Micro or Norton or whoever.    BUT, you just can not beat the protection of a router firewall - period. ANY SOFTWARE FIREWALL you use WILL NOT MATCH A ROUTER FIREWALL.    Its like driving a bicycle to work (software firewall) or driving a lamborghini to work (router). There is that much of a difference!     If you get a router - throw the software firewall out the window. Uninstall it! A software firewall WILL SLOW YOUR INTERNET SPEED DOWN. A router will not slow your speed down!     A software firewall runs on your pc, slowing your internet down and likely slowing your pc down! STAY THE HECK AWAY FROM THEM IF YOU CAN!    A software firewall sits/runs on your computer. A router firewall must be hacked first prior to anyone being able to manipulate your computer, a very difficult thing to accomplish.     Now, if you use a wireless connection to a router you will lose out on some of the security strength. A wireless connection is not very difficult for a somewhat tech savvy person to hack. Plus wireless will slow your internet speed down.    So, I highly recommend getting a router and attaching a CAT5 cable to it and to your pc. It's not difficult but if you are intimidated have a friend or pro do it.    Honestly it takes about 5-10 minutes pending a few technicalities.  Like resetting your internet modem.  Like changing password on router (Must do this!)  Running the cables, plugging in the power.  Etc.    If you have a device you want to connect wirelessly... also change wireless settings on router - make sure to use a unique security key.    Routers have the ability to connect wired and wireless devices simultaneously.    Plus routers have many advantages!  Example:  If you suspect someone is trying to attack you...  You can pull up the router IP log.  And find out which IP Addresses are communicating with your router.  With a small amount of research you could... find out which IP address is legit and which one is not.    You could even pinpoint the IP address location from websites on the internet and which ISP it belongs to.    You could report a hacker to his ISP and get him/her into major trouble.     Now, a devastatingly great hacker can mask his actions with skill, but I would not worry to much about them - why would they care about individuals when they can hack corporations or millionaire or etc.    $50 will get you a very decent router with wire and wireless capabilities. I highly recommend a Linksys router.     Linksys is owned and operated by Cisco. Cisco is primo tops number one in the router business. Cisco does not make home routers but Linksys (subdivision of Cisco) does.    Cisco is so dominant in the market, I guarantee you your internet data has passed through their business class routers many thousands possibly millions of times without you ever knowing.     Good luck fella.

FNvv74UQaa	Try a set of headphones in the speaker jack just to make sure the jack isn't defective. You DO have volume control on the computer, click start, go to control panel, and select Sounds Speech and Audio Devices. Click Adjust System Volume, make sure the volume is tuned up.     Also right click on My Computer, left click Properties, then select the hardware tab,  then click the device manager. Expand the sound, video and game controllers. See that there are no yellow exclamation marks next to anything.     Generally speaking, you don't install software or drivers for speakers, they just work, so it's most likely not a driver issue for your speakers..|`|fjkRIUSnaa	you have got to have volume control somewhere that has got to be the problem|`|xs9RGfAZaa	look at the back of the computer they mite have went out of the back|`|AbCeEZIhaa	You prob just need a sound driver. I assume you have tried plugging them in and restarting your computer? What kind of speakers do you have? You can prob find the driver on the Net to download.|`|kMevVPiYaa	What I would try doing is, looking at the brand of the speakers. For example if they are Logitech then go to the Logitech site and see if they have the hardware for your speakers to install. I had to do that once for my keyboard, I dont know if this helps or not, but its worth a try rather than a system recovery...|`|1SaVZNuvaa	You need to install drivers for your sound card (which are probably onboard on your motherboard).    Find the disk that came with your PC or motherboard and install the sound drivers from there.    Or find out the model of your motherboard and use that to find sound drivers in google.|`|41KTqJcmaa	If its just your speakers you should go to your control panel first, or even faster look to the right of your desktop taskbar where your computer clock is if you have a speaker icon. that usually means your speakers work. Or in your control panel it has a icon in classic view that says sounds thats where your sound devices are. And you can last step check your device manager and see if your sound driver aka multimedia driver is installed properly. If all else fails check your sound with a simple headphone set plug it into the back of your pc, sound card if it works your speakers are the issue not your pc.|`|QEd4AC22aa	I take it these are new added speakers to your computer that are suppose to work with it?  And you have never used them?  First did you plug them in correctly?  There are 3 holes in the back of your computer usually it is the one in the middle for the speakers.  People often plug into the other holes by mistake.  System recovery will not help if you have never used the speakers before.  Second, if this does not work sometimes there is a speaker adjustment icon down at the bottom of your desk top.  Click on this and take a look how it is set up.  You already mentioned it is turned on and not muted.  Really don't think it is anything serious.
MPBRAgMIaa	Install DivX7 from www.divx.com, before closing the installation check the box to associate mkv files with DivX. You can also try installing the latest Xvid codec from www.xvid.org. Finally you can try updating your AC3 Filter/codec which can be done through either Microsofts Media player website or by typing ac3 filter into a search engine and this will direct you to the AC3 filter website.   Some older versions of Nero do not support MKV or Hd files very well. Also CCCP does seem to have audio sync problems with some high quality video files.

CTGHeMwPaa	Blackcompe is right, but the firstHalf could be more easily done with simply doing   i/100.

Why don't you convert the int to a String, then split the String into two, and then convert the Strings into two ints. Basically:    String s = Integer.toString(number);  String num1 = s.substring(0,2);  String num2 = s.substring(2);  int n1 = Integer.parseInt(num1);  int n2 = Integer.parseInt(num2);  int answer = n1+n2;    I tested this, and it works, but only for 4-digit numbers.    EDIT: I didn't want to think of a mathematical way. Use M.L.'s way, it should work.

I just unplug it, and click enter.  You may be able to change the boot priority, in the master setup. Change it to HDD as no. 1. As default, CD/DVD will be number 1.  If this works, change it back to default settings and see if it continues to work, if not, leave it.    But, you may aswell just re-install Windows though if you've tried all this!
plgoc2xSaa	A computer is a lot more than just a processor and a video card.  You can either give the full specs and we can help from there, or if you bought the computer pre-made (an hp, dell, acer, etc.) you can give the model and it'll contain all the specs.    Typically, to try and answer your question the best I can with this limited information, if you have a dual core processor you're not in dire need of an upgrade on it.  If you have 2GB ram in Vista, upgrading to 4GB can be a serious performance boost on the games that require a lot of resources being used at once.  A faster processor may speed up load times and the generation of the content, but in comparison to memory, won't increase the FPS as much in a situation that has a lot of content loaded at once (a game like GTAIV will have many things loaded at once so everything can be accessed real time).    Go to http://www.ibuyknowing.com/redirect/newe... and type in the search: "F2-6400CL5D-4GBPQ"|`|iHT3N9n5aa	i would probs go the RAM if uhav vista and the processor if not-cos vista uses heaps of RAM for visual efects etc,|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Depends, if you are on XP, then 4GB ram is useless.  It wont see anything over 3.5.    Neither of which will make your framerates much better.  Upgrade your video card for that.|`|fEqMug5Oaa	Your graphics card is great and your processor is okay, so i suggest you get 4 gigs of ram.     http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    These are the ram stick i have and they work great!|`|JmVix7DBaa	Normally for a case like yours I would say to get the Q6600 processor, but you have a Compaq and you will most likely not be able to upgrade  your processor.    Main reason why I wouldn't upgrade the processor:    Your current CPU has a FSB of 800mhz.  A q6600 has a FSB of 1066mhz.  You would not get the full benifit of having a q6600, plus it may not be compatible with your mobo.    Although the q6600 is one of my favorite processors, for now, just upgrade your ram, unless you feel like installing a new mobo to go along with it.

ezcaRxLtaa	Hi    1. Start with creating a new document, with white background    2. Use the "Gradient Tool" to make a background that is white to pink going left to right.    3.Use the "Text Tool" to create text and then click on "Transform to selection". Outline of selected text will appear.    4. Next, from the main top menu goto: Selection >> Expand    5. Expand the transformed text a little but not too much...say a setting of about 5. May need to experiment with this a little to get is just right. This makes the text look "fatter" for the outside border.     6. Right mouse click and select "Crop"    7. Goto "Text Tool" again and with the same text, but this time use black colour. Click OK... and the text should appear over the white/pink gradient background. You may need to position it over the gradient evenly using the mouse pointer.    8. Right mouse click select "Validate text"    9. Goto "Text Tool" again.... and with same text..select "Transform to Selection"    10. Again.. goto Selection >> Expand ( use the same setting as before)    11. Right mouse click ..select "copy"       12. Open your photo picture ..then.... Right mouse click select "Paste" then drag text into position.    Done!

I'd also run a deep scan with your anti-virus program.|`|LikrEW7Zaa	I get these all the time.      Our Greeting Card Service allow people to send Electronic Greetings via email FREE of Charge. We DO NOT send greeting cards from our system to anonymous users.     Every card created through our system results in two emails being delivered.     One, the Sender : A thank you message is sent to the creator of the card. If someone enters your email address as the sender, then such an email can come to you.     Two, the Receiver : An email is sent informing the receiver that someone has created a card for him.     In both situations emails are sent by the sender and you have not received the emails because of a spam.     That came from their site. I'm not sure how to stop it, try not to send cards from that site for a while and see what happens. That's what Iv'e been doing.

It may sound boring and most users don't even do it, but you should to know why your videos aren't being allowed. It doesn't matter whether you say "No copyright infringement is intended". You have still copyrighted it because it is owned by a commercial company and it is not yours. Youtube muted it because they have to it is the law. Sadly I was subscribed to a user who posted Arthur clips on his profile. Eventually his account was terminated because Youtube received a legal notice from PBS warning they would sue if action wasn't taken. So yes Youtube is facing many lawsuits right now including one from Warner brothers because of these users. You may think it's silly or unfair but the fact is this is being done to protect you so that your not the one who has to get sued or potentially jailed.|`|r8Sme80raa	>"How do i get around the copyrighted thing on youtube?"

dkpIjt5jaa	Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Avast is good but takes a lot of resources in the computer.    If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.       If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.      Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !    Don't install toolbars and stay clear of AVG.|`|9BL6LFJ9aa	I have used AVG Anti Virus, Zone Alarm Firewall, Spy-bot Search and Destroy a spyware killer for years. I have recently added superantispyware. They are all free for personal use and I have had no trouble with Viruses Trojans Hackers etc. I have just upgraded to AVG free 8.0 and all seems good so far. Zone Alarm allows a lot of personal configuration unlike the Windows Firewall. They can all be downloaded from http://www.download.com/ I also use Windows Defender from the Microsoft site.

Good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"    For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products?)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here.|`|NpKR2SENaa	Yes, MS Defender is good to have. It will hep you to prevent spyware, adware, and malware attacking your computer. It works great just like Spybot - SD, you can try to download it from http://www.safer-networking.org/en/home/...  Another security you should have is Antivirus Software, just check on your laptop - perhaps i already has Antivirus software installed, but if it don't I suggest for you to use Symantec products - http://www.symantec.com/ -  but it will cost you some money to buy it, or you can use a free Antivirus software like AVG - http://free.avg.com/  I hope this answer will help you to solve your problem and I'm sorry for my bad English ^_^

Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is wmv file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..      --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

2F5XkiHLaa	It sounds like you are set up well, except for one thing, the firewall. Windows firewall only protects inbound; it has no protection outbound, so it's only ? a firewall. You need to get one that has both ways protection.    Suggest you get ZoneAlarm or Outpost. Either one is a solid firewall.     ZoneAlarm  http://www.zonealarm.com/store/content/c...  Outpost  http://www.agnitum.com/products/outpostf...    If you want to test your system for leaks, here's sites to do that:  http://analyze.privacy.net/test.asp   http://www.speedguide.net/scan.php   http://network-tools.com/     Ccleaner is a very good program, if you know how to use it. I've used it for years & am pleased with it. It's great for cleaning out junk files, but it's not good for cleaning the registry. For a great registry cleaner, get Eusing Free Registry Cleaner  http://www.eusing.com/free_registry_clea...    I've also used ZoneAlarm for years, and it's a fine program  .|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Here are my suggestions (and warnings) for free software (I tried all personally):    Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one "software" Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner, two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) and one Email scanner (if your Virus scanner does not include one) but have at least one of each (for security) as there is no excuse to leave yourself wide open.    So you should also use a "software" Firewall other than the Windows built-in one.     If you need both Virus scanner and firewall, then the Comodo firewall http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d... is the top contender.     Use it in combo mode (Antivirus/Firewall) at installation.    The firewall itself is very robust and the just-released version 3 includes a well-designed intrusion detection system and Vista compatibility. Comodo also supports internet connection sharing, whereas the free versions of Kerio and ZoneAlarm do not.     Make sure that you install it in "Advanced" mode, because the "Basic" installation has the HIPS ( Host-based Intrusion-Prevention System ) disabled.       If you just want to use Comodo as a Firewall then for Virus scanning, use Avira instead http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... It is very light on resources and the detection rate of viruses and rootkits is outstanding.    However, it does not include anti-spyware and anti-adware protection so add an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) and see below for adware scanning.    Anti-Malware/Spyware suggestions:    Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware: http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... is a good choice and has gotten many people out of jams if you keep it updated.     Spybot: http://www.download.com/Spybot-Search-am... is also a good choice if you use it regularly and keep it updated.          Cleaner suggestion:     Glary Utilities: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk files or remnants of installs (there is always some).    Do not use Ccleaner ( In my time at helping others, I have found it more destructive than helpful and I had to rebuild systems nuked by it in the past ).      And of course, NEVER have them working scans at the same time.    When you scan, only the Firewall should be running alongside (in learn mode if need be).    Use a methodic "one after the other" kind of scan !      P.S.: DO NOT USE toolbars as they contain a form of spyware (even the ones from big names) and stay away (or get rid of) AVG as that thing is crap.|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Routers are firewalled against inbound attacks, and it's not easy to test how well they are firewalled. If you get any spyware on your pc neither your router, nor the Windows firewall, nor the Trend firewall, will be a lot of use in stopping the spyware sending your personal information out to the bad guys. See these firewall test results:  http://www.matousec.com/projects/firewal...

AA10016890	All you have to do to get started is to download a few programs and then get a good book. The best part about programming is that both of these things are free on the internet, really! And not cut-rate, stripped-down stuff either, you can get the best tools that exist for programming and some of the best books there are all for free. I'm going to concentrate on a rather new language,  Ruby.    Ruby is an amazingly useful programming language that blends little bits and pieces from other very good languages.    Some advantages:     * you can write short, simple programs that do real stuff! Want to download a webpage? Here:    require 'net/http'  Net::HTTP.start( 'www.ruby-lang.org', 80 ) do |http|  ????print( http.get( '/en/LICENSE.txt' ).body )  end     * There is a brilliant language tutorial called "Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby." This is a well-written, thorough introduction that's very fun to read (and where I got the above example).     * There is a  really awesome toolkit called "Shoes" that's written in Ruby. Check out Shoes because it lets you build great-looking programs that are almost crazily easy to make: http://shoooes.net/about/    Lastly, I have a small nit to pick with some of the other posters, HTML isn't a programming lannguage. Don't listen to someone that says it is, they don't really know what they're talking about.    Sorry, but I see that misinformation propagated all too often.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You don't learn a language first, you learn programming first.  Try http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0...    If you just want to fool around, download a free copy of Visual Studio from Microsoft - but you'll never learn programming that way.|`|NP30xUFVaa	I started off using Visual Basic 6 (VB6). I loved it and would have learned more but I didnt have the friends to teach me like I wanted. :(|`|1CLazt8Taa	Try Visual Basic and google some basic visual basic tutorials|`|tRMgbldcaa	You can write programs in a slew of different areas.  Notepad is the most basic however it is also one of the most universal.  Through it you can write java, c/c++, vb, vbs, html/xml/php/cgi/etc..., and many more.    I would recommend VB as a starting language (Visual Basic) as it is very easy.  Here is a breakdown of the main programming languages and what they can be typed in (created in).    C/C++  -  "The Strongest Language"  Notepad, Notepad++, TextPad, Microsoft Visual Studio, Eclipse, Quincy, and more.    Java  -  "Based off of C/C++; fairly strong and creates Internet programs"  Same as C/C++    VB  -  "Lightly based off of C; very easy"  Microsoft Visual Studio.  VBS (Windows Visual Basic Script) can be written in Notepad, Notepad++.    HTML  -  "Easiest, Internet based"  Notepad, Notepad++, Nvu, Dreamweaver, and many others.      Note that C, C++, Java, and HTML are cross-platform meaning you can create it in Windows, finish it in Mac, and run it on Linux (if you had to).  It runs on all of the Operating Systems.    Good luck!|`|DxQ5QEkzaa	The way I started out programming was by making webpages. It can all be done in notepad. First simple HTML, then Javascript. You can learn these at www.w3schools.com     My interest kept me going. Before too long I took a Visual Basic class at my high school. I don't suggest Visual Basic for personal reasons (I can't stand how verbose it is), but I do suggest C  (pronounced C Sharp). I learned Java in school and learned C  during some on the job training so I'm not sure of any good websites to teach you. I do have a few books for C  as PDFs, if you're interested, message me with your email and I'll send it to you.    In advance, if you want to write C  or Visual Basic (VB) code, then you should download the express edition for the language you want to work with. Express edition simply means that it's free and designed for one particular language, but it's still a strong IDE (Integrated Development Environment). If you really want to learn programming, I'll be glad to teach you. coreyog@gmail.com|`|OMQMogQqaa	There are different kinds of computer programming languages. Eg.Java, PHP, C , C, C++ , Visual Basic, ASP etc etc...    To write programs:  You need editor (eg. for Java you need eclipse or netbeans etc,  Visual Studio for C )    To run programs:  You can run programs in good editor like mentioned above itself.    If you want to do web programming:  Learn PHP or ASP or Java's JSP/Servlets    Try starting with : html and javascript because they could be written and run without editor and compilers.

H8bfXVChaa	Well can give you some tips on how you can come to think of it.    If you are going to start from scratch you will need to be low priced. do the consultation for free. As in trying to identify the problem. If it cannot be identified instantly then tell the "client" so and that you will need to look into this problem. If it takes a lot of your time (swapping hardware, installing software etc) then charge them a fee for diagnostics.     Always remember to keep the "Client" informed as what you are doing and going to do. give him suggestions like "There is a problem with your VGA card, you can get it done from a shop or I can do this for you", if he says you do it let him know "So whats the VGA card for? gaming, office work etc"... Go get some quotations and keep the "Client in control" so he has choices.... :))    I am not sure about the charge however to get an idea about this. Just walk into a shop casually and ask them how much they charge for things like that.... Then take an average and do it for a bit less sum.... :))))    All the best|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	50 bucks- to remove infection, 75- if you need to reinstall windows  50 bucks- to run computer maintence, like disk cleanup and so on  35- to reinstall windows  35- to backup date or create recovery cds  100-300- for replace hardware|`|2Ck0OLlDaa	It needs a better processor apparently...

Let them know how much the new part will cost before you buy it.|`|1mbUH5aUaa	For friends you should charge about $25 per hour of what it would take to do the repair if you fixed it right the first time. You can't charge for your learning curve. Parts should be charged at about 125%. IE a ten dollar part should be charged twelve fifty. These are "friend" prices. Commercial competitors would charge up to $75 per hr and 150% for parts.

Download the K-Lite codec pack from here:    http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_li...    and also download the DivX codec from here:    http://www.divx.com/en/downloads/postdow...

The K-Lite codec pack is probably one of the best and well known for containing most of the common codecs around today.      I hope this helps.
79800e8aa542061232982947981d2dffaa	Slightly better. I've had it for about 3/4 of a year now, and I think it's frozen on me once or twice. Never have I ever had the BSOD. I love the Aero interface, and little things like the improved 4.0 desktop search.    I believe the main thing people have a problem with is that it's virtually intolerable at 1 GB RAM or less, while XP ran on something like 100 MB. I agree. It's ridiculous. But I have 2 GB RAM and it works great and fine. Fast, too. Secondly, I don't know who invented the UAC (thing that asks you permission for anything), but that's easily disabled. Third is the suckly compatibility with anything made pre-2000, and most devices in general. But it just takes a little messing around, and it isn't a significant problem if all your stuff isn't out of date.    My advice? Don't get Vista. If you're upgrading, wait for Windows 7 to come out the end of this year/beginning of next, or better yet, download the Windows 7 Beta, which is free until it expires in August.

swGP6to9aa	For better security of ur system, u need three programs separately. 1. Antivirus 2. Antispyware 3. Firewall  I suggest u to use avira antivirus, spybot and windows firewall/ Zone Alarm. And get a regular update of everything.|`|tOCESHLYaa	Well Jake forget about avg free. It just lacks to many things. Avast free is good. Use it with firefox browser. You need a firewall if you are not using windows firewall. Comodo is good but when you install it you should only install the firewall and not the anti-virus program. One warning about comodo it does need you to spend some time learning how to use it to get the most out of it. You can also get SuperAntiSpyware and keep it off and use it as a on demand scanner. Just in case Avast misses something. Avira free is also strong but does not have anti-spyware protection. Comodo Internet security is free, but in a review i read it did not do very good in the anti-virus and anti-spyware tests.|`|11KAjY3Paa	Hello,    I would be careful downloading the free one's as I have been exposed to several viruses when doing so.  You want to research your spyware program a bit, making sure it will eliminate alot of the newer virsues/spyware and things of that sort.      The free one's are not always as effective and again, can cause more problems than you would like to have.    Hope This Helped!    Maria Angelozzi|`|eR3vBsJWaa	avg but i also like spybot search and destroy|`|bpM9C6m9aa	well try  http://www.emsisoft.com/en/ it is a good antispyware programme as a scanner(it doesn't have a web shield or a guard as avg and antivir but good one)  avg has a good one and sometimes its guard or resident shield is faster than avira but sometimes it doesn't detect every thing and sometimes detects files that are not a virus.  avira is a good one but not enough as it doesn't contain a web shield or something like that.i have all the pre mentiond on my computer and working fine.  good luck|`|X05mP4aBaa	if u want to ahttp://meshigk.com/security/spyware-guar... spyware virous u cheak yhis site ok i think u r wise

z0S8syYGaa	I'm assuming you're doing this for Moira's survival book quest...so you should have received the widget or whatever its called from moira.  the mainframe is at the very top of the building.  as long as you have the widget in your inventory you should just be able to walk up the the computer and install it.      NOTE: when you walk up to the computer, an option to install the widget won't appear and instead it will just say locked-average.  just activate it anyways (even if you don't have a 50 science skill) and then the option to install it will appear.    I hope this helps!

s0zyoyljaa	no, its the CPU power. just for making video, you dont really need a powerful video card. a cheap nvidia 8600 or 9600 can do the job|`|fCOq04lNaa	If you really want to render videos you should get a quad-core CPU before upgrading your card. Video editing is extremely CPU intensive and a Turion X2 won't do very well. Video editing is one of the things you really want a quad core for. For extremely serious rendering you want a workstation card like an Nvidia Quadro, but those are extremely overpriced. For video editing you|`|9XrGIirVaa	This is a joke, right? You're asking me??  You're a funny man, Mr Fox.|`|3LjMWownaa	look into workstation cards for rendering videos, they're pretty expensive though.  However if you like to play games, then a workstation card will make you suffer while playing games, as they're not meant for that.  An ordinary gaming video card would still help though.    Something along the lines of an Nvidia 9 series, or the gtx 2xx series would be some good gaming ones. I can't tell you the ATI side, I dont have any experience there.    edit: CPU's do help, but a workstation card helps ALOT more.  but if you're going with a normal video card, a CPU upgrade wouldn't be a bad idea.|`|ML8J3nDDaa	Its probably the RAM. You should have 2GB with XP (at least) and 3GB (at least) with Vista to do video editing/rendering. RAM is really cheap now. As for Cards, If you get anything above a standard Nvidia 8600, then it will certainly be the CPU that is slowing your computer Down. Upgrade the RAM first. (PS. the CPU is weak not "very good")

If the file is infect it will infect your computer, no matter in what form it came from where you downloaded it directly or if you e-mail it.    If you want to be safe pay for your music. Otherwise download stationripper, that is free and legal.

If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).

In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.

Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.

(see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings.

IuCT3TjGaa	Clean windows registry means faster PC performance. The registry is one of the most valuable sections of your PC. This is where important information and directories relating to installed software, hardware, temporary files downloaded from the Internet, created documents and folders, and other minor and minor applications are stored.    Over time, you install new programs, uninstalled unimportant programs, update software's, install new devices, download files from the web, etcetera, hence embarking all records in the registry system. This is normal, but it is not wise to leave it untouched. Once in a while, you have to check and remove files that are no longer in use to maintain the speed of your PC.    Cleaning the windows registry however is quite risky so these reminders might be a great help before you begin.    1. Before you clean the registry, be sure you really now how and what you are doing. If you are in doubt and just plain curious, you better consult a professional IT. This is for you and your computer's security.    2. It is very important to create a back up of all you files before cleaning the windows registry so if the worse thing happens, your files are safe.    3. Find a reliable registry cleaning software on the net. You can either download a free ware or purchase it. A good registry cleaning software is one that includes multiple features - defragmenter, PC scan, junk file remover, uninstaller, and RAM optimizer.

A 6200 is on onboard, you need an actual card if you want to play games. I suggest an 8800GT, you can get them for $100. You will most likely also need a bigger power supply, good ones go for $80. So around $200 for an upgrade that will play recent games on high.

What it sounds like to me is a bad case of too many shareware downloads (Smiley-Face Programs, Screensavers, Game Demos, Toolbars), music downloads (Anything from Limewire, Frostwire, Kazaa, Bit Torrent), and other downloads that install advertisements and viruses on your computer.  Here are the steps I recommend-  Gain access to an Administrator account.  Once there, click Start > Control Panel > Add or Remove Programs.  Begin to get rid of anything that looks like shareware (toolbars, screensavers, etc).  You probably don't need to delete your music.  Restart your computer.  If you don't have this program, download Adaware (free, lavasoft.com).  Do a scan for viruses and remove anything it finds.  Restart your computer again.  Continue deleting files you don't need, useless applications, anything that might slow your computer down.  If you still see no improvement, the best option would be to back up your documents and other important files, completely wipe your hard drive, and reinstall Windows XP.

The hard drive is likely 5400rpm, so that is slow as well. And it's quite likely the machine doesn't have a pci-express graphics card slot.    Buy a new PC.  If your 4GB of memory is 2 modules, I'd recommend you just buy any brand name PC on sale, maybe a simple Compaq, and take out the stock 2GB of memory, and install your 4GB of memory. (you could put the new PCs 2GB of memory in your old PC, and have a 2nd computer)    As far as U.S. dollars go.

I had to ask for help picking out one on the forums I mentioned cause I really didn't know what I was looking for.    The best deal for me, at the time, was a intel Q6600 quad core processor. I think I got it for 199 bucks or something.  I'm not sure what the prices are now.  The newer quad cores are out. Check out the prices on them and decide.    Pick up a decent dvd drive, monitor (i reccomend samsung), and a few other accesories and you should have a pretty solid PC.
f4NqQoYgaa	Ok, before you panic, try a System Restore on your computer. You can do this by going to Start > All Programs > Accessories > System Tools > System Restore. Pick the most recent date that is listed as a System Checkpoint. Follow the instructions as the wizards completes, and restarts your computer. This will reverse any configurations that may have occurred on your computer causing it to go haywire.    If this fails to do you justice, I'm afraid you may be out of luck. However, you can always try booting your computer into Safe Mode and looking at the Administrator account. If there is information there, it is possible your Documents and Settings folder was corrupted, but you may be able to salvage some information. You can do this by rebooting your computer, and holding down F8 until the Boot Screen for Windows XP appears and you select Safe Mode. Just wait until the Welcome Screen appears, including the Administrator Account (this will only work if you actually HAVE another account other than the Administrator, which most people do).     HOWEVER, before you try the above, follow the above directions until to get the the Windows XP boot screen. Instead of selecting Safe Mode, I would like you to select "Last Known Configuration Settings That Worked." It is imperative you do this before you try anything else because it is only good the first time. I would try this even before you do a System Restore.     If none of this works for you, I would try bringing your computer to a specialist to see what can be recovered from your hard-drive. However, this seems more like a configuration error, and I have faith in what I have told you above.     Good Luck!|`|vFHXrOHNaa	are you able to access the computer and are you using the same computer to ask this question?

TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings.

DxQ5QEkzaa	There is no such tool. You'll just have to learn to make CSS that works for both.    Problems that I've encountered that make a difference between FF and IE:    If you make any tag float, then make sure that you make any internal tags float the same direction.    Try not to use position: absolute. A lot of problems occur, try position: relative instead. Of course there are exceptions to this rule occasionally, but there's always a way to do it without using absolute.    Margins and paddings sometimes don't default to the same thing, or are missinterpreted by different browsers. The only way to properly have a margin and a padding is to place the tag inside a div. To give a "padding" make the internal tag's margin whatever you want the padding to be, to give a "margin" give the div the desired margin.    If you specify a size of a font or a width of a control, then make sure you specify the units. Such as px, em, or %. Some browsers may default to % while others default to px.    All in all, don't let the browser assume anything. Specify as much as you need to so that there's no room for the browser to interpret anything wrong.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	It's called "knowledge".

wUqeZl3Saa	You waited to long before doing something. Another possibility is the internet lagged and your connection timed out because it took to long to get there.    Servers have a limited number of connections. To help prevent errors and other problems from tying up all of those connections, they set a time limit on them. If you go past the limit with no activity, or no communication, you get a timed out error.    This is a normal event and the internet was more or less designed to crash and repair itself. Unfortunately, sometimes that crash forces you to log back in to what ever you were doing before the crash.    Shadow Wolf|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	On secured sites (like banks, ordering things, the SSL stuff) cookies set by the site to your machine have a 'TTL' (time to live) for the session, that keep the machine 'authenticated'.  It's a security thing so you don't forget to log out (which you should do from every site you "log in"  when yer' done) leaving your purchasing session still running...that way some one can't get into your account and buy more stuff or fiddle around with your account.  Tip: as your cruising around a buying site, put things into a holding area (some sites call it a 'wish list' or similar.  That way if you get interrupted, or timed out, they are saved in a file @ the store so you can just jump right back there and complete the purchase.
tOCESHLYaa	For some reason the anti-spyware programs cannot always remove Browser hijackers. I would guess that you are using Internet Explorer.  If your using IE the hijacker could be in your add- ons.Open IE, go to tools, then click on manage add-ons, then click on Enable or disable add-ons, next to Show it should read Add-ons currently loaded in Internet Explorer. If not change it to that. Now check the add-on list. Look for ones you don't recognize. Click on the ones you don't recognize or you know you didn't install.Then click on Disable for each one. Then click ok. If you turn off something you need you can always go back and enable them. For some reasons AV and anti- spyware can't always remove or disable some of these.  If this does not work and you are using a router let me know and I will tell you how to deal with that.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection.

10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	To have internet logins - there has to be a "Gateway" setup which will check, then validate the user, then connect that user.   There are several ways to do that.

Failing that, you could get some proxy server software like Wingate or Squid which will allow you to use the PC but ask you for a username and password when you try to connect to the internet.    The proxy runs on one PC and all the other PCs need to have their default gateway set to the IP address of the proxy.  People would still be able to just plug their own PC into the router and use the internet, or manually change the default gateway address back if they are tech savvy.    Check the cable modem's setup page because this may allow you to restrict which machnes can access it, in which case noone will be able to access the internet except through the proxy,

Other possibility is the power board in the monitor, there are capacitors on it also.  In either case the affected hardware will stop working soon if it hasn't already.|`|AA11947951	sounds like it is sparking could be power supply unplu and check it out!!!!|`|F1VoMcRvaa	Make sure nothing is in the.

Other than that, I guess it could be your monitor as well, if you have a CRT monitor and it is shorting out as well.    Did you smell an electrical odor? (Ozone, hot plastic, etc)?  If you did, I would be very cautious around the computer.

Hopefully this helps.|`|2b5f3b4b8d6812c5312a98bfb2a404ddaa	Maybe the drive is not working?  Do you have a "cable select" setting on the drive? I'd try that.

RZQnxoF1aa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|AA11947951	what a bummer|`|0N5sO3Efaa	this can be cause by toooooo many different reasons. all i can suggest is find a friend that knows a lot about computers. this is something that has to be seen in order to tell you what is causing the problem.

Set your record setting to line out and record everything you need. I've recorded live concerts on line using Audacity.     The bonus is that since Audacity is a sound editor you can cut out bits and pieces of the audio if you need to as well.    Hope that helps!
UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|9xi3B9W6aa	Hands down XPS 16. centrino 2, ddr3, 7200 rpm hdd, ddr3 gpu, all important for gaming.

I don't know a lot about Macs so I can't tell you if it's possible to use it on both. If you just want to use it with the XP computer then do this:    Try going into Administrative Tools under Control Panel and selecting Disk Management. See if you can select the drive here and format it. The NTFS file system is the best for XP.    There may very well exist a file system that will work on both, but if so I have no idea what it is.|`|3kZ1jkxaaa	Put your XP cd in a drive,Boot with F8 and select to boot from  cd.It will Format whatever hardrive you tell it to.

Now for the main part: You have Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM, rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.    TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):    A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.    Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.  b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory. For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use your "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (chances of spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) or if you already have a scanner, make sure its database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (no good).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|T3MBE8NCaa	try if this works:    1. press Ctrl + Alt + Delete together  2.

The best thing you can do is ..research.. just like in school! If you go to the newegg site and pick a product..look at the comments others have made. You will see were many people liked or disliked a product and why. You can look up some things under the "manufactures site" such as the manual (if your looking at a mother board) to see just how to go about putting it together and what to do first! You can look at QVL to get an idea of what RAM has been tested in that mother board etc. It is very rewarding to your ego to be able to say "I built that"! good luck

Secondly, the majority of viruses do much more than just screw things up - they gain access to your computer allowing someone else to utilise the processing power and network connections on your computer for their own use.  This can include turning the computer into a node on a file sharing network that provides bandwidth for illegally distributed content (and you wouldn't necessarily know about it) or they can monitor your actions to build up a profile of you (and sell that data to marketing companies which compile market statistics etc).  They can commit identity theft by logging keyboard input and sifting it for personal information.    Some people do it because they want to make a statement, or attack the security credibility of a piece of software of particular computer system.    Ultimately, it's all about money and/or power.

The "hacker" society was the first wave of intellectuals to hit the Internet and, by definition, a hacker is someone who attempts to gain computer knowledge by exploration, not to be confused with a "cracker" which is defined as someone who steals data, destroys files, etc.    And contrary to popular belief, not all "hacking" is evil like the first comment read.  I myself participate in what's called "ethical hacking" which I get paid by businesses like the Anti-Virus companies and even the Federal Government to hack their systems, find any flaws or back doors in their security, and attempt to resolve it.  And, unbeknown to the average computer user, a lot of viruses are already on your computer which actually defend you from other viruses.    I hope this helped you.|`|bAXGQ2tPaa	I'm not a hacker but here is why people do it. They want to make you pay money. Why do people steal things? Why do people break the law?

b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	Public IPs  An PUBLIC IP ADDRESSES is sometimes called the most valuable asset in the online world! That is a public IP address is like your house number online! It is the unique address which is give to your computer when it goes online. The public IPs cannot be used on local networks (LANs) and have to be bought from the Network Information Center or the NIC    Private IPs  So if I would like to setup a local network of two of my computer would I have to buy IPs? NO! THANKFULLY! There is something called the Private IPs that anyone can use for their local networks and they range from :    From 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 (Class A)  From 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 (Class B)  From 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 (Class C)    Private IPs cannot communicate on the internet, they are meant to be used on local networks and not for the internet. Whereas Public ips are UNIQUELY meant for usage ONLINE that is all the IPs other than range of above are UNIQUE to some organization for the other. As a small piece of advice I suggest that remember these ranges!    2)Class D IP addresses 224-239    3)Class E 240-254 are also reserved.    A lil' outlook to the Future- IPv6    IPv6 is the upcoming version of the IP protocol which is suppose to be fully implemented by the year 2010. The necessity of this new version is due to rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addressed. The major change in this address is that instead of a 32 Bit address it is now a 128 bit long Hexadecimal address!  128 Bits will mean that there will 2128 addresses! WOHoo! An estimate suggest that even if every square inch of this milky way is given IP addresses, still they will not be exhausted!    Example of an IPv6 Address :  2871:ab11:0:1724:0:567:1:1|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	basically, class A networks are like government and telecom networks using 10.20.2.2  .  .  .  .  to LAN networks using 192.168.xx.xxxx    your LAN IP is not the IP that your ISP has assigned, or else there would be a million people with 192.168.2.15.

If you have a fridge magnet on the side of your case then that is fine (I doubt you will notice any change to your HD while you own it).|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	In a heartbeat. If the magnet is strong enough, it will corrupt most of the data on the hard drive.|`|2vL8wOHZaa	Yes it can. Do your self a favor and don't try it. And don't do it  to any one else either. That's just Rude.|`|ngfqQJQkaa	On a laptop it will break the screen. On a normal computer it Might not break the hard drive but if you find a very strong magnet and wipe it over and over again it will get rid of all of the memory and all hope of restoring the data. So the answer is it depends how strong the magnet is and how long you keep it over the hard drive.|`|ijcHG42naa	yes it can, believe me, i had a laptop and i was playing with the magnet on the mouse area (the touch area of the mouse) and it ruined my hard drive because the hard itself is magnetic and i had to buy a new one... :s  .So don't take the risk and do the same or even on the case...|`|NNCPe415aa	Yes, your hard drive is an optical disk, the magnet pulls that disk in the wrong direction and won't spin properly.<br>  <br>  DO NOT put fridge magnets on your machine.
brx6G2iaaa	I would say Asus. They have really sturdy motherboards. And for hard drives, i prefer seagate.

Wl9G5rehaa	tough question...  Leave you  tag as is, but create a div as such:    Change the top and left to the number of pixels from the edge of your screen there is.|`|B4soiaTuaa	well, you can't do that with a basic HTML skills you have to be a pro.  I don't want to confuse you here about it.    You can write over your pictures from your computer,  go to paint, from the upper menus find "paste from"  choose your image, and add some text to it.  Go to file save as, and save it as a .GIF or .JPG file and its good to go.    If you need help my website, www.2-create-a-website.com is a free tutorial and tips website.|`|T7Apky52aa	In addition to what the others have said, you might have a look at z-indexing because that will allow you lay text on top of your picture without modifying your picture or the text at all.    Good luck!|`|aqJhF71Raa	There are a few different ways you can do it. I think the easiest would be to create a div with its background set to the image, and the content of the div as the text you want.    i.e.  Your Text    Replace width and height parameters with the size of the image. If you need to adjust the position of the text within the image, you can use another div (nested within the first) and adjust its position.  Note: If you have too much text, it will extend beyond the image so make sure the text is short enough to fit in the image.      Other options I can think of:  1. Similar to the DIV, use a table and set the background. Personally I think this is a worse solution since IE and FF don't render tables the same way.  2. Add the text to the image with something like photoshop. If you want the text to be select-able, this is a bad idea.  3. Place the image using an  tag, then float a DIV containing your text over it. This could be difficult since you will need to accurately determine the position of the DIV and it will probably be slightly different in FF and IE.

Xg8Tzjfraa	When you reinstall Windows, it will automatically delete ALL of the files on your computer no matter which disk you use.  Be Careful!    Make sure that you backup all of your necessary files before you reinstall.  You will also need to reinstall ALL your software after you install Windows, so make sure you have those disks.    Also, make sure that you have copies of all your device drivers before you reinstall Windows.  This is especially important for your network card.  If you do not have the drivers for your network card on disk, you will NOT be able to connect to the internet in order to download them.    If you can not even boot into Windows at the moment (making it impossible to backup your files), I recommend using a Linux LiveCD to gain access to your files (see http://www.ubuntu.com ).|`|rMs4WBfcaa	If it is for a full install you can do it, if it a restore you can't|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	You cannot install windows xp with a different disc, if it is oem (meaning if the disc came from a different computer).

sSEy6KYiaa	Your iBook should just find the Linksys - there is virtualy no setting up to do.     1) You do not need any software.    2) Start by clicking on the airport icon on the menu bar (you should have one -- it should look like a series of circular waves, on the right side by the time). Make sure it says Airport: On. Now see if the name of the Linksys router appears below where it says Airport: On. If it does, click on it, and you should either connect or be prompted for a password.    On the computer that's connected to the router, type in the IP address of the router in a web browser. Usually it is 192.168.0.1 so if you don't know, try that. You will be asked for a user name and password. If you don't know what that is, then get the installation guide from the Linksys box and it should tell you what it is by default.    Once you're in, the major change you may have to make is to set the router into the mode (may be called a "mixed" mode) in which both 802.11b and 802.11g devices can connect to it. If it's in the g-only mode, it will not allow the iBook G3 to connect.    If you don't have an airport icon in the menu bar, go to System Preferences (should be a white rectangular icon with an Apple logo in the dock), then select the Network Pane, and then click on the Assist Me button at the bottom and choose Assistant from the pop-up. That should help walk you through the process.

Guz2Hzd9aa	for every reason, the HD 4850. i have never owned an AMD in my life, but following the progression of nvidia cards, they're turning into inefficient dinosaurs. IMO nvidia's lineup died at the 9800GTX. Maybe when they go 55nm/45/32 they'll start to make fast, efficient cards again. but right now ATI has more stream processors, and MUCH more power for the money.    by the way, windows 7 comes with DX11 - i know neither card has this, but perhaps you could save some money by going with the HD 4850. Both run crysis great. I had a blast beating it on progressively lower settings (ultra high at beginning missions - then down to medium on finale) I have an 8800gt w/ a SLOW pd 2.8ghz.

I am thinking you would need to take apart & rewire your power button, which is lots of work, and if you do it wrong could fry your computer, or even electricute you or start an electrical fire.  Theoretically, you could put in a switch that closes when it receives a certain signal, like your TV does with a remote control, and wire that to another computer connected to your router, so that when you tell that computer to, it will send the signal.  It would be lots of work, and you might have to be handy with a soldering iron, but you could do it.

Then you'd need some electrical skills to rig a mouse cord to, say, a garage door opener sensor so that when it recieves a signal it mimics the double-click. Then whenever you use the garage door opener it will turn on.    Other than that, computers don't listen to network ports when powered down.|`|72zh5RsNaa	'Wake on LAN' allows a pc to be switched on from the network.  It works by sending a 'magic packet' across the network containing the MAC address of the PC to be woken up.    The fact that you have a wireless connection should not affect your ability to send this magic packet, particularly if both machines are on the same network (addresses starting with the first three sets of numbers the same).    Take a look on Google for Wake on LAN programs and you should be able to find something to suit you.

AA12034021	True X Mouse <a href="http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/nt/TXMouse/" rel="nofollow">http://fy.chalmers.se/~appro/nt/TXMouse/</a> will allow your Windows mouse to operate like an X-Windows (Unix) mouse (specifically, flavors of X-Windows like OpenWindows, that practice "focus follows mouse").<br>  <br>  The window with the "focus" (i.e. where you are typing) does not have to be the top most window.  The window that has the focus is whatever window your mouse cursor happens to be in at the time (known as "focus follows mouse", as opposed to the MS-Windows philosophy of "click to focus").  This allows you to click on a window, to put it in front, but type in another window, which is really useful when you are entering information in one window based on what you are reading in the other window.  MS-Windows just doesn't work well for this sort of thing (unless you use TXMouse).<br>  <br>  I prefer "focus follows mouse" myself, but to each his own...

2Ck0OLlDaa	Domain name is the thing you type into your web browser to go to a website... i.e. www.youtube.com |`|Cxtdh5qYaa	The main purpose of a domain name is to provide symbolic representations, i.e., recognizable names, to mostly numerically addressed Internet resources. This abstraction allows any resource (e.g., website) to be moved to a different physical location in the address topology of the network, globally or locally in an intranet, in effect changing the IP address. This translation from domain names to IP addresses (and vice verse) is accomplished with the global facilities of Domain Name System (DNS).    Basically domain name is used on the Internet's Domain Name System. The TLD is currently operated by VeriSign. Registrations are processed via accredited registrars and internationalized domain names are also accepted.    My personal favorite registrar is PapaTiger.com|`|3DXXk2ukaa	it is basically like the website url without a domain name no one can get to your website because they would not have a domain name to enter yahoo.com is a domain name

brx6G2iaaa	For athlon processor its a very good CPU, as it has internal over clocking system. Also it has hybrid graphics of Nvidia. So i guess, it will make a good mother board. However, it does not have PCI 2.0 graphics slot.  So when you buy your graphics card, make sure its PCI express which is within X16. Good luck assembling:)|`|Q32FbbeFaa	not that good
bf258b1caa25f5429ae21799d6ad554daa	This computer is compatible and everything, but to be honest I think you are going a little too cheap.  My first build was about a year ago and i spent about $600 and everything still works fine to this day.     Also, go with AMD instead of Intel. Especially if you want to use the computer for gaming. You can get a very good quad core 2.5 ghz for only $150.  This will end up saving you money down the road, as you wont need to have an upgrade for a few years. Also AMD motherboards are cheaper for the quality.     The one thing you are missing from your list is a graphics card. If you want to game at all, even older games, you will need one. I suggest the Nvidia 9800 gt or 8800 gt. You can find these for around $125.    Only 1/2 gb of ram is way to low. Get at least 2 gb. They are only about $25 and really what makes a computer move faster.     If you have any more questions e-mail me at iwillsurvive09@yahoo.com and i would be glad to answer|`|LMgNaQGQaa	Yeah that's fine. I would really look around newegg and buy a 2GB (2x1GB) for like 20 bucks or 4GB for 30. You'll notice an extreme difference. You're not going to get anywhere with 512MB and you've only got two slots to work with. But everything fits.    Seeing as it's a retail kit, the CPU will come with a basic fan and thermal paste.    Update: That 2GB stick is fine, but it will be slower than two 1GB sticks running in dual channel mode. I would recommend either of these two if you're on a budget.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    Update: If you are going to get two 2GB sticks, then definitely go with a dual channel kit. Here's a whole page of compatible sets.  http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductLis...|`|1CLazt8Taa	motherboard?|`|YlopMXlgaa	ok, it seems decent and should run smoothly, you have to get a cpu fan and thermal paste. remember to keep mobo on the antistatic bag when adding stuff to it until you'r ready to put it in the case.

Guz2Hzd9aa	70 is nothing to be TOO worried about. if it hits 80oC or above, i'd lower the overclock, or improve case cooling. By the way,  you could save a lot of money by purchasing a slightly more powerful 9600gt or 9800gt. Their cooling solutions will keep them under 60oC - priced at around $100.

jHuIwZl8aa	Briefly, the ASPI (Advanced SCSI Programmer's Interface) is a layer of software which manages communication between all kinds of software and your devices. For CD recording software to function well with CD recorders (including ATAPI / IDE recorders!), it is important that the ASPI layer be up to date. <br>  <br>  If you are using Roxio software such as Easy CD Creator, it will load the ASPI layer for you. Other CDR programs may also load Adaptec's ASPI layer. <br>  <br>  Do NOT install ASPI32.EXE with Win 2000, Windows ME, Easy CD Creator 4.x, or with Windows Media Player 7.0. If you have one of these applications (or OS), you will be using a different ASPI layer that will conflict with the one provided in this file." <br>  <br>  The easiest way to fix this is to go here,  try using Nero's ASPI32 driver (WNASPI32.DLL). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nu2.nu/aspi/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nu2.nu/aspi/</a>|`|a33d0fd65e042ec29017b6760ec64d2eaa	Answer to that depends very much on<br>  what operating system you are running.|`|GxofM7X0aa	Let's get back to basics here.  Leave what you have where you have it.  Your system is using Nero's ASPI driver.  There's nothing wrong with this.  If you are creating an audio CD, then look at your project settings (different between version of Nero as well as other CD writing softwares) and make sure that when the CD is "closed" upon completion; otherwise, the CD is in a state where you can still add more songs to it.  In short, you want to make sure your final burn closes the CD in order for it to be used in a car or home stereo.  It's a gamble as to if the CD can be read on a different computer from the one you wrote it with if the CD is not closed.  I have been a PC tech and programmer for over 25 years and this has always been an issue with burning CDs and DVDs.
GnNRiqHCaa	Try taking the drive out of the external enclosure - it could be that its the components on that which have gone - and hook it up to a PC using the SATA/IDE connector on it. If the PC can see the drive, then all you will need to do is get a new external enclosure - they're pretty cheap and easy to fit. Then, it should happily run from your laptop. If you find that the drive is making clicking and clunking noises, it's on its way out, and there isn't much you can do about that. If the drive is the problem, there are businesses that will retrieve data from a broken HDD, but these run into the hundreds/thousands of 's.

As, almost all models works on Windows XP professional (SP2 VERSION). Now, there are many USB web cams that doesn't accompany with the installation CD. But, there are few that have. So, fist make it sure, whether it has CD initially or not.     If it had and now you don't have it,you cannot use it just plugging it in your computer's USB port. But, if it is a webcam without installation CD, just plug it in the port and then start your messenger. Make some setting other wise it is ok.    It will run fine. But, as you have asked, its appear as if it must have installation cd.     So, make it sure and then start using it.    Regards,  Rajesh Chaudhary

AA12351337	If you are connected to the internet with a cable, the you probably don't.  You need to buy a router.  Then that will give you wifi access.  Cheap ones, like the one I have, can go for around 30 to 40 dollars.  I suppose you could steal it, if someone around you has a strong enough router to reach to your house.  Then they also have to have it unprotected.  If they have a password set, you can't use it.  But using someone else's internet connection without their knowledge is illegal.  If they notice that their internet connection is slower at certain time (when your using it), or they happen to check the computer's connected to their network, they can catch you.  I suggest buying the router.

0BOxZ5Ecaa	i have to agree with the rest you probably overwrote windows when you installed ubuntu. otherwise you would have a choice when you first turn your computer on to either use ubuntu or windows with windows being the default op sys. if you told ubuntu to take over the entire drive it might have overwritten your recovery partition as well. hopefully you have made a set of recovery disks when you first got your computer. and if you get the urge to try a linux distro ever again just run it live from the optical drive until you are comfortable with installing it on the hdd. and then i suggest using wubi and installing linux inside of windows just like any other progy. that way if you need to uninstall it for any reason you can do it from add and remove programs in control panel.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	If it's a fairly new computer, it'll have a recovery partition.  You may also have made restore disks, these work the same way.  To run this you usually have to boot up the computer holding F11 in the case of Packard Bell computers, F9 on some others, generally one of the function keys anyway.  You should have the option to attempt a non destructive repair of windows, which should succeed because all it needs to do is to rebuild the master boot record.  Once you've done that, you should then be able to boot into Windows.  Having got it going, either remove the Linux partitions from the drive and expand the Windows partition to fill the drive or delete it's folder if you installed it into a folder.  Of course, however, if you allowed the Ubuntu installer to repartition your hard drive then it's most likely erased all traces of Windows and your software.  Should that be the case, if it comes with a restore partition, like most PC's built in the last 2-3 years, you'll be able to get it to rebuild Windows but it'll be like when you bought the machine, all your other software and data will be gone.  If you repartitioned the drives and it doesn't have a recovery partition then you'll need a Windows installation disk.  The windows dvd also contains software to rebuild the MBR.  Another alternative would be to download VistaBootPRO, it's not a free program but I accidently found a link to a free download of it, so if you search you'll find one.  Of course you'll need to run this in a Windows environment, but there's also a version of the same program that runs in a DOS environment.  Download that and put it on a disk/memory stick/cd/floppy or somewhere easy to find (remember that DOS cannot read from a linux partition), download and make a DOS boot disk image, boot the machine and run that VistaBootPRO, it'll sort it out very easily if it can be done.  Despite the name it'll do the trick just as well for an XP based machine.|`|QEEweJUaaa	You did it wrong.     Formatting rewrites the entire filesystem. "Incompatible file formats" aren't an issue when formatting. When you install a fresh copy of Windows, you're overwriting the Linux filesystem (Ext3 or whatever) with the Windows filesystem (NTFS). One doesn't care about the other, because one is REPLACING the other.    Are you sure you're not using a Windows *update* disc? You need a full installation disc.|`|GnNRiqHCaa	Assuming that you didn't actually overwrite or format your windows installation when you installed Ubuntu, you can edit the GRUB so as you'll have the choice of booting into Windows or Ubuntu. But, I am pretty certain that the installation routine picks up existing OS installations, and automatically adds them into GRUB. Have a look over at http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/16701 to see how to edit and configure GRUB.     If you've overwritten your original Windows partition with the Ubuntu install, then sorry, but you've no way of getting whatever content was on there back unless you have a restore disk - but that'll default you back to the PC's "as new" state, not how it was before you installed Ubuntu.|`|5WWxMD5Saa	windows will be nakered now, NTLRD.exe will be corrupt, even if you got the loader sorted out, it wouldn't load now. This always happens with grub when you don't install grub to the same partition as linux, but to the MBR. you must set the bootflag to linux. Then grub boots windows and linux. I dont like ubuntu it is prone to errors with GUI install. i prefer text mode install, debian way. The only thing todo is re-install windows and then use bootpart to boot into linux. this source will sort out bootpart if you want to boot linux and windows, just change fedora for Ubuntu.|`|4733bdc050d9d2540e2bd17782783a5aaa	You don't you just never install it looool|`|3FWmTtLuaa	go to start->system->advanced->startup and recovery->settings and go to default operating system pull down menu and see if you have a choice of operating system.

A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

QUALITY/PROBLEMS  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.    Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.  http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...  http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...  http://www.appledefects.com/  http://www.mac-forums.com/forums/os-x-op...

I wouldn't recommend taking it apart to dry if you are inexperienced in the process. I would let it fully dry out  for a bare minimum of like five days to a week. Turning it on before it is fully dried out will most likely short the circuits.     Then turn it on. If it does not, I would try to send it to Apple. They notice water damage 80% of a time, so don't tell them and there could be a chance you can get it repaired. If the on/off switch would not work, and was the culprit, for instance.

It will assign them both IP's on the same network.  You will just have to configure the laptops to be on the same workgroup.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck HTH.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	Basically you are using the LAN side of the router to enable wireless linking to 2 different robots and presumably your pc.  <br>  <br>  This will work properly as you are only using the LAN side of the router.  Of course, there is no Internet access available but you don't need it.<br>  <br>  You may be better off assigning static LAN IP addresses to the robots.
75nbESJUaa	The most fun would be Java. The least fun would be C++. The screamer would be Python. Python excels at file manipulation and launching apps. Python would be more of the glue that binds the files to apps such as ImageMagick and then let ImageMagick convert formats. Or, Python could open binaries and use TextEditor to SaveAs...<br>  <br>  So, it would take some study. You have to familiarize yourself with python's dictionary function and its API to talk to the OS. The drawback to python is its custom install per platform and the widgets, getting them to layout correctly is a royal pain.<br>  <br>  If you go the C++ route, check out QT3 or QT4 from Trolltech (google it) fabulous widgets pre-built.

FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|6Xreht4Qaa	Try using a proxy ! There's new proxies every day on :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pr0xyblog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pr0xyblog.com</a><br>  <br>  Be sure to tell your friends, and post it to your myspace page or blog, so others can enjoy ;-)<br>  <br>  Happy Surfing !|`|jMRwXz3daa	Well.... yes and no. You can always try to go to a proxy website (search yahoo for "proxy  website" and take your pick). However, depending on how clever your school's blocking system is, they will eventually catch on to this. How soon these proxy sites are blocked usually will depend on how often they are used. If you use it a lot, within a couple of weeks it probably won't work anymore. Also, these sites can to mischievous and be a breeding ground for computer viruses.<br>  <br>  But like the person before me, blocking systems are there to protect the school's network including every students' personal information and grades that are stored on the network. Also, if you're caught on a proxy site or myspace, there will probably be hefty consequences for you. So really, you should probably play it safe and get on myspace at home<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|dOMzkQIraa	Go home, visit myspace from there...<br>  <br>  The blocking is done to protect you and the school's network.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i17/17a00901.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i17/17a009...</a>|`|PoJETtibaa	Try <a href="http://www.speedproxy.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedproxy.co.uk</a> :).

The difference between the two is complex, but think in terms of scale.  Contact management includes desktop tools like ACT or Goldmine where you have a list a contacts (similar to Outlook Contacts) and you can record, schedule and manage all of your contacts with these people – similar to the scheduling I think you are referring to.   <br>  <br>  CRM is typically larger scale and more customizable.  There are options for CRM where you pay by the user and do not have to buy and maintain a large software package – think Salesforce.com or Netsuite.  These applications are more industrial and can manage marketing campaigns, mailings, etc.  above and beyond the Contact Management and scheduling.  I am a big fan of Netsuite, but I am still vague on your needs.<br>  <br>  If you provide more info directly I'll be happy to point you in the right direction.

AA10139908	First the right answers - then the practical ones:<br>  1.  FTP or secure FTP<br>  2.  Put the file on a shared drive that both PC's can access and have them "pickup" the file<br>  3.  Find a hosting website like Rapidshare / Filecloud / etc. where you can upload the file, secure it wih a password and have it picked up / download by the PC user on the other end<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Now the practical way <br>  Instant Messaging.  Most of the IM programs have an option to "send a file".  I have sent very large files via this method with little issue - typically to India or the UK.<br>  <br>  If the file is not already compressed .avi/mp3/etc. then you should .zip it first to make it smaller - you can also password protect it when you compress it.|`|MmZOttE3aa	you can go to rapidshare.com and buy a premium account so that you can upload huge files. the other person in another country can download it via a link that you will be giving...|`|I4TLCFf7aa	Your best bet would be to use File Transfer Protocol, or FTP.

LMgNaQGQaa	I'm probably not going to be much help in solving the problem but I think I can tell you why it's happening.    Sometimes when you have a certain device plugged into your computer via USB it will have trouble waking up from sleep mode. For some reason the computer doesn't wake up all the USB ports. Because the keyboard and mouse are not active, the screen stays blank because it needs a click or a keystroke to come back on.    If you know what the BIOS is I'd recommend checking out all the settings to make sure nothing related to USB or Sleep mode looks fishy.|`|plccXIVSaa	maybe you Video card or the monitor its self.

2dkCdd3Yaa	Unfortunately if the system has Windows ME it does not have a built-in factory restore. To reinstall the OS you will need the disks that came with the computer.    If you have the disks for your system here is a link that explains how to perform the reinstall: http://support.dell.com/support/topics/g...     Since I am not sure what system you have you will want to get updated drivers for your system here: http://support.dell.com/     When you reinstall an OS make sure to have everything backed up to another drive or disk (any information that is not backed up will be lost). Please note the guide provided is basic (not exact to your system since I do not have the system model) and you will want to make sure that you have the proper drivers on a disk or USB key before doing the OS reinstall. Also any programs you have on the system will need to be reinstalled (Dell programs, your programs etc). Make sure you have the disks for the programs you want to install.      This is a bit more involved process than some of the new Dell computers have, but it can be done and will fix any software problems you are having.

IgniypLFaa	Sounds to me like you're looking for Internet Connection Sharing (aka ICS).. here are the steps to make this happen.      1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.  2. Click Network and Internet Connections.  3. Click Network Connections.  4. Right-click the connection that you use to connect to the Internet.   5. Click Properties.  6. Click the Advanced tab.  7. Under Internet Connection Sharing, select the Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection check box.  8. Click OK. You should receive the following message:   " When Internet Connection Sharing is enabled, your LAN adapter will be set to use IP address 192.168.0.1. Your computer may lose connectivity with other computers on your network if these other computers have static IP addresses, It is a good idea to set them to obtain their IP addresses automatically.

ja1NsNL1aa	Here's a way using images:    Give your table of rooms a field, call it PicFile, and enter the names of your layout files for the different rooms.    On the form, add an Image control, name it 'Image', and assign one of the layout files to the Picture property (it will disappear if you don't like a label with no text).    Now you need to create a macro, so in design view, select the form and then the Event tab on the property sheet, and click on On Current.    Click on the build button (three dots), select Code Builder and click OK    Add the following code to the macro stub that shows    Private Sub Form_Current()  ? Me.Image.Picture = [PicFile] ? ? ? ?   End Sub    Now, when you scroll through the records, the layout picture will change for each room: it will help to make all of the images the same size.    Hope that helps.

ML8J3nDDaa	I do exactly what the couple on tv does. I use an antenna to pick up 25+ HD tv stations, and if I miss a show, I simply watch it online. Too answer your questions, there really are no disadvantages if using a normal monitor; however yo will notice a quality difference from normal HD broadcast on a large TV (still very watchable though) On fox.com the online version of the show will be on the day after it was broadcast, and it is the same with many other stations. Also, commercials are usually 5X 10seconds per 1hr show. While extremely convenient, there are some things you need.   1) A decent broadband connection (DSL or Cable)  2) A fairly high download Cap from your internet service provider. Some are only 2GB per month (not good) while some are unlimited (perfect). Remember, while you are streaming, you are still downloading.   3) If you want to watch off Fox.com or any other american station website, you will need to live in america, or have an american ISP. for example, while I live in canada, this is possible for me because i have AOL)     Some other things: If you have an american ISP, then you can also watch your shows legally off HULU (hulu.com). This site has almost every show from every network. If you do not have an American ISP, you will need to find other, less legal, sources to watch streamed TV. A very good station for this is surfthechannel.com.    With the exeption of possibly needing to upgrading you internet package, you will not need to upgrade you computer to watch online TV.|`|79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	Those website often stream there episodes.

1cdsJ3lpaa	Well GTA recommends a Intel Core 2 Quad 2.4 Ghz at minimum so that would be a Q6600, so your looking for a Q6600 or better. If you want to go AMD going with a Phenom II 940 at $235 is the best bang for your buck on that side and on the Intel side the Q9400 at $229 is your best bang for your buck.

79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	No you can't. You must have an old processor.    SSE came out when Intel Pentium III, AMD Athlon XP, and AMD Duron processors came out and have be in all processors ever since.
BMConIedaa	Odds are, one of your case fans has gunked up with dust.  It happens.  Case fans are usually pretty cheap to replace.    To find out which is the offending fan, open it up, and use something thin like a pencil to push the fan blades.  They should move somewhat freely and "snap" into place when they lose momentum.  If they take more than a touch of effort to move, they'll need to be replaced.  Case fans are usually pretty cheap.    It's probably not the fan on your power supply - that would keep your computer from turning on.    If its your CPU fan, those aren't terribly easy to replace, but its not impossible.  Just make sure that your replacement CPU heatsink fits in your computer case, and that it is the right size for your CPU.    Opening up your case and vacuuming out the dust bunnies every couple of months will keep your fans running smoothly.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	If it is a clicking noise it is the HDD going bad|`|AA11947951	Could be hard drive, CD rom, or power supply unit one of the three.|`|qcTVHEulaa	no long speech, but it sounds like a cooling fan might be ready to take a dump|`|brx6G2iaaa	In your PC, noise comes only from certain resources. One would be your Cd/Dvd rom drive bay , hard disk or the cooling fan inside. So in your case, it should be your hard-drive or CPU cooling fan. However, I cant exactly tell which one has been failed or malfunctioning.    However, if the noise is like grinding , its definately from your hard-drive and you cant do anything about your hard-drive. You can only replace your hard-drive. In other case, if it is your CPU cooling fan, you can get a new one and replace it yourself. Its a simple task. Open up the case and check from which part the noise is coming from and then decide.     So if hard disk, go to computer shop as you need to install new OS, or you can replace your own hard-disk and do your windows installation yourself. And if thats cooling fan, just replace it. Its a childs play.|`|EmgiGg17aa	Most often, the fan makes a buzzing noise on and off meaning something is hitting the blades.  Easy fix.  If there is a clicking noise, the on/of switches are working overtime....searching, or there is a programming fault that is causing that.     You can reduce that by first going to My Computer/Cdrive /properties/and then disk cleanup.   Then after that is finished(you have to wait 5 minutes if it is NTFS) FAT goes faster in cleaning up.     After that is done because it will require you to restart the computer, go back to the same place but this time click on the "Tools" tab and then click on "check now" for errors and check off the 2 white boxes > you will have to restart your computer again.     Do that and the clicking should be less.   And it should restart faster.     To go deeper, download a free registry cleaner and let it do a registry check.   "Eusing Registry Cleaner" takes a little while but cleans everything it finds in one go.      Another registry cleaner I like but only use the "trial Version" which you can reuse again and again is Registry FirstAid  which will find alot of errors but only clean like10% a run, so you have it rescan and do it again(and again).     You will note that your computer runs faster and does not get stuck anymore.   The clicking noises will have died down.    Using programs such as Ad-Aware(by Lavasoft) which is free, will  help get rid of adware and spyware in your computer which makes it run slower.    Use the free version.  It does the complete job that the paid version would do.   And then uninstall it thru the "Add/remove programs" and then download and install "Spybot S&D" for it to look for other spyware.>>It and Ad-Aware do not like each other installed on at the same time.     By this time, you machine will have stopped its clicking and goes much faster than before.   Hopefully you are running a AntiVirus program 24/7 if you spend a lot of time on the net. or get alot of emails.       There are free ones out there, and free is better than nothing.    Just run ad-aware amd spybot once a month and you should be happy.    If it is dusty "do not use a vacuum cleaner"  It will short out your computer.   Static electricity.     Better bet is to use a straw and blow thru it with your mouth to blow out the dust without touching anything.  Also, don't spit.|`|f8m7gHkuaa	what type of noise....does it sound like the fan is hittign some cables, or is it a squeaky noise, or wat.|`|AA11347742	if its a lap top then put it on a hard surface like a table.    often if you use it on your lap or a soft/fabric surface for too long it over heats.
ML8J3nDDaa	Go intel.  There naming system is as follows. The E series (eg E8400) is standard dual core desktop. The higher the number, the better the performance.    The Q series is Quad core. Higher number is better.    The Core 2 Duo Extreme series have the best processors on the market. Look on intels website but beware a system with these processos will cost you big time (at least $1000 for only the processor + min $300 for a compatable motherboard).     PS. A 2.0 GHZ dual core core 2 duo will have better perforemance in most cases than a 3.2 GHz Pentium D dual core, so yes things have changed.|`|fCOq04lNaa	Times have really changed, as nowdays it's not the GHz, that matters, its the core microarchitecture, which influences the amount of instructions a CPU can do per clock. For example a 2.6GHz Core 2 Duo will outperform a 2.8GHz Pentium D because the Core 2 Duo can pump out more instructions per clock.  Basically to find performance you have to find CPU reviews and look at CPU charts. Generally architecture is hard to tell just by looking at it. The most powerful processor available today is Intel's Core i7 series. Then comes Core 2 and AMD's' Phenom IIs.|`|qcTVHEulaa	goto tigerdirect and check them out|`|AA12180741	that would be:  Intel Core2 Extreme QX9775 3.2GHz 12MB L2 Cache LGA 771 150W Quad-Core Processor  with a price tag american $1,549.99 each    so if you bought a dual cpu motherboard and had 2x of these that would be 8x3.2ghz = 25.6ghz|`|YlopMXlgaa	just google it. it is gonna cost you a bit though and i'm talking about $200 and up|`|brx6G2iaaa	http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...

W4dxeNx6aa	The firewall was a good setting to disable, and a good idea to have done.     Have you tried disabling the windows firewall? are you going through a router?     It seems to me as though your computer needs to be a little refreshed and i will assist you with doing so.     First thing you should do is open up internet explorer, press tools, press internet options, under browsing history it should have a delete button press it. now on the bottom of this page it has a delete all go ahead and delete everything from cookies to temp files etc.    now if that doesn't work do this. open up command prompt.  If you are running windows vista be sure to open it as administrator.     Now type:    netsh int ip reset iplog.txt            "hit enter"    netsh winsock reset catalog        "hit enter"    ipconfig /flushdns                        "hit enter"    now restart your computer.    If that doesnt work message me there are more options to go through.

Although I have seen some people use wireless cards instead of a wireless router to make a wireless network.    http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/4...|`|W4dxeNx6aa	Yes you can connect to the internet by hard wiring to the modem.     If you would like wireless capabilities in the future by a wireless router and hard wire that into the modem.    Hard wiring: taking an Ethernet/ cat 5 cord and plugging it directly into the modem from your computer.     Most modems only have one port on the back of it. If you would like to get more than one computer connected to the internet at a time your going to need to buy a router, it doesn't have to have wireless capabilities.      my suggestion "linksys"     If you have any questions please ask.|`|83vhCGW1aa	Yeah.  If the internet comes in from the wall, you run it to a regular modem for cable or dsl or whatever you're using, then into the server, then from the server to the computers, either wired or wirelessly.  If you are interested in high speed wireless internet thats affordable, check out Wimax from Clear.  It is only in Portland, Oregon right now but it will be coming to other cities soon.
eNPcNGSjaa	You should tell your mom that you have a Facebook and give her this woman's info.  I doubt your mom would get mad that you are using the same website as an old friend of hers.    Facebook and Myspace are two totally different things, and in my opinion, Facebook is a more reputable social networking website than Myspace.  And the way that Myspace is designed, it attracts more faux accounts and petifiles than Facebook.      Facebook at least makes a valid attempt to only allow real people join.

I think the power supply has been spoilt. So try getting a spare power supply unit and see whether your mother board works. If still cannot work, then your mother board is blown. Although I have 100% feeling that your power supply unit is failed, coz normally PSU has big resistors inside and will give you a charcoal smell. Hope it good day for u:)|`|72zh5RsNaa	The chips inside the PC heat up when they are used.  Their lifespan is reduced if they are run at a high temperature for too long, so they can malfunction or fail completely.    In answer to your question, yes the computer will still switch on if the fan breaks, but unless you can cool the components inside adequately the computer components could start to get damaged.    You could open the case and direct a domestic fan onto the motherboard to allow you to get the essentials off the machine but I would recommend replacing the fan as soon as you can.    If you are talking about the fan in the power supply, it may be the power supply that has broken.

You can consult your manual or the manufacturer for help in this as well as the process differs from router to router.    3.)

hdTJ5Lpnaa	try this, i think it will help you  in safe mode F8 run malwarebytes anti-malware and SUPERAntispyware,and what they find you  delete it manually. then run ccleaner to clean your pc, and mvregclean, to clean registry.  what mvregclean find you remove because the key is there but not the file ,folder or program.  even you reformat and it finds anything remove dont be afraid.  dont forget when you install this software to update them, and do an update every day  then restore until before you get infected.  m|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|tOCESHLYaa	If your using IE the hijacker could be in your add- ons.Open IE, go to tools, then click on manage add-ons, then click on Enable or disable add-ons, next to Show it should read Add-ons currently loaded in Internet Explorer. If not change it to that. Now check the add-on list. Look for ones you don't recognize. Click on the ones you don't recognize or you know you didn't install.Then click on Disable for each one. Then click ok. If you turn off something you need you can always go back and enable them. For some reasons AV and anti- spyware can't always remove or disable some of these. If this does not work and you are using a router you router could have been hijacked. All you have to do is reset your router. Push and hold the reset button in for 30 seconds.

You have an HP laptop :-p  2. No that would not be the monitor, monitor has nothing to do with that stuff.  3. Virus could have corrupted your OS (operating System), btw get Kaspersky anti-virus http://www.kaspersky.com/ (they are VERY good, better than anything AVG could offer and much much faster.  4. I have Vista, and sometimes it corrupts itself lmfao...... Thats why windows 7 is coming out...because vista is a pile of epic fail.    5. Unless you downloaded a beta driver then probably not.    I would recommend saving all your important files to an external, and doing a fresh install of Vista. If you don't have your Vista install Cd just call HP and explain the problem to them. They will more likely then not send you a new copy of Vista.    Also if you installed and questionable software, or anything that deals with the registry then you might want to do a system restore to a long time ago before any of that was run on your pc.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I have an hp laptop & mine turned black & would not go on so it was still under warrenty.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|TyKGJwlcaa	I would probably get a Dell.

Basically I would not recommend the purchase of an HP laptop over Dell, having used both. Getting your HP laptop repaired will be an enormous hassle. Dell makes the best Namebrand laptops on the Market if you pick your Model wisely. This basically means Don't but a Studio laptop. You're going to want and Inspiron or an XPS. XPS support is based in the US. Plan on spending 500+ For a well rounded laptop. You also have to take into consideration you're getting Vista with it, so make sure it's got about 4GB RAM, and a decent Videocard, Most XPS and Inspiron laptops have the option to Upgrade to a better GPU, I suggest doing it. Also for future reference, list your price range. And whatever you do, Don't buy a Gateway.|`|6594714b8deeef4517df131be9164157aa	As someone who does warranty work on Dell products, go with the exteneded warranty, like a 3 year.

If you are going to use the computer for graphics (photoshop) make sure you purchase a mid-range laptop with a good video card and have the maximum RAM installed.    In most populated centres (larger cities) Dell has a higher customer satisfaction rating for service.    Cons:    Both Dell and HP are proprietary - some software/hardware may have compatibility problems.    Dell has compatibility problems with certain Virus scanners.  If you call your ISP concerning their virus scanner, many times the first question they ask "Is it a Dell".  This is also the first question asked by some Virus Scanner developers.        Other than that, they both build decent laptops - make sure you purchase one suited for your needs.    Good Luck

or3H3VQ4aa	There are lots of ways to do this.  If this were a real world application I would suggest using a sorting algorithm (quicksort, bubble sort anything).  But here I think the basics will do.<br>  <br>  Think of it as a real world problem.  You have five people each with a number stamped on them.  You need to figure out which one has the largest number and then put him in the front.  How would you do that?<br>  <br>  Well first you need to compare each person's number to each other person.  We also need a way of keeping track of who made the most.  So lets assign a variable "GreedyBastard" as the person who makes the most.  Lets begin:<br>  <br>  int greedyBastard = 0; // We have to start somewhere.<br>  //Next we need to compare everyone.  We started with the first person //so lets compare him to number 2 (index == 1).<br>  <br>  if(sales[greedyBastard] < sales[1]){<br>     greedyBastard = 1;<br>  }<br>  // Checks to see if the current greedyBastard made less than the last //one.  If so then the guy who made more is the new greedyBastard.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now you can use this method and explicitly list out a section for each person aka <br>  sales[greedyBastard] < sales[2]<br>  sales[greedyBastard] < sales[3]... and so on<br>  <br>  But the better way would be to loop them.<br>  <br>  Note that this does NOT display more than one person.  So if TWO people made the same amount then the answer would only be partially correct.<br>  <br>  Last note, the code for this answer is far from optimal, I would suggest trying out several different comparison methods and decide what works best.|`|zGUfEvRdaa	Programming Tutorial And Project Help And <br>  Latest Jobs And Earn Money-<a href="http://techwebs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://techwebs.org/</a>

WmGcN14laa	You're going to have to provide more details than this.  I assume this is a test question, because I can't see how this would come up in real life.  A java.util.List has a perfectly good indexOf function.  And any real programmer would just use that.  If you want to roll your own you need to provide more info.  Are you trying to find an object in a List?  Or are you using a data structure of your own design?  What does the test question say?
hXHBm1BSaa	You are better to call the form again using an action of $_SERVER[PHP_SELF], this allows you to pass the post variables back to it, at the beginning use an if statement :  If ($_POST[Submit]){  $res = mysql_query (select * from usertable where username ='$_POST[login]' and pasword = 'MD5($_POST[password])' ",$conn);  if (mysql_num_rows($res) == 1){  header("Location: firstpage.php");  exit;  }  }  The above assumes a database connection  called $conn, and the user names and ENCRYPTED pasword in the usertable table.  Always store passwords encrypted, it prevents anyone reading them.  Store them as MD5 ($_POST[newpassword]) or wherever the password is changed or generated from. Using the same form allows it to drop to the login form on a failed user or password. Include a message in the failed section which can be shown "unknown user or incorrect password" would be the most basic.

C0M20I9Raa	Hi,    Yours is a ADSL modem.  Your internet connection is through the phone line.    In order that your phone line and internet can work hand in hand, you would need a microfilter for each phone socket other than your modem. This is a prevent interference from the phone line to your internet connect.    More information about microfilter can be found at http://www.getonlinebroadband.com/faqs/f...    You can only prevent people from using wireless mean to access the internet via your modem. You can't stop someone if they are using wired directly to your modem.    You can enable your wireless security measure at the modem configuration menu. Use any of the security feature and have an unique password (or key). Make sure your PCs are using the same security scheme and same password.    Some information about your modem can be found in  http://www.dslreports.com/faq/bellsouth/...    I hope I have answered your questions.|`|0Vpm9vHDaa	if your phone is a 2.4 gH it can kick off your wireless. that could be the problem|`|RKSabTNMaa	are u using a 2.4 ghrtz phone if so that may be the problem

Find where you can place your 360's IP into a DMZ zone, and type in the 360's IP.    This basically puts the 360 outside of any firewalls and protection.  But it works too.

The first virus released into "the wild" was probably the Pakistani virus which was added to pirated software sold to people in countries that extended copyright protection to computer software. At the time software copyrights were not enforced in Pakistan, and the software  pirates thought they were punishing Americans and Europeans for breaking their laws.      Some virus writers do it for the challenge, some do it for political reasons, and many do it for status. A few do it for money.

vij9lVbxaa	The main thing you should focus on with cooling is the CPU heatsink/fan. Depending on your budget, the Tuniq Tower or Zalman 9500 or 9700 (best) would work.  For OC'ing, just go slow, increasing the FSB, then multiplier, then voltage (depending on how high you want to go). Download a program  such as Everest for monitoring heat and run IntelBurnTest to see just how hot your CPU gets. If it gets above 75-80 C, shut your computer down and lower your overclocking settings.   Also, don't worry about the LEDs in fans. If you don't like them, either a) cut the power to the LEDs or b) buy fans without LEDs.    I've been overclocking since the days of AMD K6 - I know my stuff.|`|VYkKfCGZaa	Keep rasing the FSB slowly, look for a recommendation to what you should overclock it to. Be careful not to go over the limit. I don't know about the new i7's but for Core 2 Quad, I would overclock from 266 to 333. I personally stopped overclocking eversince the system froze when using all 4 cores.    Also please answer my question.|`|1CLazt8Taa	Overclocking is never really 100% safe.  Just find out the default speeds of your CPU and motherboard and increase it only slightly.  You'll have to do it in the BIOS so watch out if you change anything else.  Just google to see if anyone else has overclocked with your spec, or see if there's a guide including your hardware on the absolute limit.  All hardware will die soon, overclocking just speeds up the process.

If you're not there when al client calls, and someone else helps him, THEY have a new client, and you just lost one.    No one earns a decent living "sitting home having fun" - regardless of what people may tell you.  It may be an enjoyable job - I love web development, software design, solving problems - but it's still work, even though there are days I can sit on Yahoo for 7 out of 8 hours.  There are days I make a one-armed paperhanger look lazy.    Think of a job you'd look forward to going in for every day - and one you can make money on (mattress testing doesn't pay well).  Train for that.  As my father used to say, you'll work when you're young (learning) or you'll work when you're old (because you weren't trained for something when you were young) - but you WILL work.

83vhCGW1aa	In most places you can get cable internet through your cable television provider.  When you subscribe to the service, they have some kind of arrangement to hook you up with a cable modem, so that you can connect to the internet using cable, and they turn it on at their end, so that box can connect.  You will need to have an ethernet port on the back of your computer.    If you're computer can't get wireless because it doesn't have the right card, you may be able to get one, just as you would have to buy hardware to use cable internet access, most likely.  (Sometimes they rent it to you.)      I know a company called Clear that has high speed wireless, and you can just plug the card into your USB port of your computer.  It is very high speed.

Nqp4zjGSaa	If your drive is making too much noise lately while reading a CD that has just been inserted in the drive and even shacks you CPU at times, it might be due to a hardware malfunction or because the CDs that you have inserted are not recognized by the drive due to some scratches on the CD. <br>  <br>  However, some advanced CD writers have this problem because they burn CDs very quickly. Hence, the noise done can be quite loud. There are two simple ways to solve this issue: <br>  <br>  Solution 1: Reduce the speed of the burning process.<br>  <br>  Depending on the burning software that you have installed on your computer, you can set the speed below 52x. I would advice older computers to use a writing speed of 20x-40x to avoid any problems while burning your CDs. <br>  <br>  Solution 2: Download Nero Drive Speed<br>  <br>  You can also choose to download the Nero Drive Speed software that can handle this issue for you.|`|80005fbdaf900cca6e0546dde58bfcddaa	This is because your computer is probably not use to burning CD's.

If you choose the USB method this is the easiest as  windows 98 was the first microsoft OS to fully accept and use USB devices so setting up should be quite easy    the router which you purchase needs to plug into the phone line and be set up first on the newer computer most router have ethernet ports so you can still have a wired connection to the newer computer if you need or want it to be, follow the set up instructions on the router then set up the USB/PCI adaptor on the older computer and then search for available wireless networks *fingers crossed* it should work    hope this helps|`|ZeKnInbjaa	a wireless router and a wireless G USB Network Adapter.

QrhbTZyFaa	Google infrarecorder, and download/install it.     If you don't have DVD-Rs/DVD-RWs, go buy some. Add anything you want to keep to a compilation, but don't go over 4gbs(or however large your disc is), then burn it and take it out. Repeat this for everything you  want.    It doesn't always work for programs (sometimes it will), but for music/videos/documents and etc it does.    Do your system recover thing, go through the windows setup and install any drivers for hardware (like a printer).     Pop in your discs 1 at a time and copy and paste the files to the desired location on the computer.    It is quite time consuming though, so be patient.|`|NZxvybYUaa	You can get an external hard drive and save them there. But if you're doing the system recovery because of virus\malware problems, don't try to keep any program files, you'll probably end up re-infecting your system. System recovery should be a last resort, not a "quick fix 'cause my computer's messed up". While you're saving stuff, get a copy of DriverMax, (http://www.innovative-sol.com/drivermax/... and back up ALL your drivers - it'll save you a bunch of headaches later on.

It needs to be cleaned.|`|GxofM7X0aa	You could also have a smudge or line on the ADF's scanner glass.  When you use the ADF, it doesn't use the flatbed glass to scan but instead a smaller glass area.  If you open the top of your scanner showing the flatbed glass, then look to then end where the ADF feeds the paper.  You should see a smaller glass area.  This is the ADF scanning area.  Line up one of your ADF scanned pages with this ADF scanning area to easily find the smudged area.  Carefully clean the smudged area and try scanning another page to see if you have taken care of the problem.  I hope this helped.

Comedy clips always get high views.    or anything you like doing.. e.g. funny slideshow showing really funny pictures of like Jim Carrey,  making cute and funny animals slides, etc...    also...    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

odOEhDivaa	Sometimes, if the song is very new and YouTube has filters for that particular song, the audio for your video will be blocked and unheard. If the song is super old, or just has no filters for it, people will be able to view and enjoy it. If your video has a bunch of copyrighted content, it will be removed from YouTube, and will act as a strike towards your account. Since the song "Handlebars" is a part of the UniversalMusicGroup, it will most likely not be removed by YouTube, but there will be a link in your video description that will say your video is a part of the UniversalMusicGroup. I do not think there should be anything wrong with it.

You would also need a cross-assembler or C cross-compiler for your computer.    All of this depends on what kind of robot you are programming, and what CPU it uses.    If you have no programming experience at all, learn C (or C++) first, then take a class on Assembly programming language at your local Junior College.

72zh5RsNaa	If this is the IP address that your internet supplier is giving you, it is normal for this to change whenever your modem connects to them.  Your modem may be disconnecting after no activity or for other reasons.    Normally this is not an issue unless you need to connect to your PC remotely.  In this case you either need to ask your internet provider for a static IP address so that you get the same address whenever you connect to the internet, or you need to google for Dynamic DNS services.    Dynamic DNS is where you get a web address (such as Dave.mydns.com) which points to your IP address, which your PC updates whenever your IP address changes.    If your address is changing 6 times a day and you want to be able to connect to your PC remotely, you should look at your modem to see if it has an inactivity timeout causing it to disconnect.  Cable and ADSL modems can stay connected for days or even weeks at a time.|`|W4dxeNx6aa	Renew your ip address for what? please anymore information would help.|`|AA10095280	In your control panel, internet options, there is a way to enable auto IP address dectection

AA10016890	If you are talking about representing each of these 85 symbols as a string of bits (and you want all such bit strings to be the same length), then it is simply:    ceil(log_2(85)) = 7    because 2^7 = 128 but 2^6 is only 64 (you need *whole* bits).    This is pretty much what ASCII is.

You can uninstall this by going to start,control panel, and programs and features and finding your internet explorer and right click on it to uninstall it. (I am assuming you have vista but if you have XP it will be titled differently)Remember to do this after you get Mozilla though because you wont be able to access the internet if you uninstall internet explorer first.

However, if you are less  paranoid, just use the vista CD and   delete all the existing partitions, recreate and format them. There's no need to  continue the installation after the reboot after formatting.    However, if you wish to sell a fully-working machine, yes, you will have to reinstall the drivers.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|ML8J3nDDaa	Most new laptops at stores like bestbuy or futureshop, with the recession, are in this price catagory.

dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|uAOkRBA0aa	use malwarebytes first.    you can get malwarebytes here,   this is a direct download link so you should have no trouble getting it.  click on this link  and then select run.  http://www.malwarebytes.org/affiliates/2...  install it preferably to your desktop, update it, then run a full scan and delete everything it finds.    some viruses will disable it so  if malwarebytes will not startup   then go into the folder it is in and rename the mbam file to XXX   then double click on the file you just renamed to start it up.    after you have used malwarebytes then do this online scan.  to make sure you have nothing else hiding away.  http://www.bitdefender.com/scan8/ie.html  preferably in safe mode with networking.        ?|`|a1ymHaWAaa	your security should have removed it|`|2b5f3b4b8d6812c5312a98bfb2a404ddaa	This can be notoriously difficult.

wUqeZl3Saa	You need to get the source code and recompile it.    Decompilers may be able to take it apart, but then you would have to figure out what to patch and then edit the EXE file itself. In all the years I've been doing stuff with computers, I've never seen a decompiler that would decompile and then compile and still work. They invariably get things wrong.    For future programs, you might want to look at setting some flags as text data within the program. You could then search for and edit the data even after the program was compiled.    Shadow Wolf|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	You can't "decompile" a VB exe file into the source code - you have no symbols.  (Programs that claim to "decompile" the exe give you something you can kind of figure out program flow from, but you can't "recompile" that junk into a running program.  The last version of VB you could really decompile was VB3.)  The best you can do is patch the exe file - which means you have to a VERY good asm analyst.  If you're that good, it's MUCH easier to just write the program yourself.    (You can disassemble the exe with debug - which seems to be missing from Vista.)|`|ftAyBEHDaa	Basically you're asking to disassemble an exe. There is software for that but is not cheap.|`|HW1hAAuUaa	you need to buy a software  I used one of my friend's one he made me. You can try java or ebay

IuCT3TjGaa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.   I hope this helped.|`|czzcysQtaa	There could be a number of reasons.    There are multiple issues with hardware or software that could be a cause of the problem. Windows has an Event Viewer that will show you errors if its being logged.    If you want help, I used a group called PCLive for help. They also sell an Online Backup software item that can be used to save your data in case of complete computer failure.

AA11312040	This handy-dandy multi step process might help. You might not like these answers, but, sometimes you've got to accept concessions to close the deal.    - Prove Facebook is a "legitimate need." Start by explaining why you would like to begin using Facebook. "All of my friends are" is not a good start. "A club I'm in or my softball or soccer team at school started a Facebook group to communicate with each other" is a much better answer.     - Agree to transparency. Mom has reservations, rightfully so. Agree to allowing her to monitor your profile, friends, traffic, etc. as she sees fit, with the understanding that "might" go away eventually, if appropriate.     - Agree to privacy. You shouldn't have a public profile for all to see, it has to be private so that only your friends can find and communicate with you.    - Are any of your extended family members, i.e. cousins, etc. on Facebook? Its a really great tool for keeping in touch with people. Talking to a distant relative is the offer, with talking to your friends being the benefit.    Outside of that Facebook's own policy is that you must be 13 years or older - if you pass that test they seem to think its OK, so you've just got to convince the parents that it is.|`|GEyJMsaKaa	Well,how old are you??    If you are under 12,it probably isn't appropriate. I am 14 years old and have a facebook.But if you are 13 or older I don't think there is a problem.Your mother will warm up to you eventually.|`|sbeHyaCqaa	if u want someone to answer ur question u should tell how old u are?

If that is the case, you will need to use your router's wireless configuration setup to enable some kind of encryption on your connection and then reconfigure your Imac's wireless connection to connect using the encryption scheme and password you've configured.    If that all sounds like ancient Greek to you it may be that you need to enlist the help of a local tech-savvy friend or neighbourhood geek.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|GR9mmWxVaa	so hard to pick its your choice it doesnt matter who picks for you   the only thing that would matter is that you picked it yourself maybe a little more research will help you|`|S6K91CF7aa	Anything than Dell is better so go with the Sony one

vL2Ec50Yaa	There are a number of things that could cause this.    Here's what i would do:  Insert my O/S disk in the cd drive and boot to the CD.  Does it continue?  (Do not reinstall the O/S.  You could all it to continue and do a repair.  When you get to the dos prompt, type:  chkdsk /r   and hit enter, it will take a while depending on the size of your hard drive and how much space is being used, let it finish.  Note if it says something about bad sectors.  Remove the Cd and boot as usual.    You could try hitting the F8 key while it boots to go into 'safemode'.  If it will go into safe mode , then you have a bad driver, or maybe you're running more than one antispyware, or more than one firewall.  I have seen this exact situation happen before.    If you still can't diagnose the problem, you can contact me at gikstar@yahoo.com for more help.|`|1WaTRF3Caa	When Windows is booting up, repeatedly press F8.  You should come to a menu that asks you what you want to do.  Select "Safe Mode with Networking"  After safe mode boots (click yes, you want to work in safe mode), go on the internet and go to:    http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    Click download, download now.  The download should start, save it to C:\  Now, goto My computer, then double click on C:\    Find the program you just downloaded and MAKE SURE YOU RENAME IT!  You don't have to rename it to something special, just rename the install file (some spyware blocks this program from starting) to something else.  Now run the file and install.    After it is installed run the program and go to the update tab.  Update the program.  Then go back to the scanner tab and select "Perform full scan", Select all of your hard drives/partitions and click scan!  It will take awhile depending on your system, be patient.  After it is done running, remove all the stuff it found and your system will be clean from spyware and (most) viruses.  Reboot and see if it's fixed.    If you still have the black sign-in screen, I would try the "system restore" feature in safe mode.  It can be found in the start menu under Programs>Accessories>System Tools.  Restore to a time before this started happening (be warned though that all programs that were installed after the restore point was created will be gone).    If that still doesn't help, then when you first turn your computer on (with-in the first 2 seconds) it will have a button you can press to load the system restore (most, not all computers have this).  Load up the system restore and goto advanced options.  Do a FRESH/Destructive install of windows (this will delete everything on C: !!!), this will take awhile, but once it's done you will have (basically) a brand new computer.  Be sure once windows is installed that you immediately download and install Firefox  -  www.getfirefox.com    Also download Spybot: Search & Destroy  - www.safer-networking.org  Install spybot and update it.  Apply immunizations and you should be protected against most spyware.    Good Luck!|`|7fd15b7507af7da3c6ae3fb710bbdd1aaa	Perhaps you should try to boot up in Safe Mode and then run both an antivirus scan, as well as an antispyware scan.    If you need a free antivirus program, you may want to try using AVG, which can be downloaded from the link below.    http://Grisoft.com    If you need a free antispyware program, you may want to try using AdAware, which can be downloaded from the link below.    http://LavaSoft.com    Good luck and I hope I helped you!

2SSA9e9Naa	Yes because users can be too set in the way it should be and not really know or appreciate the options that are available. I've been on many a project where the user tries to control too much and the end up with a very limited design.<br>  <br>  You need to take their input in terms of requirements, and get their feedback on the prototypes. But engaging them along the way can be too distracting. In designs, the customer is not always right.|`|AA12271834	It depends on your business structure and design methodology.  If you using a waterfall methodology, then user involvement will put you behind schedule and the end product will probably not be very good.  <br>  <br>  If the users want to be involved in the designing of the project I would suggest going to an Agile methodology.  Reduce your development to 1-2 week iterations.  At the end of each iteration you would go to the end user and have them try out the product (letting them know it is not finished but you need their input).  Any concerns will be rewritten as change requests and given a priority.  All the priorities are prioritized and the next iteration starts (start programming the most important priorities first).  Repeat till the program is done.|`|4CWxppm3aa	No. Of course, it depends on what you mean by "too much". <br>  <br>  A lot of programmers think that since they are "gurus" that whatever they do is great. Unfortunately, that's just not the case - it's a case where "beauty is in the eyes of the beholder" applies.<br>  <br>  "Interface design" by definition is based on successfully designing an interface that is usable, flows properly and succeeds in allowing the user to achieve the goal the interface was designed for, in the most efficient, straightforward and easy manner.<br>  <br>  So you really must have a good understanding of the "stake holders" of what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Obviously decisions are made in the end, and yes, you will never be able to design an interface that "everybody" loves. But the success of the interface is in fact based on what that ratio is (how many do love it vs. those that don't).|`|KHSOVxViaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Too much of anything is a problem.<br>  <br>  Particularly in UI design, many users don't understand the technical issues, and can want the impossible.  Furthermore, what one user wants may be incompatible with the wants of another user.<br>  <br>  It's up to the developer and project manager to cut through that and find the best solution.|`|Y8ndHCQ0aa	No!<br>  <br>  First you should listen to what people say about there "old" ui, and see where they work ( Bright light, dark? answering questions from users while they use a computer and so on) Then you should change the ui to it. And the best thing a use could be use for is: Test, test and retest with them ;) And user must accept the ui, so it should be visual appearance to them|`|9kfjIRLyaa	Its good to give users a little say. You know they are controlling the design too much when you have no say.|`|iYiEFBOUaa	"Too much" of anything is a problem. However, as you may have guessed, there is a balance. If you involve the users too much, it may delay your project. If you don't involve them at all, then the users may not like your product and end up not using it.<br>  <br>  When I develop something that involves UI, I'll do it all by myself (following GUI guidelines) and then present it to users for their input. If they have good suggestions, I will happily implement them. If they ask for something that is out of the ordinary, then I will politely mention that it will violate GUI guidelines and ask for second opinion. I will certainly not involve them through-out the development process.|`|tR2MisFTaa	it depends ... if you are designing a gui for a program that will be made available to a wider group and you have experience with gui's, then yes!<br>  <br>  if you are designing a gui for a program that only your customer will use, then no as he will want it the way it makes sense to him/her

Once that box pops up, click on the "Startup" tab.  There you will see a list of all the programs that start up when Windows starts.  If you notice lots of programs on that list that you know you dont need to start up EVERY time you start windows, uncheck the little box next to the name. For example, a lot of people have all sorts of messengers starting up like AIM or MSN or Yahoo etc, iTunes mite me on the list.. whatever. Third, you should run the "Disk Cleanup" and "Disk Defragmenter" utilities. You can find them by clicking "Start, All Programs, Accessories, System Tools".  Those two programs will definitely help improve your system performance a bit.  Another program I like having on my computer is "Advanced SystemCare". you can find it on download.com and typing in "Advanced SystemCare" in the search box.

4MYWPD9Yaa	Wine is a hack. It's reverse engineered and always playing catch-up. There's no way Wine is ever going to be a full Windows replacement. It's a great project, but as long as people are reliant on Windows-only software, they're going to use Windows. I know plenty of Windows users who won't switch to Mac even, let alone Linux, because of Windows-only applications.<br>  <br>  "Contacting" developers and manufacturers does pretty much nothing. People need to vote with their wallets. If you want Linux distros to succeed as consumer operating systems, you need to buy Linux preinstalled (instead of buying Windows preinstalled and then installing Linux yourself) and then buy hardware peripherals from only those who support Linux (Intel, yes; Broadcom, no).<br>  <br>  As soon as manufacturers and companies see "Hey, supporting Linux makes us money," they will support Linux more, and then computer users will see more support and move over, and then there will be more users.|`|dOMzkQIraa	Why run Linux if you're going to use WINE anyway?<br>  <br>  IMO we need more linux native compatible software.<br>  <br>  Also Linux needs to get their act together, there are 1000s of linux distributions and they all suffer from the same, it's a mess. Things get installed everywhere, there's no standard.<br>  <br>  Linux is not an OS, it's a kernel and a collection of tools and utilities. Nothing more, nothing less.|`|UJWOp88Qaa	It just needs to be sold preinstalled on more computers.  I think the phrase "low-end" is rather meaningless given the power of even "low-end" computers nowadays.<br>  <br>  If apple doesn't have to develop wine, why should Linux need to develop wine?|`|PdmaKwhNaa	i think it need to change name to windows lol|`|VbP8YWonaa	I use Linux, played with over 150 different open source versions. One down fall is vendor support for the use of wireless connections and software that looks similar to what you can buy and download for Windows and Mac computers. The software issue is one area it really needs to develop on (take a look at Mac Software, it makes the computer). Gimp is one graphics program that needs everything Integrated into only one screen and not a lot of different boxes. Wine really isn't an issue because I dual boot to which ever system I want to use. I don't have a need to jump back and forth between two different operating systems.<br>  <br>  Will Linux ever replace Windows or Mac, not likely for quite some time. The funny thing is there is all kinds of money to be made developing software for Linux, it is almost an untapped resource.<br>  Linux is good for server computers that don't require a desktop type of environment to operate and function.
wcS84lBGaa	do you have a budget? do you know html and how to edit/create graphics?|`|JSGJ8nV2aa	It depends how confident you are in your own designs and skillset. If you don't know much about web design, or feel that you need to hire someone to get an edge over the rest of the competition, then yes.     I'd recommend not going for one of those "lowest bid" sites, like rentacoder.com (if you have ever been tempted). Generally, through them you'll get poor quality work and limited, if any, support.    Especially for Logo design, it's an area where experience and a keen eye will win out over the crowd. If you're willing to pay for it, you'll get a logo and/or brand which will secure your position in the marketplace.    Essentially, the answer to your question is "Yes, if you want a guarantee of quality"    (And, further to a point raised above - _Always_ ask for a vector based logo to be provided to you. Reason being: You'll be able to resize it to whatever dimensions you require, without losing any quality, and it gives you the maximum quality for your cash)    Robin  http://www.solarisedesign.co.uk

AygEpMMaaa	For your eyes only: Shop, browse and work online with confidence.<br>  Are you the master of your own clicks? You can tell a lot about a person through the web sites they visit. Which is probably why web site operators and providers are eager to track visitor’s surfing habits. The fact is, most web sites create visitors profiles or (without you knowing it) install tracking software on your computer that captures statistical data about you.

Up1df6Kbaa	Well ... it's best to have videos that people would be interested in.  Make sure you have a lot of *tags* so when people use the search, your video will come up. If you have no tags, then it won't be shown in a lot of results.  You can edit these in your video preferences. It's really the only way to get a lot of hits from YouTube itself.  Otherwise, link your videos to other websites you use, so then people will be directed to it. You can draw a lot of people this way.  Good luck :)|`|d5989b135b6b0fe620f1b1d3a6d3d619aa	http://youtube-answers.blogspot.com/2008...|`|AA11629848	Beside adding a million different tags, you can link them as video responses to very popular videos.|`|yfi5iB7Zaa	suscribers.... also make sure your videos have some *possas *  something that will interest the average viewer

4MYWPD9Yaa	Usually when people say "free software," they mean "cost-free," as in you don't have to pay any money for it.<br>  <br>  "Open source" refers to software that has a free license of some kind, meaning that the programming source is available to see, modify, and then redistribute. <br>  <br>  So if I'm a programmer (I'm not, but let's just say I am) and see a program that could use some improvement, but the person who made that program doesn't want to make that improvement, then...<br>  <br>  1) If it's open source software, I can make the improvement anyway and then re-release the modified software under a new name.<br>  <br>  2) If it's closed source software, I can't do anything.<br>  <br>  Most open source software is also cost-free, but it doesn't have to be necessarily. Since the source code is available, though, it can be difficult to charge a lot of money for compiled binaries of the open source programs, though.|`|AA12271834	There are three catagories of "free" software:<br>  Freeware: This is software that is given away at no cost but you can not make changes to the software.  This is common for demo software or cheap games (warning this type of "free" software usually has a high level of malware attached to it).<br>  <br>  Free Software: This is software that is promoted by the Free Software Federations and is protected under their 4 rules (You can use the software any way you want, You can share the software with your friends, You can change the source code of the software to your liking, and You can publish those changes for others).  Free Software is more of a philosophy then a type of software.  Think Freedom rather then Free.<br>  <br>  Open Source: Came out of the Free Software movement but wanted to make software that was business friendly as well.  As a result it is more of a method of distributing high quality software that benefits both the end user and the business (Firefox is a big example of this methodology).  Open Source software is given away at minimal to no cost to the end user but there are usually service agreements you can buy to maintain the software (This is how Linux companies make money).  The biggest advantage Open Source software has is there isn't any malware in the code (if there was someone would remove it and publish the fix so that the project didn't have the malware any more).|`|CpHMmd2haa	the same as the difference between free-libre and free-gratis.  In open source there is an overlap.  Free-libre comes from the fact that the source is available.  This means that an end user doesn't have to be satisfied with canned applications that doesn't fit his business practice, or in other words he can have the applications changed to fit his business practice rather than him change his business practices to fit the applications.  There's is much more to it, of course.|`|VbP8YWonaa	Open source software is normally supported by the open source community and normally updated and improved on by that community. You don't have to pay for updates or keeping the program current.  Free software tends not to have much support when it comes to their programs.|`|9kfjIRLyaa	Open source software is free software in which not only is the application free, but the source code is to. Free software is just free, but the source code is not free.
d7ad08b207b33f53609b7f36506e5efdaa	AVG Free is ok, but not the best free anti-virus.<br>  <br>  Both Avast and Avira offer better protection.|`|1504ed0aa41d9367f9e3e5ec6d17284eaa	why don't u use search for questions this questions is getting out of hand to be answered everyday<br>  or use google|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Antivirus applications are useless and don't offer protection, because they operate retroactively instead of proactively.<br>  <br>  Think about it. If you were a virus writer, wouldn't the first thing you do be to test it against all the major antivirus applications to make sure it can get by those? And when you release your virus at 1:35 PM, how would the antivirus definitions have a definition for your virus at 1:35 PM exactly? Or even at 2:00 PM? There's no way.<br>  <br>  Apart from having outdated virus definitions, antivirus applications also try to guess what are viruses based on file attributes, and that just leads to a lot of false positives that get people into a panic over nothing ("I have tracking cookies? Oh no!") while also not getting all viruses either.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, antivirus is a waste of resources and even money if you spent money on it.<br>  <br>  If you want to protect your computer, here's what you should do, in this order:<br>  <br>  1. Back up your personal files.<br>  <br>  2. Reinstall Windows. That's the only way to know all the malware is gone.<br>  <br>  3. Set up and use almost exclusively a limited user account. Very few viruses target a limited user account, since they want to get their hooks into Windows' system files and registry, but even if they did somehow manage to compromise the limited user account, you could simply delete that account and start a new account instead of having to reinstall Windows to get rid of the infection.<br>  <br>  4. Google the term "social engineering" and read the first five results. Almost all malware infections rely on tricking the user, as opposed to exploiting security holes in the operating system.<br>  <br>  5. Do not download pirated software, music, or movies.<br>  <br>  6. Install Windows updates automatically.<br>  <br>  7. Use Firefox with the NoScript extension installed.<br>  <br>  8. Use strong passwords (no dictionary words, no numbers associated with you).<br>  <br>  If you do all that, you won't get infected, especially #3 and #4.|`|I4TLCFf7aa	All of the following anti virus programs are free for personal use.  <br>  <br>  AVG<br>  <br>  <a href="http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/5390/lng/us/tpl/v5#avg-anti-virus-free" rel="nofollow">http://free.grisoft.com/freeweb.php/doc/...</a>  <br>  <br>  Avast<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/free_virus_protectio.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/free_virus_prot...</a>  <br>  <br>  Avria <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Personal-Free-Antivirus/3000-2239_4-10322935.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe...</a>|`|HOq5Urn1aa	You can protect your computer very well with free programs. <br>  You should however not rely on just one program. <br>  <br>  <br>  Anti virus and firewall pro<br>  <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/download_firewall.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/d...</a><br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  in combination with<br>  <a href="http://www.pctools.com/firewall/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pctools.com/firewall/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Threatfire is an anti virus, that can be installed next to any other anti virus program on the same computer<br>  <a href="http://www.threatfire.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.threatfire.com/</a><br>  <br>  This is a very good program, that completely runs in the background<br>  <a href="http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.comodo.com/boclean/boclean.ht...</a>|`|AA10265922	www.download.com<br>  look for the 3rd most downloaded program  Avir-Antivus,it is a VERY good one|`|dEI55xwhaa	Avg - best free anti virus out there click this link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://free.avg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a><br>  <br>  May as well get anti spyware while your at it<br>  <br>  go here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a>|`|t7sUZQvFaa	I set up a blog that is dedicated to helping people like yourself!

I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.   I hope this helped.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Download and run spybot
i5QONmV5aa	You would have to be pretty tech savvy, but it is most certainly possible. The way it would have to be done is to break into someone's 802.11 wireless or perhaps even wired network, and just listen for cookies, which store passwords, logins, etc. A simple person could do it, but it would be mighty difficult, as you would have to use a Linux cored operating system, with the right tools. Most people use Backtrack 3 (www.remote-exploit.org). Most websites are very difficult to remotely hack, but if you get on someones LAN, and intercept cookies, it isn't very hard at all. Now, deleted messages are another story, unless you keylog the person, it would be difficult to regain said messages.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Yes, if someone is on your same network and knows how to use a packet-sniffer, then she has access to everything (all your passwords and accounts, everything you do online).    You'd better make sure only people you trust are on your network... or people who aren't that tech-savvy.    Oh, and don't use easy-to-guess passwords.|`|T7Apky52aa	It's as difficult or as hard as however much protection software the person has and how inexperienced they are on a computer.     Yes you have to be fairly smart to hack someone, computer or otherwise. If you're interested in this for purely research purposes, read Kevin Mitnik's book about social engineering.    It's a good think you don't want to because what you're describing is illegal. If you wanted to hack your own network to learn how to protect yourself nobody's going to care, but when you start talking about hacking other people to read their e-mail or hacking commercial site, the police and the feds tend to get real interested.    Hope that helps with what you wanted to know!|`|3LjMWownaa	Well, if you have a fairly good knowledge of computers, I suppose it would be quite simple.  There are plenty of programs out there that can do the work for you if you can get that program onto the users PC.    I guess it could be simple for the average user, if you know where to start.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i believe you have to be computer smart and know alot about the stuff that is how you do this. i know that if you are really good the FBI will get you.  This is something that is against the law and they are catching peopel all the time. the govt employs people to try and do this also to make sure they have secure sites. its somethign you dont' want to learn or even get close to. take care.|`|TsJoADGPaa	it all depends on the person your after or their computer. Some people do absolutely nothing in terms of security with their computers and can be seen and hacked very easily by someone who knows what they're doing.     There are many vulnerabilities in operating systems like Windows. Once one of these is discovered, a hacker can use it to gain control of another's computer. Companies like Microsoft try to keep up with patching all of the bugs, but many people don't update their machines and remain vulnerable.    So basically, some people who keep their computers updated and use antivirus, antimalware and a firewall. And don't open random email attachments or download strange activeX controls are very hard to hack.    While the stupid 40 something woman who has a hard time turning on the computer and has their email password set as "password" can be taken over very easily.    Same goes for myspace. If the password is something straight out of the dictionary, a password cracking program can crack it in no time.|`|fF4d2Bvfaa	You don't gotta be a genius you just gotta now what you are doing and what to do during different situations. Like trying to decrypt a hard drive is totally different from trying to hack someones myspace account so you don't have to be a genius but you gotta have knowledge about what your trying to do (whether it be modding hardware, software, etc).|`|PQWBoA2Baa	You really shouldn't hack someone's computer and you can get arrested for it. However there are sites that tell you how, so precede at your own risk.     http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to-hack/
sSEy6KYiaa	When you say access old purchased music, why are you looking in the iTunes Store? If its old and it s purchased that means it has already been downloaded.    if you need to de authourise the computer go to the File menu>store> deauthorise computer|`|h3K9lBDNaa	well have you tried logging out of itunes and re-logging back in?    and i think that u reached ur itunes music permission (which is set to 5 machines). if this is the problem, then u might have to wait until itunes has drm free. idk if this is out yet lol.
