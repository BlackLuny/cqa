dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	We eat at Chili's the most....its by the shopping center we shop at the most.......and I prefer chili's for good filling food but like Ruby Tuesdays when I want a good salad. Their bar is great!!!!!|`|AA11684189	I think Applebee's has the best tasting food and they are pretty cheap nowadays! I do love the Baked Potato Soup from Chili's though and their nachos, but that's about it :/ Applebee's I like just about everything on the menu.|`|u4liwDhAaa	Applebee's is great.  I love their spinach salad!!!  (And, on occasion I've been known to partake of a Long Island Ice Tea.)|`|GHd84xipaa	i eat at Applebee's the most,really like Ruby Tuesday for their salad bar and dry rub ribs.|`|vigFmfLmaa	My personal fav is Chile's b/c I love, love, love their chips, salsa and margaritas!!!  Applebees would be second b/c it's a great place to relax, eat and hang out with friends.  I've never gotten a bad meal at Ruby Tuesdays but the ones around here just haven't "caught on" yet.  There's hardly ever a crowd and the atmosphere is off somehow.  Never heard of Rain Forest Cafe.|`|nZmLycrXaa	Chili's always first, then Applebees. I used to like Ruby Tuesday but don't see them heavily advertise as much. Same w/ Rain Forest Cafe.<br>  <br>  Bennigan's is gone, but TGIF and Houlihan's are up there too as my faves.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Ruby Tuesdays...well until they took senora pasta off the menu! <br>  I hate applebees...rain forest cafe was way overpriced here in Philadelphia and the food mediocre....Never been to chile's.|`|h6RYrx8paa	Chilli's! i love their Monterey Chicken. Not so much on Ruby Tuesday anymore...all they really do anymore is burgers...Applebee's would be my 2nd choice. Never heard of Rain Forest Cafe.|`|1QURArm3aa	We eat Applebees the most...When on vacation i love to go to Rain Forest Cafe.We dont have them in ohio where i live.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	Applebees and Applebees.

JfVxCDb7aa	A bigger 99 cent menu !! and more locations!!!!!!!!!|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Burger King has the best burger by far!  Can't imagine how the other company got a better rating!|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	I don't really believe that McDonald's is rated higher in taste than Burger King.  The thing that would put BK on top is better marketing, and expansion of their company.  There is no one product that I could imagine would put them "on top."  I really don't think that BK is really looking for the value factor as much either as they have always stated their quality and "your way right away."  Dollar burgers just isn't their main thing.  Look at their menu and compare it to McDonald's...they are full of so many differances, and the quality is on BK's side.|`|V3HVvdyvaa	at our store we are working on a new burger i think it would  really change the itailian world  ....you can probably try the sandwich yourself<br>  it is 2 hamburger patties on an original chicken bun with marinara sauce and mozzarella cheese....it kind of taste like a meatball sandwich<br>  and if they changed the kids meal toys to something better <br>  and also go for adult collectables like they had 20 years ago..|`|TYGgRjqDaa	BK changed their french fries a few years ago.  They used to be just like McDonalds.  Now they're too thick.  I don't go there any more because of that.  BK burgers are tons better.<br>  McD might also have better kids meals.|`|AA12261142	hot dogs/chili dogs|`|4QHanq1Laa	mcdonalds is associated with many companys. for example, in canada Mcdonalds is highly affiliated with the NHL. because many canadians like hockey they will go to Mcdicks.. They often have hockey card/mini jerseys/goalie masks/ little nicknakcs for you to collect... <br>  Now if burger king used the same concept but used the NFL in all of thier American stores, i believe they would do better.|`|z7MPaUELaa	They need to bring back the mozzarella sticks.<br>  <br>  Better toys in the kids meals could help.<br>  <br>  Bigger selection on the dollar menu.<br>  <br>  More locations.|`|jsxphZJEaa	Better food, better everything, prices, nutrition, image|`|DR4LYQBtaa	Probably nothing will ever put Burger King on top of McDonald's|`|nS83ag9raa	only the roundhouse burger made exclusively by chuck norris could save it|`|ODvnyAdlaa	in my eyes birger king is on top. i think they should creat a dollar menu and have a better mascot :) xx|`|nZmLycrXaa	Bring back the Kenny Roger's roasted chicken|`|TufkjxfCaa	burger king might be a little healthier? idk i like mcdonalds better :)|`|Dx0CAHeiaa	the problem aint the food..its the price...bring the prices down

That includes all the places that are termed "Family dining", as they, too, have nothing but massively pre processed foods that are just thrown into fryers or onto grills for a quick heat-up.<br>  <br>  REAL food comes from either your own kitchen (not so easy if you're just traveling from Europe) or nicer restaurants...stay away from ALL chains if you want real food.<br>  <br>  On that note...I will occasionally splurge (diet, not money) for Sonic, and about once every two years or so, I might get a Big Mac, simply because they taste so good!  I like Subway, because it's freshER, and a bit less processed, but still, lots of additives that you really don't want.<br>  <br>  Personally HATE Wendy's...I worked there for a while...DEFINITELY NOT where you want to go!  Trust me!  <br>  <br>  If you happen to be on the East Coast and find a place called Friendly's (not nearly as wide-spread as the others, in spite of its age), check them out...get a fishamajig, a cup of chowder, and then have a sundae for dessert.  YUM!  The one I worked for has closed, and I haven't been in one for many a year!  TOTALLY saturated fats, and bad for you, but really tasty stuff!<br>  <br>  And for some chains that are also unhealthy, but pretty well-liked in our house:  Cracker Barrell, and Black Eyed Pea.|`|n5pMBQ0saa	Taco Bell - Mexican<br>  McDonald's - Burger Joint<br>  Long John Silvers - Fish n Chips<br>  Steak - n - Shake - Steak burger<br>  <br>  Have fun if you come over on Holiday!<br>  The food is addicting !|`|LKloPwz2aa	mcdonalds is a hart attact in a sandwich.taco bell aint that healthy eaither but its a gREat place to eat!i would suggest a crunchwrap supreme with extra meat. and wendys is GREAT!there burgers are awesome!|`|K8LTlBBJaa	I would say McDonalds is probably the safest, it pretty much tastes the same no matter where you go.<br>  I am Canadian and was just recently down in Southern California. I tried In'n'Out Burger. I thought it was discusting, so either it was just the branch I went to, or it really does suck. But we don't have that where I live so I thought I would give it a try.<br>  Just try different things, its not like fast food meals are expensive! <br>  But like I said, not impressed with InnOut Burger at all!|`|GunfpW1baa	SONIC DRIVE IN RESTAURANTS....YOU PULL UP- ORDER RIGHT THERE IN YOUR CAR...AVERAGE SERVICE TIME IS 3 MIN..

There food is great!|`|S6O1bDQKaa	McDonalds is the most popular but I think Sonic's is the best fast fod chain followed by Chik Filet or Taco Bell.|`|H6eU9Be2aa	Chick-fil-a <br>  They are pretty healthy, have the best chicken entries, and their desserts are GOOD!<br>  |`|5xxGwjsWaa	McDonalds- I love it! <br>  <br>  I want a Big Mac so bad right now. <br>  <br>  And yes, I am American- but not fat. 
VDpmh2VJaa	I would get cresent rolls and wrap salami and cheese and bake those w dipping sauces..you can also add hot dogs or vienna sausages with those..<br>  <br>  warm chili?<br>  those little sausage in crock pot w barb q sauce?you just pour them in crock pot and add barb q..<br>  there are great ideas on kraft.com<br>  <br>  get a little crock pot melt velveeta cheese and cook hot sausage and have cheese sausage dip for tostitos.|`|9f81a7341f8ed89dc9c6d39f49022e82aa	the turkey one is delicious and it is warm by the time you get to the table to eat.|`|OtI4tviYaa	No,<br>    They are BARELY warm when you get them right from Quiznos, so if you wait they will be kind of warm at best,<br>  <br>  Also, I like Quizno's and all, but it is EXPENSIVE, so I would think about something else, like chineese or something that will stay hot, and not cost a thousand bucks.|`|RfDoYHkZaa	i don't know about hot but they are luke warm. wouldn't surprise me if the get cold quick though.
O5cpVDjFaa	If you want something moderately upscale check out Il Posto, located at the corner of Northwestern Highway and Franklin Rd. in Southfield. The food is amazing AND the chef has cooked for many famous people and people from the UN. They also have another restaurant in the same parking lot called Pi. Check out their website! <a href="http://www.piofsouthfield.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.piofsouthfield.com</a> <br>  <br>  Oh and Il Posto was also named Best Detroit Restaurant a few years in a row. Don't miss out!|`|BevylvVSaa	Jeremy in Keego Harbor. It won't break the bank, but it is a warm romantic place for dinner. I've never been disappointed ever.  Want to go a bit father and spend a bit more?  5 Lakes Grill in Milford.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Indian cuisine. Yum!|`|CvTINWb1aa	Happy Birthday!<br>  <br>  My birthday was last month.  My fiance took me to Seldom Blues.  I loved the ambiance and atmosphere and they play live jazz music.  Oh yeah.  This is not in Detroit, it is in Wyandotte.  The restaurant is called Portofinos.  He took me there just because and I loved it!  They serve perfect portions of food in my opinion and you can sit by the water and watch the boats go by.  The scenery is beautiful if you are into that kind of thing like I am.  The salmon was excellent.  I hope you have an excellent birthday!|`|QiqNk7oGaa	Ike's in Sterling Heights, PF Chang's at Somerset in Troy <br>  <br>  I like those two and they are moderately priced. Also check on Hall Road in Sterling Heights because you have like 30 different restaurants to choose from.|`|uLDe67S9aa	www.mitchellsfishmarket.com/<br>  <br>  Mitchells fish market in Rochester?|`|BKJt0k6Eaa	Greektown is great.  Be prepared to spend a lot on food and parking though.|`|iMx4pSxcaa	ok for nice but not too expensive, the tin fish on hall road, any andiamos, fishbones in st clair shores and greektown, sinbads and the roostertail in  detroit, or if you want price upscale theres seldom blues the nice restaurant on the top floor of the renesance center.|`|ca0fe91273540adf6cee1f7fe6685112aa	I suggest greek town in downtown Detroit! If you don't like greek food there are many options downtown inside the Renaissance Center at the very top there used to be a restaurant that revolves while you eat (you don't feel it) very very nice!! |`|WxDyBG67aa	HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!<br>  <br>  Larco's in Troy.<br>  Traffic Jam & Snug in Detroit by WSU<br>  Roma Cafe in Eastern Market, Detroit<br>  <br>  |`|yCJQsbS8aa	The new Andiamo in Sterling Heights (on M-59) is fantastic.

a868587e0ef2acc8cd4b04515fbb86c8aa	I don't really know food prices in the US but here a normal meal cost's about 10‚Ç¨ & Thai, or Indian or Chinese food is about 20‚Ç¨ A head & it's just the Meal Desert & a soft drink... - If anything I'd of said 11.99$ is too little =) <br>  <br>  but as long as the taste is good people won't really care about the price|`|dSX9hZedaa	your link doesn't work. as for your price, this all depends on what type of economic neighborhood you're located in. for some $11.99 is very  expensive, for others, it's mere change.
egSK30E4aa	The crispy honey chicken is the best thing on the menu, though it's all really good!  You should all order something different and share.  That's what my 2 GF's and I do when we go.  Drinks...the Key Lime Martini!!!!!!!  |`|aohKqXraaa	Yes, it's delicious.. get the Lettuce Wraps, Won Ton Soup, and Shrimp Fried Rice!!! |`|0GIEZGY6aa	Nearly everyone orders the lettuce wraps.  I would suggest everyone orders a different dish and you all share so you get to try a bunch of different items.  My favorites are the Mongolian Beef, Changs Spicy Chicken, and the Crispy Honey Chicken.  I don't like seafood so I can't personally comment on those dishes (but I've heard they're good from my family).  There are only a few dishes I didn't care for- the Beef with Brocolli (not that special or unique) and the dish with Chicken and Peanuts- I forget the name of it- but it was way too salty for me.  Have a great meal!|`|9nHqFQIzaa	well ive eaten and pei wei its founded by pf changs and it has identical foods i would try the lettuce wrap for an appetizer though|`|TdkLUlXDaa	Hard to say - it's ALL good.
