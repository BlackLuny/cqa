BTI0XOptaa	It is true that Lice prefer clean hair. This doesn't necessarily mean they will leave your daughters head if she has dirty hair. Lice do not survive off a human head for very long at all so will only leave when a transferring opportunity (through physical contact) arises. <br>  <br>  Tea tree oil is an excellent Lice repellent. Here are 4 different head lice prevention methods with Tea Tree Oil:<br>  <br>  1. Mix 10 drops of Tea Tree oil in with her shampoo. This will make her totally invisible to the lice as they no longer regard her as human. As transferring to anything other than a human spells certain death, they are not even willing to take the chance. <br>  <br>  2. Put her hair up in a tight plait. Lice find it harder to get hold of hair that is well up and out of the way. Mist her hair with water in spray bottle and 10 drops of Tea Tree added. This will help to further repel them.<br>  <br>  3. It is possible to repel them by simulating dirty hair as this makes it hard for the lice to move around or attach their eggs. Gel is one way to simulate a dirty environment without the hair actually being dirty. Mix in a few drops of Tea Tree oil. This will be a double whammy as the lice will not think she is human as well as it being impossible for them to move around or attach their eggs.<br>  <br>  4..You can also get "leave in" conditioner which will do the same trick again. Add 10 drops of Tea Tree Oil and spray this over a tight plait every day.<br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following sites for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|n1vKoto7aa	Yikes! My first (totally unreasonable) thought would be to keep my kid home for a week or two until the outbreak was contained. I fear lice with a passion!!! Since your daughter has to go to school, I would just keep doing what you're doing. Check often so you can take care of it as soon as it happens and hopefully it won't spread too far.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	No they don't work but if u spray listeren the original one (yellow/brown) color once a week on clean wet hair and let it dry she will be just fine and put 1 teaspoon of tea tree oil in 32 oz of shampoo. Wash her hair every time with it. She will not get infested they don't like the smell or the taste of either. Good luck. Also shake the shampoo good before u use it. EVERYTIME|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	20-30 drops of tea tree oil in her shampoo/conditioner.....it will keep them out guaranteed. i use it on my daughter ALL the time, it works...the smell goes away when it dries, and its also good for your scalp.....it also doesnt leave your hair oily or greasy, only the bugs know its  in there<br>  <br>  you wouldnt thumbs down this if you ever tried it. it keeps the lice off my childs hair, people really shouldnt voice their opinion on things they know nothing about.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Probably not,but worth a try. Might sound like a silly idea,but I would only wash her hair every other day until this lice thing goes away. I've read that lice prefer a very clean head.. :)|`|uGxWOIOdaa	Saturate her hair with baby oil & then put it up in a bun.<br>  Theres no way the bugs will be able to attach to her hair. I would do this EVERYDAY until this matter is cleared up @ school.|`|K2QwEM4raa	Not much you can do but keep an eye on her hair and make sure she knows to not share combs,jackets,etc.|`|AA11537580	lice love clean hair.<br>  I always keep my daughters hair up and put hair spray in it before school.<br>  she hasn't had any lice yet even though there have been break outs of lice at the school<br>  remind her to not share hats and keep her head away from other kids,<br>  keep her hair short or up all the time and a little bit of hair spray in it.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Firstly the measures you went to were completely over the top. If you knew anything about lice then you'd know that they don't live outside the hair/scalp..they're not fleas, they don't live on furniture, brushes, pillows or anything else other than hair. You sound like a responsible parent but unfortunately there are the parents that allow head-lice to be a pretty much permanent thing in their children's lives and it only takes one kid to keep the spread going. Every school in every country deals with head-lice and my sons had them a few times since starting school but to me that's just the way it is and you have to get on with it, notify the teacher and treat them . The lady that says about the olive oil is correct, lice don't like anything greasy because they can't grip onto the hair strand, as you've probably noticed all of the treatment lotions are very greasy. Tea tree oil is apparently a repellent for them and as you have a daughter you could always have her wear a bandanna type hairband to school as a girl in my sons class does, her mother told me that preventing head-lice was the reason for this. You could try the sprays. I'm so surprised that they actually send kids home for this in your country,
zzkmdusEaa	It's basically just all out, frantic, kissing like there is no tommorow. It's not like the peck on the cheek you would give a grandparents, it's open mouth kissing again and again and again. You can't really explain it, he will most likely pick it up on his own.<br>  <br>  I would also talk to your son that making out can lead to other things. So I would say it is time for the birds and the bees talk as well.|`|4gqeQB1naa	I think its time you let him know were baby's come from. There are A lot of 13yr old that are having baby's and sex.<br>  I would tell him that kissing is as far as he needs to go and he better be careful doing that parents of 13 year old girls are doing everything they can to keep them from kissing or talking to boys. kids are having kids. <br>  Holding hands and talking is as far as he needs to go or he might get a big brother or a crazy Dad on him. Teach him to be careful life happens fast there is no hurry to start making out.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I personally feel that that's more of a subject that is much easier to try than to explain.  Not saying he should go suck face but no one knows how to make out at first.

Ej2EOsvKaa	HI! see this really sucks because if your being responsible and ask your parents if you can go on birth control then they will get mad or judge you. And lets say you get pregnant..then they will still get mad and judge you! So its like you never win! Believe me, be responsible. Wait till your really ready which is what your doing so kudos. <br>  If you think it might happen its not a bad idea to talk to parents about it. In the end they will be happy that you are not going to get pregnant. Sometimes us teens are just to scared to ask parents. It happened to me! Dont let the chiken in you keep from asking your parents! Good luck! <br>  :)|`|PfE6bg5iaa	It's very nice to hear that your boyfriend is respectful and that you respect *yourself* enough to say that you would kick him to the curb if he wasn't. You are lightyears ahead of many teenage girls, sadly.<br>  <br>  I'm not a mom, yet, but I'm a big sister to two little girls (ages 2 and 7) and I think I would be very upset if they or my future daughter did not feel comfortable discussing this with me before getting on the pill.<br>  <br>  However, I have a different spin on this whole thing. Last October I found out I have a genetic blood disorder. When coupled with birth control pills, I ended up in the hospital with blood clots in my lungs and nearly didn't survive. If my daughter (or sisters) snuck around, they may unknowingly put themselves at risk. <br>  <br>  So I think it goes both ways tho, if the mom doesn't open up the lines of communication about these things early then she can't expect the average insecure, teenage girl to go out of her way to talk about uncomfortable subjects. <br>  <br>  So I wouldn't say I'd be mad, just hurt that my daughter wouldn't feel that she could come to me and also a bit mad at myself for not doing enough to build that trust and openness.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your mom!!|`|FcHplZtQaa	no, I'd be glad  that she had thought resposibly|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Yeah,but not so much about the birth control,more upset that she was having sex so young. But I'd much rather find out about birth control than an unplanned pregnancy.|`|MVgm17o3aa	I would be hurt because i would still think of her as my little girl but i would be proud that she is being responsible and using protection|`|0vLU2GGGaa	if my daughter is 16, i wouldn't be mad, at least she is taking care of herself and being responsible.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	I'm not a parent, but I started birth control at 15 and my mom was fully aware of it from the start. I wasn't sexually active then, and it was prescribed to me to regulate my periods. Many girls and women take birth control for that reason. Obviously, it was the added benefit of birth control. <br>  <br>  I was already dating my boyfriend when I started birth control, and my mom just had a long talk with me about how the consequences of sex are much more than just getting pregnant. You can still get STDs while taking the pill. It does not protect you from them at all. There are also emotional consequences. If you a boy breaks up with you, and he is the one you lost your virginity to, it's going to hurt a whole lot more. Sex changes you, physically and emotionally, and it's not something to be taken lightly. <br>  <br>  If you feel comfortable talking to your mom about this, great. If not, then educate yourself about birth control and put a lot of thought into whether you are absolutely ready for sex. Protect your body and your emotions. <br>  <br>  Good luck. : )|`|45nSn7Rcaa	It is very sad that your parents haven't and don't talk to you about sex.  We talk to our daughters about sex and contraceptives.  We've talked to them about the responsabilities of sex and everything that goes along with it.   They know where they can get the pill for free from planned parenthood, they knw they can also come and talk to us about it and they know to use condoms as well and that we would be happy to provide them or they can get them for free at planned parenthood too.  We've talked about what would happen if they got pregnant too.  We hope they would come talk to us about any of this , but for some reason they don't we are confident they would be responsible and get and use the proper protection.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	I would not be mad although I would have expected her to tell me about it. I would have taken her. Your parents have not discussed sex with you so I can see you not telling them. There needs to be an open line of discussion here on the subject but they are the ones that are suppose to open it. Remember that if you ever have children. Communicate will them their whole life and make sure they are educated on the things they need to be. It goes a long way.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I would be upset that she was having sex and upset that she didn't consult me and talk to me about it because she is your age and we are like best friends. But, I don't want her to get pregnant.  That's a really hard question for a mom!|`|rpsXPdFmaa	It depends on why.  If it's for periods that's one thing and very understandable.  If it's for sex I'd be a bit upset truthfully.  Glad she'd be protecting herself but upset she wouldn't come to her father and me about it first.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well i hope my daughter would come and talk to me about it so that we can discuss things together. i would take her for the pills myself if she was thinking about having sex. i would rather her be safe then sorry.|`|bghotovYaa	I wouldn't be mad that she is taking the birth control.<br>   But I would be mad that she is having sex so young.|`|zhrGiQsKaa	no, at least she is smart enough to keep herself protected.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	Well as a parent, I think I would probably feel a little sad and disappointed that my daughter felt she couldn't talk to me about wanting to use birth control. I understand that at 16 kids are going to start experimenting and parents can't be there all the time. <br>  On the other hand, I think even though I'd be sad, I'd also feel proud of my daughter for having enough sense to understand the importance of birth control. I would be happy to know that my daughter is responsible enough to know to use contraception. This to me would be a sign that I have raised her well.<br>  <br>  Maybe you should talk to your mum. If your parents like your boyfriend and you have been together for a while, I think your parents would understand that their 16yr old is growing up. You sound like a very smart girl.<br>  Whatever you choose to do, just remember that the pill alone will not 100% protect you from pregnancy and will not protect you against STD's. You should always use condoms as well to be extra safe.|`|jwftwLBTaa	No i wouldn't- i would be mad if she did not take care of herself. If your Mom did not have the talk with you, start the conversation with her- she may be uncomfortable, but it is important to have a line of communication with her. If she isnt able to do it, try talking to a friends Mom, or even the school nurse.|`|8XcRFF6Taa	Yes and no.  Upset because she is having sex... but happy she is at least being smart about it.  Gosh I'm dreading the teen years:(  I do think you mom would be more upset if she found out you were pregnant:)  Get on birth control, just because nothing is going on now, doesn't mean it won't, better to be prepared!|`|Zdvx8uBcaa	Just sit your mom down and have the talk with her. She doesn't have to be the one to bring it up. I mean, at least you want to be careful and take precautions. She can't be made at you for that.|`|MloahqFVaa	I would be proud to know that he/she was being responsible. It all depends on the parent though.|`|tGEMwgyBaa	I have a 12 year old and I've already had the sex talk with her. I have also told her that she can come to me for anything, any time. That includes the things that she thinks I might get upset about. She has already tested this and I did not freak out on her. Now she is very open with me. <br>  I would be upset if I found out she was on birth-control without telling me first. I think any mother would be, this is a big deal and mothers want to know that their kids trust them to talk to them about these things. If anything you mother may now not trust you for going behind her back with this. If you hid this what else are you hiding. I  hope you haven't done it yet and if you have, the longer you wait the worst it will be. She will get over it but it will take time for you to earn her trust back. Good Luck
AA11296427	Ehh, why didn't you use a condom?! Of course you can get pregnant!<br>  If you miss your period, take a test.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  :]|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	havent you ever heard of plan b? or a condom? or birth control in general? <br>  <br>  theres no way to tell till you miss your period. too bad for you. and it doesnt matter if he got it all in you or a little. in one drop of semen there are about 1500 little sperms.|`|1thzSbS8aa	You can't tell before you take a pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  Technically, nobody is pregnant two days after sex. That's a medical impossibility. If there wasn't an egg ready at the time, fertilization may not have even occurred yet. Sperm can live for 3-5 days in the reproductive tract. Even if the timing was perfect and an egg was ready to go and got fertilized within hours, it would still take several days for that egg to travel through the fallopian tubes and implant in the uterus.<br>  <br>  There are NO symptoms or signs before implantation. There will be no pregnancy hormones before implantation either, which is why you have to wait at least two weeks before taking a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If you're that worried about pregnancy, you should have taken the morning-after pill. If it's been less than 72 hours, you still can.|`|Na1HDNncaa	i think that the sooner you take it the better..but the tell sing i guess it would be if you're late on your period.|`|524Dxtgeaa	take a test in like a week or two but go to  a doctor

Make sure your in a position your comfortable in.|`|kwMuRDFjaa	I had sex 8 weeks after I had my baby, and it still hurts until now!|`|oltCj6Kcaa	Get some lubricant.

Xnr5Y7Coaa	I think what you want to do is considered adoption right?<br>  <br>  Yes I think you can give legal rights to this person.<br>  I have a friend whose sister had a baby but wanted nothing to do with it so she signed a legal document to give up her rights and give custody to my friend. The father did the same.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure how it works when it's a non family thing but it's best to get some legal information perhaps?<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wrzUD1rMaa	Giving the baby to your friend would be the same thing as adopting the baby out to her.|`|VEkkn2Otaa	She would be considered legal guardian but you would have all the rights. thats not a good idea, just go through the right steps|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Same thing as adoption.

So when I was in labor I was able to pinpoint what my body was doing and where my baby was.  But you can learn that just about anywhere.  You can google information, get books, What To Expect When You're Expecting has some chapters on labor and delivery and it even has a chapter for expecting fathers during labor and delivery.  Go to your library and get some books.|`|XRbHcGuLaa	Hi!  Seems silly but my husband and I ordered a Lamaze DVD off of ebay and watched it together.  I was well aware of everything that happens during labor and delivery and after, since I had read several books on the topic and been through it all with my doctor.  So my husband was educated on the subjects through the DVD and we didn't go to a single class.  So try a few books like "What to Expect When You're Expecting" and look for the Lamaze DVD stages of childbirth and breathing exercises and you'll do just fine!|`|AA12380496	They are not really necessary.

Try to find a support group for teen moms in your town, because I can see that you're trying to find people to relate to with the same circumstances.

NOW.|`|TGzOrftPaa	I wouldn't wait around.  If you're afraid of getting in trouble by telling your parents, weight the risks.  Do you really want that on your chest if something happens to him tonight?  They could be able to point you in the right direction.  Otherwise look up some suicide hotline numbers and give them a call.  They will be able to better advise you in what to do and how he can get help.  I would also talk to your counselor about this tomorrow at school.  They will be able to help you figure out what to say to the person should this come up again.<br>  <br>  He needs to get help and you need to tell someone ASAP.|`|Ik5FVqcyaa	First of all, you HAVE to share this information with others, especially if he's in danger.

It's personal, but I don't think it's too personal so that you should talk about it first. It's not really even necessary to discuss it, just next you kiss him, hook up with him!<br>  <br>  If he's too shy to suggest it, then you'll have to make the first move! Honestly, it's fun, but don't stress over it :)<br>  <br>  Invite him to the movies! Haha it's a lot less awkward in the dark... trust me.<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|IAejVIFmaa	Invite him out to a movie, picnic or something & then juss go for it! Start it like a normal little kiss but don't pull back fast, and juss play around..like suck his bottom lip and twirl your tongue around his and stuff, its all good! Oh and also making out is not losing your purity!! lol<br>  lovelove!<br>  Jules
Y8ZmuWwgaa	It's pronounced noo-VELL. It's a French word meaning "new". If you want to use it as a name, I'd suggest spelling it Nouvelle, as French is a language that modifies adjectives based on gender. Nouvelle would be the feminine spelling. <br>  <br>  If you saw this on Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, please note that her middle name comes from the architect Jean Nouvel; Nouvel is not a given name used in France.|`|KeRqdX2Vaa	Resolved QuestionShow me another ? <br>  Proper pronunciation of this baby name?<br>  I like the name Nouvelle for a girl. It can also be spelt Nouvel. It is French and I would like to know the proper pronunciation.<br>  <br>  Best Answer - Chosen by Voters<br>  It's pronounced Nu-vell, but just so you know, in French, it is not a baby name, it's an adjective. French is my native language, and basically, it's as if I named my child New. Obviously, for people who don't speak French, it's just an uncommon name, but given that I already use the word, I'm really not a fan of using it on a baby, but hey, that's my opinion!|`|J9fxTGwKaa	emphasis on the vel<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452</a><br>  <br>  cute name!|`|LmlIzdwsaa	No-Vel emphasis on the vel|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	New-vel|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I pronounce it either NO-vle or NEW-vle.|`|AA11138222	New-VELL is how I would pronounce it. (the emphasis being on VELL lol)<br>  <br>  I think it's a pretty name, but I wish it had a nice nickname, cause I have a hard time being sold on a name that doesn't have a good nickname (It stems from the fact that my name cannot be shortened and I HATE that!)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	New-vel emphasis on vel.|`|SF1uPJZhaa	The proper French pronunciation is more like "noo-VELL", not "new". <br>  <br>  If you are talking about Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, she was named for French architect Jean Nouvel. It's actually a last name, not a first name (it's not even used as a first name in France).|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I have never even heard of this name, that is really interesting, I can't comment on how it is pronounced, but where did you find it? And what are you thinking of pairing it with?|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	New-Vel|`|dKMpztcJaa	Means new in french, pronounced New-v-el
aLAmvX5Naa	Formula isn't poison, if you had to run out for an emergency and didn't have time to pump your child would be okay to have formula.<br>  <br>  Between the ages of 0-6 months my daughter drank about 5 oz of formula. She was fine. She didn't really like it, but it didn't hurt her. I didn't feel like a failure.<br>  <br>  She went on a nursing strike at 11 months for DAYS and it took its toll and I gave up at that point. I did feel like a failure then.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is your kid has to eat. Don't feel bad if your baby has a little formula, its not going to hurt him.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I did give my daughter formula a few times when she was younger. I dont really know why, I had no good reason other than I was uneducated about how breastfeeding worked and had everyone and their mother telling me she 'needed' formula. I dont feel bad or guilty that she had it. I just wouldnt give it to any future children. I know more about breastfeeding now than I did when she was a newborn.<br>  <br>  there is nothing wrong with formula though, its great to have when a mother cant or wont breastfeed|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	I had a challenging experience breastfeeding also.  My baby was a preemie, and we were told to supplement with formula to help her weight increase.  The lactation consultant at the hospital told me that if I nursed her more often, I could avoid using formula.  The nurses in the hospital refused to listen to me or the lactation consultant, and kept feeding her formula, so when I'd ask for her to breastfeed, she wasn't hungry.  When I got to take her home, she didn't want to nurse, so I had to use a nipple shield.  We used one for 2 months, and then finally, it got easier!  Now, at 10 months, we are weaning.  I had to go back to work full time when my baby was 3 months, and I couldn't pump enough.  I had a freezer stash built up of frozen pumped milk from the first 3 months, and I continually added to it, but when she was 9 months old, I ran out of pumped milk, so I had to start giving her formula for the two feedings she gets at daycare.  I feel like I've given her all the help she needed with her immune system and health for the first 9 months, and I'm still breastfeeding morning and night, but don't feel like a failure if you have to use formula once in a while.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	I had to supplement my 2nd for 2 weeks when he was brand new.   I did not feel like a failure, I knew he was extra large and had more needs then I could supply - it would be the same unless I was the not so ordinary mother with excess milk, instead I am average and had enough for a regular sized baby.   If I could I also wish my milk would come in sooner then it does for me, for me it takes days for it to come in, and I never get engorged early.<br>  <br>  The thing is I worked hard to reduce his dependence, I pumped between feedings, I switched twice between feedings, I took a lot of fenugreek - and that was while I also had a 18 month old to take care of.   It is easier to me to do that work then face the consequences later on of my poor health and/or his poor health because I failed to do the ground work for his healthy life, I'm selfish - I prefer a great pay off with a little work early then the extra work of formula feeding which brings the additional health deficits.<br>  <br>  It gets easier, a lot easier - you become an expert on nursing your child and your infant learns how to nurse effectively.   You will spend less time nursing each time, and your body will optimize to your son's needs.   You have a steep learning curve, and you're using your brain - you'd have the same learning curve with formula and no pay off in the long run.|`|UghJ0XROaa	Thank you for wording this in a more appropriate manner, i had to supplement with my oldest daughter when she was around 5-6 months, only because i was working, she was sleeping 12 hours a night, so i didn't get much time to nurse and could not pump enough. By the time she hit 9 months, she didn't have the patience to work hard to get the milk from my breast, when the bottle daddy gave her had instant satisfaction, it was heartbreaking. It upset me more that she stopped, than it hurt her. <br>  <br>  My little one is now 4 months old and has not touched formula yet and so far(fingers crossed) it continues to go well. I know formula won't hurt her, it's just not the option i chose. To anyone undecided on what they want to do to feed their baby, i would advocate breastfeeding.|`|68c6B8dRaa	"It is my goal for him to never have formula and so far it hasn't been easy."<br>  <br>  Ah, but it will be eventually, and it will, in the long run, be far easier for you than it is for mothers who did mess with bottles and formula. Stay the course.<br>  <br>  I would not have given formula for whatever reason. Had my breasts fallen off I would've gone looking for people who could donate milk.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I also hope to never have to give my DD formula, but I recognize that circumstances could arise beyond my control. I could get very sick or need mediation that lasts longer than my frozen milk supply. I wouldn't feel like a failure, because I would know I did my best to BF, and that I already gave my baby a head start that a lot of babies never get.  If I had been having a challenging time to start with, I would be proud that I stuck with it as long as I was able to, despite the difficulties.  You should be proud of yourself for doing so.  You will not be a "failure" if you later choose or need to supplement with formula. I applaud your goal, but I think you are being much too hard on yourself.|`|4KXA5oVtaa	Don't feel like a failure, breast feeding brings you from a full time Mom to a working over time Mom.  I had a c-section with my first son and my milk did not come in for 5 days.  He was extremely unhappy in the hospital and the first few days at home as I was literally starving him.  As soon as my milk came in he was fine however, I felt horrible that I couldn't supply what he demanded.  I successfully breast fed him until 12 months.  I had my second son 3 weeks ago, also by c-section.  This time I asked that in the hospital I breast feed him and also supplement him with formula when he asked for more that I was able to supply.  Needless to say, the stress level was A LOT lower, which made me calmer, my baby calmer (fuller and happier :)) and my milk came in on day 3!  The baby also lost less weight than my first son.  Through all of this I would say keep up on breast feeding and pumping.  If you need to increase your supply I would suggest feeding your baby until they're satisfied and then immediately pumping afterward any that is left.  (It kind of tells your body your baby requires a little more.)  Obviously breast is best, but remember, formula would not be available if it was unsafe for your baby.  We are only human.  Like I said, breast feeding is a job in itself.  Take care of your baby but also take care of yourself.  Good luck!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I had to supplement with formula the first week because the nurses had given her formula at the hospital without mypermission when they gave her a bath. So her stomach stretched from it and the itty bitty bit of cholostrum was not enough. I felt horrible!!! I felt like a complete failure and was very angry at myself and the nurses. But once my milk came in I had more than enough. Now I keep a ton extra. I have 382 ounces in the freezer right now. So if she goes through growth spurts and things like that I don't feel guilty, I just supp with my extra milk<br>  <br>  Don't feel bad about the nipple sheild. I have to use one too. She was born tounge tied, and ever since she was born I've had to use it. Well, when she will actually nurse. I mostly pump during the day and nurse at night.|`|83nHy2PXaa	I felt exactly like you for the first 2 months and it was very tough for us, mostly me I think. I had several consultations and finally we got fine. I can totally understand your feelings, but try not to give up, just be strong and continue as long as you can. Every day is for his benefit. <br>  I had this goal and we are 12 months breastfeeding, now I can tell that it became a real pleasure for us.|`|l6nAcep5aa	I would feel pretty bad to have to give my baby formula as i know it could reduce my milk supply i have a 4 week old and breast feeding is so hard as he is lazy i have to permenantly use a nipple sheild but i think thats better than formula any day!|`|Hpp26zQjaa	It's okay to give him formula. You are NOT a failure and there is nothing wrong with it. You do what is right for you and your baby if it's giving him formula great if not that's fine too.

The best choice would be sweet potatoes, potatoes, carrots, green beens, zukini. You can also give him some uncooked avocado, banana, mango, tofu.|`|dW4DbkCLaa	I know exactly how you feel. I don't eat so great myself, my husband does all the cooking, and I can't cook at all. It's just one of those things I suck at.

You could try cooking some carrots then cutting them up and feeding them to him. That goes for any type of vegetable or fruit, as long as they are in bite-size pieces. Also, the grocery store has great baby food from Gerbers. Applesauce is also delicious. Lastly, babies AH-DORE Cheerios. Hope that helps! :)|`|7Qt9F0elaa	The chicken is defiantly a good start. Try buying some fresh peaches and peeling them then cut into bite size pieces. He won't need a full fledged meal, just a bunch of little things that he enjoys. boiled carrots are good. what ever baby food he likes, he will like it in normal form|`|iqsPmmD4aa	go with good old fashioned cheerios. kids LOVE them!|`|p2Njf5gBaa	If you can put some water in a pot them you can steam veggies.  Carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, potatos, or green beans are all great starter finger foods.  Just put some water in a pot, rinse the veggies, place them in to steam until tender, take out, cool and serve.  <br>  <br>  Cheese is also a great finger food, check cheese packaging first though, as some cheese can have high sodium contents.  <br>  <br>  Bananas are a great finger food that require no preparation, as well as avacado, peaches, plums and pears, (I would peel the fruit at first though)|`|68c6B8dRaa	Get a vegetable steamer; there's very little in the produce section that can't be nicked into sticks, steamed, and given to a baby.

I like Kymani for a boy. It gets confusing when father and son have the same name. You could use Kaniela for one of his middle names. No offense at all to your husband, but being from the upper 48 states, I'm used to hearing only girls names end in "a", so my first thought was that Kaniela would be a girls name, like Daniella. (But you should do whatever fits for your family.) For a girl, I like Aaliya. It is less common than Adrianna or Arianna, and very pretty.

VS8mactUaa	There is no such section tho I wish there were.  Personally Im ok with it as long as the question relates directly to the one who asked it, not just what do you think of abortion. All they try to do is get a stir out of people, and trollers that like to piss off the Y!A community. If someone has a genuine question about abortion I am more then happy to answer it.|`|UrZ8SFpqaa	Actually, to be honest with you...I am getting sick of all of the "my boyfriend kissed me and I'm fourteen, am I pregnant?" <br>  <br>  Yeah, those questions are annoying!|`|pzLDXL6gaa	No. This is the Pregnancy section. You have to be pregnant to have an abortion. This is not the "Planned Pregnancies" section or "Pregnant and Happy and Keeping the Baby" section. It covers everything to do with pregnancy. Lots of questions here are about birth control, not pregnancy anyway.<br>  <br>  What does annoy me is when people say "what is your opinion" or "I have to write a paper tell me all about it". Those questions are useless and irritating. But somebody asking a technical question or where to go? No that belongs in this section.<br>  <br>  It is sad if some people are having fertility difficulties, and others get pregnant easily and are miserable about it. But everybody is different. One person's infertility is not the fault or the problem of somebody else! I think getting pregnant when you don't want to can be just as devastating as not being able to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|gieEWY1Qaa	I am. There needs to be a section for abortion I am SOOO sick of it. And I don't want to hear it. For us who want our baby's and are having miscarriages or other complications, and they just want to throw there babys away. It really makes me mad.|`|AA11764194	Me.. Me..<br>  <br>  I just hate them..|`|Do6NfeACaa	I am yes, but you just asked one so I guess you aren't.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Well, I agree that this section is for pregnancy.  However, there is NOT another section (other than ethics) that would be relevent.  And most people in there are not experienced in the area of pregnancy/abortion/etc.  So while they can be annoying, and "pot-stirring", there really isnt anywhere else for them to go.|`|AA11294818	It would be really nice to have other columns for things like abortion and also one for purely sexuality questions.<br>  On the other hand... it might be good to have abortion questions stay in the pregnancy section so the women who are considering abortion can see what other women are going through in pregnancies and may change their minds...? You never know!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Questions about abortions don't really bother me until they start saying that they want to perform an abortion on themselves.  It's really a messed up thing to say around pregnant women.  I just don't even want to look at a title that say "How can I do a self-abortion?"  ugh it's gross.|`|zBz10IiOaa	i agree with you 200%  but why waste your points hun there not worth it just let them be except for the mothers who had a medically reason.|`|Svo5Kqbyaa	yes! and all the questions about unprotected sex and pregnancy. its like, if you have sex, you can get pregnant!|`|XzbRZCPUaa	i think maybe they could be looking for assurance that everything will be ok and they don't need to go through with it hopefully we can chance there minds !|`|gY3wh4psaa	YES!<br>  aboration has nothing to do with being happily pregnant|`|GsSRY7quaa	YES. it's legal, and a personal choice that no one else should stick their nose into for any reason.|`|zoAqdu1Jaa	Wow, lots of high and mighties around here. Life is so simple for most people. The answers are laid out in stone. It's either black or white. No one has problems or concerns.(rollseyes)  Abortion is not an easy solution to a problem, but a devastating decision, wether some of you believe that or not.<br>  <br>   No, I am not sick of these questions. It is important for people to have a place to turn and look for advice. It does not irritate me, or  desensitize me. If anything makes me angry it's the judgmental, totally perfect, never done anything wrong in their life attitudes. Especially the religious people. Ummm hello??!?!! Judging is no different than any other sin!! Some of you making these women feel unwanted and uncomfortable is what makes me sick. It's about having compassion for ANYBODY in a situation like that....ugh
4iXL4C6paa	I have 2 girls and 2 boys, with my girls I didn't gain as much weight as I did with my boys (and they were all in the same weight range when they were born), I also carried my girls higher than I did my boys|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I have two girls and only one boy right now.

6qCnpxrNaa	There's nothing wrong with not getting a crib.  I have a small apartment too and if my brother hadn't been saving his kids crib for me a pack and play is what my husband and I would have purchased.  Don't let yourself get to thinking you have to have "this" or "that".  All you need is a healthy, happy baby and some imagination as to how best to order their living space.  You'll do great!|`|deIzFnV8aa	There is nothing wrong with using the playpen, though it probably isn't quite as comfy. The main thing I would think about if I were you is how hard it might be on your back.  You get baby in and out of a crib _a lot_, esp at first. It is much easier when the mattress is at arm height already with low railings. I _dread_ the time when DD can sit up and I have to move the mattress down a notch.  With a pak and play it woudl be a lot of bending and lifting right from the start.<br>  <br>  I wonder if they make any slightly bigger bassinett type thiings? those would take up less room but be at a better height. You would just want to make sure that baby wouldn't outgrow it in a few months!|`|z6IekuwSaa	I'm using mine as a crib right now. I'm getting a crib though next month. I don't think there is anything wrong. I felt safer using it because it just had enough padding. Not as much s a crib. I was just so afraid of SIDS that I didn't want very much cushionor fluff|`|16vwEBiqaa	Thats is perfectly fine. I recommend getting the ones that have the optional snap in bassinet have a Graco one. That way sleeping baby doesn't wake up when you try to but he/she down.|`|CN44WsTpaa	I have to use a pack and play because of the limited amount of space I have to work with.  My daughter is two months old and doesn't even sleep in it (she prefers her baby papasan) but it is helpful in the sense that it comes with a built in changing table. And I know that the bassinet is there for when the day comes that she decides to sleep in it. I guess the only disadvantage is that it can only hold up to 25 pounds. So eventually I will have to get her a crib.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	A pack and play can be used for sleeping, that's the only thing I have ever used the pack and play for.  Although this is only when we are visiting people or traveling.  I have crib for at home.  a pack and play can be used, but they really aren't as comfortable and are much more hard then a crib mattress.  Perhaps you could have a pack and play and then also co sleep some as well.|`|Gqs6H0Z0aa	A lot of people use them as beds instead of using a crib. My kids used theirs for naps and occasionally slept in them over night, especially when they were newborns and still in our room. They are fine as a bed, I guess, but I just thought they seemed too uncomfortable to use in place of a crib.
WWcaKZ7Qaa	I've found Bio Oil to be the best, it hasn't made mine disappear of course but it fades them from red/purple to a very light skin color very quickly. After pregnancy though, Retin A works really well. I've used it on stretch marks on my breasts and they are pretty much gone, no color to them and they are very smooth. But, you definitely can't use that while you are pregnant.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i've used Palmer's cocoa butter every since i got pregnant. and i have no stretch marks what so ever.|`|WPI0Z47saa	They will fade on their own. it takes a little time but they will get skin colored like any other scar.|`|98WKYtfwaa	I have to say that Bio oil is the main thing that's worked for me, it reduced the purple/redness of mines and now they're hardly noticable.<br>  <br>  I've tried everything from cheap to expensive.<br>  <br>  EDIT* Don't know why i've been thumbsed down. Palmers cocoa butter and olive oil doesn't work because it contains mineral oil, anything with mineral oil doesn't prevent or help stretchmarks at all.|`|dCLnLlsCaa	I swear by olive oil!  During my first pregnancy I got stretch marks and I tried all that palmer's pregnancy oil, butter cream, etc...none of it worked.  Now I'm almost 7 months with no new stretch marks thanks to olive oil!  I rub it all over my tummy like every other day and it's not even that itchy either, trust me, the stuff works!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	try to gain weight at a steady pace that way your body wont stretch soo fast so quick. use vitamin e oil to moisturize skin and also stay hydrated|`|AA11542929	palmers cocoa butter|`|ftvxAS3saa	IM TRYING PALMERS COCO BUTTER STRECH MARK CREAM AND  I JUST GOT SKIN ESSENTIALS WALGREENS MAKES IT, I LIKE IT I FEEL THE LOTION ALL DAY ON ME AN I THINK THATS GOOD!!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	darling try using Palmers Cocoa Butter - this is what i used and it was good and im still using it after birth.<br>  <br>  it can be used any where that strech marks are or can appear.<br>  <br>  but i do know that alot of ladies prefer Bio Oil which is known to be good.<br>  <br>  God Bless x
t4HXotwEaa	i started drinking this religiously at 38 weeks.  My daughter was born at 43 weeks.  It tasted nice though.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I drank the tea my entire pregnancy on my midwife's orders. It tones your uterus to make contractions more effective but does nothing to start labor. I also took EPO(evening primrose oil) starting at 35wks, it works to soften your cervix. My water broke at 38wks, my cervix was soft and ready but didn't dilate past 1cm on it's own so I was induced after 14hrs.|`|3EhoJ42zaa	Actually obgyns/midwives suggest starting Red Raspberry leaf tea  atleast a month or two before delivery.

zkWdjyKvaa	I started taking Fertilaid a month ago. At the last week of taking it I started my period. Now I am hoping to ovulate. I haven't had a period in 2 years so this is amazing already... Good luck and lots of baby dust to you!!! Cross your fingers I ovulate in a few days...

So you can't get symptoms this early. The earliest I've heard people say is 2 weeks po<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|7xit1ogxaa	After ovulation, if you conceived, it takes 7-10 days for implantation to occur and then another 3-4 days before your body is producing enough HCG to produce a positive result and for you to experience symptoms. That means that pregnancy symptoms will generally start 10-14 days after ovulation. However, other than a missed period, many women don't experience any symptoms until around 6 weeks.
1uAduUKhaa	From the time that I was 12 until I was 18, I babysat many boys and changed lots and lots of diapers. <br>  <br>  In my opinion Goodnites are diapers. I suppose you can differentiate in that pull ups allow the child to have a 'big boy' experience, instead of having his mother or the woman caring for him diaper him. Pull ups are worn by children that haven't matured but lets face it, diapers or pullups are something that a woman requires her son to wear until he has matured. <br>  <br>  Boys mature later than girls and it isn't unusual for a boy to require a bed time diaper until he is 10-13 years old. Obviously an 11 year old wishes he didn't need to wear diapers. But when he must wear a diaper, pull ups provide the boy wetness protection he needs and gives him a more 'grown-up or big boy' solution than having to be diapered by the woman caring for him.<br>  <br>  One final thing: A boy who wets himself and wears 'pull ups' or is diapered runs the risk of skin irritation and diaper rash. This is particularly true in the cold winter months when the boy is bundled up and wet diaper changes are less frequent. <br>  <br>  If the boy is being allowed to wear pull ups, It is important that he is bathed regularly and that his mother or caregiver make sure that the boys diaper area is clean fresh and healthy. I recommend appling baby oil to the boys diaper area each nite regardless of whether or not he wears pull ups or is diapered. <br>  <br>  And if a rash develops, the best way to stop it is to squirt a large dollop of Desitin into your palm, mix it with a few drops of baby oil and then smooth the mixture over the effected area. It will sooth boys sensitive skin, make him more comfortable and it should clear up in a jiffy :)|`|8RfmosODaa	Yea for night time|`|BRT2teSqaa	No.  Are Depends "training pants" then, too?|`|f5aa23cdbd4ef64eaad598ab21fef48caa	I think Mrs. Janice and Tia are correct.   Goodnites are merely disposable diapers that the child can 'pull-up' by himself.   It is less babyish in that mother or babysitter don't have to put the diaper him so he can be a  'Big Boy.   But the truth is the reason for them is because the boy hasn't outgrown wetting and it is necessary for him to wear something that is geared toward babies and toddlers.  Call them diapers, pull ups or whatever, the purpose for wearing them is the same.|`|49f06b796d54e170c36a6cf4fc463182aa	Personally I think the answer to this question would depend who you ask.  I think they are not considered training pants, but are considered incontinence breifs.  It does not sound so babyish that way.|`|zrhrJQvtaa	No I wouldn't consider them training pants. My boys wear them and I would never refer to them as training pants. The kids are already potty train, it's just that their bladders haven't matured.|`|2rGbz9vqaa	I am in the 8th grade and still wet the bed.  My mom says we can't afford pull ups so she puts me in cloth diapers with pins with waterproof diaper pants so that I don't soak the bedsheets.   When I stay with my Aunt, she buys Goodnites pull ups for me.   I like them better but I know that they are really diapers no matter what they say on the package.
A0tWlG94aa	just make sure you're both relaxed and not thinking too much about getting pregnant..i know its hard not to think about it but it can put pressure on you which is not good for you... make sure you both c** and lie down on your back with your knees bent and put a cushion  under your abdomen and stay like that for 5-10 mins..dont rush to the bathroom straight away...<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  x

ufnSqRiqaa	I think I like Maximillian and Saffron best.  I am a big fan of longer names with shorter version nick names.  If you're going with a longer name, people (close friends and family at least) will shorten it.  Even if you prefer and ask that people not shorten it, when the child is older his/her friends will do so.  So that is something to take into consideration.  Do you like Max?  If not, you should go with Isaac or Ernie.  I think Jo, Jo jo or Joey for Jocasta is cute, but if you don't, do not name her that.  With my daughter I narrowed it down and waited until I saw her before I chose.|`|AA11138222	I like Isaac for a boy.<br>  <br>  For girls I like Olivia, Ophelia, and Saffron, though I'm not too keen on the Saffy name.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Isaac and Ophelia. :-)|`|dK6YGyNyaa	Isaac - nice, simple name - 9/10<br>  Ernie - a bit old fashioned but nice - 7/10<br>  Maximillian - I prefer Maxwell or just Max - 4/10<br>  <br>  Juno - too weird for me, reminds me of the film - 2/10<br>  Jocasta - really dislike this one - 0/10<br>  Saffron/Saffy - really cute, love Saffy - 9/10<br>  Olivia - pretty name, lots of nicknames to go with it - 8/10<br>  Ophilia - don't really like it but prefer Ophelia - 3/10|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Maximillian but even that one I don't care for but it's still better than Ernie or Isaac<br>  <br>  Olivia for the girl.|`|2716717868fe21f32f85869cd02f81d8aa	I really like the names Isaac and Olivia|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Isaac and Olivia!|`|fYed2Crjaa	I Love Isaac, hate the other two for boys.<br>  <br>  For the girls, i don't really care for any of them, Olivia is cute though.<br>  How about Alaska instead of Juno haha. <br>  Alaska is my favorite girls name.|`|OXxKTM6vaa	I love the name Isaac.

It is also a journey, one that is sometimes riddled with complications and problems. Many couples including those faced with infertility find that trying to conceive is often a battle that is fiercely overcome after months of strenuous effort and challenges.<br>  <br>  Fortunately many couples that are trying to conceive will realize success at some point or another. For couples that are faced with infertility, there are multiple approaches to overcoming infertility challenges. These include natural or traditional therapies and more invasive or assisted reproductive technologies.<br>  Natural Approaches to Conceiving<br>  <br>  There are many natural approaches to conceiving. These include fertility charting or tracking. One of the simplest methods for determining your odds of conceiving includes tracking your ovulation. Tracking ovulation helps you determine the best times to have intercourse to improve your odds of conception.<br>  <br>  Tracking ovulation involves testing your basal body temperature. This is your temperature taken first thing in the morning, before you get out of bed. Generally you will have to sleep for at least three hours to get an accurate reading. Most women's temperature raises up to 1.6 degrees just after ovulation. If you track your cycles for several months you will start to notice patterns and are better able to predict the times you are most likely to be fertile.<br>  <br>  There are many other signs of increasing fertility. These include cervical mucous changes. Women who are approaching ovulation will often produce more abundant cervical mucous. The quality and texture of cervical mucous also changes. Fertile mucous is often clear, stretchy and resembles egg whites. Many women find they are able to stretch their cervical mucous between their fingers around the times they are most fertile.<br>  <br>  Cervical position may also indicate when a woman is most likely to conceive. During non fertile times of a woman's cycle, the cervix is usually resting low in the vagina. During or around the time of ovulation however the cervix rises and softens to prepare for conception and ovulation. Most women find however it takes a bit of practice to identify cervical position changes during their cycles. Like charting, you may find it takes a few tries before you accurately identify your cervical position at any given time during your cycle.<br>  Assisted Reproduction<br>  <br>  If you are younger than 35 and have been trying to conceive unsuccessfully for more than a year, or 35 and older and have been trying for six months or more, you might consider seeking the advice of a fertility specialist. There may be other factors contributing to your infertility or inability to conceive.<br>  <br>  Most doctors will recommend a full health physical and examination to rule out various physical and genetic causes of infertility. STD's and even stress may impact your ability to conceive, so your doctor will be able to cover your lifestyle and habits to identify any factors that may be contributing to your infertility.<br>  <br>  There are many treatments available for women who are infertile and couples experiencing infertility due to male factors. Less invasive measures for improving fertility include use of prescription medications like Clomid. Clomid helps regulate ovulation and can extend a luteal phase that is too short. It may also stimulate ovaries to produce more than one egg, which may lead to a multiple pregnancy.<br>  <br>  More invasive and often expensive treatments include IVF or intrauterine insemination. These options are often relied on as a last resort for couples experiencing infertility. If you are having trouble conceiving it is important you consult with your doctor so together you can decide the best course of action.|`|A0tWlG94aa	eat healthily..its a good thing you're already taken vitamins... track your ovulation days and when you are most fertile.. good luck<br>  <br>  x

ZxQak4GAaa	Hi - sounds like she is going through seperation anxiety.  The best thing you can do is continue to give her lots of love and support through this phase, NOT let her cry it out!  Children are very perceptive and look to their main caregiver for 'cues' on how to respond to a situation, so if you are happy and relaxed, it is most likely she will (eventually) become happy and relaxed.  If you don't like certain people or are having issues with them in your life, then your daughter is going to pick up on these vibes (even if you think you are not showing these signs).<br>  <br>  All children are different, she may just take longer than the next child when adjusting to changes and new people in her life.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is probably also at the age where she is starting to develop her imagination, so perhaps this is working overtime, thus may contribute to her clingyness?<br>  <br>  While she is going through this phase, I would hold off on daycare (unless absolutely necessary).  How about going to some mums groups, playgroups etc together until she becomes more confident?  Also, maybe try inviting just one child over to your house (familiar environmet) on a regular basis so she can get some social practice in?<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, my 20 month old daughter has just recently began to be very attached to me and is similar towards her father as well.  She was very outgoing etc. before this.  It can be very frustrating sometimes, but I keep telling myself "This too will pass!"|`|FLpMShKNaa	I think daycare would be really rough at this age-my son has gone since 6 weeks but I have heard that 1-2 is the high point for stranger and seperation anxiety, and a rough time to start. Maybe a playgroup or somewhere that she could be around other children, but still have you close by. Or try a mothers day out or daycare after she turns 2. I don't know about the race thing, maybe its just random-my son likes most people of any race (he is mixed race) but cries whenever he sees my neighbor, even though she's really sweet.<br>  If its any consolation, 1) I think its pretty normal and even healthy, though frustrating and 2) my older sis was like this at that age, and now she is a very assertive adult.|`|5DP859Gxaa	Well,I hate to break it to you like this. Your best bet in prying her of your hip is to let her cry it out. (not in the car of course) unless u have a really loud stereo.<br>   I suggest takeing her to a park on the weekends to get to know other ppl. That might help

jBnQiZVFaa	I get what you mean.  It is unlikely that they are spoiled so much as are in a stage where they want you to be as close to them as possible.  I know what is recommended is to start playing with them, sitting on the floor and getting them involved in their toys, and then get up and go into a room where they can still see you.  Even if they cry for a minute, talk to them from the other room and tell them you will be right back.  This helps them become more independent.  If they are mobile they might follow you, but keep repeating you are coming right back.  Only stay gone a short while at first and then up the time as they get more comfortable.  Then go out of sight for a second (if they are safely contained) and come back.  This teaches them that they can play on their own and that you are not leaving them.  I don't think it is mean to teach your children to play on their own.  Mine learned and it was not all easy and a bed of roses.  Kids need to learn that they have the capacity to learn things for themselves.|`|t5tU3Xe8aa	My twins do the SAME thing!!!!  LOL it's seperation anxiety I can't even go to the bathroom without them FREAKING out!!!!|`|8yTP3jO8aa	What the ...?<br>  <br>  So, they want to play.  Why can't you sit down on the floor with them and play cooperatively with them?  Heck, I'm sure they both could even sit on your lap or between your legs if they wanted that close to you.  Why is it that the only things they can need are food, clean diapers, and a comfortable temperature?  Wanting and needing to spend time with you, even some alone time with you, is not an indication of spoiled.  It is an indication of a *need*.<br>  <br>  Cry-it-out is a sleep training method, not a punishment or a "mommy's too busy to care about playing with you" technique.  If you were to just let them "cry it out" because they want to play with you, that would be neglect (not that CIO sleep training isn't, but that's another story).<br>  <br>  What kinds of things can the three of you do together?  Maybe read stories?  Play with blocks?  Put both of them in a big box and push them around the room?  Play tickle monster with both of them?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Why can't you hold them both at once?  I can carry around my three year old and one year old at the same time.  Or sit down and snuggle them.<br>  <br>  The NEED for human contact and attention is just as real as any other.  Human contact and attention are needed for brain development, as well as social skills, language learning, etc, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/touchhgr.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bflrc.com/ljs/breastfeeding/t...</a><br>  ouch Hunger<br>  <br>  Linda J. Smith, BSE, FACCE, IBCLC<br>  <br>  Some babies have very high "touch hunger." Ashley Montagu describes the first 9-12 months postbirth as the time of "external gestation." I've experienced a child with a very high need for touch - who literally cannot or do not sleep unless they are touching another human body. You can either (1) cope with it, (2) rejoice in your ability to meet this child's unique needs, or (3) resent the situation and fight it. #3 is the worst choice for the baby, of course. In most of the world, continuous contact is the norm. Expecting otherwise is actually quite unrealistic, but a problem nevertheless where velcro babies are not the "cultural norm."<br>  <br>  When I was a young mother, a wise La Leche League Leader in my area suggested I make the best of my high-touch-need baby and master the fine art of baby-wearing. (Thanks, Peggy Loyd.) Years later, I'm convinced that this type of child is probably very allergic and/or very intelligent. Mine was both. She attended a "magnet" school for gifted children in late elementary school. I met dozens of parents of very bright kids who described similar patterns in their babies. Does the smart child insist on all the skin contact they need to thrive? Or does the high-need child demand a lot of contact, which pushes their intelligence to extra-high levels?<br>  <br>  I think I see this more often in girls than boys. I also see an exceptionally high need for oral and physical experiences in these children - years of breastfeeding, nursing all night, chewing on buttons and clothing, etc.<br>  <br>  Touch your baby a LOT. It matters a lot.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T100200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T10020...</a><br>  Yet, telling the difference between needs and wants is not a problem that parents have to wrestle with during their early months of parenting. In the beginning, wants and needs are the same. During the first several months of life, a baby's wants are a baby's needs. A consistent "yes" response teaches babies trust, which will make them more accepting of "no" later on, when they start wanting things they should not have. If you learn to know your baby by responding readily to his needs in the early months, you'll have a good sense of when it's appropriate to say no later on.<br>  <br>  New parents often ask, "Won't holding our baby a lot, responding to cries, nursing our baby on cue, and even sleeping with our baby spoil her?" Or they ask if this kind of parenting will create an overly dependent, manipulative child? Our answer is an emphatic no. In fact, both experience and research have shown the opposite. Attachment fosters eventual interdependence. A child whose needs are met predictably and dependably does not have to whine and cry and worry about getting his parents to do what he needs.<br>  <br>  Dr. Sears suggests: Attachment parenting implies responding appropriately to your baby; spoiling suggests responding inappropriately.<br>  <br>  The spoiling theory seems scientific. At least it seemed logical to the childcare "experts" who popularized this idea, beginning in the early part of the 20th century. They thought that if you rewarded crying by picking the baby up, he would cry more, so that he would get picked up more. It turns out that human behavior is a little more complicated than this. It is true that if you carry a newborn baby in your arms much of the time, the baby will protest when put down in the crib. This baby has learned how to feel right, and she lets you know when she needs help getting that feeling back. However, in the long run, this rightness within her will make her less likely to cry for attention. She gets used to feeling right most of the time, and her parent's responsiveness shows her how to recognize her own needs. Spoiling happens when a child is put on the shelf, left alone, forgotten about--the way that food spoils. There was no scientific basis for this spoiling theory, just unwarranted fears and opinions. We would like to put the spoiling theory on the shelf – to spoil forever.<br>  <br>  The attachment style of parenting is not the same as overindulging kids or creating inappropriate dependency. The possessive parent, or "hover mother," is constantly in a flurry around her child, doing everything for him because of her own fears and insecurity. Her child may become overly dependent, because he has been kept from doing what he needs to do. An attached mother recognizes when it is appropriate to let her child struggle a bit, experience some frustration, so that he can grow. This is why we continually emphasize putting balance in your chosen parenting style. Attachment differs f|`|CN44WsTpaa	Hold them as much as you can and participate with them during their play time.  Provide as much stimulation and entertainment as you can.  After that if they still want more from you and they start crying, then I think its just time to let them cry a little bit.  As long as you know that nothing is wrong with them then it is fine for them to cry.  Afterwards, hopefully they'll either find a way to entertain themselves or they might just tire themselves out.  Eventually they'll learn that the world does not end just because they aren't in somebody's arms.

b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	There are so many people who do this.  If this was the case almost all children would be born with some kind of problem.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	They say that as long no more continues- Babies do continue on and are born fine.<br>  But there is always a chance of mis.c in every pregnancy darling.<br>  But keep strong darling & positive it is whats best. its mothers instict that you are feeling. But staystrong & dont put stress and worry on you and baby.<br>  its normal to worry of course.but baby will be okay<br>  <br>  God Bless|`|hoX7hoINaa	I drank in the beginning too. Found out at 5 weeks. It doesn't affect him/her because at this point they are not directly connected to your body, and are not receiving nutrients from you for quite a while yet, so don't worry. Now that you know you're pregnant, avoid it.|`|AA11542929	stop it now and u should be good.. take vitamins, take care urself, if u want to u can mention it to ur doctor but i wouldnt unless u feel comfortable with that . dont think negative.. always think positive.. i know someone who smoked weed everyday as much as she can and drank as much as she can to miscarry and she never did she had a healthy baby girl and the doctor told her she was going to have to many veins in her body and all this other crap and she didnt.. she came out healthier then ever.. take care of urself.|`|cP0NnP6Oaa	my friend did that same thing. she didnt know she was pregnant. and partied every weekend for a month. and her son is now 10 months old and perfectly healthy. the dr. told her its ok the baby is still so small that it doesnt really affect it but stop as soon as you think your pregnant or know your pregnant. good luck and congrats|`|FUNhlpiqaa	I did the same thing with my first... he is just fine.  Just stop now and things will be fine.|`|FTcx2lBHaa	With my daughter i drank in the beginning of my pregnancy because i didnt kno i was pregnant. I think i was 2 months when i knew i was pregnant because of irregular periods n so forth. Right now i have a healthy 2 year old, who is very intelligent. So once you stop drinking i dont think that its a problem..If your still not certain ask your doctor. Or look it up on the web.|`|VX8DlpzRaa	your baby is deff. dead. JK you'll be fine- dont worry GIRLFRIEND!|`|QAyuoz5aaa	just lay off now :)|`|5QDouy4Uaa	My period was already a week late on my 21st birthday but I honestly didn't think I was pregnant, I had a similar experience with a missing period a few months prior and wasn't pregnant then so I thought it was just late again. I went out and drank a lot because of all the free drinks I was getting (but I did keep throwing them up which I thought was odd because I'm no stranger to alcohol) but obviously a lot of the alcohol was still in my system and I am now 35 weeks pregnant. my baby is fine. I discussed this with my doctor and they said most woman drink before knowing they are pregnant and that I should not feel guilty or worry.|`|UIPZ8dshaa	If you've been partying every weekend and using excessive alcohol there's a chance your baby could have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. You can read more about it here:  <a href="http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fasd-etcaf/pubs/fs-fi_01-eng.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/fasd-etcaf/pu...</a>  I have worked with FAS kids before and some are wonderful, it just depends on whether there is an awareness of it so that you can have proper supports in place to deal with any special needs.  FAS is a spectrum disorder meaning there are varying degrees in how it affects each child.  Be sure to stop drinking now and you should definitely disclose this to your health care provider and read more about it so you have an understanding of how this could affect your infant.  There is no finite answer regarding how much alcohol needs to be consumed before it damages the brain but the official word is that there is no safe amount of alcohol to consume during pregnancy.  It's good that you know now though and can start taking care of the little one inside of you.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	there is nothing you can do about it now but make sure you do everything to protect your baby now that you know its there. everyone makes mistakes in early pregnancy especially because we dont know we are pregnant! How could we know. I personally was a smoker before i found out i was pregnant and i hate it but there is nothing i can do about it now so i dont stress about it because that is not good for our little ones either, the thing is that the studies out are about constant use throughout pregnancy and as long as you are not out binge drinking now things have an excellent chance of being perfectly normal. Good luck to you and make sure you take prenatal vitamins every day.
7jXChfBNaa	i would say that if you are trying to get pregnant to buy those ovulation kit tests. those are very accurate. because if you are just going off of your last period to determine ovulation dates they always give you a 2 week window, that is if you are using an ovulation calendar? also all women don't ovulate 2 weeks after their period so it is hard to say, that's why if you use a kit it is very accurate. if you were already pregnant the odds of you already having these pains are slim to none, being as it is so soon.
heC9aQ18aa	I like Audrey Katherine. Both are pretty feminine classy names. Ava is nice but it is awfully common these days especially in some parts of the country. Genevieve is nice too. Family names are important to me so no matter what they are wonderful. For the boys I like Nathaniel a lot and William. They are two of my favorites.  Nolan is okay but not  the best for my taste. Good luck with medical school and future children.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	I love all those names except Nolan, I have never like that name.<br>  And I would switch it to Ava Genevieve and Audrey Katherine. They just seem to go together better that way.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Absolutely Love the names !|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	i like all except for nolan|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	I love Nathaniel Charles (but would like Charles Nathaniel better). Ava is too popular right now. I've never really liked Audrey, though I love Genevieve. Nolan William is ok, but not a favorite. <br>  <br>  What about Genevieve Adele?|`|NePgB9b2aa	They're all wonderful except for Genevieve & Nolan. Audrey Guinevere & Noah William would be awesome! :)|`|OEMIkJTUaa	Good choices! They are all very unique and meaningful! And they all go well together!|`|okpAjss6aa	Audrey Genevieve<br>  Ava Katherine|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I love Ava Katherine!

CzKrqgmgaa	chances are you'll have lots of time to pack when your in labour but you'll probably want to have a doctor check you out as soon as possible so you know how dialated you are. if it were me I'd pack right away. My bags were packed at about 35 weeks... or semi packed anyways. My son came at 38 weeks but maybe it was because he knew I was ready to go LOL<br>  it cant hurt to have it ready to go though|`|DcLiW4bbaa	I didn't pack my bag until my water broke, lol. I was totally unprepared, but I went 8 days early so I thought I still had a little time.<br>  <br>  You should pack...trying to rush around and pack at the last minute sucks I can tell you from experience. I hope you pop soon, I remember how frustrating it was, telling my baby to hurry up, haha.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	lol packk that bagg.<br>  <br>  i had my sons bag and my bag packed for WEEKS before lol.  he came a day late and i felt like he was never coming.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i had my packet month before,,,|`|BM6veAseaa	3 days I was scheduled for my induction, I went into labor, and had not packed.  It did not help as I was trying to tell my mother and husband everything I needed, during my contractions, and was also confusing over the phone once I had the baby.  Save yourself some agony later, and pack now.  Good luck with your delivery, and wish you and your baby the best of health.  Congrats.|`|pYyIkljBaa	typically speaking, IF this is your first child. you will have loads of time to get the bag packed while you are in labor. but, from experience (i have 3 kids) while you are in labor, you are in a different zone, and you may easily forget essential items. so as tired and uncomfortable you are, you really do need to get going with your bag. get your partner/husband to help!|`|EKoRHgdgaa	I would pack the bag!  What if he comes and you have not packed your bag?!?  That would not be a good thing!|`|tIg3low2aa	I alway's had my bag packed and even now I keep it packed my husband and I to go a quick getaway! Pack the bag!|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	that has nothing to do with it i had just went out to but a bag on a friday & gave birth that monday but hadnt packed it yet.. <br>  but if ur 40 then yeah maybe u should packit|`|XWDNzHe7aa	Instead of writing that question, you could have packed your bag... lol. Just a thought.|`|RFo1lLXPaa	LOL. you better pack your bag before it's too late!|`|vbPOQ2KEaa	If this is your first, you'll have time to pack a bag, clean the house, watch tv, have dinner...    LOL!<br>  <br>  Anyway, with my first, it took 4 days from the first contractions. I didn't go to the hospital until about 12 hours before he came.<br>  <br>  My second was about 12 hours.<br>  <br>  Don't think he cares if you're packed, although when you finally do, it could be conceived as being "nesting" the need to get ready, which is usually a sign... For my "nesting", I cleaned out the refrigerator... LOL!<br>  For the second one, I was just cleaning the baby's room... she decided it was good enough, so she decided it was time to come.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and much love!|`|8WGxXA5vaa	I think its a good idea to be organised, it doesn't take much time to pack a bag it's not like your going for a holiday you only need essentials, PJ's, toiletries, slippers, underwear, bra, and your babies clothes, and (diapers the hospital will give you diapers if you forget to bring them) I mean that's pretty much it, if you happen to forget something no big deal just ask your partner or folks to get you things from home.<br>  <br>  You don't want to wait till the last minute cos you won't have time, you will be nervous about the labour and excited and you most def will forget things. Just pack it and get it out of the way 1 less thing for you to worry about. Maybe get a friend to help you?? Good luck with the birth.|`|FTcx2lBHaa	With my daughter i went into early labor and my bag wasn't packed. My mom actually had to look for my stuff and bring them to the hospital for me after wards. It wasn't as bad as i thought.|`|KzR2hFl3aa	um ur gunna end up with ur water breaking and being rushed to the hospitol with NOTHING paked, not fun.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Pack your bag, he is coming by the weekend for sure!! Good luck!|`|1hciyvKdaa	Not me,all three of my labors were one hour or less total!<br>  Maybe its time to start bribing baby with candy?!!<br>  Congradulations!!!!!!

You need to see a doctor if the pain is that bad. You may very well be going into labor early, and if you are it would be good if the doctor could stop it. It would be better to carry your baby for a few more weeks. Go to the doctor now!|`|AA11542929	i am having the same pains and i was talking to my doctor since i had an appt today and she said that to time them and they may be braxton hicks or the real thing.. so i dont know..
8Rn2pX4jaa	It is understandable that you are feeling guilty and your raging hormones are probably not helping!  But... he had a responsibility as well!  It is a two way street, and if he wanted to be absolutely certain to protect himself there are measures that he could have taken.  So please don't take the brunt of this decision.<br>  <br>  You should never feel guilty about the decision that you have made about keeping the baby.  You both can still pursue your dreams, it will just be a little bit more complicated than before.  Perhaps living with your parents is not the best solution.  <br>  <br>  The best way to show him how you feel is to have a candid and honest conversation with him about what you both want and what it means for your relationship and future family.  <br>  <br>  Big Hugs and best of luck!  It is not easy raising a child under perfect circumstances, and it will be a rough road ahead.  But you have made your decision, and you will have to do everything in your power to make it work for both of you.|`|PTLXDmG4aa	don't be so hard on yourself.. its not all about him.. you need to be thinking about you, something he obviously doens't seem to be doing.. but don't forget that you are the one carrying the baby so your attachment started long before his.. just wait until he sees the baby before you start thinking that his life is ruined.. he will love that baby just like you.... good on you for keeping the baby and putting it first before anything else in life.. it obviously came with sacrefices but your baby is lucky to have you as many ppl in your situation would have terminated..|`|XukXVsJvaa	Well I think he needs to man up I mean...its not all about him. Its about the baby and if u honestly feel hes upset that you didnt abort then youre better off without him. Maybe once the baby gets here hell change. Just give it time but please dont let him drag you down as well...its seriously the last thing you need right now.|`|iJZ43J0taa	Like the old saying goes, it takes two to tango. He was the one who decided to have sex with you. He knew the risk of pregnancy was there. No one is asking him to raise the baby, go to little league games, etc. But as the father, the only thing that's asked of him is child support. So don't feel guilty hon. Just because you're the one carrying the child, doesn't mean the blame and responsibility is all on you. It takes two to tango.|`|qG0jneVZaa	Ok. A) You can't show anybody that you love then if they have their mind set on something else. B) He should know that you love him if you guys have been together for 3 years and u r having his child and C) Did you use a condom? If not last time a checked it takes two to tango..so he should be resenting himself as well|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You don't need to do anything. When your baby is born he will fall in love with her. There is no reason for you to feel guilty, you both made the decision to have sex and babies are the natural result. He knew that.<br>  <br>  Do you have a "daddy's little girl" outfit for the baby yet? if not you need one. My husband loves the "my dad's cooler than your dad" stuff too.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	The easiest way to show him is by telling him guys usually need something more concrete for you to show your appreciation. you shouldnt feel guilty because you BOTH made the baby and I have plenty of respect for you for keeping it trust me an abortion would have you feeling more guilty forever. he will be okay once everything settles.|`|MOsStEbqaa	You need to just tell him that. If you don't want to say it to his face write a letter that way you can get what you need out and he will know how you feel.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	you didn't impregnate yourself.<br>  he made the choice to be with you.<br>  it is a lot for such young people to take on but that's life.|`|dPULl5hjaa	You can't make him do ANYTHING IF HE DOESN'T WANT TO !|`|FUNhlpiqaa	He is probably just scared about being a father.  This is a major change in your lives!  Hopefully, if he is a good guy, he will come around once the baby is here and you all settle into things (home, new job etc.).  You didn't ruin his life.  He is a big boy and know where babies come from.  Don't stress yourself out about how he feels.  You have a lot to deal with yourself!  You're 18 and going to be a mom!  If what you say is true and you didn't try and trap him or whatever then you have no reason to prove yourself to him.

2irmTjQ3aa	I am eighteen and my fiance and I really wanted a baby. I am still in college and we are doing great. My reason.. I wanted a baby, so I had sex and had a baby. Prior to this though I had been having sex for two years and always protected myself, I do not have much respect for teen moms who get pregnant on accident because they don't use protection.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Ugh judgemental people like you annoy me. Don't assume ALL teens have unprotected sex. No form of BC is 100% fool proof. And sex is very natural, everyone gets urges.<br>  I fell pregnant after using protection. I'm 19, her father is very much in the picture. I love being a mother and wouldn't change it for the world.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	well i am a teen mom <br>  i am sixteen and have a six month old and here is my background <br>  <br>  i meet my baby dad and we fell in love and had sex and we were in love and felt connected with out the use of a condom <br>  well we had sex for about a month and hello im pregnant at 14<br>  the begnning of my pregnancy was hard <br>  but i got thru it <br>  my mom was angry but after we heard the babys heart beat and saw it on my first ultrasound at ten weeks she was in love like i was the moment the test said pregnant <br>  <br>  it was not that hard being a pregnant teen at my school <br>  there are so many programs that helped me <br>  every one was nice to me <br>  i had lots of suppourt from my friends and made great new friends <br>  i discovered who i was during my pregnancy while taking as best care of my baby as i could <br>  i did everything to ensure my baby was safe and healthy <br>  i was aiming for a nine pound baby <br>  because i wanted my baby to be big and healthy <br>  i baby sat over the summer to raise money and my babys dad got a job 3 months into my pregnancy we had lots of donations from people <br>  so i hardly had to buy any of the big ticket items <br>  i discovered at bjs diapers are really cheap <br>  i discovered that target is my favorite store becuase of all of their great baby stuff <br>  i loved being pregnat <br>  and i did the best for a healthy pregnancy <br>  <br>  i went into labor aug 18 and my son was born the 19 <br>  it was a shock to me because although we never found out the sex of the baby i swore i was having a girl<br>  <br>  my son is my world <br>  his dad is very involved <br>  we are doing the best we can <br>  my son will not grow up in poverty <br>  he will not grow up with out a dad <br>  and he will not be another male in a jail cell <br>  he is thriving <br>  he is very smart <br>  <br>  i dont babysit any more after the summer was over i was to <br>  ( i even babysat 3 kids the day i came home from the hospital)<br>  <br>  it is tough but i have amazing support <br>  and my mom has helped me <br>  <br>  she does not in any way take care of Joey <br>  he is my responsability and i know that <br>  i will never pawn him off on any one he is mine and i love him to much to spend any more time away from him then i have to <br>  <br>  i do get help from the goverment <br>  but atleast my son is fed <br>  <br>  i did breastfeed for 4 months <br>  because it was the best 4 him <br>  <br>  he gets everything he needs and more <br>  i am still in school to make our future the best it can be <br>  <br>  and i am one of the few great teen moms out there <br>  <br>  joey saved me from a life of drugs and unhappiness <br>  <br>  i am now happy and have been drug free for  18+ months <br>  <br>  i say we are doing very well|`|lGcpXteaaa	I was 17 when i gave birth to my daughter. 18 Now.<br>  I LOVE being a mommy, its the best thing that happened to me. We get on just fine and people often comment on how amazing i am with my daughter. Including by a nurse at the hospital, she said i was an amazing mom compared to the other moms (which may i add were all over 25-30)<br>  Our sex was protected, we got pregnant on the birth control pill. We had been together since i was 14 so we were (are) in a loving, caring, trusting relationship. We fell pregnant and keeping my baby was the only option. We enjoyed all our pregnancy, we own our own house and car. We are still together now.<br>  He's 20, im 18, our daughter is 10 months and she has what any other child has...if not more!<br>  <br>  I DO find your question criticizing. You are trying to tell me you didnt have sex until you were 20? Bullshit..i dont call it. If you didnt, you obviously hadnt met the right person. <br>  And do you know that sexual urge is 100% natural? Its hard to fight your instinct to mate....and you know that sex makes babies right?<br>  Thats how its caused....<br>  Why dont you worry about yourself darling? Nobody cares about what pathetic people like you think!!|`|c2a0BgWraa	The only way to ensure that you will not get pregnant is abstinence. So please do not assume that because these young ladies are pregnant, that they did anything unprotected.  Why did they have sex at all? That's a stupid question. Also I doubt that they got pregnant on purpose..though I know of some teens that do. <br>  <br>  I twenty one and was not a teen mother.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Why is this directed just towards teen moms?<br>  What about adult moms?  Plenty of adults aren't ready for children either.<br>  How about teen fathers?<br>  Adult fathers?<br>  <br>  Hm..|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Sex is natural and your natural instincts dont care what your age is. Way back when people did not live as long and therfor had to have kids and get married at a younger age. Its just nature plain and simple (but to a point) people still have some self control but is easier for some more then others. Teen parents are NORMAL and there is nothing wrong with it as long as they can take care of their kids on there own without relying on others. one mistake, ok but some are haveing 4 or 5 kids by the time they are 16, 17 years old and that is just.........well stupid<br>  <br>  I got pregnant when i was 16 but had an abortion (medical reasons) but my sister who is 16 is now pregnant and going to be a teen mom and going through all of it, the father is still in the picture and she is living with me, she has a job and goes to school, and will be a great mom<br>  <br>  when i was a teen and got pregnant i used BC and Condoms and still got pregnant, and lol thats how i got knocked up this time, so not all teen parents just go out and have unprotected sex<br>  <br>  I think another reason why is lack of education, when i was 16 my sex ed class taught us nothing, we put a condom on a bananna and talked about std's and pregnancy for a day or two and that was it, there is so much more that needs to be talked about in schools. And condoms and birth control should be easier to get, some places wont sell condoms unless the person is 18 and birth control ,in some  places you need parental consent to go on it. But lack of education is a big reason why "it all happend"<br>  <br>  Mama Mia, lol you tell her = ^ )|`|9R1UtLjGaa	I was 14 when I became preganat, and am now almsot 16 with a 5 month old daughter. Being a teen mom is hard but it is just like anyother mom who has a baby.  No i did not have unproteted sex i always used safty but i guess tht doesnt always work. No the father left when i was 7 months prego, but am doing just fine without him.|`|b9OaXmmDaa	Well as of right now I am a pregnant 14 year old girl. I am going to keep the baby and try to do it on my own(with my bf). <br>  <br>  *I had unprotected sex because it feels like love what we have.(We are engaged....not the plans I had for myself, but it will do!) It was our 1 year anniversary and yea I put out and here I am!<br>  <br>  *The father of our baby has agreed to help.....I don't want people to take pity on me because I am happy.

I just wanted to feel loved, and I thought this would help(and it did....IDK what I would do without him!).I am not trying to make it sound like it is there fault btw.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It pisses me off when people judge me.  I know I made a mistake and it isn't there job to make it known to everyone what they think of me(and everyone else in my situation).

I am married, my husband is absolutely ecstatic about our new baby!!|`|5i1J2RLLaa	I am not a teen mother and I am not planning on being one.<br>  <br>  But 99% of the time it is cause by pure irresponsibility <br>  <br>  Unless (which is rare) she wants a kid.|`|BT4wna2Vaa	1) It is extremely difficult, because you have to go to school and take care of a child, and you have to grow up way faster than anyone else could possibly imagine. I had my daughter 2 days before 16 (unfortunately, because that's the only thing I had going for me, because 16 sounds way better than 15) and she is now 10 months old, but I imagine it would be the same as having a baby and having a job at the same time for adults, minus the maturity level.<br>  2) Funny story, the only time I actually made him wear a condom is when I ended up pregnant. At first I didn't think it was necessary because I didn't ever think it could happen to me, you know how everyone says that. Then, I lost interest in him so I told him that he either needed to wrap it up, or he wasn't getting anything from me. And that's when I got pregnant.<br>  3) The "Sperm Donor", as we call him, plays no part whatsoever in my daughter's life. I made that choice when I found out I was pregnant. I knew he was irresponsible, and I knew what was best for her, so I decided to leave him. Though he made attempts while I was pregnant to harrass me, in the beginning I ended up with a black eye, but he had been sneaking up to me while I was at his school in the mornings threatening me, and the last time he did that a week later I was going into preterm labor due to stress. He only knows that she exists because his father called the record of deeds or something like that. He doesn't know what she looks like, and thankfully, she looks like me.<br>  4) I think that I started having sex because I figured it was the only thing I could do that would make anyone happy with me. I have committment issues and abandonment issues, I'm not afraid to admit that those are probably factors in why I left him. My dad has been gone from my life since I was 4, and my mom used to just leave us at my sisters to go party it up. I guess I just wanted to feel loved.<br>  I wouldn't trade my little girl for the world, and if I knew that in 3 years I could have her exactly the way she is, then I would have waited. <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.<br>  I tried.|`|KZN5wzyRaa	omg these people are not helping teen mums but for mr it wasn't all that unprotected we were both checked for stds knew we were fine, went out for a long time, i was on the pill and it failed!<br>  <br>  for other teen mums i guessitss the normall reasonss an that, the condom slippedd, hey got caught in the heat of the moment or they simply did not care!<br>  <br>  for me the father of my chid passed away but had he been here i know he wound face up to his responsibility's as all father no matter what age should, and girl is the father isn't willing to do this then your better off without him!<br>  <br>  and jut a few words of wisdom just because someone is young does not make them bad parents i for one love my little girl to bits and do not regreta her for a minute! just please remember to be carefull and safe and think about everything before you have sex and if you do fine yourself in a place where a baby is coming take care of it, the baby did not ask to be born but once its here all you can do is love it and care for ir!<br>  <br>  remember it's nt the end of the world and to be safe!<br>  <br>  I hoped i helped aoife x.x.x|`|JLxcKQ5laa	Some of these answers are just silly... for instance<br>  <br>  "I have found many people don't use condums cause its imbarrassing plus some guys will say anything to convince a girl that he can't get her pregnant saying stuff like "Doc says i can't have kids" or "You can't get pregnant if i ....."

That way the little ones develop a taste for the veggies and then you move on to fruit.  But green beans and peas are a good choice.  Be prepared that he may not love it at first because it's not sweet like fruit or breastmilk so you'll need to offer it 5 days in a row to help him develop at taste for it.
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	it sounds alot like the rash my son got from his baby shampoo and our laundry detergent.  we now use baking soda for baths and arm and hammer sensitive skin for detergent.<br>  <br>  as always, you can call the nurse on call.  they don't charge for that.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	take him in when the office is open and have it checked out..|`|90zcKChJaa	If you can blanch the rash spots, then it's not so serious, but if you take the skin around a spot and pull the skin apart (tighten) the skin and you can still see spots then you should bring him in sooner than later.<br>  <br>  I took my daughter in last year and that's what they told me.<br>  <br>  Good luck! ;)

WxHVK1k0aa	My best advice would be to tap him back.  Show him that you are just as good as he is.  More or less like you still are in control.  If he's tapping on you, fight back in a playful way.  That will show him that you have a good personality, are have similar actions.  It won't show that your copying him, it will just say that you can have just as much fun playing his game.  It will lure him to see who you really are.  And the comments like "why are you looking at my butt" they're just silly play talk, do be afraid to say some playful back talk to show that your able to keep in the loop, and he isn't the only one playing his game.  It will let him see your type of personality by the way you approach his actions.

My parents didn't have my little brother start babysitting until he was 13 and he's still pretty immature (the kids always whine when my parents have to have him babysit because they say he goes on a power trip and is mean). <br>  <br>  So if you think he's mature enough, I say go for it. But, start off small... you and your husband go to the grocery store and leave him with his sibling, etc so they he's not shocked with a 3.5 hour sitting session. Make sure he's OK changing diapers, not just that he can do it but that he's not so grossed out that he'll avoid it. Basically, he needs to learn how to handle the unexpected little things that don't necessarily require calling you home (ie baby is having a crying fit or older child is just being ornery).<br>  <br>  I think after a couple short baby-sitting trials, he'll be just fine. You'll be right down the street, and with cell phones and land lines he'll be able to reach you if something happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and happy birthday to your son!:-)|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	i would let him maybe when its 8 or 8:30 you should have someone help him with bed time and other stuff.
3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Not a parent yet, but a teacher...<br>  <br>  You are absolutely right.  The curriculum continues to push more advanced ideas on younger ages.  And no, this is not always a good thing.  A prime example is when 3rd or 4th graders are introduced to algebra concepts, which requires abstract thinking.  Children do not start to think in that way until about 12 years of age.  In some ways, we are pushing them beyond what they are capable of...that only leads to frustration and mentally shutting down.<br>  <br>  Anyway, much of this change is due to the completely idiotic NCLB act.  I'm not sure WHY we allow people that haven't been in a classroom since they graduated to make important decisions on our nation's education system...but we do.|`|Knierqi9aa	Yes and no.  My oldest is in 2nd grade and it sure seems like the work is advacned, altho she is doing very well.  I think the difference is that there are so many "purchased programs" available to schools today.  For example, we all learned to read using phonics...well that is old news and my daughter's school uses "Saxon Reading Program", whcih teaches it a little differently.  Yea, sometimes I feel stupid when I look at her math worksheets...like what the heck do these directions mean?|`|Jb1qmm1Eaa	OMG...yes!! My son is in kinder as well, every night he has homework. We have to read at least a chapter out of a book (7/10 pages) (and its not like the old "See Jane Run") in addition to written homework. Just today his homework is Math...WORD PROBLEMS....If Kim lost 3 teeth and Adam lost 2...Together how many did the children lose? The worksheet has at least 8 word problems. Plus 12 math problems 12 +3...6 +5..ETC.<br>  <br>  I think i had that word problem in 1st/2nd grade. I thought it was a bit much, but glad he is getting a head start on learning. Just don't want them shoving it down these little kids so fast. There is so much expected of a 5 year old these days. Glad you brought this up...i was wondering about it too!|`|BhUSOu0Eaa	I don't think so.<br>  It is very good that you're child will get advanced at such an early age.<br>  Imagine how he will do in more advanced classes sand then collage!<br>  <br>  Personally, I think the curriculum is to easy. But that is just my opinion. Hope this helps!|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	This is called globalisation.|`|YW74O9aNaa	Yes, i agree. <br>  The reason is that most kids go to preschool nowadays or their parents teach them at home from like 2yrs age :) and they already know a lot before they join kindergarten. <br>  <br>  Its good too because kids this age learn very fast.<br>  <br>  My 2 yr old already knows the alphabet, colours and numbers.. i haven't taught him anything he just learnt that from Dora, Super Why TV shows like that.<br>  <br>  My son is in kindergarten and already reading well, counting, he's even figured out multiplication and does it for small numbers :) They were even having elections at school and voted for their candidate and watched Obama inaugutarion live. <br>  <br>  I didn't even know my postal address at that age :D<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Oh no this doesn't   take the play away from them :) Remember kindergarten is still 3 hours a day and rest of the day for play :) my son's school doesn't even give homwork. At least i don't think public schools are that strict.. don't know much about private schools though.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	It has changed. I learned to read in 1st grade, it's now done in kindergarten. I remember learning multiplication in 3rd grade, that's now in 2nd.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	yes K is now first grade material|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Yes, they have changed schools since we were attending....they essentially put first grade into kindergarten and by 2nd grade they are down to serious business!  <br>  <br>  Truthfully I'm not sure that they are accomplishing much by doing this, and I wish they would invest more time and energy into creative teaching instead of repeating the same old same old.  I think that teaching today should include more hands-on and interactive material and reach a broad range of learning styles.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Oh, wow same kindergaten teachers! Yes, i've noticed this! The kids have so many tests to make shure that the school is complying with the whole "no child left behind act" that they have to start things earlier then they did when we were in school. Also they have to have many more credits to graduate in school now then when i was in school!|`|Tc23KWgzaa	I think, yes, that the curriculum is far more challenging, and that's good for the gifted student--they can soar (after they have their nervous breakdowns).  Not every child is ready for that, though, and the pressure may take away from the pleasure at school.<br>  <br>  TX Mom|`|gW0nD5cEaa	It's kind of ironic, the younger kids seem to be ahead of what kids were previously, but by the time they get to high school, some, not all kids are behind. It depends on the kids, the school district, etc. But kids need an edge today, we are not only competing with other Americans, but Japanese, Germans, Chinese, etc. on a global market. They are often ahead of us.<br>  <br>  Like somebody said, a lot of parents work with their kids at home and they also watch "Sesame Street" and things like that, so it is not like the first time they were exposed to the alphabet was in Kindergarten or first grade. Kids from bigger families always picked up a little of the alphabet and counting from older kids, but they might not have really been taught, today there is a lot of teaching. Many kids also go to pre-school and I imagine it is what Kindergarten used to be and Kindergarten is more like what 1st grade was.

More on weight gain. Average weight gain for breastfed babies:<br>  0 - 4 mo  6 oz /week  4 - 6 mo  4 - 5 oz/week  6 - 12 mo  2 - 4 oz/week<br>  WET DIAPERS: 4 - 5+ sopping wet diapers per day.<br>  To feel what a sufficiently wet diaper is like, pour 4-6 tablespoons (60-90 mL) of water into a clean diaper (if baby wets more often, then the amount of urine per diaper may be less). Diapers may be wetter in the morning, especially with older babies. Urine should be pale and mild smelling.<br>  DIRTY DIAPERS: Depends on your child.<br>  Number ranges from many per day to one every 7 – 10+ days. After 4 - 6 weeks, some babies switch to an infrequent stooling pattern. This is normal as long as baby is gaining well, and stools are soft and profuse if several days have passed. More on infant stooling.<br>  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS: After a feeding, mom’s breast feels softer and baby seems reasonably content. Baby is alert, active and meeting developmental milestones.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDec97Jan98p123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.llli.org//llleaderweb/LV/LVDe...</a><br>  In answer to the question, "Is baby getting enough?" a second question could be posed, "Enough of which?" In the early weeks wet diaper counts give only part of the answer. Because the nursing newborn takes in plenty of foremilk before receiving the richer hindmilk, it would be difficult for an infant to produce several bowel movements per day without being adequately hydrated.<br>  <br>  However, the opposite can easily occur. Since feeding practices, ineffective sucking or other problems may diminish the mother's milk supply or prevent the baby from receiving an adequate portion of hindmilk, it is possible for a baby to be adequately hydrated yet have an inadequate calorie intake. Frequent urination remains one valid indicator of adequate newborn hydration from foremilk intake. Multiple daily stooling is an indicator of adequate newborn calorie intake from hindmilk. Both factors are needed to fully assess neonatal breastfeeding.<br>  <br>  Since a lack of daily stooling may be associated with inadequate newborn calorie intake, it is also a predictor of poor infant weight gain. Early detection of this symptom can be crucial for the baby's health and the continuation of breastfeeding. In severe cases, an infant's low calorie intake may lead to weaker sucking, diminished milk supply and critical dehydration. While less serious conditions may be improved at various stages of breastfeeding, it is much more effective to establish a generous milk supply and hearty weight gain in the early weeks than to have to work to achieve them in later months.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-supply.html#supply" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...</a><br>  Is your milk supply really low?<br>  <br>  First of all, is your milk supply really low? Often, mothers think that their milk supply is low when it really isn't. If your baby is gaining weight well on breastmilk alone, then you do not have a problem with milk supply.<br>  It's important to note that the feel of the breast, the behavior of your baby, the frequency of nursing, the sensation of let-down, or the amount you pump are not valid ways to determine if you have enough milk for your baby.<br>  <br>  What if you're not quite sure about baby's current weight gain (perhaps baby hasn't had a weight check lately)? If baby is having an adequate number of wet and dirty diapers then the following things do NOT mean that you have a low milk supply:<br>  <br>      * Your baby nurses frequently. Breastmilk is digested quickly (usually in 1.5-2 hours), so breastfed babies need to eat more often than formula-fed babies. Many babies have a strong need to suck. Also, babies often need continuous contact with mom in order to feel secure. All these things are normal, and you cannot spoil your baby by meeting these needs.<br>      * Your baby suddenly increases the frequency and/or length of nursings. This is often a growth spurt. The baby nurses more (this usually lasts a few days to a week), which increases your milk supply. Don't offer baby supplements when this happens: supplementing will inform your body that the baby doesn't need the extra milk, and your supply will drop.<br>      * Your baby nurses more often and is fussy in the evening.<br>      * Your baby doesn't nurse as long as she did previously. As babies get older and better at nursing, they become more efficient at extracting milk.<br>      * Your baby is fussy. Many babies have a fussy time of day - often in the evening. Some babies are fussy much of the time. This can have many reasons, and sometimes the fussiness goes away before you find the reason.<br>      * Your baby guzzles down a bottle of formula or expressed milk after nursing. Many babies will willingly take a bottle even after they have a full feeding at the breast. Read more here from board-certified lactation consultant Kathy Kuhn about why baby may do this and how this can affect milk supply. Of course, if you regularly supplement baby after nursing, your milk supply will drop (see below).<br>      * Your breasts don't leak milk, or only leak a little, or stop leaking. Leaking has nothing to do with your milk supply. It often stops after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * Your breasts suddenly seem softer. Again, this normally happens after your milk supply has adjusted to your baby's needs.<br>      * You never feel a let-down sensation, or it doesn't seem as strong as before. Some women never feel a let-down. This has nothing to do with milk supply.<br>      * You get very little or no milk when you pump. The amount of milk that you can pump is not an accurate measure of your milk supply. A baby with a healthy suck milks your breast much more efficiently than any pump. Also, pumping is an acquired skill (different than nursing), and can be very dependent on the type of pump. Some women who have abundant milk supplies are unable to get any milk when they pump. In addition, it is very common and normal for pumping output to decrease over time. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protocol_increase_bmilk_intake.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/b-protoco...</a><br>  Here is the way I suggest mothers proceed for "insufficient milk supply" (actually, most mothers have lots or could have had lots, but the problem is that the baby is not getting the milk that is available).<br>  <br>     1.<br>        Get the best latch possible. This needs to be shown by someone who knows what they are doing. Anyone can look at the baby at the breast and say the latch is good. The accompanying diagram shows how to get a good latch. If a mother has plenty of milk, the latch does not have to be perfect. But, if the milk supply is decreased, the baby will get more milk if he is latched on better. Get good “hands on” help. Videos can be seen at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html that show you how to best latch a baby on.<br>  <br>     2.<br>        Know how to know the baby is getting milk. When a baby is getting milk (he is not getting milk just because he has the breast in his mouth and is making sucking movements), you will see a pause at the point of his chin after he opens to the maximum and before he closes his mouth, so that one suck is (open mouth wide-->pause-->close mouth). If you wish to demonstrate this to yourself, put your index or other finger in your mouth and suck as if you were sucking on a straw. As you draw in, your chin drops and stays down as long as you are drawing in. When you stop drawing in, your chin comes back up. This pause that is visible at the baby's chin represents a mouthful of milk when the baby does it at the breast. The longer the pause, the more the baby got. Once you know about the pause you can cut through so much of the nonsense breastfeeding mothers are being told—such as “Feed the baby twenty minutes on each side”. A baby who does this type of sucking (with the pause) for twenty minutes straight might not even take the second side. A baby who nibbles (doesn't drink) for 20 hours will come off the breast hungry. You can see this “pause” on the videos at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html<br>  <br>     3.<br>        Once the baby is no longer drinking on his own, use compression to increase flow to the baby. Compression can be particularly helpful, but don't forget trying to get the best latch possible first. Babies tend to pull at the breast when the flow of milk is slow, so it is useful to know how to know the baby is actually getting milk and not just sucking without getting milk. When the baby no longer seems to be getting milk, and is sucking without getting milk, this is when to start compression, while the baby sucks, but does not drink. Keep the baby on the first breast until he doesn't drink even with compression. See handout #15 Breast Compression. You can see this how to use compression on the videos at www.thebirthden.com/Newman.html<br>  <br>     4.<br>        When the baby no longer drinks even with compression, switch sides and repeat the process. Keep going back and forth as long as the baby gets reasonable amounts of milk at the breast.<br>  <br>     5.<br>        Try fenugreek and blessed thistle. These two herbs seem to increase milk supply and increase rate of milk flow. There is more information on the handout #24 Cabbage Leaves, Herbs, Lecithin.<br>  <br>     6.<br>        In the evening when babies often want to be at the breast for long periods, get help to position the baby so that you can feed lying down. Let the baby nurse and maybe you will fall asleep. Or rent videos and let the baby nurse while you watch.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksupply/fenugreek.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksuppl...</a><br>  Effect on milk production<br>  <br>  Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.) appears to be the herb that is most often used to increase milk supply.

If it doesn't work for you then you could try the fenugreek by itsellf along with pumping after each breastfeeding.  Don't worry if no milk comes out while pumping, it still provides stimulation for your breasts to produce more milk.  Good luck!|`|z6IekuwSaa	It works.

It is rid by treating for pathogens and toxins, thus that is the cause.  The going theory amongst legendary autism docs, is that pleomorphic bacteria, like lyme, damages the immune system, along with toxins from the food, vaccines, air, everywhere.  They can not detox nor handle immune stress due to already being over-burdened with pleomorphic bacteria like lyme and Bartonella.  Like those with AIDS, that have a pleomorphic virus, but do not show illness until they are very sick due to the damage the virus does to the immune system.  This is the same with pleomorphic bacteria.  These kids don't show illness, like get stomach viruses and such.  They do get chronic runny noses though, and chronic diarrhea or constipation.  But, basically, their immune systems are over-burdened, but they still look fine, until they start stock-piling more pathogens and toxins due to the damaged immune system.  This is why the vaccines trigger them and they develop symptoms.|`|AA10317675	Genetics is the first part.  It looks like a child will not be autistic if he doesn't have the genes that make him vulnerable to autism.  But it also looks like, at least in 25% of the cases, there needs to be a trigger that turns a normal child into an autistic child.<br>  <br>  First off, 25% of autistic kids developed completely normally until between the age of 2 & 3 years old.  Then they regress, losing words, starting to rock & "stim" & losing eye contact.<br>  This is where the theory of vaccinations come in.  I am skeptical but have not ruled out that theory.<br>  <br>  But your child is 7 months old.<br>  Rocking or starring at hands is normal at that age so that can't help you.<br>  And, of course, your little boy is not yet verbal.<br>  So that just leaves social skills.<br>  <br>  Does he make eye contact?<br>  Shy kids will look, then look away, shyly peeking back to see if you are still looking at him.<br>  Autistic kids just seem indifferent to whether you are looking at him are not.  No eye contact.<br>  <br>  As far as vaccinations are concerned, I think kids should have all their vaccinations, but I think the schedule is too aggressive.  Give him all his vaccines, but after the age of two.  Maybe even 3.<br>  <br>  Vaccinations are tough on little bodies even without the autism scare.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	All women start lactating during pregnancy.  Usually by about half way through.<br>  <br>  There's not much point in pumping and storing colostrum.  There's no harm in it though, it won't cause preterm labour and it won't "use up" the colostrum<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/05pumping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nursingtwo/faq/0...</a><br>  Is it safe to use a breastpump during pregnancy?<br>  <br>  It is often stated that a woman should not use a breastpump when pregnant. However, there is considerable reason to believe that pumping, like breastfeeding, will not trigger preterm labor in a healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  When contemplating pumping during pregnancy, it is important to consider your motives for doing so. In general, when it comes to pumping during pregnancy, your efforts are best directed elsewhere unless you are pumping to provide milk for your current nursling.<br>  <br>      * If you are pumping to provide milk for your current nursling when you are separated, this should not pose more of a problem than breastfeeding. Many working moms continue to pump through pregnancy, although pumping output will decrease due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy. Aim to keep your pumping in scale with what you were doing before pregnancy, or in scale with your baby's normal breastfeeding. Sustained and intense pumping is more of an unknown and is not recommended.<br>      * If you wish to put some expressed milk in the freezer for your unborn child, keep in mind that pumping is not likely to be very productive during pregnancy. Milk supply and pumping output will decrease due to the hormonal changes of pregnancy.<br>      * Pumping prior to birth will not increase milk production for your unborn child or otherwise enhance lactation after birth.<br>      * If you are hoping to induce labor, it is known that nipple stimulation at term (38+ weeks) can be helpful for ripening the cervix and inducing labor.|`|FLpMShKNaa	Well, I suppose you could, but there is a danger that using a breast pump could cause premature labor, so it might not be a good idea until you are close to your due date. Also, usually even women who leak before birth don't have their milk really come in for a few days, it is easier on your body to establish your supply by nursing vs. pumping. Talk to your OB about it. Congrats on your upcoming baby. :)|`|FTcx2lBHaa	Some mothers who adapts takes pills to produce milk to give to the baby. So i would think that your milk which is natural can be pumped and stored. If your not certain ask your doctor on your next visit..You can also use a warm cloth, and put it on your breast to stop your breast from leaking..|`|z6IekuwSaa	I was told it will make you go into labor to stimulate your nipples. I'm not sure how true that is. But I'm pretty sure that until you have the baby you're only gonna get colostrum
ioTPGLRwaa	talk to your dr maybe he could donate it to someone who cant afford it (if its unopened and still good) how much is that med? i was looking it up on walgreens.com and it said 14,000.00?is that reall ythat price?omg that is outragous!could you email me i wanna know that is so high....|`|3zg7oBA5aa	I don't think you should sell any medication online.  What I do with medication I don't need anymore is A) Keep it or B) dump it out in the cat litter.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  If it's that expensive, for sure talk to your doctor about it.|`|knwKU1W2aa	maybe resale? people will buy just about anything on line.

I paid for the connection before I hit the financial hardship. If I cancel my subscription I do not get that money back plus we use the internet for my other halfs work purposes, doing the groceries and paying the bills. It is cheaper for us to do these thing online rather than spending the $50 a week in petrol to go into town and do them especially when you consider our internet bill is $50 a month!|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Maybe somebody else pays their bill.  Maybe its the only thing that keeps them connected.  My boyfriends parents dont have tv, just internet to  keep up on news and keep up with friends and family.

Its hard times for some.|`|z6IekuwSaa	Hell Yeah! Rock on girl! I totally agree with you. I hated it when I was a waitress and people would complain about the economy. Hello! Then why are you here at a restaurant?<br>  <br>  <br>  And if they aren't paying for their internet but they are still on it using someone elses they need to get off not the internet, but freakin yahoo answers and look for a job!|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	And how the HELL do you know the internet is from their home?  They may be at the LIBRARY, or SCHOOL or a FRIEND'S house.  Unless you're God, you don't know, so back the hell off!|`|pAhV0GGJaa	I 100% agree.

Because they are getting bigger. Although in the earlier weeks it may not be picked up because baby is very small. (this is the one you are askingabout the fetal doppler)<br>  26 weeks : Pinards Stethescope<br>  36 weeks : By Ear <br>  <br>  And baby can hear you speaking from week 26.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	No, usually 15-17 weeks they can hear you faintly, but more so at 27 weeks =) Im not sure about the store bought thing but at the doctor you can hear your babys heart beat with the doppler|`|3NoDjKLoaa	you can hear the heartbeat now on a "store bought thing" its an amazing thing to hear.  Although your first question is not going to be for a while.. after 6 mos usually, thats when the baby is big enough to "hear you" although you have to remember that he/she will know your voice much more because it echos inside you.. its very loud to them.. any other noises from the outside of the belly are waterlogged.. so its not so clear.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	My husband and I could only hear our son's heartbeat twice through one othe "store bought things" - and that was in the 36th week of pregnancy (he was born at 38 weeks).|`|NV5CQU8Taa	NO. Only after 27 weeks.|`|Lr6uYg8paa	No your baby cant hear you you have to be bout 22 weeks I am 24 weeks pregnant and my baby kicks every time she hears her daddy's voice! Its really neat when they do start responding to voices!

5WP9rLTlaa	My brother did something similar when he was little, our family doctor said that it was because he is a kinetic learner and cannot learn while sitting still. If all your boy is doing is pacing, count yourself lucky, my brother literally bounced all over the room! Must be why nobody in the family watches TV anymore|`|wE5JMeesaa	I can't imagine sitting my child in front of a television long enough to notice they were pacing.|`|1enIWBGnaa	For one, he should NOT be watching TV.  He needs to interactive with you and learning educational things.
3NoDjKLoaa	depends on your genetics and if you work out while pregnant and your plans for after the baby.. if you are going to breastfeed, it wont take too long, breastfeeding burns a lot of calories, plus you are on a special diet, so you are still very healthy.. if you started to do some light work outs after the baby, you should be back to normal by december.. <br>  <br>  I am the same way (very petite).. although i didnt breastfeed.. i lost 30 lbs before leaving the hospital and then the rest just melted off in less than 3 mos. People said they would have never guessed i had a baby.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	It all depends on your age exercise level resilience of your body etc. lt only took me about 9 weeks or so but everyones body is different. l would say anywhere from 6-16 weeks on average. good luck!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Breastfeed. I heard it works wonders =D|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I'm pretty thin, and it took me about 6 months with my first baby, and a year with my second...but I wasn't trying very hard, either. I'm sure if you exercise after your body recovers you will return to shape soon. Also, if you breastfeed, it can happen even sooner.|`|qLkknQx1aa	it all depends on you.  if you are an eater then it will take longer, if you aren't a snacker and are fairly active, you should be okay.  but everyone is different. - i was 110 pre-baby. was 33 when i had my son and 35 when i had my daughter. i gained 60 lbs with both pregnancies, i was a total snack queen.... i was at 120 about 3 months after baby #2 and that's where i'm at today. but i think it's because i spent most of my time chasing my son around the house all the time when i wasn't caring for the baby.
F4xIEr1daa	about $250 i think, I live in California.|`|vCWVimTzaa	I know the doctors fee was 100, and i think the hospital has their own fee too, I think around 100-150. so I guess 250 for the whole thing sounds about right. I haven't got the bill yet though, so I cant be completely sure|`|hrMhhB4Saa	nothing my insurance covered it.. i think its normally around 300|`|CdodhnP5aa	I just had my sons done last month and paid 200 at the pediatrician's office.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	$125...i live in missouri|`|CzKrqgmgaa	My son's was $200. BC Canada|`|pXSKSS3daa	Not a dime. I guess that's one of the benefits of my husband being in the military.<br>  <br>  That stinks, though. See if you can set up a payment plan for it, some do allow that.|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	Mine was covered by insurance but I saw the bill and it was billed for $250.|`|58b352907ba2def5e2248c3df2e55128aa	I can't remember exactly how much our doctor charged, but it was between $200 and $300.|`|5M5vt5Rnaa	lol. i didnt know until after it was all said and done and got a bill for $680.  Ill be paying it off for awhile..|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	That sounds about right. Our sons' were somewhere between $250 and $350.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Do you know why insurance doesn't cover it?<br>  It's because there is NO medical reason to do it. None. It's not healthier, or cleaner, it doesn't prevent infections or STD's. Those are all myths that were disproven a long time ago.<br>  <br>  There is no reason to do it.<br>  So why do it?<br>  <br>  As a guy I hate the decision my parents made for me. If it was left up to me I would have made a much better choice than they did.<br>  <br>  It's your son's body, it's attached to him.<br>  He should make the decision.<br>  <br>  Also do you know how much seneitivity is lost with a circumcision. 2/3 of the penils nerves are cut off with a circumcision. And new studies are showing a 40% decrease in sensitivity for males.<br>  To me sexual feeling and pleasure is a birth right that I should have right now.<br>  I am naturaly restoring my foreskin, I don't get 100% of the feeling back but I can tell you that what I do get back is A LOT. Orgasms are stronger and last longer when you are uncircumcised. There is so much feeling lost that a lot of men don't realize.<br>  <br>  Honestly I beg you to look into it more.<br>  I hate the decision that was made and I know a ton of men that feel the same way.<br>  <br>  Also the circumcision rate is low, 50% so don't do it because he might be "left out". Half the boys or more will be uncircumcised.<br>  <br>  I urge you to think about leaving the choice up to him.<br>  It's him body and his penis, shouldn't he get a vote in it?<br>  <br>  If he wants it done later he can go get it done.<br>  And it's not as mad as people make it sound like as an adult. It's better to get it done as an adult anyways.<br>  <br>  -Connor
1thzSbS8aa	Plan B's website says it prevents pregnancy for 7 out of 8 women who would otherwise have become pregnant. 7 out of 8 works out to a percentage of 89%. So let's round that up to 90%. That means there's a 1 in 10 chance of failure.<br>  <br>  However, it can also mess up your menstrual cycle.<br>  <br>  BUY a pregnancy test and use it first thing in the morning. Pregnancy hormones are the  most concentrated in first morning urine.|`|wrzUD1rMaa	6. How effective is Plan B?? <br>  <br>  Plan B? works better the sooner you use it. If it is taken as directed within 72 hours (3 days) after unprotected sex, it can significantly decrease the chance that you will become pregnant. About 7 out of every 8 women who would have gotten pregnant will not become pregnant. Plan B? works even better if taken within the first 24 hours after unprotected sex|`|feUtQ0GBaa	okay first off<br>  never use plan B again. Seriously that stuff messes up ur whole reproductive system. If u use it more than 3 times in ur life ur not gonna be able to have a baby when ur older and actually want one.<br>  What plan b does is completly destroy everything in ur ovaries so that a baby wont be able to survive. U probably misssed your period because of this. It might take ur body a while to get back on schedule. just wait it out and if u go a really long time without ur period then go to ur doctor.|`|AA10411777	The reason I would assume you haven't started is because you are stressing out just try and calm down also lack of food intake will cause you to miss your period. Plan B is pretty affective so i wouldn't worry so much it will probably start soon|`|l1STgPyRaa	the reading on it saying 87% good that it will be ok
F6pD9tEvaa	15 is old enough, a girl i sit near in mat got hers done (and it looks amazing) and she is 15, I believe she went into Blue Banana, but if they do it, im sure anywhere will do it for you. The only problem is, you may need to have a parent with youfor them say you are allowed.<br>  <br>  She said it didnt hurt at all, but her tongue swelled a bit, but that went down after an hour.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also, I hear girls with their tongues pierced make great kissers, so hve fun :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it goes well, don't be nervous, xx|`|r39EDGhPaa	I hear it doesn't hurt much at all.<br>  It just gets swollen for a little while, and you have to be careful not to accidentally bite on it or something.  When it heals it will be fine.  Just make sure you keep it clean.<br>  <br>  You have to be 16 with parental permission where I'm at.  I'm not sure about the UK.|`|A3zAXntxaa	You probably have to be up to 16 or 18 to be without a parent.<br>  I would imagine it hurts a bit more then the navel. <br>  Keep it sanitary. Good luck.|`|115BfzMFaa	Im 17 and live in the uk. I had my navel done when i was 13 and didn't feel a thing, i actually told the piercer not to do it and he said that he hoped i was kidding because he has done it. Now with the tongue, i had that done at 16, it didn't hurt having it done, but eating and drinking for a week afterwards is a nightmare, it really swells and hurts. Once the bar is changed it is ok though. I think you should think careully and check for the best piercers around your area as one slip of the needle and you could bleed to death. There is a main vein in the tongue. I think you have to be 18 to get the tongue done in the uk or have parents permissin. I went with my friend and her mum to get mine done. My friends mum signed. Also get parents permission, my dad went mad with me. Think the piercer thought my friends mum was my mum. ooops lol. good luck x|`|pAhV0GGJaa	Tongue does not hurt.  You'd think it would because when you bite your tongue it feels awful, but it really doesn't.  I hear that the bellybutton is on of the most painful, so if you can handle that, you'll be fine.|`|X2ADohmtaa	for the UK...I think at the age of 16 or 18|`|58riODTmaa	18|`|n0uwYsGIaa	go ahead and get it it dont matter how old u have to be i knoe like 10 girls with the piercing there and.......other places and they are your age its up to u depending on where u get urs from a friend or shop

dMv8X2nIaa	i had a ectopic PG and got the MTX shot on 8/5/08. My numbers to start with were 3973. I didnt hit zero until 10/13. I know the waiting is unbearable! Hope everything clears up soon for you..9 is very very close.|`|icgTII3Maa	Based on research conducted with 77 women who had an ectopic pregnancy, around 74 women were successfully treated with methotrexate. They started with average beta levels of 2592±3771 IU/L with a mass size of about 2-3 cm. It took an average of 1-6 weeks for everything to clear.<br>  <br>  Since the duration of treatment is dependent on the initial beta levels and size, if you are already at 9, I would give it a week or two weeks more.
AxqFNFCSaa	My daughter had the same thing when she was a baby....scary I know but it is from the hormones. If I remember hers were like that until she was about a year old. She is 3 now and she is completely fine. Definitely ask the doctor when you go for some added reassurance but it is normal.|`|qxnZXOVFaa	it's normal.  both my girls had this and it scared the crap out of me!  maybe this link will help.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/parenting/your-newborn-baby-breast-lumps" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/parenting/your-newb...</a>|`|AA11599282	Yep, just mommy hormones in the body still.  My BOY had them and I could actually express milk out of them if squeezed (you're not supposed to)  But, never be afraid to ask your pediatrician anything.  Big Kisses!!|`|dW4DbkCLaa	I asked my dr. about this at my baby's 4 month checkup and it is normal, all the way up to 12 months old. They will disappear. My daughter has the same thing.|`|RcchpBX5aa	Take her to the Doctor. I didn't waste time like this when I was unsure about something with my child.... No doctor will think your crazy for coming in. If your concerned enough to ask, you should go!|`|16vwEBiqaa	I'm guessing they are just the glands. If your appointment wasn't next week I would have recommended calling. Def. ask if you are worried.
WPI0Z47saa	If your are stressed and tense while holding her, this will make her cry. I noticed this with my son and his aunt would take him and he would stop. They can sense your stress and aggravation.|`|QfYGhtVwaa	Maybe she wants you to leave her alone so she can sleep?, you could try that. Cry-sis is a UK helpline that can probably answer your question much better than me. Just in case she is unwell, I would seek Professional advice.<br>  <br>  Warm bath is a good idea - could tire her out.<br>  <br>  Colic is a real possibility<br>  <br>  This wasn't typical with my two, go with your instincts - especially if you are concerned that this is out of character for her.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Try burbing longer, never wake to feed, lay baby across your lap while supporting her head, and pat her back softly to help loosen any trapped gas. Take a break, lay her in her crib so you dont over stress during these really fun times :(|`|AA12212403	If she is truly not usually like this, call the doctor.<br>  Maybe something is wrong.<br>  However, most babies cry like that.  I remember it well and slept very little.  Colic?<br>  I got one of those infant swings that worked so well.  My son had colic and he cried from about 4:00 pm - 11:00 pm each night.  Then, I got that swing and it helped both of us, best money I ever spent.  He would nod off in it long enough for me to make and eat dinner, at least.<br>  Also, if you are alone taking care of the baby, ask someone to come and help you.  If they hold the baby for even 10 - 15 minutes while you go out for a walk or cry in the shower, even, it will take the stress off you.<br>  Cyber hugs for you, sweetie.  I wish you were my next door neighbor so I could come over and bring you dinner and watch the baby for a little bit.  Things are that are a Godsend.<br>  Remember that this time in your child's life is fleeting, things will get better, I promise!|`|wPD3BGEHaa	Maybe she has colic, it's terribly painful, but only a doctor can say for sure.<br>  She might also be tired|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	delay wind  ,, burp baby more ...|`|VR5dGg4taa	possibly acid reflux? try laying her down...see if she keeps on crying..and then sit her back up again and if that makes her stop crying you might have her answer....and if that's the case..then don't eat any spicy foods (assuming you're breastfeeding) but if you're giving her formula that wouldn't make a difference...<br>  <br>  is she constipated/have diarrhea at all? <br>  <br>  maybe she is stressed out from too much interaction...everyone loves holding newborns and being around them but that could prove too much for her...maybe she wants peace and quiet??<br>  <br>  or colic...like everyone else said...and for that just hang in there...maybe enlist the help of friends and family who've been there...|`|ANcCxdEfaa	My 1st daughter used to do this to me when her mother left.  She'd cry for 3 hours straight but nothing was wrong with her.  Just make sure she's ok, (fed, changed, burped, comfortable) and let her be.<br>  <br>  I know it sounds cruel but leave her in her crib and just check on her every 15 minutes or so (keep her in ear shot).<br>  <br>  She got over it after a few weeks...<br>  <br>  This is all assuming that nothing medical is wrong with her.  If NO one can pacify her, see her doctor.|`|vtGlSJfCaa	give bike or some toys which make sound or put a tv show like pokemon or barney or hi 5 or any other kid shows and give her a warm bath and that should do it if not email wat happened after wat i told|`|inA6ZLeAaa	Does she have colic? What are you feeding her? It might be upsetting her stomach more so than helping her. Try laying her upside down on your legs and gently pushing her back up towards her shoulders this sometimes helps get rid of excess air on tummy. Also, try mylicon drops. Also, pat her on back as she is upside down. Change formula to soy also.|`|zIMoBfuvaa	try giving her a warm bath. when my son was colicy as a newborn, he would love warm baths and that was the only way i could calm him at times. she is most likely overly tired as well. once shes out of the bath i would try to rock her to sleep. hope this helps, good luck!|`|tIg3low2aa	Sounds like she is colicky and her tummy hurts! Take her to the pediatrician!|`|PaBdl94Xaa	you answered you own questions:<br>  SHE'S ONLY FOUR WEEKS OLD.<br>  [=|`|z6IekuwSaa	Ok learn from my mistake. She might be tired. Try laying her down with the lights off|`|CN44WsTpaa	Is she laying down when she cries? Try picking her up and rocking her briskly so that she'll feel the movement. Walk with her, bounce her up and down, go to a different room, give her to someone else, talk to her, etc.  She might just be tired, or bored, or simply fussy.  If it doesn't work then just let her cry a little bit (I know it's hard) and try again in a few minutes.  I learned with my daughter that she does not want to be down for a second.  She wants to always be in someones arms. I guess she just needs a lot of stimulation in order to keep herself busy.  If it continues then ask her pediatrician if it could be colic.|`|E3hL6dbyaa	Well, If Walking  Around with her and talking to her isn't working, <br>  then Check all the point of irritation.<br>  Think of things that irritate YOU. <br>  You Haven't Tried 'Everything" Till She Stops Crying.<br>  <br>  Consider This<br>  <br>  ? Is here close to tight or irritating areas of her skin<br>  (showing signs of rash or heat rash) typically in a warm home just a pamper is fine She was butt naked before she got here.<br>  <br>  ?What Have YOU changed in your scheduling (Her Schedule) or daily tasks<br>  <br>  ? Is she to hot  or and have a fever <br>  <br>  ?

My first had it and all joking aside, it really is horrible. Constant crying.....day & night. Usually the dr can tell you if it is or not thought. Maybe she has a earache of some sort or is just feeling under the weather|`|jpXavipoaa	Maybe your cute baby is tired. Try rocking her to sleep or sing her a song but dont get angry at her it will make her cry more and more!|`|5dX5JZVGaa	it's typical. it's fine.|`|Dl1LT6aFaa	Maybe you should try going to someone you know (mom,friend,etc).|`|ovAmbuo8aa	The answer is: ITS YOUR DAUGHTER, you dont be her mother...|`|KzR2hFl3aa	its colic 4 sho|`|50gZCTtxaa	go to the doctor, she might have ear problems

277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	yes you should take him to the dr.  white spots on a diaper rash are definately not normal.  have you tried powder?  just make sure it doesn't have cornstarch in this case just in case it's a yeast infection.  yeast actually feed on cornstarch.  but if i were you i would call the nurse on call, they don't charge for that.  and they will have a better idea of what to do than most people answering your question.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I liked Desitin - the creamy version.<br>  <br>  White spots could be a yeast infection - yes, infant boys can get those on their diaper area. Go see your doc to be sure!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Sounds like he has a yeast infection on his bottom (happens alot as we have yeast all over our bodies).  There are natural remedies or you can take him to the doctor and you'll get a script for an anti-fungal ointment.  <br>  <br>  Also, steer clear of using vaseline on his bottom.  All it will do is trap bacteria. And you don't need to use other creams either on a regular basis.  If you are changing him often you won't need to worry about his bottom being irritated. You don't have to change every hour.  Every 2-3 hours with urine and immediately after a bowel movement is sufficient. That's not to say he won't ever get irritated but for the most part they stay pretty clear.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	try out some different creams ( there are many out there) my sons rashes never went away with creams, only baby powered helped him.. also.. if he is pooing a lot (like diarrhea) you should just put him in the tub and rinse his butt.. that will help from getting a rash in the first place, from the constant wiping..  <br>  <br>  the white spots are a yeast infection, the doctor will prescribe a cream to put on it.|`|cTeVCTvOaa	keep a diaper off as much as possible, but be prepared to clean up a lot of messes!  Lol.  Try putting hydro-cortisone on him rather than zinc oxide.  It will help heal him.  WOrked with my daughter when  her diaper rash got so bad it blistered!  It should take 3-4 days of hydrocortisone and airing out.  Good luck!|`|smcWIZxPaa	it might be a yeast infection. my son had one (i didn't even know that boys could get them).  if it isn't i would try desitin creamy or boudreaux's butt paste. both of them work like a charm|`|V6slDthdaa	Sounds like a yeast infection. Boys can get them too. See his doctor, he'll prescribe something.|`|d9c7a6eeef7a5dceaaa85829a8cdaed7aa	I use A&D ointment, and make sure you change the baby at least every hour to make sure his butt is dry. He will be ok, I know it is nerve wrecking with this being his first time and all, but if you feel too bad call the nurse line at his pediatricians office.
BzCYQlcuaa	well you don't get a protruding tummy until you are 3/4 months. and you tummy doesn't get hard that quick either, but having sex you could be pregnant if you missed your period. since this month it was lighter that could be a sign of being pregnant called spotting. i would just get a test and that is the only way you would know for sure. i am 9 weeks and i am just starting to pee allot. but i heard that sometime that symptom can happen sooner. the first sign i got was being sleepy all the time, i sleep 15 hours a day, and puking in the am and all day nausea! that's how i new i was pregnant but its different for everyone!<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  god bless.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	I would get a HPT the bleeding may have been implantation bleeding and not your period|`|w1jyHMRbaa	sounds like you could be! take a test to be sure...good luck! hope you get the result you want!|`|p8HOUxNVaa	it sounds possible take a test to put your mind at ease, it could just be bloating|`|RcchpBX5aa	I will give you a tip and it's really easy...............TAKE A TEST!<br>  (@ home test or the Dr.)|`|cuanHkwlaa	did you have sex? maybe you should go to the store and get a home test.
2JTBPhuuaa	This is common. Take either Zantac or Prilosec once a day. Then use Tums (chewable calcium tabs) for breakthrough heartburn. All these meds are OTC and fine to take while pregnant.|`|Hi5h9739aa	yes it is.  My first pregnancy I had to walk around with a bottle of tums and a bag of saltine crackers.  (for the first trimester)|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i had heart burn way early not that early but like 5 weeks - 10-weeks
cSm1zod4aa	its possible, my clothes started to get tighter at 9 weeks and I was showing by 13 weeks. this is my first pregnancy. all depends on your body, everyone is different. good luck!|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	It is only bloating. Until 12-14 weeks, your uterus is still tucked behind your pelvic bone and is unable to be felt or to push out your stomach to make it show. Bloating in early pregnancy is very normal. At 7 weeks, your uterus is only a bit bigger than your fist and your baby is only about 1/2 an inch long. About the size of a blueberry. But it won't take long for you to start showing :)|`|WPI0Z47saa	At that point in pregnancy it is just water weight and bloating. It isn't the baby which is only the size of a grain of rice at that points.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	At about 13 weeks is when I had to start using a rubberband on some of my pants but not all.|`|NV5CQU8Taa	You may be bloating already, but that is all.
f339a9f3cf7d571157484d675d6af3b7aa	Sound real good together.

Maybe just James Jarrell Williams though.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	I like it all:)|`|LmlIzdwsaa	i like it a lot !|`|ufnSqRiqaa	I like it.  Are you debating any part of the name?

l4mMBe5Aaa	Our daughter had to have an xray at 1 week old.  I don't think they would do it if there was any proof of it doing any harm.|`|V6slDthdaa	It's only dangerous if there is constant exposure. A few here and there won't do any harm.|`|4yUUUkAsaa	My 2 1/2 year old has serious medical problems and has had tons of xrays.  So far it dosen't seem to have affected him at all.|`|8a949c7984d501f70f4b690183ae5920aa	My son was six months when he started having x-rays and ct-scans for cancer.  hes five now and has endured numerous radiation tests.  He is doing fine!
MOsStEbqaa	You need to make sure you are having sex on the right days. You should check on the days that you are ovulating and have sex on those days.|`|S5n5Za78aa	you should look into the book (taking charge of your fertility) you can prob get it from library and start charting your temps  on fertilityfriend.com but the book will teach you everything as far as pinpointing ovulation<br>  or you can wait for ovulation which can occur anywhere from 10-24 days after the first day of you period (fertile period ) its different for everyone and start using ovulation predictor kits till you get a positive between the days i just mentioned and go from there  but you have to make sure whatever you do your having sex on the RIGHT days it can get tricky!! good luck|`|dMv8X2nIaa	Get some Opks at the store. ( Ovulation Predicter Kit). Dont use first morning urine..i would take the test sometime after 12 noon...start on day 10 , counting your 1st day of period as day 1. Take one test a day , starting day 10 and at the same time everyday. When you get a +, have sex that night and every other night ( every other since his count is low) Once you get a + you can stop using the tests...count the day after your + as 1dpo(days past ovulation) you can try n take a pg test at 10dpo but def.tly take one at 14dpo. Good luck and babydust!!! Remember the closer you are to AF coming, the less likely your fertile and will become Pg. Try also a sperm friendly lubricant..helps his swimmers..and remember sperm can live inside of women from 3-5 days..
wl7tlYOYaa	Am on the same boat...we dont have sex very often anymore and my sex drive is definately up...have you tried asking him straight why he wont when its not going to hurt the baby? if he really thinks it will then take him to one of your docs appointments and have the doc speak to him about it not doing anything to the baby its actually good because when you orgasm you work the muscles in your uterus and your baby gets the happy feeling you get. Personally I just violate him in the middle of the night that usually works lol|`|2ynhPyh8aa	He might be creeped out since the baby would technically be there and all. Or, he might just be very very nervous, many men are. You could get him drunk lol|`|NV5CQU8Taa	He is way to worried about the baby. It is natural. Some man can't get into it if they think they might cause some major harm.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	its normal for your partner to be like. its just the fear of huring baby inside. its hard for them - Like a father would be afraid of anything happening to their babies.<br>  <br>  Its safe when the doctor gives the go ahead. You could try take him and have the doctor say its safe. but if he still feels uncomfortable, then he wont.<br>  <br>  Speak to him about it again - clearly and say how you feel , so he knows. <br>  <br>  god bless x
Lr6uYg8paa	okay I am 24 weeks pregnant. I never had the sore boobs and not everyone gets that and as for morning sickness not everyone gets that either! Your doctor should try till he finds a heart beat I know mine dont give up till he does! Next time you go to the doctor and they tell you the baby is moving to much to get one ask for an ultrasound you can get one through that! But if you dont have any problems and they say the baby is okay trust them! hope that helps!|`|FTcx2lBHaa	Every ones pregnancy is different. If your not getting your period most likely your pregnant. If you went to the doctor and took a pregnancy test and it says your pregnant most likely your pregnant. If you are and your not having any symptoms, be happy because i had morning sickness, ligament pain, the works. So be glad your not experiencing any of that. Good luck.|`|ied3Ww49aa	Every pregnancy is different...completely different! W/ my first pregnancy...I felt pregnant by my 2 month! i was in maternity clothes by 4 months...swollen breasts...moody...tired all the time...hungry all the time. I am currently 32 weeks pregnant with my second child and feel amazing! I have only gained 11 lbs and havent even needed to be in maternity clothes! I have energy..no mood swings..no cravings. This pregnancy is completely different. Just sit back and enjoy this experience!!<br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!|`|caf50252033092f023c9a8b6fa7c0c34aa	I am 13 weeks and have nothing!!! I would not know I was pregnant if not for the missed period and me going to the doc for a test. Don't worry about it. if the test is pos...you are most likely one of the VERY lucky ones (like me) who have no symptoms. Be happy, if you are so very very worried demand an ultrasound...you are about 1-2 weeks away from getting a gender confirmation ultrasound.|`|MTeN6WpPaa	I had no symptons whatsoever but the missing period. My boobs never hurt like people say and I didnt really have any morning sicknes and when I went to the Dr. the first time it took her forever to get a good heartbeat because he moved so much, but when they get bigger they will def. not have a hard time finding it. Im 8months preg now and def. feel pregnant. DONT WORRY ITS COMING HAHA.<br>  Hope this helps. GOODLUCK AND CONGRATS!|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	Yes, everyones pregnancy is different. On my 3rd child, I didnt feel anything at all at your point of pregnancy. But on my 2nd child, I was vomiting all the time!!! Take it easy and rest...your baby will be fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|ks8KlDDgaa	That's perfectly normal. <br>   <br>  Some people go all three trimesters without feeling a thing. Women have given birth before knowing they were pregnant.<br>  <br>  Chances are, your baby will be fine.|`|XukXVsJvaa	Its ok. I didnt have any signs of pregnancy with my second.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	this is normal darling.<br>  Symptoms do ware off usually average after week 14. <br>  So keep strong - Everything is fine :)<br>  <br>  its good that baby is moving around.<br>  <br>  God bless x all the best x|`|BzCYQlcuaa	relax hun! i am 9 weeks and my morning sickness and finally stopping! it was sooo bad when i was 5-7 week and know its almost gone. my only symptom now is being sleepy. all i do is sleep like 15 hours a day. my boobs not hurt and never have! they got a little bigger but they don't hurt. and i am not showing either. you may just be one of the lucky ones. if you stress you could upset the baby. just relax and you will be fine. your baby is just being good to his/her mommy! god bless.. xoxox|`|tcHkn0VIaa	i am 16 weeks and i do not really feel pregnant yet either my breasts did hurt early on and i had slight nausea for weeks 6-8. but i have heard the heartbeat with the ultrasound, the main thing is the dr is not concerned and that is a good sign. I would not worry unless you start bleeding or cramping. we should start to feel our babies soon. within the next few weeks and i can not wait for that constant reminder that i am pregnant and that everything is ok. Good luck to you!|`|H2IhRXIIaa	Dont talk to soon...I was feeling the same exact way! Except for my breast, they killed me. But now im 24 weeks and nothing fits, my belly blew up over night! And I just feel so pregnant. Cant fit my jeans..everything I bought when i was 3 months are too small. Just happened over night. my back hurts now. Ect....So just dont question it too soon.<br>  <br>  But good for you and good luck!!!<br>  <br>  Oh and yes my baby moves sooo much its hard to get a heart beat. They have to fight with her for a minute and follow her around. Its the sound waves she hates them so much!|`|yKS2UI87aa	Don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Be glad you don't have morning sickness. Alot of women are probably jealous of you. My son did not like that machine either and would move as far away as possible. My Dr. had perseverance and found it. If the Dr. thought there was something wrong they would've told you. Congrat's|`|MJI8murVaa	don't worry too much. my first baby was the same situation. it's great that your baby is giving you a easy pregnancy. don't worry too much it's very normal. maybe its a boy i think
fMilDRgLaa	Like a few others have mentioned first thing in the morning is when you produce the most milk. I guess a question you need to answer is when your baby is at the babysitter how many bottles of pumped milk will you need?  Are we talking a couple or 6-8 bottles? Depends how long you will be away.  <br>  <br>  At first, you could pump right after feedings or every other feeding. Yes, at first you will not get much but this is what is told to women who want to increase their milk supply and store it.  It signals the brain to produce more milk with in a few days.  So you could feed off of just one breast and pump the other. <br>  <br>  If you can get the amount of bottles you need originally, I think you will find that what you pump while away from the baby will be good enough for the next time the baby is at the sitters.  It is good to have a few bags or bottles in the freezer for back up though.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	I would wait a bit after feeding.  Anytime I've ever tried to pump right after feeding I get almost nothing because the baby has done her job and emptied the breasts.  But if you wait a bit then you give your body time to start making more.  I would pump a couple of times a day and see what you get.  Then you can adjust how many times you pump based on what your little one needs.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Try pumping the unused breast during the first feed in the morning and just before you go to bed (or the longest period after you baby goes to sleep and before you normally go to sleep).<br>  <br>  That should get you the most milk with the least effort and time.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Best time to pump is in the morning -you have the most milkk then.  Especially if baby fills up on one side in the morning,  it is a great way to get the most milk in the least time. Otherwise, it is good to wait about an hour after a feeding. <br>  <br>  How many times a day depends on how much you get per session and how much baby drinks per bottle.  At first you will probably only get a few ounces, but after that you will probably get at least 3-5 oz a session. I give one bottle a day, and I typically pump once a day (during the missed feeding) and also a second time in the morning on 2-3 days of the week. It is nice to pump some extra to freeze for emergencies or when you don't have time for as much pumping as normal. I would anticipate that by pumping once a day for around 20 minutes you would easily get enough for 2 bottles a week.|`|703c83fe1a687f02e99bde09a9966ecfaa	I would pump right after a feeding.  This is what I used to do, and I felt like the stimulation from the baby kept the rest of the milk coming after she was finished.  I didn't get a whole lot, but doing this will help build up your supply as well.  Also, sometimes my daughter would decide she wasn't hungry and I pumped then.  I was concerned that after I pumped, she'd be hungry and I'd have no milk for her, but the lactation consultant at the hospital where I work said that wasn't the case.  Our breasts are constantly making milk and it doesn't take that long for them to be ready for a feeding again.|`|xRZ1PRZwaa	I think this will be different for most women, but for me, I only pumped when I thought I might need some back-up milk for my little guy (like before I had to go out). I only got milk when I'd nurse him on one side and pump on the other (me and the pump never really got along very well!).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps a bit!|`|z6IekuwSaa	Def in the morning, you make the most milk between 1am and 5am. If your baby doesn't nurse during those times pump both breasts then. You only have to have 2 hours till they fill up again and your baby will have plenty. Also, as others said just pump the one the baby isn't on. Pumping right after a feeding will increase your milk supply, which can be great. But if you increase it and then aren't emptying them you could get plugged ducts. They aren't bad just a little sore till you massage them out while pumping or nursing|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	it depends on you.  if you're just trying to pump enough for the sitter, i would do it right after baby goes to bed, less chance of baby wanting to eat right about then.  though, you do tend to produce more right away in the morning, so either i guess.
FkGh0LuWaa	Set up different tables in the playroom to keep them busy.  You can have coloring books and crayons, play dough, books for all ages, dress up section for the younger kids (old clothing, shoes, etc), musical Instruments or make your own, snacks that they can help make, and play a game that involves all the kids like Simon Says.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	to me thats to many kids of a young age , for one person to look after , and your only 16 ,,,|`|wE5JMeesaa	I'm sure that you're a great, responsible person--but there's know way I would trust a 16 year old alone with 8 children.

26tCY1z2aa	I slept with my guy friends all the time when I was younger. Now let me explain before you think I was a weirdo, if I were staying at a friends house or the other way round and if my friends didnt want to sleep on the floor I would share my bed, we would just sleep feet to head not head to head, I am very secure with my sexuality and so were my friends so it was never a big deal, like people above has stated it's only a big deal if you make it a big deal.|`|3G1KwlOdaa	No.  A girl & boy cousin maybe.

You should be able to see him well. Good Luck.|`|wLhcRPUOaa	i had one at 27 weeks and he didnt look like an alien at all.

They looked amazing.You could already see features clearly.Then a few weeks later we could not get any pictures. It just depends.Some places will let you come back if you don't get a good picture.I personally think that is a good time. The last time our girls looked like aliens was at 20 weeks.|`|xy5UNiELaa	I've always heard between 28 and 32 weeks gets the best pics.  For my first, we had a 4-d at 35 weeks and he was so cute.

88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	Wow. That age is so tough. First of all if he is constipated he will get sick easier. The things that cause my kiddos to have times like this were a combination of things.<br>  Are all the other kiddos sick at his child care?  Has your sitter had training in sanitizing and strategies to prevent germs from passing back and forth?<br>  Has he been introduced to new foods or animals that he's allergic to? Allergies can lower their immunity.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they get one thing after another. Hope this is helpful and hope he feels better soon. :)|`|1fizRjZnaa	Give him Gator aid or some pop cycles made from pedoite, let him eat dry cereal cheriose or something wih fiber to move his bowels he is keeping the infection in and his body keeps recycleing it.

R0EsQapRaa	Is he around other family members much?  I know alot of moms can't imagine leaving their baby with someone else, but I think in the long run it really helps them develop socially and emotionally.<br>  <br>  If you have family members who live nearby try leaving him with them while you run a short errand.  <br>  <br>  My baby is a little over 8 months and stays with her grandparents all the time (even over night) and she is so used to all of us that we may be able to skip the whole "seperation anxiety" phase.<br>  <br>  You should NOT cancel your classes.  If you continue to not leave his side it will only get worse.  Plus you NEED "me" time!|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	try giving him a sort of distraction before you go.  have daddy play with him while you are still there and don't say bye to him after they start, but say it before.  if you can do it somewhere away from the door you will be leaving from.  and just go before he thinks to look for you, it may or may not help, but it is an idea.|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	Don't cancel your classes. Once your son gets used to spending the extra time with daddy, he'll get used to it and probably get along better with him. All you can do is give them bonding time. He'll probably fight it at first, but he'll adapt.|`|r4E2zXL8aa	I hate "do your own thinking's" answers. Every one of them!|`|gvdoMC1baa	Don't cancel the classes. Your son will be fine without you. It'll be good for both  of you to have a little time apart.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Get dad more involved in small ways. Let dad do dinner, change diapers, read, bath... small things that will make him more comfortable with dad. My son was the same way for a long time, it was awful. It took about a month of dad taking over small daily tasks for our son to be comfortable staying home alone with dad. He still can't watch me leave, dad takes him to the bedroom while I walk out the door. They do fine together though.<br>  <br>  Take your class. He is fine home with dad and will get over it if dad gets more involved on a regular basis.|`|DDIBEvUTaa	i need help too.  my husband & son are both miserable the 2 days a month that I work!|`|NroZQN5vaa	The best (and easiest) thing to try is for you to sleep with one of his blankets and when you leave, have Daddy snuggle Jacob with the blanket. That way, Jacob can smell you and should calm down. If that doesn't work, you can record you singing to him and have Daddy play that and snuggle Jacob with the blanket and that should help. I think that you should still take the class. I'm sure your husband can handle it for a little while.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	This is the first fun outing you've had since the baby was born...go for it!  Jacob will get used to daddy's care, but only if he is allowed to get used to it.  Changing diapers, feeding, bathing, playing on the floor with him...these are great bonding times for baby and daddy.  <br>  <br>  Have fun!!|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	it will pass . mine girl loves her daddy no when he gets home and wants him more she 21 months . your boy will be ok But will you ? I never could handly it lol|`|7kosr9mcaa	I would still go to your cooking classes. Jacob will get used to the new routine of having some time with daddy. Daddy just has to except how Jacob acts because this is what babies do, ofcourse he doesn't know any better. My son will me 1 yr on march 9th and he is like this too. Infact sometimes he is so bad that when Daddy tries to feed him he screams and gag on the food as if it were gross, but then i try to feed him the same thing and he's opening his mouth so fast i can't shovel it in fast enough for him. It's just a phase, it'll pass.

It was hidden in my parent's closet and I watched it over and over again.<br>  <br>  My husband was 9 when he saw his first nudie magazine. His older brothers showed it to him.<br>  <br>  You can't keep a kid from looking at sexual things. If there's no porn in the house, a kid will gawk over fully-dressed women in magazines with a bit of cleavage peeping out. Kids will stare at their teachers boobs. There's no stopping that. I think the normal age for this sort of thing to start is anywhere between 10 and 12. It's usually when kids, especially boys, start to sit up and notice the opposite sex.|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	Children don't 'start' watching porn like they 'start' walking or speaking, or thinking.<br>  <br>  Not all children do it, not all teens do it, not all adults do it either.<br>  <br>  You should prevent your child watching porn if they're as young as 9, it really is not a good example of human form, generally showing only 'perfection' and not anything they may encounter in real life.<br>  <br>  It can lead to bad self-image in young children, and I personally don't see it's point.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I have never looked at porn.

My husband and I were together for 8 years before we got pregnant and hardly ever fought. Once the baby came it got stressful sometimes and we fought some. Things definitely were harder for the first year. He had a great job and I was able to be a stay at home mom but I got depressed. He got depressed. But that was then. My son is 3 now and things are great and I couldn't be happier. We are expecting our second in June and we are very excited. It is just a little overwhelming in the beginning with a first baby. Your life becomes all about the baby and you don't always have the same time for each other. It does get better though and is definitely worth it in the long run.|`|FRjriJNuaa	first things first. dont think know. are you pregnant or not. if you are expect things to change. i was 20 when i had my daughter. im 22 now. if you spend a lot of time together and at home with out going out you should try getting out more. after the baby comes youll want to get away sometimes. my daughter is too and once a month my mom watches her so my husband and i can get out and have some us time.
jaP0TANdaa	I've heard that spotting during your luteal phase can indicate a progesterone problem... which will cause problems with TTC as there may not be enough progesterone in your system to support a pregnancy. Don't get too worried yet though, there's no telling for sure. Just keep tracking your cycles (and your days of spotting) and find a new doctor that will help you... it's ridiculous that your doctor won't even humor you and try to give you an explantation for why you're spotting. How long does the spotting last? If it's only a few days right around ovulation, it may be normal. A lot of women will spot around ovulation (some a few days before, some the day of, some a few days after) and this doesn't indicate any kind of problem.|`|oiJITSNZaa	One thing that I tell my patients is the first step is to make sure that you are ovulating. Just because you have a period doesn't necessarily mean that you are ovulating every month. So this is where I would start. Try an ovulation test. I guess my first thought was that since you have irregular periods, often that is a sign of not ovulating. Good Luck!|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	I would start to chat my body temp every morning and also do ovulation strips..<br>  Hope u get a + soon x|`|vigFmfLmaa	First, you should find a new doctor.  Everyone deserves a good medical partner.  Besides you're paying him so he should really work for you, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  I would talk to a new doctor about this issue.  Since it's regularly occuring it may be normal for you and nothing to worry over.  It could possibly indicate some problem though if you are also having trouble conceiving.  27-32 days isn't terribly irregular.  Very few women have 28 day clockwork cycles.  Mine sometimes go as long as 3 months.  I would say if you're having a period about every month you are most likely ovulating.

All I can say is that you have to do what is best for you and your family.  If having an abortion is the best for all involved, then do it.  It will be hard, and heart and gut wrenching - there is no doubt.<br>  <br>  Just remember to reach out for your partner.  You need to be supported emotionally and physically.  <br>  <br>  Having said that, I had 3 children in 2 1/2 years.  It was very hard at first - extremely hard.  I could not believe I fell pg for a 3rd time without even trying - lol.  My youngest is now 4, and life is very easy.  I am very pleased I came through the hard years of 3 babies all at once - because that is what you will have if you decide to keep the baby.  MY 'babies' are now 6, 5 and 4.  You do get through it.<br>  <br>  If you have a strong family, the right decision will come - and you will get through it - whatever that may be.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AXEqOEloaa	Well if you know anything about the pull out method you know it is not a sure thing. No form of BC is but why in the would would you even take the chance if you know you don't want anymore kids PERIOD? If you are not pregnant you need to get on BC like now or get yourself or your man fixed. I hope everything works out for the best, good luck.|`|0upnZ6hSaa	How could you do that after going through the beautiful experience of pregnancy.  There is a little life inside of you.  If you didn't want this baby--you should have been adult enough to prevent it.  I hope your results are negative for your sake but more importantly that innocent little life that may be.|`|5MKmKa27aa	I think u shouldn't to it, u have a lil live... this is a hard decision but put in a balance wat will cost u more in the long run your emotions or economically.. if u abort u will Always b thinking about it.. Yea a baby now will b allot of work today but u don't know if tomorrow he can b a Doc. a teacher or something like that<br>  I sure hope u make the right decision<br>  I'll pay for u and hope God guide ur decision...|`|R1RGYpneaa	never use the pull out method it never works pre *** gets u pregnent more effectively then anything else u need to discuss this with him i dont believe in abortion but its ur choice goodluck|`|AA10254927	Wish you'd used precaution!<br>  But now that you r in it... well its truly how you view it!<br>  7wks old is really young!!! Do you think it will be fair for you to be carrying another while the other 2still need you sooo much?<br>  But then again, if you are anti-abortion, you dont have much choice!<br>  <br>  Having 2kids is a good family size. And if you do go with abortion, you really have nuthing to regret about... having a beautifully complete family already!<br>  <br>  GoodLuck sweetheart!|`|F9pAWBG9aa	sounds like you have a lot on your plate. i know it would break you but honestly if i were you i would keep the baby. if you didn't want anymore why wouldn't you get your tubes tied or some form of birthcontrol? i know there will be a lot of haters to your post but you don't sound like you truly want that abortion. call some clinics and talk to some doctors maybe find a support group to go and chat with. sometimes they can be your best help. you don't want to regret your decision no matter what it is.|`|l2kQZQkwaa	oh girlfriend, really???? you said that your youngest is only 7 weeks old why are you even having sex yet? Don't you know that you're body isn't ready to handle it yet and it's still healing.  Aside from the fact that the pull out method is just the guys way of not having to wear a rubber.<br>  <br>  that aside, i know exactly where you are coming from.  I had my daughter then my son and i was happy.  unfortunately, the pill stopped working and i got pregnant again.  I decided that i really didn't want another kid and i REALLY didn't want to do the whole pregancy & labor thing so my husband and I decided that an abortion would be the best answer.  I've also made the decision to get my tubes done so I wouldn't be forced into the same situation again.  Because of your age, you should talke to your OB/GYN about maybe a IUC, no hormones and is very effective.<br>  <br>  Do i regret it, sometimes, but then I also think about what it would have cost my family economically.  If i had kept the baby, the effect would have been devistating.  As is stands, we are still able to afford restaurants (now that both kids are ordering off of the regular menu its kinda pricey) and go on vacations or to the zoo without seriously damaging our budget.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, its a hard decision, but regardless of what anyone answers here, it is still your choice.  Don't make the pro-lifers make you feel like $hit.|`|WfHl3dNGaa	my personal opinion would be to have this baby, your indecisiveness is called " a conscious" <br>  I have two children and had an abortion . Let me tell you, that is something that you will never forget . I sometimes wonder how i will be punished in my after life but just pray to god for forgiveness. I am will the others that say pulling out is not protection and you should really educate yourself on sex education.<br>  You say you are financially sound, well 1 more should not make that bit of a difference  and take the advice of others and get into a support group. You are still very young and having to grow up too quick!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I don't think you should have an abortion but it seems you have your mind made up.  Its pretty sad that you feel this way now but didn't have this same state of mind when you use the "pull-out" method.  If you are not pregnant than please be more responsible in preventing pregnancy...abortion shouldn't be your form of birth control.  With that being said...you have made it clear you didn't want your second daughter and its unfortunate that you may be pregnant with another child thats unwanted.  *sigh*  You sound like you and your husband have really established yourselves so once you get past this you should focus on some type of prevention.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Oh that sounds like a very hard decision for you. =( <br>  <br>  I can understand your situation a little. I get very sick when I'm pregnant and decided to have an abortion after having my first daughter, because I didn't think I could cope with being unable to care for my daughter as best as I could. I was against abortion on a personal level, despite being pro-choice, but eventually decided it would be a strain on my daughters life as well for that year and had an abortion. <br>  <br>  It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. I was under anesthetic, and aware of very little. I don't have regrets now, because I know I did what was best for my family at the time, and I didn't feel it was really an actual life at the time. <br>  <br>  I don't know if you're religious but if it helps, most religions don't consider an embryo as a "life" until the start of the second trimester, and even the Catholic faith has believed this during certain periods, depending on the pope. <br>  <br>  Do what's right for you. If you know you wouldn't be able to give it up for adoption after birth, you obviously know yourself very well.<br>  <br>  Wishing you all the best.|`|XGQpERs3aa	Please pray that the test comes out negative.  I really can't give you advice about an abortion. Because it is your choice.   Just try to weigh the pros and cons, how it will affect you if you do it or not.  Just think about your family and your situation and try to make the best decision possible....   I really hope the results come out negative so that you won't have to make that decision.  Good Luck|`|sxZk6njLaa	For me, if I knew I didn't want the baby I would get an abortion.<br>  <br>  You are looking at it practically (you don't have the money) and emotionally (you don't want the baby). But only you can decide what's right.<br>  <br>  The decision lies with you. If you decide to have an abortion it absolutely does not make you a bad person.|`|AA11661793	Should of used some protection, pull out method isn't protection|`|PfIywLLyaa	Gosh, pregnant only 7weeks after delivery???<br>  <br>  I have always tried to make do with what I have got. I would sacrifice everything for my children, born or unborn. If I was pregnant and I knew things would be very difficult for us, I would still have the baby and keep it. I would make the best of the situation and do what I could to improve it. Back in the days of our grandparents and great grandparents, they would have 6, 8, even 10 or more children, live in a small home with one income and make it work. Nothing is impossible.<br>  <br>  Good luck....

What about your father, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, godparents, etc.? You can tell them what is going on and see if they would mind taking you in or even try and talk with your mom..It is not a healthy environment for you to grow up in..I am sorry this is happening to you and I am at a lost for words cuz this has never happened to me.. But i can say that you should save up the lil money you get and do what you need to do with it...But you should also talk to a school guidance counseor about this and they will definately help you out...

It's exactly how my mother treats me and my brother. Your school guide is there to help you, and not to judge.

h9Mq5NwMaa	I am so sorry! i know what you mean. well you could try saving up money for piano lessons and really work hard to prove your self. if you do very well then she will maybe let you do more things. i play piano, and let me tell you, its not easy, but i love it. you should do it! do u have a piano at home? just help your mom out a lot and be very friendly, and maybe she will change her mind, if your already like that, i am very sorry.|`|bQisGgSsaa	That reminds me of Matilda.

Do you realize how expensive they are? It isn't just like oh here you can have this. They are thousands of dollars not 600 dollars that's nothing compared to pianos. You are almost 18 start acting more independent. You act like a little girl when you do this and hate to break it to you, but you aren't a little girl anymore. Get a job if you don't have one and show you are responsible. Earn some money and ask her if she wants to go out to lunch alone with you or pedicure, but offer to pay. You aren't a child anymore.
PFJ7ZbVZaa	Honestly, I know you don't want to go to the ER and then be sent back home, but I would at least call the ER and see what they tell you to do.  And do what they say.  Especially since you were 3 cm and 75% effaced at your last appointment.  Good luck momma!|`|d0fLx0LPaa	Generally hospitals won't do anything until the contractions are closer together. Based on what you've put they will probably send you home but because you're past term they may not. My contractions were about 4 minutes apart and they almost sent me home. As it was I didn't deliver for about 9 hours once I was at the hospital. Hope this helps.|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	It's always better to get a medical opinion from your doctor/hospital than to do nothing and have a problem later.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	I have three children and trust me you will know when you need to go to the DR!  <br>  <br>  You are almost there!  First labors can last forever!<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations!|`|V8GrFx0jaa	I think at this point you are better off staying home. 4 or 5 an hour isn't much. It does sound like you are in labor, so it's  up to you. Decide if you'd rather be in your home, or at the hospital...maybe for many hours before things progress. I suppose the hospital might be able to give you something for the nausea, but they're not going to give you much of anything else at this point.|`|cfdooGylaa	4 or 5 every hour is not at a lot at all. And you said they are irregular. It doesn't sound like you are in labor but it does sound like labor is near. Just keep an eye on them frequently and once you notice a pattern then go to the hospital. <br>  <br>  If you like you can always go to the hospital to get checked out though. Its embarassing to get sent home but at least you'd know the answer.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	if you are really in doubt go to the hospital and walk around and keep demanding to be seen. My sister in law kept being sent home because he contractions were irregular and she ended up having the baby on the recliner at home with an EMT from 911... I am not saying the hospital is wrong for sending you home... it might be hours before anything happens... or weeks for that matter. But if you feel more comfortable walking around the hospital by all means do it! My SIL was lucky that he baby was fine and there were no complications... <br>  <br>  Least let them check to see if you have dilated more. "true" contractions dilate the cervix... if you are 4-5 cm they will probably keep you because that is considered active labor GL and congrats!|`|Coc593Ikaa	You have not met the 511 rule yet, so the doctors will likely send you back home.<br>  <br>  511 rule: Contractions are 5 minutes apart, last for 1 minute and have been this way for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  You sound like you are in early labor. This can go on for many hours! You should call your doctor and tell them that you think that you are in early labor so that they know.|`|d93b1ccb720432932a26b34be145f5ceaa	first contact hospital so there ready for when u do come in <br>  then run the shower or bath and try letting the warm water sooth ur pains if u want to try hurring maybe pace around but as soon as u are to uncomfortable at home go straight to hospital to be checked<br>  my contractions with my son were never regular so they told me not to worry bout it and then when i went in and demanded they check they were shocked because i was so far into labour they hardly had time to prepare which wasnt good cos he was 8 weeks early. so anyways irregular or not still go|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I think I would go ahead and go to the ER, better be safe. If they send you home, oh well, but I kinda don't think they will. Good luck.|`|HoonZJMgaa	Walk even though its painful try as much as you can for a little while. This will bring on the contractions. If its truly impossible to walk, you will have to just continue to time the contractions and wait it out. But I will tell you this, when you have a situation like yours where you have started to dilate, you can be dilated even more by now and just not know it. It happened to me and I just made it to the hospital 20 mins my daughter was born! So be careful. If you don't mind the back and forth too much, just go back to be safe. Eventually they will get tired of you and just keep you there.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	They would send you home. Wait until your contractions are 2-3 min apart and lasting 1 min or so. As long as you don't have a history of very quick labor you can wait and labor at home. It just sounds like your in a very early labor that can very well quit at anytime and you could go for another week or two have sporadic contractions like you are. Try having sex if you can to help get things going.|`|04fd2039534f9759f9ec4ae1101ff131aa	Call the hospital and ask to speak to maternity or call your doctor if he's on call, they'll give you your opinion, I went in on Saturday after talking to them and they checked me and I was there for a few hours, they ran some tests and sent me home. There is nothing wrong with getting checked just to make sure.|`|MXXOICquaa	it sounds to me like they would send you home since your contractions arent that close together but i would call labor and delivery and see what they say and just simply explain you dont want to come in and get sent home although i do know that they just may want you to come in just to be sure but if it was me i would rather be safe than sorry and i would go|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Well at this point you are considered full term.  You will want to go to the hospital when you are 5 minutes apart, last one minute, and it has been going on for at least an hour.  <br>  <br>  Unless:  Call the doctor if<br>  <br>  You vomit<br>  or <br>  your water breaks|`|8PkEkTcZaa	go in for a checkup don't worry if you will get sent home you are just making sure your unborn child is healthy and okay you do not want something wrong so go and make sure girl|`|tcHkn0VIaa	once your contractions are regular you should go but as long as they are irregular it may be false labor even though it is intense. try breathing exercises to regulate your body and see if you cant get some regularity to the contractions. good luck mama|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	just wait. until your cramps become about 5 minutes apart then thats when its for sure you will get admitted to the hospital. just wait for your next doctors appointment
Tr7kIQPkaa	My son had this same problem around the same time as yours. His dr said that it was chapped skin from all the drooling he had started. Have you noticed a ton of drooling as well? <br>  <br>  I started using a cream called "Boudreaux's Baby Kisses". It looks like a tub of lip-balm and it says on it "soothes and helps heal dry, chapped lips and cheeks". It works great; the redness cleared up in a day or two. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!<br>  Good Luck!!|`|7bdhpvc9aa	He isn't too old for heat rash. His skin is still sensitive at this age.

427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	I think it's great.  I have 3 kids (ages 5, 4, and 18 months), and we try to include them in what we're doing as much as possible.  Of course, you have to be safe and age-appropriate with what you do, and it sounds like you are.  I'm sure there are people who aren't as careful as you, so it does make sense that people are warning you, just in case.<br>  <br>  A few other ideas that your daughter might enjoy (if your'e not doing these already)...<br>  <br>  -- Put her in her high chair with a small cup of water (or Cheerios, etc.), an empty cup, a spoon, or whatever other small utensils you can think of.  Let her stir and pour and splash and nibble while you do the same.  :-)<br>  <br>  -- Have her cook in a pretend kitchen while you cook on the real stove.<br>  <br>  -- Let her smell, taste, and/or touch all the ingredients you add to something.  <br>  <br>  My 18-month-old son loves to stand at the sink and "wash" his hands.  We turn the faucet on to a trickle, and he'll do that for several minutes while I take care of other things in the kitchen.  He also likes to help stir things and pour ingredients into a bowl.  If something is cooking on the stove, my husband or I will hold him so that he can see what's cooking and watch the steam.  We always tell him that the stove is hot and that he shouldn't touch it.  We have even held his hand in the steam (high above the pot, of course) so that he can feel the heat and understand.  I let him push the Start button on the microwave, and he helps to load and unload the unbreakables from the dishwasher.<br>  <br>  There are so many ways to get your little ones involved early, and it sounds like you're doing a great job.|`|FkGh0LuWaa	Don't listen to your friend.  My kids have been helping me in the kitchen sense they have been able to walk.  Cooking teaches kids a lot and it is great mommy and daughter or son time.  Also go to familyfun.com and go to their recipe section.  They have a lot of great kid friendly recipes that I am sure you two will enjoy doing together.  Keep up the cooking and don't listen to what anyone else says.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	kids who help with the prep of food are less likely to be fussy eaters <br>  as long as shes no were near hot things .. dont want her to get burnt !<br>  i Spose ur also teaching her safety too .. oven is hot .. knives are sharp ...  i think its great|`|dDVAUA9saa	Absolutely not!  My daughter started helping me do stuff in the kitchen around that age, maybe a bit older.  She's 23 months and LOVES helping me bake.  At Christmas, she helped me make cookies, and now she likes helping me make muffins.  It's a great learning experience and gives them something different to do.  Often, my daughter has more fun being the "taste tester" and licking the bowl!!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Just today Emma helped me "cook" by mashing the stuffing into a crumb topping with a rolling pin.....she thought it was great and then wouldn't give me the rolling pin back and proceeded to roll it on the floor like a car....  : )|`|1fizRjZnaa	Safety first NEVER turn your back for 1 second But injoy why she is little U will be suprised what they learn and remember  sucha young age|`|n0uwYsGIaa	the only thing i say u should do is hold her and allow her to sprinkle things in and drop things in while your holding her but nuthing else unless shes in your arms not on a chair|`|123IWgSpaa	Well maybe. But you have to be really careful! That sounds really fun, though. I wish I could have learned that way!|`|leWOg24kaa	If you follow the safey rules it sounds sweet to me. I mean, I grew up in the country and thats how we was!|`|q1y7kgnEaa	i think it is fine, u know the precautionary measures to take and it sounds like u guys are having fun...i have 4 children, 3 of who help me wherever in the house they want to help me at, i like to make them homemade peanut butter cookies and they always sit in their chairs next to the counter with me and help me roll the dough into balls and put them on the pan while sneaking bits of the tasty dough.....they also help me sprinkle things into what i make and they also help me stir it if i'm standing right with them they also help me do laundry, take out the trash, and anything else they want to do, i encourage it, at this age everything is a learning experience for them as long as it stays safe which it sounds like u are...i wouldnt worry about what anyone else says, u know what is best for your children not anyone else...and my children by the way are ages 6, 4 ,and 2....keep it up it will help her to love everything and to also learn what she does and does not like and it will only help her get smarter about things in the kitchen....your doing a good job.....|`|r9Tp12p0aa	I have a 2 year old old daughter and I started cooking with her when she was a year old! SHe LOVES it! We talk about what it is shes dumping in and how much we need. It's showing her the basics. My mom did it w/ my sister and I when we were younger and we both are naturals at cooking now. I mostly bake with my daughter (cakes, cookies, etc). She really enjoys holding the mixer but the best part is licking the sweet batter off the mixer when we're done! There is not a better lesson than cooking w/ your little one and I think what your friend said is the exact reason why people don't have a clue how to cook these days. It is not dangerous at all unless she is within hands reach to the fire or burner or putting things in the oven. Familyfun.com has fun recipes to do w/ kids, check it out and enjoy this wonderful experience w/ your daughter!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think that would be fun ... it's not like she's preparing lasagna and opening the oven door or something. LOL Just be prepared for a few sneezes in the food. LOL I try to let my son (5) help make the pizza and our kitchen just isn't big enough for two cooks ... and the only place for his chair is right in front of the drawer where I need to get things all the time. But he likes to 'decorate' the pizza, and I always start out things by saying, "Now remember, if you have to cough or sneeze, do it into your elbow!" LOL <br>  <br>  I plan on getting my son more involved in cooking as he gets older ... I think for you and your daughter it would be a lot of fun and a good experience for both of you. :)|`|68c6B8dRaa	"what i was doing weas a good thing teaching her different colors, textures etc and basically just having fun together"<br>  <br>  Yep, for sure. This is a _great_ thing to do with a toddler. It's a mess, but it's loads of fun for all concerned, and extremely educational, indeed.<br>  <br>  Even when I'm not actively involving her in cooking I still keep her in the loop -- I ask her to come smell whenever I open up spices, explain what I'm doing, etc. <br>  <br>  I feel bad for the 4 and 2 year olds not allowed in their mum's kitchen.  :(
QCVzUC1baa	what a nice story with a happy ending.<br>  <br>  I sometimes think Im a bad mother and no matter how many times ppl say dont be silly, you dont believe them.<br>  <br>  My son will be 5 months next week and I oftern look at him and am blown over with how gorgeous he is and how lucky I am.<br>  <br>  When we popped out earlier we were in a lift and I was trying to make my son laugh and by the time we were coming out of the lift he was giggling like mad and a woman waiting to go in gave me a ahhh 'look'<br>  and that was nice made me feel good. Plus ppl are always commenting on how relaxed and good he is and how he is like that because of me.<br>  <br>  P.s You are a good mum :-)|`|sAAnquoTaa	Awww! I'm so happy for you! Just always remember that moment anytime you start to feel that way if you do again and you'll always know you truly are a great mom! <br>     I do sometimes feel like I'm not the best mom, but everytime my baby girl says momma or reaches for me I remember I must be doing something right.|`|8oHlIrLOaa	Well I'm not a mom.. but i am a 13 year old aunt and the first time I heard my 3 year old nephew say he loves me too it was unreal. I couldnt stop smiling(: Sorry, I know that you asked for Moms to answer this question but when I read it thats what came to my mind.|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I DO THIS ALLLLL THE TIME!!!! I feel like I never spend enough time with my older son (17 months old), who is now displaying symptoms of possible delay or autistic behaviour - He has a 5 month old little brother who I am still breastfeeding, and I feel really great about how I'm doing with him, but the older one always seems to get the short end of the stick! But tonight, he was singing a little from his crib when I put him to bed, so I decided to do an extra bum change just in case a dirty nappy was keeping him up - He reached out with a beautiful smile on his face for me from his crib when I walked into his room, gave me the most amazing hug ever, let me change his diaper without a diaper war, and then I sat with him and read him 3 books. I sang "I love you a bushel and a peck," to him, while he closed his eyes and rocked with him. When I put him back in his crib, I rubbed his head while he smiled up at me and I thought for the first time in a long time, "I AM a good mom. I love this little man more than life itself..."|`|qLkknQx1aa	i know i'm not supermom, but i know i'm not a bad mom either. - i'm not perfect, my mother was farrrr from perfect and i have yet to meet any one single person in this world who is perfect.  anyone who says they don't second guess themselves is a liar. - you sound fine to me and i'm glad you had that "moment".  try to keep your head up and not focus so much on the "bad" stuff you THINK you are doing or not doing okay?  if your baby is happy, then you ARE doing a good job!!!|`|4iXL4C6paa	I feel like I am an overall good parent but there is always room for improvement, but I had one of those moments today when my two daughters decided to stuff the bathroom sink with tissue paper and leave the water on until I came in to find the big mess...and I didn't lose it lol so that was a big ahhhaaa|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I also have a depression. Yes every once in a while it just clicks. Hmm.|`|3NoDjKLoaa	ive been having a lot of those moments lately.. my son was having a lot of issues when he was 13 mos to 19 mos.. with speaking.. he wasnt speaking was the problem.. i talked to him all the time and read to him and just thought that maybe i wasnt doing something enough. .maybe i was letting him watch too much tv. or w/e.. now he talks all the time.. hes (almost 24 mos) and he can say and point to almost all his body parts! He can tell me what he wants! Its just exciting everyday hearing him say something to me and im just like wow, we are finally communicating.|`|jBnQiZVFaa	Haha...I think 80% of moms think they are bad moms much of the time.  Although I am sure it is much harder having the depression on top of that.  I guess mine have all been small aha moments.  When my daughter wants to come and snuggle and she sits in my lap and talks to me, that makes me feel like I have been a good mom, that she loves those times to talk and cuddle.  Even things like a big smile on a hard day makes me think I am doing okay.  I am glad that you have your moments too.  It is important to see the rewards for your hard work!|`|y9icmRcYaa	You sound like a fantastic mom! I still have those days where I question my ability as a mother and I have been a mom for 14 years lol. I am only 31 so, I pretty much grew up with my daughter and drawing the line between mom and friend is always tough.. I moved to California from Belfast, Ireland as a teen and needless to say things are done way differently here than back home so I always wonder if the way I am raising my daughter is right. <br>  <br>  I'm sure there are some super moms out there that are brilliant from day one but, for the rest of us, it's a learning process. I'm even sitting here thinking wow, I wish I was as good of a mom as you =) <br>  <br>  You are doing great!|`|j2mRop0laa	Sometimes I think I'm the worst mom in the world when my daughter has issues that are beyond my control and I can't fix everything for her. It's the hardest thing in the world for me and I wonder if I have failed.<br>  <br>  But then, she brings home some huge report with an A+ and tells me about her day and how she has handled people, or talks about her passions and I realize I must have done something right for her to be so wonderful.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	my boys are 5 and 7 and still, i sometimes doubt my parenting skills.  lol!<br>  i think all mothers doubt themselves at times.  this is simply because most mothers are perfectionists.  even as they're doing a good job bringing up their children, they feel they should still be doing more for them.  that's love.  perfectly normal.<br>  but that feeling shouldn't consume you.  <br>  whenever i feel like i'm being a bad mom for spending more time at work than with my boys, i don't get depressed.  i just do my darnest to make up for lost time.  we go biking, we horse around, i really go down on my knees and play in the mud with them.  and yeah, we bake cookies, too.  and then everything is perfect again.<br>  so good for you, mom!  you're doing great! --and please believe me this time, haha!
M5jF5w5Taa	I am sorry for your loss. <br>  <br>  Although I have not helped my preschooler grieve the loss of a person close to him, I recently was moved to hear a radio broadcast of the old episode of Sesame Street when the adult characters explained the death of Mr. Hooper to Big Bird. It was really a great model for explaining death to a small child. From my experience with my son's grief over the loss of his two fish, I realized that they really did a great job of anticipating the questions kids would have at this age. It's probably a good idea for any parent of a small child to watch this episode, knowing that these situations usually arise without warning.|`|NjGeH0wKaa	My condolences.|`|AA10500537	tell him grandpa is in heaven and not suffering anymore.<br>  and at night help him say a prayer for him|`|Jb1qmm1Eaa	I am so sorry for your loss....I will keep you and family in my prayers.<br>   I too have a grieving child (5 yrs old) different circumstances though.<br>  <br>   I worry about what goes through their little minds. As adults, the pain is great and at times hard to deal with. <br>  We are Christians, as well, I thought of counseling too(and still thinking about it)...but I notice that my son seems to be comforted when we start talking about Heaven...Angels...and Gods Grace. It helps to some extent. He still lashes out as well, and cries easily...which he did not do before our loss. I hope to learn from what others have to say as well. <br>  Again, I am truly sorry for your loss. God Bless :)|`|BCgp7GTpaa	Tell him its okay to be sad?  Im not sure if he will even remember this time when he is older...maybe?  or else I would just say treat him like you normally would and tell him its okay to be upset but not okay to take it out on people?|`|P4LBygv2aa	I went through this with my son , in April I found my mom dead , it was so hard for me ,especially since I found her but my son was as close to her as I was , they did everything together , he visited her a lot , she was down the street and we worked together so he was with me there too ,since birth , you have to let him talk to you , as much or as little as HE wants to , just say , I was just thinking of the time my dad and I ....and then say what do you remember ? it will allow him to open up to you , the best thing is to talk about it , not so much the death but the life part and the happy things .
fLsXT4t1aa	Charles, solid and masculine. Charlie is a sweet nickname for a baby boy.<br>  Abraham, grandfatherly but vintage in my opinion.

CN44WsTpaa	I was ready for the next one the day I left the hospital!  I didn't want the experience of being pregnant and waiting for a baby to end.  But I also want to dedicate all that I have to my baby.  I think when she reaches pre school age would be a good time to start.  That way, while she is at school I can tend to a new baby with as much dedication as the first one!|`|pO0s0bhHaa	My son is 2 1/2 - we've been trying for the past 1 1/2 years.

Both born on October 6th, one in 2002 and the other in 2008. My fiance wants to try for a boy (my son is not his biological child) and I am not completely sure I want another. He wants to carry on his family name, it's up to him and his brother and his brother shouldn't be allowed to breed so the pressure is on me or else there will be no more men of his family left after him. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't mind having another baby in a few years but my only worry is the next will be a girl...and you get my drift lol. Part of me wants to have another soon because it was HARD going from a 6 year old who can all but take care of himself to a baby. I love my daughter dearly but it was a major adjustment.
z6IekuwSaa	If it isn't painful for him then he's what they call a happy spitter. That means it isn't reflux. Try sitting him up after a feeding for at least 20 minutes. Also if you are giving him a binkie/pacifier/dummy don't. It causes more air to get sucked in. Make sure you are burping him still.<br>  <br>  I had this prob with my daughter only on breastmilk. It turned out that she was wanting to comfort suck but was overeating, this doesn't sound like what's going on with your son as 6 oz seems reasonable. But the other advice is what the doc gave me when I called|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	My daughter has been on Good Start since she was born (never breastfed) and she had problems spitting up at first. We got the slowest flow nipples when she was about 2 weeks old and that helped a lot. She continued to spit up a lot at daycare and rarely ever at home. It turned out they weren't burping her after 2-3 oz like we did at home...they were letting her go until like 4-5 oz before burping her and she'd spit half of it back up. <br>  <br>  She is almost 5 months now and we still don't let her go more than 4 oz w/o burping her. You didn't mention how often you do it so that may be part of the reason. Some babies eat a whole 6-8 oz w/o burping and some need it every 3-4 oz so you might want to try that and see if it helps. Especially if laying down and picking him back up causes it, it might be that is wasn't digested long enough yet. Good luck!|`|9t171ji1aa	my daughter needed enfamil ar due to relux and frequent spitting up so her doctor wrote up a prescription for wic and they were fine with it as long it was medically necessary.|`|NroZQN5vaa	That doesn't make sense. See if you can get a note from your doctor saying that the regular stuff is making him spit up and that he'd be better on the other stuff. That should be sufficient to get them to give you the stuff you'd rather have. Good luck.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	ok, if he has a cold or even just some extra mucus in his nose he could be spitting that up and it could look like alot.  if he's spitting up that much with no try cutting him back a little, like down to 4 oz and feed him more often instead.  my baby did the same thing.  you can lift one side of his crib mattress.  and when he is done eating make sure he is burped before you put him down.  once you do put him down leave him there for at least 20 minutes  (unless of course he fussing or something) before picking him up.  if you really want him to get the cultures, you can start feeding him regular or baby yogurt around six months.  we just started giving our son yogurt (7 months)  and he does spit up less, whether it's because of the yogurt or because he's just not spitting up any more i have no clue.  could be a coincidence.|`|S3qmkm2Vaa	maybe you are overfeeding him. when my baby was 5mths she was drinking 4-5 oz every 3-4hrs. why don't you try giving him less just more frequent feedings? that was always recommended by my pediatrician. <br>  as far as the formula goes-the green cultures is the one my baby is on right now any other one makes her spit up A LOT so the switch can effect your baby, he might have a sensitive stomach. WIC should give you the green can. explain that your baby doesn't tolerate the other kind, they give it to me!!! <br>  also burp your baby, and give him the milk while he's in a semi-seated position, NOT flat on the bed or crib!!! this is BAD!!!!<br>  i hope this helps. everything I've said came straight from my pediatrician's mouth at one point. <br>  trust me i am a worried mom and double check all my info :)
5tqh0akYaa	i think its normal if they are just being 'friend' type thing, no kissing, nothing out side of school. I had a 'boyfriend' in 5th grade, but it isn't real. So i think its okay as long as they don't take it too far.|`|iYZRZg5Zaa	I personally think it's way too young to go out with other people, but a lot of fifth graders do have boyfriends and girlfriends.  Anyway, you were being a little strict because it's just a movie, but make sure they don't kiss or anything.|`|RoTLnFGZaa	it's too young.<br>  if you wanna let her, tell her that a group of friends has to come along and that an adult needs to be seated somewhere in the theater|`|LTWlBSFNaa	its fine lol when kids say they r going out at that age all they do is hug or maybe just a little kiss on the cheek and its a really big deal when they hold hands so they r nit going to do anything|`|jNgh3e3Faa	WAY TOO YOUNG!<br>  <br>  My daughter is ten and I would not allow that even in a group.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	I would say it is okay AS LONG AS, THERE IS A CHAPERONE.|`|AA10411777	I had a bf in the 3rd grade and up but the changed so quickly and the only thing i ever did with them was hold hands or kiss nothing to serious except one time when i was in the 4th grade I kissed a guy took off my clothes and put on my mothers silk night gown got under the covers with him and kissed I thought that what i was doing was having sex cause that was all they showed in moives she is young but know would be a good time to give her the sex talk 11 year olds are being hosiptallized for anorexia and now having babies|`|ydYi0lu2aa	I don't think so no! I mean I found my true love sometime during elementary school so why can't your daughter? One thing you could do is hire a private spy? They could sit a bit behind your daughter and her friend and make sure nothing happens. I've done this before with all my children and they've never known! Please email me for some numbers to call for some more less expensive people for hire! Good luck with this honey!<br>  <br>  Build me up... Buttercup.|`|yEHdJwVGaa	it's perfectly normal for a 10 yr old to  have a bf. i remember in elementary school people started dating in like 3rd grade. people started kissing a little after that. don't worry, i don't think ur daughter's gonna do anything wrong. even if they kiss, its more likely to be a peck rather that a make out session leading to sex...|`|QNnRVUoiaa	These days, it's normal. <br>  I feel she doesn't know what love is yet and they don't have the right feelings. But is she's ready for this, than let her go for it. You can't really stop it.|`|rRWubfNNaa	definatly not. she is in the fith grade, why dont you like set a age where she can or cant date?|`|NBo2ucWsaa	Far too young. I'm in ninth grade, and I don't have a boyfriend. Never had, and don't plan to until it's important. I'd tell her not until she's older, personally.|`|XGgPhaDbaa	NO NO NO NO way should a 10 yr old go on a date with a boy without parents.  What the heck? She should not be dating until older.<br>  How old were you when you could date?<br>  <br>  10 years old. SHEEESH!|`|rB3cyt0Paa	it's a cartoon go with them but a couple of rows back you don't want her to feel like yur crowding her|`|6T9JNLXmaa	Now-a-days, thats totally normal!<br>  <br>  nothing will happen between them. the boy probably has an older sister or brother, or maybe is just influenced by the media, and just thinks thats cool and that your daughter is cute =D<br>  <br>  its fine =) let her go!!|`|n0uwYsGIaa	yes it is and its just a movie a date and a boyfriend are different things its only a movie but ill admit i didnt go out on a date with a girl its was just crushes and valentines was the real big thing but its ok normal yes|`|NIlDPtNeaa	I have to be honest, they are too young to know everything about love, and to have the rigth feelings.<br>  But if they think they are ready, go for it.|`|Iv8WwN2gaa	my daughter did.i thought it was kinda cute. At first i was uneasy.<br>  The boy was really sweet. He would always walk her home. nothing inappropirate will happen.|`|q4i4O3Wbaa	dang 5th grader going out already thats probably to young depends though is ur daughter responsible do u trust her? it all depends maybe talk to her about this stuff.|`|59CK0DQzaa	yes,just set some limits
6gthdHpnaa	Um, if you're doing something illegal, someone needs to be calling the police, whether or not they're from the school. Your teachers are trying to make sure you make good decisions. They might not be doing that well, but at least they're trying.|`|Jucak0HLaa	No,at my school we all know the teachers get drunk all the time!Like when we come back from Mardi Gras holidays,like half of the staff is gone because they are hungover from the night before.|`|ojTcrqAOaa	Lmao.<br>  No.|`|HOdblqIkaa	when i was in high school the teachers were more like friends for the most part. they know what goes on and they want us to be safe because there isnt really anything they can do outside of school. a few of my teachers and i know some of the coaches would give out their personal numbers in class and say if a student needed a ride or help outside of class, non class related, that they could call at any time. i dont think it was your principals place to call the cops because there really isnt anything they can do but it is good teaching by your english teacher to remind you to have safe sex.|`|5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	You've got to be careful, obviously.<br>  <br>  But you do need to have a word with your Headteacher about the 'english' you're being taught. Or not, as the case may be.<br>  <br>  Try reading your question again. Sorry, but that kind of question proves that you're not old enough to be drinking.|`|CIUAIxXaaa	It really doesn't have anything to do with school from my point of view. But, in my school there is this thing call "A,D.D."..Which means against drunk driving..My teachers always preach about drunk driving. Its pretty hilarious because they teach drunk driving more than we get educated. We actually had an assembly on drunk driving today..(The whole school)..|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	The certainly means squat to you, if you get nit-picky about what a teacher says.<br>  <br>  The law has to do with sex and, drinking.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	My english teacher admits to drinking, and she knows teenagers do it. My health/PE teacher used to be a cop, and he also knows kids experiment with drugs and alcohol, but he doesn't step in either. And most teachers accept that we're going to live the life we want. They also can not get involved with affairs outside of school.|`|e76k5edZaa	WTF kind of school and teachers do you have!<br>  I dont know any school that tries to get that involved, apart from waterloo road that comes on television!<br>  <br>  No school gets that involved with a students social life<br>  Tbf none of out teachers even care<br>  And they have no right to even go through text messages etc.. <br>  That is actually invasion of privacy<br>  <br>  <br>  I feel sorry for you<br>  Your school sounds like a load of balls.|`|y8oWcLSXaa	nah, our schools pretty cool about it.<br>  they just said like dont get arrested at the weekends when your out clubbing and drinking cause it will be harder to get into uni n stuff. <br>  and our teachers are always asking like if we've smoked n stuff.<br>  they dont really care that much in school either, cause at our school discos its like a big drinking session n they only call your parents if youve like ko'ed in the corner, and the bottles of strongbow and stuff are in our hall behind the curtains for like months after, and when these guys came into school gassed, they just laughed at them, haha. x|`|6T9JNLXmaa	my school dont really care. as long as its not taking place at school, of course. lol<br>  <br>  the only thing i can think of is every friday my pe teacher says "have a great weekend, make good choices!" before he dismisses us to the locker rooms.<br>  <br>  but thats about it. =D<br>  <br>  im sorry you have to suffer through all that though. lol ;)|`|AA10411777	All teachers do that because they fear the parents aren't doing it. Btw its illegal to read texts on someone elses cell phone I f you have a phone lock it with a password so your private buissness stays private|`|yEHdJwVGaa	okkkk... i'm only in 8th grade (although kids already lost their virginity) my teachers don't do that... i think it's kinda freaky...
ODJ9YWeAaa	lol dads will always be that way with their daughters. lol mine is that way with me still and im 19 married and have a baby. your dad just loves you. and he wont mind if you date he just wants you safe because he knows how boys are.|`|LoIhwvo9aa	I'm going through it too i am turning 15 in December and next year i start my first year of high school. when we got our school pictures back my dad said I looked 18 Lol but he's really bummed out cause I am his last child and my older siblings are 9, 12, and 14 years older than me and he still wants me to be five...still treats me like I'm five sometimes too....I feel bad though and I know how you feel.|`|dYYYksNOaa	Yeah. My dad was pretty shocked when he found out I had a boyfriend, but he was really accepting of it in the end... more so that my mom, in fact!<br>  <br>  Don't feel pressured to start dating. Dating is when you actually like the person, so only date if you really like him.<br>  <br>  It scared me too, to be honest. But my boyfriend and I have been together eight months and we have something really special.<br>  <br>  I'm not actually 16 yet, but I have gone through this. Email me if you want to talk about it more.<br>  <br>  Good luck and happy early birthday! :)|`|95bn0gDHaa	Yeah.<br>  <br>  I'm best friends with both of my parents.<br>  <br>  Well, I'm only 14, but my dad says he remembers when he could hold me with one arm. lol,<br>  and he says it with this really depressed voice :)<br>  <br>  but we have my little sister, who I think will always but a 6 year old at heart, so at least my dad and mom have that to hold on too :)|`|SiQBOuOLaa	I'm 17 and my dad was very nervous when I told him I had a boyfriend.<br>  He sort of grew distant towards me...<br>  It sort of makes me sad...|`|gTAKftB3aa	im going through this as well<br>  im turning sixteen in march :)|`|xM4CumQoaa	yeah, i think a lot of parents have a hard time leting their children grow up. be patient with him and maybe talk to him. tell him your not 5 anymore and you need to grow up one day and that day is today.|`|CIUAIxXaaa	I know what you mean. My Mom and Dad are having a really hard time with me growing up. They don't want to see me with any boys or having my own car+license.

My Mom sometimes acts like she doesn't care but she will always be like, "I can't beleive my baby is growing up"...haha.

0qP8gLpyaa	I think it's pathetic that the parents are like that and don't do anything to make their lives healthier by losing the weight and watching what they eat, but to me it is up there with child abuse to allow a child to gorge on things and not be active to the point they become grossly obese. You know if they don't now they will develop joint and back problems, heart issues and possible liver/kidney failure from the weight in addition to cholesterol issues and blood pressure problems. It's just not healthy at all.  It's irresponsible.  <br>  The only thing worse is seeing people like that and their cart is full of chips, soda, twinkies and junk rather than healthier foods.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	You're killing yourself by smoking cigarettes but want to judge people who are overweight? You know, smoking puts just as much of a strain on the lungs and heart as being overweight and obese. Worry about other peoples health after you start worrying over yours.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I think it is bad if it would be a disease causeing it but if it is just lazyness then it is bad bc they are just making it rough on thereself & it is kind of sad to see someone goin though it but there is a limit<br>  <br>  purplehi hahaha|`|a6e7SRYzaa	It sure isn't healthy, but I wouldn't be judging seeing as you smoke and that isn't healthy either.|`|27jdKozNaa	just smoke another cig & mind your own Business I guess.|`|BUI9HnH1aa	i feel sorry for the kids|`|tht0DrHsaa	I think Oh No i wonder what that classy woman over there smoking a cigarette is thinking.  You don't know their situation. Not everyone that is over weight is lazy and pigs some people have medical conditions that cause them to be over weight.  Its not like you are the healthiest person in the world.  Not only are you killing yourself but you are polluting the air that we all breath.  Why don't you think about that while you are passing judgement on everyone else.|`|d9725fed349940ce5f2902b12785a16caa	I think its not our part to judge people based on their looks. Who knows what health problems they can have, that they may or may not have caused.  Better yet, kids what do you think of the man that stands on the corner with nothing better to do then think about how much better they are then you and point out why?..... All that and im a thin guy.|`|XIcg2Blgaa	I almost consider this abuse! Parents should not allow children to become that obese. Not only does it cause MULTIPLE health problems, it also results in endless tormenting|`|NjGeH0wKaa	i am sorry that the kids were cursed with such fat parents they will be tormented for their entire childhood.|`|tlbTwn9faa	Its not good for their health.<br>  but then again neither is smoking. Lol.
7jXChfBNaa	well just because you are pregnant that doesn't mean that you can go to the dr for free, unless she has medical coupons or something?? and as far as the housing thing goes she will not be able to get it any faster than anybody else. my sister in law is pregnant and she asked if she could get on section 8 and they told her that it is a very long list so it really doesn't matter just like you said. i know a lot of people like that who just make up stories to make you jealous or just for fun and eventually you will just get fed up and do away with those people. hope that helps ya=}|`|WbJPQM1naa	what is your question?  Why worry if she wants to lie about stuff? You do the right thing and live right and don't worry about others.  If you don't trust her to tell you the truth, say so.  Tell her you don't feel comfortable continuing your friendship with her because you don't believe that she is telling you the truth.  It's doesn't have to be a competition, though.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	tell her you don't care
AA10411777	OKay so drink coffee if it calms you down instead of making you hyper you have ADD. Speed works the same way but its illegal. I wouldn't do the meds I never had them but my husband said they made him feel like a zombie during the day and he would puke at night. Meditating, making lists, and yes drinking coffee are the things i used to help me focus on my task at hand. But i still have moments where...Oh look a kitty!

Yc2xj1Wpaa	Hm thats weird, Which OPK are you using? I used Answer and First response and they gave me positive from feb 10-13, which i thought was to many days for it to be positive, i bd on 8 9 10 11 13 14 15 16...thought i was pregnant got my period today im sad :*(<br>  <br>  Just have sex everydayyyyyyyyy, thats what im gonna do when my period ends<br>  <br>  Good Luck and tonz of baby dust to you<br>  <br>  <br>  Well my sister had bought the first response and once she got the positive, she said she didnt test anymore(thats what ur supposed to do,not test after first pos) but i couldnt help myself,i even tested 6 times in one day to see if it was positive lol...but she got pregnant that 1st time and she has ovarian cysts..good luck|`|muBb414baa	Hey I used First Response.. <br>  <br>  This is the thing.. u always have LH in your system so younever want to test first thing in the am because it gives you a positive because it has had time to build up all night.  Pee and drink regularly.  Try to restrict your drinking 2 hours before testing and test around 2 pm everyday.  I started throwing a test in my purse once a day ... i hope this helps mama... good luck|`|OiFNZnwOaa	i would try another test, especially if you have had a few drinks throughout the day as this would have diluted your urine...<br>  i personally would go by the positive result.<br>  good luck and baby dust
H74F8jxuaa	No, you don't have to buy anything.  What you do is stick your middle finger up there until you feel your cervix and rub your finger around on it a little bit, take your finger out and see what the cm looks like on your finger.  If there is nothing there, record dry and you aren't very fertile (this is usually right after your period and right after ovulation).  If there is sticky feeling cm, record sticky and you're getting more fertile, but still not much.  If there is cloudy/lotiony cm, then record creamy and you are fertile.  If there is watery or eggwhite (clear, slick, and stretchy) then you are at peak fertility and ovulation time.  <br>  As far as the cervix position, you need to start feeling your cervix right after your period and feel it everyday to know the changes.  Every woman is different and I can't tell you what your cervix will do, but I do know that it starts out low, firm, and closed and then when you are ovulating, it is high, soft, and open.  When it is firm, it feels like the tip of your nose.  When it is soft, it feels like your lips.  It really takes one cycle of checking the mucus and position to know what to look for, that is how I found out so much.  Here is a tip on finding your cervix, when you insert your finger and you find your cervix, the opening feels like an x.  Hope this helps.  Best of luck to you!|`|S5n5Za78aa	Every woman has a pattern thats unique to them.<br>  <br>  Cervical fluid is produced by your cervix as you approach ovulation due to increased estrogen. It flows from the cervix into the vagina where it can easily be observed. Your cervical fluid changes throughout your cycle, increasing in quantity and becoming more clear and stretchy as you get closer to ovulation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid checking your cervical fluid just before or after intercourse as arousal and seminal fluids will skew your observations. The best way to check your cervical fluid is to make observations when you go to the bathroom. After you wipe, you can wipe outside your vagina a second time and note what, if anything, you find on the bathroom tissue. This will soon become second nature and you will find yourself noticing your cervical fluid every time you go to the bathroom.You can also use your clean fingers to check and you may also notice some cervical fluid in your underwear. <br>  <br>  In the most common pattern, cervical fluid starts out dry after your period and then gets sticky, then creamy, then wet and watery, becoming most like eggwhite as you get closer to ovulation. Usually it dries up quickly after ovulation. You may get different types of cervical fluid on the same day. Always record your most fertile cervical fluid to make sure that you do not miss a potentially fertile day.

See if you can find the same picture frame and buy another one.<br>  <br>  Maybe she will unground you : )|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Its prefect fair!<br>  She hit you, but that doesn't mean you can hit her back!<br>  <br>  My mom hit my little sister because she dumped nail polish remover on my brothers head and got it in his eyes (and they are now at the hospital) and do you think my sister hit her back? I dont f-ing think so!<br>  <br>  Next time dont hit your damn mother,even if she hits you first!|`|HOdblqIkaa	im gonna take a guess and say that you arent supposed to be playing football in the house. so if you broke the rules and broke something in the process i can see why she would be mad. she shouldnt have hit you but you shouldnt have hit her back either. it doesnt seem unfair that your grounded tho.|`|gmaCvh00aa	You keep your picture frames outside?  <br>  <br>  You hit your mother, you really deserve death, so you got off easy.  I would have broken your fingers, you nasty little bastard.|`|6XcUZI9Yaa	I would have smacked you, and then shipped you off to military school.<br>  <br>  Learn some respect|`|pOZubuOcaa	You should never Smack your mom<br>  <br>  i think she just got carried away when she hit you though|`|l1STgPyRaa	don't hit girls even moms are girls|`|jh1pGSfWaa	why would u hit ur mother|`|NBo2ucWsaa	First of all, never hit your mother. If she hits you, call the police. That's classic child abuse (if you're a minor, which your grammar makes me believe so). That's why she grounded you. But if you're mother hit you for breaking a picture frame, she must be stressed. Look at this situation from all angles. <br>  You need to talk to her about it. If you hit her, let her know you're sorry, and then tell her that she shouldn't have hit you, because it's not only illegal but it's also no way to solve a situation as such. <br>  Good luck to you and your mother. Resolve a situation, next time, BEFORE it gets out of hand.|`|JN5MFH0uaa	Hasn't she ever told you never to throw things in the house? Even if she hasn't, its common sense not too. And maybe that picture frame meant something to her. You'd be upset too if someone broke something of yours that was special to you wouldn't you? And she smacked you, get over it. You shouldn't of been throwing a football in the house. I can't believe you smacked her though. Maybe you should of instead APOLOGIZED rather then being violent and you wouldn't be grounded if you had calmly explained what happened. I hope she grounded you for a decent amount of time for hitting her.|`|gA22md42aa	umm no playing ball in the house ... be very careful around breakable items duh! <br>  <br>  That usually is a rule at home.  <br>    you are not telling the whole story.  Did she see you break it?<br>  Or did she come home to find out that it was broken? Did you try to blame someone else?  <br>  <br>  You broke something she valued.  What she values you should value as well.  <br>  <br>  You are a coward for smacking your mom.  you should look for someone your own size and try to smack him around.  I'm betting you were running your mouth off too about how stupid the picture frame is.|`|rnaq8Yp9aa	W.O.W yuh got courage kid HA HA lolZZz. i would never<br>  she would probably kill me<br>  thinkin its bad now?? do it again lolz<br>  but yea i do think its unfair because your mom is aloud to hit you and its called child abuse<br>  a kid hits there mom it goes with them the rest of there sad little lives lol|`|NLYPIXcUaa	Jesus,why would you hit your own mother. She went through 9 months of hell so you could live. She probably payed for everything you've ever owned and you repay her by breaking something of hers and smacking her. You deserve to be grounded,brat.|`|ywlhky4uaa	Sounds like she has anger issues , but think about it , wouldnt it be kinda weird for you to hit her , and her NOT ground you ?<br>  <br>  My mum hits me all the time but i dont hit her back cos ive accepted that she is a ********* :)|`|QNnRVUoiaa	you smacked her back?<br>  that's why she grounded you.<br>  i know, it's so unfair that our parents can hit us and we just have to take the bullshit and stand there. lord. i think you're mom should've understood that what you did was an accident.|`|KtCdVaz9aa	It is unfair, but it is also dis respectful to hit your mom back. So next time try to hold your temper and resist the urge to hit her back. I had to do it for 12 yrs of my life|`|m7nrGSxEaa	Omg my mom does that all the time sept some times I hit her first but..<br>  <br>  I believe that if someone hits you then you hit them back it's like common sense.<br>  <br>  Sorry .., be more careful playing foot ball next time|`|QQE58qFQaa	Your a coward<br>  <br>  firstly, NEVER EVER hit a girl<br>  second, NEVER EVER hit your mother<br>  <br>  you are very disrespectful|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Smacking your mom back? Yeah it was wrong of her, but don't you go and do it too. No wonder she grounded you.|`|1enIWBGnaa	Why are you complaining when it was YOU who broke something?<br>  NEVER strike your parent(s)!!!!!  Keep your football for outside activities and stop whining!|`|U3TcMDkuaa	super unfair but you just gotta take it.. sorry it sux but thats life|`|XSNdj7Meaa	You are lucky to not be sitting in juvenile detention.

You might end up on Maury where those wild teens beat up their parents. You and your mom are both stupid. 2 points. One more thing,would you let your children beat on you and why th hell are you throwing a damn football in the house,where's your daddy,very unclassy?:-(|`|r39EDGhPaa	Oh god, some of these people are just so ignorant.<br>  It's okay for women to hit their children, but if the child hits them back, it's SOOO BAD because she's a girl?<br>  <br>  No.<br>  1. It's not okay to hit someone whether it's a girl hitting a girl, a girl hitting a guy, a boy hitting a boy or a boy hitting a girl.  They were BOTH wrong.  He should not be getting bitched at so much for hitting his mother just because she is a girl.  She hit him first, it's stupid that we are expected to just deal with it because we're the children.  We weren't asked to be born.  That's why some of us don't give our parents enough respect.. they don't give it to us.<br>  <br>  2. You're right.  It's unfair.  If you were to hit her, but she never hit you, then I'd say you should be grounded.  You didn't mean to break anything... accidents happen, she could have grounded you for that rather than hitting you.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	actually...this is kinda fair<br>  like you broke something and she grounded you<br>  but she had no reason to hit you maybe a lil smack but nothing big (on the butt)<br>  and you had absolutely no reason to smack her back have some respect!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  hope u guys work things out|`|5tqh0akYaa	you don't hit your elders, period.<br>  <br>  and how are you on the computer if your grounded. haha your the most brilliant troll|`|ojTcrqAOaa	LIKEEE,<br>  UGHHH.<br>  <br>  Tehee,thats funny.

This is awesome(: Your daughter could serioulsy think about having a career in writing. You should be proud of her. Ignore the people that say it isnt good. They probably didnt read it, but if they would have they would too be impressed!|`|n5Mrrf9Gaa	Holy crap this is so good.<br>  Does she watch Kyle XY?<br>  That show sounds this story.<br>  You should see it.|`|hZf8aJkYaa	I really really really like it.|`|Dt44artYaa	awesome|`|U6LrVba5aa	i think its great :) she is a good writer|`|f61TFB6taa	no|`|3H0hluVoaa	ITS GREAT! Not many 13 year olds can write like that. Its sad really, but this is excellent. Its on the road to be a great writer. I really sincerely love it. Matthew sounds like a really interesting character.|`|qgmfazqEaa	i didnt read the entire thing...i thought the opening<br>  "my brother is a genius" was pretty good.<br>  definitely encourage your daughter to continue reading and writing.<br>  i think she obviously has knack for it|`|rgOPYV7naa	it's great! totally makes me want to continue reading<br>  what's it called?/ keep me posted on what it's called because it looks like it's going to be really, really good. <br>  <br>  some of the grammar and punctuation is off, but i think it gives it character. and the speaker, the sister, sounds like a ten year old. i don't know if your daughter did this on purpose or not, but again, personality. <br>  <br>  she's got talent. encourage her.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	not really<br>  its far to unbelievable<br>  not my cup of tea<br>  but, the writing style is quite good,<br>  its just the subject thats seems a bit farfetched|`|rB3cyt0Paa	yea awesome|`|gjb6ZoXHaa	wow your brother is really smart. <br>  that is a very good story for a 13 year old you should definately receive a A|`|c7XrBgz2aa	Good but why isn't your daughter asking this its sweet|`|2nOC6OZHaa	That's amazing! I want to read more. Can you email some more of it to evilsocksofdoom@gmail.com ?|`|6az2lSc7aa	That is a really well written story. She's a really good writer for her age.|`|BZJGNFymaa	That's great, but tell her not to let it go to her head!  You can always improve upon your skills.  I hope that she keeps writing as long as she enjoys it.<br>  <br>  Hey, if she manages to get a short work published, it will look great on her college applications a few years from now. ;)|`|BhkvwNNraa	I like it so far. I hope she finishes it.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	What a great read. I really enjoyed it, and am amazed that this was written by a 13 year old. You should be prepared, this girl has real talent to be able to write a piece like this at her age. <br>  <br>  Wow. <br>  And tell us ~ is there any truth to her brother's character in this story? I find this very interesting!|`|HJXezEuLaa	I'm fourteen, and always wanted to be a writer, so I'd love to critique this.<br>  <br>   In truth, I'm not sure IF its well done, or bad. At the back of my mind, it says 'Stiff in some sort of way, and transition is a bit off.' Plus, the basic reasoning of it is bad too-'When he was five, and I, eight, our parents gave us permission to hike BY OURSELVES in dangerous territory! If a intellectual was reading this, his thoughts would lead immediately 'I must hypothesize this into the fact that this is a subtle representation that the parents of the children don't even bother to even realize the danger the young children can get into. They don't have very caring parents.' I am not sure about the imagery, or metaphors (whatever there're called)...For some reason, even though at first, it seems good, the overall composition of it is back. The imagery of it is quite well done though, and the vocabualary used should be complimented. <br>  <br>   Summarizing: Your daughter did well with the imagery, and she used much of it, more then I do. Though, that doesn't make up for the fact that the story just seems a bit off-Good for a 13 year old, but, any avid reader would think it isn't a story worth reading. For some reason, even though the language used should be advanced, it seems very childish, not sure why. Don't get me wrong! The imagery she used beats my dry writing, and adds color. A good idea is to cultivate the potential talent she has, unless its like my ability to automaticly get better at everything I do overtime. XD<br>  (Not sure about my words, but it is a good story, I think most of the grammar is horrid though.)|`|MsLKIJWJaa	Wow!!! I loved it. I want to read more of it. Is it true, though? your son is  a genius? I think your 13 year old is a genius as well because not many can write as well as she can at that age. I have met college students that lack a lot of knowledge in their writing. I like how she uses details and pretty much I can visualize it in my head. Its awesome.|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	Its great... is this true or just a story? It really pulls you in, something i would read for sure, and I'm not much of a reader, but yes, very good, great writer. Mabye put in in order a bit though, you jump from ages a bit.|`|YsDwo7Dqaa	Well i take it that it isn't real, it seems to be starting off pretty well.|`|YuuoWS14aa	so far its relli good, except that she just kinda keeps rambiling on and on about "one time" "and this other day" "and he once" mabey she should only say a few then put the others stratigically in other places in the book, but i like it so far, im intrested in knowing where this story is going...|`|kGSZvLxbaa	Wow that is REALLY good it caught my attention at once. Especially since who doesnt want a genius sibling to do ur hmwrk lol just kidding but keep writing!! Could you email me the rest at flip-flop-55@hotmail.com? That was amazing!|`|qGD0aTjQaa	its really good! it seems more like a short story, though, not a book.. she should draw out the story a bit more b.c if she makes it a novel she'd make some moolah XD

tcHkn0VIaa	It is possible- some women do not show up on hpt's until 8 weeks so go to the dr and have a blood test. GOOD LUCK|`|V8GrFx0jaa	It is possible to have a false negative.

EvRIwz4Laa	First, feeling down in the dumps does not always mean you are depressed. So as you said, you can take vitamins (as it may be a vitamin deficiency). Make sure you are getting enough sleep and sometimes getting into a regular workout routine can help. Also, it could just be the added stress of being a single mom. However, if you have been treated for depression in the past, you are more likely to suffer postpartum depression than a woman who has never suffered from depression. Post-postpartum depression could still affect you a year after pregnancy. If none of the things above work, it may be worth your while to at least talk to your doctor. (s)he may have some advice, and if you end up needing medication, there are far more options available now than even a year ago so you may find a mild medication that works way better for you with less side effects than your other experience.|`|cfdooGylaa	Postpartum depression can last for several months. Are you suffering from that? If not it could just be the stress from caring for the baby. I'm a 21 y/o nearly single mom (the father is around but barely sees her) and as much as I love my daughter I can be quite irritable from the stress and exhaustion of taking care of her on my own. Try to relax as much as you can. Your doctor may also have the answer as to what you may do about this. Good luck!|`|rxrw4WNRaa	Ask your Doctor about post partum depression|`|yQiUzB0faa	You can try 5-htp or St. Johns Wort. They are mood suppressants.
NysFTExhaa	With identical twins the egg splits between 1-13 days after fertilization.  If it's 1-3 days they'll share nothing, if 4-8 days they'll share a placenta and if 9-13 days they'll share everything.   We knew for sure with our twins at 7 weeks, it was as clear as day.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	it may sometimes take 8 weeks but usually they will see at the 1st visit but some cases how found twins at 25 weeks or even not until delivered|`|C7Qr20J6aa	not long
44VpxjtCaa	You should probably find out if you are for sure first, & if the test results show that you are then you should sit down with your dad & his gf. Just tell them that you want to talk to them about something serious and tell them that this is something really hard for you to go through it all alone and you need their support.|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	the easiest way I found to do it (and I was 16)  was to come out and give them the test and say "Im pregnant." Or sit down with them and say that you need to talk to them seriously.|`|4T3YHHHZaa	if i was ur parents i would beat ur *** pull a chris brwon on u|`|AA12147036	No matter what happens they'll always be there for you.<br>  <a href="http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restricted-Act.463583" rel="nofollow">http://www.authspot.com/Poetry/The-Restr...</a>|`|audGLNvxaa	you should just be honest and straight forward with all your family. if they find out that you hid it from then it will be worse than just being honest up front.
FkGh0LuWaa	Crayola TaDoodles Washable First Marks are great for this age because they wont break and they are easy to hold on to.  You could also try washable markers, finger paints, and foam stickers.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Maybe Crayola washable paints? <br>  <br>  We tried Color Wonder when my son was about that age - yeah, it doesn't rub off onto other things, but it's like painting with Crisco. Not exactly the cleanest stuff and it can still get a waxy, filmy residue on things, especially if they want to really go at it.<br>  <br>  You could try some non-toxic finger paints. Otherwise I would try telling him not to break the crayons or your will have to take them away. Or if he's like my 2 year old who complains about her brother breaking them, I'll just tell her to use the other end. :)<br>  <br>  ETA: Play Doh is a good idea, as someone mentioned. Just make sure he doesn't eat it - although it's non-toxic, it's recommended for ages 3 and up.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You need Crayola Twistables:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.crayola.com/products/list.cfm?categories=TWISTABLE,CRAYONS" rel="nofollow">http://www.crayola.com/products/list.cfm...</a><br>  <br>  My sister, a primary school teacher, got them for my 1.5yo for Xmas. She said they were all the rage in the lower grade classrooms. I can see why; I am never buying regular crayons again...<br>  <br>  The Crayola washable paints really are washable, too. I have hardwood floors; no problem there, and no laundry problems even when it's dried in and there's no stain remover.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Look in Target, i saw some crayons there for toddlers, they were in the shape of a triangle and were very thick so he might not be able to break them.  Crayola has alot of toddler coloring supplies out, Target seems to have the best selection.  Playdoh is great, water color, the paint books that you use water and color comes out, alos the color wonder markers and paper.  A chalk board is also good.  If you have a playroom and are daring you can buy paint that is a chalkboard so they have their own chalk board, we dont have the room so I got an easel, my kids loved it.  It had dry erase(never used, markers are to tempting and dangerous) on one side and a chalk board on the other, the chalk comes off the walls and couch very easily.  they love finger paints, I hate them though, very messy.  i let them do it outside in the summer.  Sidewalk chalk for the warmer days.  My son loved stamps, they have washable ink and you can get stamps in the dollar store.  Stickers, also in the dollar store.  Glue sticks and those foam cutouts, also in the dollar stores.  He might be to young for some, just some ideas.|`|umGi6gTcaa	my daughter is 2 and breaks crayons with a mere look. I don't care but since you do crayola makes crayons that are held by a big plastic ball also bath time crayons are in a plastic shell. Jade loves her bath tub crayons, before her bath we usually play with water paints. During the day if she's not interested in crayons we usually play with some play-doh. People complain about how messy it is but if you just let it dry it's easy to get out of carpet and if it get's lleft and drys out massaging a drop or two of water at a time in it will make it doughy again.|`|nDEVWjCEaa	I dont think that i will matter  , My daughter is the same way..  I just buy her cheap dollar store crayons.. she has also gotten into markers but make sure that they are washable....|`|1enIWBGnaa	Toddlers just do not have the motor skills to handle most items.<br>  At his age, just buy some paper, finger paints and let him dip is hands in the paint and then press his hands onto the paper.<br>  What you really need to do is buy some flash cards; alphabet letters, numbers, shapes and colors.  He'll love them and the more you do for him now - the easier it will be when he begins school.|`|3WD96VDFaa	Crayon has those markers where they can only color on certain types of papers, so you won't have to worry about him coloring all over the wall. I'm sure they still have them because my son uses them as well. I haven't had a problem with them since. = )

It's okay..... I don't live in hicktown though, for sure! I live more in the city/suburbs. The people are mean, and winter weather sucks. It rains all the freaking time, it's boring, and people can't make good food like in the south. I was born in Houston, and I prefer the south. (The people are nicer, and the food is better, except I don't like the bugs.) The nice thing about where I live though, is that most people are very liberal. I hate how everyone is all "Go green" over here. I could honestly care less. I don't believe in global warming. I support recycling, but everyone is so over the top here, and they like all like trees and mountains. I don't swim in the lake, I don't hike, I don't ski, I hate dirt, I hate the forest, I don't like animals.... I am not the typical Washingtonian. But seriously, some people over here are so stuck up!!|`|6T9JNLXmaa	i live in washington. <br>  <br>  i cant stand it! =/<br>  <br>  the main thing i hate about it is the weather. its disgusting. rainy. cold. ugg.<br>  <br>  my school is in in the woods in the middle of nowhere. and its completely hick town. seriously, theres hicks everywhere. and my school is also known as one of the most racist schools ever. which suckssss. =(<br>  <br>  i would really give almost anything to live in cali though! i was born there and i visit my family down there every summer and i love it! =D thats where im moving when im old enough!!! haha.|`|eZgT6erSaa	I live in IL its cool especially in Chicago<br>  and the fave history i like in Chicago<br>  was the Great Chicago fire<br>  1 its soccer name too and i like soccer<br>  2 its the biggest fire i know<br>  its good whether and school and<br>  also you should go to Pierce downer<br>  cause my school won the blue ribbon on 2007|`|6pEDLnrzaa	I like in Michigan, In a thumb(: The land of extreme coldness, except for right now.

dDVAUA9saa	Nobody can tell you for sure.  But rest assured that you are not alone.  I too drank before I knew I was pregnant.  We weren't even "trying", we had sex once about 6 weeks after I went off the pill, so I thought the chances were one in a million.  I got pregnant in early July and didn't find out until mid-August.  In the meantime, we had been at a friend's cottage for a week AND a wedding.  I was completely 100% convinced that my baby would have FAS.  But she doesn't, and she's perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Women often drink before they know they are pregnant.  It's too late now to do anything about the past, just stick to your pact to not drink again for the remainder of your pregnancy.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	If you are only 9 weeks I think the baby will be fine.  Just consult with your DR and be honest with them! Trust me I am sure you are not the only one that has had that talk with them!  It is always better to be honest then sorry!  Usually they say that anything before you knew you were pregnant will be okay.<br>  <br>  A baby is truly a blessing from God, Do not regret the past just do better in the future and know that God has an awesome plan for your life and the baby's life.   God loves you no matter what!|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	if you quit then theres nothing they can do. its your child. you live with what you have done. the drinking wasnt very smart on your part but hey we all make mistakes. but dont worry. just be happy with the baby. they are a great gift. i love my baby boy|`|yKS2UI87aa	I had drank before I knew I was pregnant (for the 1st month). The important thing is that now you know you won't anymore. As long as you don't you shouldn't have to worry about FAS. good luck!!!|`|d5fd9d057a20f9f41b37d39a5288a98faa	Well, you cant know for sure what the effects will be until the birth. You will not lose custody unless you keep drinking and the Dr knows you were drinking. I advise you not to mention it. I would say there is a chance the baby may have FAS because the time you drank was when the organs were developing, as was the nervous system, but maybe not, maybe your baby got lucky =) I am glad you quit and remember always put the baby first even when its hard! GL and congrats! I hope you have a happy & healthy pregnancy!|`|GdiyfNCgaa	technically, in the first trimester, drs say drinking is okay.<br>  i have a friend that was drinking heavily before she found out she was preg, and her dr said it was okay, she just needed to make sure no more:)<br>  i wouldnt sweat it<br>  <br>  i have never ever heard of custody being relenquished because of that if it was purely incidental.<br>  if you continued drinking, regardless...i could imagine it.<br>  but still never heard of it.|`|KZ0beURiaa	Your only human, and sometimes we all do things we shouldn't, BUT FAS is sorta rare, from what ive learned u would have to drink more than what u did by far, if for some reason something like that would occur, its your child, and no matter what that wud be your child to love. I would just be calm, stressing about it isnt goin to help! just be calm and try to think positive! Im sure nothing is wrong! Best of luck to you and may your pregnancy be amazing! =)<br>  <br>  If anyone judges you, dnt listen! they shouldnt judge you at all. Im sure they have done things in their life that they wouldnt wanna be judged for!|`|NOWPlaUXaa	Don't worry too much.. I drank probably much worse than that with my son for the first little bit of my pregnancy (before I had any clue) and when I found out I quit.. in the back of my mind it bothered me and I worried endlessly, thankfully he's just fine.. smart little boy too so try not to worry, doctor will let you know if anything looks awry in the ultrasounds so you've done the best thing you can.. you cut the stuff out. :)  Take care.. try not to stress too much, I'll pray for your little chicken nugget (sorry it's what I used to call mine when he was baking in the oven LOL) Best wishes sweetie..|`|iU5EzYUMaa	Chances are your drinking early in your pregnancy will not have any affect to your child.The good news is that you stopped! Congrats!! Now that's just the kind of thing that will give your beautiful baby the fighting chance it needs to be born a healthy baby.<br>  <br>  In Europe women drink one to 2 glasses of wine while pregnant. In fact if you google drinking practices of women around the world you will see that there is a great debate on how much is an acceptable amount. Not saying that it is ok to have those glasses but just to say that women in Europe a glass to increase circulation and have healthy beautiful babies everyday.<br>  <br>  Since you've stopped all together I'd just go with that until after the baby is born and after you finish nursing. Not too much longer now to go without.<br>  <br>  In the meantime your worrying about the early days isn't doing you or the baby any favours. Relax, be happy and look forward to the days ahead in the great experience of being pregnant!|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Stay sober, and follow a healthy lifestyle. Eat right and exercise, don't strain and don't over do it. Rest when you need it. I hope you have good supportive friends and family, that is always a bonus.<br>  <br>  What's done is done. Focus on your future and do the best you can with what you have.
tcHkn0VIaa	you need to stay away from that until the end of your first trimester at least to avoid miscarriage then i would ask your doc.|`|l46COY9eaa	I understand that it's the fumes that can be hazardous, not the chemicals because the chemicals can't seep through, but try to hold out until at least the 2nd trimester, I am, and I have an awful bunch of fuzzy greys around my head and my highlights are all grown out!|`|04fd2039534f9759f9ec4ae1101ff131aa	I'm 40 weeks and my hair is a mess. I haven't done anything to it other than cut it. You definately shouldn't do anything in your first trimester because the baby is developing its major organs. If you realy want to afterwards, talk to your doctor in your 2nd trimester. My doctor said it wasn't recommended. I have friends who did throughout their pregnancies but I chose not too as I would feel guilty if it caused any harm.|`|8PkEkTcZaa	no do not dye your hair while you are pregnant its not healthy for the baby leave your hair how it is and wait it out till the baby is born

First of all the poster did not ask anyone's opinion on whether or not using a harnass was a good idea or not so that alone should be a red flag that this is not "your" platform to give you opinion.  Secondly, let me say, I was lost for 4 hours in Disney World when I was 4 years old, and my Mother almost had a nervous breakdown.  I "walked" away, but if I had been on a harnass then I could not have...  you don't want to have a child who is excited about walking to wander off so you do this to protect the child.  <br>  <br>  People who can not anwer the posters question should not respond.

frpCK0utaa	its called implanation bleeding, and only about 30% of women experience it. Its usually light brown to pink in color, never anything like a regular period. It also shows up about a week or so before your period is scheduled to start.<br>  <br>  It can happen, so dont lose hope.
n1vKoto7aa	My daughter uses (and loves) her pacifier, but CHEWS on her pointer fingers and it drives me nuts because the same thing happens to her: she has "bloody" (not bleeding) blisters on both fingers!!! Sometimes they're even swollen. It freaks me out and it looks like it must hurt but I don't know how to get her to stop. I posted a question about it about a month ago and the general advice I got was that as long as it wasn't bothering her, I don't need to do anything and eventually she'll grow out of it. If you're really concerned, or if it seems like it IS hurting her, talk to your doctor. Pediatricians have seen it all and probably know things that we would never think of.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	My 8 month old sucks her thumbs so much that there are rough blisters on them!

A Bandaid is definately a choking hazard!! She will just wonder what it is and start to suck at it. I know this because my son is 11 months and today he sliced his finger on a cardboard box he was playing with so I put a bandaid on it, and within 5 minutes the bandaid was gone, and i noticed him chewing on something...so ya... it was the bandaid!|`|6AvVVzsnaa	My baby had that blister on her thumb for like a couple of days like 2 months ago.

epLfYG7Kaa	Wow, those are some really cool names! I like a lot of them!<br>  Here are my favorites:<br>  - Deacon (Reese Witherspoon's son has that name also :-) <br>  - Ashlan (I love it as a girl's name, with the spelling Ashlyn. I think it looks a little more feminine. I dont really care for it as a boy's name though.)<br>  - Brodie (I like that spelling!)<br>  - Adel<br>  - Korbin<br>  - Linkin (Thats awesome!!!)<br>  - Kaleb (prefer Kaileb, but still love the name!)<br>  <br>  Nice job! :-)|`|scC872nraa	I have a friend but his name is spelt like "Korbyn" it's french. Desmon is a nice sounding name, but as for Draper I don't think it would be my first pick but it is very unique!

Those are my cousins names :) Good luck !|`|lbThMxj7aa	Desmond<br>  Linkin<br>  jozsef|`|hmqmGPvbaa	Adel Deacon :)|`|YMKSgHTtaa	I like them all! haha <br>  <br>  I've always thought Jayler would be a cool name for a boy. :]|`|lzKjHGWJaa	Sage boy baylea girl|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I'm sorry, but I really don't like any of them.<br>  Declan is cool, and so is Kaleb, which I prefer spelled Kaileb. Reed is also nice<br>  <br>  But:<br>  Raab - looks like Saab, the car<br>  Ashlan - that looks a little too feminine, but I don't really care for it either way<br>  Draper - sounds like the meaning would be "one who drapes"<br>  Linkin - Linkin Park, spell it correctly<br>  Byron - a little too old school<br>  Adel - looks too much like Adelle, the girl's name<br>  Jozsef - horrid, horrid, horrid. Really? Just spell it Joseph!<br>  Brodie - looks like it would only fit a boy between the ages of 1-3<br>  <br>  sorry, but I think you should spell some of these names correctly and... I dunno. good luck. By the way, Jaylor makes me think of a jailer|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Sawyer Reed ? (very cute)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Please don't spell it as Jozsef.

The Black Dahlias been done to death though. a couple movies and more books then i can name. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|9LTWa08Laa	Black Dahlia sounds more interesting<br>  <br>  & every teacher has probably read a student research on AIDS so it'd be boring. the Black Dahlia will catch & draw in his attention immediately.|`|7MKmxkjlaa	i think the aids one would be more interesting ... actaully if you do that one ... can you send it to me ... sounds interesting.|`|AA10411777	I would go with what happened to the black dahlia. Scientist still aren't sure the exact way we ( as a specis contracted AIDS)|`|DkT8znckaa	Black Dahlia! I think that's really cool. The Black Dahlia is more of a mystery, opinion kind of thing, where as while AIDS is too, it's all medical and stuff...... there is a lot of info on both, so they'll both be easy to research.|`|IEzkCljmaa	Aids and which ever you do can you email it to me i think both would be pretty cool to read  My email is dads_girl_jessica@yahoo.com|`|vj3WSxzWaa	I think Black Dahlia would be more interesting and fun to research!<br>  Good luck!|`|okpAjss6aa	aids
FoBLX9ceaa	i like lilli abella :) different and very pretty|`|dASDaT4Zaa	Lily Abella, definitely. (with the y spelling of Lily)<br>  My great-grandmother's name was Lillian Belle, it was so gorgeous and classy. I was named after her. :D<br>  My middle name is Belle. And I am going to name my future baby daughter Lily Belle, after her. It's timeless and beautiful, I love it!|`|7uznrLBXaa	Lillian, and call her Lilli/Lilly.  Keely sounds first like a dog's name, then like a boy's name.|`|2QPUs8lBaa	Lilly Abella is pretty.<br>  <br>  What about Kelsey Shea?|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Keely Shea.|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	Definitely Lilli Abella.|`|NjGeH0wKaa	NOT KEELY...<br>  Lillian Isabella|`|pO0s0bhHaa	Lilli Abella<br>  <br>  But I like the spelling Lilly better.<br>  <br>  Very pretty!|`|v5DaRgtKaa	lilli abella|`|B27oNdbNaa	How about<br>  <br>  Alie Baba O'Riley|`|1SDlh621aa	Keely is awful.

c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Yep, it's normal.  I used to wonder the same thing.  My daughter is 7 months and still eats every two hours....sometimes three, but mainly every two.  She doesn't eat at night though b/c she started sleeping through at 3 months.  <br>  <br>  She eats 6oz every two hours plus food 3x a day, but at 5 months she was eathing 6oz every two hours without food.  She's in the 25-50th percentile for her weight so I guess that's just normal for her - she sure doesn't mess around when it comes to eating! LOL<br>  <br>  Maybe you can talk with her pediatrician about introducing a little bit more food???  I dunno, just a suggestion.  I introduced food at 5.5 months b/c she was starting to eat every 1.5 hours!  Good luck girl!|`|OLW0Irbhaa	Some breastfed babies do feed that often.  You probably need to work with her at night as she may not need to eat but wants to out of habit.  Work on a strong bedtime routine so she learns what to expect.  If she wakes try seeing if she'll go back to sleep without being fed especially after you've gone to bed for the night.  Don't expect her to magically start doing this it will take time and a lot of patience!<br>  <br>  Why can't you pump and have your caregiver give her a bottle rather than run home every 2 hours?  I've had great success using the Playtex nurser with the latex nipple when my little one gets a bottle.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	You might want to try a pump...Then you can pump away and not have to drive home so often.  When I was pumping at work, I didn't make a LOT of milk, but it was enough to fill in the feedings my baby missed when I was working.  My workplace was very accomodating.  They had a lactation room with a small fridge & sink in it.  But at work, any empty space would work.  Don't make them go into the bathroom, though...that's gross!<br>  <br>  She's 5 months, so you can start trying some other foods.  It might be good to try something sort of filling.  I see you are using cereal.  How about some avocado, or mashed beans?  They both have protein and might keep her feeling full longer.  Oatmeal (regular, not the "baby cereal" kind) or grits might be a good idea, too.  :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|wphLaVs6aa	It's normal. And it will change with time. My son breastfed every two hours during the day until he was six months old and at night until he was nine months old. Breast milk digests in 90 minutes so it makes sense that she wants to feed frequently. Try not to give her too much cereal or pureed food at this age. Breast milk is the best thing for her. It has all the fats and nutrients she needs. <br>  <br>  I know it's exhausting and frustrating to have to breastfeed so frequently. Can you express some milk while you're at work so she can get a bottle sometimes and you can space apart your trips home?<br>  <br>  At night, do you cosleep at all? That might help you get more sleep. <br>  <br>  Try breast compressions to help your daughter get higher fat content in your milk. (go to KellyMom.com and search for breast compressions.)<br>  <br>  Frequent feeds are actually very healthy for your baby. I know it's not easy! It really does change and I bet it will sooner than you think!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Its normal if she is hungry she is hungry....why dont u pump so u dont have to keep coming home and try feeding her some cereal at night to...you could always switch her to formula and she will feed every 3 to 4 hours|`|6AvVVzsnaa	If she's hungry, let her have some. Better with breast milk every 2 hours than formula. It's normal.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	yay!! growth spurt.  those are tiring but usually only last for about a week or so.  just guessing, but that's exactly what mine does when he hits a spurt.  does nothing but eat and sleep for daaays.  if it's been longer than a week maybe it's not a growth spurt, maybe she's ready for more solid food.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	Yes that can be very normal for breastfed babies!! Mine still nurses every hour and a half to two hours|`|aS04NS0Qaa	babies need to eat every three hourse so i guess its only normal for this to happen.|`|CEMhkRxuaa	That is completley normal. ( I should know, my mum is a nurse who works in maternity).
41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Nope not at all.  If you have an epesiodomy and get sown back up your partner may enjoy that new tighter feeling though.  Don't worry about it (hard not to) everything goes back to normal, I promise!|`|Fy9S6hjIaa	Sex may be a little uncomfortable for the first couple months, but everything goes right back to normal pretty quickly.  So, it's not the actual delivery that ruins your sex life, it's all the sleep deprivation, midnight feedings and diaper changes, and lactating breasts that ruin your sex life lol!  No really, your sex life does kind of go down the tube after the baby is born, but it has nothing to do with a vaginal delivery, it has to do with the fact that your too exhausted to ever be in the mood, and when you are, the baby always wakes up just in time to ruin it.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	I would assume anything is possible... but very rare. Many women have vaginal births and enjoy se... buuuut I think having a baby can put a damper on your sex life... Many women feel they are tired, under appreciated, consumed with the baby... etc.. to want sex. Life does change after the baby and it is hard to want to "be in the mood" when your baby doesn't sleep and you are tired etc... but many women overcome this as well...|`|n8vBnA9Iaa	I delivered my 10.3 lbs son vaginally and it took awhile for the pain to go away but not 15 months later. Sex feels amazing, just like it did before I gave birth.|`|GLJkGgloaa	Being Pregnant ruins your sex life too.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	No, the body goes back to pretty much normal. It can take up to 2 years for a woman's body to go back though.  But sex will not feel any different than before the baby.  I have three children and I was cut with the first but nothing as far as feeling down there has changed.<br>  <br>  One big difference you will notice is that the baby will always notice when you and your husband get close to each other! LOL|`|wwiY3Zgjaa	of course it can. for most people it get back to normal in the end and some like it better but for some people yeah it's pretty much ruined for a long time. or at the very least I mean it can cause problems that can get worse and spiral and ruin the relationship and stuff|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	it shouldnt. and your vaginal walls are strechable. so a few months after giving birth you should be just the same way you were before you were pregnant. i gave birth about 3 months ago sex is still great for me. just that i dont get it as much. lol|`|Q2z5a4Xpaa	lol no but you can't have sex right after the birth|`|kwMuRDFjaa	Personally, No.|`|wunlQTOLaa	no|`|wl7tlYOYaa	no you pretty much go back to normal whether you tear or get cut they stitch you up you heal and everything goes back to normal unless you get postpardum depression but thats a whole different story.
tdHIR9cLaa	I agree with AMT i think you should give one the name Keshanna and the other Michelle... <br>  <br>  Middle names are easier to choose<br>  <br>  just go through you ABC's<br>  <br>  example:<br>  <br>  A- Ann<br>  B- Beth<br>  C- Clair<br>  D- Daisy, Dalila<br>  E- Ellie<br>  <br>  <br>  those are just examples but  you get the point. then you pick the one(s) you like<br>  GOOD LUCK|`|5a8r8laDaa	Regina|`|Cp06GyiQaa	why dont you call one keshanna and the other michelle otherwise the second child will think theyre not special and resent the other twin for having such a meaningful name.|`|fgEdiQx0aa	Aurelia Aurora<br>  Isabella <br>  Lula <br>  Artemis<br>  Vivienne <br>  Azalea<br>  Coraline (lol sorry, loved the movie)|`|8YzvLfh1aa	Emily or Kate. violet.  be nice if somehow you could tell me if you <br>  used one of my names. thanks
AA11952283	Nope,some even say it's better to try right after miscarriage because your open to everything.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Yes, your baby will be fine. Usually the doctor recommends waiting to conceive, but I think that is mostly to allow the mother to fully recover physically. If you are feeling okay, it's probably fine.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Not at all, early miscarriages (before 2nd trimester) are usually due to massive chromosomal defects - that happen to womens pregnancies of all ages, countries, ethnicities, etc...   1 in 3 women have a miscarriage in their lifetime, most go on to have normal pregnancies with normal kids (I am one, well maybe I am not that normal, but my sister and I came after our mother had two miscarriages).   It will be fine!|`|NPeKQBtTaa	No, it is said that falling pregnant soon after miscarriage can in some instances lead to another miscarriage but this is only in later pregnancy before the end of first trimester.<br>  <br>  I fell pregnant in the following cycle after early miscarriage, all is fine just got our first baby pics too cute!!!<br>  Good luck! Tonnes of baby dust to you|`|2sHpQjPYaa	I don't know the answer to this, but I do know that my sister-in law miscarried, and then got pregnant the first time she was allowed to have sex after the miscarriage, and that baby was born with Down Syndrome and a severe heart condition.  But that could just be a coincidence. I don't have any facts or stats to back that up!|`|wyNVJXUiaa	No!  My sis in law got pregnant right after her miscarriage and her now 5 year old girl is perfect.  Also - my best friend got pregnant right after her miscarriage (without even knowing she could be pregnant) and she now has a very healthy 3 year old son.
GDnJYq0Aaa	spank there bare butts and wash there mouth out with soap|`|Ioc0owmfaa	I am not sure how old are your kids. I assume they must be below 12.<br>  <br>  Environment affects the way kids behave. And it is not just physical environment but emotional environment and I can sense that they are currently in an emotional situation.<br>  <br>  I am sure you have done all you know about disciplining kids but it seems there are more to it.<br>  <br>  Could it be due to:<br>  <br>  1. the separation of their parents?<br>  2. the changes in their routine life?<br>  3. the less attention they received from both parents?<br>  4. the brain-washing of their perception of you?<br>  <br>  (I can be wrong, coz I am assuming as I don't know the real story)<br>  <br>  Basically, the kids are confused and don't really know how to adjust to this new situation as adults do. And the only way they know is to show tantrum.<br>  <br>  You need to talk to the kids with their father together, for the sake of the kids. Explain to them that both of you love them and they should listen to both parents.<br>  <br>  If the emotional part is not remedied at this stage, it will be harder as they grow older as the emotional baggage will be bigger and deeper.|`|h9Mq5NwMaa	I am very sorry but i will help as much as i can. <br>  - reward their good behavior as much as possible<br>  - relate to the girls as much you can<br>  -have a designated time-out area with timer. depending on how bad their actions were, set a time, and every time they fight back or escape reset the time until they finally behave.<br>  hope i helped<br>  also u can watch shows like nanny 911 and u can get some great tips.|`|M1yfrNgDaa	depends...how old are your girls....but if theyre at a younger age discipline them..."not by hitting or spanking" but simply by time outs,groundings,and a calm conversation telling them to settle down and say that when they yell and dont respect you ...your feelings get hurt. youll be surprised a lot of kids are compassionate for they're mommys and daddys when they want to be.|`|NjGeH0wKaa	You have to try and start disciplining them before it is tooooooo late.<br>  maybe you should have considered this BEFORE you became a single mother with 4 kids.<br>  <br>  not this advice sorry.
hVrfm4eIaa	I like the name Lincoln with Linc as a nickname.  If you really don't like it though he should respect that.  There are so many names out there, you should be able to find one that you both like.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I would go with Lincoln and NN link love it|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I like the 3rd suggestion, lincoln and nickname link or you could use link as the middle name.|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	I love the Legend of Zelda games, but seriously, that's not an appropriate name for a baby.  All I can hear in my head is that System of a Down song, "Link, he comes to town, comes to save the Princess Zelda..."<br>  <br>  It has a nice SOUND to it, but really, you need him to take a bit more mature approach to naming your child.  Maybe Link as a middle name?|`|FoBLX9ceaa	tell him you him the truth, that you do not wish to go through life shouting link all the time, this is your baby too you definitly have say, perhaps offer to name a pet that...good luck|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Tell him it's a great nickname, but that you'd like to give your son a name that will be easier to carry.|`|brVS3Pg0aa	you really shouldnt name your kid that, that wouldnt be very kind. i cant even tell if thats a boy or girls name, sorry.. Just calmly suggest similiar names like larson, larkson, larry, lance, landon, lenny, <br>  if its for a girl..<br>  lily, lynda, lydia, lisa, laura, lynn or larissa|`|IFTeZhKHaa	No. It's stupid naming your son after a  ifyouseekay.ing game character. Seriously, do not do it. That will me the worst mistake in your life.|`|NroZQN5vaa	Why not name him Lincoln and call him Link? Lincoln is a good name and it sounds like a full name but you can call him Link. BTW, I love the legend of Zelda! Ocarina of time was AWESOME!|`|OiFNZnwOaa	you could compromise and call him lincoln that way your husband can call him link :-)<br>  i dont particularly like it, kinda reminds me of a metal chain link :-)|`|oHNrktxTaa	No, sorry, I don't like it either:(<br>  <br>  Just sit down & talk to your husband & tell him. Pick a name that you both agree on.|`|a7xhpJZiaa	Lincoln<br>  Lync|`|LmlIzdwsaa	yea sorry i dont like the name Link at all !|`|fWmhJa86aa	how about it be his nick name|`|vcCbuVncaa	I would compromise and make it the middle name. That way it is still there but you can give him a first name you both like. Just tell him you have some other names you like and it can be the middle name. Then agree on a first name. That way you can call him by the first name and Link can be his 'Daddy Nickname'. My older brother's wife wanted to name their baby Ivy and my brother didn't like it so they agreed on Hannah Ivy and they are both happy!!|`|pO0s0bhHaa	Have you considered a more formal name like Lincoln and then as a nickname your husband can call him "Linc". <br>  <br>  I'm assuming Link is a male name?   I don't know what Zelda is. <br>  <br>  Good luck.  It's always hard to try to convince our husbands that we know better!  ;-)|`|YvNOfM2xaa	TO compromise make the name Laura of some L name and have her nickname be link? Or he can call her that.<br>  <br>  Just come up with a list if names and see if any interesting names that he likes  better! ? Then you don't have to tell him!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Yeah, I don't really think it's "appropriate" either. It can always be a nickname or even a middle name if it's really that special to you. What about something like Zane?|`|P37lIBr2aa	name him Linkon and he can call him Link for short. My SIL just had a baby boy and they named him Linkon John and call him Link as a nickname.|`|9iOxl6epaa	LINK? poor kid. :/ just tell your husband that you think its stupid to name your kid after a video game. use a favorite football players name. thats wayyyy better than a video game character|`|ziPhihHNaa	say this "honey i like the name link but i would perfer something else" say it sweetly and nicely with puppy eyes|`|ZA3N1wE4aa	No, I don't. <br>  <br>  Just tell him "sorry, but no."|`|91I5u8F9aa	Link was also the name of Brendan Frasier on Encino Man.......he was a cave man..|`|okpAjss6aa	i don't think so|`|XdgkK76iaa	Tell him honey link doesn't sound right to me. How about George or Jordan or Matthew?|`|kWMjY8yLaa	Link ? wtf are you stupid?!
AWCbp3Yeaa	I had the same problem with my boyfriend. The anxiety was outrageous and I cried a lot. He didn't understand either. There isn't a way to put him in your shoes-not even for a moment. But explain to him how your hormones change after you have a baby and that this is completely normal. It can't be fixed overnight-tell him to be a little more supportive because it's not something you can change. Explain to him that it will ease up on its own and you will get better if he gives it some time. Its not something you need to feel bad for. This happens to most women after pregnancy.|`|OGBP5umTaa	buy him a book about it
AA11952283	I doubt it,it would be to early for your horomones to be out of wack just yet.Although they are at there highest peak during early pregnancy.|`|S5n5Za78aa	no you just need some more DIK  <br>  ha ha ha ha lmao|`|OiFNZnwOaa	no not unless you have been relieving your horniness with unprotected sex...you could just be very hormonal :-)|`|ZcAzvwFWaa	lolololololololololololololololololololo...<br>  <br>  LOL.|`|l2A2kCIPaa	its a natural thing hun :)<br>  enjoy it
wphLaVs6aa	I've read about "breath-holding spells" in toddlers. It's terrifying for parents but harmless to the child. (A trip to the doctor is still a good idea, of course!) It's apparently even harmless if the child faints and has  what appears to be a seizure. I can't imagine that! How frightening!!!<br>   <br>  Google "breath-holding spells toddlers" and you will find articles about this. The good news is that it seems to be normal and your child will grow out of it in time.|`|cO10vvWsaa	This aren't seizures, don't worry about it. Some babies cry so hard and have a pause spell where their mouths are wide open without breathing and they can pass out or get purple. My little brother used to do this when he was a baby and he would almost pass out. he is fine he is now 13 years old and he has no disorders or anything.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	It is actually very  common for children to hold their breath as a part of a temper tantrum, it is one of the few things they have control over, but saying that i would still seek medical opinion before i wrote it off as a temper tantrum. Don't leave things like this to chance it is always better to be safe than sorry!!!|`|HGqmsaM5aa	Honestly no! I wouldn't let him out of my sight in case this happens while your sleeping or something and happen to not be there to help him if you need it! I would have personally taken him to the hospital , but if your waiting until the morning keep an eye on him!|`|u5cwRJ0Paa	My niece used to get herself so upset that sometimes when she would cry she also would do a big cry, then inhale, and then it would seem like an eternity until she cried again, and a couple of times she wouldn't and passed out.  My sister also freaked but there wasn't anything she could do about it.<br>  See what the doctor says, and if need be get a second opinion, but it could just be that you have a very strong willed child on your hands so good luck.|`|nHsgRlXGaa	my daughter did the same thing at four months... after vaccines.  She got REALLY upset with the injections, wailed her way through discharge and into the car, and then when i took her out (about 5 minutes later) she passed out.  was immobile, unable to respond to my "what i thought harsh" beating on her back... at which point i brought her directly into the doctors again... they rushed her to the back... observed her, and she came around.  They said it was a something something syncopee (spelling?) and that it could happen easily if she were really worked up.  What they said to do in the future was hold cold compresses to her head if she were to wail like that again and to bring her back if any discoloration were to happen.  Luckily it never happened again, and now i have to sit in the waiting room for 45 min after each injection......  good luck and definitely have it looked at... perhaps even tonight.|`|QvmHjhdsaa	Eons ago my mother worked for a doctor and this mom would come in all upset because her son would hold his breath until he passed out. She was of course freaking out. (I think we all would) Anyway I cant tell you how many times my mom has shared the docs advice with us. He told her to let him hold his breath (he was doing it because he was mad or didnt get what he wanted and of course this got a huge reaction out of mom and gave him the attention he wanted) She was floored when he said go ahead and let him do it and when she asked why it was ok he said well as soon as he passes out he starts breathing again. Of course your situation sounds different since you have to pat him to get him to breathe again. I think the dr is the best advice. I just had to share my story.  as I have heard it from my mom for ohhhhhhh 25-30 years now lol|`|uCnmYEPBaa	My father use to hold his breath as a child when he felt like his mom wasn't doing what he wanted. Her theory is that when he passes out, his system automatically starts breathing again.<br>  Just cushion his fall so he doesn't get hurt.<br>  When he does it again, just observe. He will most likely start breathing on his own, if he doesn't then go to the ER.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	WOW i am glad you are talking him in scary !! all i can think of is a seize disorder I am sure they will run tests .

The only advantages to this one is that it can be used longer, my niece used to sit in my daughters when she was 2. It also converts into a booster seat. Personally I liked this one better than I liked the regular bumbo's|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Bath seats (not bath tubs) particularly the bath rings with suction cups could work on hardwood.<br>  <br>  I used a portable high chair (first years, they don't make the ones I have any more though they make similar ones) though admittedly these can get tipped over more, I wouldn't leave a baby unattended in one, particularly around a toddler (mind are 20 months apart)<br>  <br>  Laundry baskets can work.  Rubbermaids tubs (also make good indoor swimming pools if they have high enough sides)<br>  <br>  Jolly jumpers (but then the toddler pushes him around -D'oh)<br>  <br>  I have a hiking backpack, sometimes I'd use that on the floor.  It works pretty well, a bit big though (It has a leg to keep it propped)<br>  <br>  Also I have a strap from a "cart cover" which you can use to seat belt a child into some smaller chairs particularly ones with arms that aren't high off the ground.  Any fabric store can help you make one its just a nylon strap with an adjuster to make it bigger or smaller and a clip.<br>  <br>  (PS Obviously if you are using a portable high chair which is meant to be strapped to a chair, or a bath seat that is meant to be used in a situation where mom can't walk away then obviously you have to make sure its safe and won't tip over.

1SGl03Zlaa	Are you paying the full amount of what is left owing on the existing mortgage?  If not you will need to go to the bank and apply for a mortgage to take over payments.  Once you are approved for a mortgage you will need to hire a lawyer to have the deed changed into your name and go through the proper steps with the bank.  Changing the house into your name is no different than if you purchased the house from anyone else except you don't need a real estate agent.|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	You need an attorney.

S5n5Za78aa	take some time off  if both him and you are ready to start a family talk to him let him know how your feeling<br>  <br>  EDIT: JUST EXTRA INFO <br>  you should look into the book (taking charge of your fertility) you can prob get it from library and start charting your temps  on fertilityfriend.com but the book will teach you everything as far as pinpointing ovulation<br>  or you can wait for ovulation which can occur anywhere from 10-24 days after the first day of you period (fertile period ) its different for everyone and start using ovulation predictor kits till you get a positive between the days i just mentioned and go from there  but you have to make sure whatever you do your having sex on the RIGHT days it can get tricky!! good luck|`|tQPvv0Glaa	Have sex with him while he's sleeping =)|`|6r5obUfiaa	I know how u feel. Im in the same situation. What i did is, i spoke to my husband about how i felt. Come on, after all when it comes to making love....no men will feel tired and when they are...the tiredness just fly off. Thats what i told my hubby.<br>  <br>  I also told him how much i want to be a mom. And we came to a conclusion. We have it every weekend, when he is off (my hubby travels and only be back on weekend).<br>  <br>  And when, he is travelling on weekday and im ovulating that time....i cant do anything bout it. But when the next mth when he is back, i catch hold of him for the entire fertile period :)<br>  <br>  There is some give and take in here. Well for me, i understand my hubby's busy schedule and give in a bit and he understand of my desire to be a mom and he gives in a bit.<br>  <br>  So, try this way. Talk n make him understand and come to a reasonable conclusion that both parties agrees.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	The best way to get prego is to go to the store; go to the spaghetti isle and pick up the prego brand of sauce.

AA12152120	This question does not have an answer. There are endless possibilities ei. health care, food, childcare costs, you still have to pay all your normal bills, rent, utilities, diapers, bath needs, if i added all the costs, each month, for ONE of my kids, everything together would end up costing about $2000. And that is if you are not eligible to get any state assistance. And depending on your age, and maturity level,whether you are working, living on your own, etc....Do you have a car? insurance? A kid takes alot of care, and if you are asking this question, I would say wait on having one!|`|M2yERqNSaa	from birth to 18, right now stands at 180k|`|AMiQ1dlgaa	just let the govmint pay 4 them that what i dose|`|j0y4xObcaa	allot new Born's alone can cost thousands you need nappies, food, clothes, nursery furniture and not forgetting and medicines, prams, more clothes because they grow so quick|`|NjGeH0wKaa	if you're asking this question you probably shouldn't become a parent.
MRyv5E5waa	Well I had it for 5 years and never used anything so yeah I think it is ok but I would call and make sure. You could also google Mirana information and facts!|`|52U22fiAaa	Yeah, it's OK.  The Mirena works immediately and it 99% effective (accroding to Mirena).|`|NroZQN5vaa	You don't have to use condoms. It starts working right away. Just be sure that you check your strings so that you know it's still in place and you can pretty much do whatever with very little chance of getting pregnant. Just keep an eye out for signs that it needs to come out.|`|G766dQjtaa	Yes, you can. I did a little research on them b/c im getting mine in like 7 weeks and it works right away so you don't have to use condoms. You should still ask your ob just to be sure there is nothing you need to check for like the strings etc.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	Yes he can *** in you.  I had the Mirana put in and gained a ton of weight so I took mine out.  You should periodically  check to make sure the string is still in the right place so that you know that your IUC is still in the right place.|`|XrKviWgSaa	i would call in the morning to ask, i plan on getting put in that when i have my daughter.|`|LcxgPUjCaa	yes you will get fat my friend did not cool|`|AT6E6sqQaa	If you don't have to use condoms then yes it is ok. When they tell you to use condoms for the first month it is to let the hormones begin to kick in so that you will not get pregnant. Since you have an IUD (intrauterine device) it may use hormones, but it is a 'physical barrier'. It's like a long-term condom. So go for it!
Ah9nRiidaa	I would just wait and see if you start your period on time because it's so close to call cause early pregnancy and PMS are almost the same symptoms.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	It is probably the hormones from the pills leaving your body.  You could probably take a early detection pregnancy test and find out.  If it is negative retest in a week and those results will be accurate.<br>  <br>  Some factors would increase your chances like unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck on which ever way you want this to go!|`|WbsdtLgFaa	it could be, or it could be your body trying to regulate your periods on its own. You'll just have to wait until your late to test|`|9jbifeYcaa	It could just be that your body is ready to take its next peroid.  If you havent missed the pill it is unlikely that you are pregnant.  When i am due to start my peroid i can get a swollen stomach and chest... plus my chest is sore, for about a week before hand.  I wouldnt worry too much if i was you.|`|jNXND8X3aa	I get sore nipples and bloat before getting my period!

Apparently she had somekind of experience with dog poop that day|`|umGi6gTcaa	maybe she's trying to get you to tell her that you're trying because she secretly knows, or maybe it's her grandma clock ticking away.<br>  <br>  Do you eat healthy? maybe that's why she's dreaming about you eating unhealthy crap .<br>  <br>  Dreams are just desires, memories, fears and stuff from our lives. Did you pig out on some fast food or something she thinks is gross the night before her dream?|`|PFJ7ZbVZaa	Hmmm that is weird (and gross! lol)  But I had a friend of mine tell me that in her culture, if you dreamt of poop that meant that money was headed your way.  And sometimes, if someone dreams that someone is pregnant, that it might mean that a friend of yours is going to get pregnant.  (This is what my friend told me).  Good luck trying to conceive!  I wish you the best of luck!  And I hope that your mom doesn't have any more weird dreams! lol|`|tcHkn0VIaa	there is an eating disorder called pica- i do not know much about it but you can look it up. it is where pregnant women crave strange things like sand that could be harmful to your health and your baby. Not saying there is anything to the dream but it is interesting.|`|jNXND8X3aa	look into a dream dictionary.|`|mLbydsVIaa	woa lol thats really weird.<br>  maybe youll get pregnant or maybe u already are...and will crave something gross...but hopefully not the dog crap!! lol<br>  weird.

ebQJsYTxaa	Did you mean your daughter is 1 year old?<br>  <br>  Keep researching.  Don't give more vaccines until you are comfortable doing so.  After researching for awhile, you'll either be more comfortable with vaccinating than not, or the other way around.  There's no huge rush.<br>  <br>  I did my research before I got pregnant for the first time.  I chose not to vaccinate at all, and I'm very happy with that decision.  My kids are 5 years and 20 months, and very healthy.  One child has had pertussis (whooping cough), and both have had chickenpox.  Not once during the illnesses did I wish they had been vaccinated.<br>  <br>  The illnesses that are vaccinated for are either extremely rare, or not a huge deal.  After researching, I decided that vaccinating was a lot riskier than not vaccinating.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Whatever side effects she may get from the vaccines are nothing compared to the painful death those vaccines help prevent.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I chose to delay and will give one shot at a time when we start at 12 months. I have a slew of reasons behind it but chose to take the middle ground.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I am going along with all the recommended vaccinations with my (almost) 5 month old daughter and did the same with my 6 year old son. <br>  <br>  A recent episode of "The Doctors" had a big segment about vaccinations and there was quite a debate. The autism connection is a very popular debate in itself. You don't HAVE to vaccinate..there are parents who refuse to and some who actually are recommended not to if previous children had bad reactions. I would say use your instinct and weigh the pros and cons.<br>  <br>  And remember...it's alot easier to find the information on things that you expect to see. Example...the Mirena IUD. My sister researched it and decided to get it but after 6 months of severe side effects and health problems got it removed. Once she researched the negatives she found a crap load of bad input about it. Everyone thinks its a great method of birth control so she didn't expect anything bad from it. The opposite goes to the vaccinations...it's such a hot topic right now that you're going to find more negative than positive info.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	try doing a delayed schedule for the remainder of her vaccinations.<br>  <br>  many pediatricians say that giving a baby a dozen vaccines (in combo shots) doesn't increase the rate of side effects, etc, BUT if you read the info fliers from the manufacturers that the doctors hand out many of them say that it DOES! <br>  <br>  even vetrinarians will spread out a pet's vaccinations for safety, why won't a pediatrician?!? if there's a reaction, how do you know which vaccine did it?!?|`|qxnZXOVFaa	vaccinate...all of those sites out there are trying to scare you.  that's why they have all the scary stories on them.  in reality, those cases in which something bad happened was caused by an underlying problem the child already had.  make sure you have a good pediatrician and get your child's immunizations.  children without their vaccines have actually caused recent outbreaks of viruses that have been dormant for years.|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	Please, please, please make sure that you get her all of the recommended vaccines. You risk endangering other children when herd immunity is lost from children not being vaccinated.<br>  <br>  That said, if you are uncomfortable with the alleged risks, talk to your pediatrician about your concerns! Ask if it's possible to stagger the vaccines so that your daughter isn't getting a cocktail of many drugs at once.|`|f98brCdxaa	i got chicken pox when i was 2 weeks old and my mom still got me the vaccination. Its very rare that a child will have any sort of reaction to the vaccinations. its better to have them vaccinated then have them get sick. Good luck!
La49JNrAaa	Well, from what you have said, it sounds like a strong possibility. Sometimes stress can throw off your cycle, like you said, and i have been so stressed before that I made myself sick, but this sounds different. I would take another test, and go see a doctor. You could be pregnant, or like someone else said, it could be something else. <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10015577	If you are, you could be one of the few that have a menstrual while pregnant.  If the positive line was there, it indicates pregnancy, but it could have resulted that way even if you had a miscarriage.  Your best bet is to see a doctor and get a blood test, they can tell you if you ARE pregnant or miscarried.  Good luck hun.|`|8PkEkTcZaa	sounds like to me you are|`|HFWLYMD6aa	You sound like you could be pregnant. def do another test. Use first morning urine. Good Luck.|`|Og09Q7ylaa	It sounds like there is a strong possibility based on what you have described. If you are pregnant, you are far enough along that you may have symptoms. The best thing to do would be to take another (reliable) test and then you will have your answer. I would be less worried about the sickness and tiredness and more worried about the change in your cycle. Best of luck!|`|XRbHcGuLaa	With strange bleeding and some pregnancy-like symptoms this could be anything, such as a cyst on your ovary that can cause pregnancy like symptoms and interrupt your period.  The disappearing positive was probably what is called an "evaporation line."  I think it is important to see a doctor for an exam and to find out if you are pregnant for sure or if there's something going on with you.|`|5wTbpAucaa	it sort of does there is a possibility but bodies can change so maybe your cycle is just changing you werent really late with your period rite? cuz thats like a given  if you were late|`|ZDpprktbaa	that's one hell of an irregular period i would say. and yea it def does sound like ur preg hun. and if ur so worried about it u should have spent the money on a good preg test got ur answer and then been done with it instead of going threw all this all these months. that way ( if you aren't against it) you could of had a abortion but idk how long is too late to get one. sooo yea good luck with everything.|`|rSXZOU5zaa	When i was pregnant, i missed my period all together. Everything else sounds like you are, though. And if the test said you were, even if it was a cheap one, you more than likely are. Its best to take them in the morning. . . so try that. I was always hungry too and when i would try to eat i would just get sick to my stomach. <br>  good luck.
AA10503925	Go to the dr with her and get a paternity test.|`|2zC1lpfVaa	You can have a DNA test once the baby is born.  Test done before that may be too risky for the baby.<br>  <br>  Probably the girl is telling you the truth, and the baby is not yours.  Or she doesn't want you to be part of her life anymore.  You cannot force her to accept you, and specially since you are 2 not married.
ByoYmFsBaa	Yep, pretty amazing.<br>  I saw her address this in an interview, and she said she saved every dollar she made and put it aside for her in-vitros.<br>  <br>  I know someone right this moment (I wouldn't claim her as a close friend) who is on state aid, filing bankruptcy next month -- and just bought a new car yesterday.

It is not a covered benefit.  <br>  <br>  She is also not required to care about your questions.|`|IeYdlAOtaa	There is alot of questions that are or will go unanswered. There really isn't any clear answers coming from the father,mother, doctor, or Nadya. In alot of cases no one really needs to know how, what, where, but this is one time as tax payers, get the answers so ways are found for those children to be taken out of harms way to live a good life. She has no way to take care of the six at different ages now, plus the soon to be 8 more over time in a house that the 6 children, mother, grandmother were living in. Just by what has been reported and the interviews on the different TV stations, this young lady has no way to take care of 14 children. She wants to avoid answering anyone by indicating other women have had more children than what they were ready for, and because she is single these problems with the public are taking place. If anyone can get some type of answers, it will be Dr.Phil. Like Dr. Phil. has said, it's best that children stay with their parents and not be put in the foster system, but these poor little babies don't have or will have a normal life, there is no room right now for them in that house.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Masculine.  Cute for a little boy, grows well into manhood.  Classic but sounds good in the modern day, and not overused.

TdF6QLawaa	It seems that there is a lot of conflicting opinions on the subject. This was always going to happen when people talk emotive subjects like abortion.<br>  <br>  A teenage girl CANNOT be forced to abort her baby unless the child is considered infirm/unsound of mind or unable to understand her predicament and then she will be supplied with an advocate to mediate for her if the mother decides to argue the case.<br>  <br>  And I think that many people on here have jumped to serious conclusions about the asker!

I belive it involves a court case and the like though.|`|ScHW4842aa	no sorry - australian above - your friend was forced not legally by her mother to have the abortion. she just gave in .<br>  <br>  no one can force legally an underage person to have an abortion. <br>  anywhere in us, or australia.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	Legally, an underage girl has just as many rights regarding her pregnancy as an adult. No one can force anyone else to abort, adopt out, or keep a baby if they don't want to. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jlc.org/factsheets/27/#10" rel="nofollow">http://www.jlc.org/factsheets/27/#10</a>|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	No.  A parent can not force a child to have any medical procedure that is not necessary.  A minor still needs their parents consent for dental work, but while pregnant they make their own decisions regarding their medical care.  It is illegal for anyone to force abortion upon you.<br>  <br>  I am sure you can Google the laws, I do not have the source but I know that it is a fact.|`|TadINnYoaa	You have no right to even be considering that.

You'd be better off having a rational conversation with her about what's involved and letting her know you will support her no matter what she decides. Also I'd recommend taking her to parenting classes so she can can deal with everything and make friends with other new mums, as a teenager she'll feel lonely and isolated otherwise. Ask your doctor to provide info of the help and education she can get.|`|575w52loaa	NO!! absolutely NOT!  A mother cannot make her child have an abortion...there are laws but basically being pregnant emanciapates the minor... if a mother takes her daughter to a clinic and tries to force an abortion on her all the girl would have to do is say she didn't want it, they will not force her...It IS against the Law...!|`|uTl0W2hraa	no it is illegal for a mother to make her underage child recieve an abortion <br>  it is the body of the teenager and there for it is their decidsion<br>  hope i helped u|`|4T3YHHHZaa	beat ur kids *** i would **** i dont know wat were gonna do with these kids she probably has sex to damn poppin them out in middle school show her whos the boss|`|jVNlMeVfaa	No.|`|113FoyMFaa	no she cant

AA11481889	NO it is NOT AN EXCUSE to be a slacker.<br>  <br>  I was unloading crates and crates of reams of paper and walking two blocks to the FedEx box in heels when I was 8 months pregnant.<br>  <br>  Pregnancy is not an illness or a handicap....it's a temporary condition.<br>  <br>  I'm happy that my employer tolerated my need to go to the doctor every week (complicated pregnancy).  I wouldn't expect him to allow me to lessen my work load ESPECIALLY right before a 3 to 4 month leave of absence.<br>  <br>  TONS of women use pregnancy as an excuse for lots of things...and I think it's ridiculous.<br>  <br>  So you're pregnant...so what...that doesn't mean you get to eat 6 gallons of ice cream, it doesn't mean you get to be a megabitch for 9 months, it doesn't mean you get to slack off on the job...pregnancy doesn't entitle anyone to anything other than having a baby.<br>  <br>  It's great to have an understanding employer....but it's not a requirement for them to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  For me the biggest issue is honesty. <br>  <br>  It bugs me to NO END when someone is just being a whiner...<br>  <br>  Whether it's because of pregnancy or the flu or a friggin hang nail...whatever.  If someone is REALLY ill, or is REALLY having a hard time with something...then I can totally empathize.<br>  <br>  If someone is using pregnancy, or the flu, or whatever other condition they are exploiting, as an excuse to be a whiner or to take advantage...then that's when I drop the hammer.<br>  <br>  We're all here to do a job...period...regardless of our conditions....as long as someone is actually putting forth their BEST EFFORT, I an be understanding...it's when they're giving less than their best and expecting 100% back from the company that I'm not ok with.|`|qayCggxMaa	Our government requires employers to treat pregnant employees the same as any other employee with a temporary disability (see the Pregnancy Discrimination Act).  "It is illegal for an employer to use pregnancy as a reason to take any adverse personnel action that would not have been undertaken otherwise, including lay-off, reduced responsibilities or reduced pay."<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say it's exactly special treatment, but you can't treat women like their life is over just because they are pregnant and you can't treat them as if they can't do their job just because they have a baby.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I believe its an excuse for a little bit of special treatment.  I work at an apartment complex and when I was nearing the end of my pregnancy, my coworkers would help me out by doing Walk Through Inspections and stuff like that.  I would normally do them, but they didn't mind helping out.<br>  <br>  None should be allowed to come into work and do nothing <br>  just because they are pregnant.|`|vpmRRamKaa	i think that when your nearing the end of your pregnancy then you should have just alittle more excuses then the other workers, but i wouldnt know because i have no children because im only 13, but my mom does have 4 and im the second oldest, so when she was nearing her higher months [7-9monts]  she needed more help. so me and my eldest sister helped out and stuff, and girls come to my school pregnant alot|`|f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	It probably depends on what kind of work she's doing. If reasonable accommodations can be made to allow her to keep working, then by all means, those accommodations should be made and she should keep her job. However, if the pregnancy prevents her from doing her job, then I see no reason why the company should be forced to pay her for a job that she can't even do. That would be a real and significant burden on the company. Corporations aren't welfare agencies, nor should they be.<br>  <br>  I don't know what the law says about maternity leave, and it obviously matters what the law says. Personally, I think it's best if the mother stays home with the newborn for a long time anyway, and mothers who can't afford that should probably postpone having babies until they can.|`|xRpZ9nmfaa	it depends.because of corse a pregnant woman neeeds different things from the work place.an example would be a woman working where she stands in an assembly line all day would probably need to be moved to a different area of the building at least during the pregnancy.put her somwhere where there is less standing.and its wrong for an employer to fire someone because they are pregnant, thats when she needs her job the most.but if they are firing her under other circumstances such as not doing her job then its fair.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I know for me, my job requires a lot of heavy lifting, pushing, pulling, etc and when I was pregnant I just couldn't do as much as I used to.  Did I take advantage of that, no... but there are many who do.  It also has a lot to do with leadership LETTING them get away with it.|`|M2yERqNSaa	NO, millions of women are pregnant everyday, there are some in the fields in africa or columbia who have their babies in fields and go back to work.<br>  <br>  being pregnant is not like the second coming of christ, it happens everyday|`|iwUInpC1aa	No. <br>  <br>  Being pregnant is your choice it should have no effect in your work. <br>  <br>  There is No excuse for time off either. <br>  <br>  You are in charge of your life - If you are working, don't get pregnant or put up with the consequences that come with it.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I really think that reasonable accomodations could have been made.|`|ZA5QTj3Zaa	I wouldn't say special treatment.  But some activities will need to be eliminated like heavy lifting or being in contact with strong fumes.<br>  <br>  Although if the women is having difficulties she may have to leave for hospital in short notice and I don't think that should affect her job.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  See now morning sickness is kind of a good reason as long she communicated to her boss that she would be late and why.  The boss should have talked to her if he wasn't happy about it, maybe he did I don't know.  <br>  <br>  Because I went to work once and had a stomach flu and was running to the washroom every 20 minutes.  Even though I was at work, you think I got any work done?<br>  <br>  I would still go to work if I had morning sickness but if it was REALLY bad one morning I would ask to come in later.  Beats having to brush my teeth every 20 minutes at work or going the whole day with puke breath.|`|tj0X2YaYaa	I know this was asked a while ago, but I still wanted to answer. I have mixed feelings about this.  I don't think it's any excuse for special treatment when it comes to normal things that come with pregnancy, like morning sickness.  You knew when you got pregnant that you were going to have to deal with it and you should have made plans accordingly.  Plans that didn't include just calling in sick once a week because you didn't feel good.  I do think that they should make some special allowances if there are complications with the pregnancy that the woman and dr are trying to figure out but the dr hasn't put her on bedrest for.  In that case, yes you knew there was a chance of complication, but since it only happens to a small percentage of pregnant women you didn't assume that you'd be in the small percentage.  If there are complications then I believe they should give the woman a certain amount of time to figure out how to deal with the job and the complications and if she can't figure it out in that amount of time then they need to let her go.  I understand that being pregnant and working is hard.  And I understand how hard complications can be while working because I've been having complications since I was 20 weeks.  It has only effected my work in that I've had to go to dr's appointments because whether I felt good or not I've been to work every day.  But it has hit the point where I don't feel I can come to work every day, and so I've talked with my manager and I will be going on maternity leave in two weeks.  I know that nobody wants to have to do things like go on maternity leave early or come in while feeling like you'd rather be at home, but pregnancy is a choice and you shouldn't make your company suffer for it.|`|p1sB578jaa	a little bit. we are carrying a life. only the female sex can do this within the human race<br>  <br>  you may not know all the details. it's her right not to disclose all of her ailments.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I don't think it's an excuse for special treatment but it also depends on the type of work you do.  I do a lot of heavy lifting and couldn't do a lot of things that I normally do when I was pregnant.  I felt bad about it though, I didn't take advantage of it.  I think this is the main reason my doctor put me out on disability so early during my pregnancies.  (That, and I was also high risk due to a clotting disorder.)  Every woman is different, every job is different, and every pregnancy is different.<br>  <br>  ETA:  You're right on that one, it's so debatable.  I had to do that a few times during my 2nd pregnancy but just coded the time off as vacation time so that I never had to cross that bridge....|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no, i don't think anybody deserves special treatment for any condition, including pregnancy, but compassion is always nice.<br>  however, i think it's kind of silly of her to try to sue. lots of ppl get fired from their jobs all the time, with the way this economy is.<br>  and to the person who said "it happens all the time to everyone, not the 2nd coming of christ" yeah we know that, but to each woman their baby is special. sorry but you didnt really mske a valid point. and thank god this isn't colombia so we don't have to endure that.
z6IekuwSaa	I coached both Jr high and High School Cheerleading. I always looked for potential at the Jr High level and then precision at the High School level. In the Jr High level I looked for how well they retained the information and how spirited they were during the try out. A lot of times I cut girls because they got to nervous and let that show to much, but kept other girls who made up motions (like during the dance especially) and didn't show that they made a mistake. Tell her that if she forgets a motion, hit any motion, just make it look sharp and pretend it was the right one. Don't let the judges or coach know it was the wrong one. But most of all try to not let her get nervous and have a blast with it instead!|`|hUbNKOTsaa	well she should be able to do all the moves they have taught her in the four days, loudness, cheerfulness are also things they will be looking for. that is probably about it|`|fb8eDg4Naa	Being supportive (and corrective at times) in every decision she makes is the only true way to encourage her and help her out.  Her being new may very well lead to her not making the squad, but it could also lead to greater opportunities, like friendship, as you said.  Also, if she does not make the cheer-leading squad, have her look into joining a color guard.  Color guards show needs for charisma and rhythm, similar to cheer-leading.  Color guards are often very underrated at some schools, but the activity is considered much more demanding and much more rewarding than cheer-leading.  I am in an indoor drumline, and I know many members of my school's indoor color guard; some of them were girls that didn't make the cheer-leading squad.  They claim is it more rewarding in the sense that they are working for themselves; the activity is independent because they are the main event (they do not just tag along for a sports team).  <br>  <br>  So no matter what happens, the only tips you can give her are to stay strong, be true to herself, and to try her best, which apply to ANY situation, not just trying out for a cheer-leading squad.|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	They will look for her personality to shine through which sounds hypocritical because they are all doing the same cheer and routine but you can just tell when someone out there is having fun.  You are right about the positive attitude and facial expressions.  Getting the dance and cheer down are important as well.  Also let her know if she makes a mistake to keep going because they look at that also.  No one is perfect all the time but it is how you pick yourself up and move on that is important.<br>  <br>  Just let her know that not all girls can make the team but that there is always next year and as long as she does her best then that is all she can do.  Also if she doesn't make it to help her deal with the disappointment maybe enroll her in a dance, chear or gymnastics class to help her prepare for next year or let her pick another activity of her choice.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Be Peppy and excited. She is going to be a CHEER leader,she will need to get the crowd excited about the games. So just being loud and precise isn't everything,I think judges also want someone of good character,a good role model for classmates.|`|8e373a7bc6b3c784f2bae9cc02a6cf20aa	Well, she needs to be able to do the routine.  Besides that, enthusiasm, energy and smile, smile, smile!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	She doesn't have to be a pro to make the team. What alot of coaches look for is potential, outgoing-ness, commitment. Everything else can be learned, as long as she is dedicted and commited to learning. As long as she is confident and tries her best, she will do fine. I coach middle school volleyball, and we have the same philosphy, as long as you are commited, we can teach you. She has some experience, which is a plus, and plus, its middle school, they dont expect her to be a skilled expert, not yet anyway :)|`|4RAboDSDaa	Sharpness, loudness, and facials are very important. Also focus on tumbling: she should do a round-off if she has one...that's what got me on the squad in middle school. If she has a flip-flop (back handspring), even better! Round-off flip-flop back tucks are probably the best to do at a tryout if she has one. Make sure she DOES NOT do anything that she isn't absoultely sure she can do. She could get seriously hurt. Make sure it is practiced. <br>  <br>  Jumps are also key on a cheer squad. Make sure at the tryout, if the girls can choose what kind of jumps they can do, help her choose the one(s) that she can do best. <br>  <br>  Make sure she knows that if she doesn't make it this year, to try out next year because cheerleading can be really fun! Good luck!!|`|AA12305061	I've tried out twice and been unsuccessful.

80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	I've been using a prenatal you can just get at WalMart called OneSource Prenatals and they have been working wonderfully. You have to take two pills but they give you an extra few percentages in the vitamins, to help mommy get that much closer to a perfectly balanced daily intake. They only cost me around five dollars, and I get 144 pills in a bottle, which amounts to 71 days. That's two and a half months worth of vitamins.<br>  <br>  Also, with them every day I take Expecta, which is a pill that actually has a small amount of sugar made into the plastic coating, making it much easier to settle on the belly and it doesn't take bad while it's waiting for you to get some water. My doctor tells me she has every woman who enters her clinic take these. They have the basic Omega's that your baby will need for brain and eye development. :)<br>  <br>  Hope all that helped! And congratulations!|`|cnK4X2sZaa	as long as your getting what you need....folic acids and of course iron and all the others, you are fine. you dont need to take an extra folic acid supplement. the reason you have to eat with them is cause of the amount of vitamins and minerals you are putting into your body at once. they i take materna... and they are pretty big. i also used to take Jamison's prenatal.. it's all the same.|`|vdXnvJwMaa	I would switch to women's one a day prenatal.  You take two pills, one of the pills is a folic acid supplement, my doctor recommends it.  They don't make me feel sick and you don't feel like you have to choke them down.  Plus one of them is pink!  $ 20 for a one month supply is the only downside.  Hope you find one you like!
mgiJVjaKaa	Talk to your doctor about what is safe to do at the dentist while pregnant. Some teeth work is fine while pregnant, but if they're using gas, codeine, etc, then that's not ok so you need to get something written up from your doctor about what they can/cannot do. <br>  <br>  I've already had my teeth cleaned (my doctor actually said this was a good thing) and will be getting a paper from my doctor for a filling. My dentist won't do any work without the paper and doctor's approval, so I have to wait for the dr visit before I can set up to have my tooth filled.|`|PfIywLLyaa	I have had several issues with teeth while pregnant. I had an abscessed tooth, and they were able to take x-rays (they just double - shielded me), they did the root canal, filled it with porcelain, and I even had to take pain meds (tylenol 3) for two days. My baby is doing just fine - very active, big for her age (32 weeks), and all tests have come out good.<br>  <br>  I also had a tooth break, and they ended up putting a crown on it. I dentist shopped and found a dentist that I could afford with my insurance coverage, and my crown looks great!<br>  <br>  Find a new dentist and save the teeth!|`|pp9RzHvDaa	Oh my goodness!  Don't let him pull out your teeth just because you're pregnant!  Wait and have them capped.  This dentist sounds like a whack job!  Just leave them how they are now and your baby will be fine and you can get them capped.  Pulling teeth, ugh no.  It is an awful experience.  If they're broken, they're broken.  There won't be any change unless you neglect your teeth and let them rot away, which I'm sure you won't!  But change dentists!|`|hIzQyflqaa	change dentists! if they can be saved then there are things that can be done still while you are pregnant! you cant have xrays and you cant have amalgam put in your teeth but there are other options!|`|079d2408b404792068cec1c2e4eb8488aa	I had toothaches with both of my pregnancies and the only thing that concerned me was having mouth x-rays. I haven't had either one pulled or cut out and the babies are fine. I would say if you can wait until you have the baby that would be best... but if the pain is so horrible you can't stand it I would get them pulled as you are putting yourself under stress you need not be under|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Ok for of all you need to find a new dentist ASAP.  Second of all I am SHOCKED he would tell you that you could just wait it out.  That is COMPLETELY incorrect.  It is very important to have any dental issues fixed as soon as you can because your body is much more prone to infection.  And if you get an infection in your tooth it can spread.  As for not being able to fix it without pulling it I dint think that's correct either but I dont know for sure.   So please get a second opinion and don't use that dentist nemore!|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	an infection would be bad for the baby perhaps if it was allowed to fester but having a broken tooth shouldn't be a problem assuming you can stand the pain.  Are we talking a fractured tooth?  or broken just slightly or broken so badly that the tooth must come out?  <br>  <br>  Pregnant women can get root canals and fillings, crowns and extractions while pregnant.  There is no reason not to go ahead with the work, if assuming, extraction is your only option (something you have to decide if you agree or would like a second opinion).  If you get an extraction then afterwards you will probably want either a bridge, partial denture or an implant if you can afford it.  Holding off the work now because you are pregnant is not a good reason since chances are you willbe WAY more busy after the baby comes and have harder time getting aroun d to getting the work done.  <br>  <br>  I had a crown put on a fractured tooth while I was pregnant.  Had the work done during 2nd trimester.  Everything worked out just fine for me and I'm glad I did it then because I haven't even bothered for my regular check ups since dd was born and I used to be a dental assistant so I know how important regular cleanings are!!!

Kh5o3QCcaa	I wouldn't spank a teen....<br>  <br>  I grew up with corporal punishments.  My grandma was traditional and I would have to go out and pick my own switch... anyone who has received this one will always remember the first time... you know the one where you thought you would out-smart your Nana by picking the thinnest switch.. ha ha.  Then there was the belt, and the spoon, and yes the fly swatter.  The fly swatter didn't last long when after I showed my principal the welt it left on me.<br>   <br>  I personally don't subscribe to spanking my children... but it's not because I don't agree with spanking-- It's because I believe each child responds best to different punishments based on their age and personality.  My daughter is a sensitive sort, and my being displeased with her is punishment enough (she is a pleaser at heart) so we do time outs and talks.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't spank a teenager... I feel that's too old for a butt whoop-in, and borderline perverted to ask your teen daughter to drop trou.  When I became a teen, my corporal punishment was exchanged for grounding, which was more affective on me.  I left the situation to thinking about how I didn't want to do that again because I wanted my luxury back, where as when I was younger and spanked I would leave the situation thinking how big of a b**** my punisher was and didn't even consider what I did to get there in the first place.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	I'm 17 and think it's just absolutely inappropriate and violating to hit a teenager. I very seriously doubt it would be effective for most teens, and it would probably breed resentment and shame. Teenage girls struggle enough with their confidence, so why tear it down even more with a humiliating punishment?<br>  <br>  I'm willing to bet that you'll have a troll who has answered like 2000 questions only about spanking answer this question, and he'll say that a "a couple of quality minutes with dad's belt on the bare behind" is exactly what a teenager needs, but most normal, well-adjusted people who don't have spanking fetishes are not going to be supportive of this at all, and many will be offended.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	My daughter is 19 years old, moved out and will whip her @ss on her wedding day if need be and she know it. See the thing is I can't  remember the last time I did spank her but I will tell you one thing it should be a last resort and is not abuse. Hitting a child with your fist is abuse. A few good swats with a switch or a fly swatter isn't. If you listen and watch what is going on, corporal punishment is highly avoidable.|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Sorry, but when I was a young teen, developing a social life, having my privileges taken away or being grounded was MUCH harder than taking a quick spanking. Actually, if my mom gave me a choice I would have chose the quick spanking to get it over with and go have fun. At that age, you should be considering grounding instead.|`|rVCM8DgFaa	my family always adopted the 12 and up is too old for spanking<br>  <br>  however, working the child developmental field i can tell you that a teenage daughter or preteen is going to respond much better to immediate loss of privileges or opportunities rather than a spanking.  Most children of any age respond better to immediate punishments of loss of an item or opportunity to do something rather than physical punishment.  <br>  <br>  The most important and i cannot stress this enough, is follow through, if you you are going to replace spanking with loss of lets say, internet, be sure this is something you can live with, for example if she loses the right to internet it must be totally gone, no aim, no email no internet even for school (which means you will be at the library doing things the old fashion way) for the set period of time that should be determined and explained to the teen BEFORE the incident arrives, lack of follow through is responsible for a teen not responding appropriately to the punishment.  Threats to take things away that the teen knows arent going to happen or be enforced only allow the teen to act out even more with no consequence.|`|k7pqisSXaa	It is inappropriate to ever spank your daughter.  A teenager?  Seriously?  That is HIGHLY inappropriate and HIGHLY ineffective.  I would try talking with my child.  I would try letting my daughter know how special she is to me and how much I care about her.  I would try explaining to her the reprecussions she could experience by making certain choices (not by me, but by life in general).  I would try asking her opinion on whatever it was that upset me.  Is it really that she is doing something dangerous...or is it just that she is breaking an arbitrary rule that I have?|`|bdWO9wSAaa	No form of punishment my parents give me honestly works. Same with my sister. If they take away her phone, she takes it back. If they unplug my internet connection, I fix it. <br>  <br>  Spanking for a teenager just doesn't work. Loss of privileges may work, but for me, it never does. I pretty much just say, "Okay, **** you." to the loss of privileges stuff. And my sister will badger my parents into getting her stuff back until they snap. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ki3XY49daa	If she's a teenager, you take away the one thing she strives for.  Her independence.  If it's bad enough, you take away all her freedoms and see if that does the trick.  That's what I would do.  Disconnect the cable in her room, take away the computer modem, hide her cell phone.  Whatever she treasures most, take it away.  She'll get the point.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Hitting your children is wrong, it's child abuse.<br>  <br>  If your child is naughty enough to need a spanking then it is only because you made them that way by loosing control.<br>  <br>  How do you expect to raise a well mannered child and teach them that violence is wrong if you are hitting them....|`|XfXadm1Zaa	me and my wife have two 14 year old daughters their twins we don't spank them infact i cant even remember the last time we did so<br>  <br>  when they do behave wrongly we simply ground them and lecture them on why good behaviour is a must at our home, the more they misbehave or act up the longer they are grounded. we take away their cellphones, laptops and tv.|`|f6aqMg97aa	50 LOL!<br>  <br>  You can always try talking but, having a teenager it doesn't work that way.

1uAduUKhaa	I an Aunt who will be 26 in March and I have a 19  year old nephew.   I am the youngest of 4 sisters and my sister believes that her  children should respect me as her sister regardless of my age.  Although our ages are only 7 years apart, my nephew addresses me at Aunty E_ _ _.  He benefits from me as a woman who protects him and nurtures him. He respects my station as his Aunt and his understands his place as my nephew. .<br>  <br>  My sister has cute pictures of me changing my nephews baby diapers when he was only a few months old and I was just 8.  I was mature from age and began to develop quite early.    I was allowed to babysat my nephew from the time I was 11,  I changed his diapers until he was 6.  One more than one occasion when I would go with my sister and her kids to the beach or the mall, I would take my nephew into the ladies room to potty so that he would be safe.  I felt proud to be so young yet be trusted as a mature young woman with a young boy who wasn't that much younger than me. <br>  <br>  At no time did I ever let my nephew see me in any state of undress other than in a bikini.   I was taught early on that as a woman and as his Aunt, I had an important role to play in my nephews growth and development.      <br>  <br>  It is important to remember that you are a woman and your nephew is a just toddler.  As a woman and an Aunt, you are a role model and an authority figure to him.  When you undress your nephew to give him his bath and change his diapers, your little nephew deserves to see a mature Aunt caring for him, nurturing him, and loving him.   When his Aunt undresses him to bathe or diaper him, he is all bare and cute, you take your privilage as woman and excercise a powerful and responsible prerogative as an adult.   <br>  <br>  The next time that you wash him in the tub or massage baby oil on his bum and petey as you diaper him, pay attention to how you are dressed.   Try wearing jeans, heeled pumps and a top that compliments your womanly figure and wear a little make-up too.   Your nephew will be undressed and very vulnerable  but he will see a mature young woman caring for him.   This is an opportunity for you to gain your trust and he learn to respond to you with loving sweetness. Just you watch !  <br>  <br>  Don't relinquish your right and privelage as a woman and an Aunt by being immodest at a level that is beneath your station.  Instead be his feminine loving Aunty and enjoy your privelage as a caregiver as your maternal instincts guide you and prepare you for your future roll as a mother.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	When he is around 4. Right now he does not realize that there is anything to be concerned about. He changes into pajamas, why wouldn't you?|`|YBQvzEhGaa	He will not see you as a sexual object if he sees your naked body.

It was the first thing we ever drank!|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	I stumbled across a forum once on this very topic. Many, many mothers talked about their husbands drinking it, or at least trying it. Also, the majority of them said that they took it from the breast, not a spoon or something. A lot mothers even talked about their husbands enjoying it, and how they (the husbands) did it not just once, but frequently.<br>  <br>  I read how other mothers were full (engorged), and since the baby was sleeping, they had their husbands empty them out. The forum really shocked me, because I didn't realize how common it was for men to do this! This forum had page after page of personal stories. Honestly, it was a bit strange to me.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's gross for the husband to try it out of curiosity . . . But to do it frequently, or for men to use nursing as a comfort activity is too much.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	I know lots of men who have tried it; women, too.  It is kind of hard to be walking around all day producing milk and not be urged to see what the baby is drinking.  He didn't like, drink a bunch for a meal or anything, but he wanted to see what it tasted like (probably because I said "wow, this is really sweet, a lot better than formula")<br>  <br>  If you put it in his coffee, he probably wouldn't even notice.  Unless he drinks his coffee black...|`|23C49tEOaa	i will never forget the way my husband reacted the first time that we were breastfeeding our preemie.  the nurse was showing me how to do some massage techniques to let my milk "down" when all of a sudden a stream came shooting out of my breast right at my husband.  he jumped so far back so fast the nurse and i both thought that he was going to fall over.  we both laughed so hard.  i have tried to get him to try it- as it does taste very sweet, but he is having nothing of it.  i don't think we will ever know.... maybe it's cuz they are jealous.  not only do we get the boobies, but they also serve a function.. Lol|`|XPnCeJ29aa	My ex asked, and I was responded with, "I mean, if you really want to try it..then...i guess..."<br>  He said<br>  "Aww you're sweet, I just wanted to see what you would say, you go through all that work for that tiny amount and you were even going to let me try some?"<br>  <br>  He didnt lol|`|TQVMAZUbaa	I could never get over the idea that it's really nothing more than a bodily excretion.  <br>  <br>  Somehow when it comes in a cold jug from the store, it's more palatable.|`|eCFAcd8Paa	I know plenty of men that have tried it, it's natural. They didn't necessarily enjoy it, but they were curious.|`|5WYeHh0paa	I keep trying to convince my husband to promise me that he will try my milk once it comes in. Its a no go. He finds it disgusting.|`|AA11579822	NO! It tastes sweet, as if it had a little sugar in it.

2f6diQBiaa	I'm going to have IUI done this month. From what I hear, it doesn't hurt at all.

oVxr5B3Eaa	By the green pills, you mean the 4th week of pills? (I haven't seen those ones to know the colors but they all do the same thing). You might not get it at all if you just started them, but for me it's around the 3rd or 4th green pill. My roommate doesn't get hers until the second last pill in the pack.<br>  It's unlikely you'll get it on the day of the first sugar pill, because you have to wait until AFTER your first sugar pill... Anywhere between the 2nd sugar pill and not at all, though it's usually around the 3-4th for most people.|`|xytNERzlaa	You can get your period anytime within the "sugar" pills. My sugar pills started on a sunday and I would get mine on Wednesday or Thursday. So it depends on your body's adjustment to the pill.|`|Rx31LHjbaa	When I took birth control, I started the placebo pills on Sunday, and I usually got my period on Wednesday.  It usually lasted until a couple of days after I had started back on the next month's pack.    <br>  <br>  You're actually not getting a "true" period, it's called withdrawal bleeding and it happens as the hormone levels drop off in your body while you are taking the placebo pills.  It takes a few days of placebo pills for the hormone levels to drop off enough for this to happen.  <br>  <br>  When you are on birth control the lining of your uterus doesn't build up as much as normal, so there is nothing really to be shed, and therefore no "real" period.  When you are taking the placebo pills, there is just enough change in your hormone levels to cause some disruption of the thin lining, which leads to some bleeding.  This is why periods are typically lighter and shorter on birth control. <br>  <br>  But- the main answer to your question:  You get your period around the time you take the placebo pills.  It doesn't start and stop exactly on the first and last of that week.|`|3IQpCzEoaa	I am on Seasonale and I have white sugar pills. Sometimes I start the first day of the white pills, sometimes 3 or 4 days into it.  Not a big deal! If you do not get your period and if it is possible you could be pregnant, you should take a pregnancy test!

oiJITSNZaa	Wait and when your period is past due take a test!|`|jaP0TANdaa	Well, do you know for sure when you ovulated (since not even close to every woman ovulates mid-way through her cycle)? With your cervix raising and getting softer along with the runnier and thinner discharge, I'd say that sounds kind of like ovulation. Perhaps you ovulate late in your cycle? If you know you've ovulated, I'd say that it's just something that's happened. A lot of women will get a milky, white, lotiony discharge during their luteal phase (after ovulation, before your period) due to the increased progesterone levels in your body during that time and it's completely normal. Your cervix can and will change positions and textures throughout the day. Activity and/or standing too long can even cause your cervix to change positions. It's definitely too soon for these changes to be due to pregnancy. Just hold tight for a while and pray that AF doesn't come... then test and get your BFP!

Sleep needs are somewhat individual, with some kids requiring slightly less or more than their peers.<br>  <br>  Without adequate sleep, growth problems — mainly slowed or stunted growth — can result. Growth hormone production can also be disrupted in kids with certain physical sleep problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea.<br>  <br>  More than your child's height can be affected by a shortage of sleep. Some kids fail to produce enough growth hormone naturally, and a lack of sleep makes the problem worse. It can lead to a condition known as growth hormone deficiency that can affect heart or lung strength or immune system function. (It's treatable with a supplementary hormone.)<br>  <br>  Kids who don't get enough sleep show other changes in the levels of hormones circulating in their body, too. Hormones that regulate hunger and appetite can be affected, causing a child to overeat and have a preference for high-calorie carbs. What's more, a shortage of sleep can affect the way the body metabolizes these foods, triggering insulin resistance, which is linked to type 2 diabetes.<br>  <br>  A lack of sleep at night can also affect motor skills and concentration during the day, leading to more accidents and behavioral problems, and poor performance at school.|`|653f29fd2c842f2aad32073beddf9590aa	7:30 we read one or two books (depending on the behavior) by 8pm lights out and to bed!

DhmUgq0maa	Try Gripe water or cool boiled water.<br>  <br>  Give him a bottle of water with a pinch of brown sugar in it.<br>  <br>  Boil prunes in a pan of water then let the water cool down an feed it to him.<br>  <br>  Also i've heard apples are good for constipation but i've never tried that one.|`|7PXFXcKfaa	i dont know ... my newborn gets really gassy and her poop gets built up a bit, and what the nurses showed me was to dip a cottonbud in a little water, and put the head of the bud inside her ***, and wiggle it in a circle a little bit.<br>  <br>  This works really really well for gas, as often babies get scared and kind of hold it in if its painful, and often when i do she does a poo anyways. It seems like when she feels something at the entrance of her ***, she thinks shes doing a poop and just relaxes.<br>  <br>  As i said i dont know how this ill work for a 9 month old, but its certainly worth  a try.<br>  <br>  good luck, and i really hope the pain goes away soon.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	If she is screaming in pain you could try using Glycerin suppositories, they are gentle and seem to lubricate the baby's bottom and soften things up in there.<br>  <br>  The drug stores have them, ask for children's glycerin suppositories.|`|Ml8n0rqMaa	glycerin suppositories|`|IA1irLy7aa	if the baby is in that much pain you should take baby to the ER don't give him sugar and water as that may upset the tummy more. or you can go to the pharmacy they have lots of good things to use that are SAFE. there are a lot of home remedies out there that have helped some children i used the advice from someone on here once and it gave my baby an allergic reaction and i felt so bad for my baby the safest thing to do is go to the hospital or pharmacy.|`|0ZrRRGmiaa	If you think your baby needs to poop now, I'll share a story. When my little girl was constipated at 7 months of age, I put her in a warm shallow bath, and bent her knees towards her stomach in a very slow back and forth motion. She ended up pooping like mad all in the tub but it worked. The water calmed her down a bit and the motion of her knees going up to her belly then straight again got everything moving. Its a little messy and you have to re-bathe but its very well worth it!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, corn syrup and water... just enough corn syrup to cover the bottom of the bottle.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	if you can go to the drug store and get those infant suppositories.  i had to do for my daughter a few times because she just wasn't going and when I used those with in minutes she went and it was almost rock hard poor thing she would've never been able to go on her own.  if you can't get out to the store try some water or maybe a little juice...liquids can help or rotate your babies legs clockwise it can help to work things out lol hope baby feels better soon!!!|`|U9BetxqOaa	When my daughter was young and constipated my grandmother would say take a small piece of soap and place it rectally, it really works and is harmless, it's like giving a soap enema.|`|F7i4heAcaa	Use a thermometer and "take his rectal temp". It should make him go.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	some prune or pear juice!!!|`|dcPve6Yuaa	warm prune juice!|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	the fastest way to relieve that is the baby safe anal supository. they work extremely fast and painless to put in|`|u94HOVz7aa	when ever this happens to my sisters daughter she takes their temp rectally and it usually helps break it loose.

Every woman is different so it may happen sooner or it may not happen until after you've given birth and the surge or horomones shift.  I wouldn't worry too much.  <br>  <br>  congrats on your 1st pregnancy|`|AA11661793	Sometimes it never happens before you deliver. It can happen anytime, but I never leaked.
IU4uNH97aa	I LOVE THE NAME ANISTON but yes unfortunately right now i would think of Jennifer Aniston. As other people have been saying by the time she has grown up people will not have such a strong association with Jennifer. I say if you love the name then you should go for it ! <br>  <br>  If your saying Meah like Leah but just with a M instead. Aniston Mea Cooley sounds awesome. I think its cute and very unique.<br>  <br>  I have a niece named Aniston ' Annie ' Maeve her brothers name is Cameron Foster.|`|1khNE20iaa	I love it!<br>  I'd change the spelling to Anniston or Anistyn.<br>  It probably will be associated with Jennifer Aniston, but I doubt her classmates will even know who she is.<br>  Aniston Meah Cooley sounds nice, but I don't like Meah too much.<br>  I like Mia or Maya instead.<br>  For a brother I'd name him Aristotle, call him Ari for short :)<br>  For a sister I'd name her Athena or Diana.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I really like the name, oddly. What about Aniston Maeve instead?<br>  <br>  She MAY be associated with the actress, but by the time she's old enough her friends won't even know who J.

AA11906603	Here is a recipe for making English Muffins by hand, just in case she might respond well to making them herself. (I have a granddaughter this age.) Then the argument could be about who makes the better muffin - her or the store.|`|YUAegpPoaa	With the example of a bagel, roll, or a muffin of any other kind? Buying them whole and slicing yourself may help.<br>  <br>  My favorite story to tell on my daughter, while she rolls her eyes of course, is how long we had to try to convince her to taste a chocolate milkshake.|`|cL0aHkYEaa	She's nit picking in a way that should make you proud, because by holding tenaciously to the position that there IS a crust on an English muffin, she is demonstrating to you that she has a pretty well-developed set of perceptual skills.  She has internalized that certain hardnesses or softnesses translate (conceptually) to "bready" or "crusty."<br>  <br>  Actually, I think I might go so far as to agree with your daughter that there is a crust.  If we take Webster at his word, then crust is "1 a: the hardened exterior or surface part of bread," and an English muffin does have an exterior surface...<br>  <br>  So maybe the discussion could be resolved by telling her that you've given it some thought and have decided that she is right after all.  :-)  <br>  <br>  Beyond that, though, if getting your child to eat an English muffin is the issue, maybe she will  just have to pick the crust off without Mom's help...or maybe toast it a little less for her.|`|2cc75788c0a85d7434cad7a54afd37ecaa	confuddle him with even stranger problems.<br>  <br>  "why are there no bones in hot dogs"<br>  <br>  "When you spin around real fast, how does the food stay inside?"<br>  <br>  "If vegetarians eat vegetables what do humanitarians eat?"<br>  <br>  "Do ants have uncles?"<br>  <br>  Make the entire world a chance to explore. Don't go shopping, go on an adventure to Kroger. Lobsters are always a hit. Then send the rest of time walking like lobsters. All kids are curious KitKat, and your little ones are really bright, engage them in weirdness of the world and soon they'll be eating english muffins with marmelade from India.
be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I had my membranes stripped twice when I was pregnant with my son. It didn't work the first time but after the second time my son was born within 24 hours.<br>  <br>  I bled both times. I actually bled more the first time than i did the second.

I didn't spot or bleed after that (I was 39 weeks). I had it done a week later at 40 weeks and I spotted slightly for a day. She did say I may spot, so she'd give me a pad just in case but not to worry if I didn't so don't worry. Good Luck with your baby. I hope the membranes stripping helps you along. I did it twice and am still waiting.
NroZQN5vaa	I'm not too sure about the stages but, when you're doing homemade baby food, it depends on what the baby can handle and when they can eat certain foods. By age, not by when you start them on solids. Check out www.wholesomebabyfood.com It has a ton of information that will help you out.|`|vue9NOhYaa	The main difference is the size of the jar.<br>  <br>  Also stage one foods are all 'pure' foods (just a single ingredient and water.) Stage 2 is often mixtures, and may contain starchy fillers or sugar. (esp. the 'dinners' and 'desserts.')  <br>  <br>  If she's hungry enough for stage 2, feel free to move on.  If she's just eating tastes and dabs, stick with the smaller jars to minimize waste. She can go right from stage one to finger foods without ever eating stage 2.|`|iH2whFkHaa	I believe it's because stage one is mainly non-mixed foods( I am not sure because I don't do jarred baby food) ; you have to introduce only one food at a time so that if she has an allergy you know right away what caused the reaction.  I think stage 2 moves on to mixed foods like strawberry-banana.<br>  <br>  ***********and it is a total myth that babies can't handle texture or thicker foods at first; my boy is 6 months old and I just gave him chicken for the first time a couple days ago and he ate it right up with no problems. Also meat is one of the best first foods for baby since it is rich in iron. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16456417" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16456...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.homemade-baby-food-recipes.com/introduce-meat-to-baby.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.homemade-baby-food-recipes.co...</a>|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well if you look at stage 2 it says for about 6 months and older meaning that stage one is for a little younger, although lot's will disagree but it is the truth. I started her on solids at 4 months and she is just fine and very healthy she is 7 months old and she is on stage two!|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	I think it is a matter of when you feel the baby is ready but it does say on the jars of my beechnut baby food that stage one is "for beginners" and stage 2 "from about 6 months".<br>  <br>  My son is 5 months and is eating 2 entire jar of stage one for lunch and dinner so I am thinking about starting stage 2 really soon!|`|R1eten5Haa	It is just the consistency they have to get used to. If you give her stage two foods and she doesn't gag, then it is fine to feed her. :-)|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Stage one is a little runnier than stage 2, and stage 2 is just a larger amount. My son is 10months and he is still on stage 2 but also fingerfeeding.|`|723QHuicaa	It is based on the fact that they will not be used to anything but liquid, therefore may not know how to chew with the lumps and bits in stage 2 & 3.<br>  <br>  Start at stage one. Guage how well she is coping with eating from a spoon. Attempt stage 2, if she isnt ready - jump ship. Leave it a week and try again. My daughter wasnt ready for stage 2 till 8m, she went from stage 2 to table foods at 9m.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, you could google ''Baby Led Weaning''. I wish I'd have known about it when starting solids, I would definately have given it a go. But I did start solids with a spoon and my daughter was absolutely fine - so I certainly am not bashing your decision.

IA1irLy7aa	i never had urinary bleeding after my c-section. it could be caused by something else.
wphLaVs6aa	I had sore nipples in the early weeks and have heard lots of women say they did too, even though so many lactation consultants insist that breastfeeding should never hurt. I think some pain is normal while your nipples get used to the intense suckling! <br>  <br>  Anyway, I digress. Back to your question. Lansinoh helped me. I used it liberally. Also, rub some breastmilk on your nipples after feedings to help soothe and heal any cracks. Try to air your breasts as much as possible and avoid using soap on your nipples when you shower. (the lansinoh is safe for baby and your nipples secrete oils that protect and self clean)<br>  <br>   I hope you feel better soon.|`|xzMkUCizaa	Yes try the lansinoh cream [most likely found in the baby product aisle ;-)]. It is thick so rub it in your fingers a bit to make it smoother to go into your skin. I was unable to breastfeed my son due to health problems but I did meet up with a lactation specialist that told me I could put the ice gel packs on my breast but not for a long period of time. She also said that I should massage my breast a lot and if able too take a warm bath and relax a bit. Which not only helps your breast in general feel better but also takes a little stress away from you :D<br>  You can also try going into the website below, it provides all kinds of information regarding breastfeeding.|`|kowvnRhXaa	GERBER makes a "breast stick" ... i used this every time after i fed my daughter and son, and after i showered to keep my nipples from being painful.  the great thing about the gerber stick is that you keep your fingers clean, its easy to travel with and cheaper than the lansinoh brand... check it out! <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp?productId=2736631" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.com/product/index.jsp...</a>|`|uMIvRRjoaa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/03a-sore_nipples.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/03a-sore_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/newman/03b-treatments_sore_nipples_breasts.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/newman/03b-treat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nipplehealing.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/natural-treatments.html#teabag" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/natural-t...</a><br>  <br>  HTH!!|`|eDmdkUO3aa	You can try using the Lansinoh cream.

You can put it on your nipples in between nursing it is safe for the baby.  I have to agree if the babies latches right you will stop hurting in a day.<br>  Here's what I had to do:  Line the babies nose up with the tip of your nipple so that the babies head has to tilt to and your nipple will go up in the roof of the babies mouth.<br>  If you can see any of your areola then take your finger and break the babies latch and start over.  This will surely make the baby upset when the baby crys his mouth will open wide and it will make it easier to get your entire nipple in his mouth.<br>  <br>  Good luck it does get easier!!!  Hang in there.  I am so proud of you for nursing it is so good for you and the baby. It will get easier. It took me 6 weeks to get it right.|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	If it's actually pain and not just soreness, then he is NOT latched on properly. If it is your nipples that is probably the problem as baby should not be just on your nipple. Breastfeeding should not be really painful.<br>  If you are just sore it's normal (unfortunately for some). If you look next to wear they sell nursing pads in the baby section they also sell a cream meant specifically for breastfeeding moms. The brand I hear about most is Lansinoh.

It is cute.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Freeze some small plastic toys in cups, and let her melt them out.<br>  <br>  And get some funnels, strainers in the cooking dept.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	My son has this frog and a turtle that you put in the water and it makes a small size tub fountain as it floats. He loves them! They take a AA size battery or two but the batteries go in a water tight compartment on the bottom and last a LONG time between changes. <br>  <br>  We also have a set of tub flutes that are different colors. You fill them with water to different levels to change the sound. He loves to blow these and play in the tub. We also have a foam floating xylophone that he likes to play in the tub.  Both of those are by "Alex Toys" and I believe Target carries them in the toy aisle, but we found ours in a set at Sams.<br>  <br>  Another thing we've found that is fun are the stick on letters/numbers and these stacking ring type things that double as squirters for the tub.  We have little plastic boats and he also likes empty containers from frosting (the plastic tubs that it comes in) to fill and dump. If you get a punch that is strong enough put holes in one and leave the other as is and it's fun for them to fill and watch it pour or sprinkle out the holes.  <br>  <br>  Dollar stores are also big fun for tub toys. Get the foam animals in the little capsules and drop them in as you fill the tub so they pop open and they have the sponge animals to play with.  Regular, soft sponges are fun too (the ones without the scrubbers on them).   A small plastic colander can be fun in the tub for kids also.  <br>  <br>  Little Tikes also makes this thing called "Bath-ketball" that is fun. The rubber balls with it double as squirters. It stays with suction cups to the wall or tub and sticks really well. My son loves his and I'm sure a little girl would love to play with it as well. <br>  <br>  You could get the bath mits that look like animals. They are pretty much useless as a washingn tool but they make fun tub puppets. Just be sure that you hang them up after using and wash them out every other time to keep them from getting icky.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure who makes it, but there is a tub toy that is a little dog that the kids can make dirty and then give the puppy a bath in the tub to clean it and the dirt magically disappears in the water and reappears when dry.  I think Toys R Us or somewhere like it carries it.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	Kitchen stuff!  bowls, plastic spoons strainers.  My daughter likes to take her dolls, the plastic ones in the tub with them.  she washes them with a wash cloth so they are cween.<br>  <br>  BUBBLES!!!  Blow some bubbles for her, or get a bubble machine.  I saw one in Walmart that has a suction cup and is for the tubbie.  In the baby section.|`|reO9Dgmsaa	Sophie has a large bucket and two cups, and uses my hairbrush to whisk bathwater in them, telling me she is cooking!  LOL!<br>  She also has the bath squirty animals and can play in the tub all day!  My little mermaid!! :)|`|PrxlHUT5aa	squirt toys perhaps :o) or make bubbles... that's always a hit with the kids.|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	My little boys have Bruce off of Finding Nemo, it swims around the bathtub.  We bought them at Walmart.  That is one of their favorites.  They also have little fish with shapes that they can try and put in the right spot on the fish.  The shapes are different colors so it's educational too.  They can stick on the wall to play with them like that or you can take the shapes out and let the fish float in the water and it comes with little plastic fishing poles to catch the fish with.  I think we found them at Kmart.  They also have rubber duckies, frogs and fish, little boats, a shampoo cup they like to play with, empty shampoo bottles, sponges and bath crayons, markers and paints.  I usually buy quiet a few bath toys at once but only give them one new one at a time so they don't get burnt out on all of their toys at once.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	My daughter has a couple of bath books, some cups and strainers, and some squirting animals.<br>  <br>  Her favourite thing to play with in the bath though, is a bunch of baby washcloths lol.  She likes to have 5-10 in there and she plays with them the whole time.|`|46tTmMT7aa	Bowls.<br>  Spoons.<br>  Measuring cups.<br>  She has bath crayons. <br>  And the only really toy she has is a "floating kitchen sink" made by Sassy.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Emma has the run of the mill bath stuff, some fish, ducks, cups.  She also has some Easter eggs.....I recently got her some finger paint for the tub and she likes it.|`|AA12205301	My daughter hates bath toys but loves to play with the caps off of hairspray bottles, and she loves putting all the shampoo and bath gel bottles in the water with her.|`|FfGHHhqBaa	my 15 month old loves to play with rags and cups, sometimes she brings her big sisters barbies in with her|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	We have bath crayons too and some squirt toys.

It just shows that you're crazy and think only about yourself.

And I most likely would not do that. It isn't totally not possible. .But chances are I wouldn't.<br>  Because there would be way too many differences.<br>  And most people are too impatient to solve the problem..Leading to divorce?<br>  <br>  There is a big difference between someone who grew up in the city.<br>  And then someone who came from a conventional Muslim family.|`|oOwoyV1Zaa	u dont care for children!!??? thats bad<br>  anywaysssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss<br>  and im very sensitive BUT im not gonna flag this!!! if ya wanna date sum otha woman from anotha country go ahead be my guest!! have a language u dont even understand!!! have u ever met my mom??? she wanted kids and wasnt even a hooker!!

Native Americans aren't even "Americans".

Yes, maybe some are crazy but certainly not all.  Most girls I know are not that high maintenance and I don't really like children.  Don't judge a girl until you actually know her, they are all different.|`|Foi6PFWQaa	I'm American! WTF do you have against American women? I highly doubt you have even met an American woman.

4gZYucHMaa	I think this parenting forum is ridiculous...u have a few self rightous few who only back each other up and a whole slew of others who feel offended when you share an opinion which they asked for in the first place. Parenting is the worst section on here and I've been here for the past 3 yrs (many accounts later hower I come back here bc there are a few who actually get past themself to see what I'm saying)|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	The Y/A parenting section makes me a saner (if that's a word) parent.

Sometimes a simple question on here asking if this or that is normal helps calm my new mom nerves until I can get my daughter in to see her dr.  <br>  I think there's a lot of information, but it can be difficult to muddle through the good and bad advice.<br>  So better parent? No.  <br>  More intuitive? Yes.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I think its great because u get opinions from all kinds of people and you can take everyones opinions into prespective...so yea i guess it does kinda make u a better parent!|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	no, I don't think so, but it has made me aware of the real extremists, so I know which types of people to avoid in real life.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Of course it makes people better parents.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Pregnancy tests that use urine have an accurate negative rate at about 50-ish percent, so yes you could still be pregnant and HCG isn't being secreted in your urine at high enough levels. Pregnancy tests given at the doctor's office and in clinics are the same ones you can buy over the counter and test the exact same way. A blood test is definitely more accurate as they can detect HCG levels as low as 1. You can insist on a blood test or see your primary care to ask for one. If anything else to make sure you don't have an underlying reason other than pregnancy because of your new symptoms (which could be a more serious condition).|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	With this pregnancy I got my first positive on a HPT at 16 DPO. With my previous pregnancy i tested positive at 10 DPO. I truly didn't believe it when at 16 DPO a very faint line appeared (especially when 2 days previous the day my period was due the test was negative). If you truly believe within yourself that you are pregnant keep testing every 2nd day (providing your AF doesn't show). Good luck to you...|`|AaxIZSTwaa	Even if you have irregular periods, you still could have ovulated this month. I know you can get negative HPT and still be pregnant. One of my friends had to finally get blood work done, and she found out she was like three months along, but it just didn't show up on a HPT. So I'd wait a couple more days and if you still don't get your period, try another test!  Good luck!|`|jFrzBCeuaa	Metformin caused me awful symptoms for a couple months. I know it affects everyone differently, but it made me bloated, diarrhea, nausea, etc. Look up the symptoms... I think what you are feeling is the medicine and not a pregnancy. Good luck though.|`|KEu8nqEQaa	If you are 17 DPO your HCG levels should be high enough for an home pregnancy test to detect. Have you been charting your BBT? If you have 18 high temperatures (above your coverline) then that is indicative of pregnancy. Good Luck.

kpnSKV6Eaa	its not that your body is used to pregnancy, it is that your body is still producing hormones higher than normal so in the months to year after a full term pregnancy the hormones make it easier to get pregnant|`|AI2VoFP4aa	i have been told it is easier to get pregnant in the months after you conceive a child because of increased hormone levels. but that doesnt mean its easier in general after you have had a child. i know plenty of ppl that say that they conceived quickly with the first and the second took months of planning and trying before it took.|`|9cu82009aa	Like others have said, it's the increased hormone levels. Although, if you mean conceiving within the first couple of mths after giving birth, that is because your cervix is still wide open and gradually closes within the first 6wks postpartum.
wFfeayBMaa	Babies naturally loose their hair a few months after they're born as hormone levels go back to normal. Another reason is the friction of their heads rubbing on the mattress as they are laying down most of the day at that age. My daughter is 5 1/2 months old and is bald in the back and both sides! She has a patch of long hair on top and that's it!|`|HQf3QPUMaa	My daughter had curly black hair until around 3 months, then it fell out and thinned out all over, especially the bald spot on the back of his head.

IPl3Yh1kaa	I'm not trying to be a smarty, but if you are not having a c-section, and you do not plan on having an epidural, your birth plan should be just to go in there and give birth. From what I hear all the notes go out the window when you're in that kind of pain :-)<br>  <br>  There are options of water, and balance balls (among other things) for assistance of natural birth.

And the expected date is Nov. 29th. <br>  Baby dust to you!<br>  <br>  Keep us posted!
WThYT17Iaa	Amen. I couldn't have said that better myself. I am so tired of the constant unsolicited advice from coworkers, family, friends, friends of family, neighbors, neighbors friends and family, strangers at the grocery store, etc. In the beginning I stressed out about what was right and wrong and then I realized that my baby was going to be just fine. We co-slept for a while and now he sleeps in his own crib. A couple of nights he cried it out until he got used to his own bed. I am fairly certain that my son is not going to be some delusional mental case because I let him cry for 15 minutes one night. Yes I gave him a bottle - I tried to breastfeed but wasn't producing enough milk. I don't feel guilty about that but the nurse sure tried to make me feel like a bad parent. There are plenty of bad parents in this world and because you choose to do something unconventional does not make someone a bad parent. As long as your child is warm, fed, loved, bathed and happy - that is all that really matters. I have thrown out all the how to baby books and life is much easier now.|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	yes! Everyone always has to tell you what is wrong and right for your child and they say if that didn't happen to THEIR child that it isn't normal. But we all raise our children how we think is best and no matter what we love them anyway :)<br>  <br>  good question.|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	Completely sick of it.... but having said that many of us are always questioning ourselves and judging others to make ourselves feel better!! We should all support each other!!<br>  <br>  Great question! It keeps us all on track about what is important.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I do get tired of it.  As long as you are putting your child's best interests first then I don't see why people are so judgemental.|`|PP8PRD9Faa	THANK YOU!!! Yes, I'm completely sick of it. I just started feeling guilty about weaning after 8 months of breastfeeding, so I started looking at others' answers to the "how long" question, and started feeling even more guilty. I felt bad about moving her from our bed to her crib before that, and taking motrin while nursing before that, and giving her a binky before that, and so on and so on...<br>  <br>  Ask your parents what they did or didn't do for you and I doubt they would even remember. They did the best they could with what they had and what they thought was "right", but in the end, parents only need to do just that. Our children will not turn out to be degenerates no matter what the experts or other know-it-alls have to say about giving baby store-brand formula or using the wrong shade of pink in the nursery.<br>  <br>  Go forth, you internet junkies, and kiss your babies!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I am!  I could really care less about all that stuff.  I mean there is some crazy stuff that goes on in the world today.  People on here act as though, your abusing your child if you don't do things there way.  As long as a kid is happy, and healthy, I think your doing a good job, no matter how you do it!|`|pJiTbIpYaa	Totally agree with you. I thought all that mattered was that you loved your child/children and cared for them and looked after them. I didn't realise that what you fed your baby, how your baby slept or anything like that was such a huge issue until i came to this site.|`|4gZYucHMaa	i think people (especially on this forum) need to take a chill pill<br>  <br>  when people are asking a question, people's insecurities get the better of them and so they attack those who ''oppose'' them<br>  <br>  what works for my family doesn't work for others, i get that so when I relay something on here it's an opinion but some people (Aimee, Spacecat) take it to heart and think i'm out to get them  however it's an opinion|`|wphLaVs6aa	Yes! I totally agree that loving our children well is what really matters. <br>  <br>  Motherhood is a source for so much self doubt and insecurity. I think passing judgement is a way to cope with the self doubt. Idont think generations before us had it much better. They just did things differently and had different topics that were contentious. <br>  <br>  That said, this is a forum for asking questions and getting answers. Differences of opinion are par for course. That's what keeps it interesting. I feel like I learn more from the people I disagree with!|`|CzKrqgmgaa	in the big scheme most of those things dont matter... <br>  but some of them lead to life long issues... and every thing that happens to a child has a hand in determining what kind of adult they end up as...<br>  what it really boils down to is that every parent is going to do what they want and feel is right no matter what anyone else thinks|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I agree except for the dummy.. i.e. pacifier... that just needs to go.. it is so bad for their teeth..let them use another comfort item.<br>  <br>  as for everything else.. do whatever floats your boat so long as your child's health is not at risk for it.|`|5Np8w5MCaa	I hear ya!!  All I ever hear is "you can't do that" and "you have to do this" it drives me nuts.  I love my kids more than anything on the planet and that's enough for me.  Every parent makes mistakes and in the end it doesn't matter.  They all grow up and when they're twenty it wont matter if you rocked them asleep, or brought them to bed with you at night, or let them have junk food every now and them.<br>  <br>  I'm so tired of people trying to tell me how I'm supposed to raise my own children.|`|DhmUgq0maa	Yeah there are some very opinionated women who think that everyone should adapt to their way of parenting because it is the best...Not every child is the same and what works for some doesn't work for others so i say leave them to do what they want with their children and you do as you please with your own...It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks of your parenting choices because they are not the one raising your child.|`|R0EsQapRaa	I agree.  It is always amazing to the older generations that there are all these RULES for taking care of children nowadays.  I understand that many of the rules are preventative measures, but people have been raising children since the dawn of time and never had these rules before and did just fine.<br>  <br>  I pretty much follow what my pediatrician recommends, but have issues with the whole bumper pad debate.  I have always used them in my daughter's crib.|`|uLdeIhHqaa	Thats why we are all different as parents. We all have different opinions, views, and thoughts....as long as the child is being raised to the best of the parents ability, being loved unconditionally, thriving, healthy, and happy it doesnt matter! Being different and having different views is what makes the world go round!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I could honestly care less how other parents raise their children-It doesn't affect me at all. It's not like once my kids starts school I'm going to tell them they can only be friends with kids who were breastfed as infants lol. I'm just as sick as you are of all the pointless debates. Nothing someone says on Y!A is going to change how I raise my kids,|`|sAAnquoTaa	Exactly! As long as we love our children and are doing the best we can do for them that's all that should matter.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	yep sure am|`|dAQHWvY0aa	I love hearing what other people do and how they raise their kids. I have my own opinions, but I am the last person on the planet to think my way is the only way. It's how we weed out ignorance in our society, in my opinion. To share is to discover, to understand, and to see from a totally different perspective than your own. I think if we had a little more leniency with each other, a lot could be learned in a day! The problem I have is that people don't trust their instincts nearly enough any more. There is so much self doubt out there, and I think a huge contributing factor to that is not someone telling you that you are wrong, but rather a large institution or authority not telling you everything so that you may make an unbiased decision on your own terms, and in your own time.
OP7chg45aa	i never had alot of viginal discharge to where i thought it was my water breaking but i do want to let you know that once you are feeling contraction 5 minutes apart that you need to go right to the hospital. Because i was having contractions 5 min apart and i thought it was false contractions then i went into labor, and went to the hospital, and 2 mintues b4 i had my son my water broke. <br>  I was in labor for an hour and i got to the hospital 20 minutes b4 giving birth. alot of ppl say that you are in labor for hours but i wasnt so you never know exactly how long you will be in labor. so pay attention to your contractions and drink alot of water because if you get dehydrated that could give you false contractions.|`|nsYRh67daa	could be any time now, but you will defenetly know when its time trust me
80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Most women have gas through their entire pregnancy, so don't worry about it, hun! :)<br>  <br>  You'll be very sore through the last bit of your pregnancy because your baby's head has dropped and it's putting pressure on your pelvic bone. That's very normal.<br>  <br>  Congratulations, by the way!|`|lSiv5PDlaa	from what i hear gas pains may be a sign<br>  if you think it absolutely cant wait til the OB go to the er, it will give you peace of mind<br>  <br>  BUT IF YOUR WATER BREAKS THATS THE DEFINATE SIGN OF ALL TO GET TO THE HOSPITAL!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<br>  <br>  definately not tmi btw ;D|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	I was very sore at the end of my pregnancy. It's from the weight of the baby. I was 4 cm dilated for 2 weeks before I delivered and I lost my mucous plug 2 weeks before. You will know if you lose your plug most likely, but it's hard to tell if labor is definately around the corner.
k4c24zblaa	All doctors and hospitals are different, I was 8wks n 6 days my first appt and they took blood, I had a urine test, an ultrasound and a pap smear done, but like i said all places are different! They will more than likely do an ultrasound since they have already confirmed you are pregnant!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Every dr is different.  Most likely they will not do an ultrasound.  They will just go over what to expect the first trimester.  Some dr do an internal as well.|`|i7F3gl3Yaa	If they just did one, then no. You should probably expect one at about 16 weeks to see the gender.<br>  <br>  CONGRATS!!!!!<br>  <br>  BTW - They sometimes do routine US, but only if there is an issue. I had to get an extra US with my 2nd b/c they thought he may have had a heart issue. But he didn't and I got to see him an extra time lol.
d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	I have to say no. <br>  <br>  If the swimmers are just in the hot tub, then I wouldn't worry about it at all. If it's sex in a hot tub, I stilll wouldn't worry about it. Medically speaking, sperm NEED a certain temperature to exist. IF a man's testes are too hot or too cold, they are pretty unlikely to produce sperm that would live long enough to cause pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So that's my thoughts anyway.|`|dzyJw0cvaa	I think you mean that if a guy ejaculates in the hot tub,can you get pregnant.  NO.  Not possible...now, if you have SEX with the guy in the hot tub.  Yes.  I hope this helped.|`|SiaWY5n2aa	yeah fairly easily. the hot water and chemicals kill a lot of sperm but that makes no difference. you can still easily get pregnant|`|JK2RvliYaa	If someone left some sperm in there, they could swim into your virginia.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yes you could.|`|cnK4X2sZaa	negative...do you mean having sex or sitting in there?  even having sex in the tub i think most of the boys would be killed off by the chemicals and heat...but i wouldn't use it as birth control.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	I did once.<br>  <br>  <br>  *sigh*<br>  <br>  <br>  *stares into distance*<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  *    *    *<br>  <br>  <br>  Ahem.  What was the question?  Oh yeah, but once you impergonate her, make sure she gets out.  Hot tubs are not safe for pregnewt women.|`|lSiv5PDlaa	as long as semen made there way in then yeah you can be, take plan b if it hasnt been too long and pregnancy is a concern|`|pxXKkn7saa	certainly can if ur havin sex you can get pregnant no matter where u ave sex|`|OCyd6yWfaa	oh yeah ... as long as there is sex involved.|`|nsYRh67daa	were you dropped on you head as a child??|`|7QwgAhntaa	Why risk it?|`|p2Njf5gBaa	You betcha.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you have heard myths that the sperm all die because of the heat, well, there are an awful lot of sperm and its only takes one. <br>  <br>  Never rely on wives tales as a method of birth control.
lHDff8Braa	Why can't you just get there before the bus stops and be waiting for him?<br>  <br>  If he's only done this the one time, I don't think it's worth a punishment, but perhaps a wake-up call for you to be there before the bus.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Don't blame him for your lateness. You should be there waiting for him when the bus arrives.|`|1s3nddaYaa	ground him for a couple days from going to a friends house. then tell him the next time he doesn't come home to tell you. that you will ground him again and take something else away as well as not going to a friends house.<br>  <br>  well you ask for advice. why ask for advice. if your not gonna do nething to teach him that he scared the **** out of you? i didn't say spank him i simply said take away him going to a friends house. he is 6 if he isn't listening and you said he knows better , then obviously he needs to be grounded or else he will do it again. let the friend come to your house but as for him he cant go newhere. goodness|`|Po2UqfvWaa	i'd be ticked off too. tell the parents he no longer is able to come over after school until he checks in first. then you will walk him over there. otherwise they are to send him home and call you. no more friends until he does what he is told to do after school. i wouldn't stand outside waiting for a school bus either. they never come on time. if the weather is nice i would, but not this time of year.|`|23jqdYMZaa	You need to punish yourself. You need to reevaluate your priorities. Your child is acting out because something is going on in his life. Either he feels neglected or something else is wrong. At six years old kids just want to please their parents. I suggest you take a day off from work and keep him home from school. Hang out with him and have quality time with him and see if his behavior does not improve. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|jZSGEjAxaa	First off, bravo to you for being involved and willing to parent and punish your child.  So many parents are too busy trying to be friends before parents.  Cant work that way.<br>  Anyway, does your son enjoy riding the bus?  Does he HAVE to ride the bus?<br>  If he likes the bus, but does not HAVE to ride it, then he is no longer allowed to ride the bus for X amount of time until he can prove he is mature and trustworthy enough to handle it again.<br>  If he hates the bus, then thats not gonna help....<br>  If he HAS to ride the bus, then ground him from going to friends houses and having friends over for X amount of time.  And do every thing you possibly can to be there waiting for him before the bus comes, not giving him the apperance of being trusted with the 30 seconds before you arrive. <br>  I agree that the punishment should fit the crime.  He must prove to you that he can make the right choices, or the privaledges he loves will not be available to him.|`|DkVofG9paa	take away something important to him for a couple weeks..  tell him if he doesnt wait next time it will be gone for good.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	You were late, even 30 seconds is late when you are 6.  Tell him that next time YOU are late that he needs to sit down and wait, and that he is not allowed to go with anyone.<br>  You made the mistake of being late, he made the mistake of going with a friend.  You aren't being punished, why should he?  You need to train him what to do when something happens, a 6 year old is incapable of handling the panic and often makes bad decisions because they are worried.|`|FiUprYsvaa	You said YOU were 30 seconds late.<br>  <br>  Meaning that 30 seconds went by and then that extra 30 seconds you were late. Meaning a whole minute went by after he got off the bus. That's a long time for a 6 year old. A minute can be a long time for me sometimes and I am 19. <br>  <br>  If he always knows that you show up 30 seconds after the bus stops then that means he didn't see you after that 30 seconds and his friend offered for him to use the phone to call you. <br>  <br>  If he went over to the friends house to call you, I don't blame him and I wouldn't punish him either. <br>  <br>  I think that waiting to see the bus is a horrible plan. <br>  If the bus comes at 3:10 leave the house at 3:08 or 3:09. Bundle up if it is till cold out and go wait for him. <br>  <br>  You plan is flawed and leaves a lot of room for error, as you have found out. <br>  <br>  Just get there before the bus does and you'll have no problem.|`|lBw50ySpaa	I have 4 sons, and my favorite punishment is push ups.  It helps build their muscles, and their self esteem as well as punishing them.  Of course, you can't make him do it, so you have to give him a choice.  For example, do 10 push ups or I take away your tv or game time for 3 days.  you will be surprised how well push ups work.  <br>  By the way, you can accept crummy push ups for the first few times, but then insist that they are done right, and increase their number as he gets good.  You may have to do a few with him at first.  I know it sounds weird, but this really works.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Let him know how worried you were, but don't punish him.  He's 6 years old.  <br>  Maybe you could show up on time.  Doesn't the bus get there at approx. the same time every day?  Perhaps it wasn't his fault.|`|jLYTKr33aa	The punishment should definitely fit the crime.  I say ground him from playing with his friends after school for the rest of the week.  <br>  I'm glad to hear he's OK - you must have been terrified when you couldn't find him!|`|vpmRRamKaa	you should discipline him<br>  not let him go over his friend's house for a week or two|`|NkYWScEdaa	I was grounded for 2 weeks so I couldn't hang out with my friends for 2 weeks. I hated it, it was terrible.|`|vyGyLV7paa	take away his favorite toy or the thing he uses most for a week or 2|`|rzLGCrlfaa	well did you give him the lecture before or after he went missing but i don't think that just for that calls for a punishment (a punishment to me is getting spanked or grounded) but with the being defiant the next time he does it then you can punish him and i would say a week grounded or a spanking or its it too over the top both|`|ZO7pnS6iaa	DESTROY HIM!!!|`|gZpeoy1Qaa	first he's only 6, He must be getting really tired of waiting on you all the time and may start to feel that you don't care enough about him to be on time to pick him up. You need to be more responsible, a lot can happen in 30 seconds why don't you think about that instead of trying to punish the child for your tardiness. He's a smart child to know to go somewhere safe you should be rewarding him not scolding him.|`|428a2b704623f75c732936e8e018215daa	I usually give "first offenses" a warning, stating what should have happened and the consequences if it happens again.  For this particular offense, the consequence if it happened again may be not being able to go to that particular friends house for a week, possibly.|`|bES0ltC8aa	just ground him... take away tv or something|`|b3c3863dda7cbe4797e9764da4ef8a23aa	He is six years old.  You have no business being late to pick him up.  Be on time, leave 30 seconds earlier if this is a habit for you.<br>  <br>  By you being consistently late, you send a messge to him that punctuality is no big thing.  So to punish him for the very thing you yourself are guilty of is parently hypocritical.|`|8OmL54xoaa	You know considering that he is only 6 years old I would be there, at the bus stop or at any other designated place, on time. I may be wrong, but it seems your son is resenting your being late to get him. Also, you need to consider that your son wants to spend more time with his friends and going to his friends house on the bus was the only way that he could get there.<br>  <br>  Consider also that many crimes are committed against many of our  children, we need to make the effort and supervise them properly. Maybe you two can sit down and negotiate an agreement. GBY|`|qEkPcK9gaa	It seems to me like you son isn't worried about what you say you need to start  disciplining him more like  ground him for 2weeks so he knows you mean business he will get the picture trust me and that also means no t.v or xbox or what ever he likes to do.|`|MQcCDvOpaa	why consequence for the first offense?<br>  <br>  besides you arnt even prepared this time. <br>  <br>  tell him if he does it again there will be consequence. that gives you time to actually think of a punishment, and at the same time it gives him a fair warning.|`|YN0Bs8pRaa	Insist that he hold your hand from the minute he steps off the bus till you get indoors for a week or so. Just so you KNOW where he is as he doesnt seem to be old enough to be responsible. I doubt he would want a second week of it.|`|lqt3wTQvaa	well..if you can't trust him with no supervision (ie not even to wait for you at the bus stop) then you cant trust him at all..that is the lesson to be taught here. you should ground him..and by grounding i mean SERIOUSLY- no TV, no computer, no video games...|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Start being there on time!That is your job!!All your doing is saying it is ok for you to be late.Great life lesson.Just go early and wait if you have to .Lazy|`|t6wMDconaa	hi,<br>  i think that your son is just experiencing life:).<br>  if he keeps defiing you then keep him in the house for a week. then see what happens.|`|BlIEJYibaa	well you should take aay tv computer radio video games and going over to friends house for a week . but in case dat seems wrong limited him send hym to bed one hour early|`|jgl5hn4saa	nothing the kid is 6 you of all people should know what goes through the mind of a 6 year old. they dont always think to clearly.|`|ruP66DEkaa	i've had the same problems with my kids, just don't let him go over to any of his friends houses for the next 2 weeks, it sounds extreme but my kids have never done anything like that sense... if hat dose not work, then i would hurt him|`|6qBG1xrsaa	he's only six. he made an error in judgement. you should not give him a set punishment, but explain what he did wrong and tell him you're annoyed and that if it happens again a punishment will be applied.

( i am addicted to buying from tow auctions)  and i have to say my favorite right now is my van because i have 3 children and that is the only way i can go anywhere with somene else.  but for fewer children any 4 door car is nice.  2 door cars are the worst.  expecially for rearfacing babies.  if you have to have  2 door  car get one with a hatch back because then you can put baby in from the back and dont have to crawl over  the seat and monkey around the carseat.  easier access.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	2008 Prius and I LOVE IT!!!  Best car I've ever had.  I didn't think I'd ever go back to a car after having SUVs for so long, but my main requirement was that our dog could fit in the cargo area, and she fits just fine in the Prius.  It is easy to get my toddler in and out, and the carseat fits just fine (it did rear-facing, too).

d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	I agree with you. Every day I pay $2.00 for my kids lunch at school and I don't complain because it's the right thing to do. What are these people complaining about - their kids are eating for free even if it is a cheese sandwhich?<br>  <br>    This is just the way the country is going. Everyone feels they are "entitled" to everything for free. My question as always is, where is the personal responsibility?|`|PgQui4jNaa	As others have said it's pointless to complain because they are getting fed and it's still healthy for the most part. When I was in grade school I got sent to school with cheese sandwiches cause I didn't like school food or meat sandwiches and I grew up just fine and healthy!<br>  <br>  Plus there's most likely free or reduced lunches set in place they could take advantage of if they are eligible. Then they still get the same lunch as every other kid in the school.<br>  <br>  Like others say: "Beggars can't be choosers."|`|hUbNKOTsaa	geez, they are getting it EASY!!!!!!!! at my middle school, if you dont have lunch money you get 2 crackers and white milk!!! thats all. two saltines and milk. great lunch. that makes me always remember lunch money!!!! at the elementary they get a peanut butter(no jelly) sandwich and white milk. after 3 days at all the schools you get nothing except water|`|vG0tsqJtaa	I agree.  If it was the parents I would say just don't feed them.  I hate that tax dollars have to go to take care of people because they can't do it on there own.  People don't think ahead.  They think well I am just now getting by, job may no last long but I have one now so lets have a kid.|`|Sk6lrUeXaa	There is an old saying.  "Beggers can't be choosers."<br>  <br>  So many people today think they deserve everything and to boot, they think it should come on a silver platter.|`|4RAboDSDaa	If it's a lunch, eat it!!|`|9EMR6BHFaa	My son is in 3rd grade.  At his school, if you don't have lunch money you will get a regular hot lunch.  But after the 3rd time, they will only serve a cold sandwich.  They will not allow anyone to go without a lunch.  I think they should stop their complaining.  Why should the school be responsible for making sure they eat- isn't that what a parent's job is supposed to be?  If they can't afford it, then they should apply for free or reduced lunch.  If they don't qualify for that, they should just be happy those kids are getting anything.<br>  "Beggars can't be choosers"|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	This happened at a local school last year.  It angered me, because they handled it a bit differently.  Some of these children had already been served their hot lunches, and the lunchroom staff went and took their food away from them and gave them the sandwhich meal.  It was embarassing for the students, and ridiculous-they threw away perfectly good lunches.<br>  <br>  But, to be fair, the parents were behind on their children's lunch payments and had been told so several times.  Within a day of this happening, they had all caught up the outstanding balances-which was what the school needed to happen.  They still got fed, so what they ate does not matter (I just do not think they should have taken away meals that were already served), and there is not much room for complaint since it was free.  The schools are already in debt and do not need any issues that are causing that deficit to go up.<br>  <br>  If a parent can not afford their child's lunch, there is a problem.  They can get free or reduced lunch in many cases, and even if that is not the case it is NOT that expensive.  Either pay up, or if you think you can serve them a lunch for less then send one with them.  That is my opinion.|`|irLnPW4aaa	I don't see a problem here.   If the child doesn't bring money for lunch, at least he/she is getting SOMETHING.  If the parents want the child to have the hot lunch, they need to either a. send money for the lunch or b. apply for the free/reduced lunch program.   Its not the schools job to provide a meal for the child if the parent doesn't want to apply for the free lunch program.  <br>  <br>  What ever happeend to parental responsiblity?|`|eCFAcd8Paa	I see nothing wrong with what they're giving out, especially if it is free. It's better than a slice of pizza and a soda that we were offered at my high school. At least they're getting nutrition in the first place.|`|tBtOTiQDaa	when iwas a kid, and i was hungry,<br>  I WOULD EAT TREE BARK FOR GODS SAKE<br>  but now, anything less than caviar is child abuse, because it hurts their "feelings"<br>  like i could care less about some spoiled brats feelings|`|NUmeIxyfaa	I completely agree - food is food and if it is free- then all the better!|`|tbMV3yOFaa	Its the same way at my kids school except with pb&j.  I have to send in there lunch money to be put onto their account.  When there account is over due they send in a little note to let you know.  Well I am not going to send my 5 year old son nor my 7 year old daughter to school with 50 dollars in their pocket.  So I generally wait until I can get to the school and pay for it myself.  Sometimes they might end up eating pb&j.  That is fine.  The only time I ever complained was when the cafeteria lady embarrassed my 5 year old asking him to look in his pocket for his money after he had already sat down.  I took the initiative after that to give her my cell phone number so she could call me herself and not embarrass my children about money issues.|`|vue9NOhYaa	In our district they get a PBJ sandwich.|`|8DnIXwnyaa	I would have been happy to get that for lunch instead of the crap they serve when i was in school|`|5e4e7e69ebfb2ce16276f743ee45219eaa	I think its a good thing to feed them even if they can't afford it.  I know that the kids may feel some embarrassment from being singled out from their peers, but food is food.  It seems that some parents have forgotten that they always have the option of sending a bag lunch to school, and honestly most of the time it would probably consist of...a cheese sandwich.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	That's probably a lot healthier than what some schools serve. I don't really remember getting offered fruit in grade school. I remember pizza,tacos,barbeque chicken,ham and cheese sandwiches,chili....Not very healthy really. Just a lot of meat,carbs....and sodium.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	a meal is a meal... a free meal is not to be criticized. their kids are being fed and it's healthy too boot. good for that school for coming up with something!|`|ibWLdXlJaa	Either send a lunch with them or deal with it. Personally I would just be happy that my kid still gets to eat.
tdHIR9cLaa	i leave it with my son!!!! studies prove that it lowers the risk of SIDS... and i think i pretty much speak for most mommies when i say ill do anything to lower the risk of SIDS...so rest at ease when your son has his pacifier at night its perfectly SAFE!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: the DEEP sleep is the thing you want to AVOID.... that is when profesionals think SIDS stricks the most... becuase the baby is in such a deep sleep that they forget to breath... so the baby sucking on the pacifier helps them from going into that DEEP sleep...|`|BMfn0D9gaa	yep, perfectly safe.  and it does help reduce the risk of SIDS|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	I would say no, it is not safe at all, because just like a bottle they tell you not to keep it in a baby's mouth because it is bad for there teeth because of what it is made of, and they pacifier works the same way, it can cause decay on there teeth and of course that is not a good thing.|`|46tTmMT7aa	I always keep the pacifier with my daughter when she sleeps. It is completely safe to keep with him when he is sleeping, it reduces the rick of SIDS.|`|LDHu66Vraa	I would always take it out of their mouths. I just didn't like the idea of sucking on it when he's asleep|`|weA0Xdszaa	I leave it.<br>  Pacifiers reduces the risk of SIDS.<br>  ;)|`|7PpjxfZ9aa	letting your son suck on his pacifier when he is sleeping is perfectly safe. like someone else answered, it does prevent sids because the pacifier actually keeps them breathing whether on their back, stomach, or side. My daughter is pretty dependent on her passy but i do let her sleep with it sometimes but remember it is a hard habit to stop cold turkey with a baby. but for some it's easier. hope this helps|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Its completely safe a pacifier is proven to help prevent sids so late him have it...a pacifier is fine u dont need to watch him every second just because he has a pacifier in if it wasnt safe they wouldnt sell them!!!|`|j6SZ00dxaa	You should leave it in until they are older because it will help prevent SIDS they need movement when there sleeping.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	keep it in pacifiers are supposed to reduce the risk of sids and it soothes them.

ezMoS0mqaa	the pains are normal as the uterus is growing and you wouldn't have signs of an ectopic until at least 6-8 weeks and then you'd be very ill. You've probably just slept funny... Stop reading stuff online, you will drive yourself mad. <br>  If you are worried see a doctor.<br>  I had light cramps until 7 weeks but so long as there is no bleeding, you are very likely completely fine.<br>  <br>  If you are going to misscarry, sadly there is nothing you can do anyway so stop winding yourself up|`|mgiJVjaKaa	If you have mild aches that are similar to mild cramps, it could just be your uterus stretching. <br>  <br>  My uterus has been stretching for the past two weeks, and I feel it mainly after I've been up and walking around for awhile. My dr told me it's normal, just stretching, and not to stress about it unless it's a bad cramping or there's blood.<br>  <br>  Dont' stress too much :)|`|fZGBjtpVaa	If you're getting pains in your left shoulder, go to the  A + E ASAP.<br>  <br>  I had these pains, and I was 4 - 5 weeks, and turned out to be ectopic.  I don't want to scare you but this is a possibility, better to be safe than sorry.<br>  The cramps are probably just your womb stretching, but I do advise you to go to the A + E as soon as possible.|`|AA11682796	You are probably just over-anxious from hearing about everything that could go wrong, if I were you I wouldn't worry. I'm sure your baby is fine. Just keep eating healthy, go on walks to keep yourself active and find something to keep you busy for the next 8 months, or else you'll go crazy!|`|la1KlgJ3aa	It is things stretching and it is also normal to be crampy at the beginning when you would normally be getting your period. I would not worry. Im sure its all normal. Good Luck!!|`|XGQpERs3aa	At 4-5 weeks i had abdominal pain all the time every single day.  Reading online drove me crazy too.  When I finally saw the OB-GYN at 7weeks she told me that that is normal especially since my body was undergoing changes and my organs were moving around inside to make move for my growing uterus.  Anyway the discomfort stopped mostly by the time I was two months.  The shoulder pain I would't worry too much about.  As long as you don't have severe cramping and pain and bleeding I wouldn't drive myself crazy with worry.   Just see an OB as soon as you can make an appointment.  I am sure everything will be fine.   Your body goes through so much during pregnancy you wouldn't know until you get pregnant.  Congratulations!!!|`|WfHl3dNGaa	if the pain is not severe and often i would not worry . Stretching is common.
vCWVimTzaa	I dont know. Mine was so bad I actually was vomiting blood because my esophagus was so raw from throwing up stomach acid. water would give me heartburn, it was horrible. Zantac is safe to take, but no more than 2 of the 150 pills per day. I took one at morning and one at night and that helped quite a bit. After I started with the blood my OBGYN prescribed something that he though would work better, but it made me so drowsy and having another young child at home, I couldn't take it and be able to function the way I needed to.|`|gmaCvh00aa	LOL, That's a myth about the hair and heartburn.  I doubt a real doctor said that.<br>  <br>  You are having heartburn because all your organs are getting crowded out by that growing little alien inside of you.  Your stomach is pushed up toward your diaphragm, which cannot close properly so the stomach acid gets backed up into the esophagus.  You can believe that, or you can believe the old wives' tale about the hair, but I had wicked heartburn in my last few months and my daughter came out like a cue ball, bald as anything.|`|bc4782da989744a491a7587eecbb2a9faa	Drink plenty of water. You can even add a little baking soda to some of your food. Very little less then a tea spoon.<br>  <br>  With hormones and the baby pushing up your stomach it is no wonder it hurts us so bad.<br>  <br>  Also exercise helps. It will hurt for a few days but you will find what one helps the most.<br>  I walked the block every night and every morning. I laid on the floor and stretched lightly with arms extended and my legs. Breathing deep.<br>  That one does not help all women...warning there it can make it worse. But for me it moved the boys down. I have 3.<br>  <br>  Sometimes squats work wonders. Hold on to a chair or table and squat for the count of 15 and do 5 sets.|`|XWPAjxsGaa	I have heartburn so bad that my mouth gets all this sulliva and i start dribbling its gross and i hate it. i almost cry too dont worry lol..<br>  I take gaviscon. its good and it works straight away, just get it from the chemist.|`|AA10377049	I don't know why heartburn is so bad during late pregnancy, but I can tell you how to get some relief.  Don't eat anything with a lot of calcium, especially milk and dairy products.  Calcium stimulates the stomach to produce acid.  Tums puts you in a catch-22.  It neutralizes the acid in your stomach for temporary relief, but because it has calcium, as soon as it is absorbed, your stomach will be stimulated to produce excess acid.  Milk also gives you the same catch-22.|`|smcWIZxPaa	I had terrible heartburn all throughout my pregnancy.  my doctor actually prescribed me zantac or whatever the generic version of it is.   Ask your doctor because I took it from 20 weeks on.  My baby was perfectly fine too so it doesn't affect baby at all. :) Hope this helps!|`|cnK4X2sZaa	try milk... that seems to work for me. the reason for it b/c your organs are all pushed up.. but try the milk. good luck and hey in the end its all worth it...so they say.|`|rSxSV6tfaa	Because the baby has more hair. The more hair your baby has the more heartburn. I dont know why thats what my doctor had told me. The babies hair causes heartburn.|`|dKokLBMwaa	The easiest thing would to go back in time and have a condom|`|cfdooGylaa	Its not because your baby has a lot of hair, gosh. Thats just an old wives tale. The growing uterus has a strong correlation as to why heartburn gets worse as the pregnancy progresses. Fried foods make the heartburn worse. Take milk AND tums combined and it should go away rather quickly. Good luck!|`|syrh8J6Vaa	I was the same way as you.  I ate tums and crackers and that seemed to help for a little while.  The people who say your baby has more hair are nuts.  After all my heartburn my daughter was born bald.  She did not have hair other than fuzz until she was 2.
GWveqx61aa	well brown blood is old blood, when you hear of implantation bleeding normally you hear of a bright red blood, sorry but most of your symptoms dont happen til a little latter in pregnancy, it sounds possibly like a hysterical pregnancy, i had one of these last month, it was terrible, i thought for sure i was preggo. normally everymonth i get the symptoms, but its only cuz i waant it so bad, this month is weird, my nipples are darker but thats the only sign, af is due march 1st, now even though these sound like fakes, there is always that ray of light, just pray, good luck and baby dust to us all|`|oiJITSNZaa	yes there is such a thing as imagining that you are pregnant to the point that you actually experience some of the symptoms even though you are not. I would say just relax and time will be the true teller. Don't get up your hopes to high as then you will just have all the farther to fall. Good luck!|`|WIEPISyeaa	Well, I know what you mean about imaginary symptoms, but the brown discharge sounds promising!  Good luck!  I hope this is your month!  (Mine too....) Baby dust to both of us!!!!|`|vigFmfLmaa	I think every person who ever TTC has imagined symptoms.  Even people like me, who know they aren't going to get pregnant, are still hopeful.  There's nothing wrong with being hopeful but I feel that there's a problem when someone gets devastated every single month because their "pregnancy" symptoms were just PMS and they don't realize the great similarities.|`|jaP0TANdaa	Honey... I imagine things EVERY month! Heck, I'm still imagining things right now after getting two BFN, one at 10DPO and another at 12DPO, yet I still keep imagining things. I've felt cramping that wasn't "normal", I've had sore boobs that feel bigger (even though this is usual for me before AF), I've been exhausted at times, I've thought that maybe I might feel a little nauseous, and heck I started at my HPT today for so long that I even imagined a faint line there (after taking apart the test, holding it in just the right angle in just the right light). I can honestly say that I think I might be completely insane at this point and I wish AF would just hurry up and get here so I can quit being crazy. She's do anytime now, and I'm just waiting to be disappointed again. Don't feel too badly about feeling like you're "imagining" things, we all do it. Some more than others, but we all do it. It's too hard to just stop thinking about it, and especially difficult for you since you've suffered a loss. Just keep at it and you'll get your BFP soon. Perhaps even this cycle and it will turn out you weren't crazy and imagining things afterall!

I know its tough but I think you guys need to try different ways to get to her...She needs love and acceptance...Make strict rules...Punish her but also remind her that she is loved and that you guys wont give up on her.. Now further more, I wouldnt send her back to her parents because they basically left her on your doorstep and it doesnt sound like they even looked back for her..keep trying cuz she is ten and it is not too late for her to make a lifestyle change..Put her in different organizations and groups in the community to learn discipline (dance, choir, karate, sports, etc)..and then support her in whatever she does...I think that is all she is looking for...I wish you guys the best of luck!!!!!!|`|CPPBqVaaaa	beat her a**.. seriously.. a lil a** kickn never hurt any1.. lol|`|dzyJw0cvaa	Please read the book: Transforming the Difficult Child by Howard Glasser and Jennifer Easly.<br>  <br>  The ten year old girl is acting out because her mom has rejected her.  And with good reason.  She is hurting inside and having a really difficult time.  I swear to you, if you read this book and follow the simple steps, she will be transformed and loveable all over again.  Dont give up on her unless you have tried EVERYTHING you can to make it better.  Get her into counseling.  Take counseling for you and yoru spouse too to get help on what to do.  She is cryng out for help and she will only get worse if she is rejected again.  this situation IS fixable and things can be wonderful between you.  You justhave to roll up your sleeves and be willing to try new things.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! I really hope things get better.
GGH0HVdvaa	How is this a joke...?<br>  <br>  Good writing otherwise|`|qH7IA1Staa	loved it :) u should take her to writing classes were she can expand more on writing and b with pll too.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	ummm.. i dont get it...i thought this was supposed to be a joke??? but otherwise it was an interesting story!!!|`|nZVmkZSBaa	About 5 bushisms were detected... :)|`|3OP1YIXCaa	I like it as a short story.

7QwgAhntaa	You really sound like you are pregnant.  That bleeding could very likely be implantation bleeding.  This is bleeding that occurs when the egg is attaching to the uterus and can often be mistaken for a period.  I suggest you take a pregnancy test.  If it comes out negative wait about 3 days and take another.  If it comes out positive I suggest you got to your local clinic and get a blood test and talk to them about showing results of pregancy.  A blood test will make you 100% of whether or not you are pregnant.  Good luck!|`|yB5go5wbaa	I had that same bleeding the first month of being pregnant...with the rest of your symptoms, it does sound like you're pregnant (esp. the boob thing, that happened to me too).  Take a test; good luck.|`|WelEvYwGaa	Well, you'll probably lost a baby.<br>  <br>  You should go see your doctor though. like Right this minute.
dRd5d6Bgaa	If this spotting is light and didn't last long, you may have had implantation bleeding. If in fact it is that, wait it out another week and then see if your period begins...if it doesn't then take a test. Just don't think about those symptoms and they may disappear. It may be your mind playing games with you...I did that, it was no fun. Good luck!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	It sounds like implantation bleeding!! this is happening to me right now also and i'm just as confused as you are most ppl that have answered my question think its implantation bleeding. wait until you actually miss your period though and take a HPT. good luck!|`|lIeqgtGiaa	i am going through the same thing as you but i dint know wat it is either ... im so confused..i feel that i could be pregnant... but my family is telling me that its just my body changing but im not tryna hear that mess.... go take a blood test that's wat um doing ,,, good luck and keep me up dated..|`|AA11283706	It sounds like what you experienced in implantation bleeding. As well as all your other symptoms seem to point to pregnancy. Breasts may feel a little heavier and be sensitive. The areas around your nipples may also get darker.  Cramping and backaches are also symptoms. Since your period is due now (it is usually 2 weeks after you ovulate) you really should buy a pregnancy test just to make sure. I wish you all the best! I am trying really hard to get pregnant myself, I have been for over a year.

be8738c7b3a936fc2e865b3f0e6ad7d4aa	I went into labor on my own but my contractions got funky towards the end of my labor and I had to have pitocin, so I don't really know what its like to be induced.<br>  <br>  Just because you hemmorhaged last time doesn't mean it will happen again. <br>  <br>  I would be leary of any experimental drug.<br>  <br>  I would only get induced if you go beyond your due date, I don't think you should do it just because the option is there.|`|Hhk78c5Gaa	I think it's irresponsible for a doctor to offer an optionally induced labor. The woman's body was created with a lot of thought and care, and childbirth is something that generally works better without unecessary intervention.|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I am struggling with the question of being induced as well, and I didn't have any of your problems.  With your medical history, it might be better to be induced that way the hospital will be prepared to deal with any issues that may arise.  <br>  <br>  I would trust your doctor's expertise regarding the drug.  Either way, whether you are induced or not, you may still need the drug?  I would rather have the hospital and staff on alert and prepared for anything that may go wrong.  (That is my personal opinion only... not based on any medical knowledge.)<br>  <br>  My problem with induction was a really really long labor that almost resulted in a C-section.  They claim that more induced labors end in C-section than natural labor.|`|AA11661793	I never had a problem when I was induced. Talk to your doctor about your concerns I'm sure he can help to put your mind at ease. Congratulations :-)|`|9QVjNaIPaa	just let nature take its course. i would only be induced if i absolutely had to...
I64JOuMKaa	okiedokes !<br>  i'll start with the hotel party !<br>  <br>  If you have a hotel party, you could rent out 2 hotel suites. One for your parents so that they can keep on eye on you and not spend the night with you in the same room, what fun would that be? LOL . You could invite about like 10ish girls? And tell their parents that it will be supervised so they're more likely to come. You can invite Boys too, but only let the girls sleepover haha . So invite maybe 10 boys and 10 girls that are your sisters friends and maybe one of your friends to keep you company, and first you guys can go to the pool and swim and have fun in the poool.<br>  Afterwards you guys could all go to your hotel room and order food, ROOM SERVICE : ) as much as i've been to hotels, i've never ordered room service in my life LOL.<br>  Rent a movie out and get all the girls around one bed, and the guys on another and watch the movie.<br>  Buy lots of whipping cream, and bubbles and things that will make it fun.<br>  Window markers to right on the mirrors if you want ! Make sure it comes off LOL.<br>  <br>  You guys could whippcream each other or write on the mirrors with whipping cream LOL! you're not gunna clean it up=P but don't make to much of a mess for the people that gotta clean it up !<br>  Anyways, you could play hide and seek on different levels of the hotel and give each like couple a walkie talkie and just go around and act retarded LOL.<br>  <br>  You could blow bubbles from the balcony!<br>  <br>  You could also have maybe a limo party?<br>  Rent a limo and maybe  20 or 15 of her closest friends and bring food and lots of music and turn the music on full blast while the driver drives you around town and roll down your windows and have the time of your life : )<br>  <br>  You could ask the limo to pick you up / drop you off somewhere.<br>  Maybe you guys could go Go-Karting? haha its really funso boys and girls would both enjoy. <br>  <br>  You could also just have a plain dinner party.<br>  Invite a few of her closest friends, and if they want they can all dress up so you can take some pretty pictures later.<br>  You can go to a very expensive restaurant you rarely get to go to , and order whatever you want. Appetizers, Fancy Meals and Fancy Desserts. cheesecake.. creme brulee.. yum : ) ! <br>  <br>  You could also ..<br>  Have a sleepover party! but at your house<br>  You could , invite all the girls, buy a bunch of those facemasks that come in a little pack for a dollar, lots of acetone, nailpolish, handcreams, lotions, cucumbers for the eyes.<br>  <br>  You could buy little buckets to fill with hot water, and each girl can sit on a chair with her feet in hot water while you hire a manicurist to do your guys nails !<br>  <br>  You could also buy a bunch of makeup and just throw it in a tub and girls could pick what they wanted and take some home : )<br>  <br>  you can watch a movie, prank call, talk gossip and stay up all night!<br>  Order pizza ! Play truth or dare ! haha you could also have a scavenger hunt where they have to go around the neighborhood taking pictures of things that are on a list, and whatever group finishes first wins a prize.<br>  <br>  Thats all I can think of atm !<br>  <br>  EDIT ! <br>  <br>  HAHA your welcome : ) ! LMAO isn't it weird? We always go to hotels but we never order room service. That's cause its so pricey! and you know parents, wanna save money and think we don't need it anyways =P
18b18b51bf5cd832259ab262c30adbecaa	well thats good. congrats on not being pregnant lol. it always happens like that...get scared n then when u finally go to the doc it comes down lol.....|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Please don't say Preggers any more.  That is horrible
mFEevGRXaa	no juice yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  The American Dietetic Association says fruit juice offers no nutritional benefits to children younger than six months.<br>  <br>  After six months, pasteurized 100 percent fruit juice (not fruit drink) is an option, as long as your baby doesn’t drink too much of it. Four to six ounces of juice a day are more than enough.<br>  <br>  Offer juice in a small cup at mealtime—not from a bottle, covered cup or juice box, which can promote sipping juice throughout the day. Juice shouldn’t be given in a bedtime bottle.<br>  <br>  Produced by ADA’s Public Relations Team|`|DLDweOcYaa	No juice for baby until he/she is at least 6 months old.  You can buy specific juice for babies aged 6+ months.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	A 3-month-old should only be getting breastmilk or formula unless you have been specifically told otherwise by her doctor.|`|Hz94L5b5aa	Just give them formula or breast milk. Juices and other foods can cause your baby to become allergic. Don't give a child that young water either. They get what they need from the formula or milk.|`|quNfHZULaa	She isn't old enough for juice yet. Only breast milk or formula.
oiJITSNZaa	Don't get up your hopes. These could well be symtpoms of your yeast infection.|`|nwHqblWiaa	Im not sure if a yeast infection is a sign of pregnancy or not--but I do know that when I was pregnant, I had very sore breasts and they were sore under my arms (at the arm pits). If you were pregnant, I doubt you would be feeling any fluttering in your tummy..<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie. Lots of baby dust to youuu!|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	i got a yeast infection at 3 weeks preggo & i had no clue i was pergnant. not sure if it was from pregnancy, but drs say pregnancy can cause it because of hormone levels & discharge. my breasts get sore with each cycle, but when i got pregnant my breasts did not hurt at all. lol.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i had all of those symptoms, infact i rarely get yeast infections and i got one the first few weeks i was pregnant.  those are definatly signs of pregnancy, however they can also be symptoms of PMS, stress etc. so try to stay level headed until you know for sure.  you should be able to take a test pretty soon.  good luck,|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	I've had the cramping.  I just took it as a sign that I strained something- we aren't really trying this month, have BD'd and all that, but I didn't pay attention to the days.  Been tired, but can't sleep.  My cycle started Jan. 31, I know we Danced on the 13, 14, 17, and 19th.<br>  <br>  Good luck, *Baby Dust*|`|PRaTLk8laa	I had the same symptoms as you, minus the yeast infection and I was pregnant.  Best way to find out is get a PG test.  You should be able to find out next week.  Good Luck!
sxZk6njLaa	Wow, you will get a lot of very heated, varied reactions on here. I wouldn't recommend using this alone for help writing your paper.<br>  <br>  I am pro-choice, which means I believe a woman has the right to decide the best way forward for herself and the embryo. If abortion is her choice it doesn't make her a bad person and it certainly isn't murder.<br>  <br>  (However, I do think that people can have abortions far too late on in pregnancy. Surely by a few months you know what's right for you?)<br>  <br>  But everyone has very strong views about this and I'm not even going to attempt to justify mine on here. People can get very angry on this subject and I've come to accept that my own opinion is rock solid, as is the opinion of anti-abortionists - we will never change each others minds. And to be honest, we shouldn't be trying, each for their own I say! <br>  <br>  Good luck with your paper, I say weigh up the key arguments of both pro-choicers and pro-lifers, then in your conclusion go with your own opinion and run with it.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	It is a woman's choice just not mine!<br>  I was almost an aborted baby and my mother changed her mind, there on the table, minutes away from my demise. That hurts me to know she even went that far with it. <br>  There are many reasons a woman can have an abortion. Incest, rape, a high percent chance that neither mom or baby will make it due to medical issues (had a friend with this issue) and other serious reasons. I also know women who seem to use it as a form of birth control and have them all the time as if it is just a regualr procedure. it is the woman's choice but as I said, it will never be my choice. I had my son at 20, got my tubes tied at 21 to prevent me from having kids again becasuse I knew I would not want anymore.<br>  The sad part is, people look down on abortion but doctors (some because mine was awesome) will not let females gettheir tubes tied when they ask for some reason and women who do not know their law in their state ( as I do in mine) will just accept it and continue to have kids or abort them. i cannot say its wrong for a woman to do it, it is there choice as the law says, as crazy as it is to muder their child and that law is disgusting but it is not for me!|`|AA11661793	I think it is wrong. You made the choice to have sex, you took the risk of getting pregnant so once its determined you are you need to take responsibility for your actions. Step up be an adult and take care of the child you created. Its not fair to kill and innocent child because of stupidity. My opinion.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	hey accidents happen but still think adoption and giving th baby a chance is better.....however im getting really pissed off with the ignorance of this world and how people are using abortion as the new birth control or condoms or morning after pill!|`|F12ekJ7Saa	It's a no-no!<br>  <br>  Babies are miracles! Not mistakes!|`|KGRikkJeaa	i dont like it...but i think its the mothers choice. it wouldnt do it tho never, even if i was raped....its not right|`|zBz10IiOaa	this is the 9th question i have seen like this today look it up in the seach questins box and you will get your answer!|`|t4HXotwEaa	I think it's legal and ALWAYS will be.|`|9Xt3UpB1aa	IMO, abortion is murder. I am staunchly pro-life. I know too many people that have had one and regretted it. And not to mention after seeing photos and videos of how it is done, I don't understand how someone can do that. <br>  <br>  I am currently having an unplanned pregnancy. And to me, you did it, your responsible for it, end of story.|`|ckDX1zosaa	I hate the word abortion. People give a person up to 24 weeks to abort but yet a child lived at 21 weeks born. I hear ppl say its a womans body, let her decide. Well that woman had a choice when she laid down. Whatever happens after that is gods choice. I think everyone deserves a chance and a baby for sure deserves a life. Just because you screwed yours up doesnt mean you should mess with a babys life. adoption if you dont like abortion.|`|0upnZ6hSaa	It's murder.  I feel like everyone has the right to CHOOSE to be a mother.  But that choice shouldn't come with killing a life.  If you made a mistake--FINE---give the baby away to a family who is desperately trying to get one.|`|SwyZkNn6aa	If you don't believe in abortion, then don't have one.<br>  <br>  But don't try make laws based on your beliefs that inhibit others from doing what's right for THEM.|`|YSVttvBAaa	Absolutely right. It's a woman's choice what happened to her. You don't know her circumstance. It shouldn't be used as birth control, but as an emergency.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I had one a few years ago and I can honestly say it was the worst mistake I made in my entire life. I spoke to someone I knew about before hand because she had one recently and she felt great...no one ever tells you it is one of the most difficult things you can go through and trust me Ive been through alot...someone could of told me how I would REALLY feel...how much it would hurt me emotionally...how I would live with the regret for the rest of my life...How I will always have the what IF'S about that baby...how it can affect everything after that...I ask god for forgiveness all the time and its been a while I guess I haven't forgiven myself. I had very valid reasons or I thought they were valid enough at the time,but then after you realize there was no reason valid enough in the world. Since my experience am one to be against abortion now because women who want to do it dont know what they are in for they are misinformed and think they will be fine and they wont. Not to mention the paranoia when you do get pregnant because you think something is going to happen to the baby. I use my experience to try to help other women rethink their decisions.|`|uuHPneEcaa	i think abortion is wrong.  Its killing a PERSON that didn't ask to be here. I think its muder! <br>  <br>  like i said its my opinion! some of don't have to agree with me. That is how I think.. <br>  <br>  Think about all those people who are trying have babies and can't the baby that someone just aborted could have gone to a loving and caring family that really wanted it.<br>  <br>  then don't have sex if there is a possiblity u could become pregnant. get on the pill use protection. its the person's fault it happened. now if u get raped it is a totally different story and medical reasons but that should prob be the only time u should have an abortion done. <br>  <br>  I have faced a unplanned pregnancy ALOT of people have! I decided to keep my child. it was my choice to have unprotected sex I could have provented it.. BUT i am not going to say my son is a mistake, I am going to love him no matter what. Abortion was out of the question for me. there is a thing called adoption.  If u didn't want to get pregnant the don't have sex.|`|Od73sfkxaa	I use to think that abortion was completely wrong. I'm not saying that I support it because I personally wouldn't have it done unless I was raped. Even then I am still iffy and it just depends on the circumstances. <br>  <br>  Most people get abortions because they are carless!!! There is condoms, birth control pills, the morning after pill, and so much more. Live up to your mistakes. Most people are looking for an easy way out, instead of trying to live responsibly.<br>  <br>  However, sometimes there is the issue of rape. That is a totally different situation. I use to think that if I was raped, I wouldn't have an abortion, but now that I am married I have to admit I don't feel the same way. I can't even imagine having a child that is not my husband's. There is always the really brutal rapes, where women are not only raped but beaten and tortured beyond recognition. I cannot imagine being raped that severely and then expected to have morning sickness, weight gain, and 9 months of carrying a child for a man who you don't know and wouldn't of had anything to do with except through that horrific act that created the child.<br>  <br>  I believe that each case is different, but regardless God would see it as murder. That is just my personal opinion.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	People can say what they want, until they are faced with an unplanned pregnancy, they do not know what they will do. Abortion is the oldest surgical procedure known to mankind. Making it illegal will not make it stop. Abortion should be safe, legal and rare. There was a really good piece in the NY Times a couple of weeks ago about the lengths women go to in order to terminate unplanned pregnancies, specifically in the Dominican barrios of NYC. You might want to check it out.|`|hZWup7xXaa	i don't think its right at all. people should think before they act. i understand rape victims for wanting one but other than that i dont see why soooooo many people do it. i did a pole in my school to see how many people have had one and about 40% has had at least one. one girl has had 7 so fare and is pregnant again!!  it just upsets me as it does for a lot of people. if you are mature enough to have sex, you are mature enough to have a baby. at least put it up for adoption. so many people cant have babies and would love to adopt. i've been trying to concieve for over 2 and a half years now and it is so upseting thinking of how many babies are being ripped out of the womb just because the person is to selfish to have a baby.|`|dq9uclgpaa	I think killing an innocent child is horrible. I'm a christian and I'm strongly against Abortion.Even if I was raped I wouldn't dare kill a child.

yrx6GxDcaa	babies sometimes will have an allergic reaction to eggs. If that happens, they can't eat eggs for a while most kids outgrow this allergy by age 5 and can eat eggs with no problem after that.<br>   his or her immune system isn't fully developed and can't handle the protein in eggs. Most children who are allergic to eggs are allergic to the protein that's in the egg whites, but some react to the protein in the yolk.<br>  The immune system, which normally protects against germs and other problems, uses antibodies to fight the egg protein like it's a harmful invader. A baby who is allergic to eggs might feel sick or get a rash after eating eggs or any food containing eggs. The reaction could happen fast or it might take a few hours.<br>  Here are symptoms <br>  skin: hives, eczema, flushing, or swelling<br>  digestive system: belly pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, or itching around the mouth<br>  respiratory system: runny nose, wheezing, or difficulty breathing<br>  cardiovascular system: rapid heartbeat, low blood pressure, or heart problems.<br>  In rare cases, a person could have a very serious allergic reaction, which can cause anaphylaxis. Immediate medical attention is needed because the person may have breathing problems and a drop in blood pressure.|`|ay8tXLD2aa	Usually it's the egg whites that babies are allergic to, rather than the yolks.  <br>  <br>  An allergic reaction can affect the respiratory system (trouble breathing), the skin (hives, rashes), the digestive system (nausea, bowel problems) or any combination of the above.  <br>  <br>  It's best to wait until one year to introduce egg whites, and just keep an eye on your daughter for a couple of days when you give them to her, and don't give her anything else new on that day, so that if she does react, you know what it was that caused it. <br>  <br>  I'm sure she'll be fine, don't worry!|`|QAZDPuO9aa	My youngest daughter is allergic eggs. We knew right away that she was because when she ate them she broke out in a red blotchy rash were the eggs touched her skin and she also threw up within hours of eating it. She also developed a rash on her bottom and had a belly ach. I also had her tested for allgeries and we found out that she is allergic to milk, egg and nuts, and alot of food seasons. We knew from the start that she was allergic to milk but i was really relieved that when we found out she had a nut allergy because that is the number one killer in the united states. If you do not feel comfortable feeding her them you could always request that she see an allergin. I hope I was able to answer your question...|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	She should be ok with just the yolk, it's teh whites that cause the allergy. I think you will notice if she is allergic, rash, stool change.<br>  My son hates the yolks.|`|iH2whFkHaa	Green, mucousy stools, possibly with a little blood. Diaper rash particularly around the anus. Unusal fussiness with no apparent cause.<br>  <br>  If the only thing that appears is the fussiness; stop giving her the egg and wait 2 weeks or until the symptom goes away and then introduce a small amount again to see if she reacts.
isRDHbJgaa	Well my cervix is all over the place but after my ovulation after day 7-11 it gets hard and slowly starts to get lower with a little slit and creamy and then I get AF.
HeLrqYMgaa	Clear Blue.... they are a little expensive, but they eliminate the question of "is that a very faint pink line?"  I took one of the cheaper ones every day (I was very excited to get pregnant) and they all came back wrong until my sister in law suggested that one. I was 17 days pregnant and it told me within a minute. <br>  <br>  Unless you have a blood test done, the doctor (or health dept.) will give you the exact same test you can buy at the store.|`|8pl3ShtBaa	You are able to test up to 5 days before a missed period, my recommendation would be that if you test that early you should use your first urine of the day.<br>  <br>  A doctors test is able to test more hormones because it is a blood test. So the doc is always better and more accurate. If available I would go to the doctor.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	The dollar store tests where always correct for me and I got positives before I had missed my period.  If the doctor is just going to give you a urine test then save the time and just go get one from the pharmacy.|`|5N3odm3Qaa	If you have already missed your period then most tests will work. Generally the best are those from the First Response brand. They tout their ability to detect a pregnancy up to 5 days before your missed period, but this is not something to rely upon with much weight. By the way, you don't get pregnant the moment you have unprotected sex. It takes at least a few days for implantation to occur. Then the hormones have to build up to a substantial amount before a home pregnancy test could detect anything. Some women don't accumulate the level needed for a home test to detect for quite some time.<br>  <br>  If you're very anxious and want the best answer available, go to Planned Parenthood and they will give you both blood and urine (if the urine test comes back negative first). It will cost $15 but it can be free if you qualify.
hrint4g1aa	I think that you should start counting the year beginning with when you began having sex regularly again! It is normal for a couple to try for 1-2 years before getting pregnant- but that is regular BDing within that entire span. Good luck!<br>  btw- wow, those are some pretty ridiculous comments left before mine, I guess some people have nothing better to do with their time! :)<br>  <br>  BABY DUST!|`|WnlzScIyaa	the 5 months. since you were probably not having sex on your fetile days.|`|MXduE0Zlaa	OK SO ASK ADULTS ONLY
pGvObBFtaa	Is this the recipe you were looking for?<br>  Ingredients:<br>  1 Cup WHOLE pecans 3 Egg whites<br>  1 Cup sugar 1 tsp. Vinegar<br>  Pinch of salt<br>  You will need:<br>  Wooden spoon Zipper baggie<br>  Bowl Bible<br>  Tape Wax paper<br>  Cookie sheet<br>  Preheat oven to 300 degrees.<br>  <br>  Place pecans in zipper baggie and let children beat them with the wooden spoon to break into small pieces. Explain that after Jesus was arrested, the Roman soldiers beat him. Read John 19:1-3<br>  <br>  Let children smell the vinegar. Put 1 teaspoon into mixing bowl. Explain that when Jesus was thirsty on the cross, He was given vinegar to drink. Read John 19:28-30<br>  <br>  Add egg whites to vinegar. Eggs represent life. Explain that Jesus gave His life to give us life. Read John 10:10-11<br>  <br>  Sprinkle a little salt into each child’s hand. Let them taste it and brush the rest into the bowl. Explain that this represents the salty tears shed by Jesus’ followers, and the bitterness of our own sins. Read Luke 23:27<br>  <br>  So far the ingredients are not very appetizing. Add 1 cup of sugar, a little bit at a time while beating mixture. (See next step.) Explain that the sweetest part of the story is that Jesus died because He loves us. He wants us to know and belong to Him. Read Psalm 34:8 and John 3:16<br>  <br>  Beat with a mixer on high speed for 11 to 15 minutes until stiff peaks are formed. Explain that the color white represents the purity in God’s eyes of those whose sins have been cleansed by Jesus. Read Isaiah 1:18 and John 3:1-3<br>  <br>  Fold in broken nuts. Drop by teaspoon onto waxed paper covered cookie sheet. Explain that each mound represents the rocky tomb where Jesus’ body was laid. Read Matthew 27:65-66<br>  <br>  Put cookie sheet in oven. Close door and turn oven OFF. Give each child a piece of tape and “seal” the oven door. Explain that Jesus’ tomb was sealed. Read Matthew 27:65-66<br>  <br>  Explain that they may feel sad to leave the cookies in the oven overnight. Jesus’ followers were in despair when the tomb was sealed. Read John 16:20 and 22. GO TO BED!!<br>  <br>  On Resurrection morning, open the oven and give everyone a cookie! Notice the cracked surface and take a bite. The cookies are hollow! On the first Resurrection Day, Jesus’ followers were amazed to find the tomb open and empty. Read Matthew 28:1-9<br>  Author Unknown|`|F7i4heAcaa	We always woke up to a trail of jellybeans leading us to our easter basket.|`|E2tW2jA4aa	well. what i do is i hide easter eggs around the house. and he would go running around looking for them. it's safer and you know where he is sometimes i would let him paint eggs. that are boiled already. maybe you should make pancakes shaped as eggs and bunnies.You should maybe give him/her some berries and fruit to let him/her decorate it.it's fun and healthy.i hope this helps you out n____n sometimes.my hubbeh would dress up as a bunny and wake them up.xD he would give each of them a basket and a map.and i would give them cards that have arrows on them and clues so they would find at least 5eggs.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	My dye eggs of coarse but we also make easter basket for other people that might not be able to have them. My kids love doing this. We go pick out stuff and then put it in a easter basket and take it to our local community center.<br>  <br>  We also read the Easter story and I have the "eggs" that have all the religious symbols that tell the story.<br>  <br>  I've never heard of that cookie ting but it sounds really neat
7a57235219ee07bdfd4f569a85d2a3e3aa	The test line HAS to be equally dark or darker then the Control line. Keep trying twice a day to check, cuz you might be ovulating in few days.. And on the safer side, have a reliable OPK, if not satisfied with this one. Cuz you don't want to miss few Golden Days of a month on assumptions and doubts :)|`|yCR6qg0baa	Ovulation tests differ from pregnancy tests in that with a pregnancy test, any 2nd line is a positive. However, on an ovulation test, both lines have to be *EQUAL* thickness/color to be a positive. Then, depending on the test, you will ovulate 12-48 hours later.<br>  <br>  I normally get "faint lines" about 2 days leading up to my dark line. And mine always appears instantly.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	Hi there - I bought a bunch of cheapie ovulation tests, too. They worked fine. I would use them when testing throughout the cycle, then when I got to the cycle days that some of the test strips looked questionable, I used the Clearblue Digital ones that showed the happy face for a positive or the circle for negative. That gave clear confirmation when I was in question. <br>  <br>  Good luck. It'll happen. :-)

If you have sex every day it causes his *** to block things up. If you have sex 2 days before your obligation day and 2 days after you should be good. You dont do it on the day because it takes 2 days for the sperm to travel up there so it has to be done 2 days before the day.|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	Your timing probably is good because the doctors say if you have a regular cycle the four-five days around ovulation you should be able to concieve. If you want to be sure have sex everyday!|`|qwvYLXwCaa	I would just relax and not think about timing.  Sometimes if you stress out it makes it harder to conceive a child.  You two may suprise yourself|`|AvdrrU19aa	mmmm try seeing a doctor this could be serious!!!|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Wyatts mom answered you question well.  Those were the perfect timings.  Everything else now is up to your body.  You could try having sex every day, or every other day during your fertile times.  This can also help.  Good luck!  :)
AaxIZSTwaa	Its hard to say, because the pill is supposed to help regulate periods, but if you went off it early, there is a chance that you could be pregnant, but also a chance that your cycle is just off a little now. I'd give it a couple days and try another pregnancy test. Also, when you took the test, did the control line show up? If it did, the test worked, if it didn't then the test didn't work. Good luck!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	The pill might have thrown your cycle off more than anything, that's what happened to me after I got off the depo. I suggest taking another test in a few days and maybe calling your doctor to see if this is normal. i know when my cycle was going crazy I made an appt. right away and sure enough my doc told me it was the birth control, it usually takes about 3 months to get your cycles back on the right track. good luck!

How it made you feal when they were not honest with her.  Plus as an FBI agent, you will need to have the communication skills to have frank conversations.  Besides your studying - work on your assertiveness now, you will need this to succeed in anytime of military role also.  Plus if you happen to see any role models for these careers in tv shows, just take a look at how those women act.  They dont seem to afraid to assert themselves.|`|EFydPd3Caa	I think that as a young person you should be very proud of yourself that you have such great goals and, don't let anyone no matter who or how much they may mean to you make you think other wise. If it is some thing that you feel is important to you then you should just come out and tell them. If they support you, great, if not then still continue to your goal, b/c what you think and feel truely matter in the end.
btMmriQvaa	We are both feeling the same..|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Getting a BFP on your test means you are pregnant.  Other signs may be due to PMS, flu, hormonal changes, and your crazy desire to be pregnant.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	If you've missed a period I'd say so! with my first child I didn't have any symptoms untill I missed my period and was about 5-6 weeks along. that's when the weird cravings started but i had horrible nausea, and I was very tired I slept most of the day. So if you missed your period you might very well be prego if you havent missed it i'd say take a test on the day you're suppose to get it if you have no period it seems like it can be pregnancy! baby dust !!|`|WnlzScIyaa	If your late then most likely, but if not, alot of times period signs and pregnancy signs are similar.

IkkYOehSaa	I went back to work when my daughter was 8 weeks, she is now almost 11 months and still breastfeeding. I had an ideal situation. I was able to pump every two hours at first and then only had to pump on my lunch break as she got older. Now I don't have to pump at all. You place of work legally has to provide you with a private room to pump and and plenty of time to pump. If you pump on a schedule then you probably wont have to worry about let down. If you don't pump though you will probably loose your milk. Or your production will severely decrease. And you will not produce as much milk during the time that you have those working hours, even when you're not working. Your breasts work on a schedule. The more you use them the more milk you have, and same goes with the less you use them. <br>  I'd say that it a big commitment to breastfeed full time and work. and it can be very hard. But if you really want to do it then fight hard to do so. But remember your rights, you are allowed by law to have the time and resources (private room) to be able to pump while you are at work. And don't let anyone make you feel guilty for doing it, your child deserves this and so do you, who cares what others think.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	Your job is required by law to provide a safe, private place for you to pump. Do some research into that, and if anyone tells you you can't pump then you can definitely sue.<br>  <br>  If you're working an 11 hour shift and don't pump or feed *at all* during that period, your boobs will become engorged and painful. Especially if you breasfteed full time the rest of the time.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to pump at work, you can slowly wean your child to where you're only nursing once or twice a day, well before you leave for work. Your breasts will adjust eventually, but you'll definitely have to switch to a bottle for the remaining feedings. Good luck!|`|NAzAmFDnaa	Trust me, you will be screaming for your baby or a pump after 11+ hours.  Your boobs will be rock hard from milk and will leak.  If you plan to continue breastfeeding and work, you'll have to pump at work.  Even if you take a hand held pump and pump in your car on your lunch break.  They also make pumps that plug into your car cigg lighter.  11 hours is way too long to not nurse or pump and your milk will start to dry up.  Are you sure you can't pump at work?  Lots of women do.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	As long as you can pump at least once during your shift, you can still keep up your milk supply.  It may drop a little, but if you  continue to nurse your baby all day when you are off work, you can make it work.  I went back to work when my baby was 3 months, and I only got to pump twice during the day for the first few months, and it was only 5 minutes to pump each time.  Then I dropped down to one pumping session, so I could have a little longer time.  I'm just now weaning my baby at 10 months.  We were able to keep up exclusively breastfeeding until recently.|`|avx7bLnKaa	you will need to pump at work at least 3-4 times<br>  <br>  but you can also start pumping now and freeze the milk so your baby gets breastmilk longer<br>  <br>  you can also give formula to the baby's care provider during the day and still nurse before and after work... although you will eventually dry up sooner|`|uMIvRRjoaa	<a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bf-links-pumping.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/bf-li...</a><br>  <br>  Legally they have to provide you with breaks (lunch and two short ones). IF they won't I'd be looking for a new job- that's just inhumane! And if you can't pump in your workplace some electric pumps have car adapters you can use, or you can use a manual one. (Electric is better and works faster). Doctors are able to bf and work- and they have long shifts too, so you could make it work if you want.|`|7zG27bSPaa	thats only if ur baby will even take a bottle i was giving my baby both and after 2 mths she learn the difference and screames every time we give her a bottle i dont even have the option of bottle i have to come home every 2 hrs to feed her.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Yes.  Your body makes milk according to the demand.  If you stop feeding for 11 hours at a time, the body will stop making milk.  Also, your breasts make milk more efficiently when they are empty.  In other words, the more you empty them, the more you make...and your situation does not seem conducive to that. To work 11 hours at a time, you would need to pump probably 3-4 times.  <br>  <br>  I DID pump at work.  Once I went full-time, I could not keep up my supply enough to exclusively breastfeed and it was very very very hard for me.  I am not sure why you feel you cannot, but many people I know find that their work environments are supportive. <br>  <br>  When you have your little one (congrats, btw!)  nurse as often as possible, and once your milk comes in, start pumping!  That way you can build up a freezer store to feed your baby and to get him/her used to the bottle.<br>  <br>  Once I started working, my baby and I would have a nurse-fest when we got home!  We would nurse for hours at a time, with only a few short breaks. I didnt care though, I loved it.  I would have rather been home with baby, but had to do the responsible thing for my family.  (give me a thumbs down!  I am proud of myself AND my family!)<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW contrary to the above post, most states do NOT require employers to provide a pumping station.  California does.  My state, NJ, does not, but a bill is pending in the state senate.  This is something moms should lobby their congresspeople about!  Fortunately, my boss was accommodating and I had a good place to pump.
7PpjxfZ9aa	Even though raising a child is hard at times, it's the most beautiful, amazing gift you could ever receive. my advice is just don't neglect him, comfort him, love him with all of your soul, sing him to sleep, talk to him, let him know you care and you are there whenever he needs you. Maternal instincts will definitely kick in. Babies are such a blessing. However, there will be rough times when you want to cry, pull your hair, or just scream, but it's all worth it as he gets older and older and he changes more and more and knows that you are his mother. He already loves you with all of his heart. It's that simple. Congratulations!!!!!|`|WCDaIP2Yaa	Congradulations!!!!!!!!  I am pregnant with my third and I already have a 14 year old daughter and an 18 year old son.  Might I add I am pretty xperienced in that area.  lol  Anyways, I highly recommend that you read to him, sing songs with him, and play with him as much as possible.  That helps his mind to develop to his highest potential.  Also, you might have to keep the baby in your room so you will hear him cry at night when he wakes up.  I also agree that breast feeding is the healthiest way to feed your baby at that age as long as your healthy.  Make sure you just focus on YOU AND THE BABY.  Don't foret about your surroundings, but make sure you build an everlasting bond and worry about his health.  Make sure you bathe him morning and night, maybe even three times a day.  Keep in mind that you will need to use a delicate baby soap.  Hmmm always have a positive attitude towards him.  Be sure that he has that innisant happy look for at least six years lol.  Try to be the best mother you can be.  You can also teach him how to wave, talk to him, say his name around him a lot, and also when you guys are listening to music together, you could take his hands and clap them to the beat.  There's so many nice things that you can do with your little bundle of joy.  <br>  Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WThYT17Iaa	Congrats. That is so exciting. My son is turning one soon and I can't believe it. I want to cry just thinking how fast the past year has gone by. The best advice that I can give you is to talk to him. It sounds absurd but my son loves it and I think it has made him a very happy baby. Also, don't be afraid to be goofy or silly with him. My son has the coolest personality and is so funny. For example, he has recently learned to say UH OH. He will drop something and then say uh oh and look at me, expecting me to pick it up (because I always do). Make the best of the time. It goes by so fast. You are so lucky.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	yay congrats!  really it is just second nature it all just seems to come to you once you have that baby!  it might get a little stressful sometimes just because of course your little one depends on you for everything make sure you take some "YOU" time every now and again so you don't get overwhelmed!  good luck im sure you'll do great!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	People will try and tell u how to be a parent i suggest u Just go with your gut!! some input is ok if u want to hear it...Put ur baby on a schedule...if you need five minutes to ur self then take it put the baby in the crib walk out of the room and just breath...its ok for ur baby to cry for a lil...o yes and lots and lots of love...babies are simple they like simple things u can do the stupidest thing and they will laugh...Sleep when he sleeps!!!!...You cannot spoil a newborn no matter what anyone says...once they start realizing things around 4 months or so then its different...Good Luck!!!!|`|GBHVkElWaa	Well I just had my first boy (have a 1 year old girl).

It's wonderful, exhausting and incredibly rewarding!<br>  <br>  And take lots of photos. :)|`|AA10672842	Congratulations on your new son.I agree that you should trust your own instincts when it comes to raising your son.most things are common sense. The only thing I can suggest is don't try to be super mom.If you don't get the dusting don, don't fret.Take a nap when the baby is resting  so you can recharge your batteries.A newborn means that many things in your life will change and as overwhelming as it may seem  at times you will look back on it as the best time of your life.As for grandparents  and friends , they may try to give you lots of advice.Just thank them for their input.Nothing says you have to follow it but once in awhile they may come up with a gem. Take photos when you can.Enjoy each day.Take care.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	Enjoy your baby now while he's still a baby-He will grow up so fast.

9TWN2pF1aa	first of all you shouldnt have to talk about this online second of all if your to young so how old are you? Third of all you shouldnt take plan b it does mess up your cycle but dont worry it wears off it happened to me before but when you have your cycle just remember this it might look a little weird at first the blood so dont worry its normal just dont have sex for a little while k? Oh and the negitavie thing dont worry about it it does that if your to young, using the wrong type for your blood, or if you had sex when you where under the age of 14.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	I think it just messed up your cycle. If you took the Plan B correctly you should be fine. Give it another two weeks try not to stress too much. Then if not period still take another test. Good Luck|`|lSiv5PDlaa	ive had the same delima once the plan b, if you took it in the right time span that is, should have ended all worry! all you can do is wait and see for a few weeks, BUT I WOULDNT STRESS! its probally nothing!|`|rSxSV6tfaa	There is no way you should be pregnant after taking a Plan B but it could happen. I would not worry i think maybe it is just a side effect. But wait i remember on the commercial it said after taking plan b if you are a week late on your period you could be pregnant. I would just see a doctor.<br>  <br>  I looked online for a number for plan b and you can call this number and ask if its normal and see what they think 1-800-330-1271.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|0UPvxzkxaa	it may turn out to be a waste of money if your not pregnant but that's the only way to tell for sure, pregnancy test can give false negatives even if pregnant but never false positives! and yes you could be pregnant,|`|SUT3yL0oaa	I would assume that its just a hormonal imbalance from taking the plan b pill. I'd wait at least another week or 2 and if your period doesn't arrive I'd test again. If it still doesn't arrive I'd call your dr for an exam.
wZAeBisbaa	Why not ask the doctors instead of us?  I do know that having a broken bone pinned can cause some loss of flexibility - it happened to me.  But with a lot of physical therapy and exercise, I eventually recovered almost all of my range of motion and strength.  It took quite a while to get back to normal - more than 2-3 months - and I worked at it pretty faithfully.  Your daughter may just need more exercise and therapy. If that doesn't work, there are probably other things an orthopedic surgeon could do - but as I said, they would be the best persons to ask.|`|aQ9hXCU1aa	Amputate.

And she had "two" surgeries, not "to". Correct again? Last but not least, "Since" they have removed the pin and not "sense", correct again?|`|rpsXPdFmaa	They might do more therapy and encourage her to work with it.  I think last resort would be rebreaking it and resetting it.  I'm not sure, I'll have to ask my husband when he gets home.
6sJhoXAAaa	Make sure she has 3 solid feedings a day spaced out evenly.<br>  <br>  How much sleep she needs overnight and what time you have to get up in the morning determine when she has to be asleep.  If you have to get her up at 7 AM, she should be sleeping by 7 PM.|`|BMfn0D9gaa	My daughter is 7 months old and goes to bed between 8:00-8:30pm and sleeps until about 6:30, I then feed her a bottle and she is out again until 8:30-9:00am.  Just keep putting her to bed at the same time each night and eventually she will realize that is her bedtime.  When she wakes up a few hours later I would just leave her in her crib.  If you keep getting her out of bed she is going to think it is okay to get up and play every night.|`|DhmUgq0maa	If in the late afternoon you keep her active...get down on the floor an play with her for an hour, take her for a walk etc... then you will wear her out and you'll find that after bath an a bottle she just crashes.<br>  <br>  I read a study the other day that said if you put your baby to bed for the night at 7pm then they are more likely to sleep through the night without waking....works with my 8 months old, you just have to make sure you do enough with her through the day to wear her out to the point that she is exhausted by 6 or 7 pm.|`|HGqmsaM5aa	my daugther's 3 months old and is asleep normally by 9:30 and sleeping until 7:30-8.

Practice makes perfect.  I started my son on a schedule as soon as he was born (he is now 8 mos.) and he started sleeping through the night at 9 weeks (and is still a breastfed only baby).  Pick up the book and let it be your guide.  I swear by it.  <br>  Here is what I did.  At 9 weeks, he went from 10:30 pm to 6:30 am.  Then at about 4 mos. I just started putting him down a little bit earlier each night, like 20 minutes, and then he started sleeping from 9pm to 9 am.  At like 6 months, I cut out his evening nap and he started sleeping from 8 pm to 9 am.  <br>  Put your baby on a schedule and just keep working at it.  A happy baby makes happy parents.   Its very important to us because how happy would you be if you woke up a bunch of times at night.  <br>  Don't give up and read the book!|`|HQf3QPUMaa	My 7 month old is exhausted and ready for bed by 7:30.  But then again, what do I know.  I just asked a question begging for help because I am desperate for sleep, lol.  <br>  If you find the magic number, please let me know!!
X5e1h6Uzaa	It sounds like you've answered your own question:  let her cry it out.  I would start by letting her cry through the first spell, then going to her the second time and giving her a bottle/breast feeding.  Start slowly and build up to only one night time feeding.  I never put my daughter in bed with me, but I know that some parents are advocates of co-sleeping when done properly.  It may be worth getting a co-sleeper until you get past this stage.  I know it's hard to let her cry it out, but you have to get used to the crying some time.  Believe me, it's just as hard when they're 2 as when they're 7 months.  Good luck!|`|AA11599282	Oh, Spanks, I have been wanting to tell you this since your last question, but you seemed so against it.  It's time to let the baby cry.  Our baby's are about the same age, she might need to eat one time in the night.....4ish is what I do.  When she wakes up anytime before that, you go in, give a paci (if you use it) rub her head for a second and tell her good night.  Then do the Ferber method, go in after 5 minutes, then if she's still crying, 10 minutes, then if she's still crying, 20, then 20 then 20 til she's asleep.  It works.  Then, do the same thing the next time.  She'll get the point really quick and it will only last two or three nights.  You will help to teach her the lifelong need of learning to fall asleep on her own.  Look it up in the book, "What to Expect, the First Year" they have a nice method in there for crying it out.  I did it to my baby last month, who was waking up 4-5 times too....now, it's once...4:45 (on the dot, the little stinker)  Email me if you have any more questions.

kIad9ffRaa	Have your two year old help you out around the house. Picking up toys, folding laundry, dusting or wiping down the furniture. My one and a half year old will (on her own, mind you) take a tissue or Kleenex and start dusting the furniture. It is hilarious. One time she snatched the window cleaning rag and went over what my wife had done! So, put your kid to work a little. It will teach them to be tidy and organized. And, give the two year old something for helping you like a cookie and milk or something as a thank you for his/her help. Trust me, it will get easier!
3CVfUiiJaa	My 9 month old does this.  He has been doing it since he turned 6.5 months or so.  I asked my doctor about it and he said that it is a "new" thing that my son has learned and will probably do it for awhile.  my husband was concerned, but I was not.  He does it, but not crazy like he used to.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Almost every baby I have ever known does this.  My son used to do it from time to time as well.|`|IA1irLy7aa	my son does a similar thing except he does a thing that almost looks like a shiver as if he is cold he even does it when he is hot i have asked his doctor about it as i was quite concerned as well the doctor said i have nothing to worry about. as for the shaking head my son also does the exact thing only when he is tired or teething it is the baby's way of distracting themselves from the pain or trying not to fall asleep. hope i helped.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	My 8 month old son shakes his head when I put him in his crib and he's tired. He'll shake his head for a minute or two then drift off to sleep. Sometimes during the day he'll shake his head no at us. We just laugh and shake our heads no back. I wasn't aware that could even be a problem though. I'm all nervous now.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I think my baby does the same thing!  It almost looks like he has a chill!  Today my mom was here and said she thought he was choking...I knew he wasnt...thanks, mom...she just panics now that I give him chunks of food (10 months).  I am sure I am not helping you, but you helped me, because it never really bothered me before.  But I notice it mostly when he is in the highchair.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	nope mine does it too but now he does it when i ask him a question|`|JWwrXBpAaa	It can be neurological...but mainly leans towards "headbanging"-- check out the book "the baby whisperer"...info in there. good luck.
hVrfm4eIaa	Initials aren't really that important.  They don't come up very often anyway.  I grew up with the initials "B.O." and (although I did hear a couple snickers from time to time) I did just fine.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I am assuming there will be a middle name which will nullify your concerns re: initials!|`|IU4uNH97aa	if you love the name then go for it how many times in her life are people going to pick out her initials. Alot of people wouldn't notice until you or her point it out so i dont think its a big problem. If you love the name then go for it ! I think Eliana is very cute. Plus she will have a middle name initial in there it .<br>  <br>  There are worst initials out there so EZ isn't that bad. I know a little boy and his initials are P.M.S and its a boy ! or a little girl in the hospital that was born HIV positive has the initials S.T.D. But some people have really cool initials too. My nephew Zac has the initials Z.A.C. i thought it was pretty cool.|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	It's really up to you... I don't think it would be the most horrible thing in the world.

I know someone whose name is Benjamin Robert Arrinson: initials are BRA.|`|DP48dIxhaa	Well as long as the middle name is okk then it wont be a problem|`|1V66syCkaa	I don't think initials are that big of a deal.

1K12BOMKaa	Try some of the recipes here.  If food doesn't interest you then maybe you need to just change what you are eating.  Try cooking new things with different smells.  I remember when my wife was pregnant she suddenly couldn't stand many of the foods she use to eat all the time.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I am not vegetarian, but I loved to cook as well, and when I became pregnant the smells were so strong that it made it hard to want to even eat at the beginning.  I instead had my husband cook, and also did some grilling out.   You can grill potatos and veggies packets of all sorts.  <br>  <br>  Make sure you eat some nuts on occasion for protein, and also eat plenty of greens such as broccoli, asparagus, and green beans to insure adequate iron.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats.  <br>  <br>  And the smell thing, does seem to lessen as you get into the second trimester.|`|18b18b51bf5cd832259ab262c30adbecaa	i dont have the recipe for it but my friend made spinach quiche once. it was so good.

Compromise with her and make a deal. Say you can skip blank amount of days and if you don't like that than you can move out. If she doesn't respect your rules then she shouldn't be able to in your house. If she thinks she's good enough to skip school then she should be able to support herself. My mom did the same thing with my brother when he was about 17 or 18. She gave him a choice. Follow my rules or don't live in my house. I think the main thing you need to do in all of this is to make sure she knows you love her. Whatever happens, your daughter will grow up sometime.

She just needs to learn a lesson. Take it from someone who did.|`|yKS2UI87aa	My rule is you are either in school or have a FT job. I would also make her help pay back the fine. If she will listen explain if she doesn't go to school and drops out she will never have a good paying job, will not be able to afford nice clothes etc. You can also try PINS which is a program for at risk teens, it's like probation. Call the probation dept to find out more. I'm sorry she doesn't seem to realize how much you care. Keep trying some teens (like I was) are hard headed.
hDlmZ8zUaa	Wait a week.  If you don't start, take another test.  If it is still negative, got to the doctor.  Make sure the next test you take is first thing in the morning when the hcg  level will be highest.  I got a negative result with the first test I took because I miscalculated my cycle.  I started getting sick and I still hadn't started so I took another test and it was positive.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|cfdooGylaa	For some people it takes awhile for a positive to show up. My advice would be to go to a doctor to get a blood test which is way more accurate and sensitive than the home pregnancy test. Good luck!|`|kUCVLuTPaa	wait another 8 days and take another one|`|C8E3fe3xaa	You could still be pregnant, wait a week and take another test. If you get a negative again and still feel you are pregnant..make a doctor appointment to get a blood test done. Then you can know for sure. Good luck!|`|JuWL7T0Haa	girl I took like 5 tests before mine showed up positive.  wait like a week and than take another test.  it seems to me like you are preggers!  i think i was a little over 2 weeks late before it showed up +|`|VRSUyeqbaa	maybe, maybe not. wait a week as your hormone levels double every other day.<br>  <br>  lots of luck and baby dust
MXXOICquaa	i know exactly what ur going through every since the middle of the 2nd trimester my teeth and mouth and gums have hurt take tylenol thats all u can take unfortunately, laying on a heating pad or using a hot wet wash cloth pressed up against ur mouth helps, taking extra calcium helps because ur teeth need to be as strong as possible and the baby is getting ur calcium, swishing warm salt water and try some ambesol because i used oragel and it relieved the pain for a little bit then i got used to it and it didnt help anymore so i switched to ambesol until i got used to it then back to oragel good luck maybe your pain wont last as long as mine|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	rinse with warm salt water, thats about all you can do =( srry, i know how horrible tooth pain feels, idk why they even make tylenol it dosent work =(|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Tylenol is safe during pregnancy. That's what I'm taking for some severe tooth pain, too. Just remember to stay away from Advil and Ibuprofen related products.|`|ayT6fuD4aa	oOo qosh I know what you're qoinq throuqh ; when I qot about 17 weeks I had a horribleee tooth ache ; but I always took tylenol && qarqled warm salt water, it's best to take a tylenol riqht before yhu qo to sleep, that usually helps, and keep a warm cloth on the side where it hurts. I'm sorry yhu have to qo throuqh this, I know how it feels its the WORST feelinq in the world, especially on top of beinq preqnant. Good luck ?|`|qJaKF24naa	Depends on the doc... I would try garggling salt water that may help the pain. My sister in law when she was pregnant had a root canacl and her doc okayed vicodin! But I wouldnt never take that.. I think maybe suffering it out a couple days is best... Espiecially since so early in your pregnancy.  She was more towards the end when she had hers so that might have made a difference.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	not unless your doc can think of something stronger thats not harmful. mine only recommended regular strength tylenol for my very severe back pain that i took vicodin for before i got pregnant.

In that case just make sure your provider understands that you want complete confidentiality.|`|0UPvxzkxaa	NO i don't think they will blatantly lie for you, but they cant tell your parents anything without your permission any way! just insist they wait outside your 18yrs old!<br>  if the problem is minor and something you don't want them to know tell them there isn't anything wrong its just your menstrual cycle playing up! obviously you have ur reasons for not wanting them to know but it may turn out to be something you can share with them.. its a shame u cant confide in them either way|`|WU3iVaa0aa	I have asked a doctor to do this recently..

There are better (and more effective) ways of keeping a boyfriend than to bring an innocent child into the mix.

He is probably going to be a big boy...are you and your hubby tall?|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Sounds pretty normal to me.|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	Yes it sounds very normal and to be honest what you may need to do is to put a teaspoon of baby cereal in a bottle because that milk now a days is not enough to fill a baby, i mean would it be enough to fill you? That's probably why the baby is waking up so often looking to eat again because that was not enough. And a doctor will tell you that it is not the right thing to do, but take it from a mother of two....it works.|`|mFEevGRXaa	sounds normal every 2 to 3 hours is usually how often a baby at that age will eat. the bigger they get the more they will want and then more hours will go by until they are hungry again|`|TvYX1yXWaa	yeah its normal i was wondering the same thing and i asked his doc...|`|JuWL7T0Haa	lol u've got a little piggy!  he sounds like he's right on track to me!
nzGdMWbZaa	Have intercourse the day before ovulation:)|`|AA11764194	I always conceived on 14 to 16th day from first day of my period and ended up with Boys.. so may be you also try to do that..|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i was always told have sex before yout ovalation occurs,,, ,,,well it work for me    2 lovly boys   ,, then i had sex atfer ovalation  and ha d a girl,,,,|`|MMF1YmZZaa	Oh, this was the question for me! I have been researching this and this is what I can tell you!<br>  <br>  You should first know when you ovulate. Have sex the day that you do. This is why: sperm that carry the x chromosome will conceive a girl. These sperm are bigger and live longer then the male sperm. Sperm that carry the y chromosome with conceive a boy. There are typically more of them and they are much faster then the female sperm, but have a shorter life span. So, you should only have unprotected sex on the day and days after you ovulate so that the faster sperm are getting to the egg quicker. If you have sex lets say three days before you ovulate then the sperm will still be alive in your body and just waiting for the egg to come out, but it will mostly only be the female sperm because they live longer. Make sense? You can google how to know.<br>  <br>  Next, you need to go to the health-food store and purchase ph level test strips. The ph levels in your vagina will greatly determine what sex your baby is. An acidic ph level favors a girl and an alkaline ph level will favor a boy. I read that scientists say if your ph levels are highly alkaline there is a 90% chance that you will only conceive boys, and vise versa for girls. You can change and adjust your ph levels by your diet and by taking supplements. Also by douching with a baking soda douche, but this is not recommended because douching can be dangerous. The reason for this is a highly acidic vagina will kill off the male sperm quickly, where a highly alkaline vagina provides a better environment. <br>  <br>  Sexual positions are important, for a boy a deep sexual position is the way to go! Doggystyle (eh, I hate that name lol) and a twist on the standard missionary where your partner pushes your legs up and is very far into you are the best. Girl on top is not recommended. This puts the sperm right up to your cervix, which means less time in your possibly highly acidic vagina lol.<br>  <br>  Men have to do some work too, so tell daddy to get to it! I read that they need to wear loose fitting underwear and try to keep their testicles are cool as possible. Heat kills sperm, and the male sperm are even more fragile. Also, avoid alcohol before sex as this slow sperm down (ha sounds like men too). Tell him to drink some coffee or have caffeine before sex as this makes the sperm more mobile as well. Also, zinc vitamins raise the testosterone levels which raises sperm levels. <br>  <br>  Also, just for fun, google the chinese ovulation chart and see what months it tells you to conceive! Make sure you read it carefully because I just realized you have to convert your age as well and I didn't realize that.<br>  <br>  Well, I hope this helped! Good luck to you I hope it works! I want a baby boy so bad, I'm going to do every one of these things when I try to conceive! <br>  <br>  Google how to conceive a baby boy and you will get tons of info!|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Here you go.

We use it as a learning experience to do better. BUT, and this is a big but, we don't get depressed by it. We learn to laugh at our mistakes and move on. We share grades with our close friends. We have no problem letting people know. It isn't COOL but it's an open topic. Grades are talked about almost as much as what someone is doing this weekend. I guess my school is just more relaxed because we feel like a family.|`|pOZubuOcaa	In my school some kids consider it COOL<br>  which is completely stupid I'm Failing Chemistry and i don't find anything cool about it<br>  <br>  I also hate when girls act dumb for some reasons the girls at my school like to be dumb by making dumb comments and questions on purpose|`|AA10411777	Its easier to not try and fail and laugh about it then to try really hard and fail and be laughed at. When kids get behind on there studies they just give up|`|5i1J2RLLaa	If you fail on a test or a report card for some reason kids think it's hilarious. I don't know why! If I got a bad grade like that I would hang my head in shame. The most popular kids get the worst grades. There was this one girl (most popular girl in school) I called her "Hollister Girl" b/c all she would wear was Hollister and she failed every class and stayed back, and her parents, friends, even she didn't care.<br>  <br>  Crazy World we live in.|`|R10oqvHyaa	OMG I KNOW<br>  In my school it's so not cool to be smart. Im not gunna brag but im pretty smart. I have all 97's or above for my class averages.<br>  So when my friends get liek a 75 they are all happy and there like what did you get and Im like a 100 and there like SUCK Up. <br>  Im like no not reli.....<br>  <br>  I think people do it just becuase they think it proves that they have better things to do than school. or "To Cool For School" <br>  <br>  hmmmm?|`|9KE4dvmkaa	lower education and people in lower class areas think its cool because they want someone to be on the same grade level with if they're failing too.|`|cFfPVj9caa	its cool and funny becuz of the reason they fail<br>  like they were too high to think straight<br>  or they thinking of bein at the next hott party duing test or something<br>  or they had a bad hang over|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Because it's like your cool and you don't care about anything, you do what you want lol.|`|1e7ef5bc5381f36fcc4da6e6df2b284faa	It is never cool to fail and be dumb! Are you dumb? You must be soooooo coooool duuude!|`|Foi6PFWQaa	It's not cool in my school either.|`|GAvwDkVnaa	its like that in my school if your dumb your so called cool. Its dumb to|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	huh ?
Fkl6gV8Qaa	Very, you can't usually even get a heartbeat until 12 weeks so other then take blood tests there is nothing they can do until then anyways.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Yep it's normal..my doctor does the same thing. There isn't really much the doctor can do until after that time.|`|GCPbKg9Eaa	normal for lots of places. I am not getting in till 12 weeks either and the first and only ultrasound I get is at 20 weeks.<br>  My first babys prenatal was in another province and the prenatal there was totally different.<br>  I perfer my old provinces prenatal care. but what can I do?|`|qgJLZPDJaa	totally :) mine was at 8 weeks i believe...and that was really to early to do anything. they basically just explained the basics and then at 12 weeks i was given a sonogram. you will also have to give blood work if you havent yet.|`|0UPvxzkxaa	yes this is right i went for my 1st scan at 7 weeks this was because i didn't know how far gone i was, but they cant pick much up so i went back at 12weeks, they cant detect every thing then heartbeat ETC|`|Foi6PFWQaa	Yeah the hospital I go to won't do anything for you until you're 12 weeks along either.|`|E7R7D1onaa	Docs. usually won't even take you until ur about 9 weeks anyway... and it also depends on if they can fit u in... my sister-inlaw had to wait longer than that so ur pretty lucky.... Gud luck and i hope all goes well...|`|wLhcRPUOaa	Yes this is normal for alot of places. That is when the miscarriage rates go down and when they can first hear heartbeat on a dopler and what not.
oDGpmkMaaa	Do you have a teething ring? you know the one that goes in the Freezer my kids loved them. Also the teething pacifiers they freeze had stay cold. it great for that teething time. Once you start to see a tooth I would use baby oral gel (ask your doctor first) and teething tabs (ditto). <br>  <br>  Good luck teething can be hell<br>  <br>  <br>  edit* here's some links to those pacifers<br>  <a href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.do?product_id=8832437" rel="nofollow">http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...</a>|`|6AvVVzsnaa	It depends on the baby. Mine's started teething at 3 months and it came in at 6 months. But teething rings or put a wet clean cloth in the freezer and let him bite on that.

CIUAIxXaaa	If I were you, I would call him. That way you don't have to go to his locker and slip a note in there, all you have to do is call him and explain your feelings.   I think it would be pretty hard to explain your feelings and how you feel about y'all being best friends again hard in person-2-person(I don't think anybody would do that in reality)..A text wouldn't be stupid, its just something I wouldn't do because, if you really want to be back friends with him, I think he should be able to hear your voice and express your feelings to him. A text isn't "Stupid"..I'm just saying if I wanted to be back friends with someone, I wouldn't do it through a text. I recently went through something like this. You have to remember that friends come and go and as you grow up you find out who your "real" friends are...Its really hard to see a ex-best friend with somebody else and knowing that they arent there for you..<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luc and I hope you guys become friends again!|`|XrKviWgSaa	i say write him a letter and put it in his locker, its personal but you don't have to do it face to face, just tell him that you miss your friendship and you would like to try and fix it.|`|NYJgiVxraa	yes it always can be with ur best friend. a big fite happeend between me and her 3-4 years ago. eventually, her mom and my mom talked it out and then she came up to me and admitted that she was sorry for making me feel more lieft out  i think and i told her it was my fault, and tha tshe taught me a lesson to b more sociable with other people. and i became a better person.|`|r9zIGWf8aa	if u really want to deal with him, then just clench up and ask for a private conversation.<br>  but wat i think u shud do is just forget about it.<br>  ive gone thru a ton of girls that i thought i felt really deeply for, and everytime i felt depressed about them, i never got around to facing them<br>  but after awhile that feeling wud go away and move to a different person.<br>  so it just comes and goes. must b just hormones for me<br>  dunno if its the same 4 u tho. cuz im a guy
876e05e5fb4225d5d27c03023eb578b5aa	eh...don't worry about it...if you don't like him anymore...why should you worry????  if you want to then you can explain to him but like you said...he probably won't believe you...so just let it go...let people believe what they want to...at least you know that it's not true...that's all that matters :)|`|NBo2ucWsaa	Yeah, it'll be awkward, but look at it this way. He's a guy... and you sound as if you're in middle school, probably a little more intelligent among your group. Let the "children" be childish. Anyone who says that you like him, look at them, and very firm, say, "I don't like him." If they say something like "you're denying the truth," then just laugh it off. Let them believe what they want.<br>  Tell anyone who claims that it's true that they're no better than the person who started it. This girl obviously wanted to screw with you.|`|fJichSMhaa	if anyone asks u about it just pretend that u don't know what their talking about and maybe u can just try to avoid the boy for a couple of days and  everyone will forget about it and move on or u can tell the boy that it was a mistake or something that people just decided to start this rumor that u like him and its not true|`|ZZke7c1Saa	tell the truth just dnt hur his feelings|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i had a friend named judy thats wierd<br>  i would say take it in stride<br>  if you actually still like him i would say that you should just use it as an oppotunity to start a conversation, but since you don't its a little awkward<br>  if he asks you i don;t think it would be good to lie and maybe just tell him the truth<br>  it might be wierd but it will resolve a  few things<br>  <br>  you cant really change peoples perceptions that much, so i would say dont let it get to you<br>  if yo uact like it bothers you they'll derive more entertainment from you<br>  if you don't they;ll get bored and stop eventually|`|HOdblqIkaa	blow it off. if it was an old crush then theres nothing to worry about. if someone says something about it say its just a rumor and your not interested in him. dont play it up and make it into more than it is because thatll really get people talking.
IurAMoIDaa	i think you should contact your doctor, as we are not health care professionals who can help you! these questions you ask a lot on here you should be telling your doctor! not some random Joe's! i would hate to think someone giving you the wrong advice and you following it, so please go and see your doctor instead of waiting for someone to reply to your question on here!
txG1hqV4aa	HA!  I can't help but laugh at you're situation<br>  <br>  I get freaking yelled at and my phone taken away for a B.  Jeez, if I get a grade lower than THAT, ohhBoyy. I wouldn't See the outside world for at least 3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Consider yourself lucky.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Your mother does not hate you..she is very upset that you are not doing very well in school...Yes she told you to be more sociable but she also wanted you to get your work done...She is just being a good parent...Not too many kids have the luxary of having caring parents..Thank God for the one you got cuz she wants you to succeed!!!|`|HOdblqIkaa	no she doesnt hate you <br>  but maybe you need to be a bit more responsible and get your grades up<br>  shes just upset because your close to failing|`|gA22md42aa	she wants the best for you and she expects the best from you.  If she hates  you she wouldn't care about your grades.<br>  <br>  So no she doesn't hate you.<br>  <br>  Do better in school.  She was nice and smiling around other people but she really was embarrassed.  Beat you? um beat  the sense into you maybe.  AT school your educational image is her image too.|`|1enIWBGnaa	YOU are in school for an education - NOT to be cool!!!<br>  Get your head out of your butt and focus on your education and your future.  Being 'cool' does NOT get you a job!|`|ywlhky4uaa	They say theres no such thing a stupid question , but yes, this is a stupid question.|`|U2N5kQmlaa	Shes just mad just be sure to do better and good grades you get on test put it some where she will she mabye on the frige befor she wakes|`|XGy62nWJaa	Dont worry im sure she doesnt hate you. I had a hard time with my mom when i was your age. Hang in there :)
ghz5D5iLaa	They have made him this way. This should have been taken care of years ago. He cannot function on his own because he has never been taught to. She is the problem and if she will not change, he will not.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	that's not at all typical of a 9-year-old.  not that a 9-year-old is ready to be thrown to the wolves, but that's very over the top.  i have a 9 year old, and she and the other kids in her grade are very much at an age where they love being with friends ... they love parents, too, of course, but are certainly not at that level of separation anxiety.  honestly i'd say that would sound extreme even for a kindergartener.  <br>  <br>  maybe talk to the school counselor about it since its affecting school with the faked illnesses.  i'd consider talking to a counselor as a family, as well.  it's great to have a close relationship with a parent but it's not going to be helpful in the long run for him to be unable to function without mom.<br>  <br>  *eta -- it wouldn't seem terribly unlikely that it might be a result of divorce, if the divorce was recent? at any rate, some counseling for mom in how to handle it might be helpful.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	This child is indeed overly dependent on his mom. But this isn't his fault. It's his mom's fault. She's allowing this behavior to continue, she's encouraging his dependence by giving in to him when he wants her. SHE needs to put her foot down. I would guess that she gives in to him a lot because maybe she feels guilty that his parents aren't together, maybe she feels guilty that you, her husband, makes her son feel jealous.<br>  <br>  The only advice I can give you is to take a cue from your wife. If she sees absolutely no problem with this behavior, there's not much you can do. But if she ever sighs or gets irritated by him, that's your chance to jump in and speak up. "He can do that on his own, right babe?" Or, "It's probably a good time to teach him how to sleep by himself." Things of that nature.<br>  <br>  And before you do give any helpful, positive advice to your wife, be sure to praise the boy as well. Tell your wife that her son is handsome, that he's good at something, etc. If she hears you talking positively about him often, she will be much more receptive when you have something negative to say.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|NjGeH0wKaa	As soon as possible because then the child will become more independent and will turn out to be a better kid. DO NOT SPOIL HIM!!!!! that's where my  parents went wrong and now i am an ***|`|Lx8O0n0vaa	wow!thats kinda a hard one .i have a 2 yr old and my husband says i baby him too much(must be a mom thing)but at almost 10 i'd say he should be a lil more independent.and no i'm not saying toss him in the street but he should spend a lil time doing things on his own and the chores is a must.me and my son are getting ready to start working on this.if she doesnt step up i'd say he'll be w/you all for the next 40 yr or so.plus no woman will want a man thats so dependent.she might think shes loving him and making everything perfect but in the long run it will hurt him.but mothering skills is a very sensitive subject so be careful how you take this on.good luck.|`|Q4VwhcbXaa	Yikes!!  Sorry to say but this kid is not dependent on his mommy, he is jealous of you and controlling her.  I have a son who is 9 and somewhat dependent and doesn't like to be alone and such either but there are boundaries, I would never lie with him even if it meant I had to sit outside his door.  And a closed door does not get banged down.  He is controlling her and getting her to himself as much as possible.  This is unhealthy for him for her and certainly for you.  Unless she sees this though I am not sure what you can say to show her she needs to gently but firmly set boundaries.
AA11952283	I did'nt have any mood swings while on clomid,but the 2 week wait was exciting.I kept wondering did it work or not,but it did.I concieved my 1st go rd of clomid 50mg.|`|k3V2CA81aa	I never had mood swings just some "down days" with Clomid.

It's your own fault. You don't HATE someone for being shy, she may have an anxiety disorder. If I were your mom, I would've grounded you for two months, and taken away your cell phone and computer privileges. <br>  And it is fair, your mother is a good parent. I'd make your publically apologize in front of all your peers to that poor girl.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	You seem mean...im sorry :)|`|eRhJGhD5aa	first: you are a *****. im sorry but it's true. second you deserve the punishment i think. except for the panties only thing. that is a dumb punishment|`|R10oqvHyaa	Karma's a *****.<br>  Your mom sounds cool. Most mom wouldn't have the guts.|`|1elv7oc5aa	This is crazy.  Your mom is crazy.  Don't get me wrong if you were my child you would've been punished a lot longer and in different ways.  I can't believe you would behave this way at school.  But then again you probably get it from your mom, she seems a little off her rocker too.  But with the no clothes at home that's a little strange.|`|BfhGumxYaa	yes u did what u did was wrong u deserve it|`|tBtOTiQDaa	yes, and i would spank you<br>  with a belt<br>  on your bare ***<br>  you sound like areal ***** and a bully<br>  i hope karma bites your bare *** one day<br>  hard<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  oh wait, your mom already spanked you<br>  good for her<br>  yes, i would have done everything your mom did and more|`|ugqaDJSRaa	You deserve every bit of it....<br>  <br>  If I was your mum I would have made go to that poor girls house in your underwear and apologies...<br>  <br>  when you grow up and everyone thinks your a total idiot, not want to be around you, you will realise what a loser you were|`|Vv6Dg6Q0aa	If I was your mum I would have made you wear Grandma-type undies, melted a nutty chocolate bar, rubbed it on the back of the undies so it looks like you shat yourself, and made you walk to school in them.<br>  <br>  Then I would have made you apologise on your knees to the 'loser'.<br>  <br>  You're a rude, indifferent, spoiled, stuck-up, snotty little brat who needs her fair share of beatings.|`|4ahUadqxaa	What are you, a lesbian?

It's violating.<br>  <br>  so why pick on the social outcast? that is just mean!|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	haha that is a totally fair and funny punishment. <br>  You shouldn't have done that.<br>  It was rude.|`|iyvG1igSaa	youve 'hurt' other people and thought it was funny but for some reason when someone 'hurts' you, its not so funny is it. am i right?? your mom sounds pretty funny and smart but that is just a little too much if you live with your dad or brothers or something. but if its just you and your mom only or with like a sister its not as bad. theyve probably all seen you naked. dont be a pessimist- be OPTIMISTIC!! sorry- i L-O-V-E paramore!!<br>  k so i dunno. you shouldnt really hate someone you dont know though...|`|jV1Ma10jaa	hahahahaha<br>  that sounds hilarious... <br>  and no offense but i think you might have deserved it... you humiliated her in a public place and your mom is punishing you by making you do the same... only in private. <br>  and even if the girl might be annoying, you should still be nice to her. you don;t have to be her best friend but i'm sure she's just trying to fit in... you should be nice to her no matter what.|`|P48pqdAqaa	Yeah you totally deserved everything you got!!!!!<br>  I loooooove your mom!<br>  she rocks!<br>  not only is karma a ***** but so r u!|`|0pFMFkXDaa	Maybe your mother has 'feelings' for you and just wants to see you in your panties, because thats pretty harsh just for a punishment...

But because it was a girl, they ignored it.<br>  <br>  If a boy came up behind you, unhooked your bra and, pulled down your underwear, you would be screaming.  The school would take notice and, the boy would be suspended.<br>  <br>  If you don't want anyone to do it to you, you shouldn't do it to them.|`|HOdblqIkaa	well its kinda weird that your mom is still making you go around your house in your underware but at the same time you did deserve it. that girl did nothing to you and you did that to her just because she annoys you? thats not nice at all and im surprised you only got suspended for 2 weeks. if i was your mom i would make you pay me back for the time that you were suspended. your school shouldnt allow you girls to treat each other like you are and you shouldnt want to take part in any of it its immature and disrespectful. so yes you did deserve what you got.|`|6XcUZI9Yaa	You deserve every second of that, plus I would also send you to military school...|`|DauMaNUjaa	You sound like a straight up b*tchy asshole.

Yes you deserved everything you got you are nothing but an annoying little *****. I feel sorry for your mother for having such a loser like you. You are extremely immature and she should have taken you out of dance.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Yes.  You treated someone who was already feeling very low like a piece of dirt, and now you deserve to see how it feels.  I hope you grow up and become a more compassionate and nicer person when you get older, because they are enough self-centered mean losers in the adult world already.  Suck it up and maybe think about how you made that poor girl feel.|`|oem5yEUDaa	I bet you've probably never spoken to that poor girl, you just say you hate her and she's annoying because she isn't in any of your stupid little groups. Your mum should take you out in public and pull your pants down and see how you like it. No wonder depression is on the rise with idiots like you around.|`|5i1J2RLLaa	Did you deserve any of that?<br>  <br>  Of course! Why couldn't you leave that poor girl alone, so what she doesn't want to be in a clique, big deal!  And why are you pant-sing  people in dance class anyway, you are supposed to be dancing not making some girl's life miserable. Oh if I was your mother it would be much worse, much much worse punishment.|`|txG1hqV4aa	You deserved it.<br>  You hate a girl that you don't even know, and pantsed her.<br>  You're a b!tchh.<br>  <br>  Your mom sounds pretty cool though. She has good punishments.|`|AA10411777	OKay you might get older and forget this all together but that girl will remeber that moment for the rest of her life. how would you feel  if someone pants you and your underwear came off and maybe the guy you like saw you and laughed. Honestly you should go an appologize to this girl even if you never talk to her again. If you do this and tell your mom what you did she would probably let you have your underwear back|`|BOKyHQUhaa	Yes, you deserved this.<br>  You completely humiliated a girl who had done nothing at all to anybody, including you, and she probably feels like she can never show her face at that dance school or to anybody who attends that school ever again.<br>  Aren't you ashamed of yourself at ALL?<br>  I commend your mother on her parenting, but I would have done that and many other things if I was your mother. <br>  For example, I 'd hand you over to my father. He was an MP in the Vietnam War. He is VERY big on discipline. He'd make you wish that you'd never set eyes on that dance school, what with the yelling, and punishments, and being sent to  the wood shed (don't know what that is? ask a grandparent- they'll supply you with information). <br>  I hope you never try to do something like that again. It makes you look uneducated, rude, unkind, and it makes your mother look like a terrible parent. I hope she makes you go outside in your undies with the words I HATE PEOPLE WHO DID NOTHING TO ME painted all over you in bright blue paint. You should be forced to have your fair share of embarrassment x10 for what you did.<br>  <br>  Honestly, I hope that people don't grow up to be the way you acted. The world would be in chaos.|`|9LTWa08Laa	wtf is wrong with you ?<br>  do you think its "cool" and "funny" to pants other girls<br>  grow up and stop being such an immature little preteen<br>  yeah you do deserve that punishment, your mom is smart.<br>  <br>  & yeah trust me, karma's a bxtch.|`|PeoOb4aHaa	Ketchup Ed, is that you?<br>  <br>  Just so no one can tattle on me for not answering the question: you totally deserve it, you little bully.|`|I64JOuMKaa	LOL DAMN I LOVE YOUR MOM .<br>  <br>  dude come on , you friggen pants her and everyone saw her vaaagina .<br>  come one you would be so embarassed if it was you, I would probably smack the shiet outta you if you did it but I probably wouldnt cry just be super embarrased.<br>  <br>  I mean comeon , she has to pay for expensive dance lessons that you aren't even going too atm cause your suspended.<br>  <br>  seems like that punishment is only minimal and hilarious ! LOL .<br>  goodluck !<br>  im wearing my hoody and winterjacket cause im cold .<br>  <br>  jealous ? LOL|`|PbykKE2oaa	HAHAHAHAHAHA ROFL<br>  <br>  I love your mom. she sounds awesome. <br>  karma's a bitchh, you deserve it|`|c4d63478f0175c245353b6222ab7a81eaa	I hope it's only you and your mom at home and no boys or men.|`|GGH0HVdvaa	You've asked this question before. Are you trying to look like the biggest and stupidest b*tch ever? You're nearly there!!|`|l1STgPyRaa	i like what your mom did but then i would have also made you do something for the girl that you did it to as well and maybe at lest tried to make it public to all your friends and school about her punishment to you and i would be grounding you until you had paid back the wasted money that she had to pay and then think about it again as to if i was going to let you keep grounding or let you just go 2 more weeks. you would not have the net you would not have a phone you would not have anything you would do home work you would do anything the other girl said to do and that is what your life would be for at lest 2 months <br>  hope this puts it into some prospective for you|`|jkDbDjcRaa	Not funny.<br>  These types of questions are so overdone.<br>  Grow up.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	i dont spank my kids but u deserved <br>  it buy the way here is a lesson for u pantsed would be to put the pants on someone <br>  depants would be to take them off
5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	well for my cousins wedding the lady had them close there eyes and used hair spray . not up close or anything . kind of a mist and there make up lasted all day .|`|zlGb9NkZaa	powdering before & sometimes after applying your makeup helps (after for blush & eyeshadow)<br>  <br>  but really, a lot of it is the brand. <br>  i like Physician's Formula or Nicole Miller.|`|xzMkUCizaa	I use clinique and it does not stay on too well and I tried cover girl and to my surprise it stay's on even after i run around all day @ work and then come home to run around after my 2 yr old.<br>  <br>  The hairspray thing be careful I remember I tried it along time ago and it was sprayed all over my eyes and my eyelashes where stiff all day lol|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I usually only apply my makeup once a day, unless i am going somewhere special.  I use cheepo makeup.  Cover Girl powder, .99 eyeliner and mascara and blush, what ever is cheepest.  I do splurge on the lipstick..I buy color stay lipstick, you can usually get it on sale for buy one get one for half price.  It stays on forever and is hard to take off.  I find if your lips have color you look good all day long.|`|KmC0K59taa	For me, it's just about finding the right brand.  I use Revlon Colorstay eyeliners.  Most pencils fade.  Use a lot of loose powder on foundation and blush.  Look for shadows that say long wearing or 12 hrs.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	A friend who did modelling taught me the trick of completely colouring in your lips with lipliner before applying the lipstick.  Your lipstick will stay on all day - even if it's a cheapie brand!|`|vCWVimTzaa	bare minerals is lightweight and stays on all day. It also takes like 5 minutes to apply, including eyes, which is great because with a 16 month old tornado and a 2 week old newborn I dont have much time for morning beauty stuff. A lot of days I skip makeup altogether, but if I know I need to run errands or just need a boost after feeling like a human burp rag, I like to fix my hair and put on makeup..even if no one sees it but me. Bare minerals is a bit pricey, but it lasts a really long time and is worth it.|`|77hZZZXvaa	Sounds like you got some good answers except for spraying hairspray on your face, gross! Don't do that. They make spritzers that you can use to set your makeup, especially made for skin. I use one by dermologica, I think it was kind of pricey (maybe $30), but its seriously lasted forever! Good stuff.|`|ied3Ww49aa	I found MAC and Bare Minerals to work the best for me. Also..after applying, lightly spray hair spray over make up. ( spray and walk though it) it helps to keep your make up in place. Got the tip from Glamour magazine and it works amazingly well.|`|TVqXrOq2aa	I put a very small dab of foundation on my eyelids and blend and then use powder. I was told this will keep your eyeshadow from getting that crease or looking "greasy" at the end of the day. Works for me and I use revlon eyeshadow.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Almay for base(BEST STUFF EVER) wont rub off.
46tTmMT7aa	With Ava, who is almost 20 months, I put her on the dining room chair that has a padded seat, so it makes it a little safer and not slippery. I put her with the rinsing side and she "rinses" the dishes for me. Of course she makes a mess, but it is easy to clean up water. I usually don't rinse with hot water, normally just luke warm water that is not going to burn Ava.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	As you said it isnt very safe for him to "help" you, but very cute.  you could try and let him do something else to "help" you while you wash the dishes.  He could mop the floor.  Give him a squirt bottle withwater and let him spray the floor and mop.  My kids love to mop!  Give him a wet sponge, just his so it doesnt have germs and ask him to clean the fridge, dishwasher, and cabintets, he can use the spray bottle for them also.  Here the spray bottle is a big hit, just not to much water(thats what i am always saying...lol)  Get him a duster to dust.|`|AZRj3vaLaa	use it as fun in the bath tub, put some swim shorts on him and run a little warm water and put some plastic cups or by a plastic tea party set and ask him to wash his dishes in there .and give him a little sponge...just an idea<br>  <br>  its good he likes to do dishes..hell be a good man for some lucky girl..lol|`|uAyYRXnvaa	I put the chair next to me on the washing side and call out the items I want put in the water next.... e.g. Plate...... spoon....  3 forks....  1 plate, 1 spoon and a mug.  It's like a game because they have to quickly find what I'm asking for and plonk it in.  <br>  <br>  I ran a food stall, so before my kids could talk I taught them how to properly use a sharp knife, what hot water is, what things are sharp, what happens when glass breaks, etc.  They learn very quickly and easily.  Don't worry so much about the dirty dishes.  They won't make him sick unless there's been raw chicken juice sitting in them for more than 4 hours and he slurps it up!  If you're worried about the chair getting slippery, then just put a teatowel or a handtowel on it so even if it's wet, it won't be slippery.  <br>  <br>  You also don't need to rinse with hot water.  Bacteria can't actually grow on ceramic or metal surfaces.  Only something that's porous - like plastic cutting boards, unglazed terracotta bowls etc.|`|17c9652c588d0895008ca5507d3558f9aa	My son is almost 2 and I don't really let him help with the dishes. But maybe you can have a place where his dishes go ( sippys, plates). You could have to have a place that he can easily reach. And let him dry them and put them away. I can see where he would want to help, my son loves anything to do with water. But I don't think I could handle the mess he would create. See if he enjoys putting them away and wait a little longer to let him get in the water.|`|40f1bd1d39cb27755e8236db9352fd5caa	Buy some plastic toy dishes.  Fill a big bowl up with water.  Bring a small table into the kitchen, and set him up to wash his dishes while you wash yours.  Allow him to help clean up the mess afterward, since water will surely be everywhere.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Toddler's probably can't handle the wash and dry it out process at this age. It would be more of a mess. I would be less concerned of illness and more afraid of them cutting themselves if a knife were in the sink where it wasn't seen easily by a toddler.  Unless you're plates have mold growing on them before you wash them you're not going to get sick cleaning up food from plates you just ate off of. <br>  <br>  My son is almost 2 and loves to help in the kitchen. I let him help with things in the dishwasher. I take out all the knives or things he could get hurt on first and put those away myself. He loves to take out the forks and spoons and put them into the drawer for me.  He loves handing me his plates and things to put away.  When I load the dirty dishes in I put the soap in at the end and he will come help me push the racks into the washer and close the door. I let him push the button on the washer to start it. I have a little  happy face sticker on the button so he knows just what one he has to push when I tell him it's OK.<br>  <br>  He also loves to help put scoops of food into the bowl for our cats and gives our dogs their dog treat each day.  He also loves to help pick up his toys with some help and to help make his bed or hand me hangers for the laundry and turn the dryer on for me when I put the damp stuff inside. <br>  <br>  I say anyway you can get them to learn to help now in small steps will make it easier later when they are big enough to take over some of these jobs by themselves in the future.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	I give my daughter the clean spoons and fork and give her the tap water sprayer and let her "rinse" while i quickly do the others...I let her wash her unbreakable plate and glass too. when I say I'm done honey... she'll chime in with her "I'm done too mum!"  then we are both happy... I've learned that it's best to teach them chores while they are interested as long as they are supervised and away from potential dangers rather than shooing them away to just play with their toys... coz at this stage, chore IS PLAY AND FUN ;D same way with watering the plants and loading the wash and folding the laundry and sweeping the floor! (i even bought her a small sized broom at toys r us lol)  buy your boy an apron or put a towel around him for the inevitable water splash.  you would be amazed how frenzy helpful they are and such gracious cheerful little helpers.  take advantage of it coz I am lol
irLnPW4aaa	I've never had to show proof of immunization for any of those sort of activities.  Usually only daycare and school requires immunization records.|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	My children are involved in Scouts, baseball, basketball and a variety of other activities and we have never had to show their immunization records.  We simply sign a form indicating we have insurance and waive them of any responsibility for injuries that we are aware could occur.|`|j2mRop0laa	I've never had to show immunization records and my kids have been to a lot of different places for activities.<br>  But yes, we do sign a waver and fill out an insurance information card.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	No, I've never ever heard of that request, my son attends a gymnastics club.
epLfYG7Kaa	WOW, those are awesome names!<br>  <br>  - Estelle Marie - LOVE the name estelle, it's so feminine. Marie goes great with it. Essy is a really cute nickname too!<br>  - Calista Giselle - I don't really care for Calista. But, Giselle is a georgous name! Maybe you could do Caylyn, Caitlin, Cady, Candace, Cara, (Cara sounds great with Giselle!) Caralynn, or even Evelyn. I think those sound good with Giselle.<br>  - Ashton - That name is awesome too! I love it for a boy or a girl.<br>  <br>  Overall, good job! :-)<br>  <br>  And yes, they sound like siblings. Essy, Callie and Ashton go well together.|`|7604a798f65911a1d922d91e12d53bc8aa	I like Ashton and Calista. They sound good but too much alike is not a good thing (I know someone who named his son Bernie and his daughter Berneice, LOL).|`|R5Amm3Qzaa	i think ashton is really random<br>  but the other two are nice and they sound like sisters.|`|okpAjss6aa	ashton and eatelle|`|H0bkxcjJaa	Yeah they sound fine|`|OiFNZnwOaa	glad you left one spot for your husbands opinion lol|`|Uo0b2aShaa	yes
gHR4vlcDaa	I think it feels best to always have a spare room for guests or storage or computer..... But yes we are considering, We have 3bd bath only about 1000 sq ft.... With one kid it was fine but he was never a baby in this house, Madi is now here and those people take up the most space out of anyone in the house,,. We are cram packed like sardines. They take up sooooo much space with all their necessities. But it depends on the room you have currently...and the money. It is a buyers market hardcore and really great prices in our area, so if you are debating only have a lil space have access or can aford new housing I would say go for it......  think about all the stuff, crib, playpen, bouncer, walker, high chair, toys, car seat, play matt, baby food, bottles, (kitchen cupboard space) baby bath and bathing supplies, toy box, lol lots of stuff and thats just sitting here looking around my house- and my daughter is 7months old|`|NPmRmnG6aa	We have a 3 bedroom home. We have to have a home office since we own a business, and I want to keep the guest room since we use it a lot. We are finishing our basement so we can move the office down the basement. I feel that our 3 bedroom 1500 sq ft home is too small, but we can not afford to sell our home and buy a new one. Hopefully it will be big enough so we can stay here for a few more years.|`|AA11764194	No.. watching the money we are spending..|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Now is not the time to be a seller, but it's definitely a great time to be a buyer, new baby or not!  We bought our home 2 1/2 years before our baby was born.  Good luck to ya and congrats on the new addition!|`|8juUgSK2aa	dh= divorced husband?|`|HPRlEWu1aa	yea my hubby and i are looking as well, but were looking at buying a condo. were looking into bying a 3br 1.5 bth|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	we are looking to upgrade too.  She is due in june and  we had planned to try to have the  house ready and on the market by mid march but  looks like april would  be  more likely  and She will be 7 months preggy by then and  were not sure we want to deal with selling the house, finding a new one and moving  with all the craziness  the  third trimester brings.  <br>  <br>  so now we are looking to wait till  spring 2010.   its easier to sell a house in spring before the new school year starts|`|8e9T5H5jaa	We are purchasing a new home because we do not want to waste money on renting anymore, but I totally see where you are coming from! We currently live in a 2 bedroom/1 bath, and I can't imagine us having a child and living here! We barely have enough room for our stuff! - Another reason why we are so looking forward to buying a home, more space!|`|mgiJVjaKaa	If you have the money, now can be a good time to buy in some areas.<br>  <br>  My husband and I were looking at buying a house last summer but decided to get all of our finances completely straight (meaning no debt) before we go down that road. It's worked out well as he's now switching careers and going to school. <br>  <br>  We are moving to a new apartment with 2 bedrooms, but I think that will be plenty of room for us + baby.|`|dip4oxB5aa	rent young girl.  <br>  If you dont want to rent are you ready for increased insurance payments, increased property taxes.  Have you planned for yard upkeep, mowing and planting.Have you planned for upkeep on the home? Have you an exterminator? Do you have a roof leak guy?  Do you have a water heater guy? What about when the plumbing backup? Are your ready? firm up and get strong, life is in your face now.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I am also preggo and we are having to having our little one. We live in a 2 bedroom also. We have not even talked about getting a new place not till the next baby. lol|`|u93oneUXaa	It's a baby - it's not like it will take up 3 rooms - stay in your current home.|`|qySznFXaaa	whats wrong with an apartment|`|2TaAScEiaa	nope|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	A two bedroom should be just enough room for the both of you unless you sleep in one room and the husband in the other room. :) Then you might need to contimplate getting a room for the child. But if your husband is not very involved, you'll need to remember that you might have to be the one with stitches in your bottom up late feeding the baby. Rooming together for a little bit might be a good idea.
A1IisrUraa	nobody knows that till the baby is born??|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	most likely it will be light brown when its born and change quickly to a dark brown. eyes will most likley be blue. my sons father has blue eyes and so did my son. either way im sure it will be soo cute. good luck!
8PkEkTcZaa	50% 50% percent chances just use protection and you will have nothing to worry about
vZ0Ml4FVaa	get to a doctor|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	I'm 31 weeks and have the same problem all to often, I asked my midwife about this today at my appointment and how she explained " with 2 pregnancies your bodies more attuned to the different aches and pains because you've been there already, your round ligaments are being pulled and or stretched when the baby moves, I had a c-section with my first and I get really sharp stabbing pains in my back, side, lower abd, and pelvic area and it gets to the point where I can't move at all and if my husband even touches me i wanna cry, I explained this all to her and she said it was natural and not to worry unless you are having at least 6 contraction an in hr and there is blood or watery discharge. However if you feel like something is wrong or just want assurance without having to go to the er, you can call the er and ask to speak with the consulting nurse and they'll put you through right away that way they can assess over the phone whether you need to come in or not|`|sRy2SKpXaa	It sounds like contractions, but if you're saying it doesn't feel like contractions, i'm not sure. I took a trip to L & D a few weeks ago for horrible cramps in my belly and was told it was just round ligament pain and it was normal. I couldn't walk or anything without bawling my eyes out. If your doctor doesn't call back soon i'd go to the Labor and Delivery unit right away, just to be on the safe side. Even if it's nothing, it's much much better to know than not to. Good luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  And it's way too soon for you too be in labor hon!|`|SUT3yL0oaa	I'd go to labor and delivery IMMEDIATELY! My doc just warned me about this kind of thing at my last appt. If your that uncomfortable, definately don't wait on a call back just go!|`|uzoh5XvWaa	GO TO THE HOSPITAL SOMETHING COULD BE SERIOUSLY WRONG!!!|`|AA11606978	I would call the ambulance just to be sure! Good luck!|`|tcHkn0VIaa	GO TO THE ER|`|AA11542929	go to the er..|`|GdiyfNCgaa	uhm, well its never happened to me, but sounds like your starting labor.<br>  <br>  i would definitely call the er, and ask their opinion.|`|gcs54mvUaa	go your local emergency room immediately. I work in an er and this could be really serious. Let us know how it all works out.|`|ZXeUJ4RRaa	go 2 the hospital now|`|wunlQTOLaa	i think that you should tell your husband too call a doctor|`|CxCigxZIaa	GO TO THE HOSPITAL NOWWWWWWWWWWW!<br>  It might not be anything...but better safe than sorry.|`|H5NGXgqsaa	It sounds as if you 'may' be having 'braxton hix' contractions...certainly you know it isn't menstrual because you are so far along in your pregnancy...However, at such a stage you may indeed be feeling variable stages of discomfort...for such times you need to begin preparing to handle the birth process/contractions etc which certainly lie ahead... you may find it helpful to begin practicing the relaxation techniques...etc... Are you planning to have this child in a certain way?? If so, such preparations are due now to practice upon....believe it or not, whatever birth technique you may choose...self control/self discipline & relaxing/breathing techniques will offer you utmost relief & control that will assist you through the greatest of challenges that the birth process has in store for you as well as many others. Being this is your second child, I trust you already know what may lie ahead...however, you may also be allowing yourself to become to apprehensive in anticipation of the birthing you know you are or may be about to face~.. I encourage you to find peace & resolve...along with practicing the breathing etc techniques which we are most all fairly aware of...this will help you in a BIG way... try relaxing in a spa/bath environment when you find yourself feeling discomfort...try your best not to fret & fear the unknown...having such self-control will not only benefit you now, but also in the long run as well...<br>  You should feel comfortable in contacting your OB/GYN whenever you feel a sincere concern...as well as take the advice he or his assistants may offer you...The baby is not yet due to enter our world; however, we all know they choose the time when they wish to come forth...often times to our complete surprise! RELAX gal...soon your lil one will be a beautiful reality~ Take care~|`|619a2003fc4308b68dc4b581fb6eaa7caa	I'm 37 weeks having the same problems just have ur hubby give a massage..it the baby give a lot pelvic preessure|`|AA10529334	Go to the hospital.|`|NiOjHyfKaa	GO TO THE ER ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|vj3WSxzWaa	go to the ER soon!
PuRpsENEaa	So cute! I have a friend with that name but she goes by Tori. :) <br>  <br>  Joel Michael would be a great male name with it.|`|llgBLR6daa	it sounds like an old-fashioned name (in a good way). It's pretty i like it. another old-fashioned name would sound cute with her. maybe james, felix, or something like that if its a boy. for a girl i think something like Emily or Elizabeth. congrats!|`|iUzSlmSbaa	It's a nice name ... Very elegant and timeless... but would not go well with a modern name for a boy.. if you like old names..<br>  <br>  <br>  James Evan<br>  <br>  Edward Thomas<br>  <br>  Samuel Nolan<br>  <br>  Patrick Wayne<br>  <br>  Dominick Alexander<br>  <br>  Andrew Liam<br>  <br>  Robert William|`|4bzZNCYBaa	I love it!

XOtOMncwaa	I love it, were also big fans of southern names, my sons name is Lane Mason, so I was a big fan of Mason too, and my sons first name was after Lane Frost, the bull rider, I wasn't crazy on it but my fiance insisted.<br>  But Ryder is absolutely adorable, I'm not crazy about spelling it with an "h" but I really like it.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Rhyder...<br>  <br>  The other spelling in my part of the country looks like Ryder rent-a-trucks.  Besides, Rhyder is different.<br>  <br>  However, in the final analysis, either one is good.  :)|`|AA11920812	I like it!<br>  <br>  RYDER is a great boys name, imo. I think that kids will tease about anything. If not a name than something else...they never have a problem finding something.|`|2a726b94b1136e6caf4d74c8981c9e24aa	Looks like a nice, strong name.|`|wWcxe0Gpaa	i think maybe you could use it as a middle name but i would use it as a middle name but it kinda cool|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I love that name...if i do recall a celebrity just named her son that i cant remember which one...but i like it spelt ryder!!|`|bd6049bde2b5a358ef763f75b8047b11aa	I personally think it's ways too commerical... not original enough... he'll be the 10th ryder in his class. and  if you do choose that name please leave the H out of it!|`|06iOhuHWaa	isnt that what Kate Hudson named her son?<br>   i like it. just dont spell it with an H|`|r4E2zXL8aa	i like ryder. it's neat.|`|mFEevGRXaa	i like it with the H!  you don't see that very often|`|AA10043878	Pick any name that you like but do your child a favor that will last them thier entire life; spell it sensibly because if you don't; then the kid will be hasseling with teaches, drill sergeants, employers, the IRS, Social Security Administration, etc, for the rest of his life. At least you haven't taken it to the extreme like happens in the city; such as:<br>  <br>  Tanyetta Monique Shaw-noc-wah Jones or Daquuan Rasta Jackson or Chareese Tequila Perotte, etc.<br>  <br>  You kid will want others to take him serious in life, in school and in work. Look at Frank Zappa! He named his gaughter Moon Pie or Moon Beam or some crap like that. What kind of name is that?|`|wJDfFutBaa	I really like it. We are expecting our first baby in May and the name has been as difficult as the pregnancy, lol. I was in love with the name Ayden, my honey, not so much. Then we tried a few different things. We said the name the way a teacher would in roll call -- Last name, First name. We said it the way a sports announcer would introduce him if he were an athlete. I acted like I was a school girl and had a crush on a boy with his name, and then we used it like a pastor would at his wedding. We also imagined someone with his name in many different careers. Sounds a little crazy but it drives me bonkers when people name their sons "little boy names". You have to remember that this is his name forever. <br>  <br>  We decided on the name Madden. It's totally outside of the box, but when we heard the name we both looked at each other and said THATS IT! If you both like the name (and I think it fits well as a baby and throughout life) then go with it.|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's not my favorite by any means but I don't hate it either.<br>  <br>  I'd stick with Ryder, though, the H in it doesn't look very well.|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	I really like the name Ryder!  But leave the "h" out, it looks funny.
14JQ11AUaa	OMG!!! I came across this question and noticed you had your baby :) I told you it would happen soon...2 days after I answered your question he was born yay!! Congratulations picture please :) I recommend that you get in touch with the lactationist  at the hospital you delivered at! They will help SO much. I saw maybe 3 or 4 different ones in the first 8 weeks lol. I wanted things to go well. But I ended up not producing enough milk, I was pumping for the first 2 weeks then stopped. It slowed my milk down and my son wasn't getting what he wanted so I did both formula and nursed. By 4 months, he DID NOT want anything to do with my breast :( I am ok with it now, I made it that far..so that is a plus! It depends on the baby really. Some babies get REAL confused with the nipple changes while others do not. My son did not get confused...he just ended up liking his bottle A LOT more lol. Good luck and congrats again!!! I will stop by again..pictures... :) Gosh I LOVE babies!!!!|`|Bg6txvxqaa	If you want your baby to have breast milk rather than formula, which I think most mums do, and you're having problems because of the transition from bottle to nipple, you may have to express milk instead and continue to bottle feed him. At least that way, he'll still be getting breast milk, just unfortunately you won't be able to breast feed.<br>  <br>  If you continue to stay away from the bottle, you may be able to transition back to nipple, but it's very hard to do apparently.<br>  <br>  These are my firsts so I'm afraid I have no previous experience when it comes to breast feeding however, I'm completely torn between breastfeeding and pumping now (though I had my heart set on pumping before) so I have researched it throroughly to see if I will be able to do either once I get home if I decide to pump after their births.|`|avx7bLnKaa	just keep putting him to the breast, don't wait for him to cry, stop bottles totally if your milk is in.... the more he sucks at the breast the more milk you'll make<br>  <br>  also newborns nurse constantly that doesn't mean you don't make enouh, that is just nature<br>  <br>  moreover some babies like my firstborn nursed every hour it seemed<br>  while other babies like my second born urse every 2-3 hours and are happy and content<br>  <br>  it just depends on the baby's personality <br>  <br>  don't start doubting yourelf yet<br>  you are doing good|`|zlGb9NkZaa	YES!<br>  and you can also sabotage your milk production by supplementing with formula, because your milk is on supply & demand--the more you breastfeed (demand) the more milk you produce & vice versa.<br>  <br>  check out www.kellymom.com|`|3JyiTBz4aa	No, that was not long enough for the baby to develop a preference over nipples.  <br>  <br>  Keep breastfeeding - it gets easier each day.  Three days is still pretty early, so hang in there.  One morning you'll wake up and be like "Oh my god - where did these implants come from!!!", and you'll have tons and tons of milk.<br>  <br>  Milk is produced on supply and demand.  If you supplement, then you will never produce enough milk.<br>  <br>  One of the most useful websites with good information about breastfeeding is this:   <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/index.html</a><br>  <br>  There is a whole section there on concerns about supply.  Read that and get informed.<br>  <br>  If you need any other advice, just let me know.  I felt like I had so many troubles, and then nursed successfully for a LONG time.  ;)<br>  <br>  It really does get easier, and it is so worth it!!|`|DhmUgq0maa	Just offer him the breast whenever he cries...no bottles at all, he will get used to it very quickly...The longer you supplement the more problems it could cause, I couldn't make enough milk for my sons every feed so supplemented with formula and at 4 months old he refused the breast an had to be put onto the bottle.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	My daughter never had an issue. She was bottle fed for the first 3 days of her life while in the hospital, and was still able to nurse just fine. She's almost 11 months now, and I work full time so she gets bottles of breast milk and formula 5 days a week, and has never had "nipple confusion," thankfully. <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd just keep on nursing. Talk to a lactation consultant if you need to, most pediatrician offices have one on staff. If you don't continue to at least try at this point, your milk may never come in. Good luck with whatever you decide!|`|tQVBDx5Paa	How are you supplementing?  Breastfeeding and then bottle or giving a bottle a certain number of times per day.  He is just 3 days old so I would just put him to the breast.  He may need to eat every hour, but it won't last to long before your supply catches up.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	If you want to be a breastfeeding mom you have to breastfeed.  Drop the supplementation.  Your milk won't come in as effectively and your baby can't regulate your supply if you are supplementing.  Be patient with him, offer the breast often.  Babies have to work harder when they breastfeed.  The bottle is very easy to get milk out of.  He'll get it.  Try different positions, work with the lactation consultant at the hospital, contact your local La Leche league, get support from friends who've breastfed.  Two days of supplement won't have him turned off of the breast forever!|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	i always supplmented and brestfed sucessfully 4 four months which is what we wanted <br>  <br>  nipple confusion is a myth nd just in peoples heads

dRKGXQmeaa	My little guy is six weeks, and we've been using a pacifier since about the second week (thumbs down me if you want.)<br>  After a week home from the hospital and still literally no more than an hour of sleep and round the clock cluster feeding (I'm talking nursing ALL night, not just waking up but not even getting a wink in, I was spending half of every day crying from exhaustion) I couldn't take it anymore and gave him a pacifier. He was doing some comfort sucking and this got me a little break here and there, while I pumped more during the day to keep my milk supply growing for him. At 5 weeks when he did go through a growth spurt, he actually wouldn't take the pacifier anymore at all. Now we can give it to him again since he's gotten the milk supply up and is satisfied with what he gets at meals. They seem to know right away once it goes in their mouth whether milk will come out of it or not... and they let you know if they're not ok with that. Ever noticed if your baby will cry after a few seconds sucking on your finger if she's really hungry? Same with a pacifier. If they're hungry they'll spit it out and demand a boob.<br>  Despite how my guy was, I still recommend you don't give a pacifier unless you really have to for your own sanity. <br>  Generally it works really well for just leaving him with a visiting friend or grandparent for ten minutes while I take a shower these days, or just helping him comfort himself to sleep (I always take it away once he's asleep though) but I don't use it for the comfort sucking anymore. I figure if he's just comfort sucking without being hungry and does it at the boob, that's great because he can still gain weight and get nutrition from it without even meaning to.|`|z6IekuwSaa	She will not accept the pacifier if she is hungry! Trust me! lol, my girl screams if I try to give it to her when she wants milk. lol. And it actually helps them increase their sucking. So they learn to suck better. Which might make nursing sessions shorter. But if you want your milk supply increased then let her comfort suck at your breast. If your milk supply is fine a pacifier should be fine to use. Also pacifiers have been shown to lower the risk of SIDS|`|0b822c825c81fdba58631516562146c2aa	My docs opinion was if they are hungry they will refuse the paci.  He also said it is best once breastfeeding is established.  We use a paci to comfort and soothe my son when he is sleepy, but just not letting himself go to sleep, or just fussy for no apparent reason. I don't use it to shut him up or overuse it.  At most he uses it 2-3 times a day for a few minutes. They have been a godsend for us!  He really likes the Soothie ones, the big green ones.  Good luck and congrats on your little one!|`|J9Tbun7naa	I was worried about the same thing with my daughter....I soon learnt two things that stopped me worrying about it <br>  1) If your baby is really hungry, they will not be happy with a paci<br>  2)...better still, only offer your baby the paci once they've had a big feed and your are confident they are only comfort sucking. When they wake up, offer a feed first before the paci|`|aLAmvX5Naa	Even newborns know the difference between a pacifier and the boob. Your daughter won't miss a meal because of the pacifier. Plus, pacifiers reduce the chance of SIDS :)|`|Fd4lITkvaa	After 5wks of breastfeeding she will spit it out if she is hungry. She will realize that nothings coming out and get upset. I started using one around that age, only when we were away from home and he was fussy though. It came in handy at the store or in the car when it was hard to comfort him.|`|wURg3jBcaa	I have no problems with a pacifier- it's been great for when she just wants to suck.  Believe me, if that thing isn't spurting out milk, she won't be giving up your boob anytime soon!|`|7kosr9mcaa	Soothers are great! I'm sure she will let you know if she is hungry.

I breastfed but also introduced pacifiers after the first three months.  Some mothers do it earlier and some later.  I had read some studies recently that suggested that using a pacifier reduces the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.  Consequently, since there are more articles saying that pacifiers are not harmful and if there is even the slightest chance that these studies are correct, it's worth trying a small nipple pacifier.  <br>  <br>  Pacifiers come in different sizes and shapes.  Make sure you get one suited to your baby's age.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	if shes just wanting to suck the soother will satisfy her. if shes hungry she will spit it out and cry for you. she wont suck on it and let herself starve. babies are so teeny and precious and defenseless but they do have survival instincts built in too. they trully are amazing.<br>  <br>  i was so scared that my son would get hooked on a soother if i let him have it so i was very skeptacle. i started reading about it and found out that newborns that use a soother are less likley to die from SIDS. I cant remember exactly but it was something about working the muscles in the throat more. anyways, when i finally let him have it he loved it for awhile. i think it was about 4 months he was addicted to it and then he just didnt want it anymore. we just moved and there was one in a bag of toys that had been packed away for awhile. he found it when we were unpacking his room and stuck it in his mouth, played with it for a few minutes and has since completley forgotten about it. <br>  <br>  good luck and congrats on the little one!|`|NroZQN5vaa	We used a pacifier on our daughter. It worked pretty well. She always spit it out when she wanted to eat. A word of advice, though, start taking it away when she is 6 months old. Start with not giving it to her during the day and then not at nap time and then not at all. That's the best time and it'll be a lot easier to get her to not use it any more than when she's 2 or 3 like some people do.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	We used a pacifier with our baby.

I'd personally suggest that most breastfed babies - if they get a pacifier at all - would be better off without a pacifier until mom's milk supply is well established (6-8 weeks, usually) and the 6 week growth spurt is over. That way you've established a good milk supply and don't lose any much-needed breast stimulation to a pacifier.<br>   What should I consider before using a pacifier?<br>  <br>  After the early weeks, pacifier use is less likely to cause problems as long as you are aware of the following:<br>  <br>      * Never substitute a pacifier for a feeding at the breast or try to hold the baby off longer between feedings with one. (See Should baby be on a schedule?)<br>      * There are studies that indicate that babies who take a pacifier tend to wean earlier than those who do not. This is most likely because as a baby gets older - once he's established on solid food - it is often his desire to suck that ensures he continues to seek out the breast often. Babies who use pacifiers are getting that need to suck met with something other than the breast, and therefore may decide to give up breastfeeding sooner than if they did not take a pacifier.<br>      * Some babies who take pacifiers are more prone to oral yeast (thrush) which can be transferred to mom's nipples.<br>      * A number of studies have shown a link between pacifier use and an increased incidence of ear infections.<br>      * Pacifiers can result in choking or strangulation if the pacifier breaks or if it is tied around the neck (which it never should be). Follow all safety guidelines and keep an eye out for the many pacifier safety recalls. Also, keep in mind that latex allergy is becoming an increasing problem - consider using a silicone pacifier rather than latex.<br>      * Prolonged pacifier use can result in teeth misalignment, and can also occasionally lead to shaping of the soft palate or speech problems.<br>      * Giving baby a pacifier will increase mom's chances of ovulating and getting pregnant. Exclusive breastfeeding, depending upon your breastfeeding frequency and other factors, is a method of birth control that can be more than 98% effective during the first 6 months and 94% effective during the second six months. Ensuring that all of baby's sucking needs are met at the breast increases the effectiveness of this method of contraception.<br>  <br>   When to avoid the pacifier<br>  <br>  If you observe any of the following problems, it would be a good idea to discontinue pacifier use, at least until the problem is resolved:<br>  <br>      * Pacifier use reduces your baby's frequency or duration of feeds (newborns should be nursing at least 8 to 12 times a day).<br>      * Baby is having difficulties nursing well (this may be due to nipple confusion).<br>      * Baby is having problems with weight gain (in which case baby needs to nurse as often as possible).<br>      * Mom is having problems with sore nipples (baby may be causing this due to nipple confusion)<br>      * Mom is having milk supply problems (in which case she needs to put baby to breast, not pacifier, at every opportunity in order to increase milk supply).<br>      * Mom and/or baby have thrush, particularly if it's hard to get rid of or repeated.<br>      * Baby is having repeated ear infections (an increased incidence of ear infections has been linked to pacifier use).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t104600.asp#T104601" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/t10460...</a><br>  4 TIMES TO PULL THE PLUG<br>  <br>  Babies have an intense need to suck, and some have more intense needs than others. Babies even suck their thumbs in the womb. Next to holding and feeding, sucking is the most time-tested comforter.<br>  <br>  1. In the newborn nursery. Peer through any newborn nursery window and you're sure to witness contented babies lying quietly in plastic boxes all plugged in with no place to go. Pull the plug on this scene. These babies should be plugged into their mothers.<br>  <br>  2. In the early weeks of breastfeeding. When learning how to breastfeed, a baby should have only mother's nipple in his mouth. About the only thing a newborn has to "learn" is how to suck on mother's nipple the right way to get the most milk.<br>  <br>      * A baby sucks on a pacifier differently than on mother's nipples. Some newborns, develop nipple confusion when given a pacifier or bottle nipple when they are learning to suck from mother. Pacifiers have a narrow base, so baby doesn't have to open his lips wide. This often results in poor latch-on techniques, sore nipples, and a difficult start at breastfeeding.<br>      * Many sensitive babies gag on every pacifier you might try. The texture, taste, and smell are rejected hands down. Other babies make the transition from rubber to flesh nipples without any confusion or complaint.<br>      * Our advice: Avoid pacifiers until your newborn learns to latch on properly and you have a good mi<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/articledetail.cfm?id=94" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidsgrowth.com/resources/arti...</a><br>  Another reason parents use a pacifier is the hope it will prevent their infant from sucking their thumb. Many adults believe that thumb sucking is a disgusting habit and that children who suck their thumbs instead of a pacifier will develop teeth deformities. Not true, according to pediatric dentists at the Medical College of Georgia who found that children who used "orthodontic pacifiers" had just as many dental abnormalities as those who used ordinary pacifiers or their thumb. Therefore, both prolonged thumb sucking and pacifier uses are equal in producing large orthodontic bills for the parents. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  There are other reasons for not using pacifiers. First, pacifiers frequently carry many wonderful bacteria, and in the case of yeast infections (thrush), the ailment is difficult to eradicate as long as parents insist on reinserting the pacifier every time it falls out. The use of pacifiers after 12 months has been shown to interfere with normal babbling and speech development <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  Should the child need extra sucking, as some do, why not let them use nature’s pacifier, their thumb. According to pediatrician Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, "the thumb is always there, and the child can use it whenever they want. The baby who can comfort themselves will become an easier baby to parent." The thumb’s value lies in its being controlled by the child, and not a technique learned by the child at the insistence of the parent. The child given a pacifier for fussing or crying never learns how to comfort themselves. "It’s a stressful world for small children," Dr. Brazelton writes in his new book Touchpoints:The Essential Reference, "and thumb sucking is a healthy sign of competence, a sort of self-comforting way of managing the stresses."<br>  <br>  The overuse of pacifiers teaches our children, "Don’t call me, I’m busy." "Stop crying, I do not want to hear you when you cry." What we don’t think about is that this subtle message may tell our children that we are not there for them. The pacifier, despite its name, should not substitute for vital communication -talking, playing and interacting- between parent and child. Resist the temptation to use the pacifier as a constant tranquilizer, automatically popping the plastic and rubber sucker into the child’s mouth as the quickest and easiest remedy for fretfulness or crying. Instead, moms and dads might want to consider other alternatives, like hugging your baby, rocking the infant in a chair, or just talking to your child. A child who cries has a need, and you’re not going to spoil them with a little holding or cuddling. And remember, they are only young once and will grow up before you know it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&action=detail&ref=856" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>   How old is too old?<br>  <br>  According to the American Dental Association, thumb sucking does not cause permanent problems with the teeth or jaw line unless it is continued beyond 4 to 5 years of age. As it turns out, somewhere between 85% and 99% of children have finished thumb sucking spontaneously before this period.<br>  <br>  Which children keep sucking their thumbs?<br>  <br>  Many parents are concerned that thumb sucking at a late age is a sign of emotional immaturity or lack of self-confidence. When investigators have looked at late thumb suckers for common traits, they found only one thing in common that distinguished them from other children -- a prolonged history of a strong battle with thumb sucking at an earlier age. It is striking that many well-meaning parents have actually encouraged thumb sucking by trying to forcibly take the thumb out of their children's mouths. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detthumb.h...</a><br>  Once the baby is born, however, the suckling instinct is supposed to be directed toward the breast, to get the child nutrition and immunities, and the sucking itself lowers the baby's heart rate and blood pressure. While it can be convenient for the parents to have the baby suck on their thumb or fingers or pacifier (like in the car on trips, or when mother is trying to cook dinner) it nevertheless is clear from both cross-cultural and cross-species field studies that, given complete contact with mother and free access to the breast on demand, human children (and young of our close relatives, the great apes) do not suck on their thumbs or fingers. I never saw a child in Mali sucking its thumb or fingers, in almost three years of watching/observing/studying mother-child interactions. Likewise, thumb sucking is reported to be completely absent from cultures such as the Navajo, in highland Papua New Guinea, Ecuador, the Peruvian Andes, Mexico, Nepal, India, Tanzania, Botswana, and South Africa. A number of other ethnographic studies of breastfeeding don't mention thumb sucking one way or another.<br>  |`|vCWVimTzaa	she will let you know when she is hungry! My babies both had a very strong need to suck and both of them sucked their hands before they were born. The lactation nurse actually suggested that I give my son a pacifier because it would help him learn to reposition his tongue as he was used to sucking on his little tiny fingers and was having a hard time opening wide and getting a good latch to nurse. My daughter I was stubborn with, and didn't want her to have a pacifier because I had been told it would interfere with breast feeding, but my mom finally convinced me to give her one and said it never interfered with me when I was a baby. Sure enough, it freed me from being used as a human pacifier and she  nursed just fine. then at 11 months she gave it up on her own. she still takes one at night, but I have no doubt that when she is ready she will give that up too. although latley she has been sucking her fingers or stealing her brothers pacifier, but i think thats due to adjusting to a newborn in the house than anything else. I would go ahead and try the pacifier with your daughter. they have been great for my 2!

I like Grayson Alexander Cooley. Try mixing around middle and first names and putting them in different places.<br>  <br>  Noah Declan Cooley - Yes it has become very popular (see second source)<br>  Spencer Ryan Cooley - Spencer has decreased in popularity and is quite nice. I also like the name Ryan.<br>  Chase Maddox Cooley- I don't like Maddox at all. Yes they will think you have copied.<br>  I like Spencer Ryan because it has a nice flow and suites younger children and an adult. I also like Chase Ryan Cooley.<br>  <br>  Zoila ' Zoe ' Emalyn Cooley - Zoila is quite strange. She will probably spend her whole life correcting people about it. I like Zoe too but your right about it not suiting your last name.<br>  Margret ' Molly ' Katherine Cooley - Yes definitley sounds like a old lady. You have also spelt Margaret in a strange way. I don't like Katherine. <br>  Aniston ' Annie ' Meah Cooley - I like this name. It flows well. I don't think it is too close to the other names and people wouldn't refer to her as Jennifer Aniston.<br>  Nova Madelyn Cooley - This is really cool!! It is quite different but different is 'in'. Nova is quite popular in Sweden.<br>  Adelyn ' Addie ' Michelle Cooley- No definitely not!! This is beautiful and unique.<br>  Gemma Riley Cooley - Yes too much 'lee' Gemma is rather popular too.<br>  <br>  Sooo... My top three are:<br>  Adelyn ' Addie ' Michelle Cooley<br>  Nova Madelyn Cooley<br>  Aniston ' Annie ' Meah Cooley<br>  <br>  Goodluck with the twins!!! I hope I've helped.<br>  I also like the names:<br>  Poppy Jean<br>  Anais (A-neigh) Lee<br>  Mikayla Rose<br>  Max Ryan<br>  Toby James<br>  and<br>  Sophia (So-fire)|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	grayson charles-Love It!<br>  mason william-Love It! Not too popular, besides school is 5 yrs. away, things change.<br>  kingston alexander-don't like kingston, reverse maybe.I'm sorry!<br>  chase maddox-i like each one sepaarately, not together.don't worry about what others think!Chase Alexander/Maddox Lee.<br>  Mason William is my fave there!<br>  Zoila Emalyn is catchy!<br>  Margret Catherine is wonderful/classic,yes it's ok for Molly.I love it!<br>  Aniston Meah-Love It! It would be a great combo w/ the others I think.<br>  I dislike Nova entirely, sorry.<br>  Adelyn is quite common as is Atalie/Matelyn.It's great!<br>  I dislike Gemma entirely, sorry.<br>  I would choose Adelyn out of the girl's names.<br>  I switch the name w/ Declan the other way.I'd choose declan,Grayson, and Mason out of all the boys names.Adelyn/Aniston/Margret would be my combo of choice for the girls.Congrats!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I like Grayson Charles the best cuz of the name Grayson, I think it’s so cute, Graydon is cuter IMO, but Grayson is really cute too.<br>  Kingston Alexander is the 2nd best – Kingston is cute and I really like Alexander.<br>  Mason William is cute too, but my least fav of the 3 – Mason is cute and William is ok.<br>  <br>  Chase Maddox is my fav of those, cuz Maddox is my son's name, and don't worry about what others think (i didn't care that Brad and Angelina had a son named that, lol they don't own the name), if u like it then that's all that matters.<br>  I really lik Noah Declan too, cuz i really like Noah and Declan is one of my fav boys names.<br>  Spencer Ryan is my least fav of all the boys names, i like Ryan (its one of my nephews names)  but i don't really like Spencer.<br>  <br>  If it's 3 boys I'd go with Grayson Charles, Chase Maddox, and Noah Declan.  I think they sound adorable together.<br>  <br>  I like Nova Madelyn the best of the girls names, cuz I really like both Nova and Madelyn and they sound cute together.<br>  Adelyn ' Addie ' Michelle is really cute too, Adelyn is really cute and Michelle is ok, but works well with Adelyn.<br>  Gemma Riley is so cute and while it has the same ending sound as ur last name I think it still sounds cute and works. Gemma is really cute and Riley is one of my fav girls names.<br>  <br>  Aniston ' Annie ' Meah – Aniston is cute but yea she may get associated with Jennifer Aniston, but it’s still cute and so I wouldn’t worry about that.  And Meah is ok, but not my fav.<br>  Margret ' Molly ' Katherine – And yea I think it does sound too old like, and not sure if Molly can be a nickname for Margret, never heard it used like that lol but that doesn’t mean it can’t be.<br>  Zoila ' Zoe ' Emalyn – Sorry but I don’t like Zolia I think it just is a bit too weird, Zoe is really adorable though and one of my fav girls names, and I think it sounds fine with ur last name lol but that’s just me.  Emalyn is really cute and diff.<br>  <br>  If it’s 3 girls I’d go with Nova Madelyn, Adelyn ' Addie ' Michelle, and Gemma Riley.  I think they sound adorable together.<br>  <br>  If it’s 2 boys and a girl I’d go with Grayson Charles, Chase Maddox, and Nova Madelyn.<br>  If it’s 2 girls and a boy I’d go with Nova Madelyn, Adelyn ' Addie ' Michelle, and Grayson Charles or Chase Maddox.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|lbThMxj7aa	Mason<br>  Noah ( I don't care for Declan for the middle name)<br>  <br>  Margret does sound like a old lady.  I like Aniston, but not Annie.<br>  I also like Zoe.  I'm sorry, I don't like the rest of the names because they are so different.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	Adelyn, Grayson, Paxton instead of Maddox|`|hxUXjg1faa	I just have to say I love Nova it's so cute =). <br>  I also like Noah and Grayson.|`|T6H5r54Aaa	"Declan" reminds me of the character on "Kyle XY." "Spencer Ryan" sounds like someone my age (21): those names have waned in popularity over the past couple of decades.<br>  <br>  Kingston sounds pretentious. <br>  <br>  "Yes" on the Maddox question, and "Aniston." Someone else just asked about Aniston--definitely "trendy," not a classic name. <br>  <br>  I would not think of Adelyn/Madelyn, because I think it should be spelled "Madeleine." It seems more like Addison+Lynne, to me.<br>  <br>  I like MargAret, and yes, Molly can be a nickname. Doesn't sound like an old lady at all.<br>  <br>  Zoila . . . a little weird. Now *that* sounds old-lady-ish.<br>  <br>  Top 3 of the boys' you listed here: William, Alexander, Noah<br>  Girls': Katherine, Molly, MargAret (don't like Margret. Looks misspelled from the get-go to me.)<br>  <br>  The website below is great for researching trends in names, their perceptions, what names go together, what is trendy vs. classic, etc.|`|BOJEbnCtaa	Grayson is a great name. I don't know but one person with this name.<br>  Mason is also a great name I love it paired with William.<br>  Kingston.. I think it sounds like a dog name<br>  Noah Declan.. I love it. Noah is a good clean name.<br>  Spencer Ryan is my favorite so far. I think it flows well.<br>  Chase Maddox.. I think it flows well. Who cares if you copied? It's your child?<br>  Zoila.. I don't like it. it is weird<br>  Margret sounds old lady<br>  Aniston.. I love it.<br>  Nova.. I wouldn't want to be named after a car.<br>  Adelyn Michelle is awesome.

As for girls I love. Adalyn, Maragaret and Jemna|`|QWTLw9DEaa	Ok my opinion: So many of your names are too out there.<br>  do not do any of the following:<br>  Aniston, Zoila, Nova, or Kingston<br>  <br>  I love Mason William, Margaret Katherine, and Noah Chase (just a suggestion) Grayson Charles is ok<br>  other suggestions for your names:<br>  <br>  Kingston Alexander to Kendrick Alexander<br>  Spencer Ryan to Ryan Alexander<br>  Zoila Emalyn to Zoe Emma<br>  Aniston Meah to Annabel Mia (I love this nickname Annie)<br>  Nova Madelyn to Nora Madeline<br>  Adelyn Michelle to Madelyn Rachel<br>  Gemma Riley to Gemma Kylie<br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|u7UnUZXnaa	Grayson Charles Cooley is my favorite because it's the cutest(:<br>  Noah Declan Cooley is my favorite because i'm in love with that name.<br>  i love the name Molly, but not Margaret. just name her Molly Katherine Cooley... it sounds gorgeous!<br>  Adelyn is so cute<3 i absolute love the nickname Addie. you could even name her Addison.<br>  i like you should switch Riley and Gemma so it's Riley Gemma Cooley. i love the name Riley<3 it's adorable.
GiJPyqF2aa	It looks like you have already made your decision, but I wouldn't go either. You probably wouldn't have that great of a time because you would be concerned with how you feel and finding a place to rest. Don't worry about your mom and grandmother. It has been awhile since they were 35 weeks pregnant so they might have forgotten how it feels. :) Get used to people thinking you're crazy too. Everyone seems to have an opinion about what you should or shouldn't do and how you should or shouldn't do it. As my doctor told me when I was 10 weeks pregnant, "Do what's normal." If not going feels like the right thing for you, don't go.|`|lSiv5PDlaa	it sounds a bit risky i personally wouldnt do it i mean you have to think would you be able to recieve the care you need in the destination, if flying is involved its a definate NO you would not be able to recieve help on a flight, no docs,etc<br>  i would postpone until ive had my child<br>  if thats out of the question and the memories and benefits are greater than the risks GO FOR IT other-wise go by your gut feeling|`|9ZaoTkwwaa	I wouldn't do it.  I wouldn't feel comfortable not knowing where the nearest hospital was at any given time and not being able to go to my drs office.  That may be just me but if they say not to fly anywhere too close to birth, i wouldn't want to drive either.  But i think you should just do what your dr says.  That's good that you were already planning on asking.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I wouldnt take the chance...first your far along enough u could possible go into labor...then u will have to drive or even just be sitting down for a long period of time that wont be comfortable...and sightseeing sounds like walking and that might be uncomfortable...i wouldnt go because i know i would end up stressed and i wouldnt want to take the chance an go into labor!|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	I would ask your doc, but I personally would not venture that far from home so close to your date. Plus the driving could increase your chances of blood clots in the legs according to my OB. Good luck!|`|0WuazQJYaa	You could definitely go into labor at 35 weeks especially with the added stress of the trip. I'm guessing your doctor will probably tell you know. Good luck with the baby!|`|kvYgopThaa	No i wouldn't go. you could go into labor at anytme and it would be best if you were around your doctors and you would probally feel more comfortable.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	I don't know. Maybe if I knew there would be things to keep me occupied while they treked around. Just talk to your dr like your planning on doing, and follow what your gut says! Congrats by the way!|`|BtSyX2nVaa	i was around 35 to 34 weeks pregnant and hurricane gustav was coming and was going to hit us. i asked my doctor if it was safe to evacuate or just put me in the hospital and he said leave...i was in the car for about 18hrs because of the traffic...im sure it maybe find just because if you do end up going into labor no hospital can deny you that have to take you.....but i probably wouldnt do much site seeing i mean i did but i got very tired after awhile....<br>  so you maybe fine if you go but i dont know so like you said i would check with your OB first|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Nope,  I also doubt your OB will approve of travel this far along in the game. <br>  <br>  My midwife said no traveling farther then 1 hour away when I hit 32 weeks.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	At 35wks pregnant, no I wouldn't. I couldn't take a 45min trip in the car at 35wks and had preterm labor at 34wks which was completely unexpected. My legs swelled like water balloons on the drive to work, 30min, so I can't imagine driving 700 miles.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	I'm pretty adventurous, but I don't think I'd go.  I'd take it easy those last weeks.  All the driving alone would make me bonkers.  I think if it was closer to home it would be easier, but I wouldn't want to be that far from home.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	It would be hard to pass up this vacation....but I personally, would not go.  You never know what could happen at 35 weeks...why take the chance?  Put the baby first!<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|C55pji5Qaa	No way,with my luck something would definitely happen!|`|8j7FCEOraa	You want to be miles away from home, your hospital and your doctors during your 8th month?<br>  Does it sound like a good idea?<br>  What happens if theres a complication? Or a premature birth? You dont have anything with you. (Clothes/ Bottle/formula/Diapers/Car seat/Baby wipes/Some towels?)<br>  Plus at this point you should be resting. Stress and unnecessary fatigue on the body aren't needed right now.<br>  No, you should suck it up and sacrifice the trip for the sake of your baby. Welcome to being a parent, it doesn't matter what you want anymore!|`|j9axB0YMaa	There is no way in hell I would go. Sitting in a car that long sounds horrible. I have a feeling your Dr. will say no. I am 33 weeks and I was given a no travel after date of sometime in Jan. You've gotta think if something was to happen when you where out of town it would be very scary not knowing where to go.|`|Py3XJc8saa	I wouldn't do it because of the stress and it might be a bit risky.. but if your doctor thinks it's a good idea and you really want to go, then you should go.|`|nsYRh67daa	personally i wouldn't go. if you do id definitely bring your hospital bag just in case your cutting it close 40 weeks is full term but i had my daughter a week early.|`|QJ7ogJloaa	nooo, i wouldnt because you are too close to your due date and you could go into labor while you are on the trip.|`|u8C7GNLcaa	i dont think its stressful its just really risky|`|BJzhuAGWaa	no. not at alll......|`|MXXOICquaa	i think its a little late to be going on vaction and since your so far you should stop and stretch atleast every hour which means it will take longer to get to wherever your going and u could also go into labor do you really want to have your baby away from home and have to make the trip back with a newborn and i just dont think you should be driving that much while your that far along|`|k4x4uSNJaa	even without the stress there is always the possibility you walk alot and end up in labor and then your how far away from home. and what if your hiking and go into labor are they going to carry you to the car? and how far from the dr are you going to be? i wouldn't take the risk of harming yourself or the baby due to the distance you could/would be from a medical facility! and at 35 weeks its possible to go into labor. think about it in just two weeks you can choose to be induced! if you are a very active person or if someone in your family has medical experience then with those two circumstances i might but other than that i wouldn't risk the possibility of having my baby so far away from home! id be sitting on my butt waiting for the little guy to say its ready! and when he is out you can always travel!
tcHkn0VIaa	No worries hun. I know you are anxious but it is really standard, due to the risks in the first trimester most Dr's don't really start prenatal care until the second trimester. as long as you are taking prenatal vitamins you are doing all that you can, My first actual apt was at 13 weeks and i got to hear the heart beat and asked all my questions- it was still just a nurse practitioner but sometimes i think they know more than the actual Dr.s do! you will be fine. I was born in the naval hospital in Jacksonville Fl. 24 years ago and i turned out fine and so did my mother (however my younger brother and sister were not born in the military hospital!) good luck :)|`|l46COY9eaa	OH G*D PLEASE don't say Balboa Naval Hospital! I will be having to go there! (Now if this is Portsmouth Naval, I can believe it...they are awful!)|`|yKS2UI87aa	Call or go in until you get an answer. Be persistant. If that doesn't work try calling a nurse hotline. God I'd have been pissed and wouldn't have left at all!|`|5puE2Qfpaa	Basically same procedure other doctors have. I will be 10 weeks and 6 days on March 12th when I finally get my first ob appointment. Do to some spotting they did an early u/s on me at 6 1/2 weeks.|`|Jf3DIPcNaa	I was somewhere in my 10th week the first time I saw a doctor. My first appointment (at 9 weeks) was pretty much the same: blood draw and a bunch of papers to fill out. Nobody to answer any pregnancy questions or anything. I think some offices are just that way. Procedure. I felt the same way, kind of annoyed and frustrated and anxious to get a real doctor visit and see how my baby was doing. Hang in there. It'll be here before you know it. Until then, read a bit about pregnancy and have a list ready of things you want to talk to the doc about. And if you have any concerns or problems before that appt, don't hesitate to call and ask questions.|`|kSjHLJI8aa	a lot of military hospitals are like that. my first appt. with both of my pregnancies were in the army hospitals and they were just so cold. like they didn't care. i know how u feel. so anyways my first appt's were just paperwork and blood work too. and some doctors wont see you til after you're first trimester bkuz of miscarriages. and my two pregnancies while my husband was in the army were miscarriages. and wow i'm just rambling. but ummm...yeah i'm at a civilian hospital now with my third pregnancy and they didnt see me til after my first trimester either. lol. sorry. i'm such a rambler.|`|bZNJU6ywaa	You should have attended some type of welcome briefing in the OBGYN clinic where you are given all sorts of information on the services the clinic and hospital provide, and be given the chance to ask questions. If you feel your experience is unfair or just wrong, I would go to the TriCare office and file a complaint. SOMEONE should have been at least courteous enough to explain the procedures to you, such as why you have to wait until your first trimester is over! That's BS, because a lot can happen in those first few weeks! I was being taken care of at National Naval in Bethesda and they were superb. Be advised that if you have a "normal" pregnancy (i.e. no gestational diabetes, hypertension) then you'll only be seen a handful of times before you give birth.

Knc43SOvaa	This is just my opinion but, even though your husband is wanting another one i wouldn't suggest doing it yet.<br>  <br>  your baby girl is only 3 months old so i think it would be a little early to try to have another one since you do have high blood pressure. but i have 2 girls that are 16 months apart and there are advantages and disadvantages to having kids close together.                                       <br>  <br>  <br>  anyhow if you and your husband both decide you want another one go for it but i wouldn't just do it for him i think it has to be something that you both want. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|AA11828439	Be honest with him. You should NEVER have had a child "For him". That is not a good reason to bring a child into this world.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	Ill give you three ways<br>  1. Say no and cry.<br>  2. Say the second one isn't even yours.<br>  3. Tell him to please wait till the first one leaves.
PDHCOrOSaa	I have a twin brother and sister ( 9 almost 10 months ) and they were just about full term but low birth weight ( about 4 lbs ).<br>  <br>  They can get up on their hands and knees and rock but they still don't sit up.  They seem a little behind.  I guess their doc said the low birth weight should not effect their development at all but I think different.<br>  <br>  My daughter is 13 ( almost 14 months ) and she didn't sit up till 9 months nor did she crawl.  Then she army crawled from 9 -11 months and all of a sudden walked!  She is such a smart kid.  She says a lot of words...walks very well, and is right...if not above target on her development for her age right now.<br>  <br>  Of course I would see the doctor but I wouldn't automatically assume somethings wrong with her....maybe she's just going to be a tad behind for a while.|`|V6slDthdaa	They could, but it's not always the case. There could be an underlying problem, or she could be perfectly normal. Talk it over with her doctor, he'll help you set the guidelines.
qHwI9ev8aa	By the time your baby hits 8 months, her growth will level off a bit. Don't worry if she isn't going up right now, as long as she's drinking well and doesn't seem hungry, she'll be fine.<br>  <br>  My little one had some constipation problems too, lots of babies do, especially if they're given supplemental iron (breastfed babies really don't need this). To help with the constipation you can feed your baby pureed prunes, I think Gerber or Earth's Best sells them. She will eventually have no trouble processing solids.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	Oh dear, it sounds as if you're letting yourself get stressed out over "recommended guidelines".  I did that during my pregnancy and now that my son is here I see that it was all for naught.  If she seems like she's fine and given the fact that you and your husband are on the small to slim side that is likely the case with your daughter.  Good Luck and try not to worry.  If your doctor isn't concerned then I wouldn't stress over it.  God Bless!|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My doctor told me that my baby needed mostly breastmilk, but needed more calories when she started crawling.  She told me that if I was breastfeeding exclusively, I'd have to feed her every 1-2 hours to give her the number of calories she needed at 8 months.  I work full time so that wasn't an option.  If you can do it, go for it.<br>  We had problems with the constipation also, and started giving her applesauce every morning, or prunes, after her morning feeding, and after a few weeks, she started having regular bowel movements.  The constipation gets better after they start crawling also, because they get everything "moving".  <br>  My baby was a preemie, and weighed 5 lbs, when born.  At 6 months, she was 15 lbs.  Right now, at 10 months, she's at 17 lbs, so there wasn't as much weight gain between 6-10 months, as there was the first 6 months.|`|83nHy2PXaa	it could be both slow weight gain and also that she might need more calories than your breast milk can supply. She is crawling and spends a lot of energy. The main concern is the iron that breast milk can't provide in sufficient amount for the 8-months old.<br>  Besides, this is the age when the baby is offered different tastes and textures to experiment, it will make it easier for her to adjust later to the adult food.<br>  My son was breastfeed from birth till 6.5 months exclusively, and then we started on solids. Rice cereal constupated him as well, so I almost didn't give it to him. Oat and barley cereals were better. <br>  What did help a lot are sweet potatoes, some prune juice (mix it with water first - it was also an advise from our pediatrician), home-made cereals which naturally contain more fiber and help with constupation problems. Try to add to cereals you make some beans grounded to the powder for 2 minutes in the cofee grinder.<br>  Avoid bananas, rice cereal and give her solids moderately, there sjould be a balance between the breast milk and solids
qHwI9ev8aa	Yes, you can be ovulating before you start menstruating again. As soon as you are given the go-ahead for sex from your OB you are also advised to start using birth control. How long it takes for your system to "reboot" is different from person to person.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your new baby.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	Yes, its possible.   Use protection before getting your IUD in place.  That's what I was told to do.  <br>  Putting Mirena in a pregnant women can be dangerous and most likely will result in a miscarriage.  If you have had unprotected sex, their is a chance you could be pregnant, so be sure to mention this to your doctor before getting mirena put in place.  <br>  I know usually they like to put Mirena in while you are menstruating, because your cervix is already slightly dilated.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	yup you sure can. you are more fertile after giving birth too!|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Yes you can, because your cycle is so messed up there is no telling when you'll ovulate. You aren't supposed to get an IUD til after 6 weeks after giving birth...And where I went, you had to abstain from sex for 2 weeks prior to the insertion to make sure the pregnancy test they give you before hand is accurate. It's VERY easy to get pregnant right after giving birth. Ask my cousin who has boys 10 months apart because she thought she could have sex and not worry since she hadn't had her period yet.|`|kY29gYhjaa	ladies are at their most fertile for 6 weeks after birth, my nan went to her post natal check up 50 years ago (she had not yet resumed menstral cycle) and doc said i am not going to talk to you about contraception as you are already pregnant, she punched him and walked out, 8 months later along came my uncle lol!|`|cQDEjeZ7aa	Yes you can. Theres a huge chance if you have unprotected sex right after giving birth you can get prego again.|`|2HX9sIwpaa	yes you can! i have a 4 month yr old daughter and i'm already pregnant with my 2nd child who is 8 weeks in my tummy.|`|6qCnpxrNaa	Oh absolutely!  You can definitely get pregnant soon after giving birth.  My medical team was quite adamant about that and I know a couple women who had that happen.  Although, I confess that I'm amazed they were feeling so "romantic" that soon.  haha :)|`|QWfkHyUeaa	yes you can get pregnant... i had sex 11 days after giving birth and fell pregnant again, but unfortunately i miss carried at three months, probably because my body was not ready at all.... it is possible.|`|YTYrg3qlaa	yes you can ..<br>  <br>  Congrats!! :D|`|dW4DbkCLaa	Yes, it's easier to get pregnant at this time.|`|WCDaIP2Yaa	of course!
uXAV4wP0aa	It's a bit extreme but since you've already done everything I would have done...<br>  <br>  Talk to your local police station (it's sounds silly, I know. But bear with me). I have an 8 year old cousin who was stealing silly things like your daughter but then she started stealing things like cell phones. So her dad called the cops to see if they'd be willing to help him out. They were. They picked her up and put her in the back of the squad car, drove around the block and had a little talk with her. Ever since she hasn't stolen anything! <br>  <br>  If you don't want to go that far or the police aren't able to help, you might want to just bring her down to the jail for a tour. And tell her if she keeps stealing she might end up there. <br>  <br>  It's a bit crazy but it works!|`|P4LBygv2aa	start stealing her things , she'll learn , she won't like others taking her stuff .|`|Lx8O0n0vaa	well i wouldnt have a butt left if i'd done that.just a idea.i'm not saying abuse her but if she gets put in jail later in life for stealing a spanking wouldnt seem so bad compared to what could happen in there.|`|7DG99jUnaa	hey put her to sit down and have a serious talk with let her know it the last time and there will be consciences to her actions .hey don't argue just talk you be surprised.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Ok well, are you sure she isn't just hungry? So i guess i would see if she wants more food at morning/ lunch/ afternoon tea times. But i think what your doing is great. I don't really know how you could improve on that. Good Luck.|`|LSJyE4d0aa	You may not like my answer... I think stealing is something that has to be nipped in the bud, because when she is older and doing it, it will be the police you are dealing with. I do not really think spanking is necessary with older children, however, I think this is the punishment I would use. It makes an impression, especially if it is not used a lot. <br>  The next time it happens I would pull her aside to her room or something and have a talk with her. Tell you love her and hate to see her steal because she is better than that. Just reinforce how wrong it is on so many levels. Then I would tell her since she is doing something she knows is wrong, she is going to be punished. I would then give her the spanking. If you sit down and talk with the child, and she sees you are disappointed in what she has done, and then you punish the wrongdoing, most of the time they will shape up. Explanation, punishment, explanation and verbal correction, forgiveness and lots of love is my method. Spanking may break your heart, but I think it is very effective in such situations|`|uxNE7O1gaa	with loud angry screaming and gun threats!!!!!!!!!!  <br>  or simply buy your poor child cookies dumbass|`|chEtiwiVaa	It seems that you are felling very scared for your daughter and you are worried that she might continue to steal as she gets older. This is not true. Social cognitive researchers emphasize that what children (ages 7-10)  do in one situation (stealing) is often only weakly related to what they will do in other situations. Therefore, it would be very hard to predict if she will steal in other peoples homes. Keep in mind that I've read a lot of research in this area and it is normal for your daughter to lie at this age too. All children lie and your child will do this so be prepared. Research has proven that no child is honest all the time. <br>  <br>  Many 10 year old's can't think in the same way as adults because her brain is still developing. She would not even be able to tell you at this point if breaking 12 cups accidentally is worse than breaking one cup intentionally! You really need to worry if she does become physically aggressive towards others, often losses her temper, blaming others for her mistakes, argues with you, and is often angry and vindictive. If you find that she is doing any of these behaviors, please get her into therapy!<br>  <br>  The only advice that I can give you at this time is to reward her when she follows the rules that you have put in place. Tomorrow, I would calmly tell her that if she steals the cookies again that you will implement certain consequences. However, If you tell her when you are angry or annoyed, she will not listen. Her amygdale in her brain will inhibit her ability to encode your directions. Please be consistent and take away all her toys each time she does this or she will become confused. I'm sure you know all this. <br>  <br>  Also, I have read that children at her age should not be spanked as it has a direct effect on her how many neuron's fire in her brain. When a neuron does not fire it dies. Children who have not been spanked often are found to have higher IQ's than children who have been swatted. <br>  <br>  It's ok to feel frustrated with this behavior and I hope you seek help from a licensed child psychologist. I would contact you local community mental health clinic or health care provider. <br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that your daughter is only nine years old which means that she does not think that taking a cookie is morally wrong. I would recommend that you purchase a child development book. You would then have a good idea as to why she behaves in these unexpected ways. <br>  <br>  Finally, Children usually grow up with their parent's moral values intact. This means that your manners will most likely rub off on your daughter. Just keep letting her know how her behavior affects you! <br>  <br>  I hope you and your husband find the help and support in learning how to best deal with your daughter.<br>  <br>  Mel<br>  <br>  I'm currently working toward my doctorate (Psy.D) degree in clinical Psychology. I have a B.A. in psychology as well and I have been studying child development for 3 years.

GYoNyoWtaa	Getting CPR and First Aid Certificate is very reassuring for a parent. You can get that through your local Red Cross, and renew it every 3 years. <br>  <br>  Also experience is very good. It's kind of difficult if you are just starting the babysitting scene, but if you have experience with younger siblings, or helping out in the nursery at church, or volunteering with the younger kids in an elementary school, that's all very helpful. <br>  <br>  Parents want someone that will be interactive, and not ditzy. Although some parents are ok with letting their kid zone out in front of the tv the whole time, I know when I babysat as a teen, they really appreciated if I did activities with them. Coloring books, taking them to the park, playing games.<br>  <br>  Ask questions. That shows that you truly care for the best interest for the child. Questions such as: Any food allergies? If I can't get a hold of you, who is the next person to call? What does he/she enjoy doing? How would you like me to discipline if he/she happens to misbehave? <br>  <br>  Also, DON'T text/talk on the phone when you are babysitting, or talking to a parent. You want to show that when you are babysitting, it's all about you and the kid(s), not about just sitting around, texting and chewing gum while the kid wrecks havoc. <br>  <br>  Be professional, dependable, and fun!|`|mFEevGRXaa	honestly i wouldn't let a 13 year old watch my child but if you are really wanting to do this i would make sure that you have some cpr training and activities for the children to do. there are certain rules and regulations that are involved with babysitting so just do some more research.|`|7TYuCafDaa	I would want someone with experience, has reliable transportation, is easily reached, and has taken a course to be a certified babysitter. (These are offered at schools and community centers). Also, they would have to be responsible and trustworthy. And no, I would not let 2 friends watch my daughter.
Osn1xpu6aa	I agree with you. Older bands are better for the "rock music."<br>  The newer, shitty bands like All Time Low (which I absolutely despise) or Fall Out Boy, are not rock and should be given the title "wannabe edgy alternative" or something. <br>  I listen to rock music like: <br>  The White Stripes<br>  The Raconteurs<br>  Nirvana<br>  Arctic Monkeys<br>  Brand New<br>  The Libertines<br>  Red Hot Chili Peppers|`|LTWlBSFNaa	um... rock|`|8Fn1tYaJaa	GRUNGE ROCK ARTISTS! <br>  <br>  Theory of a Deadman, Saliva, Papa Roach, Crossfade, Shinedown, tons tons more.<br>  <br>  15 years of age.|`|qif1TQtnaa	Well rock is rock.

fPFXJr3eaa	Hey just check this out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://apathoftheheart.blogspot.com/2009/01/january-23-2009-adoption-situations.html" rel="nofollow">http://apathoftheheart.blogspot.com/2009...</a><br>  <br>  and this is in the USA!  Supposedly costs are 'fees'... hmmm, 'fees' vary depend on race, sex etc.  Looks like child selling to me and yes I agree with you, price tags on kids heads are disgusting.|`|jQc3Y3Qtaa	all righty then. The cost for domestic adoption and the breakdown of costs is as follows.<br>  <br>              total cost $36,900<br>  <br>              legal fees and parental termination: $5,000<br>              birth mother expenses through pregnancy: $ 7500 <br>              birthmother aftercare 1 month: $1000<br>              interstate compact agreement $1000<br>              agency fee : $22,400<br>  <br>      That is for an at risk placement here in the us. i don't know about international adoption. This cost of course was prior to me as the father having knowledge. they have spent over $100,000 fighting me over the 2 1/2 years  of my daughters life and have failed to terminate me as a parent.selling babies is big bucks these days. these figures are current as of 2008. a garaunteed adoption can cost $10,000 to $25,000 more depending on the agency.|`|Jy2RF9Szaa	I don't usually answer the "money" questions, but...that's not the fee to the agency, that's the total expenses.<br>  <br>  We've adopted in Russia twice and, in our experience:<br>  -- Almost half of that is your travel costs (airfare, hotel, food, visa, driver in Russia, etc). For our most recent adoption, we were in Moscow (the most expensive city in the world) for 30 days across two trips.<br>  -- Almost 1/4 of that will be paid to US government agencies (for items you need to satisfy requirements on the US or Russian side, like: background checks, driving records, USCIS processing, fingerprinting, fire inspections, notarizations, certifications, and appostiles, etc.)<br>  -- The remaining 1/4–1/3 goes to the agency for their fees.<br>  <br>  It's still a lot of money and I think there are some people (and/or government departments) that are getting rich... but it doesn't all go to the agency.|`|c55O7jqXaa	My Sister and Brother in law adopted from Russia and they had to make two trips. One trip was to visit and stay for awhile and then come back home and wait the waiting period and then go back if they were asked back. The cost was around 30,000, but that was just for the trip and adoption and then they gave gifts and money to the orphanage and this is quite common to offer up gifts to support. It can get even higher than that in some places.|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	YUP.  Adoption is big business with children as the commodity.<br>  <br>  It's sick|`|nESfk0bXaa	No, it isn't right to buy children--so if you think it's wrong then don't do it.<br>  <br>  Should be a no brainer.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Ive heard pretty much that 30,000 is the minimum.  And a lot of countries want you spend a decent amount of time there also, so you would need a lifestyle or job with flexibility to do that.  As the above said, its a lot of legal paper work, background checks, etc.  (this is international, not sure on domestic)|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	You must be new here. <br>  Yes, it's expensive, you know the lawyers an "everyone" needs their money.|`|2wyDALHgaa	Nope.  It can cost $20,000 - $30,000 or more in some cases to adopt a child.  Kids you can buy from the farmer when ever his goat has babies.<br>  <br>  Then again, some international adoptions can be quite inexpensive if you are lucky enough to know the process and domestic adoptions can be free if you want to adopt through social services vice an agency.|`|7JEojMgQaa	Yes it's true but most of that paper work is the work it takes to shove the money into someones pocket, or deposit it into their personal bank account.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	yes it costs for all the legal fees...  afterall you'd be bringing a child into the USA... plus what they call foster care since russia does not have a social services as wonderful as we do here...|`|Mxr6AIkiaa	It can be. Or not. There are many paths to adoption, and some are free or nearly so - at least in monetary cost - and others are far from it.
MHOxPs8Oaa	Let him go to bed a little later. At least 9. I think 8:30 is a little early for a 9 year old. Also, nope my daughter is 20 months old goes to bed between 8 and 9 depending if she is more awake or not.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	They do, but kids need sleep, especially if they have school the next day.  My brother is 8, he can read from 7-8, but at 8 lights out.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Too bad if he doesn't like it. If he isn't tired it gives him time to review his day and daydream. Sleep for children has been cut in half over the past couple decades. They need more than they are getting. Keep up the good work Mom, you are doing him a favor. BTW he can lie to his friends about his bedtime if the issue even comes up.|`|G9ywiLqvaa	my 7-year old goes to bed at 930 on school nights and much later on weekends.  i'd understand why your son would be a little peeved.  this is the age of boundless energy.  give him time to wear himself out so sleeping will be a welcomed thing rather than a dreaded thing for him.<br>  <br>  just make sure he gets a good 8 to 10 hours sleep. :)|`|yGy5ZbKHaa	my 9 year old goes to bed at 9 he has a tv in his room and sometimes if he's good we let him watch tv till 9:30 or 10 if there's a show he really likes|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Wow...thats a bit early..<br>  when my sister was 9 (2 years ago)her bed time was 9:15pm|`|b1WMcGQ0aa	Yeah. My 5 year old is in bed no later than 8:00.

7PXFXcKfaa	lol your husband doesnt have hormones like you do - its impossible for him to worry as much!! <br>  <br>  Its really common for babies to go through a growth spurt at around 10 days to 2 weeks, so this sounds like it might be why hes up and eating so much! (another one comes at around 3-4 weeks too!!)<br>  <br>  In a growth spurt, a baby will be super tired for a few days, and this is when he does his growing (my PED told me babies can grow up to 1cm in a 24 hour period at this time!!) and in the days after they are super alert and super hungry. So these days your like omg whats wrong?! but really his tummy is just catching up to his newly grown self!<br>  <br>  Dont worry about it (i know easier said that done!) in the next few days hell return to normal ... whatever that is!! Also remember babies at this time change alll the time. Just when you think you have worked out whats going on, they change it! Damn!!!<br>  <br>  Also dont worry about asking stupid questions - husbands just dont have the built in worry gene that we have for our babies. <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope he gets some sleep soon!!!|`|J1ziLHTGaa	sounds incredibly normal.. he is a very new newborn and their sleeping patterns can be unpredictable, dont worry!|`|6nOhxCdsaa	very normal...who knows maybe he might sleep through most of the night b/c he was awake so much today...=)|`|avx7bLnKaa	if he is going through a growth spurt they eat alot more often and his sleep could just be messed up from this
yDWcYXl5aa	Men don't understand the not having any time off.  Next weekend, say, you've been working 24/7 for the past several years, and you need a day off, like he gets a weekend off.  (If he says he does stuff on the weekend, tell him you'll get groceries or something).  Take off early in the morning, and don't come home until after supper-time.  Tell him you're going to a parenting course to learn how to accept the job better.<br>  <br>  Before the day is through, even when he cheats by buying supper at McDonalds, when you ask him how he'd like to do it 24/7, with no days off, and no time away, maybe he'll change his mind.  At the same time, remember that he's got a lot on his plate to provide a living tosupport so many people.  Perhaps it's time to take on a part-time job, maybe waitresses lunch crowds on his day off?  Good luck!|`|FzS3aphWaa	Your husband works long hours and wants to come home to a pleasant and loving environment.  He expects that you are doing your job of taking care of the house and parenting the children while he works to support you and allows you to be a stay at home mom.<br>  <br>  You may need to consider working part time and hiring a care giver to take care of your children.  Your husband may be concerned about costs because his business will be affected by the economic downturn that we are experiencing now.  Working outside the home would allow you to have the money to spend on items that are necessary for you.  It might also alleviate the strain on your husband to provide all of the necessities.  It would give you a break from your children and allow you to interact with adults.  <br>  <br>  You also need to pay a babysitter to care for your children so that you and your husband can enjoy date nights.  If you remain at home, you may also need to arrange for care during the day so that you can take a break.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I had to demand help from my husband. I stopped asking him for things that I deserved like a shower alone every few days, and just do it. I wait until a reasonable time like when our son is fed and happy and tell him I am getting in the shower. Take your 15min and enjoy it so you are in a better mood. Join a mommy group, I found one on yahoo groups, and get out of the house at least once a week with the kids.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	You need to do what I did. My husband thought I had all this time to do errands and all this extra when I became a SAHM when our son was born and came home from the hospital with us.  I finally told him "I am going out. I don't know where but I am going to go and window shop and pick up some things at the market. I will be back later."  I left for about 4 hours and left him alone with a 2 month old who would wake to be fed every couple hours and a "honey do" list while I was gone (laundry, dishes, run the vaccuum downstairs all in addition to caring for little man).  I got home and brought back a quick dinner kit from the market and he got the point that he was under estimating all I really had to do in a day.  He hasn't bugged me since about doing this or that in my day by heaping on a load of extra. It gave him a new appreciation that I need time off in the day too. Now when he's home at the end of his day and we've eaten dinner as a family he takes care of cleaning the kitchen and taking over with our son for a couple hours so I can shower, relax and unwind for ME.  It has really helped. I look forward to those two hours each night so I can be relaxed and put our little one to bed in a better mood with my husband.

They are rich and don't care about anything but "ME, ME, ME".  They spend thousands of dollars on their 16th birthday on frivolous stuff while there are people out there who haven't had anything to eat in days and have no car and no house.  Then they cry if they didn't get the brand new car they wanted.  That show makes me so sick I won't watch it.|`|58XjVRFPaa	i would smack them until they realized you dont get everything you want in this world.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I would crawl away into a hole out of mortification if I ever found my child acting that way. I don't know what on earth is wrong with those parents. I feel bad for their kids because they didn't do them any favors in the long run. Those spoiled, selfish brats will never know what it's like to be happy. Only happy based on their possessions and their friends. It's sad and sickening. And before I crawled in my hole I'd tell my son a thing or two about life and how not to act.

X5e1h6Uzaa	Relax...seriously.  Freaking out only stresses you more and can delay a normal period.  <br>  <br>  So first things first:  it is almost impossible that if a condom broke on 2/17 that you would have a positive pregnancy test this early.  Sore boobs are normal during weaning, so I wouldn't worry about that at all and like you said, spotting and cramps could easily be a normal period since you are now weaning your baby.  However, if you had sex without being on birth control, you could be pregnant.  Breastfeeding is NOT a reliable method of birth control.  It takes about 2 weeks after egg fertilization to have a positive pregnancy test, so I would wait until 3/3 and then take a test...it will be much more accurate than any answer you could get in Yahoo! Answers.  Good luck!
52bAHCaUaa	Wow...TMI<br>  <br>  I think you and your husband should both want a second child, at the same time. I suggest you wait or speak to him about it again.|`|KICQQxLxaa	seriously?  You are quite sad.<br>  <br>  Pathetic...|`|NroZQN5vaa	Maybe you should talk to him about it. Maybe you can compromise and just wait until the one year old is potty trained?

If anything, being a mother has made me more self conscience. I get the feeling that people look at new mothers and assume they are supposed to look a certain way. Just because I am a mother doesn't mean that I have to be frumpy, in sweats with no trace of makeup, hair in a ponytail and covered in baby food. That is so not the case for me. I have started running everyday, make sure I wear make up so no one says "Oh, you look tired." <br>  I quit smoking the day I found out I was pregnant and I will never go back to that again.

714a3200277f638fc15c17685d2c32afaa	It could be too early to tell.  That's what happened with me.  I took 4 test all negative only to go the the doctor's a few days later to find out I was actually pregnant.|`|ebM6CxRQaa	Wait a few more days and retest... some women have a hard time getting their pregnancy hormones high enough to make a positive result... also ask the doctor to do a blood test... if you still do not get your period they can do an ultrasound to make sure there is no sac/baby. Some women never test positive with those tests (rare) and they assume they are not pregnant and get a surprise later! Always talk to your doctor they can help you with any of these questions and also being able to conceive and verifying if you are pregnant!|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	you could be still. take another one if your period is still late about 5 days. i took mine the day i was supposed to have my period too and it was negative. but then i waited a week and it was positive|`|RjdrO7DVaa	you might have just missed your ovulation date ... if you want a baby ... try the ovulation kits .. they really do work!|`|GLJkGgloaa	You probably missed your ovulation. I started my Period on Jan 28 Test Positive on Feb 22.|`|Coc593Ikaa	Well, from the dates you gave, it is likely that your egg was already dropped and dead by the time you had unprotected sex. So, you aren't likely pregnant.<br>  <br>  As for the test, you may have tested too early. These tests are 95% accurate once you have missed your period, but your irreguality adds some question as to whether you are rally late or not. Try testing again next week. Keep in mind that we miss periods for no reason sometimes!<br>  <br>  ADD: As for implantation bleeding, most people don't have it. I read that about 20% of women get this bleeding.
i2cZDC81aa	when your water breaks, it breaks. You don't know when it will, so no, you won't make it to the toilet in time. It is usually clear, and gushes if your uterus is not blocked by the baby. It is warm like urine. If the baby is blocking the uterus, sometimes it only trickles out.|`|yrDqtazLaa	When the water breaks, it's supposed to all come out quickly, if it's not, your bag is leaking. There's a lot of fluid, and it should be clear. If it's not clear, you would need to get to the hospital as soon as possible. It shouldn't be painful, and yes, very noticeable, it would be like peeing your pants really quickly.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I had allot of liquid when my waters broke. I even heard a slight "POP" just seconds before the water came out. I honestly thought I wet my pants! I didn't get any warning that my waters were about to break and once it started there was no stoping it all gushing out. 2 hours later I was holding my beautiful girl :) :) :)|`|yxeRpHDUaa	Apparently it's quite different for everyone so I can only tell you what I experienced...<br>  <br>  I was laying in bed and I had the sensation of an elastic band snapping and suddenly a while lot of liquid gushed out of me! There is no way I would have made it to a toilet. It didn't hurt at all. Unfortunately the liquid saturated the mattress so I have no idea what colour it was but it seemed to be fairly clear. <br>  <br>  I'm under the impression that for some women it's less of a gush and for others the hospital will end up breaking their waters for them. I was already in labour when mine broke naturally.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	If it completely breaks, it gushes and no ya don't have time to get to the toilet! It doesn't hurt and it was quite a bit with my pregnancies. With my first two the dr. ended up having to break my water to speed things up, that did not hurt. The third pregnancy I just started leaking and they told me to go on to the hospital, my water didn't completely break until right before my son was born, by then I didn't notice it, I was busy. You'll do great, don't worry!|`|uin3ffWDaa	it's like wetting you pants|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	when my water broke I had just laid down and it was a pretty big gush. It's usually clear. (if it isn't get to the hospital right away). I made it to the toilet ok. It is sort of thick. It isn't painful at all and usually contractions don't start right away. You really don't have time to think about it much when it happens.|`|ODJ9YWeAaa	it gushes out. and it doesnt keep gushing. its just one large gush that feels like you peed but you didnt. my water broke and it soaked the whole back of my pants and left a big water mark on the bed and it was just clear.  lol and theres no time to run to the bathroom. and its not painful. the contractions are the only painful ones. and giving birth. and when your water breaks it is VERY noticeable|`|M5jF5w5Taa	Mine broke while I was sleeping in bed, and I felt a pop! and sort of heard it too. No one believes me about that part. But I woke up and ran to the bathroom before the gush. It isn't really like urination because you can't control the flow.|`|FkBOqKWwaa	Well they broke my water and it felt like pressure....and its a lot like when you douche and it comes out all warm hehe... nothing scary...its cloudy in color.|`|Mejzhipyaa	it can be all of the above.
4TmcopjUaa	Hi.  Seems like you need a friend.  Your mother may have some underlying problems that need immediate attention.  There is a thin line between discipline and abuse.  In my opinion, the outbursts your mother has may be stepping over that line and leaning towards the abuse level.  Maybe, you should sit down with your mom (if at all possible and safe) and let her know what is bothering you.  I understand what it's like to grow up quickly and be your parent's rock.  It's hard, but teaches you independence and strength.  Do not look past this.  If you do not feel safe in the home with your mom, seeking help from a relative may be a good alternative.|`|BCgp7GTpaa	I dont think this is normal!!|`|AA10500537	it;s abuse but you should have told someone at least tell somone now|`|AMiQ1dlgaa	u could start smokeing|`|FIcUOgk6aa	Yupp this is abuse.<br>  Call child services  or your dad.|`|lJd5OET6aa	uhhhhhhhhhh wtf does the video have to do wit this|`|qLkknQx1aa	the physical part of what your mom is doing i would call abuse. the rest of it is her just losing control/fit of rage. she is not healthy. she sounds vindictive and calculating. if i were you i would seek help from other family members. maybe they can intervene on your behalf? sorry to hear of this.  it's very sad that you have to come on yahoo answers for help. you should be able to talk to your mom about how YOU feel.  i'm very sorry and i hope things get better for you.|`|s3pkM64faa	This  is not normal. It may be normal to your mom because that is how she may have been treated, I don't know the situation. I would probably try to talk to someone with your mom. It sounds like she may need the help.Be safe and find someone who can help.|`|c612db5f7eaf689dc523cb1c679189e1aa	sounds like mommy dearest!|`|NjGeH0wKaa	whats done is done|`|fvtVXYA2aa	You should consult with a phych|`|Q5eLg9Hvaa	Sorry to hear that. I wouldn't put up with that if I were your father. I dated a girl who I later found out had a violent temper. I had to kick her out. The behavior you describe would not be tolerated by me. It is not normal for Mommy to hit Daddy, or Daddy to hit Mommy, or the kids. Physical violence actually occurs in 25% of relationships and is perpetrated 70% of the time by women, according to the Harvard Medical School. It's normal for some people, but, like I said, I wouldn't put up with it.|`|c5068603ce14825332c2f7bfb7b4b118aa	Yes I would say there is abuse going on, with physical, Verbal and emotional abuse. Sounds as though your mother has some mental issues she needs to confront before she really hurts someone. Try to talk with some family memebers and see what you can come up with for preventive measures. See if you could possibly get her into some kind of counseling and get yourself into some to. I am sorry to hear what you are going through and will pray for you and your family. Good luck.
AA12320776	Sounds good to me..be sure that its what you want...find someone you want to spend your life with, then you can think of children.  <br>  <br>  Don't rush it!|`|7AtxrHQnaa	I don't think there is a magic number.  It's different for everyone.|`|Lth8UVJfaa	Yea I agree about the maturity level but....if i had to choose i would say married - 25 <br>  baby - 27|`|BCgp7GTpaa	I agree with you.|`|jGiYcSh9aa	I'm not really that much of a fan of marriage. I mean I don't think it's a bad thing, but I don't see why you can't just be in a committed relationship with someone and leave it at that. It's not like the relationship is going to be any better just because you and you partner have wasted money on a wedding and have written your names down on a certificate. Maybe my look on marriage is pessimistic because my parents went through such a bad divorce that they don't even speak to each other anymore.<br>  <br>  28-32 in my opinion is the ideal time to have children. I think having children under 25 isn't good and particularly under 21 is really not good. My dad's girlfriend has just turned 20 and she's pregnant and I think she isn't going to be a very good mother.|`|OEMIkJTUaa	I got married at 22, and hoping to have my first baby by the time I am 24. I don't think there is a "best" age. It really depends on your maturity level, your relationship, and things that are going on in your life.|`|fvtVXYA2aa	25. If your spouse dies, you have time to get married again.|`|AA10500537	different ages for different people  <br>  everyone is different|`|1enIWBGnaa	Your plans sound great!  Right age and smart too!|`|pnL5WTXMaa	hallelujah! someone that makes sense. i had almost given up. (at least with regard to the order anyway).|`|BvfjmHnTaa	yeah ur right|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	that's wise, really age doesn't matter, get your education first, travel the world and be able to support yourself, then think of having kids.<br>  <br>  I did. Married at 28, 1st kid at 29, last kids at 35.|`|c6RGmMGjaa	Well I had my son at 19 and have never been married...disapprove or not that's just how it happened and I don't regret it at all. Everyone is different but it doesn't make them better or worse people because of their age or marital status. To answer your specific question I would say the 'best' time is early to mid twenties to have a child, with marriage it doesn't really matter.

AND EXCERCISE. youre preparing for the biggest work out of your life.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	eat more fruits why? because they're lower in calories and most likely you won't gain weight...but you're ok..you're supposed to gain between 3-5 pounds in the first trimester anyways and since you're almost in your second then you're fine.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I'm 7 weeks and gained 3 lbs. My dr told me between normal weight fluctuation and being bloated, it probably isn't really a "gain" of 3 lbs and that I'd have a better idea after my body calmed down.<br>  <br>  I'd say just try to eat healthy, eat when you're hungry and stop when you're full, and switch over to things like whole grains, lots of veggies/fruits, etc. Those will keep you full longer than empty calorie snacks.|`|AI2VoFP4aa	if you eat healthy and exercise and still gain alot during pregnancy it could just be your body. my dr recommended lots of protein vegetables and water. no juice carbs or sugar and to limit the amount of fruit you eat. apparently babies gain weight quickly from the natural sugars in fruit which surprised me because i always thought of fruit as being a health food.|`|RSsQP24waa	work longer
DDIBEvUTaa	my son was the same way.  i just learned to accept & enjoy it.  i started getting him in the habit of napping by laying down to nurse at the same time & also wearing him in a sling at the store, even if i didn't need anything just so he'd sleep.  at 5 months he finally started taking naps.  stock up on 1 handed foods like boiled eggs & apples.  at 6 months he still likes to be held a lot.  but since he's learned to sit up he's content to play by himself long enough for me to do things around the house, eat & even get dressed!  sometimes they need to noy cry it out, but fuss it out.  there's sometimes when there's nothing i can do.  i just lay him down, he'll fuss for a minute, then pass out.  it will get better : )|`|wphLaVs6aa	My son was exactly like this for the first four to five months. He spent those months glued to me or my husband. It's exhausting and frustrating! But it's normal and this phase does pass. <br>  <br>  I used an ergo and it gave me some freedom to get things done. It's great because the baby is upright and the weight is all on your hips. I  still use it for my 11 month old son who is 21 lbs and it's comfortable.|`|68c6B8dRaa	The advice re. frozen meals and a baby carrier your back likes better is sound.|`|5wmrZEQ9aa	My baby went through that stage at around 3 months, too.  At 4 months, when she learned to sit up on her own, she was more interested in grabbing things around her and being enthralled with being able to sit up on her own.  At 3 months, I would put my baby in a bouncer that vibrated, or her vibrating papasan chair and just carry it around to whatever room I was in, and she'd calm down with the vibration.  I also played music.  Good luck...I remember that phase.  I was about to lose my mind at times.  I even carried her into the bathroom in the bouncer.|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	I would keep up the sling usage.  It may take just a little time for your back to adjust to the weight of the baby, but once it does, you'll LOVE using it!!  Try putting him in it for 20-30 minutes at a time, until your back gets adjusted to it.|`|JgZwvXXJaa	try a moby wrap I had back issues with the sling, I could wear the wrap all day and my back would not hurt|`|AA11065140	I had the same problem with my daughter.  I had the best results when I brought her infant car seat into the house for her to sleep in.  It was the small enough that with a couple of blankets to help wrap her up, she felt cuddled, and would sleep for a bit.  It also made it fairly easy for me to bring her with me from room to room, so that I could be there if she started fussing.<br>  <br>  I don't know that I'd agree with letting him cry it out, but to be sure, it won't hurt him to cry for a few minutes while you're peeing, or while you're making a sandwich for yourself.  In fact, it can help teach him a good lesson, which is that Mom will always come to his rescue, even if it takes a few minutes.|`|avx7bLnKaa	my son did this, yes they grow out of it... the key is to 1st after feeding baby, put baby down and fix your food, baby can cry for a few minutes, then you can pick baby up and eat while holding him<br>  <br>  2nd you need to get out of the house during the day, join a mom's group<br>  try <a href="http://meetup.com" rel="nofollow">http://meetup.com</a> and see if there are ny groups in your area<br>  <br>  i joined a mom's group when my first was  weeks old and although i still carried my son every where i just learned to balance him on my knee and eat lunch with the other moms and socialize, it saved my sanity<br>  <br>  but put baby down to fix yourself food,|`|hSJnaysiaa	I was recently dealing with this same issue except it wasn't my baby, it was the little girl I nanny during the day. I started with her when she was a newborn, and she is now (as of 2 days ago) 3 months old.<br>  <br>  Her parents co-sleep and wear her in a sling when they are home, but that's not an option for me. I am pregnant myself and once my baby comes he will be going to work with me so it was necessary for the girl I watch during the day to learn to be a bit more independent (because when the second baby comes I won't be able to hold her all day long, and she even wanted to be held while she slept!). So, I had to let her cry it out.<br>  <br>  Her parents aren't fond of the idea, but it didn't take long (just a couple days) and now she seems to be in a pretty good schedule (3 weeks later). She naps on her own, in her crib, from about 8:45-10:30am, then we go to her moms office so she can nurse. A short nap in the car on the way home from 12:00pm-12:15pm, then playtime at home. After playtime she is usually tired again by 1:30pm and sleeps until 3:30pm when her mom gets home. Its so much nicer now that she has her time to sleep. I wasn't able to pee, or eat, or take a break or anything when she wasn't and it was so tough.<br>  <br>  And I know her parents would have rather she not had to cry it out, heck, I didn't want to go through that either, but it really was needed. I'd rather her have a routine starting now, than wait until my baby comes and have all hell break loose when she's no longer the only baby in the house.<br>  <br>  Moby wraps do work, but I think using one will only delay the inevitable. Your baby needs to learn to sleep away from you, and the wrap will only make him more used to being close all the time and as he gets older (and heavier) this isn't a good thing.<br>  <br>  The baby I watch has also become more ok with being in her swing (she doesn't have a bouncy chair). She doesn't want to be in it for hours at a time, but she's ok for 15 minutes or so. Also, if I am upstairs away from her swing and need to pee I sit her in her baby bathtub and she kicks around while I pee. She seems to like that.<br>  <br>  Its going to be hard to hear him cry, but its best he learn now than later I think.|`|z6IekuwSaa	OK, when my daughter was 2 months she did this. Then I learned that when she was crying she was just telling me she's tired. I would lay her down in her crib and let her put herself to sleep. It was hard the first week. I only did this with bedtime first and then did it with naps. It saved my sanity. I can lay her down when she's grumpy. I play with her through out the day so she sits up at times. But a lot of the time I put a blanket down with toys on their and let her play. It was how she learned to role over. Just let him cry for a few minutes, then comfort him and try again. It's rough at first but it gets easier. Best of Luck|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You sound just like me when my son was that age. They do grow out of it I promise. Forget the sling, they work well for short term use or if you can hold them in it while napping. I lived on ready to eat foods like frozen burritos, frozen already cooked burgers, and cereal. I could eat it all with one hand and didn't need to really cook it, just toss it in the microwave. I used a moby wrap, much better on your back and the baby can stay upright.<br>  <br>  My son grew out of it around 3-4 months so you might be almost done. I can't say that he never wanted to be held but he was ok on his own for 15-20 min here and there.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i hated the slings<br>  buy a baby bjorn front pack WITH lumbar support; keep your posture in check and you will be fine<br>  i have damaged nerves to my back and with it adjusted right, i can carry her for hours as long as i watch my posture...<br>  and it is soo natural for him to want to be with you all the time; you are his security and without you he fees insecure and scared in this big new world around him....

7HzfgRmwaa	sorry i was away!! i was having a baby!!!!! :)<br>  <br>  i wonder what kind of ovulation kit you got?? Typically you ovulate in the middle of your cycle but since you are on those pills you could go anytime and multiple times!! Get a 30 day kit from walgreens or so and test now. :) You should get another period in 30 days remember - it may take more than one month but at least you know if you menstruate again in 30 days or so the pills are working. At least that's how i knew. <br>  <br>  Add details for more questions - ill check back :) Good Luck! Take the test in the morning everyday.

knyjNiy0aa	you cant be pregnant if you didnt have sex. n your boobs r probably sore on and off cause theyre growing since your still so young. you eating alot is probably all in your head. stop thinking about food.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	If you didn't have sex, then you can't be pregnant. Your 13 hun, your boobs are going to hurt. It is part of growing up. If you want to lose weight, try to eat healthier and exercise. You can speak to your Dr about healthy weight loss.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	If you have never been naked with a boy, you definitely are not pregnant.  Skip the rest of this paragraph.  If you have been getting naked with your boyfriend, it's possible you are pregnant, even if his penis never entered your vagina.  It's not very likely, but it does happen.  If even one drop of semen could have dripped into your vagina, all the little sperms in that drop of semen went egg-hunting and you need to take a test.<br>  <br>  Assuming that you are not pregnant, you are gaining weight because you are eating too much!  You need to drink more water, make sure that you're eating healthy stuff and not junk, and exercise regularly.  Cut out soft drinks and sweets.  Eat fruit rather than drinking fruit juices.  Read the labels on what you're eating.  Salads are good if you focus on the SALAD rather than oily, fatty dressings and other stuff people pile on.  <br>  <br>  You will probably find it very useful to keep a food diary for a few days.  Write down EVERYTHING you put in your mouth, including liquids, salad dressings, condiments, "just a bite" of whatever, for a few days.  A plain spiral notebook is fine.  Then talk it over with your mom or your doctor.<br>  <br>  DO NOT skip meals, take laxatives, make yourself throw up, or exercise for hours a day.  That stuff can kill you.  Don't fall for the garbage about sweating off "water weight" because you lose it by dehydrating yourself, which can make you sick.  And it all comes back when you give your body the water God designed it to have!  <br>  <br>  You likely haven't finished growing yet, which is to your advantage in the weight department.  If you can just maintain the weight you have now, chances are it will look lots better on you when you grow another couple of inches.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Hun if you didnt have sex then your not pregnant. Dont you think you could be gaining wieght because your eating alot? Just dont eat so much and eat healthier and excersise.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	you're ovulating..that happens two weeks after a period and i ALWAYS feel like this around ovulation..also the "fat" feeling will most likely last until after your period..once that's over you'll be fine and back to normal!|`|RjdrO7DVaa	honey you need to have sex to get pregnant...you're boobs are probably growing because your young ... your appetite increases when you hit puberty ... cut out soda and sweets ... that should shed a few pounds|`|6VrdiQw7aa	If you didn't have sex than you aren't pregnant. You might have a hyper thyroid which makes it harder to lose weight. Your boobs are sore maybe because you are going through puberty. Are you eating healthy and exercising?

You can also ask your parents to take you to the doctor to get a blood test done if you really want to know the result.|`|tJbMZ0mkaa	if you didn't have sex then your not prego. it could be the side affects to the birth control you could be taking..or the changes your body is still going through.|`|0UPvxzkxaa	if you haven't had sex your not pregnant!!! <br>  sorry don't know any advice bout weight issues.|`|jSn8Vd1taa	If you didn't have sex, you're not pregnant...that's kind of a given.|`|tMkt8IgIaa	sure your name is not mary

277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	i would say pump more often but you're already doing that.  i know when i eat fish, just normal cod, the next day i notice a difference, i don't pump anymore, but they are noticeably bigger.  alfalfa is supposed to be a good one as well.  you could try taking fish oil pills, sounds discusting, ik.  but it could help.  try this web site.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksupply/herbal_galactagogue.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/milksuppl...</a><br>  <br>  oh! another thing you could try as far as latching.  what worked for me was to get him in the right position and squirt a little milk in his mouth.  he wouldn't latch properly.  but if i did that then he opened his little mouth up and went after it.|`|OLW0Irbhaa	The good news is that I was reading that the amount they eat doesn't change significantly in the first 6 months.<br>  <br>  My son was a preemie and was using bottles and breastmilk in the hospital for 6 weeks.  After he came home we started the work of transitioning him to the breast.  It took 6 weeks but we got it and he breastfed till he was 16 months old!  I started by feeding him like I would if he were breastfeeding-I took off my shirt, held him close, when I stopped to burp him I'd change him to the other side.  I changed his bottles to the Playtex nurser with the latex nipple and then to the breast.  <br>  <br>  You also may need to try some different techniques while you pump to help with your let-down.  I had to relax, have a pic of the baby nearby, and as funny as it sounds I used visualization of milk being released and my body responded with more and faster let-downs!  And it's true your body will respond better to the baby at the breast than the pump but I have known women who pumped exclusively until a year old (!) so it can be done but you'll have to work on your pumping techniques.  Also, make sure if you go this route that you have a good pump, maybe even consider renting a hospital grade pump and see if that makes a difference.<br>  <br>  Have you met with anyone from LaLeche or the lactation consultant at the hospital where you delivered?  They may be able to help you as well because they can see what he's doing when you try to get him to latch on.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations on doing a wonderful job for your little one!|`|CzKrqgmgaa	keep trying to get him to latch. babies are the most efficient pumps there are. if you can get him to get on even a minute at a time it will help. dont give up. get him to latch for a minute or two every feeding before his bottle.|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Pump for 15 minutes every two hours during the day at AT LEAST every 4 hours at night.|`|JWwrXBpAaa	Get the book The Baby Whisperer-- all your answers are in there...too much to type!! Good luck!|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Have you seen a Lactation Consultant?  She could help you with the latching issue, and it would be well worth the money.  <br>  <br>  I admire your resolve.  I think exclusively pumping is way harder than exclusively breastfeeding.  But I will be honest: I have never known anyone to do it more than 2 months, because it is so hard. It is really really hard to keep up with his demand that way.  Good Luck!

I don't think that you need to change it unless you really think it's messing with your self confidence.  Chad is a fairly strong name.  I have a great friend name Brad -- everyone calls him Bradley although that's NOT his name.  He just doesn't answer when people call him something other than his name -- or he makes a joke, "There's a lot of things people call me, but Chadwick isn't one of them."|`|HQf3QPUMaa	Well, kind of.  It depends how old you are.  I think it's pretty normal for people in their late 20's.  But don't worry; just like bell-bottoms it will come back around again (think of names like Eva, Sophie, and Lily)|`|gmaCvh00aa	NO, Chad is one of those classic names that never really gets old.  It's not overused, either.  Stick with it, you might get to like it.  There are enough Michaels and Tylers and Christophers and Seans running around--be different!|`|DP48dIxhaa	I have never heard of the name Chadwickk and wouldn't call u Chadwickk if I met u...that is weird.

If you really want to solve the problem just ask him. It's always better that way because going behind his back to chande his actions isn't really nice. Maybe, you could put him in a situation that has to make him stand up for himself and then out of nowhere ask him "Why don't you do that more often?" and he'll be like "Do what?" and you'll say "Stand up for yourself."

8Rn2pX4jaa	LOL... you sound like you are in the same boat I am in.  (Looking for anyway to speed up the process!)  I have heard that it really doesn't work.  It causes you to clear out your bowels, which some think will your uterus to contract.  But most docs say it is not an effective way to induce labor.  I have been spending 40 minutes on the treadmill every night trying to get something moving.  (So far it doesn't seem to be doing to much.)<br>  <br>  I saw this site earlier today and thought it was interesting in debunking some common myths.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.parentingweekly.com/pregnancy/pregnancy_information/induction.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.parentingweekly.com/pregnancy...</a><br>  <br>  Tonight I plan on seducing my husband.  I am desperate!  ;-)  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.  Make sure to report back if something works for you!|`|5f6XnInEaa	I think that anyone who is fully aware of the risks it poses, yet takes it anyway, should not be having children.<br>  <br>  Castor oil is treated like a POISON, and I have no idea why people would want to poison a child out of the uterus, when the baby is obviously comfortable, and not ready to be born yet.<br>  <br>  Shame on anyone who can't wait a few measly weeks, for a baby to be healthy and born on their own accord.<br>  <br>  This of course is all considering that the baby. mother and pregnancy are all healthy, and since if there was a medical reason for induction, a doctor would be doing it.<br>  <br>  No mother without a medical reason has EVER died from being so patient, but babies before BEFORE they were ready to be have unfortunately died.<br>  <br>  Judging by your last questions, you are anywhere between 35 weeks, and 37 weeks.<br>  I find it despicable that someone would even think about trying to induce right now.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/reasons-to-induce-labor.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.givingbirthnaturally.com/reas...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.birthingnaturally.net/birthplan/options/start.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.birthingnaturally.net/birthpl...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_oil" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castor_oil</a>|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I would stay away from castor oil. Every woman that I have ever talked to or read about says not only does it not work, but only gives you a horrible case of cramps and diarrhea. If you do happen to cramp yourself into labor, think of the mess you might have on the delivery table. 90% of women poop while pushing anyway, think of what would happen if you had diarrhea. Plus the fact that diarrhea can dehydrate you and make you weak. It is also controversial bc some experts think that it can cause the baby to have a bowel movement in the uterus and that can be dangerous. Try sex and nipple stimulation. These are proven methods of natural induction. Sex works bc semen softens the cervix and helps it dilate. Female orgasm causes the body to produce Oxytocin which causes contractions. Nipple stimulation also causes the body to produce Oxytocin. Some women compare these contractions to the contractions felt when induced artificially at the hospital with Pitocin. Stimulate the nipples for 5 minutes every 15 minutes for 4 hours. These things combined worked for my husband and I twice so we swear by it. But your baby will not come until it is ready.<br>  <br>  If you are not at least 39 weeks pregnant, don't try inducing yourself. When the baby's lungs are developed it secretes a hormone that tells the mother's body to produce Ocytocin to start labor. Inducing before that happens, you are taking the chance of your baby's lungs not being developed enough for birth yet. Baby know when it needs to come out. If it isn't medically necessary, I would avoid induction before 39 weeks.|`|tcHkn0VIaa	It can make u very uncomfortable with hours on the toilet and still produce no results, I think you are doing about all that you could or should do. good luck|`|TBaf74bfaa	Castoroil makes your hair thats all I've heard

IPl3Yh1kaa	Yes you can. I am not sure what kind of insurance you have, however with my insurance I was responsible for covering the cost that was above and beyond what a vaginal birth with epidural would have been. It sounds confusing, but basically I paid out of pocket the difference. I got a private room so my husband could stay with me the 3 days I was there, so my insurance deducted the cost of the room stay and applied that to the total bill. I think in the end it was about $1,800 out of pocket not counting the expense of the room. My birth was really beautiful and smooth. The best day of my life :-) <br>  <br>  I found a doctor whose birth philosophy was the same as mine. Waterbith, hypnobirth, homebirth, vaginal with epidural, vaginal without epidural, c-section etc are all viable birth options and one is not 'superior' to another. <br>  <br>  Good luck in whatever you choose.<br>  <br>  EDIT: btw, I hear all these horror stories about c's, but I have to tell you my birth was BEAUTIFUL. it took an hour, I was not in nearly as much pain as everyone says and I went home with no narcotics. I took Ibuprofen when needed when I got home. I could walk, I got out of the bed and walked the next day and wanted to walk same day. I went out to lunch with my hubby when we left the hospital. Sore? Yes, excrutiating pain? No. I was honestly out and about moving around from the minute I left the hospital. My scar is barely visable. If you have any questions email me.|`|cfdooGylaa	I dont know how much but you can definitely arrange for one with your doctor. Its called an elective c-section, talk to your doctor about it. But vaginal is way safer for you and your baby...|`|5N3odm3Qaa	Yes, you can absolutely arrange for a Cesarean section birth. Many doctors prefer (yes, folks, PREFER) to perform C-sections because of scheduling. It is much easier to set that up and knock out a birth in an hour, rather than spend 20 hours checking in on a woman whose uterus is calling the shots.<br>  <br>  Your insurance may or may not cover the procedure. Generally it will cost about $8,000 to $15,000 for a normal C-section (meaning no NICU or emergency/extra care is required) but you may wind up paying only a few thousand of that, depending on how comprehensive your insurance plan is.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Why not use the NHS? It would be foolish to throw away absolutely no less than ￡5000 (typically upwards of ￡10,000 to ￡12,000) for a private hospital to perform the operation.|`|MFsuN8Doaa	Yes, in the UK you can elect to have an c-section on the NHS, but I don't think they like doing it. If you choose to have one, you will be reviewed by two Doctor's and a Psychiatric(sp) to ensure that you are in the correct frame of mind, as it is classed as major surgery and I know that my NHS trust doesn't like putting people though it if they don't have to. <br>  <br>  I am assuming that you are not pregnant at the moment, so I would just pop to your GP and check out the facts with him/her, or maybe even contact your local community Midwife office, and they should be able to tell you how they go about it.|`|Foi6PFWQaa	You can have a scheduled C-section. But I don't know if you ave to pay for it.|`|MXXOICquaa	not all doctors will do it but most will and your insurance should cover it|`|yQiUzB0faa	I to wanted a C-section. But my doctor told me I would be fine having a vaginal birth. It wasn't until I went to get induced that I found out I couldn't have an epidural because of a large tattoo on my back. I refused to be induced because I have terrible asthma that is triggered by pain. So my gyno sceduled a c-section. It is very painful. But the pain only last a few weeks. My Aunt had vaginal births and her last was a c-section for medical reasons. She said the c-section was worse than the vaginal birth.  When I was in the hospital the pain was terrible with my first c-section my second one was not that bad.  If I were able to have had a epidural I would have had a vaginal birth. My insurance covered the c-section. Because my doctor just put down large baby for reason as having c-section. Good luck.|`|wLhcRPUOaa	Doctors dont like to do a Cesarean unless medically nessasary. It is a major surgery and can have complications. Of course you will have to pay for it. It is a huge surgery to have. You cant laugh or cough without holding a pillow to your tummy. For a couple weeks you can not lift anything heavier than your baby. Why would you want this?|`|r4E2zXL8aa	I had a cesarean with my first child. 3 years later i was pregnant again and decided i wanted another.I did not choose a cesarean the first time, but i did the second time. they said okay, and my insurance did cover it.
WPI0Z47saa	Is there even anything wrong with this baby? Just because the other pregnancies were unsucessiful doesn't mean that this one will be. I would definitely at least wait to see if there was something majorly wrong with this baby or not before even considering it.|`|PpYBnxgpaa	NO NO NO NO NO <br>  <br>  I was told I could never have children by 3 doctors due to severe trauma during a pregnancy when I was young causing me to loose my child . Now I have a one almost two year old and pregnant with my third child and would never think of aborting it|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Why would anyone abort a baby because of prefvious tragedies? That makes as much sense as saying everytime you get ina  green car, you end up in a car wreck- so you're going to go home and sell your green car.|`|FYDw1rjlaa	No, I would take the chance and would never abort my baby. Every baby is different.|`|WhRITqFyaa	It depends on: if this woman was in a healthy relationship; if her health would not be hindered by the delivery; And lastly if she and her partner could afford to raise the baby. Just because Beethoven was born under those exact conditions has nothing to do with the times... Beethoven's mother would have had to face a 95% chance of death trying to abort the baby back then... That is not the case with this century. If all the above if's are cool, then I say it's worth the shot!<br>  <br>  If not its just Drama Dangerous and Damn right Degenerous!<br>  1) A healthy relationship with BOTH partners involved gives a child a good chance on success in everything..<br>  2) The woman's personal health should be put above the need to want to have a child, and this includes the pregnant mom too.<br>  3) The opportunities of the child being born should not be limited by possibly the mother's selfish needs (if the male partner is unwilling to go along) or it impairs the long-term psychological development of the child.<br>  <br>  Having said that even a sick-mad-woman can have a child, anyone woman can... that does not mean every woman should... There are a lot of poor, hopeless kids filled with miserable lives cursing the day they were helplessly forced into this world, that need help...! If any woman really really wants a kid so bad and does not meet the requirements above she ought to consider adopting one of those kids... She just might find love in the process!|`|crVFU6lBaa	Well, no I wouldn't - of course. I am fully and wholely pro-choice.. but there was nothing wrong with that baby, and no hint of the mother not wanting the child. <br>  <br>  If I wanted a child, and there was nothing shown to be wrong with my pregnancy - why the heck wouldn't I take the chance? Why the heck would I abort the fetus just because things went wrong before?|`|Q1MPlkhjaa	Unless I was made aware that the baby would be born with an unsurvivable condition, I wouldn't abort pregnancy just on the premise that I had previously miscarried and/or one of the pregnancies resulted in a brain dead child.|`|AA10186411	Hell no, I would NEVER abort a child.|`|AA11595906	Probably not.  If I became pregnant again, I would wait and see what happens.
MzHwklzKaa	It's very possible that your boyfriend's family could foster you.<br>  <br>  Beware!<br>  Calling child welfare opens a can of worms that you might not want anything to do with.  We got custody of one of my friends when we were 16.  Her mother's new boyfriend got a little too "hands on", if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  Here's some advise from someone who's "been there, done that".<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend's parents should become foster parents BEFORE you call CPS.  If not, you'll go to a group home while the paper work is being completed.<br>  BAD NEWS!!!<br>  You think your home life is bad?  Try living with juvenile delinquents with 1 foot in jail.  You will be afraid to sleep!  My friend said when they weren't threatening her life, they were stealing her stuff and telling lies about her to get her in trouble.<br>  <br>  There will be an investigation.  Don't lie.<br>  I'll say that again in case you missed it.<br>  DON'T LIE!!!<br>  Offer proof of abuse, but they'll know if you're lying, and you will be in big, big trouble.<br>  <br>  The social worker said that once they place a 16 year old, generally, they don't do anything else with the case.  <br>  Why?<br>  You'll age out of the system before your case gets to court.  That's right, there's a 2-3 year back log in family court, and cases involving teens get shoved to the back burner.  Sure enough, we didn't get 1 single court paper until a few weeks after my friends 18th birthday.  They just wanted to let her know her case had been dropped and there was nothing else they could, or would do for her.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	ummm, unfit how?  Like do you have broken bones, bruises and do your parents smoke crack in front of you?  Do they beat each other up in front of you? Or is someone sexually abusing your body? Are there 52 cats in your home and litter box mess in the carpet?<br>  <br>  Thats usually the kind of thing it takes for parents to be proven unfit. <br>  <br>  Once you were in Foster Care you could end up anyplace in the state with Foster Parents who won't even allow you to see your old boyfriend. And the first thing they will do is look for an Aunt, Uncle, Grandma or second cousin who would be interested in taking care of you. <br>  <br>  Your boyfriends parents would have to take training and have background checks, and prove they are fit--then every month a caseworker would come to their home to Check on things...  Like if you were kissing your foster brother or not....<br>  <br>  Define Horrible and if it is Horrible then report it to someone you trust and call CPS to let them know yourself.<br>  <br>  If your parents ARE found to be Fit then depending on your age you could be in trouble for a false allegation of abuse or neglect and depending on your state your foster home could end up being residential treatment. <br>  <br>  They do not usually allow the foster children to Pick who they will live with. If it is this bad maybe your parents would be happy to be rid of you and have no problem paying your boy friends parents child support and then every one's problems would be solved. <br>  <br>  Horrible is one thing--but, Unfit is another especially when it comes to Teenagers and Judges who are really the ones who would make a decision like this...<br>  <br>  maybe you should look into Emancipation.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You can call social services and they'll send someone over to check out your family and home life.<br>  <br>  If it's deemed unacceptable they'll take you away.  You'll go into foster care until parental rights are terminated. That can take up to 15 months!  They will then find a family that is suited to raising someone your age, with your background.  They will most likely be in the state but not necessarily the same county/parish.  <br>  I doubt your bf's parents could adopt you. They'd have to be certified to foster/adopt first and that can take at least 6 months.  IF they agreed to do that they'd need to start the process as soon as you were taken into foster care.<br>  <br>  I doubt the system would allow it since he's your bf and you would be his "sister" if they adopted you. That's not something that's looked upon as a good thing.|`|AA12174100	if they new that it was your boyfriends family, then no. As then it would be incest as your boyfrind would legally be your brother|`|Jime0cdqaa	Omigosh, please, please think about this. Every teenager gets tired of being at their home. My friends daughter called dcf on her mom and got put into foster care because they didn't get along. Now she regrets it and her life has spiraled downhill. <br>  <br>  You might be able to go there but why do you think they would want to? Adopting a child is a huge step and they couldn't do it for a year anyway and thats only if both of your bio parents lost or gave up their rights. You might also get shipped to a house in the styx on the outskirts of the county, and have to switch schools and never be able to see your boyfriend. <br>  <br>  Be careful what you do in this situation. Some of lifes decisions change us forever. If you are in a dangerous situation talk to an adult you trust first. If nothing is getting done, call dcf or the police so they can start an investigation. If you are not in a bad situation......don't do anything!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	If your boyfriends family could take you into foster care if they asked....But you will probably go to a fmaily member first and if no family members could take u and they didnt let ur bfs family they would try to keep u in the area but u would be put in any home they can find....Personally i wouldnt want to be put in a foster home its not all that great...your home life cant be that horrible can it?|`|inA6ZLeAaa	No, you would not be able to live with your boyfriend, They would put you in the system and you would be moved away from, the area you are in to keep you safe. Is you house unsafe now? If so, you need to take action, or were you hoping to move in with your boyfriend?|`|5824744e4ab4fcfafc968e00935b02e5aa	well first dhr would come to your home and then you would be put in the foster care system . if his parents are not foster parents then they would have to be approved and take classes .  you would more than likeyl be puti n a group home until they could place you .|`|2wyDALHgaa	They would place you were ever they have a spot, if they have spots.  In my area we have about 120 children living, supervised, in local hotels.  They would then take time to work with your parents to rectify any situation there may be that you reported on and then IF it could be fixed you would be back home again.  If it couldn't be rectified then in time you would be cleared for adoption and the only way your BFs family could adopt you is if they qualified.  Given your relationship with their son however I'm pretty sure they would not qualify.

NkjAqQWBaa	I would def let your doc know, but I know several women that had there period at the start of their pregnancy. If she was going to loose the baby usually there is a lot of cramping, and more blood...clots like. Google it, and make sure you call your doc tomorrow. Better safe than sorry. :) good luck sweetie.|`|ied3Ww49aa	I am in no position to say it's NOTHING to worry about but she is very early in her pregnancy so it is possible it's just her blood from implantation or her menstrual cycle.

I spoke to my nurse about it and she said it was nothing to worry about so long as it isn't bright red, it doesn't contain any blood clots, and there isn't any stomach cramps or lower back pain. When you're pregnant you can never be too cautious so if this doesn't feel right to you go see your doctor.|`|0aad97d9db05440fa56bc3fe102003b2aa	Some spotting during pregnancy is normal. If she begins to bleed a lot or if the blood is bright red, then there is cause for concern. I know a woman who bled for her first 5 months of pregnancy and her baby was fine. It is not supposed to happen, but a small amount can be alright as long as there is no other symptoms. A miscarriage would be if she had heavy bleeding and it was clumpy. Sounds like it was just some spotting. She will need to tell her Dr. but it doesn't sound too bad to be worried over.|`|zEXzwJ0Naa	did she have sex? if she did, it could be because of sex. nothing to worry about. she is ok. if she does not have anything when wipe, then she's fine but if she still have it until the next day to the next day, she should go see a doctor and do a check up. it could lead to miscarriage but of course i'm just guessing. i hope she is fine.|`|u3sxwcPoaa	Spotting is normal.<br>  Bright red blood is not good, though.

yZDyUfSNaa	I have endo and it took me two years to get pregnant with my first. We tried on our own for a year, then a year on clomid, IUIs, tests up the whazoo etc., and finally an exploratory laparoscopy that found Stage II-III endo and a dermoid cyst that had ruined my right ovary. Wonder of wonders though, I got pregnant on the first try after the lap, naturally, when we thought the next step was injectables or IVF. I also got pregnant with my second child on the first try, now that surprised the heck out of me! :) <br>  <br>  Tips...don't wait the entire year of trying most people have to before seeing a specialist. Try for six months on your own. If it doesn't happen, you have a condition known to affect fertility (I believe the stats were that 40% of women suffering from fertility issues have endo) and the doctors/reproductive endocrinologists (RE) should be more apt to work with you early. Heck, you might even just want to talk to your OB before you start trying as they may be willing to refer you to a RE, or give you an ultrasound, or an HSG, etc., to check things out beforehand. Why waste a year trying if your tubes are closed from scarring or glued to your uterus, ya know? (I never did have any patience, especially when I was ready to start a family. lol)<br>  <br>  You might want to look into the endo diet. Just google it and you'll find a bunch of info. I think there's even a book or two on it. I never did it, seeing as I had no idea I had endo while we were trying, but some women swear by it.<br>  <br>  I recall reading somewhere that clomid actually makes it harder to get pregnant with endo, or makes the endo worse. Not sure how true it is, but worth mentioning as a lot of OBs blindly prescribe it to people these days without any follow-up ultrasounds to check for hyperstimulation etc. I am a firm believer in knowing as much as you can about your health issues and being an advocate of it as I've actually witnessed my doctors telling me complete untruths, not on purpose but because they really didn't know. Seriously, still boggles my mind, but what can you do other than educate yourself.<br>  <br>  And, most importantly, know that endo is not a death sentence to having a family. It may take you a little longer than some but it is still very possible. I have two healthy and beautiful children to prove it. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck and baby dust...|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	My mom had severe endometriosis (she was 32) and got pregnant after three months.|`|CkkPaP8vaa	If you are a person that menstruates 2x/month you will have a hard time not only finding the time to try but predict your ovulation cycle without a kit.   Honestly I would try the old fashion way for a few months before you try to get all scientific about it but then get a ovulation kit.   Also another watch out is your odds of having twins are higher due to ovulating 2x/month.
1elv7oc5aa	Hell no.  They only act like they like her because they want to be able to go see their dad more often with her.  How could they possibly know if they like her or not when they just met her?  You are their mother and you know what is best for them.  Sure you want them to be able to see their dad but they will have to do it on your time.  Dad made his mistake not you.  And if it ever becomes a problem with your boys you just let them know that.  Tell them that you want them to be able to see their dad as much as possible but them going with some strange person is out of the question.  Good luck.|`|c5068603ce14825332c2f7bfb7b4b118aa	I wouldn't let them go. I would explain in a nice manner that you do not feel comfortable with the situation and You will get them there when you have the time to. You are their mother and if you feel uncomfortable then stick with your gut instinct with it. The boys may be upset about it but they will get over it.|`|wqqY6rjFaa	abosolutely not even if the kids want to go i wouldnt trust your kids with her i mean regardless even if shes a good person you never know someones true intentions not saying shed do something bad but theri your childrren i dont think you should let them go with someone they dont know and that you hate|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	gosh that is hard i would say no bc i know what my reaction of a girl i didnt like wanted to take my kids to see my ex... i would kind of be mad but 2 they are his kids so i think i would get a baby sitter & take them myself|`|jLYTKr33aa	Would I let an enemy take my children to prison?  HELL NO!  If the boys want to see their father, take them yourself.  Letting someone who hates you take them to prison, of all places, sounds neither emotionally nor physically safe.  Don't do it.|`|ki3XY49daa	There is no way I could do it.  The one rule I stick by as a mother is that if I have ANY doubts about something, then I don't let it happen.  You shouldn't feel guilt about it either.  Those are YOUR boys!|`|DhmUgq0maa	Personally i wouldn't do it for many reasons: I wouldn't want my children to know what the inside of a prison looked like and I don't trust anyone but family to take care of my children let alone some chic that is silly enough to start a relationship with a man who is in jail.<br>  <br>  Your choice hun, if you feel comfortable with it then yes, if you don't then no..|`|f6aqMg97aa	It is good that you take the boys to see there father.  I would not let this other woman take them.  You don't know what she is telling them.  In a prison atmosphere you want to be with your children.  Perhaps you could have a sitter watch the baby and you can take the boys.  Perhaps once a month.. Talk to your boys find out what the y want to do.  You could make vidoes or tape recordings of the boys and send them to daddy.  <br>  <br>  Personally No I would not trust the other woman.  But as you stated you have the final decision.  If you did allow here to take them it would help you out but, are you POSITIVE they would be safe??!!!  Have you done a background check on this woman... You never know, and I don't want to see another news report some woman kidnapped child, husband escaped from Prison and then they end up in another country......  This is something you have to truely consider.<br>  <br>  You are doing the right thing about looking at both sides of the box.|`|sAd3RDnSaa	No|`|itj9UuaPaa	as a mom, i say you let them with her to visit their father. This gives them a chance to visit him and lets you have more time with your new baby as well as giving you a bit of a break. it seems reasonable if the boys want to see their father to take them, and even more reasonable that if you cannot take them to let them go with someone who can and is willing to take them.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	Go with your mothers instinct.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	No, I would not let another woman take MY children anywhere. In your case, YOUR boys with YOUR ex is solely YOUR business. Besides that, it's disrespectful if you're still together and gives the wrong message.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Absolutely not.  You don't know her any more and she can have problems that you don't know about.  Keep your kids safe and take them when you get a chance.|`|oem5yEUDaa	You don't know her or have any idea what she is like. She could run off with them for all you know. There is no way in hell I would allow this.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Hell no, I wouldn't let them go with her..especially if you hated eachother for so long.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	no way

People HATE when u ignore them. Act like it doesn't even bother u. They're clearly jealous of you or something and have nothing better to do.

(pretend to not hear them) Oh sorry What were you saying?<br>  if they say it again they are not worth anyones time..|`|KZN5wzyRaa	i'm a teen mum too and ya it can be hard but what kind of example are you giving to you baby in getting into this sort of thing, just forget them there will always be petty poeple in the world, never mind them and mind your clild!|`|FG5xXm2maa	yeah i agree with the comment above. Those girls are inmature bitches who need to grow up. <br>  <br>  Be the better person, and just simply tell them to shut up.|`|X2ADohmtaa	say "stop talking about your baby that way!"<br>  <br>  or say.....<br>  <br>  "oh are you talking about my baby or your baby???"|`|yKS2UI87aa	Tell them to grown up All of God's children are beautiful!! I am glad you are fininshing school.|`|QGdXMwXVaa	Well if i were in my case i would ignore them, it seems that they are being jerks and they just want to insult you to make themselves feel better but if you want a comebacks i got some:]<br>  "It sounds like English, but I can't understand a word you're saying."<br>  "And which dwarf is your son/girl?, yep i went there"<br>  "I'd insult you, but you're not bright enough to notice."<br>  Just google "Comebacks" :] u will get lots of awesome comebacks in few seconds
Tsq5rQZGaa	that is not fair at all!! it does not matter who you are or what curriculum you are in. YOU have INCREDIBLE VALUE no matter where you are, who you are, who your friends are, or what you do and they need to treat you as such!! do not take that from them. tell someone you trust what you go through, how you feel, and ask them to do something about it if you do not want to confront them yourself.<br>  <br>  you are an EXTREMELY VALUABLE person for being YOU -- do NOT forget that!! and don't let their words get to your head...they just don't know how incredibly wonderful you really are. :)|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My thought is that it is NEVER ok. You need to tell your teacher and name names. Tell them who is bullying you because their parents need to be told so that they can fix the problem before it gets worse. Good luck hon!|`|yKS2UI87aa	No not fair at all. Report all losers who bully you to a teacher.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	no it isn't. Talk to your parents and teachers. Don't let those losers get to you... you are much better than them.|`|ZYi2ZlUnaa	No, this isn't fair at all. Tell a parent or trusted adult about this. If you're too embarrassed to do this, ignore the bullying. They only bully you because they feel inferior and putting other people down makes them feel more important. In other words, just act as if you never heard them when they start to bully you. Don't cry either. It helps me if I listen to music. It varies for different people.|`|EMgDhRnjaa	Absolutely not. Bullying is never right. It is always wrong to pick on someone for whatever reason.|`|clDdlcZyaa	Bullying is never okay. Ever. That's my thought on that. :)|`|G9ywiLqvaa	bullying is never ok whether you're in special ed or not!<br>  report these creepos!<br>  and never, ever think low of yourself for getting teased because of your disabilities.  everyone's got a fair fight out there.|`|AA10943329	bullying is never right.

7PXFXcKfaa	lol completely normal - think of what your poor lower half has been through! Quick labours do make the bruised feeling worse - in effect your body has had no time to warm up! <br>  <br>  It will go away really soon - doctors recommend 6 weeks to recover and heal, but i personally felt normal after about 3!<br>  <br>  Big congrats on your new bundle - i hope your not too sleep deprived!|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I also had a quick birth but was tender for about two weeks.  I think it is totally normal.  Think about how much trauma your "parts" went thru.  My doctor told me to take regular ibuprophen and it helped alot.|`|49b98532f1c2a607d94d38f43a315f96aa	Yes, it's normal.  I also though I didn't tear ended up having a hemorroid from pushing so it added on to the bruised feeling.  It's very normal though.  Congrats on your baby.|`|avx7bLnKaa	yes|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Totally normal.  I was very bruised and I only pushed a few times and had minor tears.  Nothing really bad.  I bruised and was in pretty bad pain for weeks.  I overdid it after my son was born and I paid the price.  This set my recovery back big timee.<br>  <br>  I even had a hard time sitting on the toilet for about 6 weeks...it felt like an enormous amount of pressure.  I asked the dr at my check up and he said it would go away.  It did!!  <br>  <br>  Just try some ice in a sock or something.  And try to stay off of your feet.  If you do this the bruising will get better really quick!|`|AA11430796	i had a 9 1/2lb baby 6 months ago and still feel bruised. Seriously. still hurts my tail bone when i sit. so yes. its possible.|`|u2ZCBT7Yaa	Aww congrats! And yes it could be that. It happens|`|6AvVVzsnaa	I was like that when my daughter was born. I felt like somebody beat me with a bat after my baby was born and wanted to sleep for like 2 days. They had to sew me down there alot because my baby's head was kinda big when I pushed her out.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	... wow after a 25 hour labour with my son and over an hour of pushing that is just amazing!!! <br>  but i think its pretty normal to feel bruised. thats a big ordeal even if it didnt last all that long for you...<br>  congrats and rest up while you can :)<br>  <br>  my remedies were ibuprofein or tylenol and a stack of epsom salts in the bath and a good long hot soak.

You don't just "get over it." <br>  But if this is some kind of joke, then I hope you realize what you're doing. People who have been raped suffer from all sorts of mental conditions following that actual rape, and they have to live with that for the rest of their lives. Maybe someone with a soul could help you. <br>  And if you were really raped, I apologize. So many people get on here to have a pity party.

87WOSjwgaa	I really like Ian James Blake Culp. It honors important men in your life but also gives your son his own identity!|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I like blake Thomas best. I think your mom really wants you to be happy and is making a suggestion.|`|Elxuvon8aa	your mom will not always be here so use what you want your child to go|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I really like James for a first name, a lot of people overuse it for a middle. <br>  <br>  James Michael Blake Culp flows nicer, in my opinion, so I would go with that one. It still honors your husband, but it gives him his own identity too.|`|DP48dIxhaa	Listen 2 mom. Name him James Blake Thomas! I think that is rly cute.|`|m16dhfrGaa	Stuff 'em.  Sorry, but you're going through the pregnancy ... You're getting big, feeling uncomfortable, had the sickness ... yada yada yada ... and I won't mention what's to come.  So, what do YOU want to call your son?  After all, you're the one who will be calling him the most.  And when he's sitting in his chair, do you want to say, "Jimmy, don't throw your food on the floor!"  or, "Blake, quit that!"   What do you want to call him??  They can call him what they like.  If you decide on the two names they want in the middle, then I would go for blake james, rather than james blake.   Thomas James is kinda nice.  Tommy J, TJ, Tom Jim.  I can see a Thomas James Culp.  But it's your choice.  You're the Mom!|`|1khNE20iaa	Hmm, that's tough.<br>  If I were you I'd listen to my mother.<br>  I mean, James is a great name for a boy!<br>  And especially since she's sick, I think it would make here feel happy :)<br>  Good luck!|`|TGUoZF63aa	tough situation!<br>  <br>  How about making his first name James to make your mother happy, but calling him by his middle name, whether it be Ian, Blake or Thomas. That way, everyone gets what they want.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	Go with Ian James Black Culp
OI3bf4yjaa	Who cares if he masturbates? EVERYONE masturbates, come on.|`|uCnmYEPBaa	It's a part of growing up. And at 16, you should be knocking before entering his room.<br>  Talk to your husband, or his father, have him talk with your son and explain that as natural as it is, he needs to learn to be quiet about it.|`|n4d7rqr4aa	WHOA.  You should be talking to him, having a conversation with him, not asking how to keep him from masturbating on Yahoo!Answers.  There's obviously something much deeper going on.|`|tfYy5k64aa	What do you mean by alot? I mean masterbating is normal for a boy of that age...

sOO93u5Oaa	First of all, if you have unprotected sex for a year and nothing happens, it doesn't mean you're safe, it means you got lucky. Pregnancy can result at any time, and if you are going to be having unprotected sex, you need to be aware of that. If you go 2 weeks without taking a pill, there is a good chance you could be pregnant. The pill only works to prevent pregnancy if you take it at the same time every single day. You seem to be having symptoms of pregnancy, so I think it is possible that you could be pregnant. Just because you are having your 'period' does not mean that you can't take a test now. The sooner you know, the better.|`|sP3UtfJ1aa	if i was u i would get a pregnancy test, when your pregnant your body produces a different hormone that is present and usually isn't there but a good pregnancy test should be able to detect it<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|QJ7ogJloaa	ummm... i cant tell you if your pregnant or not, go take a test or go to the doctor.|`|LyZkgPILaa	well how long have you been off of the pill <br>  being on it for 3 years and then not taking it for 2 weeks can cause uncomfortable feelings cuz your body is not used to it. <br>  wait until ur period is over and then take a test if you dont want to take the test make an appiontment with your doctor. i hope i helped.|`|yyyx6ugAaa	it sounds like you are pregnant but take a test to be sure and then weigh your options.|`|rMb4vyOuaa	you could go to your doctor and get blood drawn and you could be tested.
4KXA5oVtaa	Babies start going through their first growth spurt between 3 and 4 weeks.  Which generally can cause your baby to be uncomfortable.  Colic generally also starts at 3-4 weeks of life....just try to cuddle her as much as possible, make sure she's not too hot or too cold and it should pass soon.  Growth spurts usually last only 2-4 days and colic until about 12 weeks.  Good luck!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Swaddle her up nice and tight, grab a pacifier if you use them, take her into the bathroom and turn on the shower(don't get in and keep the lights dim), gently bounce with her and give her the pacifier if she will take it. I was never any good at it but you can also hold her like a football on her side facing away from you, my husband could do it. It's called the 5Ss, swaddle, shoosh(white noise), suck, swing, side.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkR_e1L6zxI&feature=PlayList&p=ABF6CFB2AE0E45E4&index=5" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkR_e1L6z...</a>|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	hold her, rock her, cuddle her, take her for a walk in the stroller or a sling. go for a car ride|`|l6nAcep5aa	she may have bad wind when my lil boy wont stop crying i lay him on my tummy and pat his back it usually comforts him and he goes to sleep he is also 4 weeks old<br>  another reason is it may be too hot my son starts screaming when its too hot i put him in front of the air-con and feed him and hes fine<br>  hope i help|`|3EhoJ42zaa	She could have a gas bubble or an upset tummy.  Put a pillow inthe dryer for a few minutes, then take it out place it on your lap and then lay baby belly down on the pillow.  See if that helps.  You may want to try gripe water also.  You can get it in any baby isle at any store.
6qCnpxrNaa	I will give you free advice (this is actually what I do).  I'm going to be honest with you...more honest than you're being with yourself at the moment.  You CAN do this!  But, you can't do it without making some changes to your life which involve imposing change on the lives of your husband and your children.  Your daughter is going to have to learn to handle this and pitch in as well as your husband.  The best thing you can do for yourself as well as your children and spouse is to learn to ask for help and to a certain degree insist that you are given it.  It sounds like you are like a lot of women who want to do it all and while that is admirable in this situation it is not reasonable.  Therefore, learn to delegate.  Good Luck to you!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i can't tell u how u will do it but it will come once u have ur baby...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	The best advice I heard about time management was in regard to being a WAHM, which is what I currently am.  I don't always follow it, but it's good advice and it's simple:<br>  <br>  You can get a lot done in 15 minute chunks.  Meaning, just because the baby is going to wake up or need to be fed in 15 minutes doesn't mean you can't get half a task done now.  Don't wait until you have enough time, because you won't.  Just use the time you have, right now, and do some of it.  It really works.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	Nobody is given more than they can handle! You will all be just fine. You have lots of time to prepare still. Your daughter can probably car pool with another girl doing all these things? And there is always daycare if you cant leave work for long.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	Phew...sounds to me like you've got a stressful life already. I feel tired for your daughter just thinking about all those activities she is involved in..haha. I'm sure you will be able to handle it well though. There should be plenty of time for things if the family helps each other out. You won't be able to work for the first few months anyway so there you get some extra time. Your son should be able to help you out with the baby. Your daughter might be happy to cut down on some of her activities. Perhaps take a break from one, instead babysit the new baby so you can have a rest. They are both old enough to help you out with the baby.<br>  <br>  Talk to your family and make a plan before the baby is born.<br>  Good Luck!|`|bHAlwhTBaa	I am a busy working mom too.  Here are some things we do to save time: 1. We have a cleaning lady every few weeks, which helps a lot.  2.  We make crock-pot meals about 2x a week and other than that our dinners are very simple, or left overs!  We are concerned about saving money, so that helps our budget too.  <br>  3.  My husband and mom are helpful and cooperative, which allows me to get work done on weekends. <br>  4.  I recognize my shortcomings more than ever and do not try to make everyone in my life happy!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Your daughter may have to find a new *balance* in her life.  That may mean finding other rides sometimes for a few months or giving up one or two activities. And once in a while, you need to take a day off, send the baby to daycare, and your daughter to school.  <br>  <br>  My friend is having his second baby...and his first is 20, and in college!  His wife is 46, and just got laid off.  I dont want to preach, but it helps me to keep things in perspective when I remember that no matter how challenging life is, it could always be more challenging.  You should worry only about your baby*s health.  Everything else will fall into place.  :)|`|2dvXGnQPaa	If your son lives at home, make sure that he takes care of his own laundry as well as other chores around the house and yard.  If he doesn't, ask him to help out anyway.<br>  <br>  Your daughter has a lot on her plate.  She may need to find her own way to some of these activities, and may need to cut back a little, as well.  She should also be responsible for her own laundry and cleaning up after herself.<br>  <br>  Your focus should be just on you and the baby.<br>  <br>  You and your family need to discuss everyone's roles and responsibilities ahead of time because you're right - you won't have time to do everything.<br>  <br>  I've found that a little bit here and a little bit there works for me.  When I let things pile up, I get anxious.  You may wish to hire a sitter for a day while you take care of things, or you may wish to hire someone to clean your house once a week.<br>  <br>  When I was a teenager I had no idea how much my mom did to keep the house clean and everyone organized.  If you don't realistically think that your kids are up to the challenge, I strongly recommend hired help.  But that's just me, because I wish I had a nanny and a housekeeper.

My only real viewpoint is that they should keep the baby, and not get an abortion, because I'm not saying it's murder or anything, but they always say "It's better for the baby" when really, it's not. It's better for the teenager. And having the father stick around also helped that girl. That was a very touching video. Thank you!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I completely agree with the message of the video, age def. doesn't define what kinda parent u are, being responsible and mature, and loving and givin ur child what it needs and wants is what defines a good parent.  <br>  Course teens shouldn't go out and try to get pregnant, but if they do get pregnant accidently, then they should take responsibility for it and keep the baby instead of getting an abortion, or give it up for adoption if they have no support and no way of takin care of it.  Abortion should never be the answer to getting pregnant as a teen.<br>  My younger sis has proved that age doesn’t define a good parent, she was only 9 years old when she got pregnant (she was raped) and she kept her daughter and she’s a great mommy.<br>  Alotta the people I know say they are impressed with how good of a mommy she is, and how good of a mommy I am too.  I’m 17 and I have an almost 9 month old son.<br>  And just like the girl in the video said it’s not easy being a young parent, but I wouldn’t trade havin my son for anything and I know my lil sis wouldn’t trade her daughter for anything either.<br>  The lil girl in the video is adorable and the story is so sweet.<br>  Interestin video and thanx for sharing it, :D.|`|B5MDTdtPaa	teen as in under 18? if your still living with your parents, still in high school, are to young to have a job and sustain an income for your baby and you arnt in a loving relationship then obviously dont plan to have one! ...but accidents happen in life and i beleive its better to deal with it if you can-it is a baby afterall and its not their fault they were created..<br>  <br>  i got pregnant (planned!) at 19, baby was born when i was 20 - id lived with my fiance for over 2 years in our home, we had saved for a baby and both had full time career jobs and were in love so we had our daughter - best thing we've ever done - but we were in a committed relationship, had jobs and a house and a good income - make sure you have these things and are ready or use protection please :) xxx|`|jNgh3e3Faa	I was a teenage mother. <br>  This video is fine. <br>  Hopefully it does not give everyone a false sense of "It is okay to be pregnant as a teen".....|`|vj3WSxzWaa	I think that it is sad when a young person is pushed into adulthood so fast because of a childish mistake they made.<br>  I watched that video,and it is beautiful,,and I am very proud that things turned out they way they did for them and that they are still together,,,but,in most cases,that is not how things work out.<br>  It is very rare,I myself was born by a 16 year old mother,and my grandparents,thank god for them,cared for me most of my childhood life,,and I know a lot of teens and women who have had babies as teens,who still strugle to this day,because the father isnt around,they are in their mid 20's still with parents because they had unprotected sex.<br>  So I do not agree with teen pregnancy,but I do believe they can be good parents,,it is just very rare!|`|QQE58qFQaa	I watched the video and i think its true...<br>  <br>  I was 16 when I found out I was pregnant, I had my daughter at 17.

Otherwise we can't help u out.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	Tell her that you dont feel safe with her staying over by someones house...I agree; there alot of crazy things going on (parents molesting kids, bad family values, etc.) But maybe before you turn her down on staying with some friends; maybe you should get to know her friends and their parents before you let her stay with them...|`|XGgPhaDbaa	Just tell her the truth. That you don't trust the situation at her friends house and you would rather they stay at yours.

If not why can't she go to her friend's place?
0qP8gLpyaa	I was the same way when my son was that age. We didn't actually go out until he was about 2 months old after the doctor said it was ok- but she also said as long as flu or other illnesses are not rampant then it's fine to take them out as newborns even as long as they are warm enough and you don't allow people to touch or get close due to things that can be passed to a baby and not knowing what strangers may be carrying or exposing them to unknowingly.<br>  <br>  Put her in a stroller (if you have a travel system for safety reasons) and take walks around the neighborhood. You get exercise and baby will get some air and see the outside when they are awake.<br>  <br>  My husband and I did that and put our son in a snuggli at a park to walk on some of the shorter trails or just for a lunch outside when our son was little. He loved it and when he started sitting up on his own it was more fun because by then he was eating little puffs and small finger foods and could sit and have a snack and play on a blanket for awhile. <br>  <br>  In summer time you could even get a little blow up pool and put in the shade. As little as they are instead of water put some soft balls or toys in it to explore and play- if they can sit up well on their own then.<br>  <br>  Get some air drying clay and make hand and foot impressions with her. Those will be keepsakes you will want to keep forever and they are only little once.<br>  <br>  Go to the library if they have story time for little one's during the day. Even if your little one isn't reading, it's still beneficial to hear a story and you could check out some books to take home and read at naps and bedtime or other times during the day to her to help her with language acquisition.<br>  <br>  Put some music on and gently move with your baby. You can do "wheels on the bus" and gently move their arms for the wipers, rotate their legs as they lay down in a pedalling motion for the wheels, lift her up and down etc.  It's great for muscle building and exposing them to rhythm and music young.  You could also do quieter songs and do gentle back rubbing or rocking, swaying with baby etc.. to the music gently. My son loved it at that age.  Now that he's almost 2 he still loves music and dancing around with it. <br>  <br>  Soon she'll be big enough to start tummy time play on a soft mat on the floor with some soft toys to help her develop back and neck muscles as well as reaching and grabbing skills.  If you don't want to spend the money on a tummy mat you could use a soft-semi firm pillow with a blanket over the top to prop her up on and put a few soft toys around.  I did both with my son and it was frustrating to him at first but I kept at it for 30 minutes a day with him (broken into 15 minutes twice a day) and it really helped. Once he caught on to things he could do and reach he loved it.  <br>  <br>  At 3 months exersaucers became a life saver for me. It was fun watching my little guy play and explore and seeing what he would do if I mixed up the order of the doo dads on the tray or added something new.  <br>  <br>  Granted play time will be limited with her because she is still at the age that she will sleep alot, but when she is awake for those few moments in a day, take advantage of it.  The other thing that can help is to find a mom's group at a church or even a women's group to get involved in. Let husband or someone you trust to watch baby for a couple hours (they would at most need to give her a bottle and change her in your absence) and get out- even if it is just to the grocery store or to take a shower and relax for yourself while they care for baby in a different part of the house.  <br>  <br>  If nothing else, snap some photos during the day. They grow fast and you can never take enough photos at that age!|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I've been a stay-at-home mom for 8 months now. Some days I devote to cleaning, some days I spend my free time watching tv or napping while the baby naps, and some days we join a Mommy's Group in whatever activity they have going on. We do everything from touring the science museum to having lunch at someone's house. If you're interested in something like that, go to meetup.com and put in your zip code. Most cities have at least a couple of groups for stay-at-home moms. Good luck!|`|DhmUgq0maa	Yeah i am a stay at home mum of 3 under the age of 5!<br>  <br>  My eldest will be 5 in 2 weeks an is at school but i have a 3 yr old and a 8 month old.<br>  <br>  I take my kids out walking twice a day as it tires them out an they get some air and exercise...you could try putting your bub in the pram an just going for a walk if you get bored, or go to the beach for the day, scrapbook, make photo albums or you could even start an online study course...find a hobby that keeps you occupiedd.|`|Wb1ydezNaa	I was a sahm up until about a few weeks ago when my son started going to school full time,now I'm about to be back in the work field.it was basicly a typical day of cleaning house,playing and reading,errands etc.playdates and time with other sahm's is great especially when you've gotten everything done and your not sure what to do next,except grab the remote and reach for the tastiest snack in the cupboard,lol...|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	That's basically what my day consists of also including feeding the children, finding a time to shower myself, playtime with my daughter, oh and spending time on Y/A.

Those first few weeks can really give you cabin fever.  Find something you can enjoy on saturdays or an evening (while daddy keeps the baby) to keep yourself in touch with other adults.  Look for other mom groups in the area that have playdates at parks or go on walks together or other kid-friendly activities.  And find a hobby you can do at home.  With a new baby, you might take up photography or scrapbooking. You'll find your groove - one month is not much time.|`|70BWU1ODaa	HI, have you tried MOMS Club? It is an international club for stay at home or work from home moms that are available during the day. I joined it about three years ago when we moved to a new town when i was pregnant & had an 18mth old. We get together for play groups, outing, coffee, holiday parties, member meetings. We also have a newsletter & a yahoo chat group. See if your town has a club or start one yourself & find other stay at home moms who need support. It's a great way to make new friends& give your self a purpose outside the house. MOMSClub.org|`|jBnQiZVFaa	It will get easier as your daughter gets older.  Those first few months are kinda boring.  Try going to the library to get some books to read.  Or rent some movies.  I would take advantage of the quiet time you have now.  Soon she will be awake most of the day!  And then you can run errands with her, take her to the park to play, the library to read books, wherever she enjoys.  I like being a SAHM ten times better now that my kids are 2.5 and nine months.  They actually have things they want to do and I feel as though my day is not boring.  But just do what you enjoy for now, it will pick up soon enough.|`|0NX1vnSKaa	my son is 21 months old<br>  i clean, cook and all that<br>  i am also taking online courses to finish my bachelors degree (finishing in september!!!)<br>  now that it is getting warmer where i live, i take my son to the park a lot<br>  although with your baby being so young, there isn't much you can do with her yet. <br>  you can always take her for walk or go walk around your local mall. <br>  if you have any friends that are also stay at home moms, you could invite them over.<br>  i would also invest in some books.. its a fun way to pass time<br>  <br>  congrats on the new baby girl btw :)
R3WAqTCHaa	That is understandable. I'm guessing you two have been through a lot, just the two of you. So she doesn't want to share you with anyone. I would suggest doing some things alone, just the two of you. Make sure you re-assure her that there will be times that the two of you get to spend alone still. That she is still your baby girl. But explain to her that moms don't want to be lonely. That in order for you to be fully happy, you need a companion also. Tell her she will understand someday, but that nobody can ever fill her place. Spending extra quality time with just her sometimes will re-assure her that she is not being replaced.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest going out with the new family members and doing something really fun. That way, she will warm up to her new stepdad & step sister, and she will hopefully be more open to them joining her family. She just needs a little TLC.|`|c271e0d140cbe1902cabe87b6f0e3485aa	Look at things from her point of view - at the moment she has your attention, and soon she will have to share you with another child.<br>  <br>  That is like your partner or husband coming home and saying "Honey, I am bringing home another Wife - you'll just love her, she is great, you'll have so much fun together - and you'll have to share your stuff with her, and I'll be spending a lot of time with her too"<br>  <br>  Can you imagine that you would be thrilled with that?  Well, it is the same for her.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could talk to her again, and listen to her concerns, maybe you will have to make sure that the two of you spend one evening a week doing something together, just you two.  <br>  <br>  She will adjust, but for now she needs to know that she is special to you and that you will always make time for her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|2FfVsJi5aa	I'm sure she's feeling not replaced exactly, but more like she'll be getting less time and love from you. Try this: schedule atleast 1 hour a week (same time, same day EVERY week) that is exclusive you and daughter time, no stepsisters allowed (just don't say it like that because it sounds mean!!!). Go out, or do things you both really like so you can bond. Watch a movie, take a walk, go to the bookstore and have a contest to see who can find the funniest book title, do eachothers hair and paint your nails the same color, volunteer somewhere, take an art class at your community center. Do ANYTHING that will make great memories for her of spending time with you. Make sure you always make it a regular thing, so if she is mad that her new sister is getting attention from you she'll be able to say "oh wait, mom and i are hanging out on sunday, just us, so it's okay." Make sure she feels like it's "her time" and for that small chunk of time, you aren't thinking about ANYTHING but her. It might seem like you're spoiling her, but I'm sure she'll feel better. Maybe after a while you can even invite your step daughter!|`|EMgDhRnjaa	Just get some alone time with her. Explain things to her and that she'll always be special deep in your heart. Hopefully she will understand this, and just tell her how fun having new family members can be. It's like having a new best friend!|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	I was ten when my mom died<br>  I was ten when my dad remarried, the first time<br>  The second time, I was 12<br>  <br>  It's more than replacing you<br>  Are you getting married to a man with a step sister?<br>  Is there a reason she told you that<br>  <br>  <br>  The key is slow and steady<br>  First, long engagement, like a year a year 1/2<br>  One the weekend, have one night as joint family night<br>  She needs to get use to the idea, this will give her time. <br>  Also, during this time, take a joint family vacation<br>  This will give the girls time to bond<br>  <br>  One time a month, have a two of you only lunch or dinner, tell her that will continue until she does not want to go<br>  <br>  I can tell  you, it take time.

Also try to make her see how this could be an advantage to her.
6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	As much as you feel overwhelmed, so do those kids of yours. They are scared, confused and are crying out for attention, even if it is negative attention. Your 7 and 9 yr. old are not rotten, and I think that is very unfair calling two confused children rotten. How else can they express themselves? Think about it? Especially, when they probably miss their father, and were also subject to you and your husbands' problems even before you divorced. I feel for you, do not get me wrong, I have been a single mother of 2 for years, and it is very, very hard and I could not even imagine dealing with 5. You should give yourself  A LOT of credit. The only thing, I say, is try to put yourself in their little shoes and remember they are hurting too...probably pretty badly. Plus they really do  not understand what the hell is going on in the first place. Sit down with your whole crew over a favorite food(Pizza, ice cream, etc) and have a discussion and talk with them and try to explain to them at their level , what is going on,  and what they could all do to be happy and help you, most of all. If you take that time, they will feel , firstly, you love them dearly, which they NEED to hear, and secondly, they are making Mommy happy. Give them chores and rewards. But once a week, if you can get yourselves all together, have a family night. I know it sounds corny and maybe impossible, but it will work...THEY need consistency, love  and praise in this difficult time...and YOU need, if you can, to get out once in a while. Go to dinner with friends, go buy yourself a new shirt or shoes, or something, but most of all GIVE YOURSELF A BREAK...YOU DESERVE IT, MOMMY! Good luck to you, really.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Don't let them run your life. This is why I believe in spanking. If you gave them a spank on the bum every now and then, they wouldn't be running your life. Instead of letting them play while they are in a time out, take their things away from them. If they like video games, or television or any kind of toys. Take it from them! Make them EARN those things back. If they are in a timeout and they are not listening, warn them that if they don't listen they are going to get a spanking. Only warn them once. When they continue to misbehave, that's when you spank them. Not so hard that it leaves a mark.. because that would be abuse. It should be hard enough to let them know that you aren't playing games and you want them to behave. You mention you got a divorce, maybe that could be a cause. Try letting them to talk to someone so they have someone to share their feelings with etc.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	Is your divorce recent?  It sounds like their world has changed and they are crying out for structure and boundaries.  they need to know that you are still their rock.  I know you have a lot on your plate right now and probably don't feel like you have the strength and energy to deal with them.  But if you buckle down, you CAN get them under control.  They'll fight you on it at first and things will probably get worse before they get better, but it should only take a couple of weeks to start seeing some real results.  Have the older kids pitch in with the cooking and chores if possible.  If not, those things will just have to wait because these two little ones need as much of your undivided attention as possible while you re-establish order in your home.|`|HuKuyPcuaa	The last thing you said was the most important... "they were great before my divorce."<br>  <br>  Everyone needs to grieve and as parents sometimes we forget that our kids are hurting too. Even if we think they are not hurting, they sure are missing that extra attention they are now without.<br>  <br>  So here are a few suggestions:<br>  1. Get them in an after school program or try Big Brothers/Big Sisters.<br>  2. Allow everyone, including yourself, a time to vent. Control it in a safe environment where everyone is safe, both physically and emotionally. (That means no one gets to throw it back in any ones face later!)<br>  3. Ask family members, friends, neighbors,etc. to help watch the kids once a week. The sooner you get to feeling better, the sooner they will self regulate too.<br>  4. Call around and look for support groups. Sometimes even a local hospital will have a support group for kids dealing with loss. Many are covered by insurance or you can seek scholarships to help if your low income.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|qJaKF24naa	maybe its how they are reacting to the divorce. Try finding some kind of counselor to family counsel and help out. Or try sitting down with them and talking, maybe they are acting out because they need attention.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	I believe that by 7 and 9 years of age, time outs are no longer effective.  By this time you should be able to reason with them more.  If you are so overwhelmed by doing the house work, etc., enlist their help in the house work.  With six people doing the work it should take some of the burden off you and will help them to feel more connected as a family (strange, but true...misery loves company).  You can really push the "we are all in this together" idea.  They may be feeling the instability too and if you need to break down, you should excuse yourself and give YOURSELF a time out because they need to know that you are the stable force for them.  Simply refuse to put up with the whining and crying and tattling.  Tell them firmly but without anger that you will not listen to them when they whine and cry and if they are going to do that then they should go to their room and all contact with them should cease until they can talk normally.  Lay down the law!  YOU ARE THE PARENT.  You can do this!  I promise.  Remember...it is only temporary and tomorrow will be a better day.  It has to be, right?  It always helps me when I look at them sleeping.  I remember how they can be when they are not being little terrors.|`|AA12306871	I went through the same thing and I feel your pain, I have 4 kids!<br>  I made lists and posted them in each and every room of my house.  Rules and Consequences.  If they broke a rule the consequence was listed right there and they couldn't say they "didn't know" it wasn't allowed, or what not.  They also have chores, each and every day after school and on the weekends.  With doing chores came rewards.  If chores were done all week and they were allowed to have rewards.  Now there was a catch.....  If everyone didn't do their chores, no one got rewarded.  That forced everyone to work together and behave so they could ALL have the reward.  The older kids tend to get after the younger ones and so forth.  By the way, extra chores is a great punishment.  FOLLOW THROUGH!!!!  SHow them your the boss and your not gonna take the crap anymore!

KEu8nqEQaa	Not usually. Sometimes if you are super fertile you could fall pregnanct, but it takes time for the hormones to get out of your system. It took me 9 months to concieve after stopping the pill. Good Luck.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	It took me 11 months.|`|xYv4dfVQaa	Hello Samantha,<br>  <br>  First of all, all women are different. It's physically possible to get pregnant after missing as little as one birth control pill. In some cases you don't even have to be off them entirely to get pregnant. Most women do not get pregnat as soon as they stop taking the pill but its possible to ovulate if you miss one of your birth control pills. <br>  <br>  If you're trying to get pregnant, most doctors recommend you use an alternate form of birth control for at least 6-8 weeks after going off birth control pills. This is because the resideual hormones in your system may have an adverse effect on your baby. Wish you luck getting pregnant just take you take have fun and it will happen.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|eR5kvqI3aa	don't listen to the first guy... it'll take a good few months and the longer you've taken them the longer it'll take for your body to be capable... i'm not saying its impossible but the possibilities are low|`|PTLXDmG4aa	its pretty much out of your system by the time your on the sugar pills.. thats why you get your period 24+ hours after you stop taking the active pills..

Your estimated due date is Sunday, October 04, 2009, which means you're in week 9 day 4 of your pregnancy.
Fkl6gV8Qaa	Like the first girl I too think that it's important to know that you have a 38 day cycle. It looks like the online versions are right because I calculated you at 8 weeks with a 38 day cycle. That said, everyone is different and even though you are SUPPOSED to ovulate at a certain time in your cycle it doesn't mean that it actually happens that way. When your dr. tells you how far along you are before an ultrasound (and even after sometimes) it is just an estimate and you should think whatever weeks =/- a week.|`|qJaKF24naa	Did you doctor know you have longer cycles? Because then that would change everything.|`|CkkPaP8vaa	11 weeks is from the last day of your cycle.  1 week before you are futile, and it takes 2 weeks from a fertilized egg to travel from conception to implant.  Once it's implanted is when you truly are pregnant.  The dates you have been given by your doctor is the best measure they can seeing as knowing the exact day of conception is very hard to predict.<br>  <br>  This is why you get the two dates.  The shorter date is from conception.   It is best to find the lingo that most of the people around will understand.  Once you get to about 15 weeks this 2 week difference will be forgotten and you will think in your doctors lingo.   I was hung up for a while on that two week difference then I have happily settled with the doctors date understanding my due date could be 2 weeks prior to what was given or 2 weeks later.|`|hjLzSGV0aa	well i dont know where you live but<br>  here feb 14th was on a saturday|`|xrQQ9Zuyaa	Yes this is confusing, but I can explain. When doctors and midwives figure out how pregnant you are, they are using your last period as the start date. This is the historical way to it, 40 weeks from your last period is when you are due. The problem is that you do not become pregnant on the first day of your period, but at your ovulation time. Based on a 28 day cycle, this is 14 days after the first day of your period. So already we have a discrepancy. When you read about stages of development of your baby, that is weeks from the date of conception, not the last period. So by one method, pregnancy lasts 40 weeks, by the other it lasts 38. That explains the 2 weeks difference.<br>   <br>  <br>  However it is even more complicated, you have a 38 day cycle, 10 days longer. Your ovulation would most likely have been 14 days BEFORE the date you expected the period which did not happen. Best thing to do if you want to know the stage of development your baby is, take the date you expected the missing period to start, and subtract 14 days, take that as the day you conceived and go from there. Your due date is 38 weeks late<br>  <br>  Two caveats here, your health care person will likely still go by the original date they gave, and what I say here is only true if your periods were very regular at 38 days. <br>  <br>  I hope that I did not confuse the heck out of you!<br>  <br>  Oh! just read your follow up! Isolated intercourse is the very best way of getting the right date lol.<br>  <br>  And as one of the others says, a due date is really plus or minus two weeks anyway. Not an exact science.

6ZCxG454aa	laughing phobia|`|Q24QcYB8aa	It sounds like your child might be insecure. <br>  If they have experience a time when people laughed at them for something they did and made fun of [in a non-mean way].

She's now 25, well adjusted and loving life.  <br>  Go with it... be there and offer comfort until she understands. She's probably a smart cookie as is my daughter.|`|UQsRvCLgaa	It's a stage that kids go through even i was like that.|`|1U7yLEf9aa	My daughter did it too. She doesn't want the attention to be on anything but her or...... she doesn't want people to put the attention on her. It's confusing and VERY frustrating I know.

You need to remain calm and focus on what is right for you at this moment.  You can always give the baby up for adoption.  Your parents maybe upset but that is because you are so young.  If you plan to keep the baby get your plan in order so that you can continue your education and not let this stop you.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	carry ur baby to term and grow up since ure gonna be a mom .. and will have to take care of not only urself but also a child that u created <br>  <br>  or u can give it up for adoption<br>  <br>  or get an abortion|`|EYoyBdjpaa	I've had three pregnant teenage friends in the last year.<br>  One already had hers, but her dad has guardianship so she pretty much gave it up for adoption.<br>  One had an abortion.<br>  One's about four months, and she's keeping it and raising it herself.<br>  <br>  You need to buy a home test or go somewhere like planned pregnancy to find out for sure.

It's quite obvious your too young to be pregnant you couldnt even bring your words together to form a complete sentence. Youwere doing adult things so now it's time to grow up and take responsibility for your actions. Tell your parents first of all. So they can get you to a doctor as soon as possible. Second dont get an abortion. If anything give it up for adoption,.There are alot of couples out there who cant have kids who would love to adopt and give the child a loving home. And if it turns out that you arn't pregnant then DONT HAVE SEX! Focus on school. And if the scare wasnt a big enough scare for you get on some bc and use condoms!|`|AaxIZSTwaa	First, take a deep breath!! Have you taken a pregnancy test? You can go to a planned parenthood and get a test there. If you are, they can help you look at different options.

6qCnpxrNaa	First of all, I'm concerned that your doctor hasn't done more to identify for you what exactly the bump is.  As this is not normal you should have it examined and diagnosed immediately.  Likely, there is nothing wrong which is why it probably didn't bother your doctor but you still need to know for yourself what is going on.  Good Luck to you and your baby!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Is it on his gums?
6qCnpxrNaa	What I do is measure out the water in the bottle and then place the bottle in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes before mixing the formula in.  It only heats the bottle up just barely but my son seems to take it better than if it is cold or merely room temperature.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	It's really about baby's preference.  I only bottle fed with my first.  I warmed every bottle for about 2 months and then one night I was so tired I just gave it to him cold straight out of the refrigerator and after that he wouldn't take a warm one, he only wanted them cold|`|u94HOVz7aa	what ever your baby prefers is fine.  my son at that age would only drink warmed milk, but now he only wants room temp. formula.  (2 months now)|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	What I do is that I boil water and put into bottles. I pop the bottles into the fridge. Then when I'm ready to use them I warm them up by putting hot water into a bowl and sitting the bottle in it until the milk has sort of reached room temperature. Then I add the formula and shake well. Ready to go. <br>  <br>  It depends what babies like. You should be careful not to give them the milk to hot cos it will burn them and if its really cold it can give them a funny tummy.|`|4Bgw5xs8aa	Every baby is different. Some like it cold some like it warm. I've always done warm because I've hear cold milk can cause upset tummies..and my daughter HATES cold formula. Anyway, you don't have to use boiled water either. If you live in a place where the tap water is pretty good use it...if it's only moderate buy a brita filter for your faucet. You can get one for around 20 bucks and you'll save loads of time on boiling water for bottles. Plus the added flouride in tap is good for baby's teeth. Then you can just use warm tap water when making a bottle and it's that much quicker. You can look up facts and ask your doc about the tap water. It's a fact, though many older folks still believe the boiling water bit. Hope I helped!|`|chlvKoXqaa	NOT cold, about the temp of his tummy, or room temp. WARMED IS OK

ab4882a71906ff2572efc2ce7a218876aa	I agree with both of them. We can't really tell if your hymen is broken or not and there should be a thin layer of skin around the opening if its not broken. Its really hard to tell this things by yourself. Its really nasty and I think a Gynecologist is the only person who can really tell if its broken or not. If you are really curious about this then I recommend you meet a Gynecologist about this.<br>  And if you are curious about if its gonna hurt for you during sex, then, if its your first time it will hurt a little if you already broke your hymen and it will be VERY uncomfortable. And if your hymen isn't broken your hymen will be broken by your lover obviously, it will hurt A LOT and you will bleed (your cherry will pop).|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	There are 4 types of hymen<br>  <br>  1. no hymen<br>  2. full hymen (may have to see ob to remove it)<br>  3. hymen with several little holes'<br>  4. just one hole<br>  <br>  I have no clue to what kind you have but keep looking|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Can't say, there's always an opening and you can't usually see far in.

QvmHjhdsaa	My 3yo daughter has a siezure disorde (from your details yours is being treated for seizures right?) She really took a log time to focus on anything. We have had her eyes checked and she can see though really only things close to her. She honestly didnt start tracking things until she was over a year old. She does not reach for things even at 3 1/2 her favorite things are lights. Any toy that has lights she just adores and really will focus on and follow. You might try something like that. Also during therapy they use those sparkly pinwheel things and because they are that shiny coler and sparkly she really likes that as well. Some children with seizures will react to flashing lights. I was really worried at first using them with her so often. I talked to her neurologist and he said that not all kids sieze with the flashing lights and just to base what I do on her. If she likes lights and it doesnt bother her then go for it. Most other toys she couldnt care less about. But as soon as she sees those flashing lights her world is a happy place. <br>  <br>  You might just try finding the toy that your baby really likes it make take a while to figure out what that is (for us it was almost 2 years) just keep trying. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|V8GrFx0jaa	What does your doctor say?

God bless.|`|9J1Sl6X6aa	Take her to your Health Nurse, GP or pediatrician to assess her. She might be able to see but have a bad eyesight or there might be something else wrong. Also there might not be anything wrong with her. Perhaps there is too much to look at around her. Everything is still new for her. What did your health nurse say about her at her 4 month old check up? Were there any concerns? You should due for a 6 months check up (immunizations). Bring up your concerns with the health nurse as at 6 months I believe your baby should be looking back at you and smiling.|`|wp96lQjYaa	these could be signs of autism...b/c my neise and nephew did the same thing when they were younger, and they have autism, it comes out on tv..but u should research the signs of autism maybe your baby has more signs than u think..|`|3b5fec2693819d3031ce9fb49fdcd7ddaa	Call your doctor|`|S3qmkm2Vaa	call your dr and make an appt ASAP! this is a concern for a child this age!!!! seriously its better to be safe than sorry

Dc2SjoBxaa	The maximum is usually five days, and only if you have optimal cervical mucus, which is eggwhite or watery. Sperm last longer in that fluid, which peaks shortly before ovulation. If you have recently menstruated, or are due to again soon, sperm probably won't last more than a day or two, if they make it past the hostile cervial fluid you have the rest of the month. <br>  <br>  Here is more input and advice: <br>  <br>  <br>  It is a fact that sperm can live up to 4-5 days in your body, contrary to anything else you may have heard or read. In addition to this fact, the egg released can live between 12-24 hours. Therefore, your fertile period starts approximately 4-5 days PRIOR to ovulation and ends 12-24 hours after ovulation. If you do the math, it is possible for some woman to be fertile for as many as 7 days. You may have heard you can only get pregnant one or two days a month...SO NOT TRUE!!! You may only ovulate that long, but with the life of sperm and the life of the egg, your fertile time can be much longer. Another bit of info that many woman don't know is that female sperm are slower but stronger and therefore live longer than male sperm which are faster, but weaker. In other words, male sperm will usually beat out female sperm in the race for the egg, yet female sperm will usually out live male sperm. So, if you are trying for a girl, have sex the 5th, 4th, and 3rd day before ovulation and then abstain. <br>  It is not true that there is a difference between the live/speed of sperm depending on whether it's male or female. ALL sperm are the same basic genetic make-up. The differences lie in what genetic material is carried in the head of the sperm. <br>  <br>  <br>  From what I just read, approximately 3-7 days, depending on the acidity of the vagina. <br>  <br>  Depends on when she is ovulating. If there is a lot of mucus (usually a lot more when she IS ovulating), it can last up to 5 days. If not, usually about a day or two.<br>  <br>      <br>  (So with all this in mind it is possible you could be pregnant.  I would take a test.  Sometimes if you are not pregnant but you stress out and think you are pregnant your period will not come and your mind can actually make your body think you are pregnant.)<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything and make sure you are safe the next time you have sex.|`|GGigx9L9aa	well if your a teen then NO WAY MAN!!! if your a 18 year old or around that age then...... ummmm i guess maybe but trust me itll change ur life to hav kids.  and if ur 20 then u better hurry and think about it u will soon get too old|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	I had all that and i got my period today, i had cramping, sore nipples and breasts, nausea, swore i was pregnant..guess what?

I would wait till the first when your period is supposed to get here then take another test. you still could be pregnant and your symptoms only support that.|`|H3GrDAXPaa	go to the doctor to make sure you do not have a pregnancy outside the uterus - an ectopic pregnancy - this can be dangerous|`|WbsdtLgFaa	if you were experiencing pregnancy symptoms, the sickness, headaches, etc. then the test should have come back as pregnant...wait and test again would be my advice...wait until after your period is due|`|jop4Rjcqaa	no ur not pregnet u would of not got ur period at all unless u had a misscarriage
uVmwUqhIaa	During the first trimester, an abortion can range from $300-$600. During the second trimester, an abortion can run up to $5000 and more. When going to an abortion clinic, be sure to verify their certification and make sure that they have liability insurance. <br>  <br>  The choice to have an abortion is entirely in the woman's hands. Life does not begin until birth. Fetuses are not viable until 28 weeks. Do as you wish. Let the Christians say what they will. Life is said to start with breath, according to their Bible, and yet they somehow look over this.|`|r39EDGhPaa	It can range from 300-1000 dollars.<br>  Some places will do it on a sliding scale, though.  Depending on how much money you make.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|77NzfiVkaa	about $500 i believe in my state but depending how far along you are it can cost up to $3,000 dollars. After 11 weeks they start adding about $100 dollars to the original price for every week that goes by so you want to get it done early if you really must do it at all. After the second trimester no place will do it though, so you would just have to have the baby.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	Usually between $300-$500. Medical abortion (the pill) is more expensive than the surgical.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	a few hundred depending how far along you are... anywhere between 2 and 9|`|awUzUxo5aa	You pay for it for the rest of your life, not in money though....|`|JMJsCU1vaa	just one human life, and a lifetime of guilt|`|IhPzHK0Haa	Excuse me but all the people answering with words like 'murder' and 'guilt' etc - have you even considered what people go through themselves whilst considering an abortion?? It is the mother's decision so don't try and make her feel bad about 'lifetime of guilt' etc when she could have a perfectly legitimate reason for having one. I'm not saying they should be used as a contraceptive but sometimes abortion is the best way forward in some circumstances so leave her alone!!!|`|Ws1hky6Zaa	it depends on how far along you are, the sooner the cheeper.|`|klOP21xTaa	GOD IS WATCHING YOU.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	It cost a life of guilt dont do it|`|5LMm9AWZaa	it should be free at your local clinic|`|zF8Jsx33aa	it costs a life you r killing|`|lkMW2G35aa	free|`|cFfPVj9caa	it depends where u go<br>  but plz dont do it <br>  or tell the person ur asking for to not do it<br>  i dont think its fair and some of the most important ppl in my life right now wouldnt be here if their parents went through in doin what ur planning on doing =[|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	well looks like it will be costing a human life that you are murdering.<br>  :(|`|Pg3M8EvNaa	Depends.

1YdeUn1Caa	Why did you get pregnant again, when you can't even afford the 2 you have? Yes, adoption is better. To avoid problems with the father. On the birth certificate, just put unknown under father. That way you are safe. <br>  Next time be careful, if you can't afford anymore kids.|`|ScHW4842aa	you cannot provide for your two boys, so you have ANOTHER baby?<br>  <br>  Give it up for adoption. Although you probably wont be able to  because the father knows about it and his mother will also want to look after her.|`|d092475deaa61dba856bb6c8d78f69d3aa	I am sorry you are going through such a rough spot right now. I couldn't imagine having to decide something so life changing as this. It sounds as if adoption may be the best for the baby, you and for your other children. Making sure a couple that is going to take care your child and love him or her as much as you would is very important, and will make you feel a lot better if you do choose to put the baby up for adoption. <br>  <br>  I am sure there is help out there if you do decide to keep your child. There are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people everyday collecting welfare who don't really need it, and if you do need help with the baby than by all means I personally think you deserve a little help to get back on your feet. Moving to Georgia with your mom's friend may be what you need to get your life back on track.  If she is someone you truely know and trust then it might not be a bad idea afterall. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck and hope all turns out well.|`|jLppTLOmaa	it sounds like your options are tied down to foster care or adoption: Mind you, an open adoption is possible where you could still see your baby and get updates on her and everything, you would still be able to meet her :)|`|AA11828121	Ultimately you have to give the birth father his rights, since he is aware you're pregnant and it's his you can't give it up for adoption without his consent. <br>  <br>  If you're living with your mom can you not get on medicaid and have them pay for daycare while you get a job? Actually why am I asking, I know you can. <br>  <br>  I know it's hard, i'm pregnant and couldn't imagine being in your position but just think if the father takes the baby you will still have her in your life and maybe even custody when you get things together....|`|qN5iVvAFaa	Personally in your situation, I would probably give the baby the best life it could have and give her up for adoption, Pick her out a great family, that can give her everything she needs, leave it as an open adoption so you can see your daughter when ever... It is always up to you, GOOD LUCK.|`|wvrMda78aa	Wow, hun thats so much to deal with ur poor mind must be racing. I just want to tell u that even considering adoption for ur baby is a very sweet and selfless thing. U know they have what they call an open adoption where the baby can still be in ur life, that will probably make it a lot easier for u! Have u talked with his mom about things? Maybe she will help out more since its all on u. If u need someone to talk to u can email me at Slippedoncatpeecutmyleg_666@yahoo. com, hit me up if u ever just nned to talk, ur friend Laura!|`|0FwVGYEYaa	do what you feel  is the right thing, for all involved in this ,sorry for your hardship|`|1JsWMX0daa	you have say in who adopts your baby and can approve of the family if you insist on it. you can also start getting things started before you give birth. their are lots of loving parents who cant have a child and would pay anything for a baby. also, you could know who your baby went to and keep in touch with your child you want to see them and let him/her know that you love them and are still his/her caring mother. at least look into it. also, have strength and good luck with everything.|`|575w52loaa	You could always try for an open adoption, that way you can still be a part of your babies life and get updates and pictures.  You would know that she had everything she needed and you could still watch her grow and develop and then someday when she is old enough to understand you could explain the situation to her and chances are that she will appreciate being given the opportunity to have things.|`|IEzkCljmaa	i think you should do what you feel is right but o woould probaly move to savannah with your moms friend  hope that you figure it out and if u don't mind can you email me and tell me what your decisions were  good luck with u and ur boys :)|`|audGLNvxaa	I think you should definitely pray about it. You don't need to take advice from anyone here, you need to take a lot of consideration before you do anything. In my personal opinion if you cannot give the children the life they deserve then you should probably give them up for adoption. Adoption is a wonderful thing and many people who cannot have children would love to care for yours i'm sure. It's going to be hard if you decide to give them up for adoption, but you can still stay in touch and they will respect you when they are older for allowing them to have a good chance at life.|`|bc4782da989744a491a7587eecbb2a9faa	My boys are 23 21 18. I had my first at 17 and got married to the two oldest father at 18. got divorced by 22 and had my third son with a man that stayed only 3 years tops and just came back when he turned 17. They chat often and visit. It is very hard for him.<br>  <br>  You so need to think about this. I was given advise to give my children to my exes parents till I graduated college. I did not. Now I wonder what would my life and there be like if I had. Or if I would of went into a program with human services that would house and educate me. But I did not want to live with other single moms at 24. I thought I was past that. These things I am telling you over a 5 year time frame.<br>  <br>  Call theDepartment of human services. They have programs and housing. You can go to Job corp. Many many things to improve yourself as a person and mother. <br>  <br>  Why give up your youngest and not the others also. That seems unfair if you think the baby would get a better life then so would the other two older ones. Just think about that for a bit. it may seem harsh but it is just a thing to think about.<br>  <br>  Think also how much of this is hormones. <br>  <br>  Think about 20 years down the line.<br>  <br>  Talk to places like young mom group or first call for help.<br>  <br>  Good luck. With what you choose<br>  God Bless you life will get better if you let it.|`|f6JWEBdDaa	First of all, this is a decision you must make on your own, so please take all of the responses you get here with a grain of salt! <br>  <br>  Now...with that said...I'll simply say this...from my perspective...I am an adopted child, and I couldn't have asked for better adoptive parents than I have! I've been very blessed, and I am so thankful that my birth mother chose to give me the opportunity to have a better life than she thought she could provide! Who knows how things might be for me now if she hadn't had the strength to let me go? <br>  <br>  Thank you mom...wherever you are!!<br>  <br>  Hope this perspective helped! <br>  Best of luck to you and your family!  :-)|`|FPuyZCDVaa	Do what you feel is right in your heart. If you feel it may be too much financially, perhaps adoption may be best. However, it's a choice your heart will have to make. Awww I feel for you :(|`|Lc7IOjypaa	This is  a question that can honestly not be answered by people u dont know. <br>  But U think that ur situation isnt rare. Please know that there are so many other people that are going through the same things u are. maybe worse. So u are not alone. <br>  Are u able to get help with welfare, anykind of agency that might help you get on your feet. there are so many programs that the government can help you with. And ohh geeze you are so young to have three kids and be forced to make such a dicision . <br>  All that i can say is before you give the baby up just go over all your options two more times. Make sure that you are going to be able to be emotionally there when your two other children need you. make sure that u are going to be able to live with that for the rest of your life. Because no matter what anyone says . Like u said u feel selfish. U are going to endure so many things after you give that child up, and not only will the child deal with that you will deal with that as well. <br>  Also think about in 18 years if your kid comes back and asks why?  U are gonna have to have an answer. <br>  I think that this is a tough decision and no matter what anyone says on this yahhoo chat crap. Go with your heart.<br>  I wish u the best of luck. <br>  I am an adopted child so maybe you can get the other point of view before hand. write me if u need to. moral support is the number one thing u need right now. <br>  Good luck with your boys, and im sure u will make the best decision for YOU
S3qmkm2Vaa	Blood test is 100 percent effective- it is always better than a urine test. the pregnancy hormone can take a while to build up and show up in your urine but it will be in your blood from the moment of conception (if you really are pregnant) i knew within a few days of fertilization literally|`|AA11828121	Blood test is much better and far more accurate, it can tell within 2 weeks of conception, which means if you had sex 2 weeks ago, it would give you a positive result now.|`|gFiRi5xnaa	The urine test can tell you around a week before your missed period at the earliest. The blood test is said to be more accurate, but they're both exactly the same, plus you get instant results with a urine test. Just know that that's the first thing they do at your first doctor appointment, along with checking for STDs and things like that is to give you a blood test taking 6 viles of blood, it sucks..|`|h48LxmzJaa	I recently became pregnant and my doctor didn't bother with a blood test.  they said if the urine test came up positive twice, I was good to go.  sorry don't know the answer to the first question (because the doctor didn't bother with one)|`|rxrw4WNRaa	2 weeks after sex  is the standard on both tests.

h48LxmzJaa	There's a book called: THe fastest Way to Get Pregnant Naturally.  YOu might want to check it out.  The most important thing I learned was that sperm stays alive for up to 3 days inside of you,  So, if you don't know when exactly you're ovulating, but you have a good guess, you should have sex once a day (only once!) for a range of 5-7 days.  Then, the sperm will live for an additional 3 beyond, so chance are good it will be there when the egg is released -- even if you don't have sex on the day or the day after it's released.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	Go buy an over the counter ovulation predictor kit.

I know if you take mucinex it helps loosen up your cervical mucus making it easier for the sperm to swim and get to the egg.  Have you tried Ovulation predictor kits they help tell when you are going to ovulate.  I also hear the old wives tell that you need to lay in bed after the deed is done for at least 5 min with your butt propped on  a pillow and then go clean yourself up.  Get onto the webmd community board for trying to concieve and those people there are really helpful with this stuff.  Good luck!!|`|l1kO1Y67aa	Me and my hubby wanted a baby so we had lots of sex every day, and after I would get a pillow and put it under my butt so the sperm would not get out lol.

And 3 weeks later we had a baby on the way!|`|1vV9K4QXaa	I agree with previous answers. You should get a kit that predicts when you are most fertile. Also, there are certain positions that you are sometimes more likely to conceive in.

dCVVP3hmaa	I have suffered with pregnancy piles for all 3 of my pregnancies - they don't always go away after pregnancy, you just have to watch that you don't get constipated (pushing and straining will cause the haemmeroids to pop out).  I think once you have them, they never disappear.  You may not have trouble with them during labour - I never did. There are creams on the market which can be purchased from pharmacies which relieve them.  Sometimes a very hot cloth on the area soothes them and makes them shrink (TMI I know!).  Just try to stay regular, and they shouldn't be an issue.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|qJaKF24naa	I do not have them but I would think they will go away afterwards.. maybe with some medicine!

CkkPaP8vaa	It all depends on your works acceptance of this.  If you have people around you that are pregnant how long did they wait?  You can’t hide the doctor appointments and the gaining weight for long after 18 weeks.  Not saying wait that long.  Also most wait until after 13 weeks and they hear the heartbeat so as to assure they have a successful and healthy baby before spreading the news.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	I had told them when I was about 4 months pregnant. Unfortunately it was the worst thing to do and my boss had no sympathy for me at all. I was sick a lot in the beginning and had problems that included me going back and forth to the doctors. My employer acted like she was annoyed that I became pregnant and couldn't work as much. Not to mention I used to lift huge boxes of files to move them to my desk to work through them and they could've cared less regarding me doing heavy lifting and being pregnant. Sometimes it's joy announcing to everyone other times it can backfire with people acting very crabby towards you.<br>  <br>  On your hand, just be patient and let the days roll by. When the timing is right to announce you'll know and be able to feel it. Best of luck with the rest of your pregnancy.|`|yklJCCTlaa	please wait until you finished with the first trimester!  i know you're excited and want to share it with everyone but the chance of miscarrying your first child in the first trimester is 50/50. Once you pass that 3 month mark, in slim to none. So try to keep it to yourself...you don't want to tell everyone and then god forbid have a miscarriage and have to repeat yourself to everyone that you lossed it.. <br>  <br>  p.s. i had a miscarriage..|`|D5cOFZdwaa	I couldnt wait to tell mine. so i told em asap. and then they were super protective to make sure i had a good pregnancy|`|kgE96Nhcaa	I am due early September and I work at an elementary school.  It was actually quite funny, we were going to wait till the 13 week mark but it just wasn't meant to be!  I had the fourth grade teachers coming to my office to pick up medicine and I kept on bursting out into tears, my eyes were all blotchy and I was trying to hide it, I'm sure they all thought I lost it that day!  I went home talked with my husband and we drove to both our parents houses that night to tell them that we were pregnant (6 weeks).  The next day we both told our work (my husband figured if I was going to tell so was he haha).  It really helped, my co-workers understand why I go to the bathroom umpteen million times, they cover for me when I really have to go puke, they help me out with heavy lifting etc and I usually don't even have to ask, they see and offer.  It has been awesome having this extra support!  I was also at risk of miscarriage and I am considered high-risk and can understand you wanting to wait. However, consider the extra support you will get and the understanding from those around you.  If I have to go to two doctor appointments in 1 week they wont even bat an eye.  Where as if I wasn't saying anything they would really wonder what was going on and the rumor mill may have possibly started you never know.  I am very pleased with my decision, I hope this helped:)|`|mgiJVjaKaa	I am in the same boat, it's hard!! <br>  <br>  When my husband first found out, he insisted we wait until we were 10-12 weeks along to tell everybody. But as soon as his friend called he wanted to tell him he was so excited. So before the end of the week all of our close friends and family knew.  He also wound up telling nearly all his coworkers out of excitement...lol<br>  <br>  I'm a graduate student, so I did tell my adviser about a week after I found out. Mainly because it's a lot of coordinating in graduate school - will I take a quarter or a few off, do I qualify before or afterwards, etc. I also went and told my graduate coordinator to get information on resources. Besides them, though, I have only told one officemate and that's because I know she isn't going to tell anybody, she has several children of her own, and I wanted to get her advice on being a parent and graduate student. <br>  <br>  So I think probably don't tell anybody until you tell your boss. But depending on your job and how much will need to get coordinated (like time off), you might not want to wait until the 3rd month to tell your boss. You can always wait to tell the rest of your coworkers later if you decide to.|`|qJaKF24naa	I told my work the first time I was pregnant and had a miscarriage.. It was really rough espiecially because I told my sup to tell everyone so when I came back they wouldnt be asking about it.. Well she failled to inform everyone or they just did not listen and the first day back was horrible. <br>  This time around when I got pregnant (BTW I left that company and started back the week after I found I was pregnant) But decided not to tell because 1 I just started back and 2 if the miscarriage happened again. I have kept it a screct until I hit my 20 week mark last week! It was soo hard espiecially because there are about 6 girls pregnant in there besides me and its seems from me listening to them talk about it we are all right around the same due dates... <br>  But I told them why I wanted and she understood, now the battle with HR for time off! <br>  <br>  Honestly regardless of what you choose they will be excited and support you regardless of what happens! And its so hard to hold it in it is more fun to have people to talk to about it! :) <br>  Yes tell you boss first the first time round my boss found out last and she looked kind of disappointed to be the last to know!

We are just hoping it doesn't happen soon.<br>  <br>  I suggest telling them your pregnant, you very happy and would love them to be happy for you and with you during this exciting time. As that they please keep negative thoughts to themselves as you already know how they feel. etc. Good Luck|`|HQf3QPUMaa	Just say it.  Don't think of anything cutsie to do because honestly, they'll be too pissed to appreciate it.  Next time you're over for dinner, tell them "We have exciting news, we're expecting a baby".  The more they see that you are okay and happy with the baby, the more easily they'll adjust.  If they see you nevous and scared it will add fuel to the fire.  They may just be mad until you deliver but once that baby arrives, all will be forgotten.|`|JuWL7T0Haa	Congratulations!  Maybe you can have them over to dinner or something so you can tell them face to face.  Tell them you are aware of their beliefs but with all due respect it's your lives and you are living it the way you BELIEVE it right.  You are supporting your other 2 children well correct?  If you are in financial trouble and hardly scraping by than I understand their point it's irresponsible to bring a baby into that but if that isn't the case than it's their loss if they can't be happy for you and be happy about their grandchild.  Don't let ignorant people stand in the way of you being happy about this!  It's a happy time!  Don't let anyone take that away from you.  You are engaged anyways so you will be married soon enough.
MXXOICquaa	u can have sex as long as u want unless the doctor says not to its actually good for ur body and the baby|`|AA11764194	Sex thru out the pregnancy is safe unless you are in high risk pregnancy.. however talk to your Doc..<br>  <br>  good luck|`|cfdooGylaa	Sex during pregnancy is completely safe up until labor unless complications arise. Your doctor would tell you if its unsafe to have sex.|`|f6aqMg97aa	Sex is completely safe.  You want to be sure that you and your partner are not with other partners...  Just throwing it out there you never know...  Anyway if you have different partners then STD's can be a problem which can be dangerous to an unborn child.  Unless you are a high risk pregnancy than you can have sex up until delivery....  Also, closer to delivery it can help induce your labor it will soften the cervix... .

bc4782da989744a491a7587eecbb2a9faa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Is he just fussy? maybe the temp has changed outside making it cooler or warmer in the house then he is use to.<br>  Are there new things going on in the house, More guest?<br>  <br>  Or is he crying as in pain, Pulling his legs to his chest and thrashing his arms?|`|7PXFXcKfaa	entirely possible ... however what is much more probably is that he is going through his 6 week growth spurt...<br>  <br>  Colic is not really just "fussiness" , its at least 4 hours of incolsolable crying at least 3 days a week ... if it was colic you would definately know what it was, because you would be crying just as much and as loudly!! <br>  <br>  i would give it a few more days, youll probably find it subsides when your milk supply gets up a bit or he stops growing as much.|`|e5CuEiPfaa	My daughter had colic from day one, so yes they can. One of the best things that helped my daughter was swaddling. Here is a website that has a ton of info on it. <br>  <a href="http://www.colic-baby-bootcamp.com/swaddling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.colic-baby-bootcamp.com/swadd...</a> <br>  I really know how it can be so frustrating to hear them cry all the time, but I promise, it will get better. My daughter finally straightend out around 6 months. Also, someone mentioned the mylicon drops, and personally it was like giving my baby water. Maybe give it a try, it may help your child though. Also call your childs dr. They can probably give you some names of some otc meds. They have a lot for babies and toddlers in the laxative section at pharmacies and walmart! <br>  Hope some of this helps, and I hope he gets better!|`|JuWL7T0Haa	very possible!  my daughter had it but it usually goes away on its own around 14 weeks of age.  we had to give my daughter mylicon gas drops and they seemed to do the trick SOMETIMES lol just stay calm and take a break if you need it!  good luck|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Colic begins at about 6 weeks, and peeks at 10 weeks, so it is very possible.  I would call my doctor.  He/she should be informed.|`|rSxSV6tfaa	Oh yes most defiantly he can. Just get him some malacon drops they work wonders i promise.
GGAgxzJNaa	Tell your boyfriend to start acting like a father and deal with it.  He may not be a husband any more but he's always going to be a father.  This shouldn't be your responsibility.|`|kj507W26aa	If she told you, that means one thing. .....she's crying out for help.  kids her age dont think its a big thing, but it is. Look at how much she's changed.   You really need to talk to her, ask her to open up to you, what is causing her to do this, what is her pain, tell her about the long term effects of her doing drugs.  Tell her not to do just because everyone else is doing it, you need to talk to her, but I wouldnt tell her mom.   I would have a good heart to heart talk with her dad (your boyfriend) and make him see just how much this is ruining her life.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	you need to tell her mom and dad..it is essential to tell them..she wil be madbut she needs to get straightene out fast|`|zYiTRHtHaa	When you say she's changing, that could just be the fact that she is growing up, she is a teenager. <br>  all teenagers change. <br>  <br>  but whatever you do DON'T tell her mum, it will ruin your relationship with her. <br>  <br>  If you think it's becoming a major problem talk to her and her friends about it first.|`|bYU77eteaa	Tell her dad to tell her mom.  That would be better and you would get your point across either way without stepping on toes.<br>  Either way she has to do something about it.  I understand you concerns but right now isn't the time to be her friend.  its the time to be her mom.  When she's older it will get better.  It always does|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	Your not her mom- that means you do not have the right to punish her, but you can still talk to her about her behavior and what is going on in her life.  If her dad knows, you just need to step back and let him be the parent.|`|HOdblqIkaa	talk to her again with her dad in the room <br>  tell her if she doesnt listen and make a change soon then youll have to tell her mom <br>  you cant really play the good guy in a situation like this but its better to have her mad at your for a while then her being an abuser and die. pot isnt too horrible but it is called the gateway drug for a reason, and drinking is just stupid at her age with all the trouble she can get into <br>  -mip<br>  -rape<br>  -alcohol poisoning <br>  -car accident<br>  im sure she wouldnt want to go thru any of those. theres a time to be a friend and a time to be a parent and now you need to be the parent.|`|gmaCvh00aa	Screw worrying about whether she gets mad or not--TELL HER MOTHER.  She might hate you for a while, big effin deal if she does.  Would you rather keep your mouth shut to appease a drinking teenager and then she turns up dead one day and you didn't do whatever you could have?<br>  <br>  And how does her FATHER know and isn't doing anything about it?  Does he think it will just go away by itself?<br>  <br>  You seem to be the only thinking person in the house, so please tell her mother.  You might save her future, if not her life.|`|0pFMFkXDaa	Since she trusts you, you need to be the role model. Get down tough and make sure it is clear that drugs are not okay. She will take it more seriously coming from you than from her mom. If you whip out the seriouse talk and she is still doing them, then I'm afraid you'll need to tell her mother/father. Hope I helped!|`|4ahUadqxaa	SHE'S 14.  You should tell her mother.  She probably will hate you until she's 18 or 19 and then she'll thank you.<br>  <br>  I understand that she's your boyfriend's daughter and you love her but if you really love her you would tell her mother.<br>  <br>  You're saving her life, not making it worse.|`|QJ7ogJloaa	theres not much you can do cuz if she doesnt knowledge that she has a problem or anything and thinks its fine. there is just not too much that can be done.|`|5i1J2RLLaa	Betray her trust. She might get mad at you now but you are saving her future in the long run.|`|GAvwDkVnaa	stop it now it might not seem like the trusted thing to do but you got to stop it for her and her dad.|`|I64JOuMKaa	Well if she isn't telling you much anymore she might think you're not trustable.<br>  <br>  I think her mom needs to know.. she needs help if she isn't going to listen to you or her own father.<br>  <br>  But the thing is, if she finds out you're the one thaat told her mom, she's never gunna trust you again.<br>  <br>  Maybe get your boyfriend to tell her mother , since your boyfriend already knows and he's not doing anything?<br>  <br>  Maybe take away her allowance until she stops, tell if she doesn't pull her grades up she gets no new clothes etc .<br>  <br>  It might work , girls always need clothes!<br>  <br>  Oh and take away her cellphone, she will be devestated but motivated to stop.|`|i9vi0AKtaa	You have the right idea, she may be addicted or become addicted and then who knows where she will end up.<br>  <br>  Tell her that if she doesn't quit, you will tell her Mom.  If she keeps doing drugs, well then just tell her Mom.  Do not confuse friendship with parenting.  I know you are not a parent but 9 years of being with her father makes you as good as a parent.  If you care for her, you will get her to stop at all costs.|`|PqUXnWZGaa	you should definitely tell her mom, this could be serious, and if u really care about her,  u should do what's best for her, not what she thinks is best for her, how does she know what's best for her in this case? If u don't do anything about it know, it will most definitely hurt her in the future and she won't have a healthy life.|`|ivejg4whaa	I think you should really encourage her father to tell the mother, I know that you 2 may be close and all but I don't know that it would be your place to contact her mother to tell her.|`|S5l6A8z8aa	it's really hard when it comes to that situation, i think you should call a expert for that specified help, you never know what can happen?<br>  <br>  give it a try?|`|WucsQF76aa	Try helping her and convincing her she needs help if it doesn't work then you are only betraying her for her own good later on she will definitely appreciate you more for that push..|`|cFfPVj9caa	tell her mom but make sure she doesnt tell her daughter that it was u who told her

80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	The Raffle is an awesome idea, I'm doing one too with my babyshower in a two weeks. :)<br>  <br>  As for how to mention it, either include a piece of paper with the invitations that you can print out from home including what the raffle is for (the 40.00$ to Target) and what you can do get into the raffle. It is also helpful to say that they can buy a ticket with something small like 2.50$ or so, that way whatever you need that you did not get during the babyshower, you can have some extra money towards getting them. Also, if you want, since you are using a sheet of paper for this, you can include on the bottom, or top, half of the paper what you still need. Let's say you have a car seat and stroller but that put you out of the way of getting a bouncer for the baby, you can mention you need a bouncer. Some people are very open to giving the new mommy-to-be more expensive items. I got a 300.00 rocking chair from my grandmother mentioning I wanted to set up a nursery! If you don't want to go and buy some pretty paper to do the lists on, you can also use these Microsoft Office Templates, which are free! <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/CT101527321033.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templa...</a><br>  <br>  And you can find poems almost anywhere. :) Here's a few links for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.cutest-baby-shower-ideas.com/baby-shower-poems.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cutest-baby-shower-ideas.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.babyshowerscentral.com/poems.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyshowerscentral.com/poems....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.indianchild.com/baby_poems.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.indianchild.com/baby_poems.ht...</a><br>  These are just the first links from Google's 'baby shower poems' search. :)<br>  <br>  Hope all this helped you out! Congratulations, by the way!|`|8Rn2pX4jaa	I love the supplies idea... that is so cute!  You can never have too much diaper cream!

I think people like to know so that they can buy you something useful rather than getting you a bunch of stuff that someone else will already buy or that you don't need.  Especially if you have a wide range of items and prices on your registry.<br>  <br>  Have fun!  Sounds like you have a good one planned!|`|GzXDRRYLaa	just as u said it sounded great|`|gaiCNtEFaa	I think people like to know where you are registered.

Just make sure you stick with it.
quNfHZULaa	Hi, this is CrAzY LaDy again, i just changed my name from before. When I had my preemie I stayed at the hospital most of the day. I normally stayed by my babies isolate and either held her or just looked at her. They can give you a rocking chair to sit there beside him, if thats all you do is sit there and do a word puzzle, at lease your there. You can ask to bring in a stereo and play soft music, anything to stimulate you baby. I took a lot of pictures, their are memories there that you wont want to forget. His is a preemie yeah but he is a newborn too, they sleep alot, he still needs you there. If you need to, take a break, go eat something, go to the waiting room and watch TV, and when you are relaxed again go back in to see him. One thing me and my husband did was get really involved in my daughters care. We would ask the nurse to let us change my babies diaper, feed her(by N-G so we just mixed her milk up or poured it into a tube) but still, that is something. I know how it feels, right now you don't feel as much like a mom cause you can't really be the one to take care of your baby, so jump in there. Help track his weight, ask the nurses what you can do, they want to help get you involved. Something else we did was used one of the computers in the hospital lounge to blog about our baby. Basically make a place where people can go and read updates, that way you wont have to call everyone everytime something changes. I hope this has helped. Hang in there, it can be a hard road, but it will pass, I promise!|`|Ojgqd4xNaa	You can be there.  Why would your husband have to call you to see your son?  I wouldn't leave my child's side, until they kicked me out of the hospital!|`|rvoo4rBjaa	You didn't say his age or what was wrong.  Perhaps a story some nice music,just doing what you are doing is  good also.Pray tell him how important he is and how much you love him? Why did your husband call you ? maybe he felt you needed to be there to spend more time with him?|`|GBHVkElWaa	Love him. Talk to him. Stay close. That energy will be good for him. If you are allowed to hold him, do it! Do it with the support of someone if you are scared. Have a nurse pass him to you while you stay seated and comfortable. Tell the nurse your fears and that you would like some help. Your holding him will be good for him. He will be okay.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Well all you can do is what your doing now, let him know that his mommy is there, rub on him, and if you can hold him then do that. But if you can't  hold him all you can do is touch him and love on him.|`|weA0Xdszaa	Is your baby in intensive care? sounds like it. A preemie?<br>  Talk to him smoothly. Hold his hand. It does matter. Give him all the love you got. Look at him and let him look at you. It's bonding.|`|Faetahqfaa	Just show that you care|`|Tj2jMlTvaa	I know that it maybe hard and that it may not seem like you are doing anything right now, but you carried that baby for nine months he knows your voice and recognizes when you are around, and for him to be a preemie and sleeping all the time sweetie that's what they do, but just go to the hospital and be there for your baby, he needs you right now.|`|AA10043878	Babys do alot of sleeping. That's normal. Your feelings that you are afraid to drop him or handle him too rough are NORMAL too. Calm your fears by having a nurse show you the PROPER way to handle a baby, support thier neck, lay them down, etc. Gain even more confidence by holding him over a bed or any other soft AND close surface. Whenever possible, always have SOMETHING between the baby and the floor, street, etc. A fall from 4 inches is far better than a fall of 4 feet.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, just remember: You are a Mom and mother's have a natureal instinct. If you "follow your gut" and use some common sense; then mothering wont seem like Rocket Science.|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	Whats wrong with him? :-(|`|mFEevGRXaa	i think you need more detail in your question|`|t0VQGp0Jaa	pshh you know what to do

d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	No it doesn't. Stretch marks are solely the result of the rapid stretching of the skin associated with rapid growth. Hormonal changes and genetics influence the skin's capacity to withstand stretching forces, as do diet  and possibly exercise. This is my fourth baby and i have no stretch marks. My mother had 4 and has no stretch marks. My sister just had her first baby and has them pretty bad. It depends on the person and how fast you gain weight.|`|WvWFmwQoaa	well it really is a number of things not just one. i think it is the stretching of the skin because you wouldn't get stretch marks if you were really skinny and had a flat stomach would you? i think stretch marks happen when you gain allot of weight in a short amount of time, gaining allot of weight will make you become bigger/larger and your skin will stretch quickly and will rip your skin and there fore you will get stretch marks..<br>  im am 33w 4ds and i have no stretch marks yet although i was skinny and had a pretty flat stomach before i was pregnant i haven't got any stretch marks yet because i have not gained allot of weight in a short amount of time but on the other hand i have got a couple of little ones on my boobs due to how quickly they grew in the first few weeks of pregnancy so it goes on how fast your body puts on weight and how much it has to stretch.<br>  to reduce stretch marks you should drink plenty of water and keep your skin hydrated and moist by using a good skin lotion like Johnson's, dove or any other hydration lotion and also i have herd that bio oil does some good work as well..|`|B0bWrvanaa	yes it does. believe me. the only thing that you can do to make stretch marks lessen is not scratich and buy cremes with elastin in it. thats all you can do. chances are if your mother has it, you will too. i didn't get mine til i was 8 months pregnant and its just gotten worse and i use the creme twice daily.<br>  <br>  i use mustela...they have a whole line of stretch mark cremes, breast cremes (but i use the stretch mark cremes on my boobs) and sensitive baby products.<br>  <br>  when youre scratching your skin your irritating it and therefore as it stretches and thins...can cause stretch marks.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	i heard that as well. and im just sticking to it .. i dont wanna risk it .. just lotion, rub and massage ur belly when it itches ,, dont scratch just to b safe|`|04cb1ddfb1d88e39bb724bd942a734a6aa	That is absolutely ridiculous nonsense! Your belly itches because the skin is stretching-- this is totally normal. During my pregnancy, I would come home from work and strip off my clothes and scratch my belly like crazy-- I never got any stretch marks. No cream or lotion is going to prevent them either, nor will drinking extra water or the other ludicrous things that people come up with. Good diet and nutrition are essential and undoubtedly factor in, but basically whether you get them or not is just a function of heredity, how much weight you gain, and how quickly.|`|yFWAjOKmaa	No, cause either which way, your skin will stretch. I heard, that scratching just makes its worse, but i scratch mine all the time, & they seem fine to me? My mom's side of the family always got stretchmarks during pregnancy, so i find it normal. CONGRATS!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I don't know if it's a wives tale or truth, but I didn't scratch. I'm 38 weeks (in about 4 hours) and have no stretch marks on my belly. (I have a road map of california on my butt!)|`|hjLzSGV0aa	no scratching does NOT cause stretchmarks<br>  <a href="http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/preg_itching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenshealthcaretopics.com/pr...</a>|`|1o820L3Daa	No, Im 24 weeks and have scratched and still have no stretch marks. Try using cocoa butter. You may have dry skin thats making you itch more. That should help.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Well thats what i heard. And I dont wanna risk it so I dont scratch i rub or put lotion on. And I'm 22 weeks with no stretch marks :). So so far its working for me.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	No it doesn't. I scratched mine and had no stretch marks, on my belly anyway.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	No.  You are right, it's genetic.  It depends on a combination of your natural skin elasticity and how big you get.
LDYAGJCxaa	Well, I was into maternity clothes when I was 8 weeks along with my second pregnancy...although I'm pretty sure it was the pregnancy bloat and not the baby's size.  Either way, I couldn't button my jeans!  I have heard that women seem to start showing earlier in their second pregnancies.|`|AA10015577	You could be but it's hard to say because everyone and every pregnancy is different.  In subsequent pregnancies you tend to show earlier than your first.  Good luck|`|ied3Ww49aa	Well every pregnancy is different, with my first pregnancy I started showing very early, around 3 months. I am currently 32 weeks pregnant with my second child and did not start showing until the end of my 7th month! Even now I am not in maternity clothes.|`|DrFkFu3daa	I suppose it depends on if you are small-framed (which tends to show earlier) and how tall you are. Really by the 8th week, even at your second pregnancy, you will probably just be bloated.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	Im 20 weeks preggo and I just now started showing. You should be fine good luck. But this is my first pregnancy and they say in your second you show quicker.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	my sister is pregnant with her 2nd .. and she gained 10 lbs within the first 10 weeks <br>  <br>  you might be bigger at that point but everyone is different.
0qP8gLpyaa	Yeah, it's very rude. It doesn't say much for the courtesy of your friends either. <br>  I think I would either offer to drive (if you can) or arrange to ride together. If it happens again then I think you need to find some new friends.|`|Jucak0HLaa	Kinda,but you should have had a ride yet.But I mean if they invited you yeah it is.But it's a public place,so if you were inside chances are that nothing would happen.|`|JpmKtpqmaa	I think it is rude and not to mention dangerous...I cant believe those parents/friends left you there...maybe you shoud just call your ride ahead of time like 10 min befor the movie ends so you wont have to be there by yourself but just make sure you wait until your bestfriend's ride picks her up|`|ddP3klT3aa	I think its rude.|`|wdnbwViFaa	yes, it is rude|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	yea it is.|`|Is26eHnVaa	hell yea that's rude! i hope you said something. if you didn't say anything about it then that's just kind of saying its okay to ditch you again. ask if they will stay with you next time.|`|y94jsgbCaa	Yes it is. My friends would totally wait for me to get picked up or offer to take me home. I would do the same for them.|`|uhKQhHgMaa	I think next time you should tell your friends how you feel  about being left alone late at night ,and tell them that you will be happy if at least one of them can stay with you until your ride comes!!|`|Ij8OBOYqaa	that was rude|`|rnaq8Yp9aa	yea
kUCVLuTPaa	wel..i dont know if this'll help.....but i had a "period" that was regular but it only lasted for two and a half days days then it stopped after that 6 days later i had light bleeding for a day which i found out was implantation bleeding|`|7SVLjYHiaa	read my story: <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090226190758AAGitmi">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  I just had basically the same thing happen.  3 periods in one month and have never had it before.  Maybe some of the information in my question could help.  bleeding after sex is def. not normal that is the extent of that I have learned.  You need to get to a doctor though.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	I think you've had 2 periods this month. Typically implantation bleeding only lasts for 1-2 days and it's not dark. It's normally only when you wipe and you won't need a pad or tampon. It shouldn't be red either, it can only be pinkish color to brownish discharge. Good luck and tons of baby dust to you. And...stop making yourself go crazy, things will happen when you least expect it.

4iXL4C6paa	aww thats sad to think about, my children are just 6,3,2,and 5 1/2 months so I haven't experienced yet, but me and my sisters go see my mom all the time, I load up all the kids and go over there to cook, last week we bought all the kids one of those ball pits and we set it up at our moms house, we spend a whole lot of time with her, and I call her 3 to 4 times daily...I hope my kids do me like this lol|`|SnQvsOPwaa	You cry. If you did your job right they will be back to visit and to drop off their kids for a while.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	I like the once a month dinner with Mom and Dad.  The kids don't feel that they are being "spied" on or not being independent, but still feel that they are part of the family.  Also, make sure that they know they can call you anytime just to talk or say hello.|`|RsFxgN4Gaa	I miss my son all the time. I know if he could visit more, he would, but him being a marine and all he doesn't get alot of choice on when he gets time off.<br>  <br>  I don't cry over it... because I know that the reason he is out there living his life is because I succeeded at doing my job as a parent. That gives me a sense of pride, not sadness.<br>  <br>  And when I really get to missing him, I call him or text him. Other than that, I am just thankful he is out there doing something he loves and succeeding in life.|`|YW74O9aNaa	I guess its a gradual process to get mentally prepared for that.<br>  <br>  My kids are just 6 and 2. But for my first one i couldn't seperate even for a day.. i was never comfortable leaving him overnight at granparents .. going to work made me feel guilty... the second time i was much more normal :D and even my kids are becoming independent as the days go by.<br>  <br>  Once they start full time school, the distance will grow again.. they'll be out all day, will have their own social circle.. <br>  <br>  When they move out i'll surely be sad but i guess i would be mentally prepared for that by the time comes. <br>  <br>  Having hobbies and being independent will help me overcome the sadness due to seperation. <br>  <br>  I would like to get involved but won't feel bad if they don't .. I'll call then  on regular basis but not become annoying :)  I'll go visit my grandkids or offer to babysit too!<br>  <br>  If i've been a good parent they'll love me, they'll come meet me i'm sure of that! :)|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	god they never forget you ,,,, they love you ,,,, it time for you to get your life back again as they say ,,, job   new interests ,,you no what   you will have grandkids one day   ,,,  and what a pleasure that is too  ,,, but you can give them back ,, have a family dinner every now and them ,, christmas time at one one there places ,,, you will be one big family still they still can ring you ,,,   ,, all the best..|`|207dFmdHaa	I have 6 kids, 5 still at home. My oldest son is 33 and is Marine in Afghanistan. He is married, and his wife is pregnant with our first grandchild. He has been out of the house for quite awhile, with college, then the Marines, then back to the Marines. When he first went away to college, I had twin boys still at home and I worked full time so I was pretty busy, but everyday, I missed him, certain times of the day, so I set my alarm on my watch to go off at certain times of the day, just so I would think about him or call him at school. We are a very very close family so it was hard for his dad, and grandparents also. It has been hardest this time that he is in Afghanistan, he has a wife now, a baby on the way, and I miss him more than ever. I have no doubt we will always stay an active part of our kids life. If my oldest son and his wife werent family, they would be some of our closest friends. I like all my kids, and enjoy being around them. I think we have always tried to make our kids feel they are the most important things in the world to us, they know when they call me or their dad, for anything, at anytime we will take that call....I have had to take a recess in court before because my son was on the phone wanting to tell me hello....my twin boys told us not too long ago that if we died tomorrow they would know how much we loved them, because whenever they walk into a room both their dad and my eyes light up...you cant wait until they are 15 or 16 to start a relationship, it starts when they are born, and dont try and be a friend, you are their parents......good luck, hope you are as blessed as we have been, and continue to be....|`|YvJdkSNaaa	Send their children really awful gifts such as cow-print mini skirts and industrial sized bottles of super glue :) lol, jk<br>  <br>  Really though, just call as uch as you can and offer to visit or arrange for them to visit.  Try to think back to how involved your grandparents were involved in your life and how your parents have been involved in your life since you moved out.  Model after what they did if they can, and if that's not a good model, ust try talking to your kids about it.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	My mom did. She did miss us a lot. She wished that we would come see her more and she told us so we did. Ask your children to come see you more. Tell them that you are feeling lonely and that you would enjoy it if they brought their new family over so you could spend time. <br>  <br>  Another thing would to be to give them Easter Gifts, Christmas, Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, all those fun holidays. When your son/daughter and their spouse want to go out baby sit your grandchildren.<br>  <br>  My oldest is only two, but here are a few ideas.|`|1elv7oc5aa	omg, I am seriously dreading this time.  I don't even like it when my kids go stay the night somewhere and they are only 7 and 9.  I think my husband thinks i'm crazy because after they are gone for a few hours or if they have been gone all night I'm ready for them to be home.  I don' t even want my daughter to go to middle school next year.  It is so sad.  I never want them to grow up.|`|c5068603ce14825332c2f7bfb7b4b118aa	I would see if they would be up to having a dinner every other week. So that you all can get together and enjoy each others company. Offer to babysit the grand kids for them so they can get out with their spouses stuff like that. <br>  <br>  Also try to find some hobbies for yourself. This will help to get your mind off of the kids not being around all the time. like joining the local y and doing some of the activities they offer.|`|30R7gIXtaa	enjoy life<br>  your problem is you havnt replaced them with anything<br>  i am oil painting<br>  went to rome<br>  learned how to belly dance drum for belly dancers<br>  when i lose some weight i will learn to tango<br>  <br>  take it as read when your kids ring you they want something, you see them when they want a lift<br>  <br>  time to move on its a great time not a sad time|`|8Wxzz0Zraa	Trust them to never forget you. If they really love you, they won't.<br>  <br>  Call them often. Do lunch every now and then.<br>  <br>  Keep in touch.<br>  <br>  All I can say is, don't drift.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	lately i have been missing them being babies. i'm all done making babies so it's all over for me.
MXXOICquaa	my husband would put his hand right where the baby would kick and yet he would feel nothing i didnt understand it he finally can feel the baby kick sometimes but he says he cant tell if im breathing or if the baby is kicking i guess men are just retarded lol|`|fMnzjULCaa	I really don't think I skipped it, I just don't think I knew what to look for since it's my first. Maybe w/ my second I will be able to notice the fluttering. But I don't remember feeling it & I felt actual kicks at 19 weeks. Around 22 weeks I could see my stomach jump when he kicked & could feel it from the outside. 22 weeks was when I noticed it, it could've been sooner, but I didn't know to look that early! My husband hasn't felt it either. He'll put his hand there for like 2 seconds & if he doesn't feel anything, take it away. Doesn't work that way! You have to be patient!|`|xGlqXMRAaa	Yes, it happend to my sister. The baby started kicking like crazy at 19 weeks it was insane we all though she was just imagining things it wasnt until the ultrasound that we really realized how much the baby was kicking.  As far as  your husband, its hard for men to feel because they are afraid of the belly. It goes along with "im going to poke my kind in the head" syndrome, just take his hand and press it down as hard as is comfortable for you and he should be able to feel it then. Good Luck and congrats.|`|01ntBgaPaa	Congrats on the little one.<br>  <br>  I never really had the "fluttering stage". It was nothing, nothing, big kick. <br>  <br>  I find that people that know what a kick feels like can feel it. AKA the technician.<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I didnt skip the flutter stage well i kinds did at 14 weeks i could feel lil tiny kick more like a kick then a flutter...but at 20 weeks i felt hard kicks...with ur first pregnancy u might not have noticed the flutters as much as u would in ur second pregnancy!|`|hjLzSGV0aa	haha sometimes, you think the baby kicks harder than he/she actually is<br>  thats wy men sometimes cant feel it ;]<br>  <br>  naw i felt my baby kicking around 15 wks|`|xFK4Ajroaa	"with ur first pregnancy u might not have noticed the flutters as much as u would in ur second pregnancy!"<br>  <br>  I have heard before that the kicks are felt better in the second pregnancy too.<br>  <br>  However, with my first I did feel the flutters.  I guess we and our babes all have unique circumstances. :)|`|DrFkFu3daa	I was always hesitant to think that the slight movements were the baby, but they must have been because at like week 18 or 19 the baby was really letting itself be known, definitely not gas, those were kicks|`|u3sxwcPoaa	Totally normal. Congrats!
IkkYOehSaa	in different forms now. In America there is a breastmilk bank. Where women can donate breast milk. But their diets are heavily watched and the milk is very closely screened. <br>  But I am sure that other women do this. I have with a friends daughter. She wont take a bottle and the couple of times I have baby sat her I have nursed her. My friend is very okay with it and i am healthy with the ab sense of alcohol and cigarettes in my life. Her daughter needs to eat and she REFUSES the bottle. I am still breastfeeding my daughter and her is still very young, but she does know the difference between us. With me she doesn't latch on as well.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	idk but you could pump breast milk and donate it to your local hospital or other mothers who cant nurse|`|j9axB0YMaa	I don't know about an actual wet nurse but at a lot of hospitals you can donate it to the NICU and they have it pasteurized and give it to the babies. I also heard about some program where you can do the same thing but it's for women soldiers babies that have been deployed.
KEu8nqEQaa	The lab I went to let me pick up my results the night I got the blood drawn!|`|qHa4w8eyaa	Where I live, it takes 10 to 14 days at a public (government funded) clinic - but I think they are just slower than the rest.

0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	I don't know about normal, but it's definitely possible and may even prove to be less expensive than purchasing other donated sperm. You would have to do a lot of talking among the three of you and look into all avenues and the procedures you could choose from. I would recommend doing some counseling for all of you and have lots of meetings with the doctor performing the procedure. Take into account that it will be safer (genetically) for you to carry the child and not your girlfriend. Another option is to visit a sperm bank and look into already donated sperm from individuals who share certain traits with you and your girlfriend if you or the brother is worried about him forming a parental attachment or have another concern.|`|LDYAGJCxaa	Well, I don't know about normal, but if all three of you are okay with it, then I don't see anything wrong with it.  Just make sure you come to a written agreement on the role her brother will be playing in this child's life.  Will he be looked at as an uncle and only an uncle?  Will he act as a father to the child?  If so, how much time and how large of a role are you (or he) expecting as the father?  Lot's of questions, but it's best to have them all ironed out and agreed on before any further decisions are made.  Other than that, i say go for it and good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  ETA:  This is all provided you're in a healthy and stable relationship.  :)|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	If you can work it out legally and you are all 3 ok with it it's your lives if that makes you happy go right ahead.

And your girlfriend can really feel connected, because they wiiiill share some DNA :) How awesome! <br>  Yea, you can do that. <br>  Make sure he signs over his parental rights though immediately, wouldn't want any drama going down with that later.. Have him donate his sperm to you, you can go to a doctor (fertility specialist) and they can figure it all out for you, and implant his little swimmers into you.|`|AA12067543	you know i think i saw somethin kinda like this on the L word a few yrs ago
2i53Vdiwaa	How about having your own American idol night. You could either rent out a hall and a dj or fix up the basement/garage or whatever space you can find and set it up with a stage and music etc.. <br>  Have a few of her/your friends to play the part of judges.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	Its to long i dont want to answer, but thanks for the 2 points =)|`|e3i7FWw9aa	too lonq. didnt wanna read it. but at least i answeres =]|`|Ly20pGC9aa	a boat party would be toattly rad. im fourteen and my friends had a toattly amazing double birthday party on a party boat on the lake. we hung out, danced, had a great dj on board, even cooked out and jumped on and off the boat and with the slide, tooks pictures, about fifty people it was a ball. and it was for three hours, guys and girls, and party boats arent even that expensive!<br>  hope it helps!|`|u3sw0LMpaa	Hello... I'm 14 and from my perspective, every teenage girl wants something Jonas brothers related!!! Their movie is coming out this weekend, you should have a get together for her and her friends to go watch it.. They also make surprise appearances at theaters all across the nation to watch the movie with their fans!!! =) Peace on Earth =)|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Have a slumber party, invite about 6 good friends (her friends).  Buy the best junk food ever, like ice cream, pizza, nachos, etc.  Rent some scary or funny movies.  Tell ghost stories.  Get some makeup and hair stuff and do makeovers.  <br>  <br>  This was my best birthday party ever, I was 14.  I'm 27 now and have to say that was the best!|`|G0wXt0mlaa	Ask her what she wants to do. Set up a bunch of stuff to do and have her invite friends. Easy.<br>  <br>  Like, rent some movies, get the pool ready, etc. Trampolines too =D<br>  <br>  At least this stuff always works at  boys parties|`|l9iLpBkIaa	What does she like to do?<br>  <br>  I would ask her what her favorite thing is and make a party theme around that.<br>  <br>  Otherwise just remember that it's not where you have the party, it's who you invite. Make sure you get her best friends and have a really good time.|`|YYJ2SlKbaa	Slumber party|`|bH6KUo3jaa	umm..IDK LOL!|`|LoIhwvo9aa	shopping spree party...get some her and s few of her closest friends and take her to the mall and give her like a prepaid $150 credit card and give each of her friends like a prepaid $50 dollar credit cards and take em places and then take em out for ice cream or a meal at like cheesecake factory or something whatever they want and end it with a slumber party..its perfect!|`|PqUXnWZGaa	Hi, I'm 14 and i know my really cool b-day party was going to an amusement park with my best friends and family and just hanging out with them! It was a lot of fun, we had the b-day cake just outside the amusement where  they have picnic tables, i really enjoyed it! <br>  <br>  Try something like this, or try going to a carnival, or holding a cool party in your backyard, full of decorations, things that teens love to do: like dancing, having fun competitions with one another.... Or try hanging by the pool and play games in there like volley ball or something...<br>  <br>  Hope i helped|`|QNwv4Efdaa	Ok. If i were having a party( and im 13 ) I would have to go with something like a weekend party. Like having a weekend sleepover. sleepover at your house friday night then saturday night. On the first day do fun things like going bowling( i no that sounds childish) but it is tuns of fun!:) Then go to the mall or something for a couple hours have like a late lunch, then go see a movie or something. come back later on, then have some pizza or something for supper. Then before you know it the day is gone already. Then on the second day ( sunday ) you should just chill out at your place open presents ( optional. could have done that yesterday after supper). maybe you could go out for supper to like a fancy restaurant with your family and maybe friends and then your friends could be gone by the latest 10:00 pm. Ive done that and it is a blast its like two back to back birthday parties! it rocks! I really hope that you use my idea . xxx its tuns of fun especially for a teen. god bless you.|`|eO1G3s1Zaa	Heeyy i know how you fellll.......i am having a 13th birthday party tomorrow and i am having an all nighter hotel party.......but a really good idea is to find a place where there really are nooo rulez... and try to play dare like make people un around the hotel talk to attendants and be really creative....maybe have a murder mystery party they are a ton of funnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  i love parties and party pplanning but after many reallly good parties it gets harder to find an idea... like a murder mystery party could be a lot of funn like maybe pretend you as the sister is poisined and all the guests try to find clues of who did it and then it will end up being one of the guests or something.....again be creative!!!!!!!!!!!!  i hope this helped at least a little|`|7QwgAhntaa	You're like 14...shouldn't you be watching zoey 101 or something?|`|S5l6A8z8aa	my girl is growing up...<br>  <br>  i don't know...<br>  <br>  where should be go next?|`|5ee0276421a3bea7ae0be05f1a356457aa	i like the idea of using a theme... but not in a dorky way like you would for little kids. what does your sister like to do? for example if she likes animals, maybe you could plan an afternoon that includes meeting up at the aquarium (if you have one where you live) or the zoo, and then go to her favorite restaurant later in the evening - and people could join the party at any point... any little favors or cool trinkets or decorations you get to add some personalization to the party could also take on the 'animal' theme. you could end up at your house or a hotel later - and play either her favorite music, or music that would fit the theme (i'm sure there are tons of 'party animal' songs out there that would fit the animal theme, for example)... there could be dancing, and hanging out, a cake of course!!!<br>  <br>  if you're able to go all out, you could rent a hall at a hotel, get a DJ and do a dance party - play music loud like they would at a school dance (except cooler because it's only her friends there or whatever), you could go with a caterer or do it potluck to save money. have people sign up to bring her favorite foods (make a list and include recipes for things she likes, so it's better than junk food, but still her favorite stuff).<br>  <br>  ooh this would be cool - what about setting up the day just to pamper her? you could start the day off at a day spa (there's a korean spa near me where you pay something like $25 to get in and use the facility - they have different temperature pools you can use, heated rooms, a sauna, and a steam room... you can also purchase extra services, like a massage, a body scrub, or a moisturizing treatment, a facial... whatever. they offer a discount rate for groups, i think. see if you can find something like that to kick off the afternoon, and invite a dozen of her best girl friends... then you could book appointments for manicures & pedicures.. maybe followed by a night out at a rock show where she can show off her glowing skin & perfect manicure. is there anything good playing in town that night?|`|7PpjxfZ9aa	okay i don't know if this will help but for my 14th birthday party i actually had a dance at my own house with baloons, a disco ball, a strobe light, neon lights and awesome music. It's something i really enjoyed. i got to dress up and put on my best clothes and dance and act crazy with my friends! at 14 you really don't expect everything to be perfect....now when a girl turns 16...that's when you have to go all out! what's better than a girl having an awesome birthday party for her sweet 16?|`|OGDkzvgdaa	The most important thing is to do what she likes. for my 11th, I did a Harry Potter birthday party because I love it. It also depends on the month, if its the summer, try a pool party, even if its fall or spring, try an indoor pool. If there's a lot of people coming, try lazer tag, or ice skating, if there's a small group, try a concert of her fav artist. If you do do ice skating or lazer tag, there's usually a room off to a side in the building where you can decorate for a party, just remember that its her big day and try toincorporatee what she likes. <br>              Best of Luck!
NkjAqQWBaa	No. Think about all those poor woman who were raped, and ended up getting pregnant because of it.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	nope|`|NWv9hOFYaa	Thank God noooo! As I'm TTC I can't recall having orgasms on those days because I'm too busy thinking of the baby LOL.|`|cWuumdy7aa	orgasm has nothing to do with pregnancy. you can have as many children and still never had orgasm while the reverse is also true.|`|kUCVLuTPaa	that's how i gott pregnant because it is said that orgasms make you dilate and your cervix will be open..so it will take mainly all the the semen|`|nzGdMWbZaa	I dont think it is neccessary.  I am sending baby dust your way:)|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	No.|`|AaxIZSTwaa	It is not necessary, but it has been said to help the sperm move along. But as long as the man ejaculates, then there is a chance of becoming pregnant! Good luck.|`|hrint4g1aa	No, not at all, but it does help if a woman orgasms because it creates a pulsing/suction kind of an effect and can help the sperm along their way!|`|zEXzwJ0Naa	not neccessary but heard it helps alot. heard when you orgasm, it open up and sucks the sperm in more farther.|`|4iXL4C6paa	nope|`|4mSpN3Rxaa	ha ha sadly no|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Nope!|`|KlKomVgPaa	not really but it helps sperm to move fast .|`|ETL9hDIBaa	It is NOT necessary, but it doesn't hurt.  When a woman has an orgasm, the muscles contracting help guide the sperm to where it needs to go.  However, with out the constriction that the muscles give, it is still very possible.
lSiv5PDlaa	i wouldnt recommend it your little one just may come out in a pile of poo, i know it happend to me, my mom drank it...<br>  id assume take a few small doses would be a safe starting point, wait a while, if no results a little more, just be super careful!<br>  though i dont recommend it...|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	No time at all. Honestly castor oil does nothing for you except bring on bad diarrhea and horrible stomach cramping and for baby it'll make your child have their first BM inside. Trust me that is something you do not want to experience. It happened to me and I caution all women who say they want to try it. I didn't see my daughter for 2 1/2 hours AFTER I had her because she had a BM and the doctors wanted to make sure she didn't inhale any in. So those hours I could have spent cradling and cuddling her, were spent in the NICU. Don't go that route.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	is this a trick question?<br>  <br>  ZERO.|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	Don't do it. All it will do is cause you to have horrible cramps and diarrhea. If you do happen to cramp yourself into labor, think of the mess you might have on the delivery table. 90% of women poop while pushing out their baby anyway, imagine what that will be like if you have diarrhea. Plus diarrhea can dehydrate you and make you very weak for labor. It is also controversial bc some experts think that it passes to the baby and can cause them to have a bowel movement in the womb and that can be dangerous. Your baby will know when it is time to come. Don't rush it. When the baby's lungs are developed they secrete hormone, telling the mother's body to produce Oxytocin. Which starts contractions and brings on labor. Inducing before that takes the chance that your baby's lungs are not developed enough for birth. I know you are anxious but hang in there.|`|I814g6ZBaa	Mix 4 T. of castor oil in a lg. glass of OJ with 1 t. baking soda.<br>  Wait 90 minutes.<br>  Can repeat 3x.<br>  **It won't work if you aren't ready.  Are you thinned?  What is your dilation?**<br>  <br>  Good luck, Sweetie!!!|`|AA11348933	This is really something you need to discuss in close collaboration with your doctor or midwife.  They should know if you are taking castor oil and would be better at giving you a good dose to take.|`|yKS2UI87aa	You shouldn't do it.|`|h1AIzD9baa	Opinions on how to use castor oil vary. Most midwives recommend using 2 ounces. You will likely want to mix it with something to make it taste more palatable. Castor oil has an unpleasant oily taste. If you use castor oil, you may want to try one of the following recipes.<br>  <br>  Castor oil recipes<br>  Castor oil and orange juice<br>  2 oz castor oil<br>  1 tsp baking soda<br>  6 oz orange juice<br>  <br>  Castor oil milk shake<br>  2 oz castor oil<br>  2 or 2 scoops ice cream<br>  1/4 cup milk<br>  blend in blender<br>  <br>  Castor oil shots<br>  2 oz castor oil shot followed by sucking on a lime or lemon<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  BUT YOU SHOULD CONSULT WITH YOUR DOCTOR OR MIDWIFE BEFORE USING CASTER OIL TO INDUCE!! THEY NEED TO KNOW!!|`|HLlIKDWkaa	They talked about this on the show "The Dr's" a couple weeks ago and they said it doesn't do any good unless you ar in early labor. They said sex helps because semen (which contains prostaglandins) can stimulate contractions. Also nipple stimulation because the stimulation brings about the release of oxytocin, which is the natural form of pitocin. Oxytocin causes contractions, which sometimes evolve into labor. And of course Walking. But if you are set on trying castor oil I read you can take 1 to 4 ounces of castor oil mixed with 6 ounces of orange juice to cut its oiliness. You'll want to drink it quickly because of the unpleasant taste.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm gettin a thumbs down?!?! I got all my info from professionals!! Are you downers pros? I doubt it.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I drank 2 medium cups of caster oil and orange juice(half and half) when I was 39 wks with my now 1 year old. And I had a healthy baby boy 8 hours. It tastes horrible yes and i had to keep running to the bathroom for an hour or so. But it also brought on my contractions pretty fast and got my labor going without drugs. I have 4 kids and have used it everytime except for the first. I dont like epi's or the pain meds. So thats my way of getting it done and over with quick. I had no complications and neither did any of my babies!<br>          <br>    Thanks in advance for giving me a thumbs down for sharing my experience with caster oil. It's clear that anyone who supports the use of casteroil will get constant thumbs down. 2 those of u who are so against something you have never tried remember one thing. Everything you read isnt always true. Some research and medical studies never happen. They make stuff up according to their own feelings and beliefs. I'd rather listen to someone who has actually experienced it than listen to someone who hasnt and feels its horrible because they listened to word of mouth!|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	I drank 3 tbsp and ended up throwing it back up, and then took more but trust me even if it comes back up you don't need to take more once it's in your system it's gonna work, make sure you give it at least 3 hrs to get the contractions going strong.|`|06iOhuHWaa	youre not at all. it tastes TERRIBLE. and the most that will happen is you getting the sh!ts.<br>   dont do it. get a pedicure :) relaxing and it threw me into labor (theres a pressure point in your calf)<br>  <br>  google "accupressure" theres a few that can help with inducing labor|`|u3sxwcPoaa	I wouldn't do it at all. Everyone I know that has tried it has gotten really bad diarrhea and not had their babies.<br>  Let your LO come on his/her own. Your midwife or doctor should be watching you if you're over due and will have the best answer.|`|7fPuUT3Daa	Man i would read more on that, it can cause alot of problems. They will come when ready or doctor would induce you. Dont rush it i know its get BAD at the end. But dont hurt yourself or the baby|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	You need to contact a professional to ask this question. :)<br>  <br>  Drinking Castor Oil will also give you diarrhea, which can cause you to have the baby early in some women and can cause severe dehydration in some other women. I don't think that that's something you should be trusting with opinions.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|AAmsHuy1aa	I would check with your doctor 1st...but for me I was 2 days before my due date, and sooo big with my 2nd child, I took it!!  I only took half a dose and I didn't get sick like alot do.  Your body will tell you when your getting close...(example...loosing your mucus plug)  Good luck with it!!  Oh btw you can find it at walmart.  Really easy to find in the 'laxative' section.  :)|`|g2elB8eDaa	I mixxed 2 tablespoons of caster oil with cranberry juice at 5 pm then again at 630 pm. I was in labor and on my way to the hospital 6 hours later and had my little girl soon after. <br>  It works for some but not for others. Good Luck
AOvtRBU9aa	If this happened to me, I would run away. I would change my phone number and move to another state. I would start off fresh and try my best to run from them. There is no way in hell am I going to let a druggie take my baby for the weekend. It's just not going to happen. He will never be able to find you.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	When you file for child support, you can discuss custody options. His family will absolutely not be able to take your baby away from you *unless* you are a proven drug addict or have some other serious issues. Otherwise, there's no way a court would take a child from its mother. <br>  <br>  File for child support when your baby is born. Your ex will have to take a blood test, and then he will have to start paying you money (if he ever works). You can fight for 100% custody, but I can almost guarantee you he won't even try to come around and see this child. You probably don't even have to worry about that.|`|gjteVB2Daa	First and foremost...Do NOT put his name on the birth certificate as the father.  Leave the father space blank or "unknown".  Do you want financial aid from him or his family?  It would seem unwise to do that.  Just keep them out of the picture entirely.  If you do go to court to get him to pay support, you will be admitting he is the father; and if it were me that is the last thing I would do.  If you do want to keep your baby, plan ahead and get into a support group.  You might check with legal aid in your city for more advice and then take it.  Further, do not speak or have anything to do with the ex and his family.  Avoid them, do not return calls, etc.  If you are a minor, enlist your parents support and understanding.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	They can order a DNA test, so you can't really keep them from doing that. But, they can't just take the baby away, the courts don't work like that. If you explain his drug problems and his verbal abuse, he would likely only be able to get supervised visits *if* even that.  And he'd have to pay child support. <br>  <br>  Legally, they don't seem to understand the court system if they're saying idiotic stuff like they're going to take the baby away.<br>  <br>  Edit: And yes, record all conversations with them.|`|k5X78IM3aa	Go to the magistrate & get a restraining order to keep him away from you & from you & the baby when it is born.  From what you have said you shouldn't have any trouble...especially with his drug problem.  This will not cost you anything.|`|soFpywFcaa	get a lawyer tell him your situation and find out what are your best options just go to a free consultation ...........................i would say put them in court and prove why he is not a stable father|`|u94HOVz7aa	when that baby is born the only one that has rights to your baby is you.  the father has no rights till he file for them and you two go to court.  the family has Absolutely no rights to the baby and can not require you to take a dna test and they will not be able to take the baby from you.  the only person that can require a dna test is the alleged father.  the hospital wouldn't even let my hubby (not legally married anymore long story) have any say about what happened with my son.  they wouldn't even hand him any paperwork about the baby because we were not married.  they told him he doesn't have any legal rights at that time.  avoid contact with his family.  if he wants to talk to you i might try to be civil, but if he gets mean Again just tell him that you will contact him when the baby is born, but until then not to contact you.|`|xzMkUCizaa	File a restraining order. Once you put the restraining order they will have on file the reasons and once the baby is born he obviously has to stay away from you thus the baby( for a while at least) then again file a restraining order on behalf of your child and get a lawyer because you will need to go to court.|`|JSFCkne8aa	Its not just your baby, its BOTH of you baby.  If the paternity test shows he is the father then he deserves to see his child.  If it were a perfect world  you wouldn't be spreading your legs for someone who you didn't want to be your childs father.  He might be right...you're might be a  wh0re.|`|GBHVkElWaa	You are the mother. No one can take your baby away so don't let his family scare you. I don't even think they can force you to take a DNA test so don't agree to anything unless it is court mandated or something.|`|4iXL4C6paa	While you are pregnant avoid contact with him so you dont get stressed, if they keep bothering you make sure to record calls, keep all messages, just basically document everything and if they do try anything you will have proof he is unfit.|`|N9UaUMBkaa	hire a good lawyer then ask the lawyer to hire a good private detective. then call narcotics and report his drug use|`|9fea2a31ad2061394c0ccf90e32f204baa	First of all how old are you? Secondly why was he alright enough to have sex with and stay with until he dumped you a month ago then suddenly he is a horrible drug adict? You need to grow up. You had no right or business to lie about the fact that he is the father of the child because guess what father's have as much rights as mothers do. Having said all that you need to realize it isn't about you and your hurt feelings or your pride it is about this new person. You need to grow up and decide to put his/her feelings and needs above your own. Work out an arrangement you can both live with and get legal papers drawn up saying who gets the baby and for how long. Most judges will not take an infant for over night trips until the baby is closer to a year old esp. if you choose to only breast feed. In that time if the father is really the loser you claim he is he may lose interest and walk away on his own.|`|HeLrqYMgaa	Speak with someone at a resource center (you can usually find one through the YWCA or even a local school).  Find out what the options are in your area. You can get help with legal aid if you need it. Do not hold back any information about him. Be willing to give him supervised visitation... but explain that you do not trust his parenting abilities and why. You will have carried the baby for 9 months without his support and him and his family fighting you the whole way... that is already a plus for you.   Good luck!  Keep fighting... but don't let it stress you out too much!|`|mFEevGRXaa	its sad that you have to deal with this before your baby is even born, but then once it is it will be up to the courts. and honestly from what i can tell you will have no problem taking him to court and winning.  or you could look at it like this.... maybe he will come around and you will work things out before the baby comes. GOOD LUCK AND TAKE CARE!|`|EdJ8FkOmaa	well,<br>  record ALL messages and contact <br>  try to finda lawyer.<br>  and how old r u?|`|bBP1Xlnkaa	You're going to need a lawyer. This could be pretty messy, but from what I understand a baby isn't taken away from his/her mother too often and it sounds as though he isn't the best father. Your lawyer can help you out and fight for your rights and the babies rights. Make sure you let the lawyer know about the father's drug use and lack of a job. If you don't know where to start you can try contacting the United Way and start there. They might be able to head you in the right direction. Good luck to you. It sounds like it will be a bumpy road ahead.
