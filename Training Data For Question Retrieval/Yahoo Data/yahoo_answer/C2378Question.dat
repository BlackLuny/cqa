20090226195447AAJjbsl	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Essay Question!?! Please HELP!!! (Anne Frank essay)?	Ok basically we have to write a persuasive essay on The Diary of Anne Frank. The topic is: Would you invite the Van Daans in with you if you were in hiding? I have typed my essay below (i'm not a very good writer). Please read it and let me know if there is anything wrong with it. Thanks!                               Would you welcome another family into your home during tough economic times? I surely would not. The Franks on the other hand, did. Their welcoming hearts turned out a disadvantage for them.                         Mr. Van Daan was invited into the Franks home as a guest but yet he felt in need of more. Mr. Van Daan stole food from the safe while the others slept with hungry stomachs. He was selfsih, greedy, and bad. The right thing for him to do would have been to sacrifice like evryone else.                      Secondly, Mr. Van Daan argued with Anne Frank. If someone were to argue with my child I would kick them out immediately. Mr. Van Daan should have been kind to Anne and the rest of the Franks because he was staying at their home.                                 Lastly, Mrs. Van Daan out Anne down when she accidentally spilled milk on her coat. What Mrs. Van Daan did was wrong because it was cruel. Anne didn't do it on purpose yet Mrs. Van Daan made it seem as if she did.                                     On the other hand you might be thinking that because Peter and Anne were such good and close friends, the Van Daans should stay. I strongly disagree because Peter could of been faking it. He might of known that they were going to get kicked out if he wasn't so close with Anne.                                 In conclusion, I believe that the Franks should have never allowed the Van Daans to live with them. What Mr. Frank did was selfless but the Van Daans did not deserve such kind-hearted treatment.

I gotta decide quick because most of the application deadlines are in March.       I've done several productive things the past summers.       9th grade summer- Youth leader at youth center by provinding tutoring and mentorship to kids (still involved). I also attended a leadership camp.    10th grade summer- Studied business and leadership at UCLA and took a Math class at community college       11th grade???       Ok, so I'm a junior and I want to experience college life this summer while studying for the SAT. In other words, I want to stay at the dorms and take an SAT prep course at a college. HOWEVER, I would also like to do something "fun" and I am encountering a problem.       I am currently taking Statistics for Math because I did not feel prepared for Pre-Calculus. Would it be a good idea to take Algebra 2 again for review, but at a community college?       Other ideas- I like neurology, crime scene investigations, screenwriting, journalism, volunteer at hospital, law and would LOVE to travel to Europe.       HELP!!!! Do you know of any names or what I should do??????

20090226202935AAONOWw	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	(Lawyer)What subjects should I take before going to law school for those 4 years.?	Formal requirements to become a lawyer usually include a 4-year college degree, 3 years of law school, and passing a written bar examination; however, some requirements may vary by State.      Although there is no recommended “prelaw” undergraduate major, prospective lawyers should develop proficiency in writing and speaking, reading, researching, analyzing, and thinking logically—skills needed to succeed both in law school and in the law. Regardless of major, a multidisciplinary background is recommended. Courses in English, foreign languages, public speaking, government, philosophy, history, economics, mathematics, and computer science, among others, are useful.          http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos053.htm

20090226212009AANpSyO	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	If you were a transfer admissions adviser what would you have to say about such an email?	Hello, my name is _______.   I was a student at NEU from Fall 2007 until the end of fall 2008.  I transferred from the school for a number of reasons, chiefly being that I was not happy at all my final semester and it made no sense to go to a school far off from home (I am from Wisconsin originally) and pay out of state costs for a college that I wasn't happy at.  However, transferring just served to exacerbate the unhappiness at NEU into what I've had classified as moderately severe depression.      After being on the deans list 3 consecutive semesters at NEU with a QPA of 3.572 over 53 semester hours, being busy in the pep, concert, and jazz bands, aikido, and judo, I made the transfer to _____.  Up until I finally got help, I no longer cared about my classes here, frequently skipping them simply because I saw no reason to go.  My grades have been dropping, and though I'm finally getting help and am slowly rehabilitating myself I am concerned about my grades this semester.   This is a problem because I've realized I wish to transfer BACK to NEU...  however I'm unsure what making such an attempt would entail, and I thought I would write to ask your advice on prepping for such a transfer.        For my anthropology and special topics in physics class, I'm fairly confident I can bring my grades up to a B.  My Organic Chemistry class I may be able to bring it up to a B, but realistically I'm looking at a B-/C+.  My biology class I'm uncertain if I can even get a C in.      What, if even possible should my next steps be to try to make it back?  I miss the city, I miss playing with the pep band/hanging out in the dog house over hockey, I miss the friends I accumulated over my time there, and I sorely regret transferring.  What can I do?      Thank you for your time,   _______________         I intend to send this letter to the transfer adviser at NEU... for the reasons above.  What can I do to make this better?

20090226204037AA3UAbE	Education & Reference;Homework Help	How come high school never teach you about life?	I had maybe two teachers that I really respected, they taught me life lessons which is not part of the course description but did so anyway.  Same with one of my professors.    So now I am asking, why isn't high school practical enough?  They never teach you to be realistic, telll you when it is okay to lie, never teach you street smarts, never teach you how to survive social situations (on a mental scale, they just tell you tattle to the teacher, and usually, in my opinoin that makes it worse).  They never teach you how to be emotionally strong, never teach you about having decent levels of self esteem, never teach you to be yourself, never comfort you, never teach you how to socialize, never teach you how to act, and be respectful (they just tell you so and expect you to know that sort of stuff).   Never teach you to manage your time, never teach you to organize things, never teach you to be real, never teach you to multi task.          And worse of all, they never teach you to learn to be not so vain.
20090225122114AAELcrK	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	What High School Classes should I take?	I'm not very good in math, and i'm not sure what I'm going to do with my life. Not many people do when they are in 8th grade. I've already taken Spanish 1, and I'm thinking about Japanese classes, because I love the culture and the language and people. Would Spanish 1, and Japanese 1,2,3, and 4 look good on a resume for college?   I don't know what I want to do with my life.   I like making music, movies, acting, writing, and I'm extreamly good at computers, but not at math so much.   Should I take a little bit of everything?
20090226204448AAIBsHk	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How can I possibly get into Stanford!?	I have a    3.67 GPA (unweighted)   4.01 GPA (weighted)   1670 SAT score    SAT II:   Math II: 630   Biology: 600   US History: 570   Extra curriculars: Mathletes treasurer, fencing treasurer, CSF, youth group at church, visiting elderly home   That's it.   I had two of my teachers look over my essay, they both said it was good (both are english teachers). I haven't seen my recommendation letters, but I'm pretty sure they are good.       The think is, though...a guy at my school got rejected for early admissions and he has perfect grades and scores. He has a 4.0 GPA, and a 4.6 weighted. He is in many clubs and is involved in the comunity, I don't know what his essay is like, but how is it that someone who has never gotten a B get rejected? Does that leave any hope for me? I'm of a minority and low-income.    Please be honest, I want the truth, not a padded, "you'll do fine" speech, I've gotten enough of those, and they don't help.   Thanks for your answers.

20090226210621AACgZlm	Education & Reference;Financial Aid	Will changing my major affect my fin aid?	Ok here is the deal. I am going to a community college so when I picked my major(chemical  dependancy specialization) I did not need a whole lot of basics. I just needed comp 1 and 2 and 1 math class. So I jumped right into the other classes. Well I am in my 3 semester and I want to change majors. I had originally wanted to be a registered nurse but I heard all these horror stories about how the students practice on each other. But now I dont even care, I know that I want to be a nurse no matter what. Anyways my question is can I change my major and still receive my fin aid? I feel like I wasted all that money on the other classes and am afraid that I will not be able to receive anymore if I switch. I know every school is different, but just in general have you heard of this or anything like it? Thank so much
20090225122114AAl1fBq	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Vlook up not working correctly, Why?	I have an excel spreadsheet with a reference number in one column (on say, Sheet X). In another sheet (sheet Y for reference sake) I have the same reference numbers but also additional info such as short text, etc. When I go to do a vlookup to import in this short text into sheet X, excel tells me 'N/A' for every line. That is, until I double click into the reference number on sheet X and then simply press enter, at which point it right aligns the value within the column and decides that it can now find this value in the other sheet, despite the value not actually changing.      Anyone know why this happens and if there's an easy fix? Have a couple of hundred of lines to otherwise 'double-click and then enter on' just to make it recognise the text properly. Also happens quite a few times it seems, not the first time it's happened and on different machines.

20090225122859AAaqnRu	Education & Reference;Teaching	Are teachers aloud to tell you to follow them if you are in the hallway? Do you think this guy was a teacher?	This question is mainly for teachers, substitutes, ect. But if you are other wise and would like to give your opinion, then thats fine.      Are teachers aloud to just tell a student in the hallway to follow them? This is what happened to me and my bff today. Okay so we're both in 8th grade, and we have the same classes, so we walk together. And then there was a guy behind us who didnt look very familiar. He could have passed as a teacher, but my school requires all teachers to where a little id card thing around there necks, like you see people we're at wal-mart or something. But this guy wasn't wearing one, and he walked up to me and my friend and told us that we had to go with him, and i asked why, and hes like don't worry about it, and so i followed him until he started walking towards the exit that just led to the parking lot of the school, but my friend kept walking so i pulled her back and told her i didnt think it was a teacher, and i literally had to yank her down the hallway, and now shes mad at me, and won't talk to me because she thinks that tomorrow we're going to get in trouble for ditching, and she claims it was all my fault.      But anyways we just barely made it to class. So can you guys answer the first question, and then i have two more. In your opinion, do you think it is possible to get in trouble tomorrow for not following him, if he was a teacher? And do you think that this guy was a teacher?

20090225122828AAzgSZK	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Where should I go to school?  People from Miami University of Ohio or University of Georgia please?	I'm currently a sophomore in college at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. My first year here was close to horrible. Unlike huge party schools (such as Delaware), you have to know people to get into the frats, so you can’t just go out on campus whenever you feel like it. This school is small, and the hierarchy socially here is hard to get into, unless I make the sports team I am trying out for. 70% guys, 30% girls, half those girls I don’t really find attractive.  Anybody who went to high school knows your social position in any hierarchy affects your potential with women. I'm trying to really make my experience better here because I don’t ant to have to leave and start over, but if I'm not leaving anything, then I probably should leave. I have applied to the UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA, and I am thinking about applying possibly to DELAWARE (b/c my friends are there). I was also thinking MIAMI OF OHIO UNIVERSITY. I need feedback on what those schools are like, SOCIALLY, imp pretty sure at bigger schools girls are more concerned with just dating around with anyone rather than social status, which is harder to set up at big schools. I just need to know what the people there are like, mainly WHAT THE WEEKEND SCENE IS LIKE. What do you guys do on the weekends, how accessible are parties even if you aren’t that connected, and just in general is it easy to find friends and are there lots of things to go do. I really need to know, if I go to one of these schools, will I live the college experience socially or will I be on the outside because I'm not on a sports team or in a fraternity.      I know this is long but feedback from alumni or current students at these schools would be appreciated.

So my freshmen year of college was.... bad. I had a lot of stuff going on, mainly involving my dad having several surgeries and a heart attack, and I had a suicidal friend. Needless to say, I did not do well academically. My second semester, I became very depressed and I wanted to withdraw from my classes. Now, an advisor told me if I withdrew at that point, I would not be charged and I would not get a grade. If I came back the next semester, I wouldn't lose my pell grant. However, she saw on my account that I still owed the school money (from that very semester.....?) because I also worked to pay off what the pell grant did not cover. She said in order to withdraw, I would have to have a balance of zero. (I found out later this was NOT true). By the time I paid the school back, it was too late, and I was given failing grades. I saw another advisor, explained I was having problems, and I was told to "see a counselor to cope."       Having taken that semester off, things got better and I intended to return to school, more mentally healthy this time. Until I received a letter saying since I had failed all my courses (which I had tried to WITHDRAW from) that I had to repay my pell grant.       Now, all of this happened a year and a half ago. I can't get back into college because I still owe that university money, and I have no way to pay them back. Only recently did I find out that if you have a family illness that you can fight such things. Is it too late to do this? Also, is there any way I could take out a student loan to cover the pell grant, then work my GPA back up in school? I do not qualify for a regular loan. Not bad credit, just don't have .... any credit. No, my parents can't help me repay the school. My mom doesn't make enough and my father passed away from all his medical problems last year. Please someone give me a good answer, I want to get back into college so badly. And no one say to go talk to the advisers, they're the ones that told me things that weren't true to begin with. At this point I don't trust them.

Should I take kinesiology (musculoskeletal Function and Human Performance 1&2) or Biology (Anatomy & Physiology 1&2)?      Here is my situation. I am a exercise science major here at my university. After i get my B.A in Exercise Science I would like to apply for physical therapy school. My university does have a graduate program where you can earn a DPT in Physical Therapy. The thing is if you are currently enrolled in the university that I am in, and are an exercise science major then you have a slight advantage in applying to the DPT program. If you do not want to take Biology (Human Anatomy and Physiology 1&2) you can take Kinesiology (Musculoskeletal Function and Human Performance 1&2) instead. I want to apply to my university's DPT program but I know I want to apply to other places as well just in case I don't get in somewhere. When I look at other university requirements for the DPT program the say you have to have taken Biology....       With this being said, do you think I should take the Biology Courses or the Kinesiology courses? I do plan to apply to 4 or 5 schools include my university's physical therapy school.       Also if anyone has taken any of these courses, are they hard? Which one is easier? Which one is more interesting.      Please help

20090226162521AAXFhK6	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	Can someone check my practice SAT Essay?	Even though the world's economy is gradually decreasing, private college costs are off the roof and the college dropout rate is increasing at a disappointing rate, a students needs should be considered before his/her merits. Not every student chooses to go into the medicine field, or the engineering field, but he/she chooses to go towards his/her dream. Even the smallest of change can have a huge impact.   The current world's economy is at a staggering development. The rich are getting richer, and the poorer are getting no where. Bright and intelligent students may take birth into a rich, poor or a middle class family. No one controls the circle of birth and death. Some children, who are born in the slums of a detoriating enviornment, seem to be the brightest minds present in our world. An average student should not be turned down for scholarships just because of his/her academic standing, they should be given a chance to show their change.    Because of the global economy problems, attending college is only getting much more expensive. Students who choose to pursue their dreams are getting held back by not being able to afford college. Not only because of the high student interest loans, but also because of the government not investing enough money in the education department causes the students to pursue a "$7/hour" job, and wind themselves working in that "part-time job" for over two decades. Students who come from middle or poor class homes finish high school hoping to make a difference in the world, but their dreams are crushed when they find out they won't be able to afford the tuition.   When students are rewarded on something they worked hard for, the reward, no matter how big or small, encourages them to pursue on further. They want to gain their status, earn more rewards, and work hard. A great man also once said, "If its not worth fighting for, its not worth gaining". Students push themselves to a whole new level. College dropout rates are high, not because of the work, but because of the weak effort inputed by the student itself. Students who want to succeed can and will succeed, but students who find themselves in situations where they aren't happy, dropout.   Having support is what students all over the world need, they understand the bad economy, and this is exactly why they should be given an oppurtunity, to make a difference. Federal Loans can allow the students to pursue their dreams, and to improve the world.      Excerpt:   With the rising cost of education in the form of college tuition,    training courses and vocational programs, the competition for    scholarships and financial aid is rapidly increasing. Many college    financial aid offices are assisting students from historically high    income brackets. Furthermore, scholarship programs are seeing    unprecedented levels of interested applicants. The challenge    facing these institutions is whether to award aid based on how    accomplished the applicant is or how difficult it will be for the    student to afford the education.      Assignment:   Is it better to financially reward individuals like students and    employees based on how much merit the individual demonstrates    instead of how much need the individual has? Plan and write an    essay in which you develop your point of view on this issue. Support    your position with reasoning and examples taken from your reading,    studies, experience, or observations.

20090226164829AAAcjQt	Education & Reference;Special Education	Help for my autistic son?	My now ex-wife used domestic violence as a divorce tactic and the local family law court, in their typical efforts to aid the mother by victimizing the father, have stripped my visitation down to nearly nothing so that percentage-wise I am being forced to pay her a lot of money even though she makes more than me.      But that's not my point.  My point is that I have nearly no contact with my children anymore thanks to these same pigs.      Aside from my own troubles, my children are suffering from this as well.  My daughter (10 years old) who does NOT have a learning disability is apparently good enough to have to be counseled every week by one of the avaristic court therapists.      However, her older brother (12 years old) who is autistic apparently is actual WORK for the therapists who are ignoring him (not that he is not used to that from his school teachers as well).      He is having a lot of issues and really needs help.  Since the law is keeping me from being his dad, I want someone else to try to help him.  However, noone will listen to me and the court and its therapists appear to be completely focused on my daughter.  (They make me sick.)      Is there some place I can turn to for help for my son?  Has anyone else gone through this sort of thing?

20090226212047AACi844	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Please read this essay and rate it and tell me what I can write to improve it. giving 10 points?	Life today is easier and more comfortable than it was when our grandparents where children      Reading this topic, I would have to agree that it has become easier now. Since sixty years ago, better technology has been created, better studies have been made, better discoveries, and of course for certain people racism has decreased. Of course if you get an older person’s opinion they might say their time was easier, simpler and classier. I personally think that since 60 years ago some good changes have come and some bad changes have come. Some examples of good changes are that racism has decreased better discoveries have been made. Other bad changes for example are more wars.    Since grandparents time technology has changed a lot and improved. There are now cell-phones to call someone in case of an emergency. There’s the Internet to be able to find your research and studies faster. There’s GPS to find a lost someone or location. All these new technologies are very helpful to us and make life ore simple for us as opposed to sixty years ago when we had to find a pay phone, or read lots of books or use the old fashion stay-where-you-are-if-you-get-lost technique.    Many other good things have come since then. There have been cures found for diseases like Epilepsy, Cancer, or even Pneumonia. Many people didn’t have much chance of surviving back then without the cure. Science is getting better and closer everyday to find other cures with the help of new technologies being build today.    Although there are cures being found for many diseases there are also new diseases found too. For example AIDS/HIV was found twenty years ago or Multiple sclerosis (M.S.). As time passes by, sure we find amazing discoveries but not all of them are always good.     Racism has also decreased during the time. Sixty years ago black people were not treated the same way as white people. Others gave them dirty looks or expected very less from them. But now everyone is treating one another the same. Laws have changed about slavery and racism. Back them if someone made a racial remark no one would care. Hate crimes were not reported, unless someone was killed, and even then, no one would have cared that racism was the motivation. Now the media exploits hate crime for sensationalism, because the majority of people today find it disturbing and outrageous.     Though one cannot change another. There are still many people out there who are still racist, doesn’t matter what race or culture it can be Blacks, Jews, Muslims, Asians. Only difference is that people have to keep their racial comments to themselves or they could face prison or court hearings.     Overall, life has become very easier for humans since last century considering all three of these arguments. Looking back you might say back then people actually took use of their life when everyone preferred to read books because there was no T.V. Or preferred to walk when there were very few cars. But this century has taken a turn and has made life for people easier. Still there is a long way to go for every human kind to have a luxurious relaxed life.             thanks for reading I wanna do well on it

20090226212529AAWBdGi	Education & Reference;Homework Help	OK!! ALMOST DONE!! Help Writing Concluding Paragraph?	In Ernest Hemingway’s three stories “ A Very Short Story”, “Hills like White Elephants”, and “ A Cat in The Rain”, the relationships are corrupted because of the lack of equality between the couple. In the relationships the American men are preponderate. Through the American men eyes the women are “inferior” to them, but do the Americans really need to be so controlling?  Through Genetic factors and childhood experiences have each affected Americans views on relationships negatively, giving Americans the mental incapability to have a stable relationship where dominance is not present.       The three American males in the stories are dominant over their partners in the relationship. The unrecognized mental disabilities of the American males in the stories is the essence of cause behind the characters lack of commitment and hence the decline of the relationships. Evidence that illustrates the dominance of the Americans and the incompatibility of the couple is found in A Very Short Story. When “they quarreled about her not being willing to come home at once” with this the American already had trouble gripping the fact that he no longer had control. He is showing his dominance when he tells her to go move over there(to New York) with him and live there to basically leave everything behind She’s going to be starting new And she doesn’t want to She is able to break free from his control but in turn, it turns the Americans life to crap. When Luz and the American go there separate ways, his life spirals down and he “contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl while riding in a taxi cab.” This would seem as wanton behavior; however, since the American lost his dominance in the relationship, he couldn’t function normally. Taking into consideration the problems that arise from the American losing his dominance, portrays how incompetent he is without control. When he contracts gonorrhea in a “taxi cab”, demonstrates how he let go of what morals, self respect, and dignity he had for himself. By losing his power over the relationship his ability to function normally is then deteriorated. Above all the American males feel they need to rule in the relationship.       The three American males in the story are in capable of being in a stable relationship were they are on the same level. Through negative past experiences the Americans are unable to cope with a relationship without the feeling of superiority. Evidence that illustrates the ascendancy of the Americans and the incompatibility of the couple is found in Hills like White Elephants. When the American is trying to persuade Jig to get an abortion he tries to sway her by using a form of reverse psychology, “I don’t want you to do it if you feel that way.” Without digging to deep you can see that the American just doesn’t want a child, it would ruin whatever good time he has, however because he tries to get her to do something other than she wants shows how iniquitous he is, to get things the way he wants them. When the American says “Dos cervezas” shows how he has to be controlling her every move and /or action. He wants certain functions to go one way, there only going to go that way. When he claims that “I don’t want you to do it” now becomes the relationship decline as she starts to wise up. By trying to persuade her, to get an abortion, he loses control over her because she then finds herself in a stronger position with her morals and beliefs to be able to not follow his orders. Basically the American males cant anything without the women under there thumb.         The three American males in the story can’t function in a relationship with equal standards. Because the Americans cant handle anything other than what they’ve “known” to be the right thing, it is both mentally and emotionally incapable for the Americans to be on the same page with the women.

20090226213919AA9oXP5	Education & Reference;Preschool	Can a daycare facility teach religion to preschoolers without permission?	My child loves his daycare classes and his friends there but the teachers are constantly playing praise and worship music. Tonight my child, during evening playtime, started asking some very pointed questions about Heaven and dying, Hell and dying, and if Jesus would meet us there. Then my child started singing a song about Jesus being Christ and saving us all. I have no problem with religion, but I want it to be taught at home not at a daycare facility where I cannot monitor it. Without pulling my child, am I in the right to investigate and ask the administrators to consider our feelings in this matter? I do know from researching the daycare is accepting state vouchers for the food program. I've broached topics before to the adminstration but have been met with, "If you don't like it, go somewhere else".

20090226214457AA11uvI	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Should I pay OR Should I not pay??? Read!?	I had a funny encounter today, and I am asking for your opinion on which way to handle the situation.       A few months ago, I went to see a Spanish tutor at her apartment for what I intended an hour long session. Despite the fact that I had to wait around for 30 minutes watching her cook and eat during our scheduled appointment time, I took her to a nearby Chile's to have our tutoring session there.       Right away I felt it was a waste of my time. I am paying the student teacher/tutor at my university $25/hour and she kept giving me SOO many stupid examples of every single topic....to make make me stay longer = make her pay more.       SO, when it was over and hour and a HALF later, we didn't really get very far and I told her that maybe in two weeks I may see her again. I paid her $25 and told her I would give her the $12.50 next time.      I never talked to her again. It was a waste of money.      Then, I saw her today on the bus. She smiled and said "hi" and asked how Spanish was going. Then she wiped the smile off her face and rudely said, "Oh, and you know you owe me $12." Shocked, I acted retarded and said I forgot (I play dumb well though) and she says, "well, you know you are going to pay me right?" (nodding her head with a brief smirk).       I got PISSED off!! I'm like, and your a student teacher!! It was like a threat. I replied seemingly sincere, "Well how should I give you the money?" She states bluntly, "I don't know" and shrugs her shoulders.      When she finally gets of the f'ng bus, she turns and smiles saying bye to me. Of course she would because she wants her money!      What would you do?!?!?!      Thanks a bunch!

20090226202113AAzus4f	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How is it schools have the right to suspend a student, just because the student disagrees with the teacher.?	I mean Freedom of Speech, I understand that you should respect people, and and so forth and that school is kind of like a job, but I mean lets say your teacher miss treats a student and you stick up for a student, and then the teacher rights you up. I mean that just tell us teenagers, not to stick up for what we believe is right, because the higher up will get us in trouble if we say something back to them. People ask what is wrong with the education system? Well some bad teachers, and school officials, along with education, and us student's being content where we are.    My point is we can not learn if we do not have people that are good at teaching. No matter how much you improve the education system, and it is not right for a teacher to be little a student. But please answer my question lol

20090226181854AA9J4tK	Education & Reference;Homework Help	I Re-wrote this somewhat,And Have to turn it in tomorrow,any help further?	In Ernest Hemingway’s three stories the relationships are corrupted because of the lack of equality between the couple. In the relationships the American men are preponderate. Through the American men eyes the women are “inferior” to them, but do the Americans really need to be so controlling?  Through Genetic factors and childhood experiences have each affected Americans views on relationships negatively, giving Americans the mental incapability to have a stable relationship where dominance is not present.      The three American males in the stories are dominant over their partners in the relationship. The unrecognized mental disabilities of the American males in the stories is the essence of cause behind the characters lack of commitment and hence the decline of the relationships. Evidence that illustrates the dominance of the Americans and the incompatibility of the couple is found in A Very Short Story. When Luz and the American go there separate ways, his life spirals down and he “contracted gonorrhea from a sales girl while riding in a taxi cab.” This would seem as wanton behavior; however, since the American lost his dominance in the relationship, he couldn’t function normally. Taking into consideration the problems that arise from the American losing his dominance, portrays how incompetent he is without control.       well that's what i have so far,   the intro   and one of the body paragraphs   its    an essay    about 3 stories   by Ernest Hemingway   a very short story   hills like white elephants   and   a cat in the rain      prompt was really vague,but at most it was   to find a "universal" theme   or something similar/recurring in the stores   well   i need to turn this in tomorrow   so any help   please   and thanks   -i don't want any help as in you giving me the answers,just to see if these paragraphs are ok, i want to do the work myself-

20081009112853AAkwrbB	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Why Is There No Screening of School Volunteers?	I have a 5 year old son and a 15 year old son both attending public school. I've been volunteering for the school board for 12 years and never had an issue re: screening. But, while attending my 5 year old's information night, the teachers were pleading for people to volunteer for their reading program. On a daily basis they wanted to have volunteers come into the school for one-on-one reading sessions with the students in isolated rooms. They even announced that no screening was required and that they were desperate for volunteers to make their reading program a success. My red flags immediately went up. I asked that my son be excluded from the program, though the school insisted that there shouldn't be an issue.      Last week my son's teacher sent home a note requesting that parents volunteer to drive senior kindergarten students to field trips as a cost cutting measure. They indicated that all students would be required to bring their booster seats to school on field trip days. When I phoned the school the principle assured me that there should be no issue with this as there would be a minimum of 4 students per parent volunteer driver, "so what could possibly happen." Again, no screening required. Furthermore, the volunteers would have to sign waivers so that the school would not be liable for their actions.       Am I off my rocker or does this cross the line?

The teacher is kind unorganized and just stacks all the homework she gets in a giant pile with each period.   4. The chance that the paper could fall in the floor randomly.   5. The possibility he can accidentally skip my homework paper.   I'm sure there are more possibility if there are please add them.  I just want to know what % is it that the teacher could lose it.

I first will be going into the pre-IB program then the IB program in grade 11 and 12. Is it really hard and lots of work?
