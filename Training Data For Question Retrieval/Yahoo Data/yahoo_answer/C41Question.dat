20090222230254AA895mx	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this proof that the Ron Paul bashers simply havn't looked into him enough?	 http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/vie...       In early 2007 I watched an online video of the 2008 Republican presidential debates. Ron Paul was among the candidates, and at first I wrote him off as a loon who was simply being overly pessimistic about foreign policy and the U.S. economy and didn't really know what he was talking about. After months of job growth in the economy and jumps in U.S. production and exports, it sounded crazy when he talked about a major recession being not too far off. However, he just wouldn't go away! He stuck in the presidential race, and in October of 2007 I decided to take a closer look at what he was saying. I watched his speeches, read his articles, and researched his voting record. He was not simply a pessimistic looking to get attention. He analyzed everything, and that's something that drew me in to research him further. And most impressive of all, his objections to both foreign and domestic policy weren't based on only his personal opinions, but rather on the Rule of Law and what the Constitution says on every issue.  It wasn't long before I was a full fledged Ron Paul supporter, but I still couldn't help but wonder if his predictions and constant warnings of a deep recession were a bit far fetched and overdone.       "We are at the verge of bankruptcy, we are moving into a New Era, believe it or not, with the dollar and our economy and the world economy. This is a New Era." -- Ron Paul; January 24, 2008        The economy seemed strong. Unemployment was dropping, exports were rising thanks to a lower dollar, and companies were reporting strong earnings. But over time I started to realize that his reasoning actually made a lot of sense to me and, evidently, a lot of other people around the U.S.      What do you think ?

Forget the whole Obama scandal, if you can, on this one. If anyone knows, especially people who live in the New York area, this paper is not known for it's ''intellectuality.'' It's like they prepare their readers, as if they're complete imbeciles. They use words like ''nabber'' and ''mugger'' all over the ''NYPD Daily Blotter'' and have Sports reporters who literally make up and start rumors out of their *ssholes.      My dad commonly refers to it as the sh*trag, but I'm sure he's not the 1st to say that... Still though, if anyone has ridden a New York subway, especially in the morning, I'm sure you've seen people read this low-intellegenced paper, trying to look smart while crossing their knee (By the way, men aren't suppose to do that lol) Take a walk around Manhattan and you'll see this paper go to like 10 cents everywhere by noon, because they print out too many copies of this rag.

Its usually interpreted to mean that religion should not play any role in gov't (mostly by democrats as an excuse for their side on abortion, gay marriage etc.).

20090222223545AApHiRa	Politics & Government;Immigration	Pro-illegals: Are you fully aware of what your stance is doing to America?	Do you like to see your tax dollars spent on illegals when U.S. citizens' needs are not even met? Do you have any idea of the impact the current rate of immigration will have on the U.S.?      It took 165 years for the U.S. to reach a population of 135 million, but will only take 40 years to add that many more people to our country. To accommodate this multitude we will need more roads, hospitals, schools (est. 36,000) and more housing. There will be unheard of demands on utility and water resources and the overall environment while severely impacting the quality of life. If an amnesty occurs, the 20 million (12 million is a joke) current illegals can all receive legal government assistance and their general lack of education and tendency for large families will overwhelm the welfare system. Are you willing to work harder so you can support them all? Their lack of education is propagated in their offspring and the cycle continues. Are you only wearing your hearts on your sleeves without thinking of the serious consequences of continued mass immigration? You need to educate yourselves in this respect and look at the big picture.

UA = Unauthorized Absence (Navy/USMC/Coast Guard term), basically it means to leave with out permission from your supervisor/boss, IE Walking off the job and staying off the job.

20090222231403AAurWdO	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	When I opened the grocery store this morning, I found a customer sitting on the floor with cheeses?	I am the manager for a branch of a popular grocery store (name I will not mention) and I want to share a disturbing incident that happened this morning. I came into the store at about 7 AM and sprawled on the linoleum floor was a man covered in cheese, with every single one of our cheese products opened up and spread all around him. Right when I saw him, he looked confused and disoriented, but when we made eye contact, I asked what he was doing and he woozily replied "theesesese are teh cheeeeeessseseseseseseses" and continued to open and spread more cheese products. His entire face was covered in cheese and it was especially prominent around his mouth, where he had been eating it. He had a very curly mustache and he looked french. I am not sure what he was doing or how he even got into the store, but I called 911 and he was supposedly taken to a mental hospital. Does anyone know anything about this?
20090222234607AAyUALG	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Is it hypocritical for Europe to lecture and criticise America on issues of foreign policy?	Examples of European imperialism and meddling is a book whereas American examples are a sentence. Even if you consider Europe to be a continent of "born again peacemakers", the consequences of thousands of years of European misadventures are still current and unresolved; Zimbabwe, Kashmir, Rwanda, South Africa, Israel/Palestine, etc... Even the Vietnam war began as a French attempt at regaining control of that colony. Shouldn't Europe take ownership and resolve the issues it created before claiming the title of moral superiority?
20090222233058AArHkda	Politics & Government;Politics	How can the general American public be sooooo stupid to accept and support the politically correct thinking?	For example:      1) Speaking against the govt is Anti-American. People like Ron Paul, Noam Chomsky are considered anti-American.      2) Speaking against any of the accepted groups in today's society is taboo, and has serious repercussions (these groups include Zionist Israel, feminists, gays, blacks, the government. The general level the society has stooped to; which is not the fault of blacks and gays necessarily).       3) Having conservative views is bashed by everyone. Horniness and promiscuous behavior are normal behaviors, even for very young kids.      Political correctness at its best?

Whose side are you on?   8) BBC World vs Fox/any American channel. Which is better?   9) Do you know who Noam Chomsky is?   10) Do you believe gays should be allowed to be married, and the conservative beliefs should be stifled?

Since one doesn't really want to make the expensive acquaintance of such fine ladies/gentlemen as a Writer to the Signet or a Sheriff-Depute, it's probably best not to meddle with one's cards of Identity

20090222223742AADrXvd	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is it greedy for me to want to keep the money I work 60-70 hours a week for?	But it's not greedy for people who are lazy to want to take my money?      A little background:      I grew up poor in Detroit Michigan.  I left home at 15 and couldn't finish High School.  I joined the Navy at 17 and got out at 21.  In 1994 I made $12,000 for the entire year.  I have worked my butt off and today I am doing well owning two businesses.  But I still work 60-70 hours per week taking only Sundays off...I know I have to pay taxes...but I think I pay too much already and now it looks like they want more.      I hear all of this "Make the rich pay their fair share" but nobody will ever define "Fair share" as a percentage!  I employ 75 people and the fact is if my taxes go up...I am cutting jobs...I am sick of it!
20090222235348AA10eqX	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is Michigan so bad off?	Michigan has the worst unemployment at 10.5% and it has been totally controlled by Democrats/Liberals for decades!  Michigan was in decline under Carter, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton and Bush II.  Regardless of who controlled Congress or who the President was, Michigan has always been worse off than anywhere else.  The only constant, has been an unbroken chain of total Liberal control.  So if Liberalism is the answer to all of our problems, why isn't Michigan doing better than anywhere else?  If Unions are the answer, why aren't businesses rushing to open shop in Union friendly Michigan?
20090222224917AAEAO0l	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you believe that most poor people are poor due to bad decisions or circumstance?	I grew up poor in Detroit Michigan.  In 1994 I made $12,000 for the entire year.  Today I am quite well off but I still work 60-70 hour weeks.  I had no college and only a 10th grade education and a GED.  I am nothing special...but I managed to make it so I wonder why others cannot.  BTW, I never took welfare or any Government handout or Government loan of any type.
20090222232056AA4BwKy	Politics & Government;Politics	Is the problem with Government that they don't tax the rich enough or that they waste money?	When I was in the Navy, at the end of every fiscal year we would fuel all 18 of our A-6 Intruders with 36,000 lbs of fuel each and fly them 100 miles out over the ocean and flip on the dump switches.  The reason, if we didn't deplete our budget for the year, we would not get the INCREASE the following year.  Every Government entity works off of the same principle, it's commonly referred to as "Use it or lose it".  Ever notice that every Fall you begin seeing advertising for welfare programs like WIC?  It's because every year Welfare programs have to use up the budget so they buy massive and expensive media campaigns advertising welfare programs...as if people don't know they exist.        I feel the rich pay far too much in taxes and the Government wastes far too much money...how about you?

I  used to work at a Ice house as a bartender,   I only worked about 3-4 days,because the owner told me that I was only gonna get paid $20 each day,because I would make tips on  top of that.   There's another bar right across the street,but they also serve hard liquor.   Shetold me that the employees at this other place doesn't make no more than $20 the whole day either,so that's why I was only gonna get $20 a day.      It doesn't make sense to me to work there the whole day at this place,   I would have been better off working at a fast food place or so.

Ok let me try to clarify and summarize the problem. I'm divorcing my husband bc he's a no good....well you know what. Anyway I am the kids payee for their social security benefits but back in June somehow my husband removed me from our joint baqnk account where everything was being sent direct deposit from SS. He took my payment that month and both of our kids. I think he actually somehow switched the bank to where everything is being deposited. So SS tells me to tell him to give me that money. He's money hungry and refused. I called them again and thought they suspended payments on our kids till everything was worked out. Come to find out they didnt and he's been getting them since June. I got the tax forms in my name saying all this money has been payed to me when in fact it hasnt. He doesnt give me the money either, hes spent it on him and his new gf.....which isn't our kids. I called SS again and they were going to put a trace on the money but now they cant bc since January the payee has been frozen in the system. They want proof my kids live with me but they cant tell me what I can use for proof. I already went and showed them a copy of the last document we had from court where the kids live with me and he gets every other weekend. And I already tried bringing the kids into the office in person. Does anyone know what I can do? Can he actually get in trouble like he deserves?

20090222233542AA7clWe	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	California Vehicle Code 21461?	Hi, thanks in advance for the comments.        My father received a citation for violating CVC.21461, he drove his work truck onto a street where the truck exceeded the allowed weight limit.        (He was driving in an unfamiliar area) when he pulled into a left hand "turn only" lane, as he turned he saw the sign posted onto the street that he was turning onto indicating that his style of truck was not allowed.  He could not make a U about so he looked for the first place to make a 3 point turn out of there but it was too late since the cop was aleady coming in the opposited direction and motioned him to pull over (less than 50 yards into the street itself).  Do you think he has a case in fighting it considering there was no sign neither from the time he exited the freeway to the time he entered the left hand turn lane; nor was there a sign on the left hand turn lane traffic signal etc. warning people that the street they were turning onto had a weight restriction?        I realize that he did violate the weight restriction, i.e., he did drive his truck there; but it just seems to me that there was no reasonable way anyone who doesn't already know the area can be expected to know of this restriction.        Thanks so much for your comments/help.

And year 2007, I left Philippines leaving the internet connection to my siblings. Before I left, I knew the one year contract is over, but they still used the internet after I left.  Now these past months (maybe 3 months), the subscription weren't payed. My siblings went in the office to ask them to terminate the connection.

20090222235600AACPu41	Politics & Government;Government	Obama's immigration plan flawed?	well i agree with Obama one a lot of things but I just gotta ask does anyone else see the flaw in his immigration plan? I mean he says he wants to increase the number of legal immigrants so that they don't have to be separated from their families. but the truth is if they didn't want to be separated from their families they would have never left their hme land. also he say he wants to increase legal immigration to help fill the jobs employers can't fill. Right now there is a shortage of jobs in the country we can't afford more people. I mean I understand some illegal immigrants came here to better their life's but what about the ones who just want a free ride? I personally think all grants and jobs should be given to american Citizen before the Citizen of other counties. so i guess my question is does any one else see the flaw in his plan?

20090203134445AAMpVQv	Politics & Government;Government	Is being labeled Patriot/Traitor simply a matter of who writes the history?	At one time George Washington was labeled by the British as a traitor to the crown. At that time the "crown" was the undisputed ruler of our country. Is it possible that back the George was very radical and desperatly trying to do what he thought was best when he saw himself and his countrymen being taxed to death, having no real civil rights, and being treated a lot like slaves to their government. He was right really. He was also a traitor at the time. It's easy to hop onboard the popular train... go with the flow and just fit in. It's hard to be a traitor I think... trying to change a flawed system and make things better for everyone. After his cause caught on he had a lot of support... of course. It was much easier then. It takes a hero, or a patriot to start a revolution. I wish America's hero would show up soon. When Obama has given the last of our money away (I hope everyone knows that is all the money we have, to get more we have to print it out and devaluate our dollar... at that point it's all over for us) to his buddies. We are doomed I think... from an economic point of view anyway. I guess we had a good run.

No one is going to sue me if I have even one word to say in the matter. LOL   Thanks to the hook-nosed parasitic lawyers, our society is one big contentious adversarial cesspool. Don't blame me. Blame the Ratsteins and the Verminbaums.      Do you agree or not? See what the lawyers have caused...

20090203134330AA0nOAn	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Should Michael Phelps not have apologized for smoking Marijuana and called for legalization instead?	Either way, Phelps is probably going to be persecuted by the government and by the crazed World Anti-Doping Agency.  Although I recognize that smoking marijuana is probably not a wise thing to do, it is definitely less harmful than activities which are legal under the government's current laws, such as smoking tobacco or drinking alcohol.  Furthermore, the right to put whatever substances you wish into your own body is a fundamental right of all human beings.  The Drug War is based fundamentally on the view that people do not own their own bodies, but rather that the government owns the bodies of all its "citizens" (arguably the term "serfs" would be more accurate), and that it has the "right" to tell them what they can and cannot put in their body.  How is it that pregnant women are allowed to kill unborn babies in our society (just to clarify, I'm not intending to comment one way or the other on the legal status of abortion here), yet adults are prohibited from putting whatever substances they wish into their own bodies?      What right does anybody have to tell Michael Phelps or any other person what they can put in their own body?  Why should Michael Phelps apologize for smoking the wrong plant?  Isn't it absurd to continue this drug war when our last 3 presidents have all been former drug users (Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are known former marijuana users; George W. Bush is a known former cocaine user and a known former alcoholic)?  Afterall, it can hardly be argued that Michael Phelps made a "mistake" any more than it can be argued that the large numbers of Americans who smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol have made a "mistake" by doing so.      Will this cause some of the hypocrites who support the continuation of the fiscally irresponsible and tyrannical War on Drugs to reconsider their position?  We can only hope so.

20090203133522AA1nPAI	Politics & Government;Politics	2/3/2009,Survey:Sarah Palin, as an American President, would dig us out of this hole. Agree or disagree?	During the October 2008 Vice Presidentail debate, Sarah Palin said: "Barack Obama is proposing...nearly a trillion dollars in new spending that he's proposing is the backwards way of trying to grow our economy." See  http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/02/d...  . Accordingly, a couple days later, she promoted "a spending freeze" to cover all but the most vital functions of government in order to cut wasteful spending. Sarah Palin, said: "We have to do this. You know, we're in a hole. What do you do when you're in a hole? You don't want to be there. You stop digging." See  http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/10/07/c...  .      Significantly enough, on January 29, 2009, Barack Obama, says: "The American people understand that we've got a big hole that we've got to dig ouselves out of--but they don't like the idea that people are digging a bigger hole even as they're asked to fill it up." See  http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/Sham...  . Accordingly, "Some Senate Republicans vow opposition to stimulus plan":      "A trillion dollars is a terrible thing to waste," said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss      "This is about spending money that we don't have for things we don't need," said Sen. Tom Coburn, R-okla.      "This is not a stimulus bill. It was a spending bill," Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va, the GOP whip, said.   See  http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/...  .      More importantly, it was Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell who said Sarah Palin has "good political instincts.      What's your political party and gender?

I bought a used car (2006 Pontiac GTO) about two months ago and JUST recently found out that the title has a lemon law/manufacturer buyback on it. It was a defect in the paint supposedly. It claims that the defect was remedied, then sold at auction.......      then over the course of the past year it has been retitled, but the lemon law thing still pops up........      SHOULD the dealer have told me about this in WRITING when I purchased the car, or have they gone against the law???? (I'm from Illinois)...... I've been reading here and there that if a car was previously bought back because of a defect/lemon law that it should be presented to you in writing at the time of sale if the car gets resold later. The dealership never told me ANYTHING!      Am I able to do something about this, like take the dealership to court or have them buy it back or something???
