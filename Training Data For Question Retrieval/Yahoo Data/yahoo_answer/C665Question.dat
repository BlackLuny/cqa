20090304091622AAP4WSB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I stand up to my controlling friend?	-She talks crap behind everyone's back, but is the sweetest thing to them to their face. I thought she liked me until someone told me recently she does the same to me. She apparently thinks it's annoying if I call her to hang out, yet she tells everyone I'm her best friend!      -When we hang out and I'm driving, she says "Oh by the way, I need to go to this store, this store, etc, etc..is that okay?" If I refuse, she makes me feel bad. When I had to go to just ONE store on the same trip, she said "Just make sure you hurry". But I was the one driving her around to four different places!      -She is always tries to tell me what to do, and I always give in for some reason! She's so manipulative. One time I overdrank at a party with her and passed out and she left me in the bathroom and didn't try to help me at all. Then she went back home that night and left me at the party in some stranger's house and never picked me up the next morning.      -I want to know how to stand up to her and start calling some of the shots, only because I got paired with her this semester to do a project with her. So I have to be around her now. She always tries to slack off on the project, and she makes me drive her around everywhere when we have to get stuff for the project.      -How can I tell her we need to get down to business and tell her she needs to drive some days without being afraid to tell her?

Ok my boyfriend of 5 years and I have decided to take a break due to alot of arguments and saying things we don't mean. I was against the time apart and have decided to just go on with my life and see what happens. I love him with all my heart we have 1 wonderful child. But he is the one that wanted the break and now he always asks me where im going, what I did all day, He makes jokes about me and other men which is not what i wanna do right now. Well anyways to the point we fought over the phone over me getting my daughters first haircut without him and then it went into our relationship and how he only cares about stuff and not our family so he hangs up on me. He them proceeds to call me back 25 times in a row and I ignore him because im crying and didn't want to fight because that's are main problem im trying to avoid to put our family together. Well now its been 3 days and he hasn't attempted to call back. the next day the baby an I called him and she left him a message saying hi daddy so I did make the first move but since then no call back. Does thins mean hes done????? He hasn't came to get his stuff from the house nor has he deleted me from his myspace.

20090304091805AAHhCd5	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I just cut ties with my parents?	Over the last year I have realized my parents aren't the great wonderful people I thought they were. I have realized they have taken a lot of money from my bank account since I was young. Wasted a lot of money on stupid diet pills that never worked and clothes that my mom never wore.  They lie about a lot of things.  I used to talk to my mom at least once if not 3 times every day on the phone. But now I don't even want to talk to her. My dad drinks and it seems now once I have seen how other fathers are. And what other kids did I missed out on a  lot of things. He didn't miss work or go out to drink he stayed home and made our lives hell. Some times he was fun but other wise he wasn't I have been very embarrassed of him being drunk my whole life.    Is it better just to tell them I'm done and very hurt or just stop talking to them?    I'm now 21 haven't lived at home for over 2 years. And the events since I turned 21 (a month ago) have really made me realize a lot about my parents. I'm really starting to cling to my boyfriends family. (we have been together 5 years) They may buy us more. But at the same time they stop over at random because they want to see us. They do little things. My parents don't.    I just don't know what to do next?

20090304092101AAmgNKS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just moved out with my girlfriend.  What can I do about her parents?	I recently (last weekend) moved in with my girlfriend.  We are renting our own place, and its the first time we have moved out of our parents house.      Her parents have been over almost every night since we moved in, helping unpack stuff, wash dishes, clean, fix stuff, etc.      I'm getting frustrated.  Its our place, and I want us to do the majority of the stuff around the place.  I'm not saying I don't want their help, but they help too much.  For example, my girlfriend wouldn't let me finish cleaning the cupboards so I could wash our cooking ware because she wanted her mom to finish.  We also have a sofa coming Saturday, and currently have a futon where the couch is going to go.  Her mom last night was like "oh me and your dad can come over Friday night and move the futon for you", when we are more then fully capable.      Its just frustrating because it makes me feel like they think I'm an idiot, or that we cant do anything by ourself.  My girlfriend is no better though, as she does not see where I am coming from at all.      I moved out to have a little bit of independence, not for her parents to virtually live with us and run the place.  What can I do?      Thanks!

20090304092757AAZCvYx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is my nephew weird? Advice please?	My nephew is about 3 1/2yrs old.      He has always struck me as a little strange, gloomy and distant, but what would I know, I don't have kids.      Anyway, I was over at my brothers this afternoon to look after him with my sister in law (who has just had another baby so busy), and fell asleep on the couch he has in his patio area.      When I woke up, my nephew had taken what looked like pretty much every knife from the kitchen and arranged them in a rough circle around where I was sleeping. He was standing on a wicker chair just staring at me when I woke.      My sister in law was upstairs feeding the new born, she does not use formula so takes ages, and so knows nothing about this as I quickly put the knifes back.      Anyway, I don't know whether to tell them, or just to ignore it as normal activity for a boy.

20090304092252AAdb3Cx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I demand honesty...after lying, cheating?	My ex/fiancee after lying and cheating w/ his ex while i was away, wants to come back to the relationship.  He says he will be honest and forthcoming.  He has made certain gestures towards that, like calling the ex/ tell her that it was a mistake and that it will not happen again, when women give him advances, he tells them to stop and don't do it because he doesn't want to disrepect me, and other stuff he has been doing. I haven't taken him back.  We separated.  I thought if he is going to work at being honest he has to do it on his own and then i will see what i do.  My problem is the following, should i demand that he be totally honest with details as to what happened while i was away.  I've asked him repeatedly for this and he is forthcoming ONLY when i ask a specific question, otherwise he doesn't say anything else about it.  And i'm the type of person that in order to start over you have to lay it out in the open and then lets pick it up from there.  If i decide to pick it up from there.  He says it was a one night thing.  but i think if the fling is now in the open what is the problem talking about it? What's there to loose?  Should I give him a last ultimatum, either you talk or you walk for ever out of my life?  Is this threatening what I'm doing?  Please advice.
20090304092303AAgB4ax	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I just being over sensitive?	Every year on my siblings birthdays, I seem to get over jealous of them.   Well, not really jealous, but more depressed.   My birthday is on December 21st, which means no one ever remembers it. I usually just get two gifts, one from my Grandma, and one from my mom.    But on my other siblings birthdays, everyone we know gives them gifts. And it really depresses me. I feel like, people don't care enough about me to remember. It's been like this since I was younger, and now I'm fifteen.       What do you think?   Am I wrong for getting upset?
20090304092638AACOK1e	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help about this boy!?	Ok so this guy I met off of facebook from a friend that showed this group on there for me to join into. I did. The guy who owns it is a type one diabetic just like me and has a lot in common with me and we go to schools that are in the same school system. I started talking to him because he asked me who I was. We talked and it was about 3 hours long I gave him my cell phone number and said goodnight on facebook to him. 10 mins later I get a text telling me its him and just wanted me to know his number. and he said well night, I said ok goodnight, and he said you to. I may be wrong but i think that is flirting. Then this moring he texts me saying "I don't think i have ever had a girl give me their number." and i said im different then most. and it continues throughout today he is still texting me. I think he likes me and he is single right now so what do you think. My friend who has two classes with him at a college talks to him about me and says she can't tell me what he said but its good and she smiles like she knows he has something to tell me!  helpppppp!

20090304092249AAqwxqH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What could happen in court with my bf's kids?	Ok, I will start by giving the details as they are now.      -3 kids; 13, 11, 9.   -All have been going to the same school for 8 years.   -Current school does not offer busing to or from school which in turn we have an hour to and an hour from commute to school everyday.   -Current school does not offer hot lunch program; we must pack lunches Mon. - Thurs.   -All 3 kids have lived primarily with their father in the same home for 8 years.   -School is too far away to get kids involved in extra curricular activities after school (2 hour commute would cut out time for homework/dinner/family time).   -Their mother has moved 8 times in the last 3 years since the divorce including a 4-5 month move to San Diego to live with her BF.      My bf wants to change the childrens school to the public school that is in our area, and his ex-wife has petitioned the court to keep them in their current school.  Here are the reasons he would like to change the school.      -There is busing to and from school.   -The bus stop is about 50 yards from our home on the corner of our private road.   -The kids could easily participate in extra curricular activities without impeding on homework/dinner/family time.    -Schools are approximately a 5-10 minute drive away.   -The schools in our area offer a lunch program, which our 7 person family would qualify for reduced/free lunches for all of the children including breakfasts.      We want what is best for the children and from our point of view, we are not asking too much.  The mother has been completely unstable the 3 years following the divorce, and has been unable to even constantly provide transportation for the 3 kids.  She is currently hiding her vehicle in her garage because the finance company has been trying to reposess it.  She's had an abusive boyfriend in and out of her life living with her & her children and have involved the children in at least one altercation that required the police to be called.  We are not trying to take any time away from her being a mother, but are however trying to change the childrens school to one that is closer to their "home".        Does this sound unreasonable or do you think we will triumph over instability?

20090304095604AAbyQIJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question for the Guys - What would it mean if you still stared at a girl/friend who you already scored with?	this is happening to me, this guy has been my friend and we chat a lot when I come to the bar where he works. We have hooked up a few times, but he still looks at me in the bar, and stares at me, sneaks looks when I'm not looking. Just like he did before he ever met me.       he told me once that I was so beautiful to him that he gets "locked in" but he just always stares at me out of all the other girls even though we know each other now and have had a sexual relationship. When he looks at me, it's usually not that lustful sexual stare (it has been sometimes) it is usually a look of getting lost in me? What would that mean to you?

I said "well I think the problem is she's only interested in being with a woman because she loves receiving (and not really interested in giving to another woman)."      Some women tend to believe that if you sleep with a woman its not cheating - so they mess with other women on the low ( i know a lot of them - this is not a myth).      Is my theory wrong?

20090304100248AA2WX7c	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I be annoyed about how he proposed?	My fiance proposed to me on Christmas eve, which he knows is my very favourite day of the year, it was in Paris by the biggest Christmas tree there (again something very special to me) and he cuddled up to me brought out a wrapped up box, like a present and I opened it he took the box from me and asked me. The thing is I'm sure Im being stupid but he knew i have dreamed of him going down on one knee. He did say after that the reason he hadnt was cos of there being so many people. It was really romantic and I really love him but just feel ive missed out on my moment.       Can people please give me a shove in the direction of just feeling happy bout it as I know this is ridiculous and am over the moon to be engaged just when am low it bugs me!

20090304094438AAfH3N8	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Where do you find a good-quality woman?	By good-quality, I mean someone who is intelligent, confident, honest, mature, and treats herself and others with respect. Above all, she lives her life with dignity.      In other words, someone who isn't a shrill, obnoxious drama queen who thinks that the most important things in life are gossip and shoe shopping. There are WAY too many women who act that way, and I'm tired of it.      So, where do you find a REAL woman?
20090304100112AAwyrKm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I make my move?	So, I've had girlfriends before, but they always made the first move and asked me out.  So I have no 'real' experience making a move.  Not to menchon the girl I like is kinda shy, so I can't read her and she's really hard to hang around.      Her friends save her seats in all her classes, I can never get her for a group project (It would make it too obious since all my friends ask me 1st.  Bro's before Ho's.), she sit's near my ex at lunch (my ex seems to supervise us everytime we talk to eachother), she goes to my church, but I NEVER see her (its a big church).      I want to sorta hint that I like her without making it obious to everyone else.  I hate when I someone fall into the pool of gossip.  It's gay.  Not to menchon my ex already noticed something was going on and invited my crush to her house (and talked about who knows what).  She might do something worse if it's too obious.      Anyways, I can't think of any way to even talk to her. (Without having to ask a bunch of random questions about school)  Any help?!      THANK YOU!

She hired a detective to follow him and she has followed him herself. Only last week she saw him twice with another woman. (and i mean with, she saw them!!) anyway today she told me  that they are getting back together and i couldn't believe it.      He has treated her badly in the past, not physically but mentally. Torturing her with cruel names and basically being nasty. She has come to me so many times crying and i just can not understand the logic in getting back with him.    Can anyone help me understand or am i right in believing she would be better off without him??

20090304093245AAGFwe1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Over 21 please!! Some of you on here are soo smart and mature. Need advice please. 10 points !!!?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.

20090304093411AALSteT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I seriously need some advice...?	Okay. When I was 13 years old I acted stupid [you don't got to tell me] & I was into drugs and sex and all this stupid stuff. I lost my virginity to this guy & we continued having sex. Eventually, my Dad caught us on [on camera in the back of his store- I didn't know they had a camera]. So basically he HATES this guy. Well, it has been 3 years, and we have started talking again. Last night he asked me out to Applebees, he even said he would pay and he wouldn't mind if my Mom and son came. This is a totally different person than the other guy I knew- the other one would be thinking of ways for us to get alone. I really want to try this again, but take it slow. We both have kids [mine is almost 2 months, his is 2 weeks], and we have realized our mistakes. He has changed big time. We both are home schooled. Myself, so I can stay home and take care of my son. & him, because he has a full time job to support his. Sex isn't an option here, neither of us want another child. The question is how to get my Dad to let me go out with him? What do I say? What would help? & please, don't bash me for having a child by the time I was 15. I am doing a great job. I am planning on graduating and becoming a dental hygienist. My son isn't a mistake, just a large bump in the road- and this is not going to stop me from accomplishing my dreams- nothing will. It'll just make them more challenging & I can be twice as proud of myself in the long run. I've learned my lesson, & sex before marriage isn't going to happen. Say I am wrong all you want, but I am not even going to put myself in a situation where that will be possible. I am keeping it in public places and under supervision. :) Thanks,
20090304100001AASvppw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is divorcing over the lack of sex a legitimate reason for ending a marriage?	My best friend (we're all over 40) is probably headed for divorce after 20 years of marriage. My wife and I talked about the reason for the divorce and disagree on the end result of the main problem: sex.      Anyway long story short - His wife has apparently had enough of sex and has no interest in it anymore. I'm not judging either of them because I dont know of their emotional or physical needs, but as a man I can easily understand the need for just plain sex.      My wife on the other hand says hes being selfish and that sex isnt everything. I agree to some extent but then again we dont have that problem so I cant honestly offer an opinion based on my own experiences.      Apparently its been over sexually for them for a few years now and hes finally reached his end.      Any opinions about divorcing over sex?
20090304093258AApkBhL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do YOU know if you're good looking?	What I mean by my question is, without anyone elses opinion (ignoring what others have told you and ignoring the attractiveness of your former/current partner), when you look in the mirror, do you think you're good looking?  I ask this because I joined Match.com and out of 200+ people that I have shown interest in, only 2 have responded the same way (note: 70% of those 200+ girls I showed interest were asian, I say this because I'm asian too).  I look in the mirror (not to sound gay, but I know what people consider as good looking guys) and I think i'm good looking (not a 10, maybe a 7 or 8 if 5 is average).  So what you see in the mirror, does it accurately reflect itself in you're social life?

First there was a girl that really liked me and asked me out a lot of times. So finally I just said yes to see what would happen, because maybe I would start to like her more. That never happend, so after about a week I broke up with her. The same day another girl asked me out, and for some reason even though I barely knew her, I said yes. I soon found out that my first girlfriend and my new one were really good friends, so I basically dumped her and went out with her best friend... So now my old gf like hates me . Also my new one  said that she loves me, and I don't even like her that much. Like I really like her but not love.. Now I'm thinking about ANOTHER girl that I like, and I dont know what happend in my life. I used to be much better at this stuff.    So over all my orginal gf hates me, my new one like loves me but I don't love her, and I am thinking about another girl I like. WHAT SHOULD I DO?    -Thanks a bunch

She has a child that has been sick off and on for the last 2 months so she missed a lot of work due to that.  Then her boyfriend broke up with her and she was too depressed to get out of bed and missed some days because of that.  Now she is "over sleeping" and has not been in for a week.  I have told her that her work ethic has made me look bad and she apologized but I just don't know what to do about her.  I know she needs the money desperately, but she has zero initiative.  I don't want to fire her but I just don't know what to do about it anymore.  Any suggestions?

20090304095220AA6oVht	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My best friend starting to go out with my dream girl? And he knows it!?	So there is this girl that I have know for about 31/2 years now and since the first time I have seen her, i have fallen in love with her. at first we kind of liked each other, but she was going out with this one guy, so it was the typical 'If i wasn't going out with him, I would go out with you' deal. so we stayed just friends for the next couple months. Then she breaks up with the kid and is in an emotional wreck.. I'm there and she appreciates that I'm always there for her and always taking care of her, well basically being the 'guy' best friend  that she has. So time goes by and were still friends but not that close any more because she got a new boyfriend. I mean, this girl can get any guy she wanted with a snap of a finger, just to put it that way with no exaggeration. So sum stuff happens and she is sent away because she is not in her studies,, I'm there for her going away party and everything, and i haven't seen her in days, and she is looking beautiful as always. Well her and her boyfriend stay together through it all, and hes a player and she doesn't even know it. Her mom sends her back to our hometown and she finds out that she has been cheated on. So now she comes to me for me to comfort her and to feel that she has someone that she can rely on any time of any day. we start hanging out and going to party's and stuff, and everyone thought that me and her were having a little 'something', but then she had a kickback at her house and it went wild. drinking and doing sum other things and we start having those emotional talks, drunk out of our minds. and sum stuff spills that I love her and all that, that everything that I have been doing for the past few months was for her to even notice me in a different way. Her best girl friend tells me that she only loves me as a best friend, and that she knows my best friend likes her and she doesn't like him either. During this all I realize that she was in her room with my best friend, but i didn't think of it much since her best friend told me that she didnt have feelings for him either. So im pretty devastated, for the first time in many many years. I mean i never shed tears, and on this occasion it all came out, that she was my serious first true love. im 19 and i kind of have a good idea now. So the week comes in and I kind of start getting my mind off things and start hanging out with friends more, and then i find out that she is starting to talk with my best friend..... I start sweating and I throw up a couple times. its just a horrible feeling knowing that your going to have to be dealing with that,, seeing that on a daily basis. i talk to my other friends and they say to talk to him and let him know how I feel, because he knows that I have loved her for the longest time. In reality I know that I should be happy for him, but it just kills... like he just stabbed me and is laughing. The worst is yet to come. Im going over to his house today to talk about it, hopefully something good will come out of it. I just dont know what else to do... help a brotha out!

Ok i'm in college and theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home that goes to another college and I think they seem really close with each other. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while cause it was awkward and she said she loves her b/f, and she wasnt sure how i got the impression i liked her. now is she lying when she said she really doesnt like me and why is she acting like this if were goin be friends? Oh and i even caught her stairing at me a couple of times after this whole situation happened. So why is she actin like this and what do I do about it?
20090304100705AAwN40R	Family & Relationships;Family	When do I tell my child about her real father?	I got pregnant with my daughter 10 yrs ago. I was young and met her father and became pregnant within 6 months of us meeting, Well when he found out I was pregnant he said it wasn't his and decided to discontinue our relationship. At that point I did not want to be with someone that didn't want his child. He had 6 kids prior to my daughter and was heavy into drugs. I never talked to him again until 3 yrs later. When I was 6 weeks pregnant I met my current husband and he did not care that I was pregnant. So when I had my child 7 3/4 months later he signed the birth certificate. When she was 3 my husband and I decided to try and give her father a chance. It worked for about a week and then he told me that he would rather have his drugs instead of his child. We ended it with no contact since. But now as she is getting older ( 10 yrs) I feel the need to tell her. I have been through cancer and recovered but it could come back. I would rather me tell her than someone out of the family before I die. When should I do this and should I discuss this with my husband and what should I tell my daughter.When I tell her should I continued to child support and get a paternity test done and make it official that she is his via the birth certificate. I am so confused and not sure what to do . Please Help.

20090303222557AAXzhOm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How can I handle being single/My own person?	I've been with my boyfriend for four years. We have been having a lot of problems as of late that I really don't feel like getting into at the moment and I want to detach myself from him. Not necessarily break up, but become my own person. I feel as though I rely on him for everything to the point where I base my happiness off of the way our relationship is at the moment. I do not want to continue to do that. Unfortunately, I do not have any friends to fall back on. (I dropped all my friends after high school because I stopped doing drugs and they wouldn't.) I am currently going to a community college and am wondering if anyone has any suggestions on meeting and maintaining friendships with people outside of school. I'm not at all socially awkward, however, I can not seem to bridge the gap between in-class friend and out of school friend. I just need to know how to meet people and also, how to enjoy time to myself as well as how to sever the attachment I have to my boyfriend (ei, ways to stop calling him, get him come to me etc...)      thanks in advance.
20090304071244AACuMmx	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is my ex acting like this?	I broke up with my ex 6 months ago because I couldn't take his indirectness and playing mind games with me anymore. I seriously hate to have my time wasted. But anyway, he still is on my myspace page. I didn't think it was that serious to delete him because I really don't get on there that much. Unlike him, when we were dating he got on their everyday like it was a job. Anyway, around the beginning of january while minding my own business I get a message from myspace routed to my email. It was my ex. He stated to give him a call at his new cell phone number. However, my friends recently told me he has a new girlfriend. Now since I've been working my @$$ off at my job because I work 10 hour shifts I didn't get to my email till 4 days later. So when I saw his message for him to give him a call at his new cell phone number I was shocked. So asked him is it ok that call him because I swear as soon as I signed into my myspace he put a picture of him and her at a birthday extravaganza. He's response was I don't think it's a good idea me and my CURRENT girlfriend had a fight that day and I was drunk when I did that then said he was sorry. My response was yea whatever. Anyway, just last thursday he sends me another message stating through myspace stating whats my new cell phone number. I got back to him the next day because I didn't check my email the day before. So I responded to him by saying, look I don't know if your drunk or not, but here's my new cell. Anyway I noticed that he had cut out the part of the picture where his girlfriend was. I also notice that he no longer lives out of state, but actually 15 mins from me. Anyway, I haven't heard from him since he sent me that message. I'm honestly was about to delete him from my page, but something told me don't give him the satisfaction of knowing that he's irritating me. BTW, we're not teens or in our early 20's. I'll be 27 next tuesday and he'll be 27 in july. Which is why I think both of us is too damn old for this sh!t.
20090304102248AADdywZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did I overreact or am I justified?	My fiance and I have an an overall great 5- yr relationship (ups and downs like anyone else).  We seem to have a recurring argument over his "hanging out with friends" which consists of drinking.  I am in a very demanding graduate program and any distractions really interfere with what I need to do.  He has never been into going to school so my stress and course load is not something he can understand completely.  We constantly disagree over whether or not he should be able to hang out with the guys and drink during the week.  I find it unexceptable because he comes home buzzed and its like I can't even talk to him cause he's a different person (not angry or violent just not as cognizant as he would be normally) and this annoys me beyond belief.  So once again on Monday-instead of coming home at 5pm he shows up at 8 buzzed yet denying having gone to a bar.  I packed my stuff and have stayed at a hotel since then.  1st night he kept texting to say I am overreacting now he has not contacted me since 3pm yesterday.  Am I over doing it or do I have a right to be angry?
20090304063744AAO6nUs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What's the best way to tell my family? should i ask their opinion first or just do what i want?	ok. my boyfriend and i met two months ago and have been officially bf/gf for one month. we are absolutely in love and want to get married in a couple months (skipping the engagement stuff). i know most people will think it's way too soon, and we're rushing things, etc. but i've never felt this way about any other guy i've ever dated, and deep down, i am positive he's the only one for me. my previous boyfriend and i were together for 4.5 years, and it was a complete waste of time. i tried really hard to hold on to that relationship even though i knew it wasn't right.      with my current boyfriend, our feelings for each other are true and open... and intense, and i know it'll be like that forever (it won't fizzle out). so, since we both know we want to get married, should i go ahead and tell my family beforehand? or should we just tell them afterwards, so they can't try and talk us out of it?      i know most people will react the way i would have acted before i met my boyfriend. they'll say it's too soon... we need to get to know each other better and blah blah blah. but i know we're meant for each other, so giving me that kind of advice is irrelevant. i can't see myself with anyone else EVER, so why wait 2-3 years for the inevitable?      i don't care much about how my friends will react, but i want my family to support my decision. so, any thoughts on how to deal?

20090304071131AAFfvbH	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need help with my friends?	My friends and I saw each other in a restaurant, so I sat next to them. I came there by myself to order something and they ordered something too. So, after me and them got our foods, they said to me, they are going back to their apartments (during their meal, they didn't finish their meal) so I went back to my own apartment. Usually people leave after the meal is finish or leave after they ordered the meal, not during. If that is during the meal, does that mean something went wrong? or was I not invited to join them?
20090303230650AAVFYKG	Family & Relationships;Family	Help with my son's  PLEASE?	my oldest who's 17 and a senior has been a handful when it comes to alot that I wont' get into. Anyway he's been failing thruout HS and weve grounded him took away privileges and stuck to it for 21/2 yrs before we finally gave up. He pretty much goes to school to hang with his friends and disrupt class. So now that we dont punish him anymore our freshman son is starting to getfailing grades. He is nothing like his sibling but we took away his privileges recently and he's mad yet says he understands why we are doing this to him but yet he complained to his big sis about it and I'm feeling bad. Don't you think we are right in giving him some sort of punishment for 3 F's. His brother we just can't control anymore. yet we want them both to graduate and do well for themselves. 1 son won't but we still have faith that # 2 son will do good.   What I guess I'm asking is should we start punishing the 17yr old again to justify # 2 son. But when we do 17 yr old is IMPOSSIBLE horribly meanly impossible.

20090304062317AAT4WDw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does society make women especially " black women" feel like they aren't good enough if they aren't married?	I just read some statistics that said 48% of black women have never been married and 25% of white women have never been married and so on......They make it seem like we are just a group of lonely women taking up precious space.  Its like the pressure is not there for men.  I am 23 years old, about to be 24 in march.  I am in dental school and yes, i have dated alot of guys, but none of which i would want to spend my life with.  Should i be forced to settle for someone who has his own set of problems, not saying i am perfect.  I mean society makes marriage out to be this glorious thing, but why is there so many divorces, cheating spouses, unhappily married women.   I dont understand it!  Why would you want something so badly that in the end has a great chance of making you trapped in a misery pit of doom.  Divorce rates are over 50% , then take into account the number of unhappily married people who stay in marriages because they are afraid to be alone.  Why is it assumed that if a WOMAn is single something has to be wrong with her.  You don't see assuming something is wrong with the men who are single.   And why does society try to make women feel bad about being single? especially black women by throwing statistics in our faces???   I am not saying marriage is all bad, but seriously finding your soul mate and being happy through the majority of the marriage is very very rare these days.  Most people settle into unhappy marriages just to avoid being alone.  Some people have open marriages where they allow or know their spouse is cheating , and don't care as long as he comes home.  its like women and men are settling ( for whats not always that best for them)   I am sorry I'd rather be single than be in an unhappy marriage, crying myself to sleep because my husband isn't coming home when he suppose to.
20090304071651AAt6Iyg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will she be happy in her marriage?	I am looking for honest advice.  This is such a sad story, and I am trying to move on, even though I am struggling so much.   My exgirlfriend and I were together for 4 years total.  We were in love, things were great. I just wanted to wait to get married, but we were good, and I did stall in marry her, I KNOW this.   She got a little sick and had some sort of uterus problem and the doctor told her she should be fine, but that in the future there could be complications with kids. My ex freaked out, and internalized this as "I cant have kids, i have to get pregnant now." She asked me if I wanted to have a baby, she got really desperate and I told her that medically she would be fine and that we would wait. Well, she dumped me and 4 months later married another guy and she told me, my mom, dad, family that she ONLY married him bcs she didnt want to risk NOT marrying and NOT having a baby. This happened one year ago.       The first 7 months of her marriage she called me constantly to tell me she was confused, loved me, probably made a mistake, and wished she was married to me instead, but that her husband treats her really well. She says that she got married for the baby (she is still not pregnant) but that she must honor her commitment, even though it is not want she really wanted.      If this is how she got married and feels, will this marriage work?? Will she eventually be happy? I just need to know.

20090303224652AAwpEsO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am too dependant of my boyfriend. what to do?	I have been dating my boyfriend since december last year when we were in grade twelve. it's been a year and 3 months and we have a pretty good relationship. its straining because we work practically opposite hours but we never fight and hang out often. so the issue is that he has friends, lots of them and hangs out with them sometimes which is cool. but i just sit at home when he does this. i have a best friend girl but she lives with her bf and we dont hang out much. since i got my bf i havent talked to many of my old friends because i would spend time with him. he makes me happy and i just like being with him. i recently discovered this is sad sad and sadder since i have like no friends anymore. they all have new ones. siigh., feel like making me feel better?      oh yes.. september last year i started at a new school where i met him. thats when i had began to make new friends in the same group as my bf so we basically have the same friends but i never hang out with them without him anymore. its weird like since we started dating, im now just 'jordans girlfriend' and not me. i miss hanging out with them but its awkward without him.

20090304065821AAoCBOk	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My girlfriends parents hate me and are forcing our break up? Any advice?	I'll keep this short... basically my girlfriend and i have been together for almost two years. Her parents were ok with us going out but never really liked me that much. But because of our arguments and disputes (which is normal in every relationship), she was forced to break up with me by her parents. So she's not allowed to see me or talk to me.. I'm 19 and she's 17. She's very submissive to her parents and is not independent at all, and she isn't strong willed, so she refuses to speak up to her parents or see me anyway (being that she's basically grown)... My thoughts are that if she really loves me she would just be with me anyway.. regardless of what her parents think about me. And being that she's 17, she should have the guts to face her parents and say that she's gonna be with me regardless of what they think, if she really wants to be with be (which she's says she does...) What do you think i should do? What do you think she should do?       (Stupid comments will be deleted so don't even waste your time)

20090303220419AAenU8b	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	In love with old friend in Sweden and I'm in the US?	Hey everyone (this is worth reading, I promise),   I am now a Freshman in college and met a guy at school in 8th grade while living in Sweden, AFTER becoming good friends with his sister and getting to know his family very well. I had a huge crush on him and he had one on me, we just were pretty shy back then. After 8th grade I moved back to the US & didn't see him again 'til 4 years later (this past summer). He came to suprise me at my friends house RIGHT when I got there from the airport, and then a countless number of other wonderful things happened and I fell in love with him all over again.      This past week, he actually came to visit me in Atlanta, paid for the ticket himself (and he's not turning 18 until a couple weeks from now), bought me a guitar, and finally told me that he loves me, after years of feeling like he did, but I wasn't sure. He's not the type to do this unless he REALLY means it, and his family agrees with that as well. I know we are young but I would love to move back to Sweden, as I feel like I belong there and act more Swedish than American, as I lived there for 6 years (If I move, I might have to finish college first). I am going to see him again this summer. :) While he was here, atleast 20 people asked if we were married. Why would they think that since it's a step up from being together? I guess we have some kind of chemistry going on or something. Either way, he's back in Sweden now and keeps bringing it up, joking (or maybe not?) saying, "Well maybe we shouldn't disappoint them." I LOVE it, but it's just that I live over here, although on the bright side, we are the types to have long relationships instead of short flings here and there.      If things continue this way (and you were in my position), would you go for it after graduating from college? It's hard to say now what'll happen, but it seems that every time we see eachother after months of not seeing eachother, our relationship grows stronger and we talk every day in between, and still have the same kind of connection. I don't know, I guess I just want other people's opinions, what would YOU do? I'm curious.      Oh and not to mention his family has SAID they prefer me over anyone else because they know me well and I fit in with their family so well. I love them :) And my best friends usually have something negative to say about the guy I'm "with" but this time it's the oposite.      I don't know. What would you do? :)
20090303224011AAaUvNY	Family & Relationships;Family	I have quite a problem...?	My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 7 months. The problem is, is that my mother has no idea.      Im 18 years old, a college freshman but I barely have any freedom.      My mother is very strict and very old fashioned when it comes to a lot of things.      I don't have my own car, yet I commute to school everyday because she would not allow me to live on campus.  I don't mind living at home but I think it would be better if I had a car so that I don't have to depend on someone else to always have to be transporting me.      Also, my mother doesn't really want me to date.  Although I am at that age where I could technically do what I want, because I live under her roof and I do not have my own car, my freedom is limited.      My boyfriend and I are always having to sneak around to see each other and it gets tiring.  My mom knows of him but she doesn't know that we are dating.      Basically, my problem is, is that my boyfriend is getting a little tired of having to sneak around just to see me and he doesn't know how much longer he can take it.      Ive continuously tried to get my mom to be okay with the whole idea but she refuses to be open about it.      I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel so stifled and suffocated.
20090303224656AAZUVsM	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm 22 years old and I have guardianship of my almost seven year old niece.?	I'm 22 years old and I have guardianship of my almost seven year old niece. Both of "Alexa's" parents are pretty much non active in her life. Her mother who just turned 21 was some random girl my brother hooked up with and is now living her life in another state. My brother is your typical non active father to his first 3 kids. Now the problem is my mom will ignore his bad behavior and reward the little things that he does such as a two min phone call on Alexa's birthday. Now when it comes to my relationship with my mom. It's pretty much her telling me I'm never doing a good enough job because of stupid pitiful reasons like how I don't allow Alexa to eat candy whenever she wants. I'm single and I work 50hrs/wk and am raising Alexa the best that I can. Now the question is what should I do about my mother?????

We have a 10 yr old son together.        When we broke up, she moved out as she cheated on me.  I still am having a hard time getting over her and we have talked about reconciliation, although I highly doubt the problems can be resolved.        My problem is we have our son 50/50, because of our work schedules.  It actually works out pretty good for us both financially and we both get our son equally.         I am having trouble feeling those "what if" or "if only things would work out", running through my head.  How can I make it so I don't see her but yet keep things going with the boy, but me not feeling like I still wanting her.      I have always had a strong emotional tie to her and its hard when seeing her, and not either wanting to be with her or close to her.  She still has that power over me.  How do you get over that?      Yes, I know  she cheated on me, but when I take my son over or she comes here and drops him off, we are still friends.  I want to be friends with her , if nothing else for the sake of the boy, but how can I separate my feelings for her, and be nothing more than friends and still be able to move on?
20090304075719AALmPAV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please help, I feel that I am betraying my friend what should I do?	Hi      I have been good friends with this girl for a few years, we get on well and we are part of the same group of friends at college. We have this guy in our friendship group (she has known him for about 6 months I have known him for about 7 years but we have never been friends until now)      They have a really weird relationship where she says they are more than friends but he is always meeting up with other girls and ex girlfriends.   Whenever I talk to him outside college or we have conversations without her there I always feel as if I am going behind her back. She has told him how she feels about him but he hasn't really done anything about it.      She makes me feel guilty that I am also friends with him and makes me feel as if her relationship with him is so much more important etc      What should I do? I feel guilty just texting him even though we are just friends. Is this friendship with this guy wrong?      Thanks xxxx
20090304072534AAUuP0i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell my husband I am arguing with him on purpose?	Don't get me wrong, I love my husband. The problem is I feel bored and lonely.        I have alot more energy then he does and because of my job we have different schedules and sleep at different times.  We sleep in separate rooms so we don't wake each other.  I spend most of my time alone in the middle of the night and on the computer.      When we do get to be together we usually have fun and we do things we both enjoy.  As soon as he wants to go to sleep I get really panicky.  I dread all the time I have to spend alone.      This is when I usually start arguments with him.  Really, I just want him to stay with me.  Sometimes I do things I know he hates just so he can lecture me.  Lately, he has tried to stop arguing by just going to sleep, so I follow him and force him to stay awake by yelling at him.        He is so sad lately and sometimes he cries.  I'm scared to talk to him about this because he may think I'm crazy.  I don't know how to stop.

20090304073545AAu9sWz	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Unhappy marriage, what would you do?	ive been married 3 years , but been living together 6 years.   about 2 years ago my husband cheated on me. it broke my heart and totally ruined my feelings for him. I have small kids and he "confessed" to me of having an affair, i was blissfully unaware. he "confessed" cause he knew the girl was gonna tell me and he wanted to be first. the girl was a pyscho who because he no longer wanted to see her went berserk, stalking and even claiming she was pregnant. (she wasn't) my husband begged me to forgive him and give him just one more chance, and to think of the kids. then he kinda said it wasmy fault since we werent making love enough at home. i had a baby for goodness sake and depo made me loose my libido, so because we had been a month without sex he goes and cheats. long story short i forgave him and stayed. he has seen been saved and has become  religious and boring, although im sure he is not cheating and has been trying to be good with the kids. i am no longer attracted to him or love him like i did before the cheating. for some reason when he kisses me i feel nauseaos and when he touches me it bothers me. he is lazy talks rude to me and loves his church more than me, and i wish he would change. why cant he be more romantic and fun. i hate the fact that hes turned into a fundie. i feel sad and stuck. i find myself wishing i could find my soul mate, but i dont want to break my family apart. im trying so hard to save this marriage.   what would you do?   would you stay?   have any advice?   my kids are 3 and 5.   thanks

20090304073929AARxM50	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why is he behaving like this with me?	I dont even know this guy, just seen him in the nieghbourhood sometimes.   First he messed with me by calling me some name (he shouted out aloud WITCH when i was walking by even though i have had no social intercation with him)., then when i saw him again he went by walking saying 'sorry' and i was like 'eff off' and then he kept on looking at me and walking away and then i show him the middle finger and he sees that does nothing, walked away. Then again when i was out at night he came walking with his friends (even though he lives a little away) and then his friends were looking at me and he said "don't look don't look" to them and i again flipped the bird and talked a lot of abuses, but he kept on walking and didn't even abuse me back or something. then the next day he was like with his friends a little away from my house and i noticed taht all his friends were like pushing him towards my direction and he was like moving back and they were like pushing him toward my direction and doing this laughingly?!      So what the **** is wrong with this guy, i don't get it? and not that i look like a witch or something cause m a pretty girl and many of his friends have the hots for me though but i don't know what the hell is up with this guy.      is he just a troublemaker

He's the drummer in my band at college and we've gotten on well, but I take offense when he says "gimme a smile jimmyyy" or "james m8 ur so f*ckin' stiff".      I despise the way I am. I can't help it. I suffer Social Anxiety as well as likely other disorders (like if there's one with the urge to lash out and kill anyone who mocks me for my problems because they're so embarassing, though no one has done this before except him).      How should I take it up with him? Should I just assertively say "You know, I do take offense when you talk to me like that". And if he disrespects further I'll just ask him to take it outside with me.

However, I want our honeymoon to be scenic, memorable, special and romantic.  I don't know where we should go, and we've been trying to decide on a destination for several months.

20090227061923AAmhA3S	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So whats up with this....?	so I am doing an internship at a school, and there is this teacher who is 5 yrs older than me. I been doing that internship since August last year. However, my supervisor brought another intern at the beginning of this year. So, this teacher, is cute, but I dont know if he likes me! The other intern was doing a psychosocial for one of his students and he told he a lot about himself, such as his age, where he lives, and emphasized that he lives in a good neighborhood. He even described his parent's professions! Now my question is, did he tell that intern all that information because he wanted her to tell me? Maybe he does not know how to approach me, since I've never given him signs of interest. I DO NOT think that he is into the other intern, Im not going to say why but i know its not that way, besides shes married and is a lesbian.... he woudnt get in trouble if we started dating, because i am NOT his intern nor his student.....so whatcha think

20090304073902AAzVtfn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I'm still hurting and I don't know how to stop..?	I got divorced three years ago. As soon as I separated I found myself in another relationship which helped me tremendously but we ended up hurting each other. We were together after my divorce was final, we were talking marriage but lots of things happened between us and he and I couldn't see eye to eye... there were lies and misscommunication. I ended it. I met another person who was getting out of a marriage and he and I started as friends and he quickly wanted to move on to something more intimate. Once i finally agreed i found myself torn in between knowing his state of mind and trying to help him and my feelings for him, which were growing uncontrolled. I became too attached and though I think he cared about me he wasn't ready; however, he's the type to play mental games and he kept me teethering on the edge, specially every time i wanted to leave because i was getting too close and starting to hurt myself. Every time I left he went after me. We were together all the time and almost living together but he would not open up to me and it was driving me insane.   I ended up leaving and it was lots of drama him crying me running. It was very emotional, i don't know how real it was, but it hurt like hell then.   We saw each other while separated and ended up sleeping together a couple of times. I was addicted to him and who knows what it was for him. Anyways, I became pregnant. I was on the pill, i have all kinds of medical issues for which i shouldn't have had children but the miracle was done and i was. He thought the worst of it.   He dumped me, then he came back to do it again, and ended up coming back to tell me he was going to take care of the kid but he didn't want anything to do with me.   i was devastated. I still allowed him to be participant of the pregnancy and at times he seemed more caring than others, but never a definite interest, or at least i wouldn't give him credit for it. He was too wishy washy, playing games again, and doing a dance. It was too much for my psyche to handle. I shut down and when he seemed to be really interested I didn't act. I was paralyzed by fear.   Then she came into our lives and he told me that he couldn't take care of her. He would visit maybe once a week, never for more than 3 hours. He wouldn't help any other way. He would tell me of his comings and goings and I wondered how if he's broke he can do all these things. I felt he was using me. When i called him on it his attitude was almost aggressive and since I had gone through something similar with my ex husband all of those bad memories came back rushing. I snapped and went after him. I have never lost it in my life before. I'm only human. He broke all communication with the kid.   I was being pressured by every body to take him to court, to force him, my mental state was weak and I accepted doing it. I really don't need the money and had he gone about it a different way i would've helped him, but now i feel like in the middle of a battle where i always loose. he has shown no interest or love for her for the last 5 almost 6 months.   i still love him, but i know there's nothing that will make him come back to us, and maybe it's for the better. idk.   I am finding myself consumed by all these events and i can't seem to let go and move on. I'm starting to feel weighed down. I sometimes want to talk to him, but i don't want him to hurt me again. I was told that when asked about me he refer to me as another crazy *****...   i'm seriously hurt here and time is not enough to work this thing.   I'm talking to a counselor, but i can't help to feel that i missed my timing and so my daughter will not have her father at home as she deserved.   I don't know what to do. I feel powerless here.

I do get on with my mother-in-law but this kind of stuff is quite irritating... she does it infront of my sister-in-laws or husband and i can't say anything...      even my sister-in-law said ive put on a lot of weight but i can't see how going from 8 stone to 8.5 stone means i'm massive!!!!!!!!!!
20090304074039AAiwuX0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is he shy? he likes me as a friend or more? is it love?	He's single      -He slipped his hand on my arm      -When we had a vacation, I told him that i'll miss him, he whispered me too      -He smiles whenever he sees me      -He looked at me , it was showing that his eyes were smiling      -One my friend went and gave him something, he didn't do anything    but when she told him that's its from me, he smiled an ear to ear smile      -It was like a party, i was looking at him and when he looks at me I look down and vice versa[ when i catch him looking at me he looks down]      -When he caught me staring at him, he smiled an ear to ear smile      -He asked me if I was in the mall with a group of my friends[ we got seperated afterwards in the mall] I told him ya, he told me I felt that you were there.   I asked him if he's coming today to the mall he told me he doesn't think he can make it, i told him you have to come[ in a joking way] he smiled then he told me i'll see.      he also raised and lowered his eyebrow toward me although i didn't know what he meant      i was in the car and he was on the sidewalk, i lowered the window and smiled and he smiled back and when the car pulled off, he looked back at it. i always smile at him and he smiles back.   The next day he talked to me about it, he told me I saw you in the car      he's so sweet, if we're both next to a door for example. he'll always let me pass first, he doesn't move until i pass first      ?
20090304081631AAFDuZU	Family & Relationships;Friends	A not funny joke, and a belittling me?	Okay so my "bestfriends" decided to to tell me that one of my best friends, Mary hooked up with our other bestfriends boyfriend Dema. So i panicked and had to tell Erin because it was the right thing to do, and Dema and mary were begging me not to tell, and then as soon as i did, erin was like "we were just screwing with you" HAHAHA.       It wasnt funny, the situation caused me alot of stress and pain.       Then because i got mad, Erin tells me that im never there for her, i only use her to smoke weed, i never hang out, etc all negative things that arent true.       So now im iffy with Mary and Dema and im not talking to erin at all becos of the horrible things she said.      What is your opinion?

20090304073008AA7kgel	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Serious advice only please..... re marriage?	OK, so here goes nothin.... we've been married for almost 13 years now, and ever since we got pregnant 4 years ago, our sex life went kaput.  I've tried the talk about it angle....no use.  Tried lots of things.  Am finding that the "little things" work best.  Heard many times that if you throw the bomb, its usually a bomb. So ladies - what little things can a man do to make u feel special, wanted, loved, etc.  Its not all about the sex, but that would help too.  I think if I can get past the relationship renovation first, that the sex life will follow thereafter.  Am I spinning my wheels? Talk to me.....

Started over fresh with one of my ex boyfriends and we have only been back together for 1 week and a few days We have sexual intercourse, a lot.

20090304074134AA63p8u	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Need advice on sister in law whose husband is a cheater- what to do with my family?	I am writing because I am so confused on how to deal with my inlaws and more importantly, my sister in law, and I need help on how to deal with this.      My sister in law was married for 5 years this past May when her husband came in a said he wanted a divorce, no counseling, nothing, he was leaving, taking the big screen, and gone.  He would come over in the morning while she was at work and take their child to day care, he would mow the grass.  A week later we found out he had been having an affair.  In the mean time, he is still coming over and sleeping with my sister in law.  My mother and father in law, immediately get a lawyer, and it finally took about 6 months for a separation to be drawn up, and they signed their papers.      In the mean time, my soon to be ex brother in law, has not cut the grass like he promised, and has been caught going through my sister in laws financial documents and her house in general.  She makes excuses at why we tell her not to let him in her house, but she continues to say that she needs the help for her daughter in the am since she has to be at work at 6 45, and daycare doesnt open until 7.      Anyways, alittle history about this man: he is 30, this is his second marriage- apparently his 1st wife cheated....  not sure I buy this: his has been discharged from the military-not sure why or his status: his was sexually molested by his father as a child, no counseling: he has openly cheated on my sister in law, not sure how many times: his general demeanor is rude: hes rude to my family on many many occasions: and during my wedding, all the girls went to get their hair and make up done and he was ticked off because she was gone all day and she couldnt go sight see with him, so she owed him a "sexual favor"- if you get my drift...      This past month he told her she needed to get on with her life.  She needed to go online to a dating site and meet someone.  She did!  A NICE man with a big family a little girl the same age, he owned his own business, and she actually spent the night with him.  We were ecstatistc!!!!!  Then their grandfather died, a huge emotional stress.  The soon to be ex, came back in telling her she was moving too fast, he wanted to work things out, he broke it off with the ex girlfriend.  All of this within a few days and she took him back.        In the mean time we have supported her financially to get away from this guy, we have gone above and beyond doing everything in our power to help her see the light.  But now the kicker- hes seen God.  Satan had been in his heart.        Its like hes brainwashed her.  Its like shes in a cult!  I mean its so convenient to use God as an excuse!  I think its Devil making them think its God... I mean I dont understand this.      My husband and I said we wouldnt ostracize her or her child (with him), but at this time, we are so sickened and unable to deal with the heartache anymore.  Its unfair to us.  Weve spent so many nights unable to sleep, and watch their parents cry, and worry, and weep.  Its sickening.  I feel bad for removing her from my life, however, I am unable to take the physical effects this is having on my own body.  Really, I am.  I cant sleep, and I also suffer from anxiety- the type when your hearts beating so fast, and you dare someone to speak out of line to you in that moment like your going to fly off the deep end.      My husband, who is a counselor for drug abusers, wrote her the nicest letter, that took him 4 hours to write, and said the things we will or will not do, and that was we will not support her.      I can feel that my husband and I could have strong disagreements and harm our own marriage because of this, so we are choosing to go on with our lives without her, and if so, our niece, because we refuse to allow this man who has treated us with the utmost disrespect to be in our presence.  I dont even care about the disrespect he has caused her, but he will not talk to me or my husband in inapproriate ways.      I come from a family where you mess with me, my dad is coming after you.  Their family keeps taking the disrespect of slamming doors in his mothers face, and then welcomes him the following weekend to their dinner table.  It is the christian thing for them to do, and thats what they want.      Can anyone give me advice on this issue.  I feel so stuck.

20090304074400AAaEDem	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have this friend online and can someone please tell me if I should trust him or not?	Okay so I have this friend I met on facebook and I gave him my email because we have the same last name...and he told me he wants to see me (I saw him and he opened his camera either) but I don't have any cameras so I just told him when he'll come to my town he'll see me (he lives in another town but his grandma lives in mine and her house is close to mine either).    So he said he'll see me on March 21st [Mother's Day] and he talks about waiting for that day everytime I talk to him and I think he doesn't have feelings for me so how is this supposed to happen?    Is he doing something bad? or does he REALLY have feelings for me?   should I meet him or not? (we're indeed relatives btw)   PLEASE HELP!!
20090304073129AAq6YgS	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I stupid or petty for feeling this way?	I have been with my boyfriend for almost 3 years. We have talked about getting married and we do plan on it, we just don't have money right now for rings and everything that goes with paying for a wedding. Well, my boyfriend's sister is currently engaged and they have only been together a little over a year and a half. They're not better off financially than we are, they just made it work...by putting her ring on layaway at a jewelry store and paying for everything a bit at a time, etc. I am very happy for them. But I also find myself feeling a bit jealous of them too. I don't like feeling jealous,  but I do. Am I being stupid or petty for feeling jealous?       Also, on an unrelated note. My boyfriend's other sister got married last year, his cousin was married the year before. And his sister mentioned above is getting married later this year. I understand that I'm not officially part of the family, but I am pretty close with most of the women in his family. His sisters and his cousins. I was not asked to be a part in any of the weddings. I understand that it's their wedding, it's their choice...but I was a tad bit offended. I know that being offended for that really is stupid and petty. But I was even more so offended when I was invited to the bridal showers, but not the bachlerette (sp?) party. At first I didn't know if only the bridal party usually goes to that so I didn't take it personally...but a ton of the brides friend's went. So I felt like I was invited to the shower just so she could get more presents when she didn't even want me to be with her to celebrate. I know this is all so petty and it shouldn't be about me at all. But it's how I feel. I'm even closer to the sister getting married this year than I am with the sister that got married last year and she didn't ask me to be in the wedding at all either. So my question is...when my bf and I do get married, would it be incredibly petty and bitchy of me to not have any of them in my wedding? Even though I don't have many female friends that I'm close enough to warrant asking them to be in my wedding. I know it's a bitchy move, but I don't want people in my wedding who wouldn't want me in theirs.

20090304073050AAaaWyb	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I leave?  My wife is insisting that her son move back in with us.?	My wife has 4 boys.  I have no children of my own.  The oldest has now been asked to leave this house on 2 occasions.  The first time he went with his dead-beat dad and his wife.  He eventually overstayed his welcome there and was kicked out.  When he came back with us, he began racking up DUIs and other problems.  He eventually got a DUI while driving with no license.    There were many shouting matches, including several where he screamed things like "you *****" to his own Mother.  I finally took matters into my own hands and made him leave (backed up by a phone call to the Police).  This was about 9 months ago.  His dad then left his wife and got an apartment and took in the son. Since, his dad left for back east, paying some of his bills.  He has since cleaned up his act mostly, yet has no job.  I found out that my wife had been being dishonest with me by paying some of his bills; groceries, etc. and bought him a bike and a bus pass, as well as allowed him as a "family member" in our gym.  This was very hard to take: that she had been lying to me about this.      Anyway, now the rent has run out, he still has no job, refuses to consider the military, and she wants him to move back in with us.  If he does, I am very seriously considering moving out.  I cannot live with that for a single day longer.  He still has the same personality, though he has made some strides for improvement.  I cannot state clearly enough how uncomfortable it is around him, and how immature he still has been when visiting (picking fights with the brothers, etc.).        Your opinion?

20090304074127AAjEbHy	Family & Relationships;Weddings	I need some serious relationship help!?	I was dating the same guy for over a year...and on Dec. 27th he proposed to me. About a week and a half ago I found out that he had been cheating on me. He claimed he was at a work meeting, but answerd his phone by mistake and I heard a girl and him talking about things that just friends wouldn't be talking about. After he found out that I caught him he told me that he just needed "time to himself". I was CRUSHED because we have started making wedding plans and I couldn't understand how someone who loved me would do something like that.      Since then we haven't talked but a couple time throughout text messaging. Most of them were just fighting...I have been strong and have not once text him first since we have broken up. This morning he text me (it was the first time in about 4 days that I've heard anything from him) saying this:       "Just so you know when we were out of town with your cousins she tried to sleep with me, but i said no because I was being true to you and I loved you"      I KNOW he is lying... my cousin would never do that to me...      I just don't understand? What kind of point is he trying to make to me? Is he shocked that I haven't been begging him back so now he is trying to find a reason to talk to me??      I don't want him back, and I fully plan to move on. Of course I am still heartbroken, but I would never get back with a liar. I just want understanding!      Thanks.

Hi,   Am frm chennai.. working in wipro.. i hav a friend who also works in the same organzation.. We were too close friends for atleast three months..

20090304073325AAXY17I	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my wife take my daugther to another state?	Ok, this situation is a little complicated.  First, there was an incident in which my wife got a restraining order against me.  Well, since we realized we want to work things out not only for the babies sake but, because we still love each other.  She moved to New Mexico to live with her mom until we get on our feet.  I was laid off my job and now am slowly catching back up.  I don't know if I'll be able to move her back soon, but I'm afraid of her establishing residency in that state with my daughter.  I don't want to file a divorce but, I would assume that this is the only way to ensure my daughter is a part of my life.  If she really wants to be with me then the divorce shouldn't matter I would think.  I have been trying to avoid divorce but, I'm young and I'm still trying to figure things out.  If there are any parents that may have gone through this same thing I would like to know.  I brought this up to her but, she just gets upset.  Should I just go ahead and go through with the divorce or wait a little bit and see how things go.  She swears that our daughter will always be a part of my life.  But, being that she was never on good terms with her parents and now all of a sudden has them involved in her life.  They want my parental rights taken away and never likedthe idea of me being married to my wife.  I'm wondering if I should just explain this to my wife and see if maybe we can geta legal seperation instead and then get re-married once were back on our feet.  And, at least I'll feel more comfortable knowing that my daughter will for sure be in my life.

She claims she saw him at the store while shopping about 2-3 weeks ago they exchanged. They have been texting and emailing. I know he asked her out to lunch, not sure if they ever went.

20090227061453AA8M2k9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I good enough for her?	There is this girl who I really like in college but the thing is that I kept thinking to myself that I don't deserve her because she is perfect(hardworking, smart, cute, pretty and etc.) and me being a lazy asshole. She is going to the one of the best uni in UK which is very far from where I will be and I am going to a not so good uni(which some people think is a **** place) because of my shitty grades. I got a friend who told that girls are more attracted to smart guys and I am not one of them but I do think I have a smart and good personality which is not related to education. This is one of the main reasons why I never had the confidence to get any girl who I liked because i just kept thinking what will the girl think of me because of my grades which is not entirely good and me being lazy. Anyway, I do chat with her on MSN which is going smoothly and the college courses will be finishing in 3 months time, she will be gone by then. So should I go for her or just walk away like what I always do........      PS. I really want to know what to do...I'm getting desperate...

20090304094030AASvbWC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my ex get visitation rights? Custody...?	Okay I previously asked if he can request DNA w/o him being on the Birth Certificate, and unfortunately got that answer! . Now i'm wondering if they would give him visitation rights..? Custody? The reason I ask if because He's a drug addict... He has no stable income, and any income he has goes straight to drugs. He's deeply in... and that's why I've left him.. I've tried to help him and he was clean for 6+ months. that's when we decided to have this baby, and sure enough, the moment I got pregnant, he started again. So now I'm leaving him. Would I have to prove to the courts that he's unfit? And I make more income than him so if he did get custody of any sort, woudl I have to pay him???
20090304083508AAT51Sy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do if your husband didn't give you the birthday present he'd offered because he was in a mood?	On my birthday I had lots of lovely presents including an Armani watch and a lovely bunch of flowers from my husband.  On a card he'd also said that he'd booked us into a weekend at a spa.  It turned out that the date he'd booked - last weekend - I couldn't do.  So he was going to book into another one for this weekend coming.  However, he's since fallen out with me since Sunday (though I'm not sure why) and has said he's not taking me.  I think this is really mean and I'm not sure how to react.  I've tried the softly, softly, come on you don't mean it approach and let's not be like this.  I can't rant and rave because that gets us nowhere and only upsets me and I'm not a sulker.  So what do I do?????? How will he know how much he's upset me?      The fall out was simply based on our kids. They kept talking over the top of him as they were excited and he asked them to stop.  They did it again and he took the p*ss out of my eldest going "nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah blah, blah, blah - why don't you just shut up".  Because up to that point we'd had a lovely weekend going to Warwick to visit a castle and going out for a curry, swimming etc - she burst into tears.  I said very calmly "oh come on, (husband's name) don't be like that" He then flew into a rage and hasn't spoken to be since.....except to call me names when I asked him what was wrong.      I hate it when it's like this.  Seems to be happening more and more often and yet on Saturday anyone watching us would have thought we were a perfect happy family.  He held my hand over coffee and was attentive and affectionate with the kids.  We've been together nearly 16 years and he still confuses the hell out of me.

20090304094114AAkEvMn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I stop worrying about my boyfriend being attracted to other women?	After my drunken prodding, my boyfriend admitted that sometimes when he sees a hot girl, he imagines himself having sex with her. He said that he can't really help it, that it's just a flash, and then he brushes it aside. I realize that I forced him to answer a very awkward question, and I appreciate his honesty, but I'm brokenhearted. I feel very insecure now when we go out in public together and we see a hot woman, because it makes me feel unattractive in comparison even though I know I'm good-looking.      Of course, I too admire other people's attractiveness, but I don't visualize myself having sex with them. That just doesn't interest me -- it's too intimate and why would I want to have random sex with someone ... you don't even know how clean they are.       Am I weird? Or are my boyfriend and I simply incompatible? If this is a normal thing that couples have to deal with, how can I deal with my feelings of insecurity and sadness?      Thank you.

20090304094653AA2d9pj	Family & Relationships;Family	Is Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny" too romantic a song to dedicate to one's twin sister?	My friend wants to dedicate a song to his twin sister. I couldn't think of any suggestions. What's a good song for a person who's always been by your side through everything?   He was thinking along the lines of Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny."   Will that do?   I mean, when people hear the word "destiny" they equate it with "soul mate." I told him I'm afraid it might make people think there are incestuous undertones to it.   Would that do for a brother-sister relationship? Katharine McPhee's "My Destiny," I mean.   Or maybe not?   My friends says he knows that, but he thinks it's the perfect song. He says he feels like it was his "destiny" to be her twin brother, and she his twin sister.   And he said that when he heard the line "how different life turned out to be," he thought to himself how different things would've been had they not grown up together, had he not known her, had she not been there for him through it all.   He says he couldn't imagine.   See, their parents are about to be divorced, and their dad is a drinker and a gambler. She's been there for him through all the drunk nights when father and son would fight.   And she would listen to him cry himself to sleep at night.   So he really wanted to dedicate something special for his sister. Should he go through with it?

20090227063343AAjLpCD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Rocky relationship turned wonderful... How would you feel?	I have been with my fiance for several years now. When we met we were still letting go of ex boy/girlfriend and it wasn't serious. We considered ourselves "just having fun" in the beginning. After he asked me to marry him we found out I was pregnant and because we have such big families decided to put the wedding on hold until we could afford it. My problem is I have a hard time letting go of the past and when we first met I knew other things were going on with other girls. We technically weren't "together" we had just met, but I still feel betrayed in a way. Our relationship is amazing now. I love going home to my family and my fiance is literally the best dad I have ever come across. He takes care of us and cares more for us than anything in the world. Is the past something I just need to let go at this point? Why am I holding on to those negative thoughts of our early days?

20090304082727AAV8L1w	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do you handle friends who are unstable & always end up fighting w/you?	I had these types of friends my whole life. Everything starts of well, but there's always drama from their end, and it always ends up leading into a "well maybe we should not be friends anymore thing," and it's just been absolutely insane and crazy with people like tihs my whole life.      Recently I had yet another friend of over 6 years get into an argument with me because I accused him of possibly lying on something. I asked flat out, "is there any chance that you were misleading me on this?" and he flippedo ut saying, "how could you after 6 years how could youuuuuuuuuuu." and I"m like "wow calm down, ...I just got kinda curious thats all." I mean...hell..if you suspect something may be wrong you bring it up maturely,but he totally flippedo ut at me, sent me nasty dramatic ims/emails, deleted his account immediatelly after that, and I mean...was just over the top over a simple COMMENT.      Which leads me to believe that this person is totally unstable, so we're not friends anymore now over THAT.            How do you handle people who are unstable, unpredictable, drama prone, especially if they're friends?          Should you just always cut these people from your life and stay true to yourself?

20090227064344AAZCstT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can I do when my ex-husband's gf is a big obstacle in our communication?	I'm divorced from the my son's father... he cheated, was abusive, and finally he walked out... I'm the one that filed for divorce.      He's still with the girl he last cheated on me with, and they are having a child (he cheated a little over a year ago) within the next few weeks.      My problem is that my ex-husband's girlfriend is a real problem for my ex and I to communicate. I can't call over at their place if there is something with our son because apparently she said she'd put charges on me for harassment (I've never talked to her!!!), etc... And I've never contacted him on anything other than our child. So I have to call him at work if there's something.      The latest problem was that our son was having some health troubles, and the doctor finally gave him a few different meds to help out... after the doctor's appointment, I went by his work to see him (his shift was over, he was walking to his car) and asked him to come to the pharmacy with us to get the information directly from the pharmacist on how to give the meds (he's the type who'd say I didn't tell him something when I did, to say I gave him bad instructions, etc.). Well, his girlfriend apparently threw a fit and then HE started throwing a fit on me after that, telling me I ruined his life, etc.       I'm trying to do some coparenting, even though it's hard, and even though I have sole custody, I still try to involve him, but all I get is threats from his gf, through him and other people, and false accusations. She's even started saying that she's having pregnancy trouble because of stress related to me because I harassed her (I never talked, or emailed her.. I did email my ex once, telling him to stop hitting on me, flirting with me or trying to kiss me, and she saw it and sent it to herself and then claimed I had sent it to her...she's nuts), that I'm a bad mom, etc.. we live in a small town, so all the lies are kinda hard to swallow, we know the same people...      How in the world can I communicate with my ex, when his girlfriend keeps trying to come between us? I don't want him back, hey, she wanted him, she can very well keep him, I deserve (and have) a better man than that. I've tried talking to him about it, but it doesn't seem to help...      My son is not even two yet, so he doesn't understand yet... but still. My son deserves that his parents can communicate together, and I don't think I should have to put her needs into consideration, SHE didn't make that child, and she doesn't want to be his step-mom (won't watch him if it's his weekend and there's an emergency, etc.). I'm about to give up on communicating with my ex, his gf is making it too damn hard... Once, he came over to my office to talk (about our divorce, we were filling out papers, talking about wills, organ donation, etc). She called 45 times in 1.5 hours.       How can I communicate with my ex-husband when it comes to our son when she's making it impossible? Any ideas? Even HE wants to communicate, and calls me when he gets the chance and she's nt near... But I don't feel we should have to hide it. And with all she's said and done, I don't want to include her in our conversation, it should strictly be between me and him, it's our son!      So.. communication tips? ideas?    BTW... she was like this BEFORE she got pregnant. It's not the hormones, she's just a witch with a B naturally apparently!

20090227062909AAJ9vr4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to deal with husband who won't help at home?	In an effort to deal with my growing feelings of resentment against my husband, I attempted a new approach. Typically I just bottle my anger up inside me and fume in silence letting it eat away at me. I also discovered that I expect my husband to read my mind and think that he should just "know" what to do - e.g. When I'm bringing in the groceries, he can come and help me carry them. When I've just made a big meal of his favorite foods that I worked long at preparing and the kitchen is a mess, he could offer to help clean up instead of mysteriously disappear.       Anyway, my resentment is showing again in those comments, I know, so let me get to the point. I went out on a limb and I kindly and politely asked him if he could regularly help me in the kitchen by emptying the dishwasher. I thought that was a very small task that would actually help me out immensely. I said that I would continue picking up the groceries, making the meals, rinsing the dishes after the meal and putting them in the dishwasher. He laughed through out my request and then came out and said "no, but I'll think about it over the next six months or so". Then he managed to turn the tables like usual and make me feel bad for even asking.       Today I am absolutely fuming inside. He just doesn't take me seriously at all. I thought my request was quite reasonable, you know. I would still be doing the majority of the work but at least I would feel like we're working somewhat as a team. I do so many things for him, more out of obligation because we're married rather than actually wanting to do them. Some of his behavior is quite rude and getting worse. If he has garbage, he hands it to me to throw out. If I'm working on something and he needs something, he never asks, he just gives me a command. There is never any please or thank you for anything I do but when he does something for me, I am always polite and thank him because I want to try to model how he could respond to me.       One time years agao I did have enough and I completely blew up at him. I thought that this would come as a huge wake up call for him because that is totally out of character for me. It didn't even phase him, in fact, he told me to "f-ing shut up." I said "do you know who you're speaking to? That was way over the line." Then he was quiet and was all nicey-nicey talking to me but never ever apologized for what he said, but I did because it was eating away at me for what I had said. I told him that I shouldn't have spoken like that and I was sorry it had happened because that was not how I'd been raised.        Anyway, I'm digressing and dredging up all these old situations that cause my blood to boil. Can someone give me some advice on this? Don't I deserve more than this inconsideration? I have tried leaving the housework, not cooking etc. etc. I just doesn't phase him and nothing gets done because he won't pick up the responsibility. So in the end it causes me more work because I'm the one who eventually has to deal with it all.
20090304094619AA0z9pq	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ugh, my fiancees parents are already starting to get on my nerves, how do I get them off our backs?	Well I met my now fiancee when I was 14 and he was 16 and have been together ever since so it has been about 5 years now. We are both in college, he is in his 3rd year and I am in my first. Well his parents are going to rent their house out to what was suppose to be US and that was fine, I would pay rent and we would live together so, great. Well now that his parents are really moving out (in may) they told him I am not even allowed to stay there, they actually don't approve of him living with me until he graduates!? Ugh, so now these plans are not going to go through and we cannot afford $1000 a month on rent in our area so our current situation is as is but I feel like I can do nothing to please these people, my mom is pushing for wedding bells and his want me to stay as far away from him as possible. How do I avoid this in the future with other things, such as our wedding and having children? What should I do or say?
20090304082718AA7bkCd	Family & Relationships;Family	If my Dad does not respect me is it alright to not respect him?	Ever since he married this lady who took everything he had he stands up for her when I stand up for him. So I guess we just dont talk anymore. 10 years ago he married her after my Mom died. She took all of our keys from us. She took my Dad and just locked us out of his life so she could  take control. What happens when he has no money left? then What will she do? Scary.
20090304092054AAgfZ1R	Family & Relationships;Family	Husband made "other plans" for anniversary?	My husband of 5yrs told me that he wants to go out and hang with the guys drinking on Friday, and Saturday is UFC fight night and he is having three guys over to watch the fights and party. Our 5yr wedding anniversary is Friday. I am thinking about making plans with a girlfriend because I do not want to spend my wedding anniversary waiting for him to come home drunk after midnight. I think I deserve better. Last weekend sucked, too, UFC fights on Friday and Saturday he went out with his friends. I'm really sad but I don't want to fight with him. Should I just make my own plans and let him do his thing? It just hurts after five years to be forgotten like this.      I don't feel like it is my place to remind him it's our anniversary. Either he remembers it or he soesn't.... he's a grown man, he knows what month it is. To me that would make me look pushy and demanding. If the date does not move him to want to do something special or even move him to make an effort to remember it, I don't think that should be my problem. Like, "Honey, tomorrow's Christmas!" It's just too silly, I don't think I can do that.

But I really really want to TRY and "reconnect" (not that we ever connect other than her giving me my first nickname).  I was in love with this chick.  Am i setting myself up for failure?  should i even bother?

20090304082419AASd1Wx	Family & Relationships;Friends	How can I stand up to my controlling friend?	-She talks crap behind everyone's back, but is the sweetest thing to them to their face. I thought she liked me until someone told me recently she does the same to me. She apparently thinks it's annoying if I call her to hang out, yet she tells everyone I'm her best friend!      -When we hang out and I'm driving, she says "Oh by the way, I need to go to this store, this store, etc, etc..is that okay?" If I refuse, she makes me feel bad. When I had to go to just ONE store on the same trip, she said "Just make sure you hurry". But I was the one driving her around to four different places!      -She is always tries to tell me what to do, and I always give in for some reason! She's so manipulative. One time I overdrank at a party with her and passed out and she left me in the bathroom and didn't try to help me at all. Then she went back home that night and left me at the party in some stranger's house and never picked me up the next morning.      -I want to know how to stand up to her and start calling some of the shots, only because I got paired with her this semester to do a project with her. So I have to be around her now. She always tries to slack off on the project, and she makes me drive her around everywhere when we have to get stuff for the project.       -How can I tell her we need to get down to business and tell her she needs to drive some days without being afraid to tell her?

20090304085203AAtJ4VF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My Boyfriends ex... trying to get back in his pants!?	I have been with my boyfriend for over 3 yrs now, we live together and i'm expecting our 1st baby. However at the beginning of our relationship he cheated on me...So we split up for a couple of months... in this time he saw her again a few times. He soon realised how much he messed up, he apologised and told me the truth about all that had gone on between them...Basically just sex. I decided to take him back because i thought we had a good thing, and i knew i still loved him even though he had cheated on me. Slowly i began to trust him again and eventually we moved in together. We have been very happy ever since and i got over it. However since this girl has found out i'm pregnant (which my boyfriend is ecstatic about) she has been getting in touch with him again. She will txt him to say she's selling her car...do u know anyone that wants to buy it? Or silly lil jokes... sometimes she will ring on withheld number and not say anything...(yes she is very immature!) My boyfriend has been honest about it all, shown me all the text's she's sent and has called her to tell her not to contact him. She hasn't got the message though. He can't change his number as it's his business line she rings.      What would you do in my situation? This ***** is really beginning to piss me off!      Thanks!

20090304094048AAxdyzs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My wife cheated and I'm devastated.  Do you agree this is fair in retaliation?	I recently had a sexual encounter with her daughter when she came home from college.  Before you jump down my throat, know that I found out my wife has been sleeping with our pastor for three years.  Anyway, her daughter has always flirted with me, but of course I always ignored it or removed myself from the situation.  I'm 46, my wife is 49, and her daughter is 19.  Me and the wife have been together for 7 years.  Anyway, me and my wife haven't been having sex much over the last three years and masturbation has become a regular thing for me.  I was in my room one evening this past December masturbating.  I thought I was home alone.  My step-daughter was home from school, but I thought she was out.  Anyway, in the middle of me masturbating, I heard my door opening slowly.  I looked up and my step-daughter gasped, embarrassed that I'd caught her watching.  Long story short, I asked her to come in and sit with me.  She gave me a masterful hand job(I came in about 3 minutes).  She said it was our secret.  I feel vindicated.

20090304094056AAIFbK3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some perspective on this. Help please!?	I don't really favour discussing personal problems but I need some help.   I have been in a relationship with this guy for almost 2 years now. I love him to bits and have never imagined my life without him. We used to live in the same city until 3 months ago. Until then, dealing with each other was a lot easier. I think we are great together, have lots of fun; are open with each other and discuss things. He understands me, is sensitive and loves me a lot. We both trust each other and he has been with me through tough times and dealt with me when I have been quite the painful person.    I am a difficult person to live with. I have anxiety issues, low frustration tolerance and suffer from adult ADHD which was diagnosed only 2 weeks back. Ever since I came to another city, things have gotten really tough. He started working and doesn't get time to talk to me. When he does, he is always irritated and sounds unhappy all the time. All my efforts go waste. I am unable to cheer him up or even have a decent conversation. We haven't laughed with each other in ages. I will be visiting him in a week but that is just for 10 days. After which communication would be a lot less because I'll be traveling. I don't think I can deal with this sometimes. It's difficult for me to hang onto this when all I can manage is 5 minutes of silence on the phone with him;once a week. I have fought really hard, but we don't seem to be part of each others lives anymore. All we do is fight or argue. I have tried talking to him about this but it all seems secondary to him when he is working so hard and is caught up with college and his family.    I know he still loves me, he makes an attempt but it's not enough.I can understand he's got other things on his plate but I feel like I've had more of a relationship with his phone than him. What should I do?   I'd appreciate answers from people who actually take the time to read this and understand what I'm going through. So spare me the smart *** comments and the wise cracks. Thanks!
20090304091337AAq6qhQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Give him space? and let him decide on this??? Over 21 please!!?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.

My boyfriend and i had a fight, and he walked up and left me in public, then i tried to make amends i offered to bring him dinner while he studied, however i guess he was in his exam so dint reply for 2 hours. I continuously called him but he was just acting very careless and rude. He hung up on me mid sentence. I called him once and he had his mouth full and said his mom was feeding him.  I over heard him saying "what is this crap, you expect me to eat this"      Later on, we were fighting and i said him talking to his mother like that was unattractive (disrespectful, hes 21 and his mom is feeding him while he lys in bed??? WTF? ) am i wrong to think thats unattractive??   the mommas boy thing is NOT attractive.      Well he said to me " DONT EVER ******* TALK ABOUT MY MOM LIKE THAT U *****, **** YOU"      that to me but a huge void in between us, we both say things we dont men when were mad but i think he crossed the line here. On top of everything hes muslim im white, he makes it very clear how he wants me to be like his mom be more modest, and he always goes on about how white people have no culture and how white people dont beleive in mairrage, and how his moms says white girls are sluts/ How does he think that makes me feel? Talk about respect?? then for him to say DONT ******* TALK ABOUT MY MOM, i wasnt insulting her, but he made it very obvious how he feels about me. Am i wrong should i get rid of him??

20090304092631AAeKlDw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please answer this...am i too picky when it comes to looking for love?	I've dated quite a few guys in the last couple of years...for some reason, I just haven't felt a connection with most of them.  The majority of them have been the pushy, clingy, desperate kind, and so that turns me off.  I also haven't been that attracted to most of them...and no, a guy doesn't have to be that good-looking to attract me, but the truth is, there have only been a handful of guys I've met that I've really felt a connection with.  I can't help how I feel, that's just the way it's been.  And of course, most of these guys I have felt a connection with either haven't felt the same way about me, or they do, but they've already got somebody.  I've tried lowering my standards and just settling in relationships with guys just because they're sweet, even though I'm not that romantically interested in them or attracted to them, trying to make myself like them for being nice guys...but it never works out because my heart's not in it.  What can I do to be less picky?  Or have I just not met the right guy yet?

I have been married for 3 years, and recently she has been refusing to make me dinner, and always complains about how little I do. Just because she works 2 jobs, cleans the house, and takes care of grandma does not mean she doesn't have to cook me dinner. And my life isn't easy either. I have to make breakfast and lunch, which is really hard. At least I get to spend the rest of the day playing Call of Duty 4, but making 2 meals is more than enough work for anyone, I shouldn't be expected to make a third. How can I get her to stop complaining and just do it.

I'm disgusted because there's nothing wrong with husb, or marriage. I did it for selfish reasons, to win yet another man over,  for ego gratification, to be on a pedestal in someone's eyes again. I'm still in my 20s and have occasional self-esteem problems (sometimes I need others approval uneccessarily), which explains this affair. There have not been other men and I'm afraid of "once a cheater, always a cheater" .How can I control myself in the future, if I get away with it once? How can prevent being weak in the future if I meet another man who starts adoring me?        That's what happened,I took a risk for the sake of adventure, I felt adored, and I broke a pure marriage by giving myself to this other man. Like a dirty skank. I know. I feel like sh*t.      After several months of the affair, I have finally admitted to myself what I have done. I have been justifying it and calling it other names up until now, names other than "cheating".  It is what it is. I made a mistake. What I did does not define me, that's why I feel really awful. I haven't allowed myself to feel guilt until now.       I cannot admit to anyone about it. But I need to do something good....after everything. What do I do now?

20090304083351AA9gN1n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why do i feel such a failure?	I have been with my wife 8 years and can’t understand why after all I do for her   I’m left feeling crap and yet guilty Tracy has three children from her previous marriage   1 girl 2 grown boys 18 and 22 its been a hard 8 years as a husband constantly trying to please her to avoid dismissal nothing is ever too much I cook I clean I work as an electrician during the day in the evening I am usually busy decorating or renovating our home at the weekend I always make time for us to go out for a meal together somewhere nice. I’m patient and kind to her and the children and despite all this   All she ever dose is want more attention focused on her she like to control its done her way or we argue I feel so deflated and when I try to tell   Her how I feel and this is about a partnership she just puts me down she just turns the table and says what about me she really has nothing   To complain about she has a husband that dotes on her and she only works part time her two boys are really the icing on the cake right now   On a regular basis they are constantly in trouble with the police   Possession of drugs, fighting drinking driving under the influence of drugs and drink without a driving licence we have drug dealers demanding money   From us at our home which they had on credit the list goes on calls at 2 am from the police they also smash the home up when they cant have money they don’t work when I try and put my foot down about there dysfunctional behaviour and that this behaviour is unacceptable and that they need help and that it is driving a wedge between me and there mother and making matters worst it falls on deaf ears   Its really hard trying to stay focused on keeping the marriage together I want so much just to be normal loving family and a good loving wife like I love her   The problem is Tracy dose not see that for us to be happy these issues need to be addressed when I try to explain this is wrong what they are doing she tells me to shut up and don’t go on at them  leave them   Alone there her children. But I am sick of the upset and disruption every weekend and that it’s not healthy on our relationship. She then goes into one about something completely different trivial that I failed to do   And now she has sent me packing on a feeble excuse that the house never looks finished and she is fed up living with it yet our home is slowly beginning to look nice despite all what happens where have I gone wrong with this woman and why do I feel a failure
20090304085926AAuKyFN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I tell my friends I'm moving out?	I currently live in a shared house that is owned by 2 of my best friends, 1 of whom lives there with me, the other who moved out almost a year ago. However, my boyfriend and I have decided that we want to get our own place and so now I have the task of telling my friends that I want to move out. Which is not as easy as it seems! They have severe money problems with the house, not helped by the fact that our other housemate moved out just after Xmas. Because they are such good friends I know that me moving out is going to be a massive blow to them - but then I also know its not my problem (as harsh as it sounds). I'm also concerned with how one of them will react (the one I live with) as I'm almost certain this will mean she will also have to move out (and rent the whole house out to cover costs).   Any advice would be much appreciated!

20090304094713AAcVEQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why can't I look into her eyes?	I like a girl since 2 years now. Well, I actually love her to bits. I haven't yet told her that I like her but me and her are very good friends. Whenever I talk to her I cannot look into her eyes, something just makes me turn my face around. I get nervous. I can only look into her eyes for a maximum of 3 seconds lol, while I do, the first thing I think is that she is really beautiful, I want to kiss her and it feels like she's the only one there with me. I do understand that I get nervous but what actually stops me from looking into her eyes, why does something make me turn my face? Please answer this, thanks alot would be appreciated.

20090304091236AACP5WD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When should you move in/live together?	I’ve been with my boyfriend now for about a year and a few months. We have been on and off twice since we got together. He asked me to move in with him two months after we started dating, I did and we fought allot and made up. I deal with being bipolar and szkizofrenic. My mental disorders disrupt my life on a constant basis. Now he has bought his own house and is living with 3 other guy roommates to help with the mortgage and so he can save a little money. I live with my uncle. Here is my problem. I love my boyfriend and want to spend the rest of my life with him, yes I would like to move back in with him but I’m stuck in a rock and hard place. My uncle has a sexual problem with me and he says things to me that are inappropriate and I have talked to my therapist about it and she said that I need to move out and stay at a shelter, but after that? I’m homeless. I talked to my parents they said no, my friends-that can only last for so long and I work at a job where I don't make enough money to live with another roommate and pay rent and bills ect....I want to move forward with my boyfriend but I don't want to do it because I’m desperate and I don't want to stay with my uncle because he has huge issues and I don't want to stay where I’m not safe. I feel like my boyfriend doesn't want me to move back in with him again because he feels like he made a mistake the first time and he wants me to be better (mentally) before anything like that happens again. The thing is that I am better I have been making allot of progress over the last 2 years with my therapist. What should I do?

We met up at a club and talked all night, I got drunk (very bad - not proud of it) and said that he should marry me LOL...well next day he wrote me on fb and asked for the pic we took the night before with the both of us...we talked everyday all week on fb then met last saturday at a club again...I ended up sleeping with him at his place (probably not a good move). We talked before and after, he asked about who was watching my son...and was talking about having kids (just in general) I'm not sure if he was feeling me out to see if I wanted more kids...he also said that he could handle a woman who had one child but not more because she probably wouldn't want to have more kids and he wants 2 kids and then said 3 (but it was in a way that included my son)...we are getting together this thursday to watch a movie at his place. But it seems like I'm the one inviting him out all the time...is he playing it safe because I have a son or is he just not into me or will I be just a bootycall??

I *foolishly* went out with this boy called Jordan on the same day me and Jack broke up. I thought i did actually like Jordan, but i recently started talking to this boy, whos in all my classes, on msn (David). I have only been dating Jordan for 7 days but i've known him since primary school. He's always been sweet towards be, but he doesn't seem to take much notice when he's with his friends. David on the other hand, is always on msn, takes notice of me, doesn't flirt with others when i'm around. I really don't know what to do, should i keep going out with Jordan, or should i not? I really do quite like David, but i'm not sure if its because i want someone new, as in someone i haven't known before. I'm 13 btw. Please don't say i'm too young, I've only just had my first kiss when i went out with my ex, so i'm not slutty/whatever you want to call me.    Thanks in advance   x

20090227062833AAHVCtU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get out of a relationship and lease when we've just locked ourselves into a new lease?	My boyfriend of three years who I've been living with for 2.5 years and I decided to move into a new, nicer, cheaper place a few months ago and signed a one year lease that will be up at the end of Feb 2010.  A few weeks ago he completely cleaned out my bank account without telling me (he isn't a signer on the account, he forged a check).  He says he was desperate and he is sorry, etc, but I just can't find it in me to trust him anymore.  He's taken every dime I made this winter working a second job and he has contributed nothing to our mutual bills for months now.     My problem is that I need/want to break up with him, but we're locked into a lease until next year.  I'm not really sure how to get out of the lease.  The people we're renting from checked with us many times to make sure we were serious in taking the place before we signed the lease because a family rift was caused by making the other tennant leave.  I guess I'm just a person who likes to do the right thing, but I really need to get out of this relationship and this lease.      Please advise.      Thanks.

20090227062901AABdJfb	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend is such a show off!?	One of my friends has been driving me crazy lately! She is constantly attention seeking..... she either goes on about how her life is far worse than anyone else's, and we've all got it easy; or how her life is amazing and so much better than everyone else's.      She's a pretty nice person when you can actually have a decent conversation with her, but that doesn't happen often as she is far too busy trying to show off and look cool!!!!      She lies about loads of things as well. Like the other day, I said I was hungry, and she was like "Oh no way, you can't be more hungry than me! I had NOTHING for breakfast!" Then later on, someone said they had croissants or something, and she was like "Well I had pancakes, they're much better!" I was like, Um.... you just said.....   I know it sounds stupid lol, but that's just one thing and she does it sooo much more!      She probably doesn't mean it, but it's really hurtful sometimes... I have a disabled brother and it gets really stressful when he's at home, but ohhhhh no..... I should be thankful I don't have her sister apparantly, who seems like a perfectly nice person to me.      I don't feel like she's ever being herself, just always showing off and attention seeking.   I want to be friends with her as she's a nice girl when she's being natural, but how do I tell her to stop all this childish showing off?

20090227063605AACPrll	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHY IS HE KEEPING ME ON THE BACK BURNER?	Okay so ive been seeing and wasting my time on a guy for over 4 years now not a serious relationship ...although there have been times we have actually been together (not long at all and it was few and far between he has told me he loved me in the past) every time we have gotten to that point he acts weird says I cant believe im in a relationship when it was his idea then he acts like a jerk and poof its over. He is 31 and hasn’t had a serious relationship since high school. He doesn’t express his emotions hardly ever and its nearly impossible to communicate with him he just pretends like I said nothing mostly, so I cant ask him anything about how he feels or why he treats me the way he does at best he just says idk. He rarely will talk to anyone on the phone he communicates thru text and its bad because he travels for work 6 months out of the year .Now the past year the pattern is text me every day allot for a few months while he is gone for work (I do go and see him usually while he is gone) then when he comes home everything is different he doesn’t talk to me that much ignores my texts of course he still contacts me and shows a interest when he wants me to come over. However I just recently thru snooping discovered that he had been texting this girl from Alabama while he was home (we live in ny and it seems any time he talks to another girl she lives far away in a place he has never been I think he meets them online he was talking to a girl from work before however) .So im guessing that’s why I was being some what ignored. (I say somewhat because of course he will reach out when it’s convenient for him if you know what I mean) All those times ignored for girls that don’t even live where we do. Of course now that he is leaving he is being super nice and wanting to talk to me everyday, Every time I get too far he is pulling me back in again (maybe its because he stopped talking to that girl idk) I almost always spend the last night with him before he leaves if he had anyone important wouldn’t that be them .I asked him why he suddenly had a strong interest for me now that he was leaving and could have cared less while he was home he said idk why I do that I guess its easy that way…. well I finally got a brain and told him to take a flying leap but why was he always trying to keep me around ?because he could and he knows ill always be there because my dumb *** puts up with the poor treatment?  Is he just looking for something better? I’m there just in case? It just hurts because after four years you would hope some body would care a little for you in any way. He is a prick and can be extremely selfish with everyone I must say. He totally disregards my feelings and doesn’t listen to a word I say when I tell him how I feel. When I tell him I am done he texts me a week later like I said nothing.Im disapointed in myself because i allowed myself to be treated this way he takes me for granted and thinks i will always be there because im dumb and have. But what gives I am done with him for good but some clarity would be great what kind of guy uses people for his conveinience and takes advantage of girls in that way with no emotion involved when he knows he is hurting them. im not the only girl he has treated poorly i know that!!!!!

I love this one girl I used to be friends with, but she hates me...It's a little complicated to go into.  Even though we haven't even seen each other in years I still love her.  Now I have this other friend that I think I'm starting to have feelings for...  Problem is she has a boyfriend.....I..just..can someone please tell me what to do?
20090227063854AAieKoH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help?! Does he like me or not? guys or girls?	Ok, now this is may be kinda long sorry. Well there's this guy I;ve been friends with for about a year and a bit on msn, we've exchanged ph. no.s all that jazz etc. but he's my friends older brother and is 4 yr older than me (17 and him 21). I'm not too worried about the age difference because he is a genuinely nice person and hilarious! However I've had a crush on him for a while and he didn't know, but we kinda can talk about anything really with ease and he has complimented me on occasions saying I was pretty and jokes about my "smartness" lol I don't really agree with these compliments lol yeah I try to do as well as i can at school because I want a good job. He's a great friend, but the problem is my older sister decided to tell him about how i felt:S which i hoped she wouldnt because I wanted to just kid of get over what I was feeling even though it would be hard and take forever, but I don't want to screw up my friendship with my friend and with him. So we were talking on msn about random stuff and I was talking about dying my hair red to do something different lol, and he kinda teases me about my "emo"  music choices and usually bags out on the style, but i asked whether it would look too emo, and he said something like i think they look hot. but then this is when i found out a bit later that my sister had told him coz he asked me about it, and me being completely embarassed like crazy said yeah and avoided awkward silence as much as possible talking about stuff. but yeah then he kinda said he liked me a bit that way too but I don;t know whether this meant from a while ago and is over it now, or he feels like that:S but then the next couple of days i haven't heard anything really from him :S So I don't know what's going on :S   Please help?! Guys or girls what does this mean?

20090227064252AA7QtYU	Family & Relationships;Family	WHY DOES MY MOM HATE ME?	So I've always been the black sheep of the family so to speak because i am darker and heaver when my siblings and i were children i ...,and although i was a good kid i always was the last to get praise {for any good doings}and the first to get beat for anything even if i didn't do it. so it's apparent that my mother has always played favorites and didn't mind making me feel like i didn't belong she would take my sister out shopping and make me stay home saying    "the stores were going to don't sell you size " allowing and sometimes encouraging my sisters to make fun of me me ,so id stay in my room and eat i never went outside i just ate and went to school i guess i was depressed and just plain tired of the reticule from my family    and one day i just got feed up my sister who's 2 years older than me hit me and i finally hit her back and know that I'm older i stand up for myself and I'll be honest I've even pushed my mom {{{{there is no excuse  to put your hands on your mom but she was choking the hell out of me}}} I'm just so angry from all the years of abuse i don't know how to handle it I've beaten so bad my whole face was swollen and as dark as i am I've had soooooo many bruises and burns from curling irons our daddy died when we were babies so i never had any body else but her to day while i was in the kitchen making breakfast i was in my moms way and instead of her saying move like she usually does she just flew of the edge she started throwing pot's tell me I'm always in the way she even said she hates me and wish i was dead and the only thing i had said to her today was ...good morning mama...    what would make a mom act this way with her own child and although she's mistreated me my whole life i don't hate her nor wish she was dead i just want her to love and except me I've recently lost 100 lbs in a year i now weight 150 she's never even acknowledged it yet she notices when my sister's get hair cuts or new clothes we were in the mall last week my mom sisters and i and this lady was telling me how pretty i was and she never acknowledged my sister's it pissed my mom off and she acted like she was mad at me the rest of the day i just can't WIN what should i do? and why does she act this way with me?
20090304082645AABDcmT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I worry about this guy's weekend?	I'm a 35 year old married woman, husband is the same age.      We've been together 4 years, married almost one year. Each year my hubby goes on a guy's trip with a group of buddies he' known since childhood, and sometimes a couple others that have become friends with someone in the group through work or whatever. For the most part, these trips really are all about bonding and hanging out, since these guys barely see each other anymore. But I am worried about well, other women. All but 2 of the 7 guys are married, so I doubt these are skirt-chasing trips, but is it wishful thinking if I believe it's all about the guys only?      This year, they are renting a house in Tahoe in July for the trip. I'm worried about them bringing girls back to the house to party and hot tub. My hubby once went on a guy's trip with a different group of guys he barely knew, and he got really drunk and went a little too far with a stripper at a club, and lied about it. This was not with this group, most of whom I know and trust, and it was years ago, but it devasted me when I found out and I've never fully trusted him drunk since. He gets so out of it and I worry what he'll do. I'm worried about them hiring strippers to come to the rented house and just about if they will include ladies in their activities.      Are guy's weekends about the guys or does this have to mean girls too? Should I worry?
20090304083027AAYgRcS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Need a good revenge prank.   Non damaging, hard to clean  up though, can't be re-usable.   Help?	Some friends dumped rice all over my car.  Jerks, had to vacuum it out of the engine and stuff.  So I need to get my revenge, need ideas for something that wouldn't be monetarily damaging, that would be difficult and/or time consuming to take care of, and would not be able to be re-used against me (IE - rice again, they can just scoop it up and dump it back on my car).      Any thoughts?
20090304083200AAWO41S	Family & Relationships;Friends	My Roommate Is Getting on My Nerves?	I swear I only go to my dorm between 12pm through 7am to sleep and it seems I can't even do that.      My roommate is one of those people who needs the tv on in order to go sleep.  The room is so small even if he turns the volume down it still keeps me up.      On top of that he is black, so everything has to be at max volume or else he can't hear it.      One time I asked him to turn the tv off at 2am he said no because he was multi-tasking with the tv and his laptop.      What do I do?  How can I make him see that it really does affect me and my learning?

Thanks everyone for such prompt replies.Just needed one more help, this girl loves a person who is my biggest rival.She knows this fact already, upon asking her to keep her relationship secret at least in front of me her reply was its her life and I am no one to interfere. If she finds me sitting lonely and if she is talking to someone else she never comes to me and says I talk with you alot and I get to talk to that person only then so please don't stalk me. Suddenly I became a stalker and she thinks I clog her life. I always make a decision not to talk to her but I am not been able to forget her.
20090304085031AA1CMqJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Do you think I have a right to be angry?	I have been best best friends with my friend Andy for 3 years. We have always been really really close. We have the same group of friends.       Then, 2 months ago he told me completely out of the blue (apparenly everyone else knew) that he was in love with me. I told him that I cared for him a lot but I thought of him as a brother.       He said he needed some 'time to think' to one of our friends and completely blanked me. Its now been 2 months and he still hasn't spoken to me. He has told everyone that he still cares a lot for me but he can't be my friend at the moment. He said it was my fault for leading him on. He says he'll start speaking to me again at the end of summer but we're going to University then anyway and I'm going to Manchester and he's going to Southampton (opposite sides of England) so that seems pointless.      I was very upset and cried about it for weeks but now all I feel is angry.    Do I have a right to feel like this or not because maybe I did lead him on and didn't realise...      Thanks x
20090304085123AA2TErc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to contact the ex-wife of someone I know that I haven't seen in two years.  What should I say?	They attended my church and I knew her socially.  I was always attracted to her and they divorced two years ago and she moved to a nearby city.  I have her mailing address and was thinking about dropping her a card just to say hey.  Not like a Hallmark card.  Just a little note card.  Maybe give her my email address and phone number and ask her to shoot me a note to say how she's doing.  Ladies?  What would impress you?
20090304085451AANb0xh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question: In or out? what do you do?	Okay..so I'll admit i never really thought of this before, because me and my man use condoms. But I'm going on Birth control soon, so things will obviously be a little different. I always just figured he'd *** inside me like he usually does. But some of my friends have said that their husbands usually pull out, because they don't like the mess inside, and they say it drips for too long and doesn't smell good. So, they say they pull out even on birth control. How about you guys? Does it really bother you? What do you do?

He's been acting really weird lately and I guess I kinda knew. I logged onto his myspace, on accident, and found out that he emailed her about a song called "kiss me over the phone" and told her he had feelings for her etc.    I'm so angry I don't know what to do. I don't know if I can move on from this even though I know that I love him. We have 2.75 kids together and have been together 5 years. Any advice?

My concern is he in the past has had a history of cheating with a local old GF. Hes been "clean" for 4 yrs BUT 2 yrs ago I cought he chating with her on his my space account. As soon as he knew I saw her messsages he deleted his account. Now he has this twitter account that he "updates" constantly with what he is doing .The funny thing is when he updates he has never said anything about me or doing something with me. Is this weird? Is there a way this old GB and him could be contacting each other back and fouth and I would not be able to tell?

She got mad at me because of an email that I sent to a girl she does not like while we were apart. I never cheated on her, I lied to her sometimes. I did things that were wrong. She once told me she hated me and to get out of her life. So I broke up with her. I did not go out with any girl, I did not flirt or had feelings for any other girl.I need this girl in my life, she tells me that she does not know what to do, that she needs time and that to leave her alone. But yet she txts this other guy and talks to him, while I just wait. I mean if she wants to move on its ok, but not a month later after we broke up. We dated to 2 and a half years, she could of at least waited. I really love this girl with all my heart. I cant be with out her. What should I do?
20090304094056AAXABvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it really THAT easy for him to get over me?	My boyfriend and I dated for nearly 4 months. For the last month things started going downhill and before I knew it, he dumped me. We talked and talked and he said that he was really confused and that he does still like me a lot, but just didn't feel a strong connection anymore. At first he didn't want to break up at all, but I told him he had to make a decision, so after thinking about it, he wanted to end it. Then the next day on his Facebook he started talking to this random girl about hanging out some time soon and being REALLY flirty. There were also pictures of him laughing and having fun with his friends, wearing the same shirt I gave him for Christmas. I would never be able to wear the necklace he gave me like it was just any old necklace I own... I had to get rid of it.      It really feels like he wasn't affected by the break up at all. I know looks aren't everything, but it really broke my heart to see him act like that. I'm still crying about the break up and he's out there laughing and goofing around... So what do you think?

20090304111303AA50Rpb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex won't let my new bf look after my kids?	My ex husband has heard rumours that I am seeing someone these days. He moved out 6mths ago. He said on the phone the other day that he doesn't want this guy or any other bloke for that matter to ever look after our kids or be left alone with our kids because he has it in his head that I am a vunerable mum of 3 kids. The thing is I have been dating this guy for 8mths and it is really serious. He is even talking about taking on the kids and me in the future. How will that work and where do I stand? Surely he can't dictate to me who brings up our kids? My bf is a better role model than my ex could ever be!

20090304101923AAGC94V	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my dad do this?	My dad is a alcoholic. He is retired and drinks every day. He gets up at 6am and by 930 am he is drinking all ready. My mom is at work,and I am here with him all day. He stays in the basement and watches tv,BUT can hear him cracking the beer cans open. He never gets violent.Most people cant even tell he has been drinking. When he drinks he just gets spaced out in his own world. My mom hates this so he hides it. It is a joke. He will hide the beer in the kitchen window,and get up every 5 minutes to go take a drink. He walks around the house with the beer in his mouth and his cheek all puffed out for a few minutes before he will swallow it. And he is like 65,but acts like he is 100. Walks real slow,and just does some very strange things. Everyone in my family knows he drinks so to hide it is just crazy. Does he really think we dint know he is drinking? does he think we are stupid and that when he hides it we dint know. Like we dont see the dam beer can in the window,or the bathroom closet.

My friend just moved to the city I live in, and we see each other just about everyday since we work close by. Anyway, she is still meeting friends, and has been lucky, but still seems to depend on me to meet more people. I have been seeing a guy and he does a lot of cool stuff like has parties and goes out a lot.      Anyway, whatever he does, he usually invites me along too. If I tell my friend my plans, she immediately says: "I wanna go!!" like a little kid. It is really starting to annoy me, especially since if I don't say what my plans are, she will assume that I'm free and that the two of us can do something.

20090304101535AAoUO4G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do women this crazy exist?	My fiance met a girl in a bar while he was out of town for the summer for work (we were not dating at the time). They had a little fling which I'm assuming more than he's led on, although his coworkers/friends insist it was nothing even physical, but it's in the past and we weren't even together. Anyway, once he got back home we got back together and recently got engaged (this was 6 months ago).       This girl texts and calls him constantly. She stopped for a couple months, then recently started up again full force. He ignores all of her calls and texts. She checks his facebook multiple times a day and will then text him asking about who this girl is, why he went on a trip with me, if he's really engaged, etc. She also texts and leaves voicemails begging him to call her. He's been ignoring her, but the other night he got so sick of it he deleted her from facebook, called her and told her to stop calling, he's engaged, and she is being inappropriate. She started berating me (I have never even met this girl), then started telling him he's the only person she cares about and she doesnt' want to stop talking, etc. Even after all this, she is still texting and keeps trying to add him on facebook.       She lives 1000 miles away. She will NOT go away even 6 months later. They only hung out for 6 wks. Do girls this crazy exist? Is there anything else we can do?

20090304102233AAThdlQ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Maggie Sottero prices?	I am in love with sooo many of her designs. I have not found a dress I love just as much as the ones I love from her. The website will not tell you how much dresses cost, and you have to call a retailer to ask, but Im still browsing and am not going to call every 5 minutes with "how much does this one cost". So whats the price range of maggie sottero dresses, are they ridiculous? My boyfriend doesn't want me to spend more than 1200, so am I wasting my time?
20090304114015AA7HjA7	Family & Relationships;Weddings	My Maid of Honor is nothing but stress?!?	This past Saturday, one of my bridesmaids threw me an amazing bridal shower.  She planned the entire thing and even paid for it herself (as our wedding gift), although she was still expecting some money from the MOH.  On the day of the shower, my MOH showed up, left as soon as the last present was opened (instead of staying to help clean up) and didn't give my bridesmaid any money, like she promised!  Now she said she will give it to her next time.  Why not just send a check?        Now my bridesmaid is telling me to ask the MOH for money.  I feel really uncomfortable with this scenario, especially since she's always very defensive and thinks everything is a personal attack on her.  This girl has been nothing but trouble from day one, and I don't want to find out that she stiffed my bridesmaid and made me look like an idiot!      What to do?  I am thisclose to having my fiance put a check in the mail for contribution to the bridal shower.

20090304113703AA8FhbM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can he do about his ex not letting him speak to his child?	My friend has a son that he does not see.  He and his wife are separated and he sent her divorce papers (she is not signing them).  He pays child support every month (even though there is no order for it and his name is not on the birth certificate, but DNA says the child is his) on time and has been calling his child every day, but she is not answering his phone calls.  She changed her email and identifying info on Myspace so he cannot find her on there.   He desperately wants to speak to his child, but she(the ex) is ignoring him. And they live 5,000 miles apart.  Is there some kind of law or something that he can use to get to speak to his child?  He could care less about his ex, but wants to talk to his baby.

20090304100610AA6jCfN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you deal with your partner being attracted to other people?	I asked my boyfriend if he imagines himself having sex with other hot women and he admitted that he does. He said it's just a fleeting image in his head and then he brushes it aside. I don't know why, but it really bugs me, partly because I don't have the same graphic fantasies about other people. Going out in public is kind of uncomfortable now because I suspect he's fantasizing about the hot women we see. He's 23 and I'm 26. What should I do?
20090304095628AAEM73i	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Still feeling uneasy about the other night..?	Last week my guy had a few friends over for drinks. There was one girl there whom hes been friends with since kindergarden and hes told me about her a few times prior to this night. I understand my guy has alot of friends some are girls and I have no problem with that. However, on this particular night he payed an awful lot of attention to this one. At one point, I knew everyone had a little too much to drink and my boyfriend was pretty wasted, but I happened to notice his hand on her leg for a moment. Than as I was leaving the bathroom my guy had his arms around her trying to unhook her bra. Obviously I was very upset with this and when my boyfriend asked me what was wrong I didnt say anything, he didnt even know what he did! His other guy friend was mad also, this girl was someone he dated before and still had feelings for. I asked him if I should be upset and he said "yes..he does this with every girl." This ontop of the drinks made me feel physically sick, I ended up going to bed angry and sick with my boyfriend and I told him I wasnt sure if I could trust him. He was also upset that I believe his friend over him, but we made up and have been fine since. I told him I trust him, which I do, but for some reason I still feel weird about that situation, I didnt know how to act? What would you have done and how would you feel? Please dont say break-up, we have a great relationship and this was the first slip-up and so I excused it, but I just want to know how others would of reacted. Offer postive advice please and thanks!

Im 34 and my bf doesn't want kids now, he says maybe later (like 5 yrs) but i can't count on that, what if he changes his mind or we break up then i'll have waited for nothing or risk the health of my child.      I don't want to break up at all bc he is my soulmate, my best friend, my greatest lover and my warrior. I was thinking of getting artificially inseminated - but i don't know how he'll react when i tell him. He wouldn't have to do anything with the child if he didn't want to. I am financially sound on my own and my parents have promised to take care of it while i'm at work and babysit whenever i need.

Ok so there is this guy in my neighborhood and i barely ever had any social interaction with him, just seen him sometimes. So once when i was walking by he called out aloud "WITCH" . The next when i saw him walking by my house he looked at me and was like 'sorry' and i was damn angry so i said 'eff off' and showed him the middle finger and he kept looking at me and walking by. At night again i saw him again ( even though he lives a lil away )passing by with his friends,and and they were looking at me and he was like 'don't look don't look' and then i again showed him the middle finger and called out abuses but he didn't abuse back or something.    Then the next day i saw him out again and his friends were like pushing him towards my direction and he was moving back and then pushing him again and he was moving back, They were doing this laughingly.      And it ain't that i look like a witch or something, many of his friends have the hots for me but i don't know why this guy is messing with me? any ideas why he would call me a WITCH???

20090304104255AA2PNJ2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is that just how men are?	We been married for about 5yrs and my husband has never asked about my side of family (like birthdays, age, brother/sisters names, etc) or even seem interested in knowing.  I would talk about my family/friends and he would just watch tv or say "oh ah ha" and look away without asking further questions or even seem interested.   He doesn't even know my stepdad of 30+ years last name(just an example) or even the names of my teenage niece/nephew.      Me on the other hand, I ask too many questions and to top that, I know & send out birthdays cards to his side of the family and even remember to send cards/money to his niece/nephews on holidays.  He doesn't even know my niece/nephew exist. (just kidding)   When he talks about his family/friends, I would ask questions cuz i'm interested in his thoughts of them and how the story goes or ended, etc.      I have to agree our communication needs work.  But isn't it somewhat weird that my husband doesn't ask about my side of the family?     Or is that just how men are?

20090304101648AAYGT73	Family & Relationships;Family	I want to scream at her! Am I overreacting?	My sister and I have never really been close. Our family has been through a lot and, while it made me close to my other family, it drove me and my sister further apart. Anyway, she's lived in Louisiana for 5 years with her husband and 3 children (6, 5 & 5). She's over here for a couple of weeks and I saw her this weekend. I'm pregnant for the 4th and I'm so happy about it. My sister on the other hand decided to act like a complete idiot. She told me that I was so annoyed about the possibility of her becoming pregnant before me that I deliberately got pregnant first. The first time I got pregnant was through rape and my baby died. I wanted to scream at her for saying such a horrible thing. Also, I'm not with my son's dad because he ran out on me, our baby and our engagement. She knows this and yet she had a massive go at me saying I shouldn't keep him out of my son's life (which I'm not doing - he's been able to see our son whenever he wants but he doesn't want to). I'm also getting married to the guy I've been with for 5 years and she's telling me things like I'm rushing into things to outshine her. Her husband and her children are saying congratulations to us for the wedding and the baby and how they hope everything goes alright (we have 3 y/o triplets but 2 of them died so we're praying this little one is healthy). She's just really upsetting me and I just want to know if people not related to any of us think I'm overreacting. If you want to know anything else, just ask.

20090304100616AACYJRO	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I cant stand my family! : (?	sorry this is so long : ( heres the story my bf and I have been going out since Dec 30 2007 : ) we are both sophomores in college and we both go to school in Ohio. He lives there so i see him everyday while I'm at school. But for the summers I go home to NJ which I hate :( My dad doesnt like him because he is black and im white but he is a gentlemen and is not a thug. Bottom line is that we dont care because we are getting married anyway after college:) For spring break this year we are going to my familes townhouse in Mrytle Beach, South Carolina. But the problem is my parents dont want my bf going. He is stilll going though. I told them he is not going and im going with 2 girls but its just gunna be me and him. We did the same thing last year for break. Last year my parents sent me in the mail the directions and the house key, but this year they are just sending the directions and having my mom's friend that lives down there come and give me the house key when I arrive to the house. I asked my mom why dont they just mail it with the directions like last year and shes like "you dont mail a house key" and im like " mom you guys did last year" and shes like NO. They problem is that Im afraid that my parents are gunna have there friends down there spy on me and then tell them that its just me and my bf. Its just annoying becauase we are looking forward to it for soooo long and im gunna be scared the whole time. : ( When I get there Im having my bf just go into a grocery store and tell the guy thats giving me to key that my friends all had to get things in the store. But like I dont want the guy and his wife like comin to me house, all me and my bf wanna do is enjoy ourselves. Don't you think its like my parents dont trust me : (        I just wish my parents would except him but if they dont then its there loss because we are in love. : )

Well me and this guy had a massive ugly fight before christmas and after new years. We were not in a committed relationship but saw each other a lot. the things he said to me made me feel like he never cared for me and that I was nothing to him, i insulted him and made fun of him. i was so hurt and angry , I never wanted to see him ever again.

20090304095447AAmyMnm	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Oh dear god, what have i done!? Please don't judge.?	Okay, what i'm about to tell you makes me a **** and i know it so don't go on telling me that i'm a ****, and i'm not proud of it. My sisters boyfriend is 21, my sister is also 21. I'm 17, 18 in july. Anyway ive always known really that her boyfriend liked me, but i tried to forget about it and just tell myself hes a jerk and you can't tell your sister because she's so happy with him. Anyway once when she came into my room holding hands with him, she asked if i wanted some pancakes because they were making them, i said yes please. They went to make them, but then i suppose my sister asked him to ask me what i wanted on them. I was sitting at the computer when he run his hand down my back slowly, i sort of jumped and said what the hell. I gave him a horrible look, i wasn't that surprised really. I then turned back to the computer and huffed. Then he put his head on my shoulder and asked what i wanted on the pancakes and i moved quickly and walked out the room and said syrup as i walked out. I have tried telling my mum but every time i tried telling her she just says stuff trying to ruin this for your sister, i know you don't like him but try and get used to it. So i gave up. He then stopped after a while as i snapped at him but the other day i was really upset about something that happened with my friend, and he was at mine waiting for my sister and he hugged me, i did'nt want him too and he kissed me, it wasnt a full blown kiss or anything it was more just a tender kiss. And i didnt stop him!. I want to tell my sister but i know it will crush her and she might not beleive me and hate me. What do i do, and because i didnt get him off of me, she might hate me. I never usually would let him its just i was so upset. Advice please? Thanks.
20090304100142AAmg9Mk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my life so hard just because of one thing?	Living in england....      I was born in israel and moved to england wen i was 4. I was always insecure about being the only jew in school. It was fine in primary school, but when i got to secondary school.. it all turned around. We had a lesson on how jewish babies are circumcised.. and ever since then i haven't even approached a gal..  I swear i had all da girls before... and now all i do is wait till i'm 18 so i can go back to israel. This is so tough. What makes it even worse is that i started puberty at 11.... imagine thinking about girls for 4-5 years without asking them out! I'm too insecure... in israel, if ur not circumcised, you would be made fun of. This makes me so pissed off, all it would take was for my parents to keep me where i belong!

When I first met his kid I instantly was drawn to him. (he's the cutest thing ever) It was just really weird one day because my boyfriend had duty (he's in the military) so I took his kid all day to hang out. We were at Burger King ordering food and he said "I want the whopper jr mommy!" it was flattering but really shocking. I'm really young so I don't know what to make of it.

He gets out of control and strts pulling his own hair.His face gets so red and sometimes[a lot of the time] he hits me or throws things at me. Its like he is screaming for help...I don't know wht to do. We've been to the pediatrician. He rcmmended a psycologist,there is a year long waiting list.  meanwhile what do I do? Keepin mind these are NOT just temper tantrms.They are far worse. I thought maybe he was autistic[mildly] the doctor thinks it's ADHD,because my 11yo has it. I feel like he just doesn't understand. I know in my gut that something else is going on.I am a single mother of 2 boys[5 and 11].Can anyone give me an idea of what to do next?It's getting out of control and I am scared. He's good at school[I asked the teacher if she had same problems].School i only 3 hours a day.

Ok, I'm going to ask this again with more detail cos I don't think my situation was quite understood ;)   I know this really shy guy, who is so shy that he rarely ever speaks to girls...or speaks at all, in fact. I got his number through school project we were doing together.   I decided to text him "Hi, lol...what's up?" and without waiting, stupidly sent "You should speak more...i'm sure your convos are very interesting." then sent another one. A couple of hours later i realised how stupid i had been and texted him an apology....this was all two days ago and he still hasn't replied. I don't usually talk to him in class and don't feel that it would be natural to just bring it up as he has a couple of friends in class. We only have one class together and that's English, though he's not the brightest bulb in the class so felt it would be pointless to ask him about anything.   He's usually surrounded by guy friends and I'm not that big on approaching ppl, I'm extremely shy but quite loud at the same time (?)   What should i say????

My parents sent me away to boarding school at a young age so I feel like I never really got to know them, and none of us get along. I see my family a few times a year, usually for a month for christmas, and a few months for summer.       This past year, I spent the summer here in Texas (only saw my family for about 2 weeks in the summer) and this christmas I wasn't able to come back home. Whenver I come back home, We're all really nice for about 2 weeks, until we start fighting again.       My mother has decided to ruin my spring break by coming to visit to renew her greencard so I can (in her own words) "be her chauffeur". This woman is the type who calls me everyday to ask silly questions like "whatever happened to that green skirt I bought you two years ago?" and if I don't answer she calls about 10 times in a row until I pick up the phone, and it's never an emergency, but she just wants to talk about that green skirt.       I have to drive her all around the united states so she can visit her friends for my spring break, which is really a time I needed to use to catch up with all my school work, especially papers that I'm assigned from classes to finish up over break. She will be prying into my life, especially about my new boyfriend (she asks questions over the phone like she's an interviewer or something). How can I make this week more bearable?       I love my mother, she loves me, But we can't stand each other.

My one and a half year old sister, Briella, always had a special bond with me, because we are the only sisters in my family with 6 brothers. But recently she is extremely jealous of my boyfriend Mitchel. I think it's because my boyfriend and I just started spending a lot more time together last month. It used to be no big deal, but the closer he and I get, the more out-of-control she gets. If Briella comes into my room and sees me sitting on Mitchel's lap or something, she will run over and try to squeeze herself between us and get on my lap, and she won't get off until he leaves. Yesterday Mitchel, Briella and I were walking down the beach in the morning, and Briella was still tired so I was carrying her, after about an hour, I got tired so I put her down, and she was fine walking, but as soon as I held Mitchels hand, she sat down on the beach and started screaming until I picked her back up. LISTEN TO THIS: A few times, when it's just me, Briella, and Mitchel at home, she will actually go sit in her room, try to take her diaper off, and try to pee on the floor so I will give her a bath and not pay attention to Mitchel. Yesterday, she ACTUALLY POOPED ON THE FLOOR when I was playing Wii with Mitchel. Mitchel is very sweet to her and it seems like she should like him. I hate to see her so upset like this, but I'm not leaving Mitchel because of it, so how can I make her stop this terrible jealous behavior before it gets out of hand??

20090304095756AAYgBYZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I move back in with my parents?	So I've been out of the house for about 5 years now and can fully support myself. However, I dropped out of college earlier in life and am now going back. My parents asked if I want to move back in with them so that I wouldn't have to pay any rent, which would pretty much take care of all the college bills and would save me thousands of dollars every year. It sounds like a juicy offer, but I've always thought of people that move back in with their parents as the worlds biggest losers (especially men), and I'm worried that I may fall into a depressive state if I put myself in the same category.      So they are essentially handing me a free scholarship at the cost of my pride. Should I consider doing this?
20090304101702AALiA63	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Teen Mom dating again...?	Okay. When I was 13 years old I acted stupid [you don't got to tell me] & I was into drugs and sex and all this stupid stuff. I lost my virginity to this guy & we continued having sex. Eventually, my Dad caught us on [on camera in the back of his store- I didn't know they had a camera]. So basically he HATES this guy. Well, it has been 3 years, and we have started talking again. Last night he asked me out to Applebees, he even said he would pay and he wouldn't mind if my Mom and son came. This is a totally different person than the other guy I knew- the other one would be thinking of ways for us to get alone. I really want to try this again, but take it slow. We both have kids [mine is almost 2 months, his is 2 weeks], and we have realized our mistakes. He has changed big time. We both are home schooled. Myself, so I can stay home and take care of my son. & him, because he has a full time job to support his. Sex isn't an option here, neither of us want another child. The question is how to get my Dad to let me go out with him? What do I say? What would help? & please, don't bash me for having a child by the time I was 15. I am doing a great job. I am planning on graduating and becoming a dental hygienist. My son isn't a mistake, just a large bump in the road- and this is not going to stop me from accomplishing my dreams- nothing will. It'll just make them more challenging & I can be twice as proud of myself in the long run. I've learned my lesson, & sex before marriage isn't going to happen. Say I am wrong all you want, but I am not even going to put myself in a situation where that will be possible. I am keeping it in public places and under supervision. :) Thanks,      This is the 3rd freaking time I had to re post this. I guess no one thought my title was interesting enough to click on at first! Lol.

20090304104714AAYnjOo	Family & Relationships;Family	Bad secerts...kids keep? why?	I asked this queston lastt night but somehow it was deleted and i wasent able to see any answers. So ill try it again..okay well why do kids not tell a trusted adult things that they need to tell? ill use a example: (its only a example nothing more) lets say im a girl who is going through sexual abuse everyy night and that Im too afraid to tell but when I have a clear chance to say something I go completely numb and nothing ever comes out my mouth and it continues to happen. why is it that its so easy to not say a word and to just deal with it rather than telling and have it stop? what if the person u tell dont believe you and it begins to get even worse or what if u just dont want to tell because your worried about how people will look at you completely different and your ashamed about it. so why..why dont kids tell?

20090304101034AAoHjA8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Complicated situation (help)?	Basically i like this girl and she likes me but im not sure how much she likes me. I asked her do we have a future and she said I'm not sure yet and she said if you cant wait then don't. I go to hers to watch movies with her and we cuddle but we never kiss and said before that she isn't sure if we should kiss yet. i slept with a girl a month before all this and she asks about her often. Thing is i like the girl a lot but I don't know how long I should leave it. She is foreign though and has been treated bad in the past. But i've known her for about 5months and the last month has been the step up to cuddling and going to hers.    I said to her does she like me a couple of months ago and it ended up me saying to her i don't want to know you because I don't see you as a friend and she got upset about it. So i decided to talk to her and then she kissed me when she was drunk.   after a night out she asked me did i kiss anyone       i go to uni and i cud fail so i don't want to keep liking her if she doesnt like me coz i won't see her again if i don't get through the year.      What do i do about the situation
20090304113545AASRX0A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Worst thing she's ever done to me. How long should I wait before confronting my gf?	My gf and I were just getting over a fight. I took her out for sushi and then to a bar for drinks. She was extremely distant, moody, cold, mean and insulting the entire night. When we got back to her house she told me she had to work the next morning and that she'd get better sleep if I didn't stay over (the first time this has ever happened in 3 months. i always stay over). I was drunk, but she didn't seem worried about me getting a dui or in an accident. she then called me on my way out and asked me to come back and hang out a little longer. i was pissed, but i went back thinking she may have realized what she did. after no more than 10 minutes she said she was going to bed and kicked me out again. I've never been so angry with anyone's selfishness, let alone someone who's supposed to care about me. i haven't spoken with her since saturday. she texted me yesterday but i gave her single-word replies until she got the hint and left me alone. should i wait until she calls me to confront her or should i keep blowing her off until she calls me?

20090304103706AA8axT9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell my wife I'm a bigamist- with a blackman?	I've been with my wife for three years now after moving here from South Africa. I do love her dearly but I do have a secret that I don't know whether to tell my wife.    I met my future wife online and flew over, little did she know I was already married (though unhappily) to a Nigerian man. I was young when I met Clive, promiscuos and foolish.    I still talk to him in secret and have told him I was imported to England. I send him photos and videos to keep him young, happy and excited. Is it risky not telling Betty? Should I cut off Clive, I am also worried he is now a pimp which I think is highly unethical. He was previously a giggalo in Pretoria which I believe is less risky.    Could I destroy my marriage?

Ive been seeing this guy, its nothing official but it basically is...  We havent done anything besides make-out and until we are official i wont do anything else and he is perfectly fine with that. But when ever im at his house, im there really late anyways. 2 am-ish and by then we are both knotting back and forth to sleep. So when 2 comes around, i have to drive home 20 min half asleep with crazies on the road. I would much rather just stay ssleeping at his house.       i have a list of reason why i would let me. And honestly the only reason i want to is so that i dont have to drive home at 2 am, look out for animals and drunk drivers and soo i can spend more time with him.... its not for sex.

20090304095451AA7Yj9Z	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When do end a marriage, when one partner admits that stop love the other?	I'm married for 6 years and we have 2 children. About a year ago my spouse told me that she doesn't love me the same way she loved me when we  first met, and she wants to separate. After several talks we agreed to retry to fire up our marriage and the relationship. Lately she admitted to physically attracted to black men. One night she went out and i believe she messed around with a guy, however I can't verify that. After our last argument she said that we can stay married cohabit for the sake of the children, however we can see other people as well. I have partially agreed for the sake of the children even though is not morally correct. In the main time with my help she posted an ad for an NSA encounter, and I'm silently helping her navigate through the "process". I know what i'm doing is crazy and wrong however the idea arouses me. Deep inside me i'm thinking that she's going trough a stage or even she's is doing all this for just the experience. I'm so confused, any ideas how to proceed from here?      Ps. I have offer the idea of marriage  counseling  however she doesn't want to go.

20090304100805AA9tY7o	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Kid's counselor advised me to stop visitation to NCP. he has also moved- refuses to give new address. advice?	despite serious concerns I had about visitation, he was awarded limited unsupervised visitation. I complied, but he would often not have food, neglected a medical problem that landed her in an ER, kept her truant from school, and isolated in a tiny bedroom with him the entire visit (rents a room in a small house with unknown roommates). dozens of other issues as well. child's counselor advised me to stop visits and file an ex parte- I did. denied until hearing. for her safety and welfare I refused to allow visits. hearing is in less than two weeks and he has now moved without a forwarding address or phone (disconnected). left messages on my home phone he wouldn't see her for months but replied to court he wanted no change to visits.  what now?   don't qualify for legal aid, can't afford an attorney- I spend all my $ on my daughter, there is no support order (he has next to no income). ideas? he is statinghe wants me jailed for contempt.

20090304101312AAW56uQ	Family & Relationships;Family	I need help with my sister... please help!?	I have a twin sister, we are 22 years old. My sister has never had a boyfriend, and dosent know how to talk to guys let alone go out with one. She dosent take any advice from me because I met my Husband when we were 16 and he was 17. my opinion means nothing because I have only been with one person for 6 years. Even though I told her that I know my guy is an exception for there being an awesome guy, I tell her that she never knows she might meet a good guy anywhere but she'll never know unless she at least try's to talk to guys... This was actually an argument we had last night over the phone. She is so depressed about still living with my parents, having a job she dosent like, not having a boyfriend she thinks she's too fat and ugly. I tell her all the time she's not, I mean I'm like 30lbs heavier then she is and I get asked out all the time. she used to be anorexic for about 2 years it was bad, then she became an alcoholic, and now she cuts/burns herself. last night she was really drunk saying how she hates her self and she'll never get a boyfriend then she hung up on me. I kept trying to call her and call her but she wouldn't answer, I was worried that she would do something stupid, so I called the house phone and my mom answered, I told her everything... the cutting, drinking, etc. my mom handled it pretty well and then my sister called me back from her cell telling me that I better not be on the phone with mom. I then called her and told her what i told mom, she flipped out. she said she could never tell me anything anymore, that she would have to pick and choose the thing she tells me because I cant keep a secret. I told her your definition of a secret is different then mine, If its normal thing i can keep it but if its something that my parents need to be aware of then I'm gonna tell them.... She thinks how I used to think when I was 16, immature... she blames me for moving on with my life, and she's stuck literally waiting for some guy to sweep her off her feet, she will not make an effort to talk to them because that's not what happens in her romance novels. So now she has given up all hope on finding someone, even though she has never tried to. Do you guys now anything that I can do/say to help her to not be so depressed? thanks

20090304101435AAtmxrZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I convince him that it's worth to start a relationship?	Ok, so I started liking this guy around a year ago back in last year's track season, and we flirted a lot. This year, I find out that he 'used' to like me from a friend. I see him around the school hallways and we don't talk. Then, one day after school when our friends weren't around, we talked a bit and ended up kissing twice. (He did it) So then I add him on facebook and we start talking. It all ends up with us meeting up and checking to see if there's chemistry. We make out in his car and then talk things out. Then, we agree to see if it's going to work out or not tomorrow. So then tomorrow comes and we talk it out in msn. He tells me that he hesitates because I'm three years younger, even though I don't act or look it, and that means that I can't do what he can or go to places where he can go.  I tell him that I won't stop him from doing them. He can still go. And then he also tells me that he might move in three months to either Peru or England to stay, since he's going to college. I tell him that we could at least start something these three months. It's better than nothing at all. But he says that he'd rather not work on something that he knows it going to end up breaking off in the end. He doesn't want to get my hopes up. I dont know how to convince him that I'm worth it. I mean, he's really sweet, and a great guy. What should I do to get him to see that the time that we could have together would be worth it? (P.S. I also talked to him about how his friends would talk if we went out, and he said that he doesn't care what people think, and his friends wouldn't act like that. He only cares that I can't do what he can in that area)

20090304102433AA3CvYK	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is correct way to handle this situation?	One of my close friends called me today to tell me that her husband confessed that he "likes" me and is attracted to me.  I am so blown away and I am totally confused as to what I am supposed to say or do.  He also tried to claim that he had called me in the past, which to my recollection, has not happened.  I told her that I wasn't saying he was a liar, but I don't ever remember giving him my number, nor do I remember receiving a phone call from him.  She said he fumbled alot with this particular part of the conversation, and she is worried that he may be hiding something else or is using me as a scape goat.  I told her that I never felt as if he was ever flirting or coming on to me in any situation, and that because of everything, that I won't be coming to their house for a while because of how uncomfortable it would be.  I told her she is more than welcomed to come to my house at any given time, and that she can call me anytime to talk about it, but I won't put myself in a situation that would upset her, or could be misinterpreted.  I hope beyond hope, that I never gave him the wrong idea, and I am waiting for her to return my call so I can make sure that I never overstepped my boundaries, and if so, I really want to apologize to her, even if I did, it was never intentional or with some sort of motive.  I am so upset, and I feel like somewhere it had to have been my fault, that because we get along and talk as group very openly, that I gave him the wrong idea.  I am not attracted to him at all, and only look at him as a friend.  I don't want this to come between her and I, but if it does, then I guess I would have to understand that I might do the same if it were me.  If our friendship, by some miracle, isn't ruined by this, how am I supposed to handle things when I am around him (if that ever happens) at some point in the future.  I really don't feel as if I was in the wrong at anytime, but I still feel guilty for being part of the problem.      Any advice is appreciated.  Thanks in advance.
20090304102524AAySskl	Family & Relationships;Family	Can a parent explain to me why my friend's parents didnt forgive her and led her to suicide?	I had a great friend, a girl my age, 16, who took her life 1 year a go. She was a great girl, but joined bad crowds, got sidetracked, did some wrong stuff many teens do, like drinking. It was a bad phase, don't know why she followed that road. She became disrespectful to her parents and somewhat mean to her lil sister. But she did no crime, and wasn't on drugs. Since eneded up getting a kinda harsh punioshment from her parents.    Was grounded from almost everything, lost their trust, had a really bad time. Since she was a good girl, that was devastating to her. She begged for forgiveness and their trust, but they denied, said she had to pay the consequences of her actions, were extremely harsh in my opinion. I know she was being sincere, but her partents stuck to that harsh punishment and she heard kind hard words from them, like she didn't desrve her trust, things like that that hurt a lot when coming from parents.   She changed completely, actually she get back to her true character. Did everything to make up for her mistakes, apologized to her sister, made up with her, but didn't get her parents to trust her. She felt like trash, like her life was destroyed forever. She volunteered for community services and did a great job with homeless children. I tried to help her, give her hope, but she wqs emotionally devastated. One day she told me God knew she sincerely regretted her mistakes, had made up for them, fixed everything, her slate was clean. She thought her good deeds had been bigger than her mistakes and, since her life was destroyed, she could leave in peace. At first I didn't realize she was thinking about suicide, but then I had a terrible feeling, tried to hep her and even talked to her parents.But it was too late, she took her life.   Today, a year later, her parents are still devastated, though I think they are responsible for that they suffer so much that I feel sorry for them. But I can't understand. They were extremely harsh, humilliated the fgirl, refused to gave her love and trust though she was sincere and did everything to make up for her mistakes. they had to correct, ok, but not davastate her emotionally. And now they are in despair, though they rejected her and wouldnt give her any other chance. Can someone explain this to me? I cant understand, where was the uncontional love? This whole thing devastated me too, I cant get over it.

20090304102935AAUCcY4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice BAD!! Long story!!!?	really need some advice. I'm at my breaking point and I don't know if I'm in the wrong or is my fiance. The thing is, i'm a stay at home mom of two (ages 1&2) and i'm expecting my third and last child. The problem i'm having is that i'm trying to juggle online college, the kids, the house, and being pregnant! IT IS HARD!    The father sometimes helps out with the kids when he's off but has been slacking lately. He works so he pays for most things even though sometimes he's too cheap for the things we may need and I come out of pocket from the little money " I try to save up". He buys me gifts sometimes but, I'm pretty much trapped in the house and that's how he likes it. He's very clingy so I have no friends and don't go anywhere. He does a lot of things without consulting in me and, I guess it's not my job to say anything since I don't work.    I know he loves me (atleast i think he does) but, I feel really neglected. Almost to the point where I wish I had another guy to talk to, but, who would want someone with three young kids right? lol.   Anyway, recently he's decided to join LT. F. Center, you know the type that's almost like a country club with the women that wear the two piece skimpy outfits. He also mentioned how they have co-ed showers so of course he comes home freshly showered, I'm sure he had to go try that out.    He works 2nd shift so he works from 12am to 9pm. Basically that's the whole day! I'm responsible for all the house work and the kids, morning to night. He could have worked an earlier shift but, this is the one he chose. On top of it instead of working out earlier in the day, before work, he goes after work and stays till like, 12 or 1am. I feel like a single mom!    I'm pregnant so I have no choice but, to stay in the house, I can't do too much lifting and moving since this is my third pregnancy, or I start contracting, clearly I would like to go to the gym too, I've always stayed in shape and I atleast should walk while i'm pregnant to keep everything tight.    He tells me we can go as a family on the weekeneds. When do I get free time? I told him i'd rather hang with my old girlfriends who wonder when we'll see each other again or something to be by myself and he got upset about it. He played the guilt card to make me feel bad like, I don't want to be around him and the kids.    What should I do? I would like to work or actually go to school without it being online but, he doesn't want me to so he makes sure I don't have time to. I don't need any sarcasm, this is a cry for help! What should I do? We are both neglecting each other because, I'm usually not in a good mood after being at home All day and night, and doing everything! So when he comes in i'm usually near sleep and he's on the computer or video game. I want to know will I have to worry about him being with a lot of women between the hours of 9:30p and 1am?

I have been talking to this guy for 2 years online.....and we've never met...we've never even talked on the phone....we talk on yahoo messenger almost everyday....and in the first year....I fell hopelessly in love with him....or at least I think I do...I would have done anything he would tell me to do....I would have forsaken all of my rules for him...and I would have oversighted my limits for him....but now....it seems like I don't feel the same for him....like I do anticipate that he come online....I do think about him....but like....there's nothing there....god...this is just so wierd. People describe love as when the stomach flutters when you think about that person etc..but for me, I feel nothing.       Could it be that I never really loved him? That I thought I did?       Has someone else gone through this?

In order to show our appreciation for those who come out (and are not invited to the reception), we're having punch and desserts in the church basement for everyone who attends the ceremony.       The bridal party will stay only as long as it takes to process the receiving line, and then go off to get the pictures taken. Those invited to the reception will make their way to the restaurant for dinner, drinks, and merriment shortly after the punch reception.      How should I word this open invite to the church congregations so that:   1) They don't take it as gift grubbing. I would say "gifts are graciously declined" but I don't want to squelch anyone who really does want to give something. "Gifts are not expected"? Not say anything about presents?   2) They don't expect the bridal party to linger, thinking this is the only reception. I don't want to say blatantly "There's another reception that you're not invited to and we have better things to do". I really do want them to enjoy themselves for an hour or so, even if we have to take off.      Cost really does prohibit inviting everyone to the evening reception, and we just want to do a punch reception as a thanks for everyone who comes to witness our marriage. I'm sure those involved in churches understand the dilemma!

20090304121613AAOIeO2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies:  This is my last gesture to her...can I win her over?	I met her a year ago.  I never returned her calls because I thought she was "just" a model.  But then 6 months ago, I asked her to help with a charity of mine, and she was so excited.  The more I got to know her, the more I feel for her.  But she tells me that since I first met her, she's become very religious...and since I am not the same religion as her...there's no future.      I can't help how I feel about her, and I've tried to stop seeing her numerous times, but she cries and begs me to stay.  Literally.  We talk for hours on the phone...and honestly...I can't help how I feel.  She's my motifs to my music, my Layla...what Daisy Buchanan is to Gatsby.  I am a professional writer, and my second manuscript is very promising.  The thing is...the main female character, the love interest, is based on her.  She's read the manuscript and loves it.  I am going to tell her that she was my muse for the whole book.  She really is.  I don't know what else to do...ladies...if you were her...and someone wrote a book with you as a muse...would that win you over?

20090304114654AA3ihAW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys who don't want babies, what if your gf wanted to use a sperm donor clinic, would you breakup with her?	Im 34 and my bf doesn't want kids now, he says maybe later (like 5 yrs) but i can't count on that, what if he changes his mind or we break up then i'll have waited for nothing or risk the health of my child.      I don't want to break up at all bc he is my soulmate, my best friend, my greatest lover and my warrior. I was thinking of getting artificially inseminated - but i don't know how he'll react when i tell him. He wouldn't have to do anything with the child if he didn't want to. I am financially sound on my own and my parents have promised to take care of it while i'm at work and babysit whenever i need.       Guys who love their gfs but don't want kids - how would you react to her decision to have a sperm donor baby?
20090304115022AAcLiA9	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I gracefully NOT hug people anymore?	OK, this isn't as weird as it sounds...it is because I am HIGHLY allergic to many colognes and perfumes, as well as wool and  pet dander.  For the past few months, when family, friends, coworkers give me a hug, my neck, face and even chest will break out horribly...I mean it will burn and turn beet red and I have to wash it and wait 2 hours before it goes down.  I get so panicky when I get this reaction, it is not fun - and if I am not anywhere where I can wash the skin, it stings forever.  So, I am trying to figure out how to gracefully get out of hugging anybody!!!  I know people are understanding, but when someones comes at you for a hug...I feel terrible to say that I cannot accept their hug.  Any suggestions on how to handle this?
20090304121939AAXTrYZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Layoff debate..what do you  think?	Sorry, wrong topic, but I always get good answers in my favorite section!      So my co-workers and I are debating about how employees should be lay-off (god forbid that happens), and so I was saying that if the company was losing money and had to cut somewhere, it would be better to make a minor paycut on everyone instead of a certain person or group of people. My co-worker goes on to say that if anybody that would have the most difficult time recovering would be him since he has to pay child support. My answer to that was that everyone has their own financial obligations, and to use a child as an excuse to not get laid-off should not be valid. I gave an example as to say that I have credit card debt. Should someone feel sorry for me and not lay me off because of it? No. Same thing as someone with a family to feed, their reason for survival should not be considered more valid. I believe that work performance and senority should decide who stays and who goes.      So if you were an employer and had to choose which people to lay off, would you consider on their personal financial background or simply their work performance?

20090304121646AASO7Ih	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to treat your loved one when she is married to someone else?	Hi,   Perhaps, my life has many sad stories and is full of broken relationships. One of such stories is about a very beautiful girl (my friend) I used to love since I was 10. She didn't love me for almost 11 years and treated me like a good friend. But sooner, she got closer to me and fell in love with me the time when she was engaged to some one else. None of us could do anything against her parent's will. She got married to him, went abroad and has a daughter. 5 years have passed, but I still love her...of course this is a 16 year old love! I don't know if she still loves me but she is coming back wid her family to spend 2 months at my home. Now, how am I gonna deal with her and her husband? Of course, my heart will be torn apart to see her away from me and there will be some jealousy in my part that i don't want to show...How wud i behave like a gentleman? please help me :(   (please don't advise me to get into another relationship becoz my heart has been so much hurt in these relationships that i feel as if it bleeds)

20090304121226AA5INtK	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Engagement Party Dilemma!?	So here's the thing, my sister-in-law told me that she and my mom are going to throw me and my fiance' an engagement party on March 14. I was pretty excited about it, because that was the only weekend that both of my best friends will be in town *they go to college 3 hours away, and won't be home again until May. (One is the maid of honor, one just a bridesmaid) When my fiance' told his mom, she said that was the weekend she may go to SC to visit her dad.. and this might be the last chance she gets to go. *I live in TN* She won't know if she is going for sure until March 11, but that is too short notice to wait and plan the party then.      So my dilemma is this, should we go ahead and have the party without his parents, or have the party another weekend without my friends here, or put it off until May when everyone will be able to attend. We have been engaged since Christmas and our wedding is set for March 20, 2010.      Thanks so much for your help! :)

He moved away, and I don't even have his phone number anymore because I lost it. Now that I think about it, he looked older than 30. He has a very common name so I don't think I could look him up or anything. I think I know what town he lives in. Is there any way to find out??

20090304122624AAHlPqb	Family & Relationships;Friends	This old guy keeps talking to me on my walk home from school. How do i ask him to stop, without offending him?	Okay so im 13 and i walk home from school most of the time. But about 2 weeks ago i had dropped my binder and all my things fell out. Well there was like this 40 something year old guy that came to help me, and i thanked him for that, but ever since then i've been seeing this guy everywhere.      Like i saw him at the mall when i was with my friends, in this restaurant i went to with my family, and even at my sisters doctors appointment. He never says anything though. But last Friday i was walking to school and out of no where he comes with this huge truck asking me if i needed a ride i said no thanks, and hes like well your going to be late for your math class. I was just looking at him like are you nuts. And then i asked him how he knew that, and he started playing dumb and is like talk to you later and drove away.       Then on Monday i was walking home from school, and he was already standing on the sidewalk like he was waiting for something. I was acting like i didnt no him, but then he just started talking to me, and asking me a bunch of questions, like to your parents let you carry your keys, and do you have any older siblings, where do your parents work. I answered them by changing the subject though.       I managed to avoid him yesterday by walking a different route, but today he caught onto that route and keeps talking to me. I don't know whether hes trying to be nice or just being a weird old guy, but he does seem kind of nice. Its just i don't want to talk to him anymore. So in your opinion whats a good way to ask him to stop walking with me without offending him? I don't want to make him fell bad because he really does seem like a nice guy.

20090304122219AAWfL6j	Family & Relationships;Friends	What makes people from the same group of friends behave so differently towards others?	So the skater group at my school consists of probably five main people. All of them, except for one, as far as I can see give everybody outside of their little group the cold shoulder, more than likely make fun of them and just be plain mean. But the one that doesn't is a very friendly, nice person that talks to everybody, and doesn't brag about the parties of the most popular girl in school, even though they are invited to them, but instead focus on playing hockey. How does this happen? How can this person be so real, without slipping into behaving the same way as the rest of their group? Their parents? Morals?

20090304114853AASgZlC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help Me!!  I need advice!!?	First let me say that I have been married for almost 5 years to this man and we have a wonderful 3 year old daughter. My question is, that I am having some physical agressive problems with mine and my husbands relationshop. It all started about 3 years ago when we were under some stress and he has had seizures(epilepsy) his whole life but at the time was not properly medicated, we would fight, the it lead to him pushing me and chocking me. In the last year he has got on the right medication and our problems got a little better for a few months and now they are slowly progressing back down that dark road of cruelty. I love him very much and it is hard for me to leave but I am to the point that I feel that If I don't I'm putting my daughter in harms way even though he has never harmed her, I didn't think that he would harm me. In his defense I have never recieved a bruise or broken bone, maybe a scratch once or twice and a lot of soreness but nothing bad enough to the point of battle wounds. I have recetly been laid off and since the he has been real verbally abusive as to my contributation to the household finances. I don't have any friends or family that I can stay with or feel that I can tell about this, I am very ashamed and scared. I do not want to go to a shelter and have many times contemplated calling the police but know that without any marks I am left with only a he said she said situation. He has threatened me if I leave he will fight me for custody of our daughter and I don't have the resources to fight back, his family does have money. I am only asking because I feel stuck and realize that I'm in a bad situation and I want out. Thank you so much for your opinions and ideas, I will be glad to recieve all of them. Have a nice day.
20090304115014AAT9a2y	Family & Relationships;Family	Help. Family trouble with a younger brother...?	Ok so my brother is aged 11 and is extremely violent. However this is only around me and my parents have never seen him.    (I'm 14)   He has threatened to hurt me many times and I'm getting sick of it!   He has cut my hand with a knife (only a small mark was made and I didn't tell my parents). He has bruised my arm and scratched my arm...which then makes it look like I self-harm.       The reason I don't tell my parents is because they say I have something to do with it. I am a reason he hurts me and I was messing about or arguing.       A couple of minutes ago he attacked me and jumped on my head and punched me, the reason for this? My mum had gone upstairs, my dad is taking the dog for a walk and he had just been told off and grounded!      I know this sounds pathetic but I seriously need some help.      If I grass on him he'd probably hurt me even more...I've tried that one.      xx

20090304115207AAAKyvg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Marriage in the Military...?	Kay, so I'm 18. Going on 19 really soon. I love my fiance. I have since 8th grade when we started dating. She is completely obsessed with me, and feels every bit of affection towards me that I do towards her.      Here's my issue though... I'm going into the Navy. With 6-8 month deployments. Now, I left to Washington and she was alone in Arizona for 3 months and we were absolutely fine. She didn't think I was ever coming back too and she still stayed faithful the whole time.      We're both really mature for our age. She absolutely is disgusted in the thought of cheating. All she wants is to stay home and raise our baby, (not sure if its coming, she's 6 days late on her period though, and we HAVE been trying to conceive)      I'm just soooo worried that being as young as we are we wont work out. I don't want to divorce. I want to see my baby grow up. That's all I want. Just to have my family. I don't care if I'm young and should enjoy life. I want to enjoy my life with her and my baby. That's all I want.       Does anyone have any tips to settle my poor little mind haha.?
20090304115208AA7JFhd	Family & Relationships;Family	Help girls regarding teenage daughter...?	Long story- I'll make it short. I'm a single dad and my daughter is 16. As I work shifts, we take turns cleaning. I was folding the laundry- went to put it away- just on top of her dresser. Sat on bed to pick up her smelly socks (teenage daughters are allergic to laundry hampers)- noticed funny hard lump.   Went to straighten duvet- purple dildo fell out of bed.   Grabbed latex gloves- put back under her pillow- accidentally unveiled large stash of straight and lesbian porn.      I spoke to my ex-wife she mentioned daughter approached her to buy it but refused.      I really do not know how to approach this one- I don't want to push her away to witch- ex wife- but also do not really approve of such in house also worried of possibility she get involved in internet cam session with boys.
